50|$|Another {{important}} {{property of}} the isotropic model is the inevitable existence of a time singularity: time flow is not continuous, but stops or reverses after time reaches some (very large or very small) value. Between singularities, time flows in one direction, away from the singularity (arrow of time). In the open model, there is one time singularity so time is limited at one end but unlimited at the other, while in the closed model there are two singularities that <b>limit</b> <b>time</b> at both ends (the Big Bang and Big Crunch).|$|E

50|$|The most {{effective}} way to prevent sunburn is {{to reduce the amount of}} UV radiation reaching the skin. The strength of sunlight is published in many locations as a UV Index. The World Health Organization recommends to <b>limit</b> <b>time</b> in midday summer sun (between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.), to watch the UV Index, to seek shade, to wear protective clothing (including a wide-brim hat), and to use sunscreen. Sunlight is generally strongest when the sun is close to the highest point in the sky. Due to time zones and daylight saving time, this is not necessarily at 12 noon, but often one to two hours later.|$|E

40|$|According to socioemotional {{selectivity}} theory, older adults’ {{emotional well-being}} stems {{from having a}} <b>limited</b> future <b>time</b> perspective that motivates them to maximize well-being in the “here and now. ” Presumably, then, older adults’ time horizons are associated with emotional competencies that boost positive affect and dampen negative affect, but little research has addressed this. Using a U. S. adult life-span sample (N = 3, 933; 18 – 93 years), we found that a 2 -factor model of future time perspective (future opportunities; <b>limited</b> <b>time)</b> fit the data better than a 1 -factor model. Through middle age, people perceived the life-span hourglass as half full—they focused more on future opportunities than <b>limited</b> <b>time.</b> Around Age 60, the balance changed to increasingly perceiving the life-span hourglass as half empty—they focused less on future opportunities and more on <b>limited</b> <b>time,</b> even after accounting for perceived health, self-reported decision-making ability, and retirement status. At all ages, women’s time horizons focused more on future opportunities compared with men’s, and men’s focused more on <b>limited</b> <b>time.</b> Focusing on future opportunities was associated with reporting less preoccupation with negative events, whereas focusing on <b>limited</b> <b>time</b> was associated with reporting more preoccupation. Older adults reported less preoccupation with negative events, and this association was stronger after controlling for their perceptions of <b>limited</b> <b>time</b> and fewer future opportunities, suggesting that other pathways may explain older adults’ reports {{of their ability to}} disengage from negative events.

5000|$|Light: There are {{two types}} of light- {{ultraviolet}} (UV) and visual light as perceived by the human eye- {{that need to be addressed}} within collections management and care. The effects of visual light exposure is cumulative, but visual light is necessary to view and safely handle objects within a collection, which means that standards should be established to <b>limit</b> <b>time</b> and intensity levels of visual light exposure, without risking visitor or staff safety. UV light, on the other hand, is not necessary for viewing or handling of collections, and as such should be eliminated as much as possible through the use of filters in order to prevent damage such as yellowing or disintegration.|$|E
5000|$|For eight days, CT 26 cleared {{stubborn}} resistance {{across the}} city of Aachen, which required every building and cellar to be searched and enemy troops killed or captured. Objectives normally assigned to larger units {{had to be taken}} by companies, even platoons. Artillery and mortar fire prepared the way for the riflemen supported by a tank or tank destroyer. To <b>limit</b> <b>time</b> in the streets as they advanced, CT 26 progressed through connected cellars where available or knocked out the walls from one building to the next to stay inside. [...] After Lieutenant Colonel Corley called for a 155-mm rifle and demonstrated that it could knock down substantial stone walls that withstood bombardment from tanks, Seitz sent one of the big rifles to support Lieutenant Colonel Daniels's battalion as well. The Germans stiffly resisted CT 26's attack against the center of the city, Farwick Park and its buildings, and even briefly recaptured some ground in fierce counterattacks.|$|E
50|$|Steel Diver {{consists}} of 3 main modes: Missions, Periscope Strike, and Steel Commander. Missions is further {{broken down into}} 2 modes: Campaign and Time Trials. The main gameplay occurs during Campaign. In Campaign, the player uses sliders and dials on the touchscreen to manoeuver a submarine through side-scrolling levels displayed on the top screen, sinking enemy submarines, battleships and avoiding naval mines and depth charges as required. There are seven missions available, playable with different subs and difficulty modes, which usually involve goals such as eliminating enemy fleets or infiltrating enemy bases by reaching the goal in a time <b>limit.</b> <b>Time</b> Trials features the same gameplay style and controls, however the levels are shorter and are not connected to the story, instead being solely to achieve a fast time through a complex path. Periscope Strike mode is played after every successful mission or can also be played separately, {{or as part of}} Steel Commander. This mode sees the player moving the system to rotate a periscope to fire torpedoes at enemy ships. Steel Commander is playable against the CPU or a human opponent via Download Play. It is a strategy game in which the two players command a fleet of battleships and submarines and try to sink each other's fleet.|$|E
