Stress field and torsional stiffness coefficient of the sprocket are calculated according to loads and boundary conditions. Simulation results are in good accordance with the test results. The finite element model and the simulation results provide useful guidance for design and test of the sprocket.

40|$|Research in {{the field}} of {{hard-facing}} of various parts mechanical systems' are being done for technical and techno-economic reasons. The reasons for introducing the new reparation technologies by hard-facing are numerous: three quarters of all the mechanical parts of engineering could be regenerated or manufactured by hard facing; the working <b>life</b> <b>of</b> the repaired part reaches or even exceeds the working <b>life</b> <b>of</b> a new part, while the working <b>life</b> <b>of</b> the hard <b>faced</b> manufactured part surpasses several times the working <b>life</b> <b>of</b> the new part manufactured by some other technology. Large number of damaged and, frequently even broken parts, cause terminations of the working process. Thus, due to difficulties in procurement of new, mainly imported parts, the alternative solution must be applied. It is sown that the a proper choice of the hard-facing technology is related to the complex procedure of checking the quality <b>of</b> the hard <b>faced</b> layer, what indicates that the reparatory operations could be performed only in specialized regeneration workshops, which are furnished with adequate equipment and corresponding expert and skilled staff.

This is driven, paradoxically, by modern medicine's increased {{ability to provide}} effective pain relief {{on the one hand}} and an acknowledgement of its limitation in delivering a cure for certain diseases on the other. With many Muslims suffering from such incurable diseases worldwide, they too are now faced with the decision of whether to avail themselves of pain relief offered within the framework of scientific medicine. However, while the general ethos of palliative care which is to promote the quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> those <b>facing</b> life-limiting illnesses is consistent with Islamic values, this paper explores whether the same can be submitted for modern methods of pain control. The investigation will be steered by two overriding questions. First, if pain and suffering could, as highlighted in the primary sources of Islamic Law, lead to the expiation of sins, can pain relief be taken? Second, is it religiously permissible to choose pain treatment options that could bring about iatrogenic addiction, the hastening of death and the impairment or obliteration of consciousness...|$|R
