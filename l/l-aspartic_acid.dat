L-Glutamic acid also enhances the formation of the initial products of inositol phospholipid hydrolysis, 3 H-inositol di-(3 H-IP 2) and triphosphate (3 H-IP 3). In the absence of extracellular Ca 2 +, L-glutamic acid fails to enhance 3 H-IP 1 formation, but still increases 3 H-IP 2 and 3 H-IP 3 formation. The stimulation of 3 H-IP 1 formation elicited by L-glutamic acid is reduced by DL- 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonovaleric acid (APV) and gamma-glutamylglycine and, to a lesser extent, by 2, 3 -cis-piperidindicarboxylic acid (PDA). The stimulation of 3 H-IP 1 formation by kainic acid is antagonized by PDA and gamma-glutamylglycine, but it is almost unaffected by APV. The increase in 3 H-IP 1 formation elicited by quisqualic acid is not reduced by any of the dicarboxylic amino acid receptor antagonists that we have tested.

This makes it ideal {{for the construction of}} a real time, naked eye sensor. Derivatized polyaniline has previously been reported as a colorimetric sensor in solution. We plan to create a more practical sensor by synthesizing hydroxyl functionalized polyaniline thin films. In this study, we designed a process to functionalize polyaniline and deposit it as a thin film on quartz or silicon substrate via a dip coating process. To demonstrate the use of derivatized PANI in biosensing applications, derivatized and underivatized PANI thin films were treated with solutions of <b>L-aspartic</b> (Asp) <b>acid</b> at concentrations ranging from 10 - 8 mM to 103 mM and monitored utilizing UV-Vis spectroscopy.

The underivatized PANI films showed no colorimetric response indicating the hydroxyl functionalized PANI films are a more ideal material for a biosensing and naked eye detection.

50|$|The oxaloacetate/aspartate {{family of}} amino acids is {{composed}} of lysine, asparagine, methionine, threonine, and isoleucine. Aspartate can be converted into lysine, asparagine, methionine and threonine. Threonine also gives rise to isoleucine. All of these amino acids contain different mechanisms for their regulation, some being more complex than others. All the enzymes in this biosynthetic pathway are subject to regulation via feedback inhibition and/or repression at the genetic level. As is typical in highly branched metabolic pathways, there is additional regulation at each branch point of the pathway. This type of regulatory scheme allows control over the total flux of the aspartate pathway {{in addition to the}} total flux of individual amino acids.

50|$|Big molecules, {{also called}} high {{molecular}} weight, HMW molecules, are mostly oligomers or polymers of small molecules or chains of amino acids. Thus, within pharma sciences, peptides, proteins and oligonucleotides constitute the major categories.Peptides and proteins are oligomers or polycondensates of amino acids linked {{together by a}} carboxamide group. The threshold {{between the two is}} as at about 50 amino acids. Because of their unique biological functions, a significant and growing part of new drug discovery and development is focused on this class of biomolecules. Their biological functions are determined by the exact arrangement or sequence of different amino acids in their makeup. For the synthesis of peptides, four categories of fine chemicals, commonly referred to as peptide building blocks (PBBs), are key, namely amino acids (=starting materials), protected amino acids, peptide fragments and peptides themselves. Along the way, the molecular weights increase from about 102 up to 104 and the unit prices from about $100 up to $105 per kilogram. However, {{only a small part of}} the total amino acid production is used for peptide synthesis. In fact, L-glutamic acid, D, L-methionine, <b>L-aspartic</b> <b>acid</b> and L-phenylalanine are used in large quantities as food and feed additives. About 50 peptide drugs are commercialized. The number of amino acids that make up a specific peptide varies widely. At the low end are the dipeptides. The most important drugs with a dipeptide (L-alanyl-L-proline) moiety are the “-pril” cardiovascular drugs, such as Alapril (lisinopril), Captoril (captopril), Novolac (imidapril) and Renitec (enalapril). Also the artificial sweetener Aspartame (N-L-α-Aspartyl-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester) is a dipeptide. At the high end there is the anticoagulant hirudin, MW ≈ 7000, which is composed of 65 amino acids.|$|E
50|$|Fungal {{growth is}} {{affected}} by the presence of optimal nutrients necessary for growth, by the presence of minerals, by temperature, by pH and by osmotic pressure. The presence of organic nutrients in the medium that C. coronatus finds itself in favors the formation of vegetative germ tubes, with glucose inducing vegetative germ growth far more effectively than asparagine. In terms of necessary nutrients for growth and survival, glucose and trehalose are both good sources of carbon for C. coronatus, other adequate sources of carbon are fructose, mannose, maltose, glycerol, oleate, stearate, palmitate and casamino acids, whereas galactose, starch and glycogen are all poor sources of carbon for C. coronatus. When looking at nitrogen, complex nitrogen sources seem to be best suited for optimal C. coronatus growth, however L-asparagine, ammonium salts, <b>L-aspartic</b> <b>acid,</b> glycine, L-alanine, L-serine, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and urea can all adequately be used by the fungus as nitrogen sources to varying extents. This fungus is unable to utilize nitrate as a nitrogen source. Certain minerals are able to stimulate fungal growth, for C. coronatus these minerals are Magnesium and Zinc. In terms of temperature effects on fungal growth, the temperature at which C. coronatus growth is at an optimal stage on agar is 27 °C, and the minimum temperature at which it is able to grow on agar is 6 °C. Though there is no growth seen below 6 °C, good survival of C. coronatus has been demonstrated at temperatures of 1 °C. Finally, the maximum growth temperature of C. coronatus on agar is 33 °C, this maximum growth temperature increases to 40 °C when the fungus is grown in liquid culture.In terms of pH effects on C. coronatus, the optimal pH broad range of growth for this fungus is pH 5.5 to pH 7, however sub-optimal growth can occur anywhere within the range of pH 3.5 to pH 8. In terms of pH dependent physiology, there is more frequent production of germ tubes on mildly acidic or neutral media (range of pH 5 to pH 7) with the greatest percent of germination occurring at pH 5. In addition, the percentage of spores that produce secondary spores is far greater on acidic media than on both neutral and basic media. In addition to organic nutrient and mineral presence, temperature and pH, osmotic pressure also has an effect on C. coronatus growth and dispersal. The spores of this fungus are more likely to germinate at lower osmotic pressures, and any medium with osmotic pressures greater than 10 atm will almost entirely inhibit germination of this fungus.|$|E

In this way, widely available amino acids can be isolated and utilized {{as an alternative}} feedstock {{for the production of}} nitrogen containing chemicals which are nowadays based on naphtha. The first step in the envisioned route from cyanophycin towards nitrogen containing chemicals is the complete or selective hydrolysis of cyanophycin. In this study, we investigated the acid and base catalyzed hydrolysis of cyanophycin. Acid catalyzed hydrolysis of cyanophycin yields both <b>L-aspartic</b> <b>acid</b> and L-arginine at comparable rates and is therefore suitable for complete hydrolysis. Upon base catalyzed hydrolysis, the rate of L-arginine liberation is overall significantly higher than that of <b>L-aspartic</b> <b>acid,</b> which enables selective hydrolysis of cyanophycin to yield a residue with commercially interesting polyaspartic acid functionality. To conclude this study, a cyanophycin residue with reduced L-arginine content was prepared and isolated. Keywords: Cyanophycin, Hydrolysis, Amino Acids, Biobased, L-Arginine, L-Aspartic-Acid...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigated}} {{the ability of}} a series of amino acids to act as cloud condensation nuclei using a static thermal gradient diffusion type cloud condensation nucleus counter. Particles of pure dry l-glycine, glycyl-glycine, l-serine, l-methionine, l-glutamic acid, <b>l-aspartic</b> <b>acid,</b> and l-tyrosine were studied as well as internally mixed dry particles containing ammonium sulfate and {{one or two of the}} following amino acids: l-methionine, <b>l-aspartic</b> <b>acid,</b> or l-tyrosine. The amino acids ranged in water solubility from high (> 100 g/L), intermediate (10 - 100 g/L), low (3 - 10 g/L), to very low (< 3 g/L). With the exception of l-methionine and l-tyrosine, all the studied pure amino acid particles activated as though they were fully soluble, although Kohler theory modified to account for limited solubility suggests that the activation of the intermediate and low solubility amino acids l-serine, l-glutamic acid, and <b>l-aspartic</b> <b>acid</b> should be limited by solubility. Activation of mixed particles containing at least 60 % dry mass of l-tyrosine was limited by solubility, but the activation of the other investigated mixed particles behaved as if fully soluble. In general, the results show that particles containing amino acids at atmospherically relevant mixture ratios are good cloud condensation nuclei...|$|E
