500|$|The 50th {{anniversary of}} the novel's release was met with {{celebrations}} and reflections on its impact. Eric Zorn of the Chicago Tribune praises Lee's [...] "rich use of language" [...] but writes that the central <b>lesson</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> [...] "courage isn't always flashy, isn't always enough, but is always in style". Jane Sullivan in the Sydney Morning Herald agrees, stating that the book [...] "still rouses fresh and horrified indignation" [...] as it examines morality, a topic that has recently become unfashionable. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie writing in The Guardian states that Lee, rare among American novelists, writes with [...] "a fiercely progressive ink, {{in which there is}} nothing inevitable about racism and its very foundation is open to question", comparing her to William Faulkner, who wrote about racism as an inevitability. Literary critic Rosemary Goring in Scotland's The Herald notes the connections between Lee and Jane Austen, stating the book's central theme, that [...] "one’s moral convictions are worth fighting for, even at the risk of being reviled" [...] is eloquently discussed.|$|E
500|$|Jack Garner of the Democrat and Chronicle {{gave the}} film {{a rating of}} 8 out of 10, {{concluding}} that he was pleasantly surprised at the documentary's entertainment value. He described it as educational, despite Fucks repetitive use of the word. In The Boston Globe Wesley Morris commented that the director's flippant style was beneficial, enabling him to make serious educational points to the audience. Sally Foster of Film Threat said that {{the crux of the}} film was the debate about freedom of speech, and that the film was funny and thought-provoking. A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times: [...] "Mr. Anderson's movie is staged as a talking-head culture-war skirmish between embattled upholders of propriety (or repression, if you prefer) and proponents of free expression (or filth), but its real <b>lesson</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the two sides depend upon each other. Or rather, that the continued vitality of the word—its unique ability to convey emphasis, relieve stress, shock grown-ups and function as adverb, noun, verb, intensifier and what linguists call 'infix'—rests on its ability to mark an edge between the permissible and the profane". In the Chicago Reader, Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote that the documentary was an amusing film and an educational commentary on the word. According to Glenn Garvin of The Miami Herald, the film was an expansive merging of perspectives from politics, history and culture.|$|E
2500|$|In The New York Times Book Review, {{conservative}} writer David Brooks {{offered his}} [...] "harsh assessment" [...] that the insights Rand {{had about the}} dangers of collectivism were [...] "made absurd only by the philosophy she piled on top of it." [...] For aspiring writers, he said, [...] "The journals' central <b>lesson</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> one should never underestimate the importance of pomposity." [...] This review produced responses {{in the form of a}} short article in Liberty calling it an [...] "uninformed hatchet job" [...] and a letter from philosopher Allan Gotthelf calling it [...] "the usual sneers".|$|E
50|$|The main <b>lesson</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> like a wildfire, once underway, {{outbreaks}} {{of this kind}} apparently will not subside before most, if not all, of the island’s pisonia is gone.|$|R
30|$|According to {{conventional}} lessons, {{students have to}} remember a body of knowledge; the difference with these <b>lessons</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> students {{have the opportunity to}} remember knowledge and can remember it for a longer time. (T 1, Team discussion 9, Source D).|$|R
5|$|One of {{the primary}} morals of Barbauld's <b>lessons</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{individuals}} <b>are</b> part of a community; in this {{she was part of}} a tradition of female writing that emphasised the interconnectedness of society. Charles, the hero of the texts, explores his relationship to nature, to animals, to people, and finally to God.|$|R
2500|$|Kidnie says of this scene, [...] "the {{language}} {{game has}} suddenly changed and the stakes have been raised. Whereas before {{he seemed to}} mishear or misunderstand her words, Petruchio now overtly tests his wife's subjection by demanding that she concede to his views {{even when they are}} demonstrably unreasonable. The <b>lesson</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Petruchio has the absolute authority to rename their world." [...] Katherina is free to say whatever she wishes, as long she agrees with Petruchio. His apparent victory in the 'language game' is seen in Act 4, Scene 5, when Katherina is made to switch the words [...] "moon" [...] and [...] "sun", and she concedes that she will agree with whatever Petruchio says, no matter how absurd: ...|$|E
2500|$|Mobutu {{also had}} a cordial {{relationship}} with Reagan's successor, George H. W. Bush; {{he was the first}} African head of state to visit Bush at the White House. Even so, Mobutu's relationship with the US radically changed shortly afterward {{with the end of the}} Cold War. With the Soviet Union gone, there was no longer any reason to support Mobutu as a bulwark against communism. Accordingly, the US and other Western powers began pressuring Mobutu to democratize the regime. Regarding the change in US attitude to his regime, Mobutu bitterly remarked: [...] "I am the latest victim of the cold war, no longer needed by the US. The <b>lesson</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> my support for American policy counts for nothing." [...] In 1993, Mobutu was denied a visa by the US State Department after he sought to visit Washington, DC.|$|E
2500|$|The {{organizers}} of the Winter Soldier Investigation took several steps to ensure {{the validity of the}} participants. [...] Each veteran's authenticity was checked before the hearings by the investigation event organizers, and subsequently by reporters and Pentagon officials. In addition, they also gave specific details about their units and the locations where the events had occurred. [...] Those who wanted to testify were carefully screened by the officers of VVAW, and care was taken to verify the service records and testimony of the veterans. After the severe criticism of the accuracy of Mark Lane's book about atrocities a month before the event, the {{organizers of}} the Winter Soldier Investigation made the credibility of the participants a top priority. [...] As noted by one VVAW leader, [...] "The <b>lesson</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we'd better do our work right. We'd better talk to these vets and weed out the bullshitters so that we can't get set up, because we're going to come under attack. [...] We're going to do this right." [...] All veterans participating in Winter Soldier were required to bring their discharge papers (DD-214's) and IDs.|$|E
50|$|One of Socrates' <b>lessons</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{men should}} abstain from foods that might provoke {{a man to}} eat when he has no hunger, and drinks that might provoke him to drink when he has no thirst. He {{went on to say}} that the best sauce in the world is to be hungry.|$|R

40|$|The {{financial}} crises of the 1990 s in many emerging market economies (EMEs) created massive disruption and imposed huge costs of lost output on these economies. 1 One <b>lesson</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> these crises <b>were</b> particularly painful because local firms and households {{had to face}} large exchange rate or interest rate risk, with inadequate hedging possibilities.

60|$|Another {{familiar}} {{fact that}} teaches the same <b>lesson</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{many women who}} have voluntarily attained {{a high degree of}} culture cannot add up their own housekeeping books, though their education in simple arithmetic was compulsory, whereas their higher education has been wholly voluntary. Everywhere we find the same result. The imprisonment, the beating, the taming and laming, the breaking of young spirits, the arrest of development, the atrophy of all inhibitive power except the power of fear, are real: the education is sham. Those who have been taught most know least.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to Richmond," [...] she told me. [...] "Our <b>lesson</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> there are two Richmonds, one in Surrey and one in Yorkshire, and that mine is the Surrey Richmond. The {{distance}} is ten miles. I am to have a carriage, and you are to take me. This is my purse, and you are to pay my charges out of it. O, you must take the purse! We have no choice, you and I, but to obey our instructions. We are not free to follow our own devices, you and I." ...|$|E
50|$|Liao-Fan's Four <b>Lessons</b> (了凡四訓) <b>is</b> a {{book written}} by Yuan Liaofan, {{who was born}} during the Ming Dynasty, in about 1550, in Wujiang County, Jiangsu Province. Yuan wrote the book to teach his son, Yuan Tian-Chi. The {{principal}} idea behind these <b>lessons</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> destiny can <b>be</b> changed through proper cultivation of kindness and humility. Thus one should not be bound by fate, but by one's own actions.|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked what}} the best <b>lesson</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> her mother taught her, Carolina Herrera Jr. replied, [...] "Less is more…" [...] She added about her mother's process, [...] "She's very curious, so she always her eyes open. She's {{constantly}} going to the movies. She'sconstantly reading. When she travels, she goes to every museum there is. It's her interest in life." ...|$|R
60|$|Rollo {{determined}} {{to try the}} experiment; and then he took Mary's book, and asked her where her <b>lesson</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> day. She found the place, and Rollo read a little. He could not understand it very well, and so he concluded that he would rather have Mary go and study her lesson, and then come down and help him make the experiments of oscillation.|$|R
6000|$|... "No. I am much wiser {{now than}} I was once, Joyce. I have learned wisdom beyond the hills. One learns there--in time--but {{sometimes}} {{the lesson is}} learned too late. Shall I tell you what I have learned, Joyce? The gist of the <b>lesson</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I left happiness behind me in the old valley, when I went away from it, happiness and peace and the joy of living. I did not miss these things for a long while; I {{did not even know}} I had lost them. But I have discovered my loss." ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{was silence}} {{for some time}} between them, then Eden said, [...] "Fan, what a strange girl you are! The {{whiteness}} of your soul is such that it has even pained {{me to think of}} it; and now that I have shown you all the blackness of my own, and am sick of it myself, you look very calmly at it, and even try to persuade me that it is not black at all. The one thing you have said which sounds artificial, and like a copy-book <b>lesson,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we all have good and bad in us. What is the bad in you, Fan--what evil does it tempt you to do?" ...|$|E
50|$|The Salt Prince (Slovak: Soľ nad zlato, Czech: Sůl nad zlato, German: Der Salzprinz, Italian: Il Solto Prinzzo) is a Slovak fairy-tale movie {{based on}} a novel by Pavol Dobšinský. The movie's central <b>lesson</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> salt, as it is {{necessary}} for life, is more precious than gold and emeralds.|$|E
40|$|Far {{from being}} purely {{a product of}} the twentieth century, the present {{understanding}} of ‘strategy’ has many reflections in antiquity and beyond. The history of the concept is a rich one, with wisdom carried through the ages rejecting the value of military victory simply for its own sake. Chief amongst these timeless <b>lessons</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> war must serve a political purpose and ultimately ensure a better, more just peace than existed antebellum...|$|R

I read everything I could {{get my hands on}} about Michelangelo....He was the first artist I'd met through my studies who went to work everyday and was paid by his patrons [...] employers for making art. Obviously, I learned encyclopedias from the work, but the practical <b>lesson</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> art could <b>be</b> a profession as well as a passion.|$|R
50|$|Helicopters due {{to their}} {{maneuverability}} are very dangerous opponents when matched against fixed winged aircraft. To this day, the basic <b>lesson</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> fighters should stay away from helicopters, and only attack from high altitudes or at long ranges (beyond visual range with missiles) and only if the situation presents itself.|$|E
5000|$|Andre Sennwald {{wrote in}} The New York Times, [...] "The {{principal}} distinction of this unexpected preachment {{in behalf of}} the hard, Cezanne way in art (using that Greenwich Village master, Robert Montgomery, as an object <b>lesson)</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it affords a reasonably adequate vehicle for the graduation out of very funny shorts into a not-too-funny feature-length production, of Robert Benchley, who plays a character called Oscar".|$|E
50|$|VLOM has {{undoubtedly}} {{brought the}} answer to sustainability a little closer; however, the goal of easy maintenance remains elusive. Perhaps the greatest <b>lesson</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there are currently no ‘off-the-shelf’ solutions which can bypass the need for effective government institutional community water point support. Wherever this problem is unresolved, and {{where there are no}} NGOs or other agencies to fill the gap, sustainability will always be in doubt.|$|E
40|$|In {{malpractice}} lawsuits, taxpayers {{prevailed in}} courtrooms, around arbitration tables, and in settlement negotiations against peddlers of abusive tax shelters. This analysis illustrates how the tax shelter malpractice experience embodies many virtues that yield tax compliance. From these virtues emerge several important lessons {{on how to}} curb aggressive tax planning. Evident from these virtues and <b>lessons</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> malpractice litigation <b>is</b> a powerful tool {{in the sphere of}} tax compliance, and, where possible, reforms should be instituted to further promote its use...|$|R
50|$|Scalzi {{took what}} he learned about Heinlein and {{produced}} four lessons on {{how to create a}} novel centered on characters. These <b>lessons</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> a story should only exist for its characters, make room in the characters for the reader, make the characters talk like people, and make the characters act like people. His novel's themes were based on the four lessons in which to make a character as connectable as possible while still keeping his theme of space military.|$|R

When I think of the President, my heart grows sick within me. I {{do not know how}} it shall be done, but I shall have that scoundrel at my mercy as there is a God in heaven. What an experience, what a <b>lesson,</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> game of cards!" ...|$|R
50|$|Though {{the book}} today serves {{partially}} {{as a historical}} document of the computing industry, some valuable business lessons {{can be learned from}} it. The most important <b>lesson</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a company's culture must change as its operating environment changes. In many ways, Ken Olsen was responsible for much of the innovation that created the personal computer, even though DEC failed to produce any successful personal computer product itself before the book was published.|$|E
50|$|The second <b>lesson</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the {{presence}} of such human outposts in the Murasaki system has been totally irrelevant to the pre-programmed local cycles of destruction and rebuilding. Neither the initial caution against biological and cultural contamination nor the subsequent missionary efforts among the Ihrdizu have had the slightest effect, simply because the ecosystems {{as well as the}} societies are just too alien to suffer or benefit from human actions short of mass slaughter.|$|E
5000|$|Looking back, {{there is}} a lesson in all this for all of us. The lesson is one that we {{sometimes}} had to learn the hard way {{over the past few}} years. But we did learn it. That <b>lesson</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> even potentially destructive forces can be converted into positive forces when we know how to channel them, and when we use common sense and common decency to create a climate of mutual respect and goodwill.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, {{this process}} allows {{the project to}} derive {{knowledge}} and <b>lessons</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> relevant to current policy, from the Cold War archives. The overarching theme of these <b>lessons</b> <b>is</b> realizing <b>that</b> direct military confrontation was avoided, despite the occurrence of critical situations and dilemmas. The results are recommendations for managing or avoiding post-Cold War conflicts, and {{for dealing with the}} proliferation of post war nuclear weapons. Deriving such lessons then becomes applicable to enhancing what is known about Cold War events and themes.|$|R

40|$|The Participatory Action Research team came to Hoto in Pakistan in 1994 {{in order}} to learn if the {{community}} would be interested in participating in a process to improve their water supplies. Hitherto the community-development activities in the village had all failed and NGOs in the region had labelled it as a 'bad' village in which to work. The most important <b>lesson</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> with a little 'push' and motivation from outsiders, the people were able to 'switch their thinking' {{in order to}} assess their water problems...|$|R
