40|$|The {{europium}} (III) {{complex of}} coumarin- 3 -carboxylic acid (C 3 CA) has been prepared and characterized {{on the basis}} of elemental analysis, IR, and emission (photoluminescence and electrochemiluminescence) spectroscopy. The synthesised complex having a formula Eu(C 3 CA) 2 (NO 3) (H 2 O) 2 was photophysically characterized in solution and in the solid state. Electrochemiluminescence, ECL, of the system containing the Eu(III) /C 3 CA complex was studied using an oxide-covered aluminium electrode. The goal of these studies was to show the possibility of the use of electrochemical excitation of the Eu(III) ion in aqueous solution for emission generation. The generated ECL emission was very weak, and therefore its measurements and spectral analysis were carried out with the use of cut-off filters method. The studies proved a predominate role of the <b>ligand-to-metal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> (<b>LMET)</b> in the generated ECL...|$|E

The zig-zag orientation of single polymer chains induced the formation of densely packed coordination structures with multiple intermolecular interactions, resulting in thermal stability above 300 degrees C. They exhibit a high intrinsic emission quantum yield (ca. 80 %) due to their asymmetrical and low-vibrational coordination structures around Eu-III ions.

The europium and terbium containing compounds both exhibit luminescence of the referring trivalent lanthanide ions, giving a red luminescence for Eu 3 + {{and a green}} luminescence for Tb 3 + triggered by an efficient antenna effect of the 4, 4 '-bipyridine linkers. Mixing of different lanthanides in one MOF structure was undertaken to investigate the potential of this MOF system for colour tuning of the luminescence. Based on the gadolinium containing compound, co-doping with different amounts of europium and terbium proves successful and yields solid solutions of the formula 2 ∞[Gd 2 -x-yEuxTbyCl 6 (bipy) 3]* 2 bipy (1 – 8), 0 ≤x, y≤ 0. 5. The series of MOFs exhibits the opportunity of tuning the emission colour in-between green and red.

The luminescence of NdIII, SmIII, and YbIII is sensitized by (LC- 2 H) 2 -, but the <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> from the ligand to the LnIII ions is not complete, resulting in residual ligand emission. The luminescence of the NdIII helicate is very weak due to nonradiative de-excitation processes.

Among all types of solid luminophors, the emissive coordination polymers, especially those based on luminescent trivalent lanthanide ions, exhibit a particularly large scope of light-emitting functionalities, fruitfully investigated in the aspects of chemical sensing, display devices, and bioimaging.

Ternary nano complex of terbium gatifloxacin phenanthroline was synthesized. The composition and structure of ternary complex were characterized by element analysis, Mass Spectrometry (MS), UltraViolet Absorption Spectrometry (UV) and fluorescence spectra(FS). The influences of solubility, thermal stability and luminescent properties of complex as well as addition of phenanthroline secondary ligands on the fluorescence spectra of the ternary complexes were studied. The results of fluorescence spectra analysis showed that partial <b>energy</b> was <b>transferred</b> from Characterization to terbium ions by intramolecular <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> processes, meanwhile, the addition of phenanthroline can effectively increase the luminescence intensity of terbium icons. The complex possessed well luminescence and showed characteristic emission peaks of Tb 3 + under UV light excitation and emitted strong green fluorescence. Moreover, in an ITO/PVK/Tb(GFLX) 3 Phen/Al device, Tb 3 + ion can be excited by intramolecular <b>ligand-to-metal</b> <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> process. The main peak of emission at 545 nm is attributed to 5 D 0 → 7 F 2 transition of the Tb 3 + ion, and this process results in the enhancing green emission.

Here, the postsynthetic {{modification of}} isoreticular metal-organic framework- 3 (IRMOF- 3) with ethyl oxalyl monochloride and ethyl acetoacetate {{followed by the}} chelation of trivalent lanthanide ions afforded efficient near-infrared (Nd 3 +) and visible (Eu 3 + and Tb 3 +) light emitters.

These complexes were synthesized and characterized by elemental analyses, infrared spectroscopy and thermogavimetric analysis. The theoretical complexes geometry data by using Sparkle {{model for the}} calculation of lanthanide complexes (SMLC) is {{in agreement with the}} crystalline structure determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The emission spectra for [Gd(TTA) (3) (TPPO) (2) ] and [Gd(TTA) (2) (NO(3)) (TPPO) (2) ] complexes are associated to T -> S(0) transitions centered on coordinated TTA ligands. Experimental luminescent properties of the bis-TTA complex have been quantified through emission intensity parameters Omega(lambda) (lambda = 2 and 4), spontaneous emission rates (A(rad)), luminescence lifetime (tau), emission quantum efficiency (eta) and emission quantum yield (q), which were compared with those for tris-TTA complex. The experimental data showed that the intensity parameter value for bis-TTA complex is twice smaller than the one for tris-TTA complex, indicating the less polarizable chemical environment in the system containing nitrate ion. A good agreement between the theoretical and experimental quantum yields for both Eu(Ill) complexes was obtained.

A rather small value of the <b>ligand-to-metal</b> charge <b>transfer</b> <b>energy</b> Delta(eff) was indicated by the comparison of the experimental Fe 2 p XAS spectrum with atomic multiplet calculations, reflecting an almost 1 : 1 admixture of d(5) and d(6) L (L hole on the ligand) character in the ground state for Na 5 FeS 4. The broadening of the main peak toward higher energies when going from Na 5 FeS 4 to KFeS 2 is attributed to symmetry lowering from T-d to D- 2 d.

40|$|<b>Energy</b> <b>transfer</b> {{properties}} of novel coumarin-perylene bisimide dendrimer are studied {{by means of}} steady state and time-resolved UV/vis spectroscopy. At low donor excitation density fast (transfer rate ~ 10 ps- 1) and efficient (quantum yield ~ 99. 5 %) donor-acceptor <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> is observed. The random distributions of donor-acceptor orientations and distances result in nonexponential <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> kinetics. The <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> remains independent of excitation density up to densities corresponding to one absorbed photon per 10 dendrimer molecules. At higher excitation densities the transfer rate is found to increase due to excitation of multiple donors per dendrimer. Control of the donor-acceptor <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> rate is achieved by pre-excitation of the acceptor and monitored by prepump-pump-probe experiments, which show that the <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> rate can be decreased {{by a factor of}} 2. The relative orientations of transition dipole moments in the donor and acceptor molecules are found {{to be one of the}} key factors determining the <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> dynamics at high excitation densities. ...|$|R

40|$|Downconversion of one visible photon {{into two}} {{infrared}} photons {{has been reported}} for the lanthanide ion couple (Pr 3 +, Yb 3 +) {{in a variety of}} host lattices. The mechanism responsible for downconversion is controversial and has been reported to be either a two-step <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> process (via two first-order transfer steps, the first being cross relaxation) or cooperative <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> from Pr 3 + to two Yb 3 + ions (a second-order process). Here we report experiments on downconversion for the (Pr 3 +, Yb 3 +) in LiYF 4. Luminescence decay curves of the Pr 3 + emission are recorded {{as a function of the}} Yb 3 + concentration and analyzed using Monte Carlo simulations for both cooperative <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> and <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> through cross relaxation. We obtain a good agreement between experiment and simulations for <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> by cross relaxation but not for cooperative <b>energy</b> <b>transfer.</b> The observation that cross relaxation is more efficient than cooperative <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> is consistent with Judd-Ofelt calculations for the transition probabilities involved in the two <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> processes and the lower probability for the second-order cooperative transfe...|$|R
40|$|The use of <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> {{data and}} models in {{describing}} nonequilibrium polyatomic reaction systems is discussed with {{particular emphasis on}} the information needed for modeling vibrational <b>energy</b> <b>transfer.</b> In the discussion, it is pointed out that key areas of <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> knowledge are still lacking and the available experimental data are limited in scope and are of uneven quality. Despite these limitations, {{it is still possible}} to carry out meaningful simulations of chemical systems in which vibrational <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> is important. The vibrational energy master equation, which is the basis for modeling, and various experiments and calculations that provide the basis for practical <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> models and parametrizations are described. Two examples of gas phase reaction systems are presented in which vibrational <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> is important. The decomposition of norbornene shows how <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> parameters can be obtained from measurements of shock-induced chemical reactions, but even the best such experiments provide only limited information about <b>energy</b> <b>transfer.</b> Chemically activated 2 -methylhexyl radicals illustrate the complex reactions of multiple isomers connected by multiple isomerization pathways and reacting according to multiple decomposition pathways.
