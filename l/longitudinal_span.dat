Starting from the same attempt to explain why Eurasian civilizations have outlived other civilizations that used {{to exist in the}} world, Diamond looks at the geographical differences among different civilizations and the agricultural practices that have arisen from those differences. For example, because of the latitudinal differences between the Eurasian continent and American/African continents—the Eurasian continent has a large <b>longitudinal</b> <b>span</b> while the American/African continents are longitudinally narrow—it is easier for inhabitants of the Eurasian continent to spread the same kind of agricultural products and domesticated animals like wheat, cows and horses. On the other hand, for African and American continents, because of the wide latitudinal differences of different regions, it is hard for the same kind of agricultural products and domesticated animals to spread. Because of this difference, people on Eurasian continent are more likely to develop stronger immune systems and thus their civilizations are more likely to survive. However, according to Acemoglu and Robinson, the theory is incapable of explaining the {{gap between rich and poor}} countries after 1500. It is also powerless in explaining the difference of economic growth between two places with similar or same geographic conditions, like Nogales, Sonora and Nogales, Arizona, North Korea and South Korea and East Germany and West Germany.

Several studies have shown that variance in child and adolescent deviant peer affiliation includes genetic and non-genetic influences, but none have examined longitudinal genetic and environmental stability or change within the context of harsh parenting. To address this gap, we tested the moderating role of harsh parenting on genetic and environmental stability or change of deviant peer affiliation in a <b>longitudinal</b> (<b>spanning</b> one and a half years) study of Chinese child and adolescent twin pairs (N = 993, 52. 0 % female). Using multiple informants (child-and parent-reports) and measurement methods to minimize rater bias, we found that individual differences in deviant peer affiliation at each assessment were similarly explained by moderate genetic and nonshared environmental variance. The longitudinal stability and change of deviant peer affiliation were explained by genetic and nonshared environmental factors. The results also revealed that the genetic variance for deviant peer affiliation is higher in the families with harsher parenting. This amplified genetic risk underscores the role of harsh parenting in the selection and socialization process of deviant peer relationships...|$|R

40|$|The {{structure}} of mass transport in the stratosphere, {{as well as}} its dynamic behaviors, is explored by imposing idealized sea surface temperature (SST) perturbations in an aqua-planet model. Mass transport within stratosphere is simultaneously running through two processes: the diabatic circulation, also well known as the Brewer-Dobson Circulation (BDC), advecting air mass across isentropic surfaces, and the quasi-horizontal mixing ventilating air mass along isentropic surfaces. It is shown that, with an equatorial SST heating, the stratospheric transport will increase in strength, in a circumstance with both BDC and high-latitude isentropic mixing being accelerated. Behaviors of transport, for both BDC and isentropic mixing, turn out to be with more complexities when the imposed SST perturbation being relocated at different ranges of latitudes or expanding itself with larger <b>longitudinal</b> <b>span.</b> Dynamic diagnostics further relate the changes of stratospheric transport mainly to the changes of eddies, which are originated from the induction of SST perturbation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Timing {{drive systems}} of recent {{passenger}} car engines are usually equipped with chain or synchronous belt drives. The comparatively low stiffness of chains and belts, {{combined with the}} large moments of inertia, resulting from moving parts of camshafts and valvetrains, lead to natural frequencies in the frequency range between 80 and 250 Hz for the entire timing drive [1]. Obviously, engine orders dominating the noise excitation {{are in the same}} frequency range, and resonance effects cannot be avoided. Furthermore, a guarantee is requested that occurring vibration amplitudes do not exceed acceptable limits. Hence, the predicted results of the primary dynamics of the timing drive are key data for the design analysis of a combustion engine. Besides the low frequency range excitation determined by main engine orders, higher-order structure-borne noise excitation is gaining more importance. This is particularly true for chain-driven systems where specic effects lead to considerable excitation of the engine structure in a higher frequency range (typical whine noise). The excitations are caused by the polygon effect, meshing impacts between chain links and sprockets and impacts in the engagement and disengagement between chain, sprockets and guides. This paper presents a comprehensive multi-body dynamics (MBD) model and the relevant simulation environment, which takes into account the entire timing drive as a fully coupled system. While simple MBD models (e. g. <b>longitudinal</b> <b>span</b> representation) are sufcient for the prediction of the primary dynamics of th...|$|E

40|$|Effective {{repair of}} critical-size long bone defects {{presents}} a significant clinical challenge. Electrospun scaffolds can be exploited to deliver protein therapeutics and progenitor cells, but their standalone application for long bone repair {{has not been}} explored. We have previously shown that electrospun composites of amphiphilic poly(d,l-lactic acid) -co-poly(ethylene glycol) -co-poly(d,l-lactic acid) (PELA) and hydroxyapatite (HA) guide the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs), making these scaffolds uniquely suited for evaluating cell-based bone regeneration approaches. Here we examine whether the in vitro bioactivity of these electrospun scaffolds can be exploited for long bone defect repair, either through the participation of exogenous MSCs or through the activation of endogenous cells by a low dose of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (rhBMP- 2). In critical-size rat femoral segmental defects, spiral-wrapped electrospun HA-PELA with preseeded MSCs resulted in laminated endochondral ossification templated by the scaffold across the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>span</b> of the defect. Using GFP labeling, we confirmed that the exogenous MSCs adhered to HA-PELA survived at least 7 days postimplantation, suggesting direct participation of these exogenous cells in templated bone formation. When loaded with 500 ng of rhBMP- 2, HA-PELA spirals led to more robust but less clearly templated bone formation than MSC-bearing scaffolds. Both treatment groups resulted in new bone bridging over {{the majority of the}} defect by 12 weeks. This study is the first demonstration of a standalone bioactive electrospun scaffold for templated bone formation in critical-size long bone defects...|$|E
40|$|The leading face of Saturn's moon Iapetus, Cassini Regio, has an albedo {{only one}} tenth that on its {{trailing}} side. The origin of this enigmatic dichotomy has been debated for over forty years, but with new data, {{a clearer picture}} is emerging. Motivated by Cassini radar and imaging observations, we investigate Soter's model of dark exogenous dust striking an originally brighter Iapetus by modeling {{the dynamics of the}} dark dust from the ring of the exterior retrograde satellite Phoebe under the relevant perturbations. In particular, we study the particles' probabilities of striking Iapetus, as well as their expected spatial distribution on the Iapetian surface. We find that, of the long-lived particles (greater than about 5 microns), most particle sizes (greater than about 10 microns) are virtually certain to strike Iapetus, and their calculated distribution on the surface matches up well with Cassini Regio's extent in its <b>longitudinal</b> <b>span.</b> The satellite's polar regions are observed to be bright, presumably because ice is deposited there. Thus, in the latitudinal direction we estimate polar dust deposition rates to help constrain models of thermal migration invoked to explain the bright poles (Spencer & Denk 2010). We also analyze dust originating from other irregular outer moons, determining that a significant fraction of that material will eventually coat Iapetus [...] perhaps explaining why the spectrum of Iapetus' dark material differs somewhat from that of Phoebe. Finally we track the dust particles that do not strike Iapetus, and find that most land on Titan, with a smaller fraction hitting Hyperion. As has been previously conjectured, such exogenous dust, coupled with Hyperion's chaotic rotation, could produce Hyperion's roughly isotropic, moderate-albedo surface.

40|$|Aim  Spatial {{turnover}} of species, or beta diversity, varies {{in relation to}} geographical distance and environmental conditions, as well as spatial scale. We evaluated the explanatory power of distance, climate and topography on beta diversity of mammalian faunas of North America in relation to latitude. Location  North America north of Mexico. Methods  The study area was divided into 313 equal-area quadrats (241  ×  241  km). Faunal data for all continental mammals were compiled for these quadrats, which were divided among five latitudinal zones. These zones were comparable in terms of latitudinal and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>span,</b> climatic gradients and elevational gradients. We used the natural logarithm of the Jaccard index (ln J) to measure species turnover between pairs of quadrats within each latitudinal zone. The slope of ln J in relation to distance was compared among latitudinal zones. We used partial regression to partition the variance in ln J into the components uniquely explained by distance and by environmental differences, as well as jointly by distance and environmental differences. Results  Mammalian faunas of North America differ more from each other at lower latitudes than at higher latitudes. Regression models of ln J in relation to distance, climatic difference and topographic difference for each zone demonstrated that these variables have high explanatory power that diminishes with latitude. Beta diversity is higher for zones with higher mean annual temperature, lower seasonality of temperature and greater topographic complexity. For each latitudinal zone, distance and environmental differences explain {{a greater proportion of}} the variance in ln J than distance, climate or topography does separately. Main conclusions  The latitudinal gradient in beta diversity of North American mammals corresponds to a macroclimatic gradient of decreasing mean annual temperature and increasing seasonality of temperature from south to north. Most of the variance in spatial turnover is explained by distance and environmental differences jointly rather than distance, climate or topography separately. The high predictive power of geographical distance, climatic conditions and topography on spatial turnover could result from the direct effects of physical limiting factors or from ecological and evolutionary processes that are also influenced by the geographical template...|$|E

After the laboratory testing, the results were analyzed and additional steps were taken to expedite field measurements. To optimize the determination of the distribution of potato tubers in the soil, the program was upgraded to include three-dimensional data acquisition. This allows accurate determination of the horizontal, vertical and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>spans</b> of the distribution of tubers in the soil. Specifically, the program calculates the shape of the tubers, vertical cover of tubers with soil and their minimum distance from the left and right edges of the ridge. The program also locates the center of the tubers, which is a key parameter (along with tuber mass) for determining the area of the tuber cluster. The laboratory testing of the model revealed successful data processing of the program and adequate precision analytics. The testing of the model in the field on Arizona potato variety revealed that the model includes all the data necessary for further processing. Based on the calculated data, it can be assumed with great certainty that the model enables the acquisition of all necessary data and accurately determines the distribution of potato tubers in the soil, ideal shape of the ridge and the minimum necessary depth and distance for the planting of Arizona seed potatoes. </span...|$|R
