He explains: The words in the {{paintings}} are sometimes important to make you start thinking about what {{else is going on}} in there. And a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>times,</b> the words excite me as shapes, and something'll grow out of that. I used to cut these little letters out and glue them on. They just look good all lined up like teeth... sometimes they become the title of the painting.|$|E

25|$|I think I thought I {{could handle}} things. Didn't {{know how to}} shoot music. Music had been {{important}} in my films, it was usually post production. This was tough stuff to shoot. I already had a great respect for people like Minnelli. I just couldn't seem {{to work it out}} without just putting up multiple cameras and shooting an awful lot of film... I later realized or talked to people about this and MGM in the old days everybody was on contract and they would rehearse for weeks. We don't get that. We would stage it and shoot it. We got the songs a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> just a few days before we shoot. We only get the final song. The structural advantage of the old studio system we didn't have. It made a very inefficient shoot. I don't think there was any other way to do it given the circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Dream Chronicles: The Book of Air is {{structured}} much like other three previous {{games in the}} series with some major twists. There are lots of improvements in gameplay overall compared to others. It {{is more of a}} quest-like adventure than a traditional hidden object game, a mixing of adventure and puzzle game. Featuring loads of puzzles and logical quests with different difficulties, The Book of Air still assure that puzzles are well-tricky and tightly blended with the story, which is a typical feature of quest or click-and-point games, such as: putting together parts of broken statues, reconstructing tricky mechanisms, unscrambling messages using the power of Dream Jewels and many more. There are no lists of items to find but a huge amount of inventory based puzzles, logical riddles and quests to solve, which have been scattered through the locations in the game. The objects that players find may be used in a scene other than the one they found it in. Objects will stay in inventory until players need to use them. All objects that players are able to pick up will serve a purpose, whether they are used in that scene or not. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> in this game the pieces players pick up may only be used as they get to the next scene. Some items may not become visible in a scene right away, players must perform other tasks first before they become visible.|$|E

It's sort of an introspective time. A lot of the material lends itself {{to that kind of}} voice and that kind of spirit." ...|$|E

500|$|... 'To me {{the most}} {{important}} thing is the message he says in the beginning of the song,' she notes. 'Weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning.' I felt like a lot of people may not hear that message and a lot of people need to. It wasn't to be preachy. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> people will hear songs that I write that are not the typical songs people look at as 'Mariah Carey songs.' ...|$|E
500|$|Under {{the working}} title [...] "Jellybean", {{the film was}} shot over a span of six weeks in fifty-two locales {{throughout}} the city of Atlanta. Filming {{took place in the}} summer, sometimes in temperatures over a hundred degrees, challenging the cast and crew's ability to stay motivated. [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> we had to motivate each other to say 'listen, up your game. Go hard,'" [...] said Robinson. [...] "And sometimes we needed to step back, take a breath, so we could get through." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{was more}} {{concerned}} that [...] would feel that we did it. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> producers or songwriters leak records because they feel {{if you put the}} song out there it would go [...] Usually a leak that far in advance of an album release puts the song in serious jeopardy of being excluded from the final track list. It was frustrating. I felt like you work hard to get in the studio to work with Beyoncé. [...] I was blessed... that song turned out [...] have nine lives.|$|E

500|$|Timberlake {{decided to}} work with {{director}} Michael Haussman, following his work on Madonna's 1994 music video for [...] "Take a Bow". [...] "It's {{one of my favorite}} videos Madonna's ever done," [...] Timberlake said. [...] "Even today, I still remember the visuals, the images, how he captured her. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>times,</b> Madonna seems like she's the person in control, and in that video, she seemed vulnerable. It was a cool thing to see." [...] The video was first shown on MTV's Making the Video on July 25, 2006.|$|E
500|$|Probably in {{many respects}} most of the songs [...] are [...] But in more of an {{unconscious}} way. I don't really think about telling personal stories when I'm writing music. It just comes. And then a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>times,</b> six months later, eight months later, I go, [...] "Oh, that's what I wrote that song about." [...] But that's when I play the song for lots of people and they all go, 'Oh, I can totally relate to that'. In 'Miles Away' I'm tapping into the global consciousness {{of people who have}} intimacy problems.|$|E
500|$|Peter and I usually write very quickly. It's {{usually a}} day or two a song, but for some reason this didn't really hit us as a hit song. We didn't give up on it. We just kept working on it {{over the course of a}} year. Thank God we did. [...] It was the first song that was cut on the True Blue album. It made me nervous as a writer, because a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> the very first song that gets cut doesn't make it in the long run. But the song ended up making the album, which really opened up a lot of doors for me.|$|E

[...] Consequently, both were often involved in blowing up toilets. In a 1981 Los Angeles Times interview he admitted, [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> when Keith was blowing up toilets I was standing behind him with the matches." [...] In Alabama, Moon and Entwistle loaded a toilet with cherry bombs after being denied room service. According to Entwistle, [...] "That toilet was just dust all over the walls by the time we checked out. The management brought our suitcases down to the gig and said: 'Don't come back...'" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Jon Bernthal is a {{tremendous}} talent and he’s {{got a lot of}} professionalism. A lot of the actors came in to the room as we were starting this season and Bernthal was one of those actors. He was aware {{of a lot of the}} things that were coming up and we talked to him about his character and what we had planned for him this season and he was on board with a lot of it. It was nice being able to run though scenarios with him and get his opinion on how he perceived his character. Because actors, a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>times,</b> think about their characters more than the writers because they’re focused on that single character for months of their lives, if not years. He was all prepared for this." ...|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of the {{recording}} sessions, the band worked on what Bono estimated to be 50 songs; the Edge said they had about 25 songs to choose from, five of which were still very much in a rough state. Bono said that the songwriting process was humbling, as some songs, [...] "you could get them halfway up the hill, three-quarters of the way up the hill. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>times,</b> we just couldn't get them {{up to the top of}} the hill." [...] Speaking about the record's long gestation period, Bono said, [...] "Rumour has it we haven't made a U2 album in the last five years. We have. We've made several. We just didn't release them because we were waiting for something that would be as good as the best we've ever done." ...|$|E

500|$|Fonseca {{was drawn}} to Martinelli's [...] "funky personality", which {{differed}} from her much more serious previous role of Alexandra Udinov on Nikita. Fonseca and Atwell discussed keeping their characters as friends, rather than falling to [...] "jealousy or cattiness. There's nothing but just support and interest and friendship, because a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> it's {{more complicated than that}} on shows." [...] By July 2015, Fonseca was negotiating to return for the second season, and that December she was revealed to be returning for a dream sequence in [...] "A Little Song and Dance". Fazekas said that Angie's appearance in the sequence is her acting as Carter's conscience, [...] "speaking the things that Peggy maybe can’t say to herself. It ties things back together from the first season and it’s connecting all of these things in a way that only a dream can do." ...|$|E
500|$|Graham {{became the}} Browns' uncontested leader, {{but he was}} also [...] "just one of the guys", tackle Mike McCormack said in 1999. [...] "He was not aloof, which you see a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> today." [...] He was good at {{spinning}} and moving in the pocket, skills he learned playing basketball. In his autobiography, Paul Brown praised Graham's ability to anticipate his receivers' route-running by watching their shoulders. [...] "I remember his tremendous peripheral vision and his great athletic skill, as well as his ability to throw a football far and accurately with just a flick of his arm", Brown said. His short passes were hard and accurate, teammates later said, and his long balls were soft. [...] "I used to catch a lot of them one-handed", Lavelli said. [...] "He had great touch in his hands." [...] He was nicknamed [...] "Automatic Otto" [...] for his consistency and toughness.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{intended}} to be released as a mixtape; with tracks linked through interludes and turntable effects, but was then changed to be set up like a film.

You've even got a 'Pause for Porno.' It's got everything that a movie needs." [...] Speaking of how he did not record the album for club or radio play and that he planned the album simply for entertainment with comical aspects throughout, he commented [...] "I'm not trying to send out any messages or anything with this record. I just basically do hard-core hip-hop and try to add a touch of dark comedy here and there. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> the media just takes this and tries to make it into something else when it's all entertainment first. You shouldn't take it too seriously." ...|$|E
