However, there are no standards for representing uncertain information and representations could be easily misleading. Thus, we selected twelve representations that provide different levels of uncertainty information. We compared the representations in an online survey with 90 participants where we asked participants to judge their support in decision-making, familiarity, easiness to understand, and visual appeal. We further evaluated the four most promising representations in a turn-based online game. Players had to make decisions in a farming scenario based on a displayed <b>weather</b> forecast. <b>The</b> results of the survey and the game indicate that a function graph of a probability distribution function {{is the best way}} to communicate uncertain information.

60|$|I {{sank into}} an easy-chair in the coffee-room and, refusing {{to listen to}} Reynold's {{suggestion}} as to the propriety of dining before setting out homewards, ordered a cup of tea.

Jimmy could see the yacht’s anchor light not far away and the yellow blink from her saloon windows, but he could hear nothing that suggested preparations for sending off a boat. As it was cold in the cockpit, he returned to the cabin, where the others had lighted the lamp, and none of them said much for the next hour. They could hear the loose halyards slap the mast and the water splash about beneath the floorings, and the soft lapping of the tide along the planking.|$|E
6000|$|Before she {{had reached}} the end of the first page, her mind was far away again from the unfortunate story. She was {{thinking}} of that [...] "other presentiment," [...] which had formed the subject of her mother's last satirical inquiry. The vague fear that had shaken her when she had accidentally touched the French boy, on her visit to Camp's Hill, still from time to time troubled her memory. Even the event of his death had failed to dissipate the delusion, which associated him with some undefined evil influence that might yet assert itself. A superstitious forewarning of this sort was a weakness new to her in her experience of herself. She was heartily ashamed of it--and yet it kept its hold. Once more the book dropped on her lap. She laid it aside, and walked wearily to the window to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather.</b>|$|E

50|$|The restorers {{say that}} there is no {{evidence}} to even assume that the Nevyansk Tower was purposely built inclined. The current surveying data shows that the defect had to be obvious during the construction. It appears that drifting grounds were to blame for the inclination of the tower from the very beginning. Scientists believe that an uneven subsidence took place when the tower had already been partially built. Most likely, the construction workers stopped building the tower on seeing the defect, but later on they decided to go on with their work. This can be proven by the color of mortar between the bricks, the composition of which changed as the architects worked their way up. It is also visible how the workers started using specially trimmed bricks, with which they tried to even out the tower. It appears that the architects finally succeeded in straightening it out. Current measurements indicate that there is a 3-degree deviation of the base part from the axis, the middle part is already straightened, and the inclination of the tower equals only one degree. The top part of the tower is standing vertically. Local meteorologists say that one can make sure that the top of the tower is absolutely vertical without even using a theodolite by <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> vane on <b>the</b> steeple. It shows the direction of the wind even when the wind is minimal. If the top of the tower were not vertical, <b>the</b> two-meter <b>weather</b> vane weighing 25 kg would always stand still in calm <b>weather</b> in <b>the</b> same position, and this never happens. This explanation ignores the possibility that <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> vane was mounted off-axis from the top of the tower, allowing <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> vane to be straight while the top of the tower is still inclined.|$|R
60|$|While {{these things}} were {{floating}} in his mind, Mrs. Budd and her handsome niece were making preparations for passing the night, aided by Biddy Noon. The old lady was factotum, or factota, {{as it might be}} most classical to call her, though we are entirely without authorities on the subject, and was just as self-complacent and ambitious of seawomanship below decks, as she had been above board. The effect, however, gave Spike great satisfaction, since it kept her out of sight, and left him more at liberty to carry out his own plans. About nine, however, the good woman came on deck, intending to take a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather,</b> like a skilful marineress as she was, before she turned in. Not a little was she astonished at what she then and there beheld, as she whispered to Rose and Biddy, both of whom stuck close to her side, feeling the want of good pilotage, no doubt, in strange waters.|$|E
60|$|Never a day now {{passed that}} {{one or both of}} the birds did not rest on my tent. When I put my head out, like a turtle out of his shell, in the early morning to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather,</b> Killooleet would look down from the {{projecting}} end of the ridgepole and sing good-morning. And when I had been out late on the lake, night-fishing, or following the inlet for beaver, or watching the grassy points for caribou, or just drifting along shore silently to catch the night sounds and smells of the woods, I would listen with childish anticipation for Killooleet's welcome as I approached the landing. He had learned to recognize the sounds of my coming, the rub of a careless paddle, the ripple of water under the bow, or the grating of pebbles on the beach; and with Simmo asleep, and the fire low, it was good to be welcomed back by a cheery little voice in the darkness; for he always sang when he heard me. Sometimes I would try to surprise him; but his sleep was too light and his ears too keen. The canoe would glide up to the old cedar and touch the shore noiselessly; but with the first crunch of gravel under my foot, or the rub of my canoe as I lifted it out, he would waken; and his song, all sweetness and cheer, I'm here, sweet Killooleet-lillooleet-lillooleet, would ripple out of the dark underbrush where his nest was.|$|E
60|$|The happy-go-lucky baby is just able to toddle; and I seldom pull up my curtain in {{the morning}} without seeing him at his window in his yellow flannel night-gown, taking a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather.</b> No matter whether it rains or shines, there he is, smiling and nodding, and looking so merry, that it is evident he has plenty of {{sunshine}} bottled up in his own little heart for private use. I depend on seeing him, and feel {{as if the world}} was not right until this golden little sun rises to shine upon me. He don't seem to have any one to take care of him, but trots about all day, and takes care of himself. Sometimes he is up in the chambers with the girl, while she makes beds, and he helps; then he takes a stroll into the parlour, and spins the gay curtain-tassels to his heart's content; next, he dives into the kitchen (I hope he does not tumble downstairs, but I dare say he wouldn't mind if he did), and he gets pushed about by all the busy women, as they 'fly round.' I rather think it gets too hot for him there about dinner-time; for he often comes out into the yard for a walk at noon, and seems to find endless wonders and delights in the ash barrel, the water-but, two old flower-pots, and a little grass plat, in which he plants a choice variety of articles, in the firm faith they will come up in full bloom. I hope the big spoon and his own red shoe will sprout and appear before any trouble is made about their mysterious disappearance. At night I see a little shadow bobbing about on the curtain, and watch it, till with a parting glimpse at a sleepy face at the window, my small sun sets, and I leave him to his dreams.|$|E
