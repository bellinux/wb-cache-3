40|$|Paty do Alferes is {{a county}} {{located in the}} {{mountain}} region of Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, where olericulture is the main economic activity. The accelerated deforestation of the region, what causes soil erosion, and the excessive fertilizers and agricultural defensives utilization, are bringing degradation and contamination to the environment. Having this in mind, an experiment was conducted in that county aiming to evaluate the grade of heavy metals accumulation in soil and tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill), when using fertilizers and agricultural defensives, cultivated under different soil preparation systems. Run-off plots measuring 22. 0 m x 4. 0 m were installed in Yellow Red Latossol with 30 % slope, each one with a different soil tillage method: (PC) conventional down hill tillage and burning of the residues; (PN) tillage with animal traction following the contour lines with strip cropping grass in 7. 0 m intervals; (CM) minimum tillage. Samples of soils and tomato plants were collected for analysis of heavy metals levels, the respective olericulture productivity and soil fertility. The minimum tillage presented a higher accumulation of heavy metals in soil, mainly when compared to conventional tillage, and Zn content in tillage with animal traction and minimum tillage reached the lowest heavy metals soil content critical limit. Referring to plants, <b>leaf</b> <b>web</b> application of agricultural defensives contributed to increase the accumulation of heavy metals in aerial parts of plants.

The spider uses supporting threads attached to a shrub to suspend its curled-up dry leaf, with the fan-like main web radiating out from the leaf in which the spider hides, with only the tips of its legs visible, feeling for the vibrations of insects colliding with the web. It only goes outside its shelter if prey becomes stuck in the web, or if the web need repair. The spider usually rebuilds its web at night.|$|R
40|$|Several {{species of}} tetranychid mites {{including}} Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae) construct complicated three-dimensional webs on plant leaves. These webs provide protection against biotic and abiotic stress. As producing web {{is likely to}} entail a cost, mites that arrive on a <b>leaf</b> with <b>web</b> are expected to refrain from producing it, because they will gain the benefit of protection from the existing web. Mites that produce less web may then allocate resources that are not spent on web construction to other fitness-enhancing activities, such as laying eggs. To test this, the oviposition rate of T. urticae adult females was examined on leaves with web. As a control, we used leaves where the web had been removed, hence both types of leaves {{had been exposed to}} conspecifics previously and were thus damaged. On leaves with web, the oviposition rate of T. urticae females was higher than on leaves where the web had been removed. Therefore, the presence of web constructed by conspecifics enhanced the oviposition rate of T. urticae females. This provides indirect evidence that mites use the web constructed by conspecifics and thereby save resources that can be allocated to other traits that enhance reproductive succes...|$|R

Our content-link clustering algorithm {{is based on the}} semantic information embedded in hyperlink structures and document contents. HyPursuit admits multiple, coexisting cluster hierarchies based on different principles for grouping documents, such as the Library of Congress catalog scheme and automatically created hypertext clusters. HyPursuit's abstraction functions summarize cluster contents to support scalable query processing. The abstraction functions satisfy system resource limitations with controlled information loss. The result of query processing operations on a cluster summary approximates the result of performing the operations on the entire information space. We constructed a prototype system comprising 100 <b>leaf</b> World Wide <b>Web</b> sites and a hierarchy of 42 servers that route queries to the leaf sites.

40|$|Forested stream {{headwaters}} receive {{little light}} due to heavy shading, so leaves {{falling into the}} stream provide organic matter to fuel the food <b>web.</b> <b>Leaf</b> decomposition is an integrative ecosystem-level process that links abiotic and biotic characteristics. For example, most nutrients leach from the leaves {{within a few days}} of falling into the stream, leaving only cellulose and lignin. Animals cannot digest these compounds so fungi and bacteria breakdown this material, softening the leaves for aquatic insects called shredders. These organisms convert leaves to smaller material which becomes a food source for other organisms. The rate at which leaves decompose in streams and how efficiently the nutrients are cycled will contribute {{to the health of the}} stream. In cobble-bed streams, channel morphology can affect decomposition. Along a single stream segment, surface water enters a down-welling zone and moves into the sediment. This water flows beneath the stream and eventually upwells at a downstream point, bringing warmer and more nitrogen-rich water to the surface. Warmer temperatures and higher nitrogen concentrations can increase leaf decomposition rates. My objective is to compare decomposition rates of leaves in Taneum Creek. I selected six sites that each have a connected upwelling and down-welling zone. Each site has 18 leaf packs which will be sampled six times to calculate the decomposition rate as mass lost versus time. Water chemistry and temperature for each site will also be recorded. I hypothesize that upwelling sites will have faster decomposition rates because of higher nitrogen concentrations and warmer temperatures...|$|R

CIAT genotypes A 344 and A 286 yielded significantly higher than the other genotypes (1140 and 1424 kg/ha, resp.); their superior performance was attributed to their degree of resistance to diseases such as angular leaf spot, CBB, floury <b>leaf</b> spot, and <b>web</b> blight.

40|$|Dennis, P., Young, M. R., Bentley, C. (2001). The {{effects of}} varied grazing {{management}} on epigeal spiders, harvestmen and pseudoscorpions of Nardus stricta grassland in upland Scotland. Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, 86 (1), 39 - 57. A hypothesis that epigeal arachnid assemblages benefit more from greater vegetation structure than botanical species composition in upland grasslands was tested. The test {{was carried out}} within a grazing experiment, initiated in 1991, to investigate vegetation dynamics in response to stocking with mixed livestock at varied rates. The experimental treatments comprised: no livestock, sheep only or sheep with cattle. Livestock treatments were grazed to maintain either 4. 5 or 6. 5 cm average sward heights between tussocks. Two replicates of each treatment were used and allocated to 10 plots across 22 ha of Nardus stricta-dominated grassland. The effects on epigeal arachnids (excluding acarines) of the botanical and structural differences of the grassland between treatments during April?October 1993 and 1994 were assessed. Epigeal arachnid species composition was estimated using continuous pitfall trapping and the densities of mainly money spiders (Araneae: Linyphiidae) were estimated from monthly suction sampling and visual counts of spider webs in micro-habitats. These data were later compared with stocking rate, botanical species composition and vegetation structure. Forty of the 84 sampled species occurred in all experimental treatments. There was a significant effect of treatment {{on the number of}} arachnid species in suction but not in pitfall samples. There was also a significant effect of treatment on the relative abundance of 26 % of these arachnid species. For most species of spider, harvestmen and pseudoscorpion, abundance was greater in the ungrazed and taller, grazed swards although a few species were captured in greater numbers in the treatments with shorter swards. Botanical composition, mean vegetation height and grazing intensity accounted for 48. 5 ? 53. 2 % of the variability in the species composition/relative abundance of these arachnids, calculated by direct gradient analysis. Almost half of the species were randomly distributed across the experimental treatments and are recorded as widespread in upland heathland or grassland habitats and lowland grassland. More spider webs were counted during July?September 1993 ? 1994, with greater numbers (dominated by the linyphiid species, Lepthyphantes mengii) counted in tall, ungrazed swards compared with taller grazed swards created by sheep alone or sheep with cattle. In the treatments with fewer webs, these were occupied by more linyphiid species. Suction sampling detected greater diversity of arachnids in the ungrazed N. stricta. This was related to increased plant litter below the <b>leaf</b> stratum where <b>webs</b> were counted. Vegetation structure and not botanical species composition within the N. stricta plant community determined arachnid species composition and abundance. Furthermore, no single grazing treatment supported the total number of arachnid species represented across the entire grazing experiment. It is concluded that varied grazing management, including some temporary ungrazed areas, is necessary to maintain the structural variability of grassland patches so as to maintain a spatial mosaic that favours the optimum arachnid fauna of upland grasslands.
