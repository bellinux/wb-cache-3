50|$|<b>Long-term</b> <b>goals</b> {{are used}} to create a mental image of your end result of the goal. They may {{ultimately}} be harder to narrow down to specifics of path and deadlines. Categories like career goals, educational pursuits, or long-term financial planning often fall victim to external factors that can alter outcomes. Keeping the big picture in mind can help maintain value and motivation in pursuit of the <b>long-term</b> <b>goals.</b> While the <b>long-term</b> <b>goals</b> often hold the value for the pursuant, breaking them down into smaller more obtainable goals with a specific time frame can make them more effective (MindTools.com, 1996). The process of breaking down of <b>long-term</b> <b>goals</b> into realistic, short-term accomplishments can help build self-esteem, offer instant feedback, and provide check points to the individual to keep them on task (Training Journal, 2011, p. 55-58).|$|R
5|$|Kagame and Rwigyema {{joined the}} NRA {{primarily}} to ease conditions for Rwandan refugees persecuted by Obote. They {{also had a}} <b>long-term</b> <b>goal</b> of returning with other Tutsi refugees to Rwanda; military experience {{would enable them to}} fight the Hutu-dominated Rwandan army. In the NRA, Kagame specialized in intelligence-gathering, and he rose to a position close to Museveni's. The NRA, based in the Luwero Triangle, fought the Ugandan army for the next five years, even after Obote was deposed in a 1985 coup d'état and the start of peace talks.|$|E
5|$|Originally, three parties {{owned the}} {{stocks in the}} stock company, Peab who owned 50% of the stocks, Malmö FF who owned 25%, and Erling Pålsson Teknik & Fastighets AB who owned the {{remaining}} 25%. Malmö FF early expressed their desire to buy the stocks of Peab and Erling Pålsson to reduce rent on the stadium and increase profits. On 27 April 2012, {{it was announced that}} Malmö FF were close to buying the full 25% of stocks owned by Erling Pålsson and 25% of the stocks owned by Peab, increasing their own share to 75% and leaving Peab with a 25% share. On 1 May 2012, Malmö Stad granted the bailment needed for Malmö FF to buy the stocks. The deal, worth 90 million kronor, was finalised on 13 June 2012. The <b>long-term</b> <b>goal</b> for Malmö FF is to buy the remaining 25% of the stocks to fully own Swedbank Stadion.|$|E
5|$|Some of the conquered territories were {{immediately}} incorporated into Germany {{as part of}} Hitler's <b>long-term</b> <b>goal</b> of creating a Greater Germanic Reich. Several areas, such as Alsace-Lorraine, were placed {{under the authority of}} an adjacent Gau (regional district). Beyond the territories incorporated into Germany were the Reichskommissariate (Reich Commissariats), quasi-colonial regimes established in a number of occupied countries. Areas placed under German administration included the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, Reichskommissariat Ostland (encompassing the Baltic states and Belarus) and Reichskommissariat Ukraine. Conquered areas of Belgium and France were placed under control of the Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France. Belgian Eupen-Malmedy, which had been part of German until 1919, was annexed directly. Part of Poland was immediately incorporated into the Reich, and the General Government was established in occupied central Poland. Hitler intended to eventually incorporate many of these areas into the Reich.|$|E

From the moment of formation, Airbus had begun studies into derivatives of the Airbus A300B {{in support of this}} <b>long-term</b> <b>goal.</b> Prior to the service introduction of the first Airbus airliners, engineers within Airbus had identified nine possible variations of the A300 known as A300B1 to B9. A 10th variation, conceived in 1973, later the first to be constructed, was designated the A300B10. It was a smaller aircraft which would be developed into the long-range Airbus A310. Airbus then focused its efforts on the single-aisle market, which was dominated by the 737 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9.|$|E
