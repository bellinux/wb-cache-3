40|$|The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC) and National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) are collaborating {{to provide}} {{national}} leadership to improve external-cause-of-injury-coded (E-coded) data collected in state administrative data systems. These data are {{used at the}} national, state, and local levels to identify high-risk populations, set priorities, and plan and evaluate injury prevention programs and policies, and are potentially useful for evaluating emergency medical services (EMS) and trauma care systems. The initial steps in this effort have been to develop strategies and action plans based on recommendations from public and private partners {{in the field of}} injury prevention and control. In the summer of 2007, CDC assembled an expert workgroup to prepare a Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) Recommendations and Reports that identified strategies for improving E-coding in state morbidity data systems. This MMWR report, published in March 2008 ([URL] summarized: (1) the status of E-coding in state data systems; (2) the need to improve E-coding in state data systems; (3) the uses of these data for prevention efforts; and (4) key strategies recommended as next steps. In August 2008, CDC brought together 30 representatives from 21 federal agencies that rely on E-coded data for program planning and evaluation. These federal partners expressed their support and willingness to work together to improve E-coding in state morbidity data systems as well as in their federal agency's data systems. On February 22 - 23, 2009, CDC held the E-coding Improvement Partners Meeting in Maryland, with a broader range of stakeholders to seek recommendations for action plans to address the strategies published in the MMWR report. Meeting participants included representatives from federal and state agencies, medical and public health professional organizations, non-profit injury prevention and health/safety promotion organizations, and health insurance plan organizations. This report summarizes potential collaborative action steps for CDC and its partners to improve E-coding in state morbidity data systems, with implications for improving federal morbidity data systems, based on recommendations by participants of that February 2009 meeting.

40|$|A {{new set of}} {{measurements}} of the anisotropic reflectance factor of the snow surface on the high Antarctic Plateau will be used with the DISORT and ATRAD radiation models {{to learn about the}} combined effects of clouds, atmospheric gases and the snow surface on the solar radiation budget of the East Antarctic Plateau. From the new data, a parameterization will be developed so that a relatively simple function will predict the anisotropic reflectance factor of the snow for a given set of viewing angles, solar zenith angle, and wavelength. DISORT will be used, along with the new data, to model the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) {{at the top of the}} atmosphere. This modeling will be compared with satellite observations and will help to explain those observations. The effect of clouds on the BRDF at the top of the atmosphere will be investigated. It has been observed that clouds reduce the nadir reflectance over snow and increase the forward-scattering peak, despite the fact that cloud particles should be less forwardscattering than snow grains. A modeling investigation will try to explain the processes behind this effect. Shortwave cloud radiative forcing at the surface and the top of the atmosphere over the Antarctic Plateau will be estimated using the ATRAD model and measurements made at Dome C and South Pole. These estimates will be compared with previous estimates made from both surface and satellite data. Finally, the effects of carbon dioxide, ozone, and water vapor, atmospheric gases that absorb solar radiation, on the solar radiation budget will be investigated. Their effect on the planetary albedo over Antarctica will be modeled and the effects of the enhanced absorption by these gases due to the high surface albedo will be studied. 2 Table 1.

Steering Committee (USSC) encourages interested U. S. scientists to apply {{for participation in the}} inaugural projects of the ANDRILL Program. ANDRILL (ANtarctic DRILLing) is a multinational, multidisciplinary program investigating Antarctica’s role in Cenozoic-Recent global environmental change. ANDRILL’s integrated science approach will use stratigraphic drilling and multi-proxy core analysis combined with geophysical surveys and numerical modeling to address: 1) the Cenozoic history of Antarctic climate and ice sheets; 2) the evolution of polar biota; 3) Antarctic tectonism; and 4) Antarctica’s role in the evolution of Earth’s ocean-climate system. Nations contributing funds to the currently supported ANDRILL projects include Germany (GER), Italy (IT), New Zealand (NZ), and the United States (U. S.). U. S. Support for ANDRILL is being provided by the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Office of Polar Programs (OPP).

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{availability of}} electronic corpora means {{that every year}} more and more new people enter the field of corpus linguistics. I think it is especially these people that can benefit from the Glossary of corpus linguistics, compiled by three prominent corpus linguists from the University of Lancaster. This is not to say, of course, that the entries would not be helpful even for more advanced corpus linguists. The book contains nearly 500 entries, organized alphabetically, and a separate <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>acronyms</b> <b>used</b> in corpus linguistics. The entries are short, rarely exceeding 100 words, and this means, of course, that the information is not exhaustive. References to further sources of information are available for some, but not all entries. Website addresses have only been given for “some organisations, groups, corpora or software where {{we feel that the}} site is unlikely to close down or move ” (p. 1). The authors have not expressed their principles for the inclusion of topics, but the blurb on the back cover lists six areas of focus: (1) important corpora, (2) key technical terms, (3) key linguistic terms relevant to corpus-based research, (4) key statistical measures used in corpus linguistics, (5) key computer programme/retrieval systems used in the construction and exploitation of corpora, and (6) standards applied within the field of corpus linguistics. This list illustrates the challenge the compilers must have faced during their project. Apart from the self-evident issues, such as major corpora and the technical terminology of the field, they have had to include terms from linguistics, statistics, and computer science. Drawing borderlines cannot have been easy.
