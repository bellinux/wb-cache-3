5|$|Despite city {{efforts at}} {{large-scale}} revitalization, {{by the beginning}} of the 21st century the downtown area consisted <b>largely</b> <b>of</b> the coal export facilities, the shipyard, and municipal offices.

5|$|Scattered objects, {{like other}} trans-Neptunian objects, have low densities and are {{composed}} <b>largely</b> <b>of</b> frozen volatiles {{such as water}} and methane. Spectral analysis of selected Kuiper belt and scattered objects has revealed signatures of similar compounds. Both Pluto and Eris, for instance, show signatures for methane.|$|E

5|$|The Shrines of Ise {{have been}} celebrated as the {{prototype}} of Japanese architecture. <b>Largely</b> <b>of</b> wood, traditional housing and many temple buildings see the use of tatami mats and sliding doors that break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor space. Japanese sculpture, <b>largely</b> <b>of</b> wood, and Japanese painting are among {{the oldest of the}} Japanese arts, with early figurative paintings dating back to at least 300 BC. The history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native Japanese aesthetics and adaptation of imported ideas.|$|E
5|$|The {{eastern half}} of the {{watershed}} is more open and rural than the urban western half, which consists <b>largely</b> <b>of</b> residential areas with pockets of commerce and industry. An estimated 180,000people lived in the watershed as of 2012.|$|E

50|$|First {{generation}} {{computers were}} <b>largely</b> out <b>of</b> reach {{of schools and}} hobbyists who wished to build their own, <b>largely</b> because <b>of</b> {{the cost of the}} large number of vacuum tubes required (though relay-based computer projects were undertaken). The fourth generation (VLSI) was also <b>largely</b> out <b>of</b> reach, too, due to most of the design work being inside the integrated circuit package (though this barrier, too, was later removed). So, second and third generation computer design (transistors and SSI) were perhaps the best suited to being undertaken by schools and hobbyists.|$|R

5|$|A 1663 will by Richard Harvey of Exeter {{established}} Almshouses {{which became}} Harvey's Hospital. These were rebuilt in 1870 <b>largely</b> <b>of</b> stone from previous building. In 1685 Chard {{was one of}} the towns in which Judge Jeffreys held some of the Bloody Assizes after the failure of the Monmouth Rebellion in which 160 men from Chard joined the forces of the Duke of Monmouth. The subsequent hangings took place on Snowden Hill {{to the west of the}} town. As elsewhere in this area, the 'finger-post' road-sign at this spot is painted red and is known as 'Red Post' to commemorate the executions.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{a symbol}} of the Punic-Phoenician goddess Tanit, all {{pavement}} motifs are typically Hellenistic Greek in origin, although some pavement mortars used with tesserae designs betray some Italian influence. Although the three major ethnic groups of Delos included Greeks (<b>largely</b> <b>of</b> Athenian origin), Syrians/Phoenicians, and Italians/Romans, it is very likely that many of these Italians were Italiotes, Greek-speaking natives of Magna Graecia in what is now southern Italy. Delian inhabitants of either Greek, Italian, and Syrian origins owned mosaics in their private households, but Vincent J. Bruno asserts that the designs of their mosaic artworks were indebted entirely to Greek artistic traditions.|$|E
5|$|Biologically active {{mushroom}} polysaccharides {{have been}} a frequent research topic in recent decades due to their possible stimulatory effect on innate and cell-mediated immune responses, antitumor activities, and other activities. Immunostimulatory activity, antioxidant activity, cholesterol-lowering, and blood sugar-lowering effects have been detected in extracts of R.virescens fruit bodies, which are attributed to polysaccharides. A water-insoluble beta-glucan, RVS3-II, has been isolated from the fruit bodies. Sulfated derivatives of this compound have antitumor activities against sarcoma tumor cell lines. RVP, a water-soluble polysaccharide present in the mushroom, is made <b>largely</b> <b>of</b> galactomannan subunits and has antioxidant activity.|$|E

5|$|Cheap at Half the Price was {{recorded}} by Frith {{at his home}} in New York City on a 4-track machine. He played all the instruments himself, with the exception of bass guitar on two tracks, and drums, for which he used tapes and samples previously recorded by other drummers. The record differed from Frith's previous experimental albums in that it consisted <b>largely</b> <b>of</b> pop-like songs, and he sang for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Clowes {{assigned}} the inexperienced 7th Infantry Brigade a defensive role, guarding key points around Milne Bay from seaborne or airborne attack, {{and kept the}} veteran 18th Infantry Brigade in reserve, ready to counterattack. Lacking accurate maps and finding that their signals equipment was unreliable in the conditions, the Australian command and control system consisted <b>largely</b> <b>of</b> cable telephones, or where {{there was not enough}} line available, runners. The soft ground made movement by road and even on foot difficult.|$|E
5|$|Comets {{are small}} Solar System bodies, {{typically}} {{only a few}} kilometres across, composed <b>largely</b> <b>of</b> volatile ices. They have highly eccentric orbits, generally a perihelion within the orbits of the inner planets and an aphelion far beyond Pluto. When a comet enters the inner Solar System, its proximity to the Sun causes its icy surface to sublimate and ionise, creating a coma: a long tail {{of gas and dust}} often visible to the naked eye.|$|E

5|$|For 50 years, DuMont was {{the only}} major {{broadcast}} television network to cease operations, until CBS Corporation and Time Warner shut down two other struggling networks, UPN and The WB, in September 2006 to create The CW Television Network – whose schedule was originally composed <b>largely</b> <b>of</b> programs from both of its predecessor networks.|$|E
5|$|In 1827, the Unitarians were {{challenged}} by Federalist forces. After {{the resignation of}} Rivadavia, Manuel Dorrego was installed as governor of Buenos Aires province. He quickly made peace with Brazil but, on returning to Argentina, was overthrown and executed by the Unitarian general Juan Lavalle, who took Dorrego's place. However, Lavalle did not spend long as governor either: he was soon overthrown by militias composed <b>largely</b> <b>of</b> gauchos led by Rosas and Estanislao López. By the end of 1829 the old legislature that Lavalle had disbanded was back in place and had appointed Rosas as governor of Buenos Aires.|$|E

Phenolic compounds—common in fruits and vegetables—are being scientifically investigated for their potential health benefits associated with reduced risk of chronic and degenerative diseases.|$|E
5|$|In the First World War, firing and {{observation}} positions were hand-painted in disruptive patterns by artists known as camoufleurs, and they sometimes varied their patterns seasonally. Uniforms were <b>largely</b> <b>of</b> a single colour, {{such as the}} British khaki; but snow camouflage clothes came into use in some armies by 1917. For example, Austro-Hungarian troops on the Italian front used skis and wore snow camouflage smocks and overtrousers over their uniforms, and improvised white cloths over their uniform caps.|$|E
