5000|$|<b>Lacinato</b> <b>kale</b> {{dates to}} the 18th century in Italy. This {{cultivar}} is popular among gardeners because of its color and texture, and was listed amongst the plants Thomas Jefferson recorded in his 1777 garden at Monticello. The plant grows to a height of two feet, with blistered leaves often over one foot in length each and two to four inches wide. [...] The [...] "straplike" [...] leaves are typically harvested {{from the bottom of}} the stem, leaving the remainder of the plant resembling a palm tree.|$|E
40|$|AbstractKale is a nutrient-dense, dark-green leafy {{vegetable}} often eaten raw in salads or added to smoothies. The USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference Release 26 reports the weight for one cup raw, chopped kale as 67 grams, {{among the highest}} for raw {{leafy vegetable}}s. Objectives: Measure the weight of one cup moderately packed raw kale with stems and tough midrib parts removed and evaluate {{the impact of the}} new cup weight on nutrient intake of individuals consumingraw kale. Methods: Six staff members measured curly and <b>lacinato</b> <b>kale</b> using standard procedures and 14 study participantsconsuming 4 - 6 cups raw leafy vegetables/day measured one cup curly kale in their usual manner. Twenty-seven dietary recalls obtained from participants following the Wahls™ diet were entered intothe Nutrition Data System for Research and then recalculated using staff-measured curly kale cup weight. Results: Mean(SE) staff cup weight for <b>lacinato</b> <b>kale</b> was significantly higher than curly kale [21. 3 (1. 4) g vs 16. 0 (1. 4) g; p< 0. 0001]. Percent refuse was also higher for <b>lacinato</b> <b>kale</b> [mean(SD) 42. 0 (11. 4) % vs 28. 5 (3. 9) %; p= 0. 012]. Mean(SD) weight of moderately packed participant-measured cups [17. 5 (6. 4) g]was similar to staff cup weightbutfirmly packed participant cupsweighed more [46. 4 (4. 1) g]. Intake of vitamins K, C, A, manganese, copper, and folatewere significantly lower for diets calculated with the staff cup weight (p< 0. 0001). Conclusions: The new measured cup weight of raw kale is lower than previously reportedand reduces nutrient levels in diets containing raw kale. Verification of cup weights for other raw leafy vegetables may be warranted...|$|E
40|$|What is communicated when a {{neighbor}} raises raspberries instead of roses {{on the porch}} trellis, grows <b>lacinato</b> <b>kale</b> rather than creeping bentgrass in the front yard, or keeps Buckeye hens rather than a bulldog? This essay asserts that these and other urban agricultural practices are expensive—that they are not just ends in themselves but are commutative acts. These acts are intended to educate neighbors, assert a viewpoint, establish identity, and area widely viewed as symbols of support for a social and political movement—what Michael Pollan has dubbed the “Food Movement. ” And, as symbolic acts, they deserve protection under the First Amendment. This article will first examine {{the recognition of the}} Food Movement as a social and political movement. It will then look at how gardens and other urban homesteading practices, like raising chickens and bees, are broadly asserted and accepted as symbols of the Food Movement. Finally, it will assess how First Amendment principles will apply to these urban agricultural practices and the degree of constitutional protection they should receive...|$|E
