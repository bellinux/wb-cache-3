50|$|Early second {{generation}} cephalosporins {{are very similar}} in basic structure to the first generation. <b>Loracarbef</b> however {{does not have the}} normal dihydrothiazin ring but is a carbacephem that has a carbon atom in the ring instead of a sulfur atom making it a tetrahydropyridine ring. This chemical property gives <b>Loracarbef</b> better stability in plasma while retaining oral absorption characteristics and affinity for binding to PBP. The 7-phenyl-glycine makes it orally available and the chlorine at position C-3 makes it as active as Cefaclor. An important structural change in the development of {{second generation}} cephalosporins was the introduction of an α-iminomethoxy group to the C-7 side chain. This gave an increased resistance to β-lactamases due to stereochemical blocking of the beta-lactam ring. Cefuroxime was the first cephalosporin to incorporate this side chain. Another very important group in the second generation is the aminothiazole ring to the C-3 side chain. This development drastically increased binding affinity to PBP and increased antimicrobial activity. The aminothiazole ring {{can be seen in the}} structure of Cefotiam.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{discuss the}} in vitro activity, pharmacokinetics, {{clinical}} efficacy, adverse effects, and relative merits of <b>loracarbef,</b> a new orally administered carbacephem antibiotic. DATA SOURCF. 8 : Pertinent literature was identified by {{a review of}} selected journals and a MEDLINE search. Additional information {{was provided by the}} manufacturer of <b>loracarbef.</b> STUDY SELECTION: All studies that have evaluated the clinical efficacy of <b>loracarbef</b> were included. In vitro studies were included if they used similar methodologies. Additional information was incorporated regarding the chemistry, pharmacokinetics, and adverse effects of <b>loracarbef.</b> DATA SYNTHF. 8 IS: <b>Loracarbef</b> has antibacterial activity against most community-acquired respiratory tract, skin and skin structure, and urinary tract pathogens. The drug is well absorbed after oral administration and plasma concentrations achieved in patients are greater than the in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations for most of the above bacteria. Although the majority of the clinical studies with <b>loracarbef</b> have methodologic deficiencies, <b>loracarbef</b> therapy has demonstrated similar efficacy in the treatment of upper respiratory tract (except otitis media), lower respiratory tract, skin and skin-structure, and urinary tract infections compared with accepted antibiotics. Potential advantages of the new carbacephem may be improved patient compliance with its less frequent dosing schedule (once or twice a day, depending on the infection), and a low incidence of adverse effects. coxct. usrosstPreliminary data indicate that <b>loracarbef</b> may be an alternative agent for the treatment of a variety of community-acquired infections. Additional clinical experience and rigorously controlled comparative clinical trials are necessary to enable practitioners to fully define the therapeutic role of <b>loracarbef...</b>|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} whether pre-exposure of bacteria to a subinhibitory concentration (sub-MIC) of <b>loracarbef</b> (LY 163892) or daptomycin (LY 146032) could modify bacterial susceptibility to serum bactericidal activity and to phagocytosis and killing by murine peritoneal macrophages and by human polymorphonuclear leucocytes. Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae type b and Staphylococcus aureus grown in the presence of one quarter the MIC of <b>loracarbef,</b> and S. aureus exposed to one quarter the MIC of daptomycin were phagocytosed and killed in numbers significantly higher than non-exposed bacteria. Pre-exposure to <b>loracarbef</b> resulted in increased susceptibility of E. coli and H. influenzae type b to the bactericidal activity of antiserum, but exposure to <b>loracarbef</b> or daptomycin did not modify serum sensitivity of S. aureus. <b>Loracarbef</b> treatment and antiserum enhanced phagocytosis and killing of E. coli and H. influenzae type b to a greater extent than either antibiotic treatment or antiserum alone.

40|$|In a {{randomized}} crossover trial, six volunteers received 200 - and 400 -mg doses of <b>loracarbef</b> (LY 163892), a new oral cephalosporin. Mean +/- standard error {{of the mean}} concentrations in serum obtained after 1. 5 and 3 h were 13. 2 +/- 2. 8 and 4. 3 +/- 0. 7 mg/liter, respectively, after the 400 -mg dose and 6. 9 +/- 1. 0 and 1. 7 +/- 0. 2 mg/liter, respectively, after the 200 -mg dose. Bactericidal reciprocal titers measured against respiratory pathogens in serum suggested that <b>loracarbef</b> would be highly effective against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes (median titers, 8 to 128 at 1. 5 h and less than 2 to 32 at 3 h) and beta-lactamase-negative Haemophilus influenzae (median titers, 4 at 1. 5 h and 2 to 4 at 3 h). Other species (Branhamella catarrhalis, Streptococcus anginosus, Staphylococcus aureus) were associated with lower bactericidal titers. Killing curves performed against 12 strains demonstrated that the bioactivity of <b>loracarbef</b> (measured by {{the reduction in the}} area under the control growth curve) was significantly correlated with the concentration/MIC ratio, whereas the initial rate of killing was not, once the concentration was greater than the MIC. Our results suggest that administration of 400 mg of <b>loracarbef</b> every 8 h might be associated with more favorable pharmacodynamic parameters against target bacteria...|$|E
40|$|One hundred five {{infants and}} {{children}} with acute otitis media were randomized to therapy with <b>loracarbef,</b> an experimental carbacephem antibiotic, or amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin), an approved drug for this disease. Ninety-two were evaluable (46 in each group). Middle ear fluid samples obtained for culture before therapy grew Haemophilus spp. in 30 % of cases, pneumococci in 29 % of cases, and Moraxella catarrhalis in 15 % of cases. beta-Lactamase-producing bacteria were found in 37 % of patients. Clinical failure occurred in four loracarbef-treated patients and one amoxicillin-clavulanate-treated patient (P = 0. 361). Recurrence of acute otitis media was {{more common in the}} 2 to 3 weeks after <b>loracarbef</b> treatment (eight patients) than it was after amoxicillin-clavulanate therapy (three patients), but not significantly so (P = 0. 197). Thus, combined failure and recurrence occurred in 12 loracarbef-treated patients and four amoxicillin-clavulanate-treated patients (P = 0. 052). Gastrointestinal side effects occurred in 13 loracarbef-treated and 21 amoxicillin-clavulanate-treated patients (P = 0. 13). Diaper rash was more common with amoxicillin-clavulanate (22 patients) than with <b>loracarbef</b> (10 patients; P = 0. 016).

40|$|Three {{members of}} the tribe Proteeae (Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, and Providencia stuartii) were tested against five newer orally {{administered}} cephalosporins (cefdinir, cefprozil, cefuroxime, cefetamet, and <b>loracarbef)</b> by the disk diffusion and reference broth microdilution methods. One hundred strains of these organisms were tested to confirm the excessive interpretive error rates that previously had been noted for the disk diffusion test. The {{results indicate that the}} suggested disk diffusion breakpoints for cefetamet and cefuroxime were without serious interpretive errors. In contrast, <b>loracarbef,</b> cefdinir, and cefprozil results exceeded acceptable interpretive error rates, with very major (false-susceptible) errors of 4, 5, and 9 % respectively. <b>Loracarbef</b> currently has a warning in the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards table footnotes addressing this problem. We recommend including cefdinir and cefprozil in the list of compounds requiring this warning. In addition, MICs of cefazolin, cefaclor, and cephalothin were determined to establish whether a class MIC concept to predict susceptibility for these agents was possible.

40|$|Susceptibility {{testing of}} Haemophilus species and Moraxella catarrhalis is medium and {{inoculum}} dependent. Seven oral agents, ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefaclor, <b>loracarbef,</b> cefuroxime-axetil, cefixime, and erythromycin, were tested against 400 beta-lactamase-positive and -negative clinically significant respiratory strains of Haemophilus species and 100 strains of M. catarrhalis. Sources of the strains included teaching and regional hospitals {{and a private}} laboratory. All strains were tested by broth microdilution and disk diffusion in haemophilus test medium for Haemophilus species and Mueller-Hinton broth and agar for M. catarrhalis. Appropriate National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) standards were followed. For Haemophilus species, by disk diffusion and broth microdilution, respectively, 27 and 27 % of strains were resistant to ampicillin, 37 and 5 % were resistant to erythromycin, 3 and 0. 5 % were resistant to cefaclor, 2 and 0. 5 % were resistant to <b>loracarbef,</b> and 0 % were resistant to cefuroxime-axetil, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. beta-Lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant strains were not observed. Of M. catarrhalis strains, 56 % were resistant to ampicillin by disk diffusion and 95 % were resistant by broth microdilution. This species was susceptible to all other agents tested by either method. The disagreements between disk diffusion results and MICs for cefaclor, ampicillin, cefuroxime, and <b>loracarbef</b> that occurred with use of the 1990 NCCLS tables were resolved when the 1992 NCCLS tables were used...|$|E
40|$|Sputum and serum {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>loracarbef</b> (LY 163892) {{were performed}} in 19 patients with purulent bronchiectasis.

40|$|An {{intestinal}} proton-dependent peptide transporter {{located on}} the lumenal surface of the enterocyte {{is responsible for the}} uptake of many orally absorbed beta-lactam antibiotics. Both cephalexin and <b>loracarbef</b> are transported by this mechanism into the human intestinal Caco- 2 cell line. Forty-seven analogs of the carbacephalosporin <b>loracarbef</b> and the cephalosporin cephalexin were prepared to evaluate the structural features necessary for uptake by this transport carrier. Compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activities and for their ability to inhibit 1 mM cephalexin uptake and, subsequently, uptake into Caco- 2 cells. Three clinically evaluated orally absorbed carbacephems were taken up by Caco- 2 cells, consistent with their excellent bioavailability in humans. Although the carrier preferred the L stereoisomer, these compounds lacked antibacterial activity and were hydrolyzed intracellularly in Caco- 2 cells. Compounds modified at the 3 position of cephalexin and <b>loracarbef</b> with a cyclopropyl or a trifluoromethyl group inhibited cephalexin uptake. Analogs with lipophilic groups on the primary amine of the side chain inhibited cephalexin uptake, retained activity against gram-positive bacteria but lost activity against gram-negative bacteria. Substitution of the phenylglycl side chain with phenylacetyl side chains gave similar results. Compounds which lacked an aromatic ring in the side chain inhibited cephalexin uptake but lost all antibacterial activity. Thus, the phenylglycl side chain is not absolutely required for uptake. Different structural features are required for antibacterial activity and for being a substrate of the transporter. Competition studies with cephalexin indicate that human intestinal Caco- 2 cells may be a useful model system for initially guiding structure-activity relationships for the rational design of new oral agents...|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} the bactericidal activities of penicillin, cefprozil, cefixime, cefaclor, and <b>loracarbef</b> against three clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae which were susceptible, moderately susceptible, and resistant to penicillin. An in vitro two-compartment glass infection model {{was used to}} simulate human pharmacokinetics {{in the presence of}} bacteria. Also, changes in organism susceptibility and development of resistant subpopulations were evaluated. Simulated pediatric dosage regimens and target peak concentrations in the central compartment were as follows: penicillin V-potassium, 26 mg/kg of body weight every 6 h (q 6 h) and 14 micrograms/ml; cefaclor, 13. 4 mg/kg q 8 h and 16 micrograms/ml; <b>loracarbef,</b> 15 mg/kg q 12 h and 19 micrograms/ml; cefprozil, 15 mg/kg q 12 h and 11 micrograms/ml; and cefixime, 8 mg/kg q 24 h and 4 micrograms/ml. Targeted half-lives of each agent were 1 h for penicillin, cefaclor, and loracarbef; 1. 3 h for cefprozil; and 3. 5 h for cefixime. Growth controls were performed at two different pump rates, 0. 8 and 2. 0 ml/min (half-lives = 3. 5 and 1 h, respectively). Each isolate demonstrated autolysis at the lower rate which was attributed to a decreased supply of fresh nutrients available to the organisms in the infection compartment. Against the susceptible isolate, the time to 99. 9 % killing was statistically significant between penicillin V-potassium and both cefaclor and cefixime (P < 0. 029). <b>Loracarbef</b> never achieved a 99. 9 % reduction in the inoculum. At 48 h penicillin, cefprozil, and cefaclor were equivalent in extent of killing. Against the intermediately resistant isolate, cefprozil was superior to all other regimens with respect to rate of killing (P < 0. 013) and extent of killing at 24 h (P < 0. 0003). At 48 h penicillin, cefprozil, and cefaclor were equivalent in extent of killing. All of the regimens exhibited inferior activity against this penicillin-resistant isolate. A 99. 9 % kill was never obtained with any of the regimens, nor was there an appreciable decrease in the colony counts. In conclusion, it appears that cefprozil, penicillin, and cefaclor are effective therapies against sensitive and even intermediately sensitive isolates of S. pneumoniae. However, none of the oral therapies appear to be of any benefit against penicillin-resistant isolates. The in vitro model may be an effective tool in evaluating other multiple-dose therapies against this fastidious organism, since the continual supply of fresh medium maintains the viability of S. pneumoniae with minimal stationary-phase autolysis...|$|E
40|$|Many oral {{penicillins}} and cephalosporins {{are used}} to treat clinical infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Therefore, using different beta-lactams as selectors, we estimated the frequencies of one-step mutations leading to resistance. Resistant mutants were obtained from penicillin-susceptible, intermediately resistant, and penicillin resistant strains. For cefixime, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone, the frequencies of mutation ranged from 10 (- 6) to 10 (- 8) when resistant mutants were selected at 2 - to 8 -fold the MIC, and the MICs increased 2 - to 16 -fold. For ampicillin, ampicillin-sulbactam, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefaclor, and <b>loracarbef,</b> the frequencies of mutation were about 10 (- 7) to 10 (- 8), and the MICs increased twofold at most. One to three resistance profiles of the resulting mutants were selected {{for each of the}} selecting antibiotics. Among those, some showed resistance to the cephalosporins associated with a 2 - to 32 -fold increase in susceptibility to the penicillins. Competition experiments showed a decreased affinity of PBP 2 x for cefpodoxime in all mutants. In some mutants that were more susceptible to amoxicillin, a decreased affinity of PBP 2 x for cefpodoxime was associated with an increased affinity for amoxicillin and a particular substitution of alanine for threonine at position 550 just after the KSG triad. From these results we infer (i) that among the beta-lactams tested the penicillins, cefaclor, and <b>loracarbef</b> selected one-step resistant mutants less frequently and that they achieved a lower level of resistance, and (ii) that mutants with different profiles may have acquired different point mutations in PBP 2 x...|$|E
40|$|In acute pharyngotonsillitis group A streptococci (GAS) is the {{etiological}} {{agent in}} 30 - 50 % of cases. Phenoxymethylpenicillin (pcV) is the {{drug of choice}} in Sweden. However, the failure rate {{is as high as}} 5 - 25 % and further pcV treatment is followed by still higher failure rates. The background of failures remains largely elusive. The aim of the studies was: 1 To investigate the short- and long-term efficacy of pcV versus clindamycin in patients with GAS pharyngotonsillitis who failed on pcV treatment. 2 To examine failure and non-failure strains considering so called penicillin-tolerance. 3 To compare the DNA-profiles of failure and non-failure strains. 4 To evaluate the kinetics of pcV, <b>loracarbef</b> and clindamycin in tonsillar surface fluid (TSF). Bacterial failure was defined as presence of GAS of the primary T-type within two weeks after completing therapy. 239 patients with GAS pharyngotonsillitis were treated with pcV for ten days. 53 patients with bacterial failure were randomized to treatment with either pcV or clindamycin and were then followed for one year. Failure and non-failure strains were screened for penicillin tolerance and some were subjected to time killing tests. Using AP-PCR the DNA-profiles of failure and non-failure strains were compared. PcV, <b>loracarbef</b> and clindamycin were investigated regarding concentration in TSF during and after ten days treatment of GAS pharyngotonsillitis. CRP and orosomucoid were analyzed throughout the investigation period. In the pcV group 14 / 22 patients yielded GAS in the throat culture after the first retreatment, compared to 0 / 26 in the clindamycin group. In the first three months 15 / 22 patients in the pcV group yielded one or more positive cultures for GAS, all of the same T-type as compared to 3 / 26 in the clindamycin group, which all were of another T-type. The difference between the groups was later reduced. However, clindamycin could prevent further treatment failures for at least the first three months after failure in pcV treated GAS pharyngotonsillitis. No penicillin tolerant strains could be identified and penicillin tolerance seems to be of no significance in failures of pcV treated GAS pharyngotonsillitis. The strains were of three different T-types, and eleven different clones were identified. The same clones were found in both failures and non-failures. PcV was found in TSF during the first three day period of treatment, after which the concentration declined. <b>Loracarbef</b> and clindamycin showed more longstanding concentration in TSF, with measurable values even after therapy. This may contribute to their capacity to eradicate GAS in patients who failed on pcV treatment of GAS pharyngotonsillitis. CRP was of no significance as indicator of GAS as a cause of pharyngotonsillitis...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{determine}} antimicrobial activity against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. MethodsA central laboratory performed NCCLS susceptibility {{testing for}} all isolates and β-lactamase and capsular serotype determinations for H. influenzae. ResultsA total of 2712 H. influenzae and 1079 M. catarrhalis were collected. H. influenzae susceptibilities were > 90 % for amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, <b>loracarbef,</b> cefprozil, cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin and clarithromycin and were < 80 % for trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and ampicillin. 19. 3 % were β-lactamase positive. The most common serotype was type-b (5. 6 %); 86. 1 % were nontypeable. M. catarrhalis had MIC 90 within therapeutic range for all antimicrobials except ampicillin. ConclusionThe {{conclusion of the}} study is that antimicrobials, except ampicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, remain good empiric choices against H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis...|$|E
40|$|Seven hundred twenty-three {{isolates}} of Moraxella catarrhalis {{obtained from}} outpatients {{with a variety}} of infections in 30 medical centers in the United States between 1 November 1994 and 30 April 1995 were characterized in a central laboratory. The overall rate of beta-lactamase production was 95. 3 %. When the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards MIC interpretive breakpoints for Haemophilus influenzae were applied, percentages of strains found to be susceptible to selected oral antimicrobial agents were as follows: azithromycin, clarithromycin, and erythromycin, 100 %; tetracycline and chloramphenicol, 100 %; amoxicillin-clavulanate, 100 %; cefixime, 99. 3 %; cefpodoxime, 99. 0 %; cefaclor, 99. 4 %; <b>loracarbef,</b> 99. 0 %; cefuroxime, 98. 5 %; cefprozil, 94. 3 %; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 93. 5 %...|$|E
40|$|Agar {{dilution}} MIC methodology {{was used}} to test the activities of GV 118819 X (sanfetrinem), ampicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefpodoxime, <b>loracarbef,</b> levofloxacin, clarithromycin, ceftriaxone, imipenem, and vancomycin against 53 penicillin-susceptible, 84 penicillin-intermediate and 74 penicillin-resistant pneumococci isolated in the United States. GV 118819 X was the most active oral beta-lactam, with MIC at which 50 % of the isolates were inhibited (MIC 50) /MIC 90 values of 0. 008 / 0. 03, 0. 06 / 0. 5, and 0. 5 / 1. 0 micrograms/ml against penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate, and -resistant stains, respectively. Amoxicillin and amoxicillin in the presence of clavulanate (2 : 1) were the second most-active oral beta-lactams, followed by ampicillin and cefpodoxime; <b>loracarbef</b> was not active against penicillin-intermediate and -resistant strains. Clarithromycin was most active against penicillin-susceptible strains but was less active against intermediate and resistant stains. All pneumococcal stains were inhibited by ceftriaxone and imipenem at MICs of < or = 4. 0 and < or = 1. 0 micrograms/ml, respectively. The activities of levofloxacin and vancomycin were unaffected by penicillin susceptibility. Time-kill studies of three penicillin-susceptible, three penicillin-intermediate, and three penicillin-resistant pneumococci showed that all compounds, at the broth microdilution MIC, yielded 99. 9 % killing of all strains after 24 h. Kinetic patterns of all oral beta-lactams, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin were similar relative to the MIC, with 90 % killing of all strains first observed after 12 h. However, killing by amoxicillin-clavulanate, imipenem, and levofloxacin was slightly faster and that by clarithromycin was slower than that by the above-described drugs. At 2 x the MIC, more strains were killed earlier than was the case at the MIC, but the pattern seen at the MIC prevailed. When MICs and kill kinetics were combined, sanfetrinem was the most active oral antipneumococcal agent in this study...|$|E
40|$|The β-lactam susceptibilities of 65 {{strains of}} Streptococcus pneumoniae for which {{penicillin}} MICs covered {{a broad range}} were assessed. The order of potency was amoxicillin (AMX) = amoxicillin-clavulanate (AMC) > penicillin G > cefpodoxime (CPO) > cefuroxime (CXM) > cefprozil > cefaclor > <b>loracarbef</b> > cefixime. No decrease in susceptibility was seen following repeated subculture of two penicillin-susceptible strains of S. pneumoniae in AMX, AMC, cefaclor, or <b>loracarbef,</b> whereas repeated exposure to CPO and CXM resulted in 4 - to 32 -fold decreases in susceptibility for both strains. When one of these strains was exposed to concentrations of CPO, CXM, AMX, and AMC achieved in the serum of humans following the administration of an oral dose, all agents were rapidly bactericidal, with no decrease in susceptibility up to 72 h. This was consistent with antibiotic concentrations exceeding the MICs for 100 % of the dosing interval. For a penicillin-resistant strain, MICs were exceeded for 29 % of the 12 -h dosing interval for 500 mg of AMX, 42 % of the interval for AMC with 875 mg of AMX and 125 mg of clavulanate (875 / 125 mg of AMC) 21 % of the interval for 500 mg of CXM, and 0 % of the interval for 200 mg of CPO. Consequently, only 875 / 125 mg of AMC produced a sustained bactericidal effect. A four- to eightfold reduction in susceptibility to CPO and CXM and cross-resistance with cefotaxime, but not penicillin or AMC, were selected following exposure to simulated serum CPO and CXM concentrations. In addition, AMX and AMC were the only agents which consistently produced a > 99 % reduction in bacterial numbers in time-kill studies using concentrations of antibiotic achieved in middle ear fluid for all three strains of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae tested...|$|E

40|$|To prospectively {{evaluate}} patient (parent), physician, {{and nurse}} satisfaction with antibiotics, 12, 102 children in 661 pediatric study centers throughout the United States with infections {{to be treated}} on an outpatient basis were followed with questionnaires completed by parents and with interviews of patients and their parents. Comprehensive surveys were also completed by participating pediatricians and their nursing staffs of which 11, 913 (98. 4 %) contained adequate information for inclusion in an analysis. Data were combined and analyzed using standard statistical methods. <b>Loracarbef</b> was perceived as being superior to other antibiotics based on cost, palatability, and dosing intervals. Few differences were seen among most antibiotics based on treatment outcome or adverse events. All antibiotics studied offered acceptable efficacy and were well tolerated as judged by physicians, nurses, parents, and children.

40|$|The susceptibilities of Streptococcus pneumoniae (1, 476 strains) and untypeable Haemophilus influenzae (1, 676 strains) {{to various}} oral β-lactam, macrolide-azalide, and {{fluoroquinolone}} antimicrobial agents {{were determined by}} broth microdilution. Organisms were isolated from specimens obtained from outpatients in six geographic regions of the United States. MIC data were interpreted according to pharmacodynamically derived breakpoints applicable to the oral agents tested. Among H. influenzae strains, 41. 6 % were β-lactamase positive. Virtually all H. influenzae strains were susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate (98 %), cefixime (100 %), and ciprofloxacin (100 %), while 78 % were susceptible to cefuroxime, 57 % were susceptible to amoxicillin, 14 % were susceptible to cefprozil, 9 % were susceptible to <b>loracarbef,</b> 2 % were susceptible to cefaclor, and 0 % were susceptible to azithromycin and clarithromycin. Among S. pneumoniae isolates, 49. 6 % were penicillin susceptible, 17. 9 % were intermediate, and 32. 5 % were penicillin resistant, with penicillin MICs for 50 and 90 % of the isolates tested of 0. 12 and 4 μg/ml, respectively. Overall, 94 % of S. pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate, 69 % were susceptible to azithromycin and clarithromycin, 63 % were susceptible to cefprozil and cefuroxime, 52 % were susceptible to cefixime, 22 % were susceptible to cefaclor, and 11 % were susceptible to <b>loracarbef.</b> Although ciprofloxacin has marginal activity against S. pneumoniae, no high-level fluoroquinolone-resistant strains were found. Significant cross-resistance was found between penicillin and macrolides-azalides among S. pneumoniae isolates, with 5 % of the penicillin-susceptible strains being macrolide-azalide resistant, compared with 37 % of the intermediate isolates and 66 % of the resistant isolates. Resistance was highest in S. pneumoniae isolates from patients younger than 10 years of age, middle ear and paranasal sinus specimens, and the southern half of the United States. With the continuing rise in resistance, judicious use of oral antimicrobial agents is necessary in all age groups...|$|E
