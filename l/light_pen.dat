5|$|During the 1950s, various {{computer}} games {{were created in}} the context of academic computer and programming research and for demonstrations of computing power, especially after the introduction later in the decade of smaller and faster computers on which programs could be created and run in real time as opposed to being executed in batches. A few programs, however, while used to showcase the power of the computer they ran on were also intended as entertainment products; these were generally created by undergraduate and graduate students and university employees, such as at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where they were allowed on occasion to develop programs for the TX-0 experimental computer. These interactive graphical games were created by a community of programmers, many of them students and university employees affiliated with the Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) led by Alan Kotok, Peter Samson, and Bob Saunders. The games included Tic-Tac-Toe, which used a <b>light</b> <b>pen</b> to play a simple game of noughts and crosses against the computer, and Mouse in the Maze, which used a <b>light</b> <b>pen</b> to set up a maze of walls for a virtual mouse to traverse.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, DEC {{commissioned}} {{the creation of}} a real-time, graphical version of Lunar Lander, which was intended to showcase the capabilities of their new DEC GT40 graphics terminals, when connected to their PDP-10 or PDP-11 minicomputers. The game was written by Jack Burness, a DEC consultant, and named Moonlander; it was distributed with DEC computers and displayed at trade shows. Unlike the previous turn-based, textual games, Moonlander is a real-time graphical game. The goal remains to correctly land a lunar module {{on the surface of the}} moon using the game's telemetry data. If the player miscalculates the module's landing, the module will either fly off into space or crash into the moon's surface. The game is controlled with a <b>light</b> <b>pen,</b> and the output display was a vector graphics system; the <b>light</b> <b>pen</b> allowed adjusting the throttle value and the angle of the lunar lander. Burness has said that he does not recall playing the original Lunar, but that by 1973 there were numerous versions of the game which he had played. He based the calculations of the fuel consumption for maneuvering the rocket on the actual lunar lander specifications, which he obtained from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which co-designed the lander. The entire game was written in ten days.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, {{improvements}} in computing {{technology and the}} early development of relatively cheaper mainframe computers, which would later be termed minicomputers, led to the loosening of restrictions regarding programming access to the computers. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), access to the TX-0 experimental computer was opened to students and employees of the university. This in turn {{led to the development}} of programs that in addition to highlighting the power of the computer also contained an entertainment aspect. The games created for the TX-0 by the small programming community at MIT included Tic-Tac-Toe, which used a <b>light</b> <b>pen</b> to play a simple game of noughts and crosses against the computer, and Mouse in the Maze, which let players set up a maze for a mouse to run through. When the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-1 computer was installed at MIT in 1961, the community built a video game to showcase its abilities, Spacewar, which then became the first known video game to spread beyond a single computer installation as it was copied and recreated on other PDP-1 systems and later on other mainframe computers.|$|E

50|$|The Dragon uses {{analogue}} joysticks, {{unlike most}} {{systems of the}} time which used less versatile but cheaper digital systems. Other uses for the joystick ports include <b>light</b> <b>pens.</b>|$|R
25|$|The world's first {{successful}} implementation of a CPOE system was at El Camino Hospital in Mountain View, California in the early 1970s. The Medical Information System (MIS) was originally developed by a software and hardware team at Lockheed in Sunnyvale, California, which became the TMIS group at Technicon Instruments Corporation. The MIS system used a <b>light</b> <b>pen</b> to allow physicians and nurses to quickly point and click items to be ordered.|$|E
25|$|Further {{advances}} in computing led to greater advancements in interactive computer graphics. In 1959, the TX-2 computer was developed at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory. The TX-2 integrated {{a number of}} new man-machine interfaces. A <b>light</b> <b>pen</b> could be used to draw sketches on the computer using Ivan Sutherland's revolutionary Sketchpad software. Using a <b>light</b> <b>pen,</b> Sketchpad allowed one to draw simple shapes on the computer screen, save them and even recall them later. The <b>light</b> <b>pen</b> itself had a small photoelectric cell in its tip. This cell emitted an electronic pulse whenever it was placed {{in front of a computer}} screen and the screen's electron gun fired directly at it. By simply timing the electronic pulse with the current location of the electron gun, it was easy to pinpoint exactly where the pen was on the screen at any given moment. Once that was determined, the computer could then draw a cursor at that location. Sutherland seemed to find the perfect solution for many of the graphics problems he faced. Even today, many standards of computer graphics interfaces got their start with this early Sketchpad program. One example of this is in drawing constraints. If one wants to draw a square for example, they do not have to worry about drawing four lines perfectly to form the edges of the box. One can simply specify that they want to draw a box, and then specify the location and size of the box. The software will then construct a perfect box, with the right dimensions and at the right location. Another example is that Sutherland's software modeled objects - not just a picture of objects. In other words, with a model of a car, one could change the size of the tires without affecting the rest of the car. It could stretch the body of car without deforming the tires.|$|E
25|$|With his {{recording}} {{studio in the}} same building as his home located in the Hollywood Hills, Franke would attend creative meetings before scoring the on average 25 minutes of music for each episode. Utilising Cubase software through an electronic keyboard, or for more complex pieces a <b>light</b> <b>pen</b> and graphics tablet, he would begin by developing the melodic content round which the ambient components and transitions were added. Using playbacks with digital samples of the appropriate instruments, such as a group of violins, he would decide which tracks to produce electronically or record acoustically.|$|E
50|$|Common input {{peripherals}} include keyboards, computer mice, graphic tablets, touchscreens, barcode readers, image scanners, microphones, webcams, game controllers, <b>light</b> <b>pens,</b> {{and digital}} cameras. Common output peripherals include computer displays, printers, projectors, and computer speakers.|$|R
5000|$|COMIT was a {{sophisticated}} system of computer-assisted instruction developed jointly by IBM and the University of Waterloo in Canada. It emphasized unique audiovisual {{capabilities of the}} television set and <b>light</b> <b>pens.</b> The project ran until 1978.|$|R
50|$|The company {{started to}} {{manufacture}} products related to home computers that were {{popular in the}} 1980s such as the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum. Such devices included <b>light</b> <b>pens</b> and memory expansion. One of their first commercial successes was joystick interfaces for the ZX Spectrum.|$|R
25|$|Ivan Sutherland {{developed}} Sketchpad in 1963, {{widely held}} {{as the first}} graphical computer-aided design program. It used a <b>light</b> <b>pen</b> to create and manipulate objects in engineering drawings in realtime with coordinated graphics. In the late 1960s, researchers at the Stanford Research Institute, led by Douglas Engelbart, developed the On-Line System (NLS), which used text-based hyperlinks manipulated with a then new device: the mouse. In the 1970s, Engelbart's ideas were further refined and extended to graphics by researchers at Xerox PARC and specifically Alan Kay, who went beyond text-based hyperlinks and used a GUI as the main interface for the Xerox Alto computer, released in 1973. Most modern general-purpose GUIs are derived from this system.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} few years, during 1957–61, various {{computer}} games continued to be created {{in the context of}} academic computer and programming research, particularly as computer technology improved to include smaller, transistor-based computers on which programs could be created and run in real time, rather than operations run in batches. A few programs, however, while used to showcase the power of the computer they ran on were also intended as entertainment products; these were generally created by undergraduate students, such as at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where they were allowed on occasion to develop programs for the TX-0 experimental computer.

The games included Tic-Tac-Toe, which used a <b>light</b> <b>pen</b> to play a simple game of noughts and crosses against the computer, and Mouse in the Maze. Mouse in the Maze allowed users to use a <b>light</b> <b>pen</b> to set up a maze of walls on the monitor, and spots that represented bits of cheese or glasses of martini. A virtual mouse was then released and would traverse the maze to find the objects. [...] Additionally, the wargame simulations from the early 1950s by the RAND Corporation had expanded into more complicated simulations which required little human intervention, and had also sparked the creation of business management simulation games such as The Management Game, which was used in business schools such as at Carnegie Mellon University by 1958. By 1961, there were over 89 different business simulation games in use, with various graphical capabilities. As the decade ended, despite several video games having been developed, {{there was no such thing}} as a commercial video game industry; almost all games had been developed on or as a single machine for specific purposes, and the few simulation games were neither commercial nor for entertainment.|$|E
500|$|The Final Jeopardy! round {{features}} a single clue. At {{the end of}} the Double Jeopardy! round, the host announces the Final Jeopardy! category, and a commercial break follows. During the break, barriers are placed between the contestant lecterns, and each contestant makes a final wager between $0 and his/her entire score. Contestants enter their wagers using a <b>light</b> <b>pen</b> to write on an electronic display on their lectern. After the break, the Final Jeopardy! clue is revealed and read by the host. The contestants have 30 seconds to write their responses on the electronic display, while the show's iconic [...] "Think!" [...] music plays in the background. In the event that either the display or the pen malfunctions, contestants can use an index card and a marker to manually write their response and wager. Visually impaired or blind contestants use a Braille keyboard to type in a wager and response.|$|E

2500|$|Early {{projects}} like the Whirlwind and SAGE Projects introduced the CRT {{as a viable}} display and interaction interface and introduced the <b>light</b> <b>pen</b> as an input device. Douglas T. Ross of the Whirlwind SAGE system performed a personal experiment in [...] which a small program he wrote captured the movement of his finger and displayed its vector (his traced name) on a display scope. One of the first interactive video games to feature recognizable, interactive graphics – Tennis for Two – was created for an oscilloscope by William Higinbotham to entertain visitors in 1958 at Brookhaven National Laboratory and simulated a tennis match. In 1959, Douglas T. Ross innovated again while working at MIT on transforming mathematic statements into computer generated machine tool vectors, and {{took the opportunity to}} create a display scope image of a Disney cartoon character.|$|E
2500|$|The machine {{included}} {{a number of}} extra input/output interfaces: serial and parallel printer ports; an 8-bit general purpose digital I/O port; a port offering four analogue inputs, a <b>light</b> <b>pen</b> input, and switch inputs; and an expansion connector (the [...] "1 MHz bus") that enabled other hardware to be connected. [...] Extra ROMs could be fitted (four on the PCB or sixteen with expansion hardware) and accessed via [...] An Econet network interface and a disk drive interface were available as options. All motherboards had space for the electronic components, but Econet was rarely fitted. Additionally, an Acorn proprietary interface named the [...] "Tube" [...] allowed a second processor to be added. Three models of second processor were offered by Acorn, based on the 6502, Z80 and 32016 CPUs. The Tube was later used in third-party add-ons, including a Zilog Z80 board and hard disk drive from Torch that allowed the BBC machine to run CP/M programs.|$|E

60|$|It {{was on a}} day of rare {{beauty that}} I {{went out into the}} fields to try and gather these few thoughts. So golden and sweetly hot it was, that they came lazily, and with a flight no more {{coherent}} or responsible than the swoop of the very swallows; and, as in a play or poem, the result is conditioned by the conceiving mood, so I knew would be the nature of my diving, dipping, pale-throated, fork-tailed words. But, after all--I thought, sitting there--I need not take my critical pronouncements seriously. I have not the firm soul of the critic. It is not my profession to know 'things for certain, and to make others feel that certainty. On the contrary, I am often wrong--a luxury no critic can afford. And so, invading as I was the realm of others, I advanced with a <b>light</b> <b>pen,</b> feeling that none, and least of all myself, need expect me to be right.|$|E
50|$|Also, many PDAs {{and lately}} tablet PCs can already convert pen (also called stylus) {{movements}} on their touchscreens to computer understandable text successfully.

60|$|But it is {{very hard}} to write about any country a book that does not {{represent}} the country described in a more or less ridiculous point of view. It is hard at least to do so in such a book as I must write. A de Tocqueville may do it. It may be done by any philosophico-political or politico-statistical, or statistico- scientific writer; but it can hardly be done by a man who professes to use a <b>light</b> <b>pen,</b> and to manufacture his article for the use of general readers. Such a writer may tell all that he sees of the beautiful; but he must also tell, if not all that he sees of the ludicrous, at any rate the most piquant part of it. How to do this without being offensive is the problem which a man with such a task before him has to solve. His first duty is owed to his readers, and consists mainly in this: that he shall tell the truth, and shall so tell that truth that what he has written may be readable. But a second duty is due to those of whom he writes; and he does not perform that duty well if he gives offense to those as to whom, on the summing up of the whole evidence for and against them in his own mind, he intends to give a favorable verdict. There are of course those against whom a writer does not intend to give a favorable verdict; people and places whom he desires to describe, on the peril of his own judgment, as bad, ill educated, ugly, and odious. In such cases his course is straightforward enough. His judgment may be in great peril, but his volume or chapter will be easily written. Ridicule and censure run glibly from the pen, and form themselves into sharp paragraphs which are pleasant to the reader. Whereas eulogy is commonly dull, and too frequently sounds as though it were false. There is much difficulty in expressing a verdict which is intended to be favorable; but which, though favorable, shall not be falsely eulogistic; and though true, not offensive.|$|E

The standard was so engrained that it led to devices like the Kempston Interface that allowed Atari joysticks to be used on the ZX Spectrum.
