60|$|I ran in, took up {{the chain}} with both hands, and tugged with all my might. Emett, too, had all his weight on the lasso round her neck. Between {{the two of us}} we choked her hold loose, but she brought Jones' leather <b>leggin</b> in her teeth. Then I dropped the chain and jumped.|$|E
60|$|Having now {{described}} {{the way of}} using this machine, we will rejoin Stemaw, whom we left {{on his way to}} the next trap. There he goes, moving swiftly over the snow mile after mile, as if he could not feel fatigue, turning aside now and then to visit a trap, and giving a short grunt when nothing is in it, or killing the animal when caught, and tying it on the sledge. Towards midnight, however, he begins to walk more cautiously, examines the priming of his gun, and moves the axe in his belt, as if he expected to meet some enemy suddenly. The fact is, that close to where he now stands are two traps which he set in the morning close to each other for the purpose of catching one of the formidable coast wolves. These animals are so sagacious that they will scrape all round a trap, let it be ever so well set, and after eating all the bait, walk away unhurt. Indians consequently endeavour in every possible way to catch them--and, among others, by setting two traps close together; so that, while the wolf scrapes at one, he may perhaps put his foot in the other. It is in this way that Stemaw's traps are set, and he now proceeds cautiously towards them, his gun in the hollow of his left arm. Slowly he advances, peering through the bushes, but nothing is visible; suddenly a branch crashes under his snow-shoe, and with a savage growl a large wolf bounds towards him, landing almost at his feet. A single glance, however, shows the Indian that both traps are on his legs, and that the chains prevent his further advance. He places his gun against a tree, draws his axe from the belt, and advances to kill the animal. It is an undertaking, however, of some difficulty. The fierce brute, which is larger than a Newfoundland dog, strains every nerve and sinew to break its chains; while its eyes glisten in the uncertain light, and foam curls from its blood-red mouth. Now it retreats as the Indian advances, grinning horribly as it goes; and anon, as the chains check its further retreat, it springs with fearful growl towards Stemaw, who slightly wounds it with his axe, as he jumps backward just in time to save himself from the infuriated animal, which catches in its fangs the flap of his <b>leggin,</b> and tears it from his limb. Again Stemaw advances, and the wolf retreats and again springs on him, but without success. At last, as the wolf glances for a moment to one side--apparently to see if there is no way of escape--quick as lightning the axe descends with stunning violence on its head; another blow follows; and in five minutes more Stemaw heaves the huge brute across his shoulders, and carries it to his sledge.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2016, the Valley View Choir, {{under the}} {{direction}} of Gina Lupini Pascolini, was requested for the students to perform in Wales in the summer of 2017, with Côr Dathlu Cwmtawe and their Regional High School, Ysgol Bro Dynefwr. This request reflects a great honor for the Valley View School District, and will be student funded. The school district will not be funding this trip. The group of 31 singers is called [...] "Voices of the Valley" [...] and performs in local concerts around the Lackawanna county. Members of the choir include Cassandra Dumas, Joshua Rudolph, Julia Krupka, Kassidy <b>Leggin,</b> Kaedy Masters, Eric Lee, Ashley Fidler, Justin Thomas, Janet Zhao, Paul Vanvestraut, Brianna Pallo, Christopher Benitez, Emily Williams, Kevin Mellow, Sarah Ferraro, Joseph Morisco, Samantha Humen, Noah McKane, Ryleah Ruffner, Cammie Gillar, Carleigh Gillar, Teresa Dumas, Noah Reed, Lorna Yushinsky, Noah Benjamin, Deanna Soulsby, Mia Tomassoni, Gia Mercatili, Kara Hirjak, and Beatrice Chindemi.|$|E
60|$|The rescued man wore a {{buckskin}} hunting {{shirt and}} <b>leggins</b> and moccasins {{of the same}} material, all very much the worse for wear. The <b>leggins</b> were torn into tatters and the moccasins worn through. His face was pinched with suffering and one arm was bleeding from a gunshot wound near the shoulder.|$|R
60|$|The {{dress of}} the Indians upon this {{occasion}} was generally blue cloth capotes with hoods, scarlet or blue cloth <b>leggins,</b> quill-worked moccasins, and no caps. Some {{of them were}} dressed very funnily; {{and one or two}} of the oldest appeared in blue surtouts, which were very ill made, and much too large for the wearers. The ladies had short gowns without plaits, cloth <b>leggins</b> of various colours highly ornamented with beads, cotton handkerchiefs on their necks, and sometimes also on their heads. The boys and girls were just their seniors in miniature.|$|R

30|$|The error {{associated}} with applying the FFI over this time interval also defined the minimal detectable change (MDC), i.e. the {{minimum amount of}} change necessary for the FFI score (with 90  % confidence) to {{be considered to be}} a real change over the time frame of a maximum of one week. The MDC was calculated using the following formula: MDC =  1.65.√ 2.SEM (<b>Leggin</b> et al. 2006; Lopes et al. 2008; Martin and Irrgang 2007).|$|E
30|$|To {{ascertain}} the intra and inter-observer reliability, the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated. The IC of the FFI subscales was evaluated {{by means of}} Cronbach’s alpha coefficient. The reliability results were combined with the total FFI scores and their subscales in order to define the standard error of measurement (SEM) (Beaton et al. 2000). The SEM was calculated using the following formula: SEM = SD 1.√(1  − ICC), where SD 1  = is the standard deviation of the initial evaluation and ICC = the ICC found in the reproducibility analysis (Beaton et al. 2000; <b>Leggin</b> et al. 2006; Lopes et al. 2008; Martin and Irrgang 2007).|$|E

5000|$|On August 13, 1878, {{more than}} 60 warriors rode into the Malheur Indian Agency and were arrested after they {{surrendered}} to American troops. Among the warriors were Cheegibah (<b>Leggins),</b> son of Natchez (Boy) and grandson of Chief Winnemucca the Younger; Otiz (Left Hand), grandson of Owitze (Twisted Hand) and Ochiho (Red Willow), son of Chochoco (Has No Horse). [...] Under intense interrogation, <b>Leggins</b> identified the ranking war chiefs: Oytes (Left Hand), Bannock Joe Pohave (Racehorse), Captain Bearskin (Honalelo (Little Bearskin Dick)), Big John Ponce (Three Coyotes), Eagle Eye Wahweveh (Black Eagle), Charley Chongyo (Pipe), D.E. Johnson, Beads, and Surger Wahi (Fox). [...] Most {{of the leaders}} whom <b>Leggins</b> named were shot in 1878. [...] Lieutenant Colonel James Forsyth reported that his troops had killed Wahweveh (Black Eagle) on July 31, 1878; however, in spring 1879 Wahweveh and medicine chief Tamanmo (Black Spirit), with a few Snake dog soldiers, raided a mining camp on the Oregon-Idaho border and killed several Chinese laborers. American troops under several leaders responded {{with a series of}} battles which became known as the Sheepeater War.|$|R
60|$|The Colonel {{threw open}} the door. Wetzel, Major McColloch, Jonathan and Silas Zane were approaching. They were all heavily armed. Wetzel was {{equipped}} for a long chase. Double <b>leggins</b> were laced round his legs. A buckskin knapsack was strapped to his shoulders.|$|R
60|$|The summer {{dress of}} the Indian {{is almost entirely}} {{provided}} for him by the Hudson Bay Company. It consists chiefly of a blue or grey cloth, or else a blanket capote reaching below the knee, made much too loose for the figure, and strapped round the waist with a scarlet or crimson worsted belt. A very coarse blue striped cotton shirt is all the underclothing they wear, holding trousers to be quite superfluous; in lieu of which they make <b>leggins</b> of various kinds of cloth, which reach from a few inches above the knee down to the ankle. These <b>leggins</b> are sometimes very tastefully decorated with bead-work, particularly those of the women, and are provided with flaps or wings on either side.|$|R
60|$|Dark stains {{spotted the}} bright frills of his gaudy dress, his {{buckskin}} coat and <b>leggins,</b> and dotted his white eagle plumes. Dark stains, horribly suggestive, covered him {{from head to}} foot. Blood stains! The innocent blood of Christians crimsoned his renegade's body, and every dark red blotch cried murder.|$|R
50|$|In 1844, while out hunting buffalo, Rattling Blanket Woman's husband, Waglula (Worm) helped {{defend a}} Lakota village {{under attack by}} the Crow. He was given three wives by the village head man, Corn-- Iron Between Horns, Kills Enemy, and Red <b>Leggins.</b> They were Corn's daughters, and their mother {{had been killed in}} the attack.|$|R
60|$|A {{minute or}} two {{afterwards}} he heard steps in the snow. The steps were heavy, as if the men were tired. Somebody knocked and Jim opened the door. Two men came in and throwing down their packs shook the snow from their ragged furs. Their boots were broken, their <b>leggins</b> badly worn, and their faces were pinched with cold.|$|R
60|$|The instant that Mohegan {{observed}} {{himself to}} be noticed by the group around the young stranger, he dropped the blanket which covered {{the upper part of}} his frame, from his shoulders, suffering it to fall over his <b>leggins</b> of untanned deer-skin, where it was retained by a belt of bark that confined it to his waist.|$|R
60|$|His {{interest}} in either party was but passive {{until he saw}} the khaki blouse, short skirt and trim <b>leggins</b> of the captive walking {{between two of the}} Dyaks of Muda Saffir's company. At the same instant he recognized the evil features of the rajah as those of the man who had directed the abduction of Virginia Maxon from the wrecked Ithaca.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yuh. Gee! it's a big place. Say, that Westminster Abbey's a great place. I was {{in there}} a couple of times. More darn tombs of kings and stuff. And I see a bishop, with <b>leggins</b> on! But I got kind of lonely. I thought of {{you a lot of}} times. Wished we could go out and get an ale together. Maybe pick up a couple of pretty girls." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{dress of}} these people is {{generally}} half civilized, half savage. They wear a capot or surcoat, made of a blanket, a striped cotton shirt, cloth trousers, or leathern <b>leggins,</b> moccasins of deer-skin, and a belt of variegated worsted, from which are suspended the knife, tobacco-pouch, and other implements. Their language is of the same piebald character, being a French patois, embroidered with Indian and English words and phrases.|$|R
6000|$|By and by, in the {{neighborhood}} of the Terrapin Tower, I came upon a gentle daughter of the aborigines in fringed and beaded buckskin moccasins and <b>leggins,</b> seated on a bench with her pretty wares about her. She had just carved out a wooden chief that had a strong family resemblance to a clothes-pin, and was now boring a hole through his abdomen to put his bow through. I hesitated a moment, and then addressed her: ...|$|R
60|$|She {{stared in}} bewilderment, flitting silent at his side. But in the cattle-market she shrank {{from the press}} of men, all men, all in heavy, filthy boots, and leathern <b>leggins.</b> And the road {{underfoot}} was all nasty with cow-muck. And it frightened her to see the cattle in the square pens, so many horns, and so little enclosure, and such a madness of men and a yelling of drovers. Also she felt her father was embarrassed by her, and ill-at-ease.|$|R
60|$|Like any man of mark, Samoa best {{speaks for}} himself; {{but we may}} as well convey some idea of his person. Though manly enough, nay, an obelisk in stature, the savage was far from being sentimentally prepossessing. Be not alarmed; but he wore his knife in the lobe of his dexter ear, which, by {{constant}} elongation almost drooped upon his shoulder. A mode of sheathing it exceedingly handy, and far less brigandish than the Highlander's dagger concealed in his <b>leggins.</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1844, Waglula went on a buffalo hunt. He came across a Miniconjou Lakota village under attack by Crow warriors. He led his small party of warriors to the village and rescued it. Corn, the head man of the village, had lost {{his wife in the}} raid. In {{gratitude}} he gave Waglula his two eldest daughters as wives: Iron Between Horns (age 18) and Kills Enemy (age 17). Corn's youngest daughter, Red <b>Leggins,</b> who was 15 at the time, requested to go with her sisters; all became Waglula's wives.|$|R
5000|$|An {{account of}} actor Noah Ludlow {{introducing}} the popular song [...] "The Hunters of Kentucky" [...] while wearing a coonskin cap {{is shown to}} be spurious in Ludlow's autobiography. Ludlow recounted that initial performance of 1822: [...] "As soon as the comedy of the night was over, I dressed myself in a buckskin hunting-shirt and <b>leggins,</b> which I borrowed off a river man, and with moccasins on my feet and an old slouched hat on my head, and a rifle on my shoulder, I presented myself before the audience." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Wetzel!" [...] exclaimed Col. Zane and Capt. Boggs. It {{was indeed}} the hunter. How startling was his appearance! The {{buckskin}} hunting coat and <b>leggins</b> were wet, torn and bespattered with mud; the water ran and dripped from him to form little muddy pools on the floor; only his rifle and powder horn were dry. His face was ghastly white except where a bullet wound appeared on his temple, from which the blood had oozed down over his cheek. An unearthly light gleamed from his eyes. In that moment Wetzel was an appalling sight.|$|R
60|$|The Arickaras {{generally}} go naked, but, {{like all}} savages, {{they have their}} gala dress, {{of which they are}} not a little vain. This usually consists of a gray surcoat and <b>leggins</b> of the dressed skin of the antelope, resembling chamois leather, and embroidered with porcupine quills brilliantly dyed. A buffalo robe is thrown over the right shoulder, and across the left is slung a quiver of arrows. They wear gay coronets of plumes, particularly those of the swan; but the feathers of the black eagle are considered the most worthy, being a sacred bird among the Indian warriors.|$|R
60|$|In {{thinking}} {{these things}} she fell asleep, {{and it seemed}} at once that she was well again, {{and that she was}} dressing for a walk. Clement had called for her to climb the mountains with him, and she was making preparation to go, working swiftly and unhesitatingly--and it seemed deliciously sweet to be swift and active once more. She had put on a short walking-skirt and <b>leggins</b> and was nearly ready. She stood before the glass to put on her cap, and as she saw how round and pink her cheeks were she hardly recognized herself.|$|R
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for the Twister Remix of [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] was also directed by Ray Kay, and released on September 8, 2012. For the music video, Spears sported a $20,000 sports bra and black <b>leggins</b> from Body Rock. It begins with four girls talking and resting in a dance studio. Once Spears {{enters the room}} and starts playing Twister with the girls, the scenario changes to a stage with a colorful background, and they all start performing a dance routine to a remix of the song. After the song stops and the four girls are seen laying down tired, Spears turns around to them and say, [...] "Way to rock the spots, ladies." ...|$|R
60|$|Picture to {{yourself}} a stern, muscular figure, in fanciful bandit costume, with pistols and poniards in belt, his brawny neck bare, a handkerchief loosely thrown around it, {{and the two}} ends in front strung with rings of all kinds, the spoils of travellers; reliques and medals hung on his breast; his hat decorated with various-colored ribbands; his vest and short breeches of bright colors and finely embroidered; his legs in buskins or <b>leggins.</b> Fancy him on a mountain height, among wild rocks and rugged oaks, leaning on his carbine as if meditating some exploit, while far below are beheld villages and villas, the scenes of his maraudings, with the wide Campagna dimly extending in the distance.|$|R
50|$|Many {{people found}} Natalia's manner pleasingly raffish; she dressed in men's jackets and <b>leggins.</b> She smoked. She {{was proud of}} her ancestry, {{especially}} her grand ducal grandfather. She liked to whisper the guests {{that she was a}} Romanov, a descendant of tsars. Soon she became known as the Queen of the Arbat, a district that was taking on some of the character of New York's Greenwich Village. Visitors found hers a warm hearth in a cold and gray metropolis. She embarked on an extraordinary career as a vertical motorcyclist at Gorky Park. She drove the machine up a wall. The secret to success, she said, was to feel the vehicle and to look only forward, never at the wheels. Then the war broke out.|$|R
60|$|During a {{fortnight}} that the travellers lingered at this place, their encampment was continually thronged by the Cheyennes. They were a civil, well-behaved people, cleanly in their persons, and decorous in their habits. The men were tall, straight and vigorous, with aquiline noses, and high cheek bones. Some were almost as naked as ancient statues, {{and might have}} stood as models for a statuary; others had <b>leggins</b> and moccasins of deer skin, and buffalo robes, which they threw gracefully over their shoulders. In a little while, however, they {{began to appear in}} more gorgeous array, tricked out in the finery obtained from the white men; bright cloths, brass rings, beads of various colors; and happy was he who could render himself hideous with vermilion.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{sorry to}} bring you to such a lonesome spot, Molly, my dear," [...] said Robin, as {{he sat on the}} trunk of a fallen tree, on the {{afternoon}} of the day on which he arrived at the scene of his future home; [...] "it'll be rayther tryin' at first, but you'll soon get used to it, and we won't be bothered hereaway wi' all the new-fangled notions o' settlement folk. We'll dwell in the free wilderness, where there are no tyrannical laws to hamper a man, an' no nonsensical customs to fix the fashion of his coat an' <b>leggins.</b> Besides, you'll have Roy an' Nelly an' Walter an' Larry to keep you company, lass, not to mention our neighbours to look in upon now and again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “You {{may make}} your laws, Judge,” be cried, “but who will you find {{to watch the}} {{mountains}} through the long summer days, or the lakes at night? Game is game, and be who finds may kill; {{that has been the}} law in these mountains for forty years to my sartain knowledge; and I think one old law is worth two new ones. None but a green one would wish to kill a doe with a fa’n by its side, unless his moccasins were getting old, or his <b>leggins</b> ragged, for the flesh is lean and coarse. But a rifle rings among the rocks along the lake shore, sometimes, as if fifty pieces were fired at once—it would be hard to tell where the man stood who pulled the trigger.” ...|$|R
60|$|But he {{was getting}} terribly tired now. The burning sun on the fells had sucked him up; but the damp heat of the woody crag sucked him up still more; and the {{perspiration}} {{ran out of the}} ends of his fingers and toes, and washed him cleaner than he had been for a whole year. But, of course, he dirtied everything, terribly as he went. There has been a great black smudge all down the crag ever since. And there have been more black beetles in Vendale since than ever were known before; all, of course, owing to Tom's having blacked the original papa of them all, just as he was setting off to be married, with a sky-blue coat and scarlet <b>leggins,</b> as smart as a gardener's dog with a polyanthus in his mouth.|$|R
