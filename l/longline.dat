5|$|In the Southern Hemisphere, {{commercial}} fishing for the porbeagle is mostly undocumented. Substantial numbers are caught incidentally by pelagic <b>longline</b> fisheries targeting more valuable {{species such as}} southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii), swordfish (Xiphius gladius), and Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides), including vessels operated by Japan, Uruguay, Argentina, South Africa, and New Zealand. Porbeagle catches by the Uruguayan tuna pelagic <b>longline</b> fishery peaked in 1984 with 150 tons landed. Records of catch per unit effort (CPUE) for this fishery have shown a 90% decline in porbeagle landings from 1988 to 1998, though it is uncertain whether this reflects a real population decline or changing fishing habits. New Zealand has reported annual catches of 150–300 tons, mostly of immature individuals, from 1998 to 2003.|$|E
5|$|Night {{sharks are}} quick, nocturnally active, {{schooling}} predators that feed mainly on small bony fishes and squid. Reproduction is viviparous {{as with the}} other members of its family; females mate during the summer and give birth to litters of usually 1218 pups after a gestation period of a year. This deepwater species is not known to pose a danger to humans. It is caught incidentally by commercial tuna and swordfish <b>longline</b> fisheries in the western Atlantic, and also by a targeted <b>longline</b> fishery operating off northeastern Brazil. The night shark is highly valued for its fins, and additionally as a source of meat, liver oil, and fishmeal. However, most sharks caught off northeastern Brazil have been found to contain unsafe concentrations of mercury.|$|E
5|$|Another study {{focusing}} on the Gulf of Mexico, using a mix of data from US pelagic <b>longline</b> surveys from the mid-1950s and observations from the late-1990s, estimated a decline in numbers in this location of 99.3% over this period. However, changes in fishing practices and data collection methods complicate estimates.|$|E
40|$|Catch and {{by-catch}} of artisanal fisheries (traps, {{trammel nets}} and <b>longlines)</b> in the Arrábida Marine Protected Area were studied. A total of 80 species were recorded for trammel nets, 36 for traps and 28 for <b>longlines.</b> Cephalopods {{accounted for more}} than 90 % of the biomass captured with traps and fish dominated in catches of trammel nets and <b>longlines</b> (64 % and 96 %). Discards, in number of individuals,were higher for trammel nets (57 %), followed by <b>longlines</b> (42 %) and traps (14 %). A larger number of species was identified more than 200 meters from the coastline for traps. A larger number of species was recorded in spring/summer for trammel nets. Catches were higher less than 200 meters from the coastline for <b>longlines.</b> Degradation, as a motive for discards, was very low in <b>longlines.</b> Catches below maturation size per sample day were relatively low for trammel nets and <b>longlines</b> target species and medium for traps. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences between the average profit per fishing day estimated for the three gears. The results show a high fishing effort being applied in the study area,causing impact on the marine environment, warranting further studies directed to target species in order {{to make way for a}} sustainable management...|$|R
40|$|Tuna and {{tuna-like fishes}} are under-exploited {{resources}} of Indian EEZ. Exploitation of oceanic tuna and billfishes are possible only by <b>longlining</b> and purse seining. Existing {{deep sea fishing}} vessels in India are mostly trawlers equipped for bottom trawling for shrimps and fishes. Most of them are stem trawlers and few are double riggers. Hence the deck layout is not suitable for either <b>longlining</b> or purse seining. Both <b>longlining</b> and purse seining for oceanic tuna and billfishes are specialized techniques which require special onboard facilities, deck layout and deck machineries like line haulers, chute, shooting and hauling accessories for <b>longlining</b> and special powerful purse winch, power block etc. for tuna piu'se seining...|$|R
50|$|Industrial <b>longlining</b> was {{primarily}} perfected by Japanese fishermen who expanded into new grounds in the Western Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans {{in the late}} 1950s and early 1960s. <b>Longlining</b> has since been adopted by other fishermen, most notably South Korea, Taiwan, and the United States.|$|R
5|$|Of the 22 {{species of}} {{albatross}} recognised by the IUCN, all {{are listed as}} at some level of concern; 3 species are Critically Endangered, 5 species are Endangered, 7 species are Near Threatened, and 7 species are Vulnerable. Numbers of albatrosses have declined in the past due to harvesting for feathers, but today the albatrosses are threatened by introduced species, such as rats and feral cats that attack eggs, chicks and nesting adults; by pollution; by a serious decline in fish stocks in many regions largely due to overfishing; and by <b>longline</b> fishing. <b>Longline</b> fisheries pose the greatest threat, as feeding birds are attracted to the bait, become hooked on the lines, and drown. Identified stakeholders such as governments, conservation organisations {{and people in the}} fishing industry are all working toward reducing this bycatch.|$|E
5|$|The oceanic whitetip is {{a commercially}} {{important}} species for its fins, meat, and oil. It is eaten fresh, smoked, dried, and salted and its hide {{is used for}} leather. It is subject to fishing pressure throughout virtually its whole rangealthough it is more often taken as bycatch than by design, since it is drawn to <b>longline</b> bait that is intended for other species.|$|E
5|$|Fishing gear is {{the biggest}} threat to loggerheads in the open ocean. They often become {{entangled}} in longlines or gillnets. According to the 2009 status review of loggerheads by the Fisheries Service, drowning from entanglement in <b>longline</b> and gillnet fishing gear is the turtles’ primary threat in the North Pacific. They also become stuck in traps, pots, trawls, and dredges. Caught in this unattended equipment, loggerheads risk serious injury or drowning. Turtle excluder devices for nets and other traps reduce the number being accidentally caught.|$|E

5|$|Fishing {{regulations}} include catch {{limits and}} gear restrictions to prevent {{damage to the}} species habitat and population. There are different gear restrictions for commercial and recreational fishers. In 2007, regulations were imposed to reduce the harvesting by one third, {{as a response to}} overfishing in the South Atlantic. The South Atlantic catch limit was later increased in October 2012 {{as a response to the}} increased population. The 2013 limits in the southern U.S. Atlantic waters for the species, measured in gutted weight, is currently 405,971 pounds for <b>longline</b> and 135,324 pounds for hook-and-line fishing.|$|E
5|$|Despite its size, {{the common}} {{thresher}} is minimally dangerous to humans {{due to its}} relatively small teeth and timid disposition. It is highly valued by commercial fishers for its meat, fins, hide, and liver oil; large numbers are taken by <b>longline</b> and gillnet fisheries throughout its range. This shark is also esteemed by recreational anglers for the exceptional fight it offers on hook-and-line. The common thresher has a low rate of reproduction and cannot withstand heavy fishing pressure for long, {{a case in point}} being the rapid collapse of the thresher shark fishery off California in the 1980s. With commercial exploitation increasing {{in many parts of the}} world, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|Feeding almost {{exclusively}} on octopuses and other cephalopods, the Australian weasel shark mostly hunts near the sea floor. It is viviparous, with the developing embryos nourished through a placental connection and born after a six-month gestation period. This species is productive for a shark, with females bearing litters of 1–19 pups usually twice per year. The Australian weasel shark is caught by trawl {{and to a lesser}} extent gillnet and <b>longline</b> fisheries, though not in such numbers that its population is threatened. Thus, it has been listed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E

25|$|The China National Fishery Corporation (CNFC) is {{the major}} {{operator}} in the distant water fisheries. It sent the first Chinese fishing fleet to West African waters in 1985. The following year, with other Chinese partners, CNFC started trawling operations in the North Pacific. Tuna <b>longlining</b> followed in the South Pacific, and in 1989, squid <b>longlining</b> in the Japan Sea and the North Pacific.|$|R
50|$|Netting is the {{principal}} method of commercial fishing, though <b>longlining,</b> trolling, dredging and traps are also used.|$|R
5|$|Harmless to humans, the hardnose shark {{is caught}} with {{gillnets}} and line gear by artisanal and commercial fisheries {{across much of}} its range. It is used for meat, which is sold fresh or dried and salted, though its small size limits its economic importance. Its low reproductive rate may render it susceptible to overfishing, and given existing levels of exploitation, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Near Threatened. Off northern Australia, the hardnose shark makes up 13.6% of the gillnet catch and 4.0% of the <b>longline</b> catch. Since these losses {{do not appear to}} have diminished its population there, the IUCN has given it a regional assessment of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The common {{thresher}} {{is widely}} caught by offshore <b>longline</b> and pelagic gillnet fisheries, {{especially in the}} northwestern Indian Ocean, the western, central, and eastern Pacific, and the North Atlantic. Participating countries include the former USSR, Japan, Taiwan, Spain, the United States, Brazil, Uruguay, and Mexico. The meat is highly prized for human consumption cooked, dried and salted, or smoked. In addition, their skin is made into leather, their liver oil is processed for vitamins, and their fins are used for shark fin soup. The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) reported a worldwide common thresher take of 411 metric tons in 2006.|$|E
5|$|The {{milk shark}} is {{harmless}} to humans {{because of its}} small size and teeth. Caught using longlines, gillnets, trawls, and hook-and-line, this shark is marketed fresh or dried and salted for human consumption, and is also used for shark fin soup and fishmeal. Its abundance makes it a significant component of artisanal and commercial fisheries across its range. Off northern Australia, it ranks among the most common sharks caught in trawls, and comprises 2% and 6% of the annual gillnet and <b>longline</b> catches, respectively. This species {{is also one of}} the most commercially important sharks caught off Senegal, Mauritania, Oman, and India. Some sport fishers regard it as a game fish.|$|E

5|$|Type D was {{identified}} based on photographs of a 1955 mass stranding in New Zealand and six at-sea sightings since 2004. The first video record {{of this type}} in life happened between the Kerguelen and Crozet Islands in 2014. It is immediately recognizable by its extremely small white eye patch, narrower and shorter than usual dorsal fin, bulbous head (similar to a pilot whale), and smaller teeth. Its geographic range appears to be circumglobal in subantarctic waters between latitudes 40°S and 60°S. And although nothing {{is known about the}} type D diet, it is suspected to include fish because groups have been photographed around <b>longline</b> vessels, where they reportedly prey on Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides).|$|E
5|$|While {{large enough}} to perhaps be dangerous, the bignose shark seldom comes into contact with humans due to its {{preference}} for deep water. This species is a bycatch of gillnet, bottom trawl, and deep-set pelagic <b>longline</b> fisheries (particularly those targeting tuna) {{in many parts of}} its range. It is regularly taken in Cuban waters and used to produce liver oil, shagreen, and fishmeal. Elsewhere, such as in Southeast Asia, the meat is consumed and the fins shipped to East Asia for shark fin soup. The bignose shark is not used commercially in United States, where it is listed as Prohibited Species under the 2007 Fishery Management Plan for Atlantic tunas, swordfish and sharks, or in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the sharptooth houndshark adapts well to captivity and {{has been}} {{displayed}} in public aquariums. It is frequently caught by recreational anglers from shore or ski-boats; it is edible but rarely eaten. Small numbers are also caught incidentally by a commercial demersal <b>longline</b> fishery targeting the school shark (Galeorhinus galeus) in the Gansbaai and False Bay region. The meat from sharks caught in the fishery is either made into biltong or jerky and sold locally, or exported fresh or frozen to Italy and Taiwan. Although in South Africa the sharptooth houndshark is listed as a noncommercial species and thus cannot be harvested commercially, it is often mistaken for the common smooth-hound (Mustelus mustelus) by fishers. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the sharptooth houndshark as Near Threatened. This species is highly susceptible to even moderate levels of fishing pressure, due to its restricted range, slow growth rate, and low fecundity. The fact that most sharks caught by fishers are immature is an additional source of concern.|$|E
40|$|The Tristan da Cunha {{group of}} islands consist {{of the main}} island of Tristan da Cunha, and three outer islands – Gough, Nightingale and Inaccessible. Fishing at the outer islands uses two methods – <b>longlining</b> and powerboats – {{although}} <b>longlining</b> is the predominant method. Fishing around Tristan is normally by powerboats only. Fishing data are recorded differently for the outer islands and for Tristan, and are thus treated separately...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Longlining</b> - is a {{commercial}} technique {{that uses a}} long heavy fishing line {{with a series of}} hundreds or even thousands of baited hooks hanging from the main line by means of branch lines called [...] "snoods". <b>Longlines</b> are usually operated from specialised boats called longliners. They use a special winch to haul in the line, and can operate in deeper waters targeting pelagic species such as swordfish, tuna, halibut and sablefish.|$|R

5|$|Scientists and conservationists (most {{importantly}} BirdLife International {{and their}} partners, {{who run the}} Save the Albatross campaign) are working with governments and fishermen to find solutions to the threats albatrosses face. Techniques such as setting <b>longline</b> bait at night, dyeing the bait blue, setting the bait underwater, {{increasing the amount of}} weight on lines and using bird scarers can all reduce the seabird bycatch. For example, a collaborative study between scientists and fishermen in New Zealand successfully tested an underwater setting device for longliners which set the lines below the reach of vulnerable albatross species. The use of some of these techniques in the Patagonian toothfish fishery in the Falkland Islands is thought to have reduced the number of black-browed albatross taken by the fleet in the last 10 years. Conservationists have also worked on the field of island restoration, removing introduced species that threaten native wildlife, which protects albatrosses from introduced predators.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the night shark globally as Vulnerable, citing its slow reproductive rate and historical declines under fishing pressure. It {{has also been}} listed as Vulnerable by the American Fisheries Society (AFS). This species was once {{a significant part of}} the Cuban artisanal shark fishery, comprising 6075% of the catch from 1937 to 1941, before its numbers dropped substantially in the 1970s. Similarly, the proportion of night sharks in the shark catch of the southeastern U.S. pelagic <b>longline</b> fishery fell from 26.1% from 1981 to 1983 to 0.33.3% in 1993 and 1994; a comparable decline was observed in catches by south Florida marlin tournaments since the 1970s. Currently, the intense Brazilian targeted fishery is of particular concern, although fishing pressure on the night shark may be relaxing as the fishery is beginning to shift towards swordfish and bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus). No fishery information on the night shark is available for the eastern Atlantic, leading to an IUCN assessment of Data Deficient for that region.|$|E
5|$|The {{black dogfish}} is {{harmless}} to humans and of little commercial value. Substantial numbers are caught incidentally by commercial deep-sea trawl, gillnet, and <b>longline</b> fisheries operating throughout the North Atlantic, including the Icelandic Greenland halibut fishery, the French mixed-species trawl fishery, and the Canadian Greenland halibut, crab, redfish, monkfish, and witch fisheries. Captured sharks are usually discarded, though {{in recent years}} this and other small deepwater sharks have been increasingly retained and used for fishmeal. Reported catches by European countries, of which France made the largest contribution, have followed a declining trend from 486 tons in 2001 to 35 tons in 2006. The average catch by Canadian fisheries was 68 tons per year from 1996 to 2005. The black dogfish occurs mostly too deep for fisheries off southern Africa; {{in the remainder of}} its range, little information is available on fishery impact.|$|E
