5|$|The {{lagomorphs}} comprise two families, <b>Leporidae</b> (hares and rabbits), and Ochotonidae (pikas). They can resemble rodents, but {{differ in}} a number of physical characteristics, such as having four incisors in the upper jaw rather than two.|$|E
5|$|The Ethiopian hare (Lepus fagani) is {{a species}} of mammal in the family <b>Leporidae.</b> It was first {{described}} in 1903, by the British mammologist Oldfield Thomas. The dorsal pelage is brownish buff, and is finely grizzled with black. The ventral pelage is fluffy and white in colour. Endemic to Africa, it {{is found in the}} Afromontane Biozone of Ethiopia, and in the borders of the Sudanian Savanna Biozone. It is rated as a data deficientspecies by theInternational Union for Conservation of Nature.|$|E
5|$|The Ethiopian {{highland}} hare (Lepus starcki) is {{a medium-sized}} species of mammal in the rabbit and hare family, <b>Leporidae.</b> Its dorsal pelage is grizzled, buff white and spotted and streaked with black, while its belly fur is pure white and fluffy. It is endemic to the Ethiopian Highlands, ranging over the Afroalpine {{regions of the}} Shoa, Bale, and Arsi Provinces of Ethiopia. A herbivore, it mostly feeds on moorland grasses. The IUCN rates it as a species of least concern.|$|E
50|$|Other names {{used for}} this order, now {{considered}} synonymous, include: Duplicidentata - Illiger, 1811; <b>Leporida</b> - Averianov, 1999; Neolagomorpha - Averianov, 1999; Ochotonida - Averianov, 1999; and Palarodentia - Haeckel, 1895.|$|R
5|$|The Natal {{red rock}} hare or greater red rock hare (Pronolagus crassicaudatus) is {{a species of}} mammal in the family <b>Leporidae</b> (rabbits and hares). It has a {{slightly}} grizzled, grayish brown head and reddish brown upperparts.The dense fur is thick and rougher than other rock hares. It is endemic to Africa, and found in southeastern provinces of South Africa (Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga, and KwaZulu-Natal), eastern Lesotho, Swaziland (Highveld and Lumbobo), and southern Mozambique (Maputo Province). It is aherbivore, primarily feeding on grass. It breeds throughout the year, {{and one or two}} pups are usually born in the summer. It is rated as a species ofleast concernon theIUCN Red Listof Endangered Species.|$|E
5|$|The Yunnan hare (Lepus comus) is a {{medium-sized}} species of mammal {{in the family}} <b>Leporidae.</b> It has soft, flat, and long dorsal pelage which is grayish brown or dark gray in color, and whitish ventral pelage. It was considered endemic to China (mainly in Yunnan), but its presence was recorded in northern Myanmar in 2000. It is an herbivore, and forages on shrubs and forbs. It is rated as a species ofleast concernon the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red Listof Endangered Species. The Red List of China's Vertebrates has listed the Yunnan hare as near threatened, almost meeting the criteria to be listed as vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|Lundy {{is home to}} {{an unusual}} range of mammals, almost all introduced, {{including}} a distinct breed of wild pony, the Lundy pony. Until recently, Lundy and the Shiant Isles in the Hebrides {{were the only two}} places in the UK where the black rat (Rattus rattus) could be found regularly. In the rest of the United Kingdom they have largely been replaced by brown rats except for occasional sightings in port towns and the Thames Estuary. It has since been eradicated on the island, {{in order to protect the}} nesting seabirds. Other species which have made the island their home include the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus), Sika deer (Cervus nippon), pygmy shrew (Sorex minutus) and feral goats (Capra aegagrus hircus). Unusually, 20% of the rabbits (<b>Leporidae)</b> on the island are melanistic compared with 4% which is typical in the UK. In mid-2006 the rabbit population was devastated by myxomatosis, leaving only 60 pairs from the previous 15–20,000 individuals. Soay sheep (Ovis aries) on the island have been shown to vary their behaviours according to nutritional requirements, the distribution of food and the risk of predation.|$|E
25|$|Some animals develop {{only one}} set of teeth (monophyodont) while others develop many sets (polyphyodont). Sharks, for example, grow {{a new set of}} teeth every two weeks to replace worn teeth. Rodent incisors grow and wear away {{continually}} through gnawing, which helps maintain relatively constant length. The industry of the beaver {{is due in part to}} this qualification. Many rodents such as voles and guinea pigs, but not mice, as well as <b>leporidae</b> like rabbits, have continuously growing molars in addition to incisors.|$|E
500|$|The Ethiopian hare is {{a species}} of the family <b>Leporidae,</b> and has no {{recognized}} subspecies. It belongs to the subgenus Sabanalagus. It was first described in 1903, by the British mammologist Oldfield Thomas in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London. He named it Lepus fagani, after Charles E. Fagan, who was the Assistant Secretary of the British Museum of Natural History. Describing the hare's taxonomy in 1986, Derek Yalden and colleagues wrote [...] "its nomenclatural history has been very confused".|$|E
500|$|The Yarkand hare (Lepus yarkandensis) is {{a species}} of mammal in the family <b>Leporidae.</b> It has soft, straight, sandy brown dorsal pelage which has grayish black stripes, and {{completely}} white ventral pelage. Endemic to China, the Yarkand hare is restricted to the Tarim Basin in Southern Xinjiang, China. It is mainly nocturnal, and forages on grass and crops. The female produces two or three litters annually, each consisting of two to five young. It is rated as near threatened on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Endangered Species and by the Red List of China's Vertebrates. [...] However, Chinese geneticists have stated the species is [...] "endangered" [...] due to limited habitat and its fragmentation, and over-hunting and poaching.|$|E
2500|$|The family <b>Leporidae</b> (rabbits and hares) {{is easily}} the most {{significant}} prey group, comprising about 32% of prey known to be taken by golden eagles. Twelve out of sixteen dietary studies in North America showed leporids as the most common prey group, in some areas comprising over 75% of prey remains. In the northern Rocky Mountains and Northern Plains areas, the main prey species are the white-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus townsendii) and the mountain cottontail (Sylvilagus nuttallii). In the Southwest, the Great Basin, and most of California, the main prey species are the black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus) and the desert cottontail (Sylvilagus audubonii), the former being especially important, comprising {{about a quarter of}} North America prey items in a 1976 study. In two studies in southern Idaho, the black-tailed jackrabbit and the two cottontails dominated the diet, comprising over 70% of nest remains. [...] More locally other jackrabbits and cottontails may be taken in smaller numbers. The snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) is thought to be the dominant prey species in the boreal forests of Canada but there have been no dietary studies conducted there. The snowshoe and the larger Arctic hare (Lepus arcticus) {{are some of the most}} significant prey species in Alaska, though in one central Alaskan nest they were secondary to ptarmigan and nests in Denali National Park included only 0.4% leporid remains. Nests in Alberta and Washington had almost no leporid remains as well.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Leporidae</b> is {{a family}} of mammals that include rabbits and hares, over 60 species in all. The Latin word <b>Leporidae</b> means [...] "those that {{resemble}} lepus" [...] (hare). Together with the pikas, the <b>Leporidae</b> constitute the mammalian order Lagomorpha. <b>Leporidae</b> differ from pikas in that they have short, furry tails and elongated ears and hind legs.|$|E
