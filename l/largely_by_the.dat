5|$|Like all animal heads, {{the head}} of a {{butterfly}} or moth contains the feeding organs and the major sense organs. The head typically consists of two antennae, two compound eyes, two palpi and a proboscis. Lepidoptera have ocelli {{which may or may not}} be visible. They also have sensory structures called chaetosemata, the functions of which are largely unknown. The head is filled <b>largely</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> brain, the sucking pump and its associated muscle bundles. Unlike the adults, the larvae have one-segmented mandibles.|$|E

5|$|As noted above, most DNA {{molecules}} {{are actually}} two polymer strands, bound {{together in a}} helical fashion by noncovalent bonds; this double-stranded (dsDNA) structure is maintained <b>largely</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> intrastrand base stacking interactions, which are strongest for G,C stacks. The two strands can come apart– {{a process known as}} melting– to form two single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules. Melting occurs at high temperature, low salt and high pH (low pH also melts DNA, but since DNA is unstable due to acid depurination, low pH is rarely used).|$|E
5|$|Black American Sign Language (BASL) or Black Sign Variation (BSV) is a dialect of American Sign Language (ASL) {{used most}} {{commonly}} by deaf African Americans in the United States. The divergence from ASL was influenced <b>largely</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> segregation {{of schools in}} the American South. Like other schools at the time, schools for the deaf were segregated based upon race, creating two language communities among deaf signers: White deaf signers at White schools and Black deaf signers at Black schools. Today, BASL is still used by signers in the South despite public schools having been legally desegregated since 1954.|$|E
5|$|England under Henry IV {{was also}} looking {{to develop a}} silk industry, but no {{opportunity}} arose until the revocation of the Edict of Nantes the 1680s, when {{hundreds of thousands of}} French Huguenots, many of whom were skilled weavers and experts in sericulture, began immigrating to England to escape religious persecution. Some areas, including Spitalfields saw many high-quality silk workshops spring up, their products distinct from continental silk <b>largely</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> colors used. Nonetheless, the British climate prevented England's domestic silk trade from becoming globally dominant.|$|E

Iskras base was moved from Munich to London and then to Geneva, each time accompanied by Lenin. At the party's second congress, held in London in 1902, a major schism erupted between Lenin and his supporters (the Bolsheviks) and Julius Martov and his supporters (the Mensheviks); Lenin emphasised a strongly centralised party controlled <b>largely</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> leadership, whereas Martov accepted a wider party with more independence of thought. Lenin returned to Russia briefly during the Revolution of 1905, but fled again when the Tsarist authorities defeated the revolutionary forces and cracked down on dissent.|$|E
5|$|The phase {{behavior}} of lipid bilayers is determined <b>largely</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{strength of the}} attractive Van der Waals interactions between adjacent lipid molecules. Longer-tailed lipids have more area over which to interact, increasing {{the strength of this}} interaction and, as a consequence, decreasing the lipid mobility. Thus, at a given temperature, a short-tailed lipid will be more fluid than an otherwise identical long-tailed lipid. Transition temperature can also be affected by the degree of unsaturation of the lipid tails. An unsaturated double bond can produce a kink in the alkane chain, disrupting the lipid packing. This disruption creates extra free space within the bilayer that allows additional flexibility in the adjacent chains. An example of this effect can be noted in everyday life as butter, which has a large percentage saturated fats, is solid at room temperature while vegetable oil, which is mostly unsaturated, is liquid.|$|E
5|$|This period {{also saw}} a {{significant}} expansion in Georgia Tech's postgraduate education programs, driven <b>largely</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Cold War and the launch of Sputnik; this effort received substantial support from the EES. Despite its slow start, with the first Master of Science programs in the 1920s and the first Doctorate in 1946, the program became firmly established. In 1952 alone, around 80 students earned graduate degrees while working at EES. Herschel H. Cudd, EES director from 1952 to 1954, created a new promotion system for researchers that is still in use. Many EES researchers held the title of professor despite lacking a doctorate (or a comparable qualification for promotion {{as determined by the}} Georgia Board of Regents), something that irritated members of the teaching faculty. The new system, approved in spring 1953, used the Board of Regents' qualifications for promotion and mirrored the academic tenure track.|$|E

5|$|After Árbenz's resignation, {{his family}} {{remained}} for 73 {{days at the}} Mexican embassy in Guatemala City, which was crowded with almost 300 exiles. During this period, the CIA initiated {{a new set of}} operations against Árbenz, intended to discredit the former president and damage his reputation. The CIA obtained some of Árbenz's personal papers, and released parts of them after doctoring the documents. The CIA also promoted the notion that individuals in exile, such as Árbenz, should be prosecuted in Guatemala. When they were finally allowed to leave the country, Jacobo Árbenz was publicly humiliated at the airport when the authorities made the former president strip before the cameras, claiming that he was carrying jewelry he had bought for his wife, María Cristina Villanova, at Tiffany's in New York City, using funds from the presidency; no jewelry was found but the interrogation lasted for an hour. Through this entire period, coverage of Árbenz in the Guatemalan press was very negative, influenced <b>largely</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> CIA's campaign.|$|E
5|$|During {{his playing}} career, Martin greatly {{influenced}} {{the evolution of}} the sport of curling into a competitive sport. He was an instrumental part of the group that brought about the Grand Slam of Curling. In the early 2000s, he became the spokesperson for the promotion of the financial growth of curling, represented <b>largely</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> World Curling Tour, which was growing in popularity due to the benefits afforded by corporate sponsorship opportunities and cash prizes at tournaments. The Martin-led boycott of the Canadian Curling Association for its refusal to allow the developments in the World Curling Tour to be mirrored in the Brier catalyzed not only the transformation of the Brier, but also the growth of the Grand Slam, and in doing so, ultimately allowed the sport of curling to become a legitimate spectator sport. The development of the competitive tier of the sport also marked a change in both the players of the sport and the sport itself, as evidenced by improvements in the development and training of curlers as athletes and improvements in the quality of curling games due to better ice conditions and precision-based gameplay.|$|E
5|$|Nefarious {{asserts that}} there is a link between the {{international}} sex industry and legal prostitution in the Western world, and that those who create the demand for forced prostitution around the world are {{of a wide variety of}} ages and are often considered respectable. The film contrasts the secretiveness and brutality of the sex industry in Eastern Europe with the openness of public prostitution in the Netherlands. Nefarious suggests that sex trafficking in Southeast Asia is fuelled <b>largely</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> complicity of the victims' parents, with many in Cambodia grooming and then knowingly selling their daughters into prostitution to pay for luxury goods. The film asserts that 10% of the population of Moldova has been sexually trafficked. Nefarious contrasts Las Vegas prostitutes with victims of sex trafficking in Europe, depicting the former as drawn into the sex industry by dreams of a glamorous lifestyle, and the latter as made vulnerable by child abandonment and orphanages.|$|E

5|$|Lieutenant Commander Eugene Esmonde, {{acting as}} Squadron Leader, No. 825 Squadron FAA {{took off with}} his Fairey Swordfish {{formation}} at 12:25 to attack the ships. No. 411 and 64 Squadron were to escort the FAA but arrived over Manston 15 minutes late and missed the rendezvous. The only unit to keep to mission orders was Squadron Leader Brian Kingcome's No. 72 Squadron. Unaware of the Swordfish squadron's location, they ran into each other by fortunate accident. Owing to low cloud cover, they dropped to between 50 and 100 feet. The heavy German fighter cover {{put an end to}} the protection the Spitfire's could provide as the RAF fighters now had to look after themselves. The Spitfires and Swordfish were engaged by Fw 190s of 8 staffel and 9 staffel./JG 26 led by Gruppenkommandeur (Group Commander) Gerhard Schöpfel of III./JG 26. The Fw 190s were just relieving fighters of JG 2. Frail and slow, the Swordfish forced German pilots to lower their undercarriages to prevent overshooting the biplanes. In the event all six Swordfish were shot down. The Spitfires destroyed three Fw 190s in return. Several Swordfish managed to fire off their torpedoes but none found their mark. Lieutenant Commander Esmonde was shot down and killed by an Fw 190. He was awarded the Victoria Cross. Only five of the original eighteen Swordfish crew survived. No. 41 Squadron RAF claimed three Bf 109s (most likely from JG 1) destroyed and one damaged off the Belgian coast. No. 72 Squadron claimed three Fw 190s destroyed and four damaged in the battles around 13:00. No. 410 Squadron claimed two Bf 109s destroyed and two damaged in the same dogfights. The German ships consumed very little ammunition, as the action had been carried out <b>largely</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|The tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are {{typically}} fringed with tentilla ("little tentacles"), {{although a few}} genera have simple tentacles without these sidebranches. The tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it. Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis, and have three main components: a domed head with vesicles (chambers) that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and {{is attached to the}} head and to the root of the stalk. The function of the spiral thread is uncertain, but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape, and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart. In addition to colloblasts, members of the genus Haeckelia, which feed mainly on jellyfish, incorporate their victims' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles – some cnidaria-eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense. The tentilla of Euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids: they contain striated muscle, a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora; and they are coiled when relaxed, while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed. Euplokamis tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey: they may flick out very quickly (in 40 to 60milliseconds); they can wriggle, which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms; and they coil round prey. The unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle. The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles, but of a highly specialized type. Coiling around prey is accomplished <b>largely</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> return of the tentilla to their inactive state, but the coils may be tightened by smooth muscle.|$|E
