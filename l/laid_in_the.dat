5|$|Following the execution, Riel's {{body was}} {{returned}} to his mother's home in St. Vital, where it lay in state. On 12 December 1886, his remains were <b>laid</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> churchyard of the Saint-Boniface Cathedral following the celebration of a requiem mass.|$|E
5|$|In 1916 mines were <b>laid</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{vicinity}} of the rock by the German submarines SM U-71 and SM U-78. In July 1940 during World War II a stick of bombs was dropped by a passing German plane. The explosion cracked two lantern panes and shattered one of the incandescent mantles.|$|E

25|$|Ashley Park Golf Club was <b>laid</b> out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1890s, but {{ceased to}} exist prior to 1918. Burwood Park Golf Club was <b>laid</b> out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1890s <b>in</b> <b>the</b> half-century-old {{breakaway}} bounds of Hersham, and continues.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> {{addition}} to <b>the</b> requirements <b>laid</b> out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> regulations {{the client and}} principal contractor must, so far as is reasonably practicable, comply {{with a number of}} additional duties <b>laid</b> out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> schedule to the regulations.|$|R
5|$|Federal Hill is made {{primarily}} of brick fired on-site and <b>laid</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Flemish bond pattern. The mansion possesses a foundation crafted of limestone {{native to the}} surrounding countryside. The windowsills and mantels were finely carved by a free black craftsman. The mansion is designed in the Federal Style. Federal Hill has three floors traversed by a staircase located within a central hallway on each floor and an English basement. The first floor's main rooms are a dining room, parlor, and library. The second floor consists of three bedrooms similarly spaced to the rooms below.|$|E
5|$|Network {{synthesis}} filters. The mathematical {{bases of}} network synthesis were <b>laid</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1930s and 1940s. After {{the end of}} World War II network synthesis became the primary tool of filter design. Network synthesis put filter design on a firm mathematical foundation, freeing it from the mathematically sloppy techniques of image design and severing the connection with physical lines. The essence of network synthesis is that it produces a design that will (at least if implemented with ideal components) accurately reproduce the response originally specified in black box terms.|$|E
5|$|Rakoto Frah died on 29 September 2001 in the Ravoahangy Andrianavalona {{hospital}} of Antananarivo following heart problems and a lung infection. In {{the days following}} his death, the Malagasy government organized a public celebration in his honor at Mahamasina stadium. His body was <b>laid</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> family tomb in his home village of Ankadinandriana on 3October.|$|E

5|$|The {{bodies of}} Warwick and Montagu {{were laid out}} 'on the morrow after' and 'openly shewed and naked' in St. Paul's, to prevent rumour {{starting}} that they had in fact survived the battle; Warkworth too said that the King personally directed this, and arranged for the corpses 'to {{be put in a}} cart... to be <b>laid</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> church of Paul's, on the pavement, that every man might see them; and so they lay for three or four days' before granting permission to their brother George for their burial at Bisham Priory.|$|E
5|$|The {{cattle egret}} engages in {{low levels of}} brood parasitism, {{and there are a}} few {{instances}} of cattle egret eggs being <b>laid</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nests of snowy egrets and little blue herons, although these eggs seldom hatch. There is also evidence of low levels of intraspecific brood parasitism, with females laying eggs in the nests of other cattle egrets. As much as 30% extra-pair copulations have been noted.|$|E
5|$|Western jackdaws hatch asynchronously and {{incubation}} begins before clutch completion, {{which often}} leads {{to the death of}} the last-hatched young. If the supply of food is low, parental investment in the brood is kept to a minimum as little energy is wasted on feeding a chick that is unlikely to survive. Replacement clutches are very rarely <b>laid</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> event of clutch failure.|$|E

5|$|After {{conferring with}} the chief {{engineers}} of the Second and Third field armies, Shazly became aware that IAF, despite heavy losses, had destroyed so many bridge sections that the Egyptians had lost the equivalent of three heavy bridges, leaving four bridges in reserve along with the five already <b>laid</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> canal. This gave rise to concerns about supply {{in the coming days}} and weeks. Shazly then discussed the possibility of constructing three bridges in the canal using earth and sand. This would make causeways impregnable against air strikes and artillery. The chief engineer of the Third Army, with whom he discussed the idea, was confidant that, given enough bulldozers, the causeways could be constructed in one week.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the South Lake Union {{neighborhood}} of Seattle, located {{to the north}} of downtown and east of the Seattle Center, was a manufacturing district whose electrical power was supplied by the Broad Street Substation. After the failure of the Seattle Commons plan in the 1990s, which proposed a large city park over the neighborhood, the land was opened for development by Paul Allen's Vulcan Real Estate, which envisioned it as a hub for biotech and high tech firms. Vulcan and Seattle City Light began talks of collaborating to build a $160 million substation in Interbay or South Lake Union in 2003, expecting the additional high tech firms to put a strain on the Broad Street substation and neighborhood lines <b>laid</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 2000s. In 2005, Seattle City Light determined that adding capacity at the Broad Street substation through new transformer banks would be sufficient for the area's needs until the mid-2010s.|$|E
5|$|Laying pipe {{took several}} stages. First, {{the right of}} way had to be cleared with chainsaws, bulldozers, and {{scrapers}} who followed the rough route laid out by the initial surveyors. These crews were followed by another group of surveyors and engineers who determined whether the pipeline could be <b>laid</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> planned spot, or if it had to be moved because of permafrost, soft ground, or other considerations. State and federal surveillance officers, working with the engineers, could give the OK to move the path of the pipeline as much as 200 feet to the right or left in order to avoid obstacles.|$|E

5|$|The cruiser then {{returned}} to the Rufiji River so work could begin on overhauling her engines; the parts would need to be transported overland to the shipyard in Dar es Salaam where they could be rebuilt. While moored in the town of Salale, the ship was heavily camouflaged and defensive arrangements were erected. These included positioning soldiers and field guns to defend the approaches to the cruiser and establishing a network of coast watchers and telegraph lines to watch for hostile ships. An improvised minefield was also <b>laid</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> delta to keep the British ships from entering the river.|$|E
5|$|The eggs may be {{deposited}} singly or {{in small}} groups, or may {{take the form of}} spherical egg masses, rafts or long strings. In terrestrial caecilians, the eggs are laid in grape-like clusters in burrows near streams. The amphibious salamander Ensatina attaches its similar clusters by stalks to underwater stems and roots. The greenhouse frog (Eleutherodactylus planirostris) lays eggs in small groups in the soil where they develop in about two weeks directly into juvenile frogs without an intervening larval stage. The tungara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus) builds a floating nest from foam to protect its eggs. First a raft is built, then eggs are <b>laid</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> centre, and finally a foam cap is overlaid. The foam has anti-microbial properties. It contains no detergents but is created by whipping up proteins and lectins secreted by the female.|$|E
5|$|The main display map of {{the game}} is focused on Cyrenaica, a {{representation}} of the Allied minefield that was <b>laid</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gazala Line between Gazala and Bir Hachieim. The Axis troops begin the game on the western side of the line, whilst Allied forces begin the offensive in British Egypt. A command box in the game provides the player with an instant report of a unit or landscape once hovered over; data given on units includes their strength in terms of supply of infantry, provisions, artillery, and the number of moves that unit can make on one turn. Every two turns lasts one in-game day and units are available to enter combat phases once a day is finished.|$|E

5|$|These sparrows feed {{primarily}} on {{seeds in the}} winter and insects in the spring and summer. The birds are often territorial, with males guarding their territory through song and displays. Flight is awkward for this species, which prefers to hop along the ground for locomotion. They are monogamous and breed during spring. Two to five eggs are <b>laid</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bird's nest, which is cup-shaped and well hidden. Adult sparrows are preyed upon by house cats and small raptors, while young may be taken by a range of mammals and reptiles. They have been known to live for up to three years, two months. Although the species has been classified as least concern, or unthreatened with extinction, some subspecies are threatened by habitat destruction and one may be extinct.|$|E
5|$|To {{strengthen}} the defence further, by 1881, mines were <b>laid</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> waters {{between the two}} forts and the eastern entrance of the harbour. The mines were tethered to the seabed but floated dangerously {{under the surface of}} the water unseen to any enemy marine vessels. To enable safe passage of ships, a 'friendly safe channel' was created through the minefields. The work involved in the laying of minefields under the narrow channel (just 240 m apart) had actually led to rumours that tunnels running under the channels were constructed to link the two forts. There are, however, no archival records to prove that these tunnels were ever constructed.|$|E
5|$|With {{permission}} granted, {{the groundbreaking}} ceremony {{took place on}} the last day of Hanukkah of 1855. On April 22, 1856, the cornerstone was <b>laid</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem, Shmuel Salant. Salant had been instrumental in raising the necessary funding, making a trip to Europe in 1860 and obtaining large donations, especially from Montefiore. Some of the stones used in construction of the building was purchased from the Industrial Plantation, where poor Jews assisted in quarrying and shaping the blocks. On May 7, 1856 Consul Finn inspected the site after receiving complaints from Muslims who suspected the opening of windows towards a mosque.|$|E
