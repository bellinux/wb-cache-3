The Bundesverfassungsgericht (Federal Constitutional Court) is the German Supreme Court responsible for constitutional matters, with power of judicial review. Germany's supreme court system, called Oberste Gerichtshöfe des Bundes, is specialised: for civil and criminal cases, the highest court of appeal is the inquisitorial Federal Court of Justice, and for other affairs the courts are the Federal <b>Labour</b> <b>Court,</b> the Federal Social Court, the Federal Finance Court and the Federal Administrative Court.|$|E

25|$|In 1988 a new Labour Relations Act placed {{restrictions}} on labour activities, including giving the <b>Labour</b> <b>Court</b> {{the power to}} ban lawful strikes and lock-outs. This was to be short-lived, and negotiations between COSATU, NACTU and the South African Committee on Labour Affairs (SACCOLA) eventually produced a 1991 amendment which effectively repealed the previous powers.|$|E
25|$|Trade {{unions are}} {{recognized}} within the 1996 Constitution of South Africa, which {{provides for the}} right to join trade unions, and for unions to collectively bargain and strike. This has translated into the Labour Relations Act which established the working framework for both unions and employers. Three institutions have also been created to further the goals of reducing industrial relations conflict, and both eliminating unfair discrimination and redressing past discrimination in the workplace: the National Economic Development and Labour Council (NEDLAC), the <b>Labour</b> <b>Court,</b> and the Council for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA).|$|E

The dispute is resolved by a judgment only if conciliation cannot be achieved by the court. Judges are not professionals; they are elected by their peers, with an even number of judges.

40|$|The highly {{controversial}} debate in Germany {{on the relationship}} between labour law and labour market has put <b>labour</b> <b>courts</b> in the front line of criticism. They are being blamed mainly for cultivating a fanciful and biased making of law in favour of dismissed employees rendering the outcome of dismissal decisions for employers unforeseeable and, due to the allegedly almost automatic attribution of severance payments, unnecessarily expensive. Given these legals risks, critics argue, employers would refrain from recruiting new employees and would, therefore, not sufficiently contribute to the reduction of mass unemployment. Apart from the lack of any serious empirical confirmation for that hypothesis the critical perception eclipses important functions and effects of <b>labour</b> <b>courts</b> regarding employment and fairness conditions. On the basis of recent socio-legal research on <b>labour</b> <b>courts</b> and unfair dismissals the paper shall discuss some major findings and effects. The analysis shall start with (1) the contribution of <b>labour</b> <b>courts</b> to basic requirements of fairness in a modern labour society, discuss (2) fairness issues in dismissal cases brought before <b>labour</b> <b>courts,</b> describe and analyse (3) the opening of a judicially supervised floor in the court-room for dispute resolving negotiations and for achieving an amicable settlement, ask for the effects of the intervention of third parties (4) regarding the safeguard of procedural justice, and conclude with remarks (5) on the effects of rationalising human resources management and dismissal decisions by systematizing and communicating case-law regarding the termination of employment...|$|R

40|$|In Part 1 of {{this article}} {{the reasons for the}} {{establishment}} of specialist <b>labour</b> <b>courts</b> were explored, and the stages of development of the former industrial, and present <b>labour</b> <b>courts</b> were considered. However, as already pointed out, the drafters of the Constitution and the Labour Relations Act of 1995 (the “LRA”) had different goals in mind when creating the overall scheme of the courts respectively responsible for the adjudication of civil and constitutional matters and those in relation to labour matters. Ultimately, this prepared fertile ground for the superior courts to clash over the ultimate power to consider appeals in labour matters. Part 2 {{of this article}} explores the development of jurisprudence after the inception of the Constitution, which illustrates the gradual erosion of the <b>Labour</b> Appeal <b>Court’s</b> status in labour-related matters to the point where there is no logical reason for its continued existence.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} status of the <b>Labour</b> Appeal <b>Court</b> under South Africa's {{constitutional}} democracy. The stages of development of this country's labour laws have coincided with the establishment of new sets of labour dispute resolution fora : firstly, the Industrial Court; secondly, the <b>labour</b> <b>courts</b> under our present constitutional democracy; and thirdly, a yet to be implemented new dispute resolution paradigm under the proposed Superior Courts Bill. The focus of this contribution is on the influence of the provisions of the Constitution on these developments, and the gradual erosion of the exclusive appellate powers of the <b>Labour</b> Appeal <b>Court</b> by the Supreme Court of Appeal, and the Constitutional Court, in the assertion of their power to serve as highest <b>courts</b> in all <b>labour</b> matters.

40|$|The {{development}} of a corpus of fundamental rights at the EU level has accentuated the constitutional pluralism that existed within many national legal systems. Illustrating the dynamic, the adjudication of the age discrimination provisions of the 2000 Framework Directive on Employment Equality in Germany produced two major outcomes. First, interactions between the ECJ and the German <b>labour</b> <b>courts</b> served to upgrade rights protections afforded to workers, relative to national constitutional standards. Second, the structural position of the German Federal Constitutional Court, as a privileged locus of rights protection, was weakened, while {{the authority of the}} <b>labour</b> <b>courts</b> was enhanced. Looking head, we are entering a new era of rights-based legal integration that will further serve to Europeanize national law, while undermining the (supposed) unity and coherence of national legal orders...|$|R
