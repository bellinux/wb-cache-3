25|$|BOLD {{contrast}} {{depends on}} blood flow, {{which is both}} slowly changing and subject to noisy influences. Other biomarkers now looked at to provide better contrast include temperature, acidity/alkalinity (pH), calcium-sensitive agents, neuronal magnetic field, and the <b>Lorentz</b> <b>effect.</b> Temperature contrast depends on changes in brain temperature from its activity. The initial burning of glucose raises the temperature, and the subsequent inflow of fresh, cold blood lowers it. These changes alter the magnetic properties of tissue. Since the internal contrast is too difficult to measure, external agents such thulium compounds are used to enhance the effect. Contrast based on pH depends on changes in the acid/alkaline balance of brain cells when they go active. This too often uses an external agent. Calcium-sensitive agents make MRI more sensitive to calcium concentrations, with calcium ions often being the messengers for cellular signalling pathways in active neurons. Neuronal magnetic field contrast measures the magnetic and electric changes from neuronal firing directly. Lorentz-effect imaging tries to measure the physical displacement of active neurons carrying an electric current within the strong static field.|$|E

40|$|Neuronal current MRI (ncMRI) is a {{field of}} study to {{directly}} map electrical activity in the brain using MRI, which has many benefits over functional MRI. One potential ncMRI method, <b>Lorentz</b> <b>effect</b> imaging (LEI), has shown promise but needs a better theoretical understanding to improve its use. We develop three computational models to simulate the LEI experiments of an electrolyte filled phantom subject to a current dipole based on: ion flow, particle drift, and electromagnetohydrodynamics (EMHD). With comparative experimental results, we use the EMHD model {{to better understand the}} <b>Lorentz</b> <b>effect</b> over a range of current strengths. We also quantify the LEI experimental images and assess ways to measure the underlying current strength, which would greatly benefit comparative brain mapping. EMHD is a good predictor of LEI signal loss. We can measure the underlying current strength and polarity in the phantom using LEI images. We can also use trends from the EMHD model results to predict the required current density for signal detection in future LEI experiments. We can also infer the electric field strength, flow velocity, displacement, and pressure from the predicted current magnitude in an LEI experiment. The EMHD model provides information that greatly improves the utility and understanding of LEI. Future study with our EMHD model should be performed using shorter dipole lengths, higher density and lower strength of current sources, and varying current source frequencies to understand LEI in the setting of mapping brain activity.

The ability to detect and map neuronal currents in the brain is of great interest in understanding both health and diseases.

Investigations are currently underway to search for better contrast techniques that would allow researchers to directly detect neuronal currents. The focus of this research paper is to analyze the presently available contrast methods {{in their ability to}} directly detect neuronal currents.
