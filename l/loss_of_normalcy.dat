50|$|A major {{aspect of}} the French Revolution was the dechristianisation {{movement}}, a movement that many common people did not agree with. Especially for women living in rural areas of France, {{the demise of the}} Catholic Church meant a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>normalcy.</b> For instance, the ringing of Church bells resonating through the town called people to confession and was a symbol of unity for the community. With the onset of the dechristianisation campaign the Republic silenced these bells and sought simultaneously to silence the religious fervor of the majority Catholic population.|$|E
40|$|The {{adolescent}} life stage encompasses unique devel-opmental challenges. Little {{is known}} about the experi-ence of receiving a cancer diagnosis during this already demanding life stage. The aim {{of this study is to}} explore the lived experience of being diagnosed with cancer from the perspective of the adolescent. A phenomeno-logical approach is used to perform semistructured interviews with 10 adolescents who have been diag-nosed with cancer within the previous 4 to 6 months. Colaizzi’s method of analysis is used to allow themes to emerge from these data. Six themes capture the essence of being diagnosed with cancer from the perspective of the adolescent: (1) the stunning <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>normalcy,</b> (2) gaining information, (3) the importance of friends and their reactions, (4) getting used to it, (5) giving back...|$|E

The {{theme of}} loss is explored through the manuscript {{as the author}} delves into the family dynamics prior to a devastating car accident and the stark realities afterward.

Set in a post-WWII suburban community, the comparison of relative prosperity and the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>normalcy</b> are detailed.

40|$|This {{research}} paper aims to make meaning <b>of</b> <b>normalcy</b> in Ken Kesey’s novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. The meaning <b>of</b> <b>normalcy</b> is constructed from characters {{who are considered}} as not normal. Therefore, being not normal will be analyzed by Foucault’s idea of madness (1964) as the framework. In particular, the research analyzes textual evidences which indicate the aspects of madness. By employing a narrative approach in a qualitative method which emphasizes on {{the analysis of the}} characters in the novel, the finding reveals two main points. First, that normalcy means obedience. In this case, being obedient means being submissive toward the ward’s rules. Second, the idea <b>of</b> <b>normalcy</b> is determined by those who have power. From the analysis, it can be concluded that normalcy is not a fixed construction, it depends on those who hold the authority...|$|R
40|$|Research on online {{education}} {{in relation to}} disability has, importantly, focused on issues of access and usability. This article seeks to complicate this research by examining {{the ways in which}} {{online education}} participates in an ideology <b>of</b> <b>normalcy.</b> Toward this end, we first describe online education as a site that promotes normalcy through its material practices of marginalization. We then extend this reading by analyzing how cultural narratives about online education function asdiscursive sites <b>of</b> <b>normalcy</b> by marking both online education and its users as less-than substitutes for the "real" versions. By constructing online education as a prosthetic technology, these narratives persuade marginalized bodies to recognize themselves as problems in need of solution, yet this reading itself becomes open to revision when we consider how the complexities of embodiment challenge an understanding <b>of</b> <b>normalcy</b> as a determinate discursive force...|$|R
40|$|International {{actors have}} used {{multiple}} discursive frameworks for justifying interventions, from human {{security to the}} responsibility to protect, and, most recently, resilience-building. We argue that the language of normalization, hidden behind these narratives of interventions, has also contributed to structure the intervention landscape, albeit in less obvious and overt ways than other competing narratives of intervention. This article disentangles the different practices of normalization in order to highlight their ramifications. It introduces the concept of normal peace - a new conceptual reference to understand interventions undertaken {{by the international community}} to impose, restore or accept normalcy in turbulent societies. The article argues that the optimization of interventions entails selective responses to govern risk and adapt to the transitional international order. The art of what is politically possible underlines the choice of optimal intervention, be that to impose an external order <b>of</b> <b>normalcy,</b> restore the previous order <b>of</b> <b>normalcy,</b> or accept the existing order <b>of</b> <b>normalcy...</b>|$|R

This article attempts to mark the pervasiveness <b>of</b> <b>normalcy</b> in higher education by presenting findings from a systematic experience survey of disabled students and non-disabled students within one higher education institution in the United Kingdom. The findings indicate that disabled students who have institutional disability support express more difficulties in their learning and assessment than students with no known disability. However, {{it was found that}} {{there was no significant difference}} in academic achievement between the two cohorts of students. In relation to the latter point, the evidence also shows that disabled students who do not receive institutional disability support underperform...|$|R

It is argued that the event can be seen as aheterotopia, according to Michel Foucault a ‘counter-site’ enabling the resistance to authority, where the production <b>of</b> <b>normalcy</b> was challenged. Furthermore, even though the event happened spontaneously, the authors suggest that it can show a way towards a queer pedagogy for PE through teaching paradoxically; it indicates a preferred ethos of the lesson and the use of conceptual tools by teachers and students that make them able to intervene in the production <b>of</b> <b>normalcy...</b>|$|R
