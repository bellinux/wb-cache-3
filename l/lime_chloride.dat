30|$|The most polluting and oldest {{industry}} {{of the world}} is tanning industry. The demand for leather products is increasing with increasing population, thereby creating huge pollution load on the environment. The different processes associated with leather processing and finishing require huge amount of toxic chemicals, <b>lime,</b> <b>chloride</b> and the hides itself that contain huge amount of organic matter, protein and fats which contribute to the effluent when discharged into the environment (Altaf et al. 2008). Therefore, the most important challenge that scientists {{all over the world are}} facing is the treatment of tannery wastewater to make it reusable. Various methods have been explored for the treatment of tannery wastewater. The most conventional treatment option is biological treatment which has been successfully applied for many years (Vasudevan et al. 2012; Sivaprakasam et al. 2008). But due to the generation of large volume of sludge, this option has its own drawbacks. Apart from this, other processes like Fenton's and electro-oxidation (Rameshraja and Suresh 2011), photolytic and electrolytic oxidation (Anglada et al. 2009), ozonation (Dogruel et al. 2004), coagulation (Espinoza-Quinones et al. 2009), UV/H 2 O 2 (Rodrigues et al. 2008), etc. have been applied. Adsorbents prepared from natural materials have been used for the removal of chromium from tannery wastewater. The applicability of novel biosorbents had been studied for the removal of chromium from tannery wastewater (Chena et al. 2011; Bhattacharya et al. 2013). Membrane-based treatment of wastewater is being explored recently due to its efficiency and less generation of sludge. Membrane bioreactors are being widely used for the treatment of tannery and other wastewater (Cassano et al. 2001; Stephenson et al. 2000; Suthanthararajan et al. 2004.) Scholz et al. (2005) has studied the use of a membrane bioreactor for the removal of organic pollutants and suspended solids from tannery effluent and followed it up with the use of reverse osmosis. Goltara et al. (2009) studied membrane sequencing batch reactor for the treatment of beam house effluent. Use of a hybrid membrane bioreactor consisting of electro-coagulation, biological treatment and microfiltration was investigated for the removal of colour and chemical oxygen demand (COD) from tannery wastewater (Keerthi et al. 2013).|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to investigate effectiveness of salts used as an additive in lime-stabilized organic clay. Lime is known to be an effective stabilization method for clayey soil. However for organic clay it becomes less effective due to low increase in strength. Therefore salts are used to accelerate lime-organic clay reactions. Salts are introduced to remove the barrier in order to accelerate as well as help lime to increase the strength of soil. Two types of salts used are sodium chloride (NaCl) and calcium chloride (CaCl 2). The unconfined compressive test (UCT) is conducted on 108 remolded samples (38 mm x 80 mm) for 0, 7, 14 and 28 days of curing period. The test results indicated that when NaCl or CaCl 2 is added to the lime-organic clay mixture, the strength of mixture increases with increasing salt concentration. The strength of clay stabilized with <b>lime</b> and sodium <b>chloride</b> is higher than clay stabilized with <b>lime</b> and calcium <b>chloride</b> at a 10 % salt concentration.

Response to nitrogen addition was greatest on soils with low total nitrogen and high exchangeable calcium concentrations. Responses to <b>lime</b> and calcium <b>chloride</b> additions were greatest at sites with low foliar calcium and low soil pH.

40|$|Abstract—The most {{important}} nutrients in controlling water quality are: carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. They {{are essential to}} the growth of all living organisms. These are the nutritional pillars of bacteria, fish, trees and humans. Unfortunately, when a water body or plan becomes rich in these nutrients, particularly phosphorus, this causes some organisms such as algae to grow in abundance which makes the environment ugly. These algae are usually undesirable and may inevitably cause changes in pH, dissolved oxygen, colour and turbidity of the water environment, hence the environment becomes eutrophic and its color turns to green. To address and solve the eutrophication issue, the amount of phosphorus discharged into the receiving milieu must be reduced; and this constitutes the main purpose of our research. We proceeded so as to make a physico-chemical phosphorus removal from urban waste water. The physico-chemical treatment is based on looking for and finding the optimal dose of the various added coagulants. The aim of our work is to confirm the efficiency of the chemical treatment through use: <b>lime,</b> ferric <b>chloride</b> and aluminum sulfate as coagulant for this treatment.

Typically a bioretention cell is placed {{at the edge of a}} parking lot or effluent stormwater structure to capture stormwater runoff. The bioretention cell has limited treatment of phosphorous which can lead to eutrophication in receiving waters. To help with the uptake of phosphorous, drinking water treatment plant residuals (DWTRs) from Missouri were added to bioretention cell soil mixes. The DWTR is created when coagulant is added to the influent drinking water at the treatment plant. Flocs form and fall to the bottom of the clarifier.

Five soils (4 mineral and 1 organic) were selected to represent the range of chemical and physical properties typically found in agricultural soils in Ireland, and a 9 -mo incubation {{study was conducted to}} investigate the effectiveness of amending dairy cattle slurry with either alum, <b>lime,</b> poly-aluminum <b>chloride</b> (PAC), or ferric chloride (FeCl 3), in reducing water extractable P (WEP) levels in the soils. Alum, lime, and PAC were the most effective amendments in decreasing WEP (compared to a slurry-control) for the four mineral soils (up to 97 % 1 mo after application and by an average of 47 % at the end the 9 -mo incubation period). In comparison, FeCl 3 increased WEP (compared to the slurry-control) by an average of 35 % at the end the study. None of the amendments examined effectively reduced WEP of the organic soil. No amendment reduced soil test P (Morgan s P (Pm) and Mehlich- 3 P (M 3 P)) compared to the soil-only treatment. Therefore, amendment of dairy cattle slurry with alum, lime, and PAC can reduce the risk of chronic P loss in mineral soils without decreasing plant available P. Alum maintained the highest levels of M 3 P across the 4 mineral soils with the least risk of P loss to overlying water. With the exception of the soil-only treatment, there were significant positive relationships (p< 0. 05) between M 3 P and WEP for each treatment. Further work across a wider range of soil types and drainage regimes is required before recommendations can be made to farmers or catchment managers. Teagasc [Walsh Fellowship...|$|R
40|$|Application of {{lime and}} gypsum for {{alleviation}} of aluminum toxicity in acid soil, including potassium (K) fertilization, {{may interfere with}} the nutrient uptake of longkong (Aglaia dookkoo Griff.) trees. Threeexperiments were conducted to explore the possible problem of longkong soil. 1) Effect of lime and gypsum on growth and nutrient uptake of longkong seedling. 2) Effect of <b>lime</b> and potassium <b>chloride</b> on potassiumand magnesium uptake of longkong. 3) Relationship between potassium, calcium and magnesium in longkong leaves. The results showed that exchangeable aluminum in the soil decreased {{with the increase of}} Ca(OH) 2 treatment and the application of lime was more effective than that of the gypsum treatment. Theapplication of lime and gypsum tended to increase nutrient concentration in longkong, but did not affect the growth of longkong seedlings. The lime application on nutrient uptake of longkong seedlings decreased Kuptake; no lime and lime treatments were 863 and 720 mg tree- 1, while without K applied the per tree uptakes were 579 and 356 mg tree- 1 respectively. Besides the K application treatment reduced Ca and Mg uptake. Negative correlations between K and Ca (r = - 0. 532 **) and between K and Mg (r = - 0. 663 **) in leaves of 60 longkong trees in a farmer's orchard were found...|$|R
40|$|Lime {{stabilisation}} {{of organic}} clay {{has often been}} studied in the past. However, {{there is some evidence}} in the literature that the presence of high concentrations of organic matter in clay soil can lessen the chemical reaction between lime and clay minerals and can have detrimental effects on the engineering properties of soil. Hence, in this paper, the stress–strain behaviour and strength properties of organic soil treated with <b>lime</b> and sodium <b>chloride</b> (NaCl) are analysed. A soil mixture, prepared with 5 % lime content and 1 · 5 % humic acid, was stabilised with varying quantities of sodium chloride (0 · 5, 2 · 0 and 5 · 0 %). Consolidated undrained and drained triaxial tests were carried out on specimens at curing periods of 7 and 28 [*]d with applied confining pressures of 50 and 100 [*]kPa. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis were used to observe the microstructural changes resulting from cementation materials. It was found that the introduction of sodium chloride improved considerably the strength properties of the lime-treated organic clay. The microstructural analysis also confirmed the presence of calcium silicate hydrate in a salt-treated organic clay, which was the main contributing factor to the enhanced engineering properties of the clay...|$|R
