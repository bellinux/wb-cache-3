50|$|Chagas' disease's {{geographical}} occurrence happens worldwide but high-risk individuals {{include those}} who don't {{have access to}} proper housing. Its reservoir is in wild animals but its vector is a kissing bug. This is a contagious disease and can be transmitted {{through a number of}} ways: congenital transmission, blood transfusion, organ transplantation, consumption of uncooked food that has been contaminated with feces from infected bugs, and accidental <b>laboratory</b> <b>exposure.</b> The incubation period is five to fourteen days, after a host becomes in contact with feces. Chagas disease undergoes two phases which are the acute and chronic phase. The acute phase can last from two weeks to two months but can go unnoticed because symptoms are minor and short-lived. Symptoms of the acute phase include swelling, fever, fatigue, and diarrhea. The chronic phase causes digestive problems, constipation, heart failure, and pain in the abdomen. Diagnostic methods include microscopic examination, serology, or the isolation of the parasite by inoculating blood into a guinea pig, mouse, or rat. No vaccines are available but there are ways to be protected from this disease. Taking preventative measures such as applying bug repellent on the skin, wearing protective clothing, and staying in higher quality hotels—when traveling. Investing in quality housing would be ideal to decrease risk of contracting this disease. Consider installing plaster walls or new flooring to decrease the crevasses that bugs can hide in.|$|E

Agencies involved in producing policies surrounding biosafety within a hospital, pharmacy or clinical research laboratory include: the CDC, FDA, USDA, DHHS, DoT, EPA and potentially other local organizations including public health departments.

In addition to the CDC, the Environmental Protection Agency has some of the most accessible information on ecological impacts of biohazards, how to handle spills, reporting guidelines and proper disposal of agents dangerous to the environment. Many of these agencies have their own manuals and guidance documents relating to training and certain aspects of biosafety directly tied to their agency's scope, including transportation, storage and handling of blood borne pathogens.

40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanism}} of corrosion product flaking on bare copper sheet and three copper-based alloys in chloride rich environments has been explored through field and <b>laboratory</b> <b>exposures.</b> The tendency for flaking {{is much more}} pronounced on Cu and Cu– 4 wt%Sn than on Cu– 15 wt%Zn and Cu– 5 wt%Al– 5 wt%Zn. This difference is explained by the initial formation of zinc and zinc–aluminum hydroxycarbonates on Cu 15 Zn and Cu 5 Al 5 Zn, which delays the formation of CuCl, a precursor of Cu 2 (OH) 3 Cl. As a result, the observed volume expansion during transformation of CuCl to Cu 2 (OH) 3 Cl, and concomitant corrosion product flaking, is less severe on Cu 15 Zn and Cu 5 Al 5 Zn than on Cu and Cu 4 Sn...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} Cr(VI) {{pollution}} on the corrosion rate of corrugated iron roof samples collected from tanning industry areas was investigated through simulated <b>laboratory</b> <b>exposure</b> and spectrophotometric detection of Cr(III) deposit {{as a product}} of the reaction. The total level of Cr detected in the samples ranged from 113. 892 ± 0. 17 [*]ppm to 53. 05 ± 0. 243 [*]ppm and showed increasing trend as sampling sites get closer to the tannery and in the direction of tannery effluent stream. The <b>laboratory</b> <b>exposure</b> of a newly manufactured material to a simulated condition showed a relatively faster corrosion rate in the presence of Cr(VI) with concomitant deposition of Cr(III) under pH control. A significant (P = 0. 05) increase in the corrosion rate was also recorded when exposing scratched or stress cracked samples. A coupled redox process where Cr(VI) is reduced to a stable, immobile, and insoluble Cr(III) accompanying corrosion of the iron is proposed as a possible mechanism leading to the elevated deposition of the latter on the materials. In conclusion, the increased deposits of Cr detected in the corrugated iron roof samples collected from tanning industry zones suggested possible atmospheric Cr pollution as a factor to the accelerated corrosion of the materials...|$|E

40|$|The Antarctic {{silverfish}} Pleuragramma antarcticum {{is a key}} organism in {{the ecology}} of Southern Ocean. Eggs with fully developed yolk-sac embryos and newly hatched larvae have been recently observed {{to occur in the}} platelet ice accumulating below the sea-ice layer. This environment has strong pro-oxidant characteristics at the beginning of austral spring, when the rapid growth of algal ice communities, the massive release of nutrients and the photoactivation of dissolved organic carbon and nitrates, all represent important sources for oxyradical formation. Such processes are concentrated {{in a short period of}} a few weeks which overlaps with the final development of P. antarcticum in platelet ice. The aim of this work was to characterize the antioxidant system in embryos of P. antarcticum and the responsiveness toward the natural increase of pro-oxidant conditions in early spring. Considering the lack of ecotoxicological data on this species and its pivotal importance in the ecosystem of Southern Ocean, the sensitivity of its early life stages was also evaluated after <b>laboratory</b> <b>exposures</b> to environmentally relevant doses of benzo(a) pyrene, as a model chemical potentially released from anthropogenic activities. Obtained results revealed a marked temporal increase of antioxidants in embryos of P. antarcticum as adaptive counteracting responses to oxidative conditions of platelet ice. Particularly prompt responses were observed for glutathione metabolism which, however, did not prevent formation of increasing levels of lipid peroxidation products; from the analysis of total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC), the overall efficiency to neutralize peroxyl radicals remained almost constant while slightly lower TOSC values were obtained toward hydroxyl radicals at the end of sampling period. <b>Laboratory</b> <b>exposures</b> to 0. 5 - 5 mu g/ 1 BaP caused a significant accumulation of this PAH but no significant effects on the activity of cytochrome P 450.
