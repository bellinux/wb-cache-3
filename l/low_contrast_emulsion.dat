Development of this material is completely dry; it requires only applied heat. Special attention is focused on the Kalfax materials in regard to future military reconnaissance requirements of rapid in-flight processing and photographic materials that are immune to nuclear radiation. The Kalfax materials exhibit properties that fill many of these requirements. The information obtained from this investigation can be utilized for other applications where there is a need for a fast dry photographic process. A brief discussion of the Kalfax process is given to familiarize the reader with the light scattering technique to obtain optical density. The mechanics of using a photosensitive material in a polymeric vehicle to obtain the light scattering centers are explained. The striking differences between the nature of the Kalfax image and conventional silver image are discussed to enable understanding of different processes. The experimental procedure is outlined. A description of the equipment used for processing includes the sensitometer (exposing device) and the developer unit. Data is given for the ultraviolet sources used in the special sensitometers. The various types of heat sources that are useful for developing are examined. Several problems encountered in preliminary tests are described and analyzed. The major portion of this thesis is devoted to a detailed analysis of the photographic behavior of the Kalfax materials. The characteristic curves are given for the papers and films. A comparison is made between the high and <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> Kalfax <b>emulsions.</b> Sepsitometric quantities such as fog, gamma, relative speed, maximum density and exposure range are given for each material. Printing densities, as well as, ultra violet densities are measured for the films. The true specular densities were determined in addition to the diffuse densities so the Callier factors could be computed. Because of the unusual photosensitive process employed in forming an image with the Kalfax materials, speed shifts are encountered for long exposure times. An explanation of this effect in terms of diffusion properties is given along with the characteristic curves which show these effects. Other exposure effects such as reciprocity failure, development delay and clearing times are examined. A series of tests to determine the effect of pre- and post-sensitization are described and analyzed in regard to speed changes. The effects of varying the development temperature are discussed briefly. A comparison of the Kalfax materials with conventional silver halide materials is made. The Kalfax films are compared with Micro-File under the identical exposure conditions. The Micro-File was 2. 2 x 10 ^ 5 times faster than Kalfax film type 94 (high contrast). Kodak Azo printing paper is compared with Kalfax printing paper under the same exposure conditions and found to be 2. 88 x 10 ^ 4 times faster. The Kalfax materials are lacking in sensitivity but they can be completely processed in dry form in a matter of minutes in a normally illuminated room. This is one of the advantages to be considered in these materials. The use of Kalfax materials in aerial photography is limited at the present time because of the low sensitivity. Considerable theoretical and experimental work is required in order to realize the potential of the Kalfax materials. There is however, a definite use for the Kalfax materials in the reproduction field. An example of the use of Kalfax paper for reproduction is shown with an aerial photograph printed on Kalfax <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> paper from an aerial positive of scale 1 : 20, 000...|$|R

Unlike earlier studies, we compared contour interaction for high and <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> acuity targets using flankers at fixed angular separations, {{rather than at}} specific multiples of the acuity target’s stroke width. Percent correct letter identification was determined in 4 adult observers for computer generated, high and <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> dark Sloan letters surrounded by 4 equal contrast flanking bars. Two <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> targets were selected to reduce each observer’s visual acuity by 0. 2 and 0. 4 logMAR. The crowding functions measured for high and <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> letters are very similar when percent correct letter identification is plotted against the flanker separation in min arc. These results indicate that contour interaction of foveal acuity targets occurs within a fixed angular zone of a few min arc, regardless of the size or contrast of the acuity target...|$|R

Thresholding is the simplest approach to separate object from the background.

40|$|AbstractCan vision tests predict {{subsequent}} loss of acuity? The {{association between}} performance on several <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> spatial vision measures, glare recovery, color discrimination, flicker sensitivity, stereopsis and ocular disease status at baseline and acuity loss 4. 4 years later was examined {{in a large}} aged random sample with good initial acuity. In univariate analyses, several vision measures, retinal disease status and age were each significant predictors of subsequent acuity loss. In a multiple regression analysis, only <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> spatial vision was a significant predictor, but the other vision measures, retinal disease status and age were not. For each doubling of <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> spatial vision threshold at baseline, individuals were more than two {{times as likely to}} suffer subsequent significant visual acuity loss. Tests of <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> spatial vision are strong predictors of significant subsequent visual acuity loss. These findings have implications for clinical trials, clinical management, and acceptance of these measures into clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|Purpose:  To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} a customised manipulation of spherical aberration (SA) on the high and <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> visual acuities and contrast sensitivity of young adult myopes. Methods:  A placebo-controlled double masked trial of customised spherical aberration controlling soft contact lenses was undertaken in myopes aged 15 – 23. Participants wore customised soft contact lenses with either (i) zero spherical aberration or (ii) negative spherical aberration that resulted in a net SA (eye plus lens) of − 0. 1 micron. High and <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> log MAR visual acuities and Pelli Robson contrast sensitivity were assessed in 196 eyes of 98 subjects after a period of 12 months wearing the lenses. Results:  Both high and <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> acuities were significantly better in the group wearing the contact lenses with negative spherical aberration (high contrast log MAR, p = 0. 043; <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> log MAR, p = 0. 043) which was not due to differences in residual astigmatism or pupil size between the two groups. Pelli Robson contrast sensitivity was not significantly different in the two groups. Conclusions:  Manipulation of spherical aberration, taking account of the participants’ baseline level of aberration, can cause statistically significant improvements in high and <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> distance visual acuity although these improvements are too small in magnitude to be of clinical significance...|$|R

40|$|Multiple cell {{classes have}} been found in the primary visual cortex, but the {{relationship}} between cell types and spatial summation has seldom been studied. Parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons can be distinguished from pyramidal neurons based on their briefer action potential durations. In this study, we classified V 1 cells into fast-spiking units (FSUs) and regular-spiking units (RSUs) and then examined spatial summation at high and <b>low</b> <b>contrast.</b> Our results revealed that the excitatory classical receptive field and the suppressive non-classical receptive field expanded at <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> for both FSUs and RSUs, but the expansion was more marked for the RSUs than for the FSUs. For most V 1 neurons, surround suppression varied as the contrast changed from high to low. However, FSUs exhibited {{no significant difference in the}} strength of suppression between high and <b>low</b> <b>contrast,</b> although the overall suppression decreased significantly at <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> for the RSUs. Our results suggest that the modulation of spatial summation by stimulus contrast differs across populations of neurons in the cat primary visual cortex...|$|R
40|$|High-Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) is {{the newest}} video coding {{standard}} which can significantly reduce the bit rate by 50 % compared with existing standards. The key features and new tools in HEVC are designed for natural video sequences captured by a real camera. Different from natural videos, screen content contain much more edges in text and icon regions. The current video coding standards may blur or even remove <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> edges, which are very important in screen content for human eyes to recognize the character and the icon. Therefore, this paper proposes an effective modification on HEVC to preserve the <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> edges in screen content. First, discrete laplacian filter is adopted for edge detection, and then we adaptively adjust QPs for <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> edge regions, which can be detected based on our designed measurement for edge contrast. Experimental results show that nearly all the regions containing <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> edges can be detected, and the adjustment of QPs for these regions can greatly protect the edges with no RD performance reduction. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R

As DRRs are generated from CT scans, image quality may be affected by the scanning mode (axial or helical). The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the high and <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> resolution and the spatial linearity in DRRs as a function of CT scanning mode and to highlight the significance of this variation, if any. A commercial CT phantom (Fluke Biomedical Model 76 - 417) was scanned with a Siemens Somatom Sensation 4 CT scanner using six variations of field of view, scanning mode and helical pitch. The image quality of the DRR 2 ̆ 7 s produced from the scans was evaluated in terms of high contrast resolution using the modulation transfer function, <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> resolution using Image Quality Score method and spatial linearity. The results indicated that the high contrast resolution for the axial mode was comparable to that for the helical modes. The <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> resolution with axial scanning was comparable to scans performed with a helical pitch of 1 but deteriorated at pitches greater than 1. The field of view was not found to impact the <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> resolution. When changing scanning parameters the impact on DRR quality should be considered. For DRRs, particularly where visualisation of <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> structures is desired, a helical scan with a pitch of 1 is recommended...|$|R
40|$|The Multilook Cross Correlation (MLCC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{reliable}} algorithms used for Doppler ambiguity number estimation of the Doppler centroid parameter. However, the existing MLCC algorithm is only suitable for <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> scenes. In high contrast scenes, the estimated result is not reliable, and the error is unacceptable. Besides, the Doppler centroid estimation processing time is long and can only be used in offline processing. In this paper, we introduce a modified MLCC algorithm that has better sensitivity which is suitable not only for <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> scenes, but also for high contrast scenes. In addition, the modified MLCC algorithm can be implemented on parallel signal processing units for better time efficiency. Experiments with RADARSAT- 1 data show that the modified algorithm works well in both high and <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> scenes...|$|R

40|$|The {{dichotomy}} of contrastive and allophonic phonological relationships has {{a long-standing}} tradition in phonology, {{but there is}} growing research that points to phonological relationships that fall between contrastive and allophonic. Measures of lexical distinction (minimal pair counts) and predictability of distribution were applied to Laurentian French vowels to quantify three degrees of contrast between pairs: high, mid, and <b>low</b> <b>contrast.</b> According to traditional definitions, both the high and mid contrast pairs are classified as phonologically contrastive, and <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> pairs as allophonic. As such, a binary view of contrast (contrastive vs. non-contrastive) predicted that high and mid contrast pairs would pattern together on tasks of speech perception, and <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> pairs would show a different pattern. The gradient view predicted all vowel pairs would fall along a continuum. Thirty-two speakers of Laurentian French participated in two experiments: an AX task and a similarity rating task. The results did not support a strict binary interpretation of contrast, since the high, mid, and <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> vowel pairs pattern differently across the experiments. Instead, the results support a gradient view of phonological relationships.   This article {{is part of the}} special collection: Marginal Contrasts</a...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Wichita State University, Fairmount College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Dept. of PsychologyDriving is {{primarily}} a visual task that involves processing visual information over space and time (e. g., motion perception). Previous {{research has shown that}} such spatial and temporal processing becomes much more difficult under deteriorated conditions such as driving at night or in fog. One important research question is whether the deterioration associated with <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> scenes can be recovered though training. This dissertation aims to answer this question in two experiments by testing a theoretical framework of perceptual learning training, which is based on low level common mechanisms, on a steering control task. The first experiment examined whether a relationship exists between performances on 2 D and 3 D Coherent Motion tasks under <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> and a simulated steering control task under <b>low</b> <b>contrast.</b> The results from Experiment 1 demonstrates that performance on the Coherent Motion tasks, regardless of whether they are 2 D or 3 D displays, is able to predict certain performance measures of steering control. Then, Experiment 2 examined whether perceptual learning training utilizing the <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> Coherent Motion task has an effect on steering control performance under <b>low</b> <b>contrast.</b> After five hours of Coherent Motion training, participants significantly improved their squared coherency scores on the steering control task more than the control group, indicating an increase in steering stability and predictability. These results suggest that perceptual learning of a simple, low-level visual task can be transferred to a more complex task, which share a common low level mechanism...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{perceived}} {{speed of}} 1 c/deg sinusoidal gratings of contrast 0. 02 {{was measured in}} the presence of high contrast (0. 50) 1 c/deg sinusoidal gratings (called modifiers). The modifiers drifted or were counterphase modulated at various temporal frequencies. The presence of a modifier with temporal frequencies (0 and 3 Hz) lower than the <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> moving grating decreased its perceived speed while the presence of modifiers with higher temporal frequencies (8, 12 and 16 Hz) increased its perceived speed. A modifier of the same temporal frequency (6 Hz) as the standard grating had no effect upon the perceived speed of the <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> gratings. Moving modifiers are more effective than counterphase flickering modifiers in biasing the perceived speed of <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> gratings if they move {{in the same direction as}} the test grating and less effective if they move in the opposite direction. Finally, a modifier presented in an annulus surrounding the test grating is more effective than a modifier presented in a circular patch above or below the test grating in raising the perceived speed of <b>low</b> <b>contrast</b> gratings. This suggests that perceived speed depends on the ratio of low and high temporal frequency signals averaged over a significant area of the visual field. Copyright © 1996 Elsevier Science Lt...|$|R
