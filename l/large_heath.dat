500|$|In May 2007, the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) {{sought a}} state-level class action lawsuit against Burger King in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia over [...] the {{inclusion}} of trans-fats in foods served by Burger King and Burger King's failure to set a definitive time line for their elimination [...] from the company's menu. The CSPI suit sought to require the company to place <b>large</b> <b>heath</b> warnings on [...] Burger King's food packaging that explained the dangers of trans-fat and the levels of trans-fat contained in its products. Burger King sought to move {{the case to the}} Federal courts and have the suit dismissed. The Federal Court [...] denied the company's motion for dismissal and sent the case back to the Superior Court for trial. To address the CSPI's legal challenge, as well as several laws passed in New York City, Philadelphia and other cities regarding the issue of trans-fats in its food, BK announced a plan in July 2007 to phase out all trans-fats from its products by the end of 2008.|$|E

40|$|Director of the Digital Library Federation Program @ the Council on Library and Information Resources We talk a {{lot about}} {{community}} today. But do we really know what it takes to have a healthy, functioning community that encourages innovation, open to new ideas, and is tolerant and trusting? The success of libraries, and librarianship for that matter, has less to do about our grasp of technology and more about how we view ourselves, our professional mission, and how we choose to interact in the larger information network. The keynote will explore the concept of community and how our individual actions play into the <b>larger</b> <b>heath</b> of our profession...|$|R

40|$|HIGHLIGHTS • A major {{milestone}} {{was made}} {{as the number}} of sites monitored in 2009 exceeded a thousand, whilst trends were assessed for 53 of the 59 regularly occurring UK species. • Following two of the poorest years on record for butterflies in the UK, most species made some recovery in {{what turned out to be}} a mixed year, still ranking below average (23) in the 34 - year series. • The year ranked as the second best on record for Painted Lady migration with a huge influx in May/June. • Many expanding species continued to do well, whilst five species produced their highest index of the series – Comma, Green-veined White, Ringlet, Speckled Wood and the habitat specialist, <b>Large</b> <b>Heath.</b> • However, despite a warm, sunny start to the year, much of the butterfly season in July and August was once again characterised by wet weather having an adverse effect on a number of species. • Four species had their worst year with continued declines for some of our most threatened species – Duke of Burgundy, Heath Fritillary, Lulworth Skipper and Wood White. • Other threatened species, as well as some of our commoner species, still produced low indices despite the slight recovery from 2008. • For 47 of the 53 species assessed (89...|$|E
