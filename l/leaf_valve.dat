40|$|Impact {{fatigue life}} of valve leaves has great {{influence}} on energy saving performance and lifetime of small hermetic reciprocating compressors. This paper presented a test system that intended to analysis and evaluate of impact fatigue life of valve leaves used in small hermetic reciprocating compressors. Firstly, an incentive system {{was designed to}} simulate real work condition for <b>valve</b> <b>leaf.</b> Then, a data acquisition system was built to collect the sound signal while <b>valve</b> <b>leaf</b> was being under test. Simultaneously, the system could control the working state of incentive system so that test could be terminated automatically once fatigue was detected. Finally, fatigue detection system was designed to detect fatigue of <b>valve</b> <b>leaf.</b> Fatigue detection was the key point of this test system. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) were applied to analyze sound signal, {{both of which were}} effective in detecting the damage through analyzing. Facts showed that the test system provided a feasible approach to evaluate impact fatigue life for <b>valve</b> <b>leaf</b> manufacturing. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an investigation {{on the impact}} fatigue characteristics of valve leaves that are prevalently used in hermetic reciprocating compressors especially for the household type refrigerators. A unique automated impact fatigue test system has been designed and produced, which enables to carry out impact fatigue tests of the compressor valve leaves under the desired impact velocities. The test system serves investigations on the impact fatigue characteristics with the ability of crack detection and as the subsequent step of automatically terminating the test. The crack detection technique incorporates a non-contact actuation, a data acquisition system and a microphone. The investigation relates the impact fatigue lifetime of the valve leaves with the impact velocity, asymmetrical impact, operation temperature, material type (carbon strip steel, stainless strip steel and new stainless strip steel grade) and tumbling operation duration. Microscopic and metallographic observations were performed on the specimens. It was observed that the crack initiated {{at the edge of}} the valve leaves on the contact surface of <b>valve</b> <b>leaf</b> and vale plate and a particle is torn away from the edge before propagation. As the crack propagates, branching along the crack path is caused by the geometrical shape and stress waves on the valve leaves. The investigation and introduced test system guide the design optimization of valve leaves in terms of compressor performance due to energy consumption and lifetime of the <b>valve</b> <b>leaf...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an investigation {{on the impact}} fatigue characteristics of valve leaves that are prevalently used in hermetic reciprocating compressors especially for the household type refrigerators. The investigation relates the impact fatigue lifetime of the valve leaves that {{is the heart of}} the compressor, with the working temperature, material type (carbon steel, stainless steel and improved stainless steel grade) and tumbling duration after the manufacturing process. The investigation provides a better understanding of the impact fatigue characteristics of valve leaves while designing a high performance compressor to decrease the energy consumption.

40|$|Abstract:- At first glance, {{calculating the}} {{efficiency}} of any type of compression system seems to be straight forward Comparing the work required of an ideal compression process with the work required of an actual compression process. But the difficulty lies in defining appropriate system boundaries that include losses associated with the compression process. Generally the losses {{that occur in the}} refrigerant compressor are Electric motor losses, Mechanical power distribution losses, Heat losses, Cycle losses, Volumetric efficiency losses. The EER (Energy Efficiency Ratio) of the refrigeration and Air Conditioning system is improved by improving the cooling capacity (or) by reducing the power input to the compressor and by reducing the losses. In this project the parameters affecting the performance of reciprocating compressor are analyzed and appropriate modifications have been made which resulted in improving the performance (or) EER of the system. The modifications made are Surface finish improvements and usage of low viscosity co mpressor oils to reduce frictional losses between the mating parts. Reducing the displacement volume and suction <b>valve</b> <b>leaf</b> thickness to reduce the volumetric losses. Finally changing the suction head material from metal to plastic so as to reduce the heat losses and thereby improving the thermal efficienc...|$|R
