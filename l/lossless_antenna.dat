40|$|Correlation {{coefficient}} of received signals across {{a pair of}} antennas is a key performance indicator for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. For multipath environments with uniform 3 D angular power spectrum, the signal correlation between two antennas can be exactly calculated from their 3 D radiation patterns. When radiation patterns are unavailable, a simplified approach that only requires the antennas’ scattering parameters can be used instead. However, the simpler method assumes <b>lossless</b> <b>antennas</b> and thus only works well for antennas with high radiation efficiencies. To {{take into account the}} antenna loss, the idea of equivalent circuit approximation is used in this paper to analytically separate the lossy components (resistance or conductance) from the lossy antenna arrays, using known scattering parameters and radiation efficiencies.

40|$|Abstract—To {{address the}} need for {{fundamental}} universally valid definitions of exact bandwidth and quality factor () of tuned antennas, as well as {{the need for}} efficient accurate approximate formulas for computing this bandwidth and, exact and approximate expressions are found for the bandwidth and of a general single-feed (one-port) lossy or lossless linear antenna tuned to resonance or antiresonance. The approximate expression derived for the exact bandwidth of a tuned antenna differs from previous approximate expressions in that it is inversely proportional to the magnitude 0 (0) of the frequency derivative of the input impedance and, for not too large a bandwidth, it is nearly equal to the exact bandwidth of the tuned antenna at every frequency 0, that is, throughout antiresonant as well as resonant frequency bands. It is also shown that an appropriately defined exact of a tuned lossy or <b>lossless</b> <b>antenna</b> is approximately proportional to 0 (0) and thus this is approximately inversely proportional to the bandwidth (for not too large a bandwidth) of a simply tuned antenna at all frequencies. The exact of a tuned antenna is defined in terms of average internal energies that emerge naturally from Maxwell’s equations applied to the tuned antenna. These internal energies, which are similar but not identical to previously defined quality-factor energies, and the associated are proven to increase without bound as the size of an antenna is decreased. Numerical solutions to thin straight-wire and wire-loop lossy and lossless antennas, as well as to a Yagi antenna and a straight-wire antenna embedded in a lossy dispersive dielectric, confirm the accuracy of the approximate expressions and the inverse relationship between the defined bandwidth and the defined over frequency ranges that cover several resonant and antiresonant frequency bands.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} functions of a radar antenna is to provide spatial filtering that maximizes the radar's sensitivity in the desired sUIveillance direction while suppressing interference signals that enter the radar from other directions. This article describes a UHFradar antennasystemwith exceptional interference-rejectioncapabilities that are achieved through a combination of precision passive beamforming in the azimuth plane, and active, digital adaptive nulling in elevation. The antenna is composed of 14 stacked rows; each row contains a stripline, low-sidelobe, passive corporate-feed network. For signal reception, a separate receiver and analog-to-digital converter are used at each row output. The system adaptively combines the digitized rowsignals to form an elevationpatternwithnulls at the elevation angles ofinterference sources. The antenna systemis part ofan advanced air surveillance radar that Lincoln Laboratory is developing for the Navy. This article describes the design of the antenna system and presents performance analyses and measured results. Modern radars use a variety of electronic counter-countermeasures to suppress both inadvertent interference and intentional jamming. When the desired target and the interferencesource are notatthesamelocation, a radar {{can take advantage of the}} separation to suppress the interference without suppressing the target return. This selective suppression canbe achieved by a radar antenna with a radiation pattern that provides maximum gain in the direction ofthe targetand a verylowresponse in the interference direction. There are several techniques for controlling the shape of an antenna radiation pattern. Passive, fIxed tapering ofthe aperture illumination can produce a pattern with uniformly low sidelobes outside the direction of the main beam. A pattern of this type is useful for suppressing both interference and clutter. A key parameter in low-sidelobe design is the radiation-pattern sidelobe level expressed in relation to isotropic gain, which is the gain of a <b>lossless</b> <b>antenna</b> that radiates uniformly in all directions.

40|$|The sky-averaged, or global, {{background}} of redshifted 21 cm radiation {{is expected to}} be a rich source of information on cosmological reheating and reionization. However, measuring the signal is technically challenging: one must extract a small, frequency-dependent signal from under much brighter spectrally smooth foregrounds. Traditional approaches to study the global signal have used single antennas, which require one to calibrate out the frequency-dependent structure in the overall system gain (due to internal reflections, for example) as well as remove the noise bias from auto-correlating a single amplifier output. This has motivated proposals to measure the signal using cross-correlations in interferometric setups, where additional calibration techniques are available. In this paper we focus on the general principles driving the sensitivity of the interferometric setups to the global signal. We prove that this sensitivity is directly related to two characteristics of the setup: the cross-talk between readout channels (i. e., the signal picked up at one antenna when the other one is driven) and the correlated noise due to thermal fluctuations of lossy elements (e. g., absorbers or the ground) radiating into both channels. Thus in an interferometric setup, one cannot suppress cross-talk and correlated thermal noise without reducing sensitivity to the global signal by the same factor—instead, the challenge is to characterize these effects and their frequency dependence. We illustrate our general theorem by explicit calculations within toy setups consisting of two short-dipole antennas in free space and above a perfectly reflecting ground surface, as well as two well-separated identical <b>lossless</b> <b>antennas</b> arranged to achieve zero cross-talk...|$|R

Theoretically, when stacking idealised <b>lossless</b> dipole <b>antennas</b> in such a fashion, doubling their number will produce double the gain, with an increase of 3.01 dB.

40|$|In practice, the {{radiation}} efficiency of antennas is often {{measured by the}} anechoic chambers. For this method, it takes plenty time and cost. In order {{to bring down the}} measurement costs, another alternative method was proposed and published by H. A. Wheeler in 1959. The Wheeler Cap method can measure {{the radiation}} efficiency of the antenna quickly and easily during the design and development stage. It has the many benefits, such as simple construction, easy and fast to implement, lower cost and accurate enough compared to other methods. Moreover, it is a reliable and extensively used method for measuring the antenna’s radiation efficiency. The basic concept about Wheeler’s method is to use the "radiansphere" which is the boundary between the near field and the far field of any small antenna to measure the radiation efficiency of antenna under test. The radiation efficiency is obtained by performing measurement in two steps i. e. measuring the antenna under test (AUT) without and with conducting radiation metal shield. The main objective of this thesis work is to design and construct a Wheeler cap test set-up. This thesis is performed to study a modified Wheeler cap method which is based on constant power loss principle and according to this principle the loss resistance of AUT remains constant whether the Wheeler cap is placed or removed, it means the AUT has zero or finite radiation resistance. Thus, the radiation efficiency can be measured using the return loss magnitude with or without Wheeler cap. The equivalent RLC circuits of AUT in the free space and with a Wheeler cap have been theoretically reviewed and analyzed. At the same time, the mathematical expressions of radiation efficiency were presented in terms of return loss using equivalent RLC circuits.
