40|$|The {{nanoscale}} {{peeling of}} the graphene sheet on the graphite surface is numerically studied by molecular mechanics simulation. For center-lifting case, the successive partial peelings of the graphene around the <b>lifting</b> <b>center</b> appear as discrete jumps in the force curve, which induce the arched deformation of the graphene sheet. For edge-lifting case, marked atomic-scale friction of the graphene sheet during the nanoscale peeling process is found. During the surface contact, the graphene sheet takes the atomic-scale sliding motion. The {{period of the}} peeling force curve during the surface contact decreases to the lattice period of the graphite.

40|$|Low-aspect-ratio wings having pointed plan {{forms are}} treated on the {{assumption}} that the flow potentials in planes at right angles to the long axis of the airfoils are similar to the corresponding two-dimensional potentials. For the limiting case of small angles of attack and low aspect ratios the theory brings out the following significant properties: (1) The lift of a slender, pointed airfoil moving in the direction of its long axis depends on the increase in width of the sections in a downstream direction. Sections behind the section of maximum width develop no lift. (2) The spanwise loading of such an airfoil is independent of the plan form and approaches the distribution giving a minimum induced drag. (3) The lift distribution of a pointed airfoil travelling point-foremost is relatively unaffected by the compressibility of the air below or above the speed of sound.

The skin friction drag is also estimated in the analysis. The perturbation velocities induced by the wing and pylon, fuselage and fanpod, and nacelle are represented by source and vortex lattices, quadrilateral vortices, and source frustums, respectively. The strengths of these singularities are solved for simultaneously including all interference effects. The wing and pylon planforms, twists, cambers, and thickness distributions, and the fuselage and fanpod geometries can be arbitrary in shape, provided the surface gradients are smooth.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation has}} been conducted in Langley tank no. 2 to determine the hydrodynamic characteristics of two low-drag supercavitating hydrofoils operating {{in a range of}} cavitation numbers from 0 to approximately 6. The hydrofoils had aspect ratios of 1 and 3, and the sections were derived by assuming five terms in the vorticity-distribution expansion of the equivalent airfoil. The aspect-ratio- 1 hydrofoil was also tested at zero cavitation number with two sets of end plates having depths of 3 / 8 and 1 / 4 chords. Zero cavitation number was established by operating the hydrofoils near the water surface so that complete ventilation of the upper surfaces could be obtained. For those depths of submersion where complete ventilation was not obtained through vortex ventilation, two probes were used to introduce air to the upper surfaces of the hydrofoils and to induce complete ventilation. Data were obtained for a range of speeds from 20 to 80 fps, angles of attack from 2 to 20 deg, and ratios of depth of submersion to chord from 0 to 0. 85. The experimental results obtained from the aspect-ratio- 1 and aspect-ratio- 3, five-term hydrofoils were compared with a three-dimensional zero-cavitation-number theory. The theoretical and experimental values of <b>lift</b> and <b>center</b> of pressure for the aspect-ratio- 1 hydrofoil were in agreement, within engineering accuracy, for the range of lift coefficients investigated. The theoretical drag coefficients were lower, by a constant amount, than the experimental drag coefficients.
