5000|$|<b>Lone</b> <b>Signal</b> was a crowdfunded active SETI project {{designed}} to send messages from Earth to an extraterrestrial civilization. Founded by businessman Pierre Fabre {{and supported by}} several entrepreneurs, <b>Lone</b> <b>Signal</b> was based at the Jamesburg Earth Station in Carmel, California. The project's beacon, which commenced continuous operations on June 17, 2013, transmitted short, 144-character messages by citizens of Earth to the red dwarf star Gliese 526, located 17.6 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Boötes. The <b>Lone</b> <b>Signal</b> team hoped to earn [...] million to construct a network of dishes across the Earth's surface, beaming messages to many regions of the Milky Way galaxy. The project ceased transmission shortly after it began {{due to lack of}} funding.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{becoming}} an executive of <b>Lone</b> <b>Signal,</b> Haqq-Misra stated {{his belief that}} extraterrestrial civilizations probably already know of humanity's existence, and reaffirmed his position that the cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact is unknowable. He based this belief {{on the fact that}} various other radio sources have been broadcasting into space for decades, and would be detectable to any civilization with sufficiently large radio telescopes. For example, the hailing message sent by <b>Lone</b> <b>Signal</b> would be detectable with an array area of 50 m2, and the message portion would be detectable by a telescope with 10 km2 of collecting area; by contrast, humanity's most powerful signals, from military radars and the Arecibo Observatory, could be detected with a small, 1 m2 antenna. At the same time, though, the previous messages from the most powerful beaming sources were intermittent, while <b>Lone</b> <b>Signal</b> aimed to establish the first continuous beam to space.|$|R
50|$|To this end, in 2010, Michael W. Busch {{created a}} {{general-purpose}} binary language, later {{used in the}} <b>Lone</b> <b>Signal</b> project to transmit crowdsourced messages to extraterrestrial intelligence. Busch developed the coding scheme and provided Rachel M. Reddick with a test message, in a blind test of decryption. Reddick decoded the entire message after approximately twelve hours of work. This was followed by an attempt to extend the syntax used in the <b>Lone</b> <b>Signal</b> hailing message to communicate in a way that, while neither mathematical nor strictly logical, was nonetheless understandable given the prior definition of terms and concepts in the hailing message.|$|R
5000|$|The hailing {{component}} {{is not an}} end in itself, but {{is designed to be}} a [...] "Rosetta Stone" [...] toward understanding the more complex message component, consisting of brief, 144-character statements by the general public. These messages, with widely varying languages and contents, were posted from the <b>Lone</b> <b>Signal</b> website. Individuals who have signed up to send messages with <b>Lone</b> <b>Signal,</b> collectively known as the [...] "beaming community", were permitted to send one message for free, and thereafter required to purchase [...] "message credits" [...] in order to fund the operation of the project. The content of messages sent via <b>Lone</b> <b>Signal</b> could be syndicated to the Twitter and Facebook accounts of beaming community members as desired. It was in this beaming community user space that an attempt was being made to extend the syntax used in the hailing message to communicate in a way that, while neither mathematical nor strictly logical, was nonetheless designed to be understandable given the prior definition of terms and concepts in the hailing message.|$|R

50|$|MTP2 {{provides}} flow control, {{error detection}} and sequence checking, and retransmits unacknowledged messages. MTP2 uses packets called <b>signal</b> <b>units</b> to transmit SS7 messages.

50|$|The Jamesburg Earth Station, {{one of the}} world's largest {{tracking}} satellite dish antennas, is located in Carmel Valley.

50|$|Various {{commentators}} have identified several dangers with messaging extraterrestrial intelligence, which chief scientific officer Jacob Haqq-Misra {{covered in a}} 2013 paper before joining <b>Lone</b> <b>Signal.</b> In his paper, Haqq-Misra stated that while ordinary communication which might involve inadvertent leakage into space would not pose a threat, the dangers of actively beaming messages to extraterrestrial intelligences, and hence a determination {{of whether or not}} such beaming activities should be carried out, are uncertain.|$|R

30|$|As {{seen from}} the Figure  3, the virtual dc link voltage and rotor voltage signals are fed to the {{controlling}} <b>unit.</b> The <b>signal</b> from controlling <b>unit</b> and Vc value is used to generate the reference voltage signal to be fed to the modulation control <b>signal</b> <b>unit.</b> Similarly, the second PI controller is used to generate the reference current signal to be fed to the modulation control <b>signal</b> <b>unit.</b> The modulation control <b>signal</b> <b>unit</b> generates the <b>signal</b> to be fed to the space vector modulation unit {{on the basis of}} received reference voltage and reference current signals. The space vector modulation <b>unit</b> processes the <b>signal</b> received from the modulation control <b>signal</b> <b>unit</b> and the <b>signal</b> from the rotor voltage calculator. The signals generated from space vector modulation unit control the switching and operation of the matrix converter which is a major contribution by this paper. Since the large disturbances and noise is expected due to variable wind profile, hence, the forced oscillations and steady-state errors are eliminated in this process.|$|R
40|$|An {{indirect}} {{fluorescent antibody}} test was adapted for measuring serum anti-Treponema hyodysenteriae antibodies with a fluorometer. The immunofluorescence was recorded as fluorescent <b>signal</b> <b>units.</b> Cultures of T. hyodysenteriae and Treponema innocens were used as antigen. There was a significant (P less than 0. 01) correlation between the immunofluorescence recorded with the fluorometer and that evaluated visually with a microscope. The swine exposed orally to swine dysentery infective inoculum and subsequently hyperimmunized by the intravenous inoculation of live cultures of T. hyodysenteriae had the highest average fluorescent <b>signal</b> <b>unit,</b> which was 104. 5. There was a significant (P less than 0. 01) correlation between the level of anti-T. hyodysenteriae antibody and the interval length between {{the last day of}} diarrhea and the day of bleeding. However, in measuring fluorescent <b>signal</b> <b>units</b> in serum from swine infected with nonpathogenic large spirochetes, (T. innocens), there was also a significant (P less than 0. 01) correlation between T. hyodysenteriae and T. innocens as antigen. The coefficient of variation of the average fluorescent <b>signal</b> <b>unit</b> for a highly positive serum and a highly negative serum between 16 runs of assays were 5. 7 % and 19 % respectively; the coefficient of variation of the average fluorescent <b>signal</b> <b>unit</b> for duplicate samples on 358 serum samples tested was 5. 8 %...|$|R

Aleksandr Zaitsev, an expert in interstellar radio communication and Chief Scientist of the Radio Engineering and Electronics Institute of the Russian Academy of Science, pointed out the futility of choosing Polaris as a target considering it is a super giant star with relatively poor potential to host alien life.|$|R
