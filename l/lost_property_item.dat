5000|$|Many {{exceptions}} may {{be applied}} at common law {{to the rule}} that the first finder of <b>lost</b> <b>property</b> has a superior claim of right over any other person except the previous owner. For example, a trespasser's claim to <b>lost</b> <b>property</b> which he finds while trespassing is generally inferior to the claim of the respective landowner. As a corollary to this exception, a landowner has superior claim over a find made within the non-public areas of his property, so if a customer finds <b>lost</b> <b>property</b> in the public area of a store, the customer has superior claim to the <b>lost</b> <b>property</b> over that of the store-owner, but if the customer finds the <b>lost</b> <b>property</b> in the non-public area of that store, such as an area marked [...] "Employees Only," [...] the store-owner will have superior claim, as the customer was trespassing when he found it.|$|R

50|$|For example, if the <b>lost</b> <b>property</b> {{is found}} by a tenant {{inside the walls}} of his leasehold, or by an {{employee}} embedded within the soil of an estate owned by his employer, the landowner (as employer or landlord) of the property where it was found usually has a superior claim of right over that of the finder. However, this is not always the case, as a long-term tenant who finds <b>lost</b> <b>property</b> within the leased area of his leasehold may have a superior claim over that of his landlord (especially if the landlord has never been to the property). While employers usually have a superior claim over <b>lost</b> <b>property</b> found by their employees, exceptions to this exist as well, as modern law sometimes grants the employee superior claim if turning over <b>lost</b> <b>property</b> to his employer is not part of his job description (such as if the employee is an interior decorator).|$|R

This paper discusses {{the question of whether}} virtual <b>property,</b> such as <b>items</b> available in virtual world environments like Linden Lab’s Second Life and Blizzard’s World of Warcraft, {{should be considered}} a valid digital good. The makeup of a virtual <b>property</b> <b>items</b> are explored in this paper and their key features compared and contrasted with that of digital goods. Common examples of digital goods include: electronic books, software, digital music and digital movies. These goods are considered a tangible commodity, that is they have an unlimited supply and secondly they are in a digital/binary form (a sequence of 1 ’s and 0 s’). When looking at why a virtual <b>property</b> <b>items</b> {{should be included in the}} category of ‘digital goods’, it is important to consider how items in a virtual world come to exist and how the availability of these items are often controlled by publishers and developers. The aim of this paper is show that digital goods should not be limited to the traditional views such as electronic books, software, music and movies; but in fact the term ‘digital good’ should also include the active market of virtual <b>property</b> <b>items...</b>|$|R
