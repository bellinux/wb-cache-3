With just a simple nut, some backlash is inevitable. On manual (non-CNC) machine tools, the way that machinists compensate for the effect of backlash is to approach all precise positions using the same direction of travel.

40|$|In {{the present}} work the {{dynamical}} {{behavior of a}} magnetic levitating <b>linear</b> <b>bearing</b> suitable for working in the non-hysteretic range of forces is presented. The presented bearing device is composed of a high temperature superconductor with semi-cylindrical shape and a levitating slider made of a permanent magnet. Meissner repulsion forces of the superconductor provides stable equilibrium and restoring forces in 4 degrees of freedom (DOF), allowing the magnet to displace linearly along the axis of the superconducting semi-cylinder. A custom-made model based on numerical integration of coupled electromechanical equations has been developed, demonstrating good accuracy between the solution obtained and commercial FEM software ones. Radial and axial stiffness of the bearing have been calculated using this model. The vertical equilibrium as a stable position of the <b>linear</b> <b>bearing</b> displacement was found. Dynamical and transient simulation was done {{in order to determine}} the position of the levitating magnet for different external perturbations. Moreover, the calculation of the maximum pressures and thus the magnetic field applied for each position of the displacement proves that it can operate at 100 K or below. It can be assured that a complete Meissner state occurs; hence the displacement will be completely non-hysteretic. Such a non-hysteretic passive <b>linear</b> <b>bearing</b> can be very suitable for long-stroke precision positioning. The high translational symmetry of the magnetic field seen by the permanent magnet assures a usable long stroke of around ± 90 mm with full performance and ± 150 mm with reduced performance.

40|$|Abstract. Copper {{beryllium}} (CuBe) is {{materials that}} are widely used for mechanical applications. In this paper, the use of copper beryllium for cantilever spring of a vibration sensor will be informed. Cantilever spring plays important role in a vibration sensor, because it transfers vibration energy of the measured system into the sensor. Therefore, {{it is important to}} know the dynamic characteristics of the cantilever spring. An optical method, called Levitation Mass Method (LMM), is proposed to measure the dynamic characteristic of the cantilever. In the method, the force of cantilever spring is measured as the inertial force worked on a mass. A pneumatic <b>linear</b> <b>bearing</b> is used to realize a linear motion with sufficiently small friction acting on the mass, i. e., the moving part of the <b>linear</b> <b>bearing.</b> The inertial force acting on the mass is calculated from the velocity of the mass, and the velocity is determined highly accurately by means of measuring the Doppler shift frequency of the laser light beam reflecting on the mass using an optical interferometer.

40|$|Abstract – A {{new type}} of high {{precision}} electromagnetic suspension (EMS) which can support heavy tray along long stroke rail is proposed in this paper. Compared with the conventional EMS, the suggested moving-core typed EMS has the levitation electromagnets (EMs) on the fixed rail. This scheme has high load capability caused by iron-core and enables simple tray structure. Also {{it does not have}} precision degradation caused by heat generation from EMs, which is a drawback of conventional EMS. With these merits, the proposed EMS can be an optimal contactless <b>linear</b> <b>bearing</b> in next generation flat panel display (FPD) manufacturing process if the ability of long stroke movement is proved. So a special Section Switching Algorithm (SSA) is derived from the resultant force and moment equations of the levitated tray which enables long stroke movement of the tray. In order to verify the feasibility of the suggested SSA, a simple test-setup of the EMS with 2 Section-changes is made up and servo-controlled in the simulation and experiment. The simulation shows the perfect changeover the EMs, and the experiment shows overall control performance of under ± 40 μm gap deviations. These results reveal that the newly suggested contactless <b>linear</b> <b>bearing</b> can simultaneously achieve high load capability and precision gap control as well as long stroke...|$|E
