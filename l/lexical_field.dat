50|$|<b>Lexical</b> <b>field</b> theory, or word-field theory, was {{introduced}} on March 12, 1931 by the German linguist Jost Trier. Trier argued that words acquired their meaning through their relationships to other words {{within the same}} word-field. An extension {{of the sense of}} one word narrows the meaning of neighboring words, with the words in a field fitting neatly together like a mosaic. If a single word undergoes a semantic change, then the whole structure of the <b>lexical</b> <b>field</b> changes. The <b>lexical</b> <b>field</b> is often used in English to describe terms further with use of different words. Trier's theory assumes that lexical fields are easily definable closed sets, with no overlapping meanings or gaps. These assumptions have been questioned and the theory has been modified since its original formulation.|$|E

The informants were non-native speakers with different proficiency levels, learning Italian both in Italy and outside of it. The main results show how lexical competence develops above all quantitavely at the beginning and intermediate levels, as well a show it develops qualitatevely st more advanced levels in particolar. Different learning inputs greatly affects the development of lexical competence: learners acquiring Italian in Italy have a deeper knowledge of the Italian vocabulary compared to learners learning Italian outside of Italy.

50|$|The {{origin of}} the field theory of {{semantics}} is the <b>lexical</b> <b>field</b> theory introduced by Jost Trier in the 1930s, although according to John Lyons it has historical roots in the ideas of Wilhelm von Humboldt and Johann Gottfried Herder. In the 1960s Stephen Ullmann saw semantic fields as crystallising and perpetuating the values of society. For John Lyons in the 1970s words related in any sense belonged to the same semantic field, and the semantic field was simply a lexical category, which he described as a <b>lexical</b> <b>field.</b> Lyons emphasised the distinction between semantic fields and semantic networks. In the 1980s Eva Kittay developed a semantic field theory of metaphor. This approach {{is based on the}} idea that the items in a semantic field have specific relations to other items in the same field, and that a metaphor works by re-ordering the relations of a field by mapping them on to the existing relations of another field. Sue Atkins and Charles J. Fillmore in the 1990s proposed frame semantics as an alternative to semantic field theory.|$|E

50|$|Reacting {{to older}} linguists' {{emphasis}} on form (especially phonology and morphology), Weisgerber initiated {{what he called}} inhaltbezogene Grammatik ('content-related grammar').

This was initially influenced by the structuralist theories of Ferdinand de Saussure, but Weisgerber's theory soon took him far beyond the simple Saussurean linkage of (linguistic) form and (semantic) content. His other debts were to Wilhelm von Humboldt (notably the insight that language diversity implies a diversity of world-views) and Jost Trier (concurrently with whom he developed the structuralist idea of a word-field or <b>lexical</b> <b>field).</b>|$|E
40|$|Kommunikationsverben, {{an online}} {{reference}} work on German communication verbs {{and part of}} the dictionary portal OWID, describes the meaning of communication verbs on two levels: a lexical level, represented in the dictionary entries and by sets of lexical features, and a conceptual level, represented by different types of situations referred to by specific types of verbs. These two levels have each been implemented in special types of access structures. A first explorative access to the conceptual level provides the user with a list of the main classes of communication verbs, the subclasses of each of these, and the <b>lexical</b> <b>fields</b> pertaining to each subclass. <b>Lexical</b> <b>fields</b> are presented together with a characterisation of the situation type to which the verbs of that field are used to refer.

40|$|Reduced verbal fluency (VF) {{has been}} {{reported}} in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), especially those treated by Deep Brain Stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN DBS). To delineate the nature of this dysfunction we aimed at identifying the particular VF-related operations modified by STN DBS. Eleven PD patients performed VF tasks in their STN DBS ON and OFF condition. To differentiate VF-components modulated by the stimulation, a temporal cluster analysis was performed, separating production spurts (i. e., 'clusters' as correlates of automatic activation spread within <b>lexical</b> <b>fields)</b> from slower cluster transitions (i. e., 'switches' reflecting set-shifting towards new <b>lexical</b> <b>fields).</b> The results were compared to those of eleven healthy control subjects. PD patients produced significantly more switches accompanied by shorter switch times in the STN DBS ON compared to the STN DBS OFF condition. The number of clusters and time intervals between words within clusters were not affected by the treatment state. Although switch behavior in patients with DBS ON improved, their task performance was still lower compared to that of healthy controls. Beyond impacting on motor symptoms, STN DBS seems to influence the dynamics of cognitive procedures. Specifically, the results are in line with basal ganglia roles for cognitive switching, in the particular case of VF, from prevailing lexical concepts to new ones...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a system for}} analysis and visualization of document collections based on <b>lexical</b> <b>fields.</b> A set of documents in any format is first converted to plain text, extracting metadata such as author and title. Stemming algorithms are applied to the resulting word set to map all words on their corresponding principal forms. The documents are then converted into a vector space model, consisting of a vector with weighted terms for each document. To achieve a reduction of dimensionality, and likewise the extraction of <b>lexical</b> <b>fields,</b> latent semantic indexing (LSI) is used, in consideration of several methods for singular value decomposition. Further methods to achieve a dimensionality reduction are presented. Several similarity measures for pairs of documents within the reduced vector space model are presented and analyzed. Visualization occurs in 2 d and 3 d, making use of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) to map documents onto a grid. The three dimensional view is carried out using volume rendering. Another visualization method is a twodimensional plot of principal components. Furthermore, documents can be clustered according to their pairwise similarity; documents within the visualizations can be colored {{on the basis of}} these clusters to gain an oversight over the set documents, their classes and their relations. The software resulting from this work shall have further applications in a general Visual Analytics framework...|$|R

But onomasiology has recently seen new light with the works of Dirk Geeraerts, Andreas Blank, Peter Koch and the periodical Onomasiology Online, which is published at the Katholische Universität Eichstätt-Ingolstadt by Joachim Grzega, Alfred Bammesberger and Marion Schöner.

50|$|Carr {{proposes that}} {{intentional}} vagueness explains the comparatively small <b>lexical</b> <b>field</b> of Japanese insults. One likely {{reason for the}} relatively few Japanese words for 'fool' is vagueness. In both English and Japanese, the words for 'fool' have meanings that vary along scales of friendly-hostile, or joking-serious. In English, {{at one end of}} a scale are words like silly goose and at the other end are words like stupid asshole. And in Japanese, at one end are words like kamaboko baka 蒲鉾馬鹿 'silly chump' and at the other end are words like baka-yarō 馬鹿野郎 'damn fool'. The difference is in the degree of lexical diversification along the scales of meaning. English seems to have more 'fool' words with more specificity - Japanese seems to have fewer 'fool' words with more vagueness. There are decided pragmatic and communicative advantages to such lexical vagueness. If you call me a stupid son-of-a-bitch, I know exactly what you mean. But if you call me a baka-yarō, I cannot be so sure of what you mean. The expression baka-yarō 馬鹿野郎 {{is one of the most}} insulting terms in the Japanese lexicon, but it is vague and can range in meaning from an affectionate 'silly-willy' to an abusive 'jerk-off fool'. Baka-yarō is so widely used that it has become semantically weak and vague. Such vagueness can serve to conceal hostility and thus to maintain social harmony.|$|E
