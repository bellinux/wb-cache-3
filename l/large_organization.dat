Initially it focused on organizing the Polish tourist movement and building mountain huts in the Beskids but later widened its activities to skiing, football, athletics and volleyball. In the 1930s it associated 27 local branches. After World War II it operated half-legally and as Siła, was liquidated by Czechoslovak communist authorities after the Victorious February 1948. It resumed its activity again in 1991, {{after the fall}} of communism.|$|E

40|$|A continual debate {{surrounds}} {{the effectiveness of}} agile software development practices. Some organizations adopt agile practices to become more competitive, improve processes, and reduce costs. Other organizations are skeptical about whether agile development is beneficial. <b>Large</b> <b>organizations</b> face an additional challenge in integrating agile practices with existing standards and business processes. To {{examine the effects of}} agile development practices in <b>large</b> <b>organizations,</b> we review and integrate scientific literature and theory on agile software development. We further organize our theory and observations into a framework with guidelines for <b>large</b> <b>organizations</b> considering agile methodologies. Based on this framework, we present recommendations that suggest ways <b>large</b> <b>organizations</b> with established processes can successfully implement agile practices. Our analysis of the literature and theory provides new insight for researchers of agile software development and assists practitioners in determining how to adopt agile development in their organizations.

25|$|Watchdogs {{have accused}} Kaiser of abusing the power {{imbalance}} {{inherent in the}} arbitration system. Kaiser engages in many cases whereas a customer will usually engage in just one and Kaiser can reject any arbitrator unilaterally, thus they can select company-friendly arbitrators over those that rule in favor of customers. As a <b>large</b> <b>organization,</b> Kaiser can also afford to spend much more on lawyers and orators than the customer, giving them more advantages. In response to criticisms, Kaiser established an Office of Independent Administrators (OIA) in 1999 to oversee the arbitration process. The degree to which this office is actually independent has been questioned.|$|E
25|$|After the American Civil War the Democratic Party under Boss William Tweed's Tammany Hall {{gained a}} {{monopoly}} in both New York City Hall and the New York Legislature. Allegations of corruption rapidly grew as rumors spread that Boss Tweed and associates of Tammany Hall were laundering {{tax payers money}} in real estate and bribing New York State legislatures for favorable legislation. New York City workers under the Tammany Hall system were paid excessive rates on the burden of tax payers. By 1871, New York City residents and the press demanded that the corruption be investigated and cleaned up. On September 4, at Cooper Union, a <b>large</b> <b>organization</b> of reputed citizens was formed known as the Committee of Seventy, that investigated the corruption of Boss Tweed's Tammany Hall Ring. Pierrepont was appointed to and actively served on the legislation commission of the Committee of Seventy. The Committee of Seventy promised to thoroughly investigate Tammany Hall corruption and strongly encouraged honest voters to stop taking bribes from Tammany Hall at the polls during election. By the end of October 1871 the Committee of Seventy had successfully stopped funding Boss Tweed's Tammany Hall by court injunction effectively shutting down the corrupt institution. Tweed was arrested and thrown into jail.|$|E

500|$|The All-China Women's Federation is {{the largest}} women’s {{organization}} in China and the only women’s organization still in existence that appeared before the 1980s. However, the ACWF has recently been struggling to adequately represent a diverse range of women’s interest, and some critics believe that women’s growing needs ought to be represented by a more diverse group of organizations. Most women-interest NGOs operating in China are currently listed under the ACWF and have sought {{a close relationship with}} the organization to gain legitimacy and protection. [...] Some of the organizations that are listed outside the ACWF are run by women who are affiliated with the ACWF, so there is considerable overlap. New women's groups have more freedom in exploring sensitive topics and alternative theories on gender because they are not affiliated with the government in any manner. [...] The ACWF has encouraged some of these groups to form, and brought others under their umbrella, which extends the reach of the ACWF. However, given the limited resources available to the women’s movement, and the ACWF historically representing the only <b>large</b> <b>organization,</b> tensions exists between these women’s groups and the ACWF.|$|E

That body duly elected Siles as president.|$|E

40|$|Small {{and medium}} size {{enterprises}} (SMEs) are the life blood of modern economies. That they should remain competitive and produce high quality outputs is of importance {{not only at}} the macro level but also to <b>larger</b> <b>organizations,</b> because SMEs are often suppliers of goods and services to <b>larger</b> <b>organizations</b> and lack of product quality would adversely affect the competitive ability of the <b>larger</b> <b>organizations.</b> Total Quality Management (TQM) is considered an important quality improvement tool.

This paper initially examines the differences between the characteristics of SMEs and large organizations; the relationship between the size of organization and inherent characteristics of TQM; and the effect of organization size on the implementation of TQM using deductive research. These issues are further examined through inductive research. For this purpose the development of TQM was studied in four small-medium size organizations. total quality management implementation SME culture organizational change...|$|R
2500|$|Despite {{being in}} a {{potentially}} favorable situation, Hooker halted his brief offensive. His actions may have demonstrated his {{lack of confidence in}} handling the complex actions of such a <b>large</b> <b>organization</b> for the first time (he had been an effective and aggressive division and corps commander in previous battles), but he had also decided before beginning the campaign that he would fight the battle defensively, forcing Lee, with his small army, to attack his own, larger one. At the [...] Battle of Fredericksburg (December 13, 1862), the Union army had done the attacking and met with a bloody defeat. Hooker knew Lee could not sustain such a defeat and keep an effective army in the field, so he ordered his men to withdraw back into the Wilderness and take a defensive position around Chancellorsville, daring Lee to attack him or retreat with superior forces at his back. He confused matters by issuing a second order to his subordinates to hold their positions until 5 p.m., but {{by the time it was}} received, most of the Union units had begun their rearward movements. That evening, Hooker sent a message to his corps commanders, [...] "The major general commanding trusts that a suspension in the attack to-day will embolden the enemy to attack him." ...|$|E
60|$|The present {{economic}} system concentrates initiative {{in the hands}} of a small number of very rich men. Those who are not capitalists have, almost always, very little choice as to their activities when once they have selected a trade or profession; they are not part of the power that moves the mechanism, but only a passive portion of the machinery. Despite political democracy, there is still an extraordinary degree of difference in the power of self-direction belonging to a capitalist and to a man who has to earn his living. Economic affairs touch men's lives, at most times, much more intimately than political questions. At present the man who has no capital usually has to sell himself to some <b>large</b> <b>organization,</b> such as a railway company, for example. He has no voice in its management, and no liberty in politics except what his trade-union can secure for him. If he happens to desire a form of liberty which is not thought important by his trade-union, he is powerless; he must submit or starve.|$|E

The intelligent reader of Mr. Lawson's Frenzied Finance or of the bankruptcy proceedings of Mr. Hooley realizes this idyll is scarcely true to nature. Through the seas and shallows of investment flow great tides and depressions, on which the big fortunes ride to harbour while the little accumulations, capsized and swamped, quiver down to the bottom. It becomes more and more true that the small man saves his money for the rich man's pocket. Only by drastic State intervention is a certain measure of safety secured for insurance, and in America recently we have had the spectacle of the people's insurance-money used as a till by the rich financiers.|$|E
