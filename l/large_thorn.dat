50|$|The plot {{is a more}} or less careful {{rendition}} of George Bernard Shaw's script. Androcles, a fugitive Christian tailor, accompanied by his nagging wife, is on the run from his Roman persecutors. While hiding in the forest he comes upon a wild lion who approaches him with a wounded paw. Androcles sees that the cause is a <b>large</b> <b>thorn</b> embedded in its paw, which he draws out while talking baby language to the lion. His wife had fled, and Androcles is next seen in a procession of Christian prisoners {{on their way to the}} Colosseum in Rome. They are joined by the fierce convert Ferrovius who subsequently provides much of the comic entertainment in his struggle to keep his nature in check. Love interest is also introduced by the growing attraction of the Captain to the noble-born convert Lavinia. Eventually the party is sent into the arena to be slaughtered by gladiators, but Ferrovius kills all of them and accepts a commission offered him in the Praetorian Guards. To appease the crowd, one Christian is needed to be savaged by the lions and Androcles volunteers in order to uphold 'the honour of the tailors'. It turns out that the lion is the one that Androcles has helped, and the two waltz round the arena to the acclaim of the people. The Emperor dashes behind the scenes to get a closer look and has to be rescued from the lion by Androcles. He then orders an end to the persecution of Christians and allows Androcles and his new 'pet' to depart in peace.|$|E

40|$|Woodstock. The federal {{government}} {{and many of the}} surrounding states have dropped their prohibition against growing gooseberries and currants because the real cause has been determined to be the black currant. There is some movement to have these regulations rescinded in New York. Description: Gooseberries are deciduous shrubs, fast growing under optimum conditions to 3 feet tall and 6 feet wide. American types have weeping stems that will root wherever they touch the ground and can be invasive. Annual growth is in a single flush in the spring. The roots are superficial, fine and easily damaged by frequent cultivation. The buds perk up early in the spring, dotting the stems with green when most other plants are still tawny. The leaves are alternate, single, deeply lobed, and glossy dark green (European types), or pale to gray-green and sometimes finely pubescent (American types). The stems are thin, becoming woody, with a <b>large</b> <b>thorn</b> at each axil. American gooseberry stems are densely bristly, with one or more additional The Crop Profile/PMSP database, including this document, is supported by USDA NIFA...|$|E

It is characterized by <b>large</b> <b>thorns</b> with star-shaped bases scattered over the disc, and by the wide, black marginal bands on the underside of the disc.

50|$|Preying {{mainly on}} small bony fishes and crustaceans, the Jenkins' whipray is {{commonly}} found in inshore, sandy or silty habitats shallower than 50 m. It is aplacental viviparous, with the females nourishing their developing young with histotroph ("uterine milk"). This species is regularly caught by coastal fisheries across much of its range, particularly in the Arafura Sea; its skin is highly valued for the <b>large</b> <b>thorns,</b> while the meat and cartilage may also be marketed. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the Jenkins' whipray under Vulnerable, noting that it faces minimal conservation threats off northern Australia, which encompasses {{a large portion of}} its range. However, there is intense fishing pressure in Southeast Asia and has led to significant population declines there.|$|R

Their bodies are covered with minute dermal denticles; also, several rows of denticles are located inside the buccopharyngeal cavity. The shape of these denticles in Platyrhina and the similar Platyrhinoidis distinguish them from all other guitarfish species. <b>Large</b> <b>thorns</b> occur around the eyes and on the shoulders, and are arranged in rows along the back and tail.
