5000|$|The {{shell of}} the M1 was changed mainly in silhouette, {{as seen from the}} side, from its World War II beginnings. The second, and last, U.S. {{production}} run of about one million M1s during the mid 1960s, <b>lowered</b> (<b>streamlined)</b> the top forehead portion. The bulk of the helmet is constructed from a single piece of pressed hadfield manganese steel. The rim edge of the shell has a crimped metal band running around it, which provides a clean edge. This is usually known as the [...] "rim". The metal band of the rim material has a seam where the ends of the strip meet. On the earliest shells the seam met at the front. This was moved {{to the back of the}} rim in 1944, when the rim went from being made of stainless steel to manganese steel.|$|R
50|$|Form drag {{is caused}} by {{movement}} of the aircraft through the air. This type of drag, also known as air resistance or profile drag varies with the square of speed (see drag equation). For this reason profile drag is more pronounced at higher speeds, forming {{the right side of}} the lift/velocity graph's U shape. Profile drag is <b>lowered</b> primarily by <b>streamlining</b> and reducing cross section.|$|R
2500|$|The {{base model}} Profi wing is a cable-braced, king post-equipped hang glider-style wing for two-place trikes, while the Profi TL is a [...] "topless" [...] design, lacking the king post and using <b>streamlined</b> <b>lower</b> lift struts instead of wires. The topless design lowers the overall {{height of the}} wing and allows storage in lower-roofed hangars. A carbon fibre leading edge insert is optional, while {{winglets}} are standard on the TL model.|$|R
40|$|It is the {{position}} of this article {{that the benefits of}} a regime of copyright law can be maintained while shedding {{at least some of the}} wastefulness of monopolistic competition. This article cuts against the grain of modem copyright law by making the case that a more substantive approach to the issues of creativity and authorship would <b>lower</b> costs, <b>streamline</b> the system, and raise the level of socially beneficial creativity. In Section II, I will elaborate on the allocative/distributive distinction and their interconnectedness. In Section III, I will focus on an enhanced creativity standard and argue that an elevated standard is unlikely to cause anything of value to be lost. I turn to the matter of authorship in Section IV...|$|R
40|$|This Article cuts {{against the}} grain of modern {{copyright}} law by making the case that a more substantive approach to the issues of creativity and authorship would <b>lower</b> costs, <b>streamline</b> the system, and raise the level of socially beneficial creativity. Increasing the creativity requirement is designed to curb what might be called artistic product differentiation that has no real impact on economic, cultural, and social development. Infusing an element of substance into authorship by requiring some level of preconception by authors would produce the same result. After all, except in the most unusual instances, when an author does not know until after {{the fact that he has}} created something, it is hard to make a case that an incentive to create played a role. Raising both of these standards would reduce costly, and perhaps chilling, distributive battles and properly focus copyright on the internalization of efforts that are more likely to advance the public interest by raising the level of creative contribution...|$|R
50|$|It was a {{parasol wing}} monoplane, its wings braced to the <b>lower</b> {{fuselage}} with <b>streamlined</b> steel tube V-struts. The {{centre of the}} wing, thinner than the outer parts, {{was close to the}} fuselage and was braced there on short cabane struts. The plan was roughly elliptical, though the leading edge was straight over about half the span and there was a deep, rounded cut-out in the trailing edge to improve the pilot's field of view. There was no dihedral. The wing was all wood, built around a pair of box spars 600 mm apart and plywood covered. Its ailerons occupied almost 60% of the span.|$|R
40|$|Turbulence, {{induced by}} {{transverse}} and inclined air jets, {{in an air}} stream flowing in a four inch square duct at 138 - 250 feet per second, was studied, Flow patterns were constructed from four hundred velocity profiles measured at various distances from the injector wall and at numerous positions upstream and downstream from the injector under different experimental conditions. The pattern indicates a steady widening of the jet, a curving motion, with the lower portion forming a vortex in the wake. The {{upper part of the}} jet widens out, slows down and reaches mainstream velocity farther down the duct. A method for predicting the shape of the upper bounding streamline was developed from two-dimensional potential flow theory and a penetration correlation with exponents deduced from the results in this study. The shape of the <b>lower</b> bounding <b>streamline</b> and the vortex can be predicted by a logarithmic elliptical spiral using constants determined in this investigation. The analogy between the patterns {{in the wake of a}} jet and a solid rod was checked in a six inch round duct and found to be of doubtful validity...|$|R
50|$|It was an all-wood {{aircraft}} with a high, two-part, braced wing. The {{leading edge}} of each half-wing was straight and unswept over the inner half of the span where the chord increased outwards from the root, but the outer section was straight-tapered to squared tips. Each was built around two spars, with the leading edge plywood-covered to form a box girder with the forward spar. Aft, the wing was fabric covered. The outer wing sections carried ailerons, hinged obliquely so their chord increased strongly outwards. The wings were attached {{to the top of}} the fuselage and braced to the <b>lower</b> fuselage with <b>streamlined,</b> inverted V-struts to the spars 2.0 m from the fuselage sides. Folding the wings around a joint at the forward spar root for transport or storage reduced the width to 7 ft and took less than five minutes.|$|R
40|$|With the {{prevalence}} of obesity rapidly increasing worldwide, understanding the processes leading to excessive eating behavior becomes increasingly important. Considering the widely recognized crucial role of reward processes in food intake, we examined the white matter wiring and integrity of the anatomical reward network in obesity. Anatomical wiring of the reward network was reconstructed derived from diffusion weighted imaging in 31 obese participants and 32 normal-weight participants. Network wiring was compared {{in terms of the}} white matter volume as well as in terms of white matter microstructure, revealing <b>lower</b> number of <b>streamlines</b> and <b>lower</b> fiber integrity within the reward network in obese subjects. Specifically, the orbitofrontal cortex and striatum nuclei including accumbens, caudate and putamen showed lower strength and network clustering in the obesity group as compared to healthy controls. Our results provide evidence for obesity-related disruptions of global and local anatomical connectivity of the reward circuitry in regions that are key in the reinforcing mechanisms of eating-behavior processes...|$|R
50|$|By 1938 Ferdinand {{had given}} up trying to arrange for a supply of VW parts for the Type 64. Ferdinand and his son Ferry Porsche decided to {{redesign}} the car from the ground up to be built internally by Porsche. This would have been the first car actually built by Porsche themselves. Known as the Type 114, or F-Wagen, a sort of portmanteau of Ferry and P-Wagen, it was a significant departure from the Type 64. Although it never reached the prototype stage the design drawings were all but completed and included a novel water cooled 72° V10 engine in a true mid engine layout, as opposed to the VW's rear engine layout. Suspension was by trailing arms in front and swing axles in the rear, with drum brakes at all four corners. The body was aluminum and resembled a <b>lower,</b> stretched, and <b>streamlined</b> VW. Porsche had hopes of producing this car, but international tensions and a poor economy lead to its cancellation. Porsche did manage to salvage part of its investment by selling the transaxle design to Volkswagen.|$|R
40|$|With {{the rapid}} rise of Business to Business (B 2 B) {{transactions}} {{over the internet}} and the increasing use of e-procurement solutions by large organizations for purchasing, {{there is a need to}} reengineer current legacy supply chain management systems in order to integrate them with modern e-procurement systems. Although there is a great deal of research in the area of integration with e-procurement systems, there is little attention for security aspect of this integration that responds to the need for accurate and secure information exchange has become essential to doing business. Security is a consistent and growing problem for e-commerce and procurement solutions. As the number and frequency of security violations continues to rise, there is a corresponding dependence on information technology to drive business value, which in turn increases the importance and criticality of transaction data. The result is an increasing demand for secure e-procurement transactions to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data. Secure transactions are essential if organizations are to fully realize the benefits of e-procurement which include increased productivity, <b>lower</b> purchasing pricing, <b>streamlined</b> processes, reduced order fulfillment time and greater budgetary control; all of which can contribute to increasing an organization’s competitive advantage. This research is a case study which evaluates the security of transactions for the integration of an e-procurement solution in a large organization. I...|$|R
