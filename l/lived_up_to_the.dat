5|$|Nebraska {{was ranked}} No. 1 in the Associated Press preseason poll, and <b>lived</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ranking {{in its first}} game of the season. On September 7, Nebraska {{overwhelmed}} the Michigan State Spartans, 5514. After an off week, however, Nebraska fans were shocked by one of the first big national upsets of the season as Nebraska was shut out by No. 17 Arizona State, 190. The loss dropped Nebraska to No. 8 in the rankings, but as the season wore on, Nebraska rose through the ranks as the Cornhuskers won seven consecutive games. Nebraska's 101 record to that point earned it a trip to the first-ever Big 12 Championship Game in St. Louis, Missouri, against the Texas Longhorns.|$|E
5|$|Super Bowl XXV {{took place}} amidst a {{background}} of war and patriotism in front of 73,813 fans at Tampa Stadium, in Tampa, Florida. The Persian Gulf War had begun {{less than two weeks}} previous and the nation rallied around the Super Bowl as a symbol of America. Adding to the patriotism was Whitney Houston's stirring rendition of the National Anthem, which became {{known as one of the}} greatest renditions in Super Bowl history. The game <b>lived</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stirring Anthem, as it went down as the most competitive Super Bowl in history. The Giants got off to a quick 3–0 lead. However, the Bills scored the next 12 points, on a field goal, a touchdown by backup running back Don Smith, and a safety after Jeff Hostetler was sacked in the end zone by Bruce Smith, to give the Bills a 12–3 lead. The Giants then ran a drive that took almost 8 minutes, and culminated in a 14-yard touchdown pass from Hostetler to Stephen Baker making the score 12–10 at halftime.|$|E

Curry has had success in the league, but perhaps has not <b>lived</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lofty expectations that Krause had.

The comeback was the largest in Patriots history, until the Patriots overcame a 25-point deficit in Super Bowl 51.|$|E
