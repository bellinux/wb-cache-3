5|$|Photographing {{an eclipse}} is {{possible}} with fairly common camera equipment. In {{order for the}} disk of the Sun/Moon to be easily visible, a fairly high magnification long focus <b>lens</b> <b>is</b> needed (at least 200mm for a 35mm camera), and for the disk to fill most of the frame, a longer <b>lens</b> <b>is</b> needed (over 500mm). As with viewing the Sun directly, looking at it through the optical viewfinder of a camera can produce damage to the retina, so care is recommended. Solar filters are required for digital photography even if an optical viewfinder is not used. Using a camera's live view feature or an electronic viewfinder is safe for the human eye, but the Sun's rays could potentially irreparably damage digital image sensors unless the <b>lens</b> <b>is</b> covered by a properly designed solar filter.|$|E
5|$|The <b>lens</b> <b>is</b> sold in {{versions}} {{that fit}} the bayonet mounts of Nikon, Canon, Sigma, Sony/Minolta and Pentax APS-C cameras.|$|E
5|$|By {{combining}} the wide angle focal lengths with narrow apertures, the lens provides strong {{depth of field}} rather than making blurred backgrounds. The <b>lens</b> <b>is</b> constructed with a hybrid aspherical lens that when combined with two glass mold elements provides excellent correction for distortion as well as astigmatism.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} <b>lenses</b> <b>are</b> listed below; however all later Nikonos UW-Nikkor <b>lenses</b> <b>are</b> compatible.|$|R
50|$|Faster Leica <b>lenses</b> <b>are</b> offered {{with the}} trade names Nocticron or Noctilux. Elmarit <b>lenses</b> <b>are</b> slower.|$|R
40|$|Compound concave {{refractive}} <b>lenses</b> <b>are</b> {{used for}} focusing neutron beam. Investigations of spectral and focusing properties of a refractive neutron <b>lens</b> <b>are</b> presented. Resolution of the imaging {{system on the}} base of refractive neutron lenses depends on material properties and parameters of neutron source. Model of refractive neutron <b>lens</b> <b>are</b> proposed. Results of calculation diffraction resolution and focal depth of refractive neutron <b>lens</b> <b>are</b> discussed...|$|R
5|$|The <b>lens</b> <b>is</b> {{useful for}} deliberative shots by {{landscape}} photographers and other skilled artists. The {{challenge of the}} vast field of view may be overcome by some casual users. Car photographers benefit from the new perspective of this lens. The lens was a 2010 American Photo Editor's Choice.|$|E
5|$|The lens {{features}} a hypersonic zoom motor for its autofocus, {{which is considered}} to be a fast and quiet design. In addition, manual override is allowed in the single-shot autofocus mode. The lens, which focuses internally, has one of the lowest maximum magnification measurements in its class (which includes the Canon 10–18mm and 10–22mm, Sigma 10–20mm f/3.5 and Sigma 10–20mm f/4–5.6 EX DC HSM, Tamron 10–24mm f/3.5–4.5 DI II, Nikon 10–24mm f/3.5–4.5G ED AF-S DX, and Tokina 11–16mm f/2.8 AT-X Pro DX lenses). The lens' autofocus feature is not functional with Pentax ist* series and K100D DSLR cameras that do not support hypersonic zoom mechanics. The <b>lens</b> <b>is</b> capable of focusing from infinity to minimum focusing distance and back in under a second: so micro focusing is rapid. However, because of the narrow focus range (0.13x) the <b>lens</b> <b>is</b> not suitable for macro photography.|$|E
5|$|The <b>lens</b> <b>is</b> {{equipped}} with a full-frame digital SLR-compatible mount allowing the usage of both APS-C sized cameras and formats larger than APS-C – the build in lens hood however visibly restricts {{the field of view}} (FOV) on formats larger than APS-C – see example above. The FOV in APS-C sized cameras is further restricted at shorter focal lengths if the front cap adaptor ring is not removed – see example below.|$|E
5000|$|The EF-S <b>lens</b> mount <b>is</b> a {{relatively}} new offering from Canon, so the selection of available <b>lenses</b> <b>is</b> limited compared to the full EF range, but it is backward compatible with the EF mount, and can therefore still accept all EF lenses. The variety of EF-S prime <b>lenses</b> <b>is</b> very limited in comparison to EF-S zoom lenses, with three primes to nine zooms. EF-S <b>lenses</b> <b>are</b> very popular due to their lower cost and zoom <b>lenses</b> <b>are</b> more preferable by amateur photographers. , no EF-S <b>lens</b> has <b>been</b> produced with the [...] "L" [...] designation or with diffractive optics, and only three EF-S prime <b>lenses</b> have <b>been</b> produced.|$|R
50|$|The Canon EF 100 mm <b>lenses</b> <b>are</b> {{used for}} Canon DSLR cameras. There are four {{different}} types of EF 100 mm lens for Canon. Certain <b>lenses</b> <b>are</b> best for macro photos, whereas other <b>lenses</b> <b>are</b> good for taking pictures of subjects from a distance.|$|R
50|$|On {{the back}} of Canon <b>lenses</b> <b>is</b> a six-digit code, which {{indicates}} where the <b>lens</b> <b>was</b> manufactured and when.|$|R
5|$|The {{eyes of the}} octopus {{are large}} and {{are at the top}} of the head. They are similar in {{structure}} to those of a fish and are enclosed in a cartilaginous capsule fused to the cranium. The cornea is formed from a translucent epidermal layer and the slit-shaped pupil forms a hole in the iris and lies just behind. The <b>lens</b> <b>is</b> suspended behind the pupil and photoreceptive retinal cells cover the back of the eye. The pupil can be adjusted in size and a retinal pigment screens incident light in bright conditions.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after his}} {{graduation}} in 1968, Kikai worked {{for two years}} as a truck driver and for two in a shipyard. Meanwhile, he stayed {{in touch with his}} philosophy professor from his university days, Sadayoshi Fukuda, whose interests extended to writing a regular column for the magazine Camera Mainichi; he introduced Kikai to its editor, Shōji Yamagishi, who showed him photographs by Diane Arbus that made a great impact on Kikai. Kikai started to take photographs in 1969. At that time (when somebody fresh out of university could expect to earn ¥40,000 per month), a Hasselblad SLR camera normally cost ¥600,000; Kikai heard of an opportunity to buy one for ¥320,000 and mentioned this to Fukuda, who immediately lent him the money, with no interest, and no date or pressure for repayment. (The loan was eventually repaid.) This Hasselblad 500CM, with its 80mm <b>lens,</b> <b>is</b> what Kikai has used for his portraits ever since.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of {{pinnipeds}} {{are relatively}} large for {{their size and}} are positioned {{near the front of}} the head. One exception is the walrus, whose smaller eyes are located on the sides of its head. This is because it feeds on immobile bottom dwelling mollusks and hence does not need acute vision. A seal's eye is adapted for seeing both underwater and in air. The <b>lens</b> <b>is</b> mostly spherical, and much of the retina is equidistant from the lens center. The cornea has a flattened center where refraction is nearly equal in both water and air. Pinnipeds also have very muscular and vascularized irises. The well-developed dilator muscle gives the animals a great range in pupil dilation. When contracted, the pupil is typically pear-shaped, although the bearded seal's is more diagonal. In species that live in shallow water, such as harbor seals and California sea lions, dilation varies little, while the deep-diving elephant seals have much greater variation.|$|E
50|$|Plastic <b>lenses</b> <b>are</b> {{currently}} {{the most commonly}} prescribed lens, owing to their relative safety, low cost, ease of production, and high optical quality. The main drawbacks of many types of plastic <b>lenses</b> <b>are</b> the ease by which a <b>lens</b> can <b>be</b> scratched, and the limitations and costs of producing higher-index <b>lenses.</b> CR-39 <b>lenses</b> <b>are</b> an exception in that they have inherent scratch resistance.|$|R
50|$|A {{whole range}} of <b>lens</b> <b>were</b> made for the SL35 series, and the <b>lens</b> <b>were</b> {{interchangeable}} between the camera bodies in the series. Most of the <b>lenses</b> <b>were</b> German made Carl Zeiss lenses, but apart from the Carl Zeiss lenses, the SL35 range also used the Schneider lens, the Rollei lens and the Rolleinar lens.|$|R
50|$|Konica SLR {{interchangeable}} <b>lenses</b> <b>were</b> named Hexanon. The optical {{quality of}} most Hexanon <b>lenses</b> <b>is</b> regarded as truly superb, particularly the older fixed-focal length (prime) lenses. Many camera manufacturers of interchangeable lenses produce a few great lenses among their line, but Konica managed to achieve near excellent quality over {{a broad range}} of focal lengths in lens tests conducted by several photographic publications over the years. Hexanon <b>lenses</b> <b>were</b> used by the Japanese government as the standard against which all other <b>lenses</b> <b>were</b> measured.|$|R
5|$|However, {{their efforts}} {{result in the}} {{destruction}} of the ship, and Reala uses the energy of the Lens to send them through time again. They appear in an alternate timeline where the War of Heaven and Earth was won by the underground dwellers, and Barbatos and Elrane are hailed as saviors. Traveling back to the time of the War, when the initial interference was caused, they ally with Harold Belselius to return history to its proper state. While they are successful and Barbatos is felled, Elrane continues to distort history in her favor. Confronting her one last time, she is defeated, then they are confronted by Fortuna. Defeating her, the group realize {{that the only way to}} correct the distorted timeline is to destroy the Lens that forms Fortuna's life source, which will mean Reala will be erased from history. When Reala comes to terms with this and gives her blessing, Kyle destroys Fortuna's Lens, which erases all the changes wrought by her agents and returns the timeline to its original state, sending everyone back to their original times and conditions. In the corrected timeline, Kyle, now raised and trained by both Stahn and Rutee, goes on a journey to the temple where he first met Reala. While her <b>Lens</b> <b>is</b> missing, Kyle's strong will succeeds in bringing Reala back into existence and restoring his memories of her.|$|E
25|$|If the <b>lens</b> <b>is</b> biconcave or plano-concave, a {{collimated}} {{beam of light}} passing through the <b>lens</b> <b>is</b> diverged (spread); the <b>lens</b> <b>is</b> thus called a negative or diverging lens. The beam, after passing through the lens, appears to emanate from a particular point on the axis {{in front of the}} lens. The distance from this point to the <b>lens</b> <b>is</b> also known as the focal length, though it is negative with respect to the focal length of a converging lens.|$|E
25|$|A bionic contact <b>lens</b> <b>is</b> {{a digital}} contact lens worn {{directly}} on the human eye which in the future, scientists believe could one day serve as a useful virtual platform for activities such as surfing the World Wide Web, superimposing images on real-world objects, playing video games for entertainment, and for monitoring patients' medical conditions. The bionic contact <b>lens</b> <b>is</b> a form of nanotechnology and microfabrication constructed of light emitting diodes, an antenna, and electronic circuit wiring. The bionic contact <b>lens</b> <b>is</b> the 2008 creation of Iranian-American Babak Parviz, an electrical engineer at the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lenses</b> <b>are</b> {{interchangeable}} {{with the}} K bayonet mount, {{and a series}} of SMC Pentax-M compact <b>lenses</b> <b>were</b> introduced during the lifetime of the M series models.|$|R
50|$|Angle-supported intraocular <b>lenses</b> <b>are</b> {{a special}} kind of intraocular <b>lens</b> that can <b>be</b> {{implanted}} surgically into the anterior chamber of the eye. These <b>lenses</b> <b>are</b> called angle-supported because the footplates of the lens rest in the irido-corneal angle.|$|R
5000|$|Micro — Micro-Nikkor <b>lenses</b> <b>are</b> {{capable of}} high {{reproduction}} ratios, typically 1:2 or 1:1, for macro photography. The first Micro-Nikkor <b>lenses</b> <b>were</b> created for producing microforms of Kanji text.|$|R
25|$|Even if a <b>lens</b> <b>is</b> {{designed}} to minimize or eliminate the aberrations described above, the image quality is still {{limited by the}} diffraction of light passing through the lens' finite aperture. A diffraction-limited <b>lens</b> <b>is</b> one in which aberrations {{have been reduced to}} the point where the image quality is primarily limited by diffraction under the design conditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{horizontal}} {{structure of}} each <b>lens</b> <b>is</b> influenced by {{variations in the}} type and porosity of the subsurface deposits, which on Diego Garcia are minor. At depth, the <b>lens</b> <b>is</b> globular; near the surface, it generally conforms {{to the shape of}} the island. When a Ghyben-Herzberg <b>lens</b> <b>is</b> fully formed, its floating nature will push a freshwater head above mean sea level, and if the island is wide enough, the depth of the lens below mean sea level will be 40 times the height of the water table above sea level. On Diego Garcia, this equates to a maximum depth of 20 m. However, the actual size and depth of each <b>lens</b> <b>is</b> dependent on the width and shape of the island at that point, the permeability of the aquifer, and the equilibrium between recharging rainfall and losses to evaporation to the atmosphere, transpiration by plants, tidal advection, and human use.|$|E
25|$|If the <b>lens</b> <b>is</b> {{biconvex}} or plano-convex, a {{collimated beam}} of light passing through the lens converges to a spot (a focus) behind the lens. In this case, the <b>lens</b> <b>is</b> called a positive or converging lens. The distance from the lens to the spot is the focal length of the lens, which is commonly abbreviated f in diagrams and equations.|$|E
50|$|Construction {{began in}} 1787 at the {{directive}} of George Washington, and was completed on January 10, 1791 using a fund of 1,500 dollars established by him. Whale oil lamps were originally used for illumination. In 1855, following {{formation of the}} Lighthouse Board, a fourth-order Fresnel <b>lens</b> <b>was</b> installed; that <b>lens</b> <b>was</b> replaced by a second-order Fresnel <b>lens,</b> which <b>was</b> replaced later by an aero beacon in 1958. That <b>lens</b> <b>was</b> updated with an DCB-224 aero beacon in 1991.|$|R
50|$|Bass Harbor's fifth order Fresnel <b>lens</b> <b>was</b> {{replaced}} in 1902 {{with a larger}} fourth order. This <b>lens</b> <b>was</b> manufactured by the French company Henry-Lepaute. This lens remains in service today.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s and 1970s the Nikon GN <b>lens</b> <b>was</b> {{a notable}} example, {{while in the}} 1970s and 1980s pancake <b>lenses</b> <b>were</b> used in compact single lens reflex (SLR) cameras.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} 1878 <b>lens</b> <b>is</b> {{on display}} in the Court House Museum of Port Douglas.|$|E
25|$|Make {{sure the}} soft <b>lens</b> <b>is</b> not {{inserted}} inside-out. Edge of a lens {{turned inside out}} has a different appearance, especially when the <b>lens</b> <b>is</b> slightly folded. Insertion of an inside-out lens {{for a brief time}} (less than one minute) should not cause any damage to the eye. Some brands of lenses have markings (e.g. numbers) on the rim that make it easier to tell the front of the lens from the back.|$|E
25|$|A {{minor use}} is in contact lens hygiene – a few lens-cleaning {{products}} disinfect the lens using a hydrogen peroxide solution; a solution containing catalase is {{then used to}} decompose the hydrogen peroxide before the <b>lens</b> <b>is</b> used again.|$|E
25|$|Under Natan's leadership, the {{anamorphic}} film camera <b>lens</b> <b>was</b> developed. The anamorphic <b>lens</b> <b>was</b> {{not only a}} major advance in film technology, but helped Hollywood survive {{during the early years}} of television.|$|R
25|$|Historically, {{hard contact}} <b>lenses</b> <b>were</b> {{frequently}} made of this material. Soft contact <b>lenses</b> <b>are</b> often {{made of a}} related polymer, where acrylate monomers containing one or more hydroxyl groups make them hydrophilic.|$|R
