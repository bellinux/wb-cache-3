With the {{development}} of 300 m super-high dams are built in the southwest of China, reservoir water gravity will make the settlement of the reservoir basin, which will make dam <b>tilt</b> <b>upstream.</b> In the paper, reservoir settlement will be studied in-depth {{on the basis of}} monitoring data analysis and numerical simulation comprehensively. First, reservoir basin will be sinking with the rising of the upstream water gradually according to level monitoring data. Second, those affect factors of FEM calculation have been explored comparatively, such as displacement modes, element geometry and boundary conditions. Third, reservoir, dam and foundation are integrated into a whole to establish a wide spread finite element model. At last, reservoir deformation and its influence factors are determined through the simulation of the bedrock depth, the extending length of the upstream and downstream and different water levels. Those methods have been applied into an engineering project and analysis results show that the settlement of the reservoir will make high arch dam <b>tilt</b> <b>upstream,</b> the higher of the water level, the larger of the horizontal displacement. Accordingly, reservoir deformation should be considered deeply on the appraisement of super-high arch dam operating status in future...|$|R

In slow-moving water, they build a straight dam, whereas in fast-moving water they tend to be curved. Spillways and passageways are built into the dam to allow excess water to drain off without damaging it. Dams are generally built wider at the base and the top is usually <b>tilted</b> <b>upstream</b> to resist the force of the current. Beavers can transport their own weight in material; they drag logs along mudslides and float them through canals to get them in place. Once the dam has flooded enough area to the proper depth to form a protective moat for the lodge (often covering many acres), beavers begin construction on the lodge.|$|R

40|$|The linear {{perturbations}} evolving on streamwise {{boundary layer}} streaks which yield maxi-mum energy growth are computed. The steady and spanwise periodic streaks {{arising from the}} nonlinear saturation of optimally growing streamwise vortices are considered as base °ow. It is shown that signi¯cant transient growth may occur for both sinuous antisym-metric perturbations and for varicose symmetric modes. The energy growth is observed at amplitudes signi¯cantly below the threshold beyond which the streaks become lin-early unstable and is largest for sinuous perturbations, to which the base °ow considered ¯rst become unstable. The optimal initial condition consists of velocity perturbations localised in the regions of highest shear of the streak base °ow, <b>tilted</b> <b>upstream</b> from the wall. The optimal response is still localised {{in the areas of}} largest shear but it is tilted in the °ow direction. The most ampli¯ed perturbations closely resemble the un-stable eigenfunctions obtained for streaks of higher amplitudes.

40|$|Sedimentation in the {{upstream}} {{reaches of}} incised valleys is predominantly fluvial and mostly out from any relative sea level fluctuations. Here, {{the dynamics of}} facies distribution respond to an interaction of tectonics and climate. Tectonics can directly influence fluvial aggradation and degradation through local changes in gradient, both longitudinal and transverse to the valley slope. This paper deals with a –Pliocene – Pleistocene fluvial valley fill developed in the northeastern shoulder of the Siena Basin (Northern Apennines, Italy). Valley fill aggradation resulted from the interaction of autogenic dynamics and extensional tectonics manifested by normal and oblique-slip faults parallel and near orthogonal to the valley axis, which generated rises of local fluvial base level. This thesis coupled a classical field approach, which aims at analysing the interaction between longitudinal and lateral alluvial plain tectonic tilting and fluvial sedimentation, and numerical modelling, which focuses on the temporal and spatial validation of tectonic forcing on the studied valley fill and {{on the effects of}} uplift rate on variable-discharge systems. <b>Longitudinal</b> <b>tilting</b> was generated by a transverse, upstream-dipping normal fault that controlled aggradation of fining-upward strata-sets both upstream and downstream of the fault zone. Aggradation in the upstream sector occurred as a backfilling process and predated that in the downstream one, where sediment was stored as a downfilling. Lateral tilting, spacing out the aggradations, was governed by the interaction between fault-generated subsidence and the topographic confinement of progradational, flank-sourced alluvial fans. Both <b>longitudinal</b> and lateral <b>tilting</b> anomalies are easily recorded in sedimentary succession generated by high-discharge system disturbed by high uplift rates. ...|$|R

Segregation of a multi-dispersed population of grains is assessed using a comprehensive numerical framework integrating Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations with a Discrete Element Method (DEM) setup in the open-source software OpenFOAM. We have carried out combined qualitative and quantitative assessments of process conditions, such as deck shape, deck inclination (longitudinal and transverse), vibration speed and fluidizing air velocities at the surface. We assess the performance of our framework by employing a quantitative metric rhostat, which represents the efficiency of separation in terms of density {{differences between the two}} separated product fractions. Additionally, qualitative flow behaviour is evaluated by examining relevant velocity and material distribution trends. We show that these separation profiles are highly sensitive to changes in the design and process conditions, with the presence of discernible optimal operating points.

An experimental program at Purdue University {{was conducted to}} investigate {{the characteristics of a}} tangential sump design. The research employed a bespoke experimental rig consisting of modular transparent chamber to allow unprecedented view of the two-phase flow inside the bearing chamber. It was found that a persistent liquid pooling near the drain entrance of a tangential sump obstructs the outflow to the scavenge off-take. While space requirement is minimal, the scavenge performance of a tangential sump is poor. A prototype advanced sump was proposed and built with features to address various issues found in the tangential sump. In this paper, further experimental work on the refinements of the advanced sump is presented.

Simultaneous measurements from a 2 µm Doppler lidar and a 0. 5 µm backscatter lidar are combined to analyse the occurrence, or not, {{of internal}} gravity waves in the residual layer during the morning transition on two days, 10 and 14 June 2005. Three cases are studied for illustrating three different flow configurations in the residual layer: no wave, evanescent wave and propagating wave. Comparison of the three cases suggests two necessary conditions for the generation of gravity waves: a stably stratified residual layer and a convective boundary layer with mechanical forcing frequencies less than the Brunt-Vaïsala frequency. The horizontal wind shear probably {{plays a role in}} the dynamics of the waves, but, in the cases analysed, it is not sufficient alone to generate the observed waves through the obstacle effect. In the case of wave propagation, the waves <b>tilt</b> <b>upstream</b> and against the wind shear, with a typical horizontal wavelength and a line phase direction with respect to the vertical of 2. 4 km and 32 °, respectively.

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} global optimal {{dynamics of}} a flat-plate boundary layer is studied {{by means of}} an adjoint-based optimization in a spatial domain of long – but finite – streamwise dimension. The localized optimal initial perturbation is characterized by a pair of streamwise-modulated counter-rotating vortices, <b>tilted</b> <b>upstream,</b> yielding at the optimal time elongated streaks of alternating sign in the streamwise direction. This indicates that perturbations with non-zero streamwise wavenumber have a role in the transient dynamics of a boundary layer. A scaling law is provided, describing the variation of the streamwise modulation of the optimal initial perturbation with respect to the streamwise domain length and to the Reynolds number. For spanwise-extended domains, a near-optimal three-dimensional perturbation is extracted during the optimization process; it is localized also in the spanwise direction, resulting in a wave packet of elongated disturbances modulated in the spanwise and streamwise directions. The nonlinear evolution of the optimal and near-optimal perturbations is investigated by means of direct numerical simulations. Both perturbations are found to induce transition at lower levels of the initial energy than local optimal and suboptimal perturbations. Moreover, it is observed that transition occurs in a well-defined region of the convected wave packet, close to its centre, via a mechanism including at the same time oscillations of the streaks of both quasi-sinuous and quasi-varicose nature.

40|$|Abstract. A {{two-dimensional}} cochlear {{model is}} presented, which couples the classical second order partial differential equations of the basilar membrane (BM) with a discrete feed-forward (FF) outer hair cell (OHC) model for enhanced sensitivity. The enhancement (gain) {{factor in the}} model depends on BM displacement in a nonlinear nonlocal manner in order to capture multifrequency sound interactions and compression effects in a time-dependent simulation. The FF mechanism {{is based on the}} <b>longitudinal</b> <b>tilt</b> of the OHCs in feeding the mechanical energy onto the BM. A numerical method of second order accuracy in space and time is formulated by reducing the unknown variables to the BM with the representation of eigenfunction expansions. Though the nonlinear coupling with OHCs created an implicit algebraic problem at each time step, the structure of the FF mass matrix is found to permit a decomposition into a sum of a time-independent symmetric positive definite part and the remaining time-dependent part. A fast iterative method is devised and shown to converge with only the inversion of the time-independent part of the mass matrix. The time-dependent computation is studied by comparing with steady state solutions (frequency domain solutions) in the linear regime and by a convergence study in the nonlinear regime. Results are shown on OHC amplification of BM responses, compressive output for large intensity input, and nonlinear multitone interactions such as tonal suppression, noise suppression, and distortion products.

Outcrop data of deformed latest Miocene and younger strata are combined with observations of warped and faulted late Quaternary terrace surfaces to unravel the geomorphic and structural history of the Huangarua River valley. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of loess that accumulated on these strath terraces and paleosol stratigraphy allow temporal correlation among the terraces and with glacial climate cycles since the Last Interglaciation. These data indicate that five intervals of strath cutting occurred, at f 125, 60 – 70, f 30, f 15, and < 10 ka. Strath beveling is largely independent of local folding or regional base-level change.

Applying the lubrication approximation for the averaged motion we obtain the amplitude equation, which includes contributions from gravity, van der Waals attraction, surface tension, and the vibration. We show that the longitudinal vibration leads to destabilization of the initially planar film. Stable solutions corresponding to the deflected free surface are possible in this case. Linear analysis {{in the case of}} tilted vibration shows that either stabilization or destabilization are possible. Stabilization of the dewetting film by mechanical action (i. e., the vibration) was first reported by us in PRE 77, 036320 (2008). This effect may be important for applications...|$|R

The reponse of the sensors under moderated <b>longitudinal</b> and transversal <b>tilts</b> is studied and intrinsic performance is extracted. (To be submitted to Nucl. Instr. and Methods A) a) Under CICYT (Spain) grant: AEN 97 - 1694 b) Under CICYT (Spain) grant: AEN 97 - 1689 1 Introduction In the current alignment scheme for the CMS experiment [1] the OE coordinate will be monitored using Laser Level boxes [2]. The Laser Level boxes contain mainly a laser source and a tiltmeter. The tiltmeters will measure the OE angle with respect to the gravity and will allow to connect the measurements between the Tracker [3] and Muon Chambers Systems [2]. Tracker and muon detectors must be aligned with a precision better than 20 rad in the bending plane. The tiltmeters investigated in the present work were manufactured by Applied Geomechanics Incorpora [...] ...|$|R
