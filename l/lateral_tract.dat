2500|$|In a {{longitudinal}} osteofibrous canal {{on either side}} of the spine there is a group of muscles called the erector spinae which is subdivided into a lateral superficial and a medial deep tract. [...] In the <b>lateral</b> <b>tract,</b> the iliocostalis lumborum and longissimus thoracis originates on the back of the sacrum and the posterior part of the iliac crest. Contracting these muscles bilaterally extends the spine and unilaterally contraction bends the spine to the same side. [...] The medial tract has a [...] "straight" [...] (interspinales, intertransversarii, and spinalis) and an [...] "oblique" [...] (multifidus and semispinalis) component, both of which stretch between vertebral processes; the former acts similar to the muscles of the <b>lateral</b> <b>tract,</b> while the latter function unilaterally as spine extensors and bilaterally as spine rotators. In the medial tract, the multifidi originates on the sacrum.|$|E
50|$|The {{function}} of {{lower motor neurons}} {{can be divided into}} two different groups: the lateral corticospinal tract and the anterior cortical spinal tract. The <b>lateral</b> <b>tract</b> contains upper motor neuronal axons which synapse on dorsal lateral (DL) lower motor neurons. The DL neurons are involved in distal limb control. Therefore, these DL neurons are found specifically only in the cervical and lumbosacral enlargements within the spinal cord. There is no decussation in the lateral corticospinal tract after the decussation at the medullary pyramids.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{divisions}} of the corticospinal tract, the lateral corticospinal tract and the anterior corticospinal tract. The lateral corticospinal tract neurons cross the midline in the spinal cord, and controls the limbs and digits. The <b>lateral</b> <b>tract</b> forms about 90% of connections in the corticospinal tract; most of these (about 80% of the total neurons) cross over in the medulla, while the rest (about 10% of the total) cross over at their corresponding place in the spinal cord. The anterior corticospinal tract neurons, the remaining 10%, stay {{on the same side}} of the body, and control the trunk muscles.|$|E

40|$|In the {{honeybee}} brain, {{two prominent}} tracts – the medial and the lateral antennal lobe tract – project {{from the primary}} olfactory center, the antennal lobes (ALs), to the central brain, the mushroom bodies (MBs), and the protocerebral lobe (PL). Intracellularly stained uniglomerular projection neurons were reconstructed, registered to the 3 D honeybee standard brain atlas, and then used to derive the spatial properties and quantitative morphology of the neurons of both tracts. We evaluated putative synaptic contacts of projection neurons (PNs) using confocal microscopy. Analysis of the patterns of axon terminals revealed a domain-like innervation within the MB lip neuropil. PNs of the <b>lateral</b> <b>tract</b> arborized more sparsely within the lips and exhibited fewer synaptic boutons, while medial tract neurons occupied broader regions in the MB calyces and the PL. Our data show that uPNs from the medial and <b>lateral</b> <b>tract</b> innervate both the core and the cortex of the ipsilateral MB lip but differ in their innervation patterns in these regions. In the mushroombody neuropil collar we found evidence for ALT boutons suggesting the collar as a multi modal input site including olfactory input similar to lip and basal ring. In addition, our data support the conclusion drawn in previous studies that reciprocal synapses exist between PNs, octopaminergic-, and GABAergic cells in the MB calyces. For the first time, we found evidence for connections between both tracts within the AL...|$|E
40|$|To explore {{fundamental}} principles characterizing chemosensory information processing, {{we have identified}} antennal-lobe projection neurons in the heliothine moth, including several neuron types not previously described. Generally, odor information is conveyed from the primary olfactory center of the moth brain, the antennal lobe, to higher brain centers via projection neuron axons passing along several parallel pathways, of which the medial, mediolateral, and lateral antennal-lobe tract are considered the classical ones. Recent data have revealed the projections of the individual tracts more in detail demonstrating three main target regions in the protocerebrum; the calyces are innervated mainly by the medial tract, the superior intermediate protocerebrum by the <b>lateral</b> <b>tract</b> exclusively, and the lateral horn by all tracts. In the present study, we have identified, via iontophoretic intracellular staining combined with confocal microscopy, individual projection neurons confined to the tracts mentioned above, plus two additional ones. Further, using the visualization software AMIRA, we reconstructed the stained neurons and registered the models into a standard brain atlas, which allowed us to compare the termination areas of individual projection neurons both across and within distinct tracts. The data demonstrate a morphological diversity of the projection neurons within distinct tracts. Comparison of the output areas of the neurons confined to the three main tracts in the lateral horn showed overlapping terminal regions for the medial and mediolateral tracts; the <b>lateral</b> <b>tract</b> neurons, on the contrary, targeted mostly other output areas in the protocerebrum...|$|E
40|$|The {{olfactory}} tract in {{crucian carp}} (Carassius carassius) {{is divided into}} three distinct bundles: the <b>lateral</b> <b>tract</b> (LOT) and the lateral (lMOT) and medial (mMOT) bundles of the medial tract. The LOT has been shown to mediate information associated with feeding behavior, whereas the mMOT mediates information associated with alarm response. The role of the medial olfactory tract (lMOT and mMOT) in reproductive behavior is still under debate. In the present experiment, male reproductive behavior towards prostaglandin-injected females was investigated before and after cutting off the different olfactory tract bundles, to determine which of the tract bundles is essential for mediating reproductive behavior in male crucian carp. The fish were maintained in physiological saline before and after surgery to preserve the remaining tract bundles. Operations were performed symmetrically on both sides and post-operative inspections revealed the functionality of the intact tracts. Sham-operated males and males with only the lMOT intact showed typical reproductive behavior, with following of the female and inspections of the female anal papilla. However, males in which the lMOT was cut, leaving both the mMOT and the LOT intact, showed reduced reproductive behavior. Our results suggest that the lMOT mediates reproductive behavior in male crucian carp...|$|E

40|$|Most sharks have {{well-developed}} olfactory {{systems and}} depend {{to a large}} degree on odor information to locate food, home and navigate, and possibly detect predators and mates. The aim of this investigation is to determine the behavioral function of two paired bilateral olfactory bulbs in the smooth dogfish shark, Mustelus canis. The paired olfactory bulbs are a rare and unique feature among elasmobranchs and are absent in bony fishes. Given that the olfactory system of bony fishes contains lateral and medial nerve bundles with behavioral functions in feeding and social behavior respectively, we hypothesize that sharks have an elaborate functional division in which the medial bulb is processing social odors and the lateral bulb food odors. This functional division would parallel the division into an olfactory and an accessory olfactory system, also known as the vomeronasal organ or Jacobson’s organ, which evolved in tetrapods. Our study is based on the behavioral effects of selective transection of the two olfactory tracts to reveal how the brain is processing input from two anatomically distinct olfactory systems. The results show that animals with <b>lateral</b> <b>tract</b> transections showed impaired ability to track a food odor plume while those with medial transections showed no change. Attempts to identify a reliable social odor (pheromone) were not successful, preventing us from determining the deficits expected from medial tract lesions...|$|E

40|$|N-Acetylaspartylglutamate, an {{endogenous}} brain peptide {{that binds}} with high affinity to a subpopulation of glutamate-binding sites in rat brain, is excitatory on rat piriform cortex pyramidal cells studied in a perfused brain slice. Both the monosynaptic excitation of the pyramidal cells elicited by {{stimulation of the}} <b>lateral</b> olfactory <b>tract</b> and the response to N-acetylaspartylglutamate were blocked by DL- 2 -amino- 4 -phosphonobutyrate but not by other excitatory amino acid antagonists. Responses to glutamate and aspartate, previously considered to be candidates as the <b>lateral</b> olfactory <b>tract</b> transmitter, were unaffected by 2 -amino- 4 -phosphonobutyrate. Three days after unilateral bulbectomy {{there was a significant}} decrease in concentrations of N-acetylaspartylglutamate as well as aspartate, N-acetylaspartate, and gamma-aminobutyrate in the pyriform cortex of the side from which the olfactory bulb had been removed.

50|$|Loss of {{pain and}} {{temperature}} are due to damage to the <b>lateral</b> spinothalamic <b>tracts,</b> which cross {{the central part of}} the cord close to the level where they enter it and travel up the spinal column on the opposite side to the one they innervate (i.e. they ascend contralaterally). Note that a lesion of the <b>lateral</b> spinothalamic <b>tract</b> at a given level will not result in sensory loss for the dermatome of the same level; this is due to the fibers of the tract of Lissauer which transmit the neuron one or two levels above the affected segment (thus bypassing the segmental lesion on the contralateral side).|$|R

40|$|Extracellular pH and P-O 2 was {{recorded}} in the isolated in vitro brainstem of the metamorphic tadpole, Rana catesbeiana while the brainstem preparation was superfused with oxygenated mock cerebrospinal fluid of pH = 7. 8, P-CO 2 = 17 Torr, P-O 2 = 600 Torr at 23 degrees C. Using pH and P-O 2 microelectrodes, the ventral medullary surface was penetrated at midline and lateral sites between cranial nerves V and X. Mean pH and P-O 2 gradients of 0. 07 pH units/ 100 mu m and 60 Torr/ 100 mu m were detected in the superfusate, 100 - 200 mu m above the ventral surface of the brainstem. These gradients remained virtually constant for the first 100 - 200 mu m below the medullary surface. Beyond this level, pH and P-O 2 gradients decreased in a curvilinear fashion. For midline tracts, minimum values of pH and P-O 2 (7. 58 +/- 0. 05 and 323 +/- 31 Torr) were reached {{at a depth of}} 500 - 750 mu m, whereas for <b>lateral</b> <b>tracts,</b> mean minimum values of pH and P-O 2 (7. 34 +/- 0. 12 and 240 +/- 68 Torr), were recorded at 850 - 900 mu m.
