5|$|In a <b>laboratory</b> <b>experiment,</b> {{the average}} {{lifespan}} {{for a male}} Campbell's dwarf hamster in captivity was 278 days and for a female was 356 days.

Young hamsters provided widely varied diets early in life are less likely to suffer digestive problems as they mature, but this is not always possible in the wild due to lack of food; this causes the life expectancy of captive hamsters to be greater than that of wild hamsters.|$|E

5|$|Adaptation {{may cause}} either the gain {{of a new}} feature, or the loss of an ancestral feature. An example that shows both types of change is {{bacterial}} adaptation to antibiotic selection, with genetic changes causing antibiotic resistance by both modifying {{the target of the}} drug, or increasing the activity of transporters that pump the drug out of the cell. Other striking examples are the bacteria Escherichia coli evolving the ability to use citric acid as a nutrient in a long-term <b>laboratory</b> <b>experiment,</b> Flavobacterium evolving a novel enzyme that allows these bacteria to grow on the by-products of nylon manufacturing, and the soil bacterium Sphingobium evolving an entirely new metabolic pathway that degrades the synthetic pesticide pentachlorophenol. An interesting but still controversial idea is that some adaptations might increase the ability of organisms to generate genetic diversity and adapt by natural selection (increasing organisms' evolvability).|$|E

25|$|In September 2010, {{a signal}} that {{is closely related to}} black hole Hawking {{radiation}} (see analog gravity) was claimed to have been observed in a <b>laboratory</b> <b>experiment</b> involving optical light pulses.

25|$|Through a <b>laboratory</b> <b>experiment,</b> it was {{discovered}} that the quality of the food Vespula vulgaris consumes directly affects its body temperature. The higher the quality of the prey, measured by the amount of sucrose present in the food, the higher thorax temperature it had. Such high thorax temperature indicates the wasp's excitement and motivation to collect the offered food. The wasps will want to absorb as much energy as possible because the output of the energy directly coordinates to the power of flight muscles. Higher thorax temperature therefore means more power in thoracic flight muscles, leading to faster movement and in overall, more foraging.|$|E
25|$|Although females often {{instigate}} sexual cannibalism, reversed sexual cannibalism {{has been}} observed in Micaria sociabilis and Allocosa brasiliensis. In a <b>laboratory</b> <b>experiment</b> on M. sociabilis, males preferred to eat older females. This behavior may be interpreted as adaptive foraging, because older females have low reproductive potential and food may be limited. Reversed cannibalism in M. sociabilis may also be influenced by size dimorphism. Males and females are similar sizes, and bigger males {{were more likely to}} be cannibalistic. In A. brasiliensis males tend to be cannibalistic in between mating seasons, after they have mated, gone out of their burrows to search for food, and left their mates in their burrows. Any females they cross during this period likely have little reproductive value, so this may also be interpreted as adaptive foraging.|$|E

500|$|Stephen King's novella Apt Pupil {{begins in}} 1974, when Todd Bowden is in junior high, and it ends with him {{graduating from high}} school. In Bryan Singer's film, the story takes place fully in 1984, when Todd Bowden is in his last year in high school. In the novella, for three years leading {{to the end of}} the story, Todd Bowden and {{discovered}} Nazi war criminal Kurt Dussander independently murder a large number of hobos and transients, whereas in the film, the murders are condensed to Dussander's attempt to kill the hobo Archie. Singer sought to reduce the novella's violence, not wanting it to appear [...] "exploitative or repetitive". [...] Unlike in the novella, animosity toward Jews was not explicitly displayed by the characters in the film. [...] The novella's dream sequence in which Bowden rapes a sixteen-year-old Jewish virgin as a <b>laboratory</b> <b>experiment</b> under Dussander's guidance was replaced by the film's dream sequence in which Bowden sees three shower-gas chamber scenes unfold. Reduced in the film was Todd's encounter with the schoolgirl Betty (named Becky in the film). In the novella, he dreams of Betty as a concentration camp inmate who he can rape and torture. In the film, he has a brief encounter with Becky where he finds himself unable to perform sexually.|$|E
