40|$|Objectives: Validation of choroidal {{thickness}} {{and other}} biometrics measured by spectral domain {{optical coherence tomography}} (SD-OCT) in predicting <b>lacquer</b> cracks formation in highly myopic eyes. Methods: Patients with a refractive error worse than − 8 diopters and moderate myopic maculopathy were recruited into two groups based on {{the presence or absence}} of <b>lacquer</b> cracks (36 eyes without and 33 eyes with <b>lacquer</b> cracks). Choroidal thickness, refractive error, and axial length were measured and subjected to receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to identify the optimal cutoff values at predicting <b>lacquer</b> crack formation. The width of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), RPE to the inner segment/outer segment line, RPE to the external limiting membrane were also measured and compared to the subfoveal choroidal thickness to assess their relationships as potential markers of <b>lacquer</b> crack formation. Results: <b>Lacquer</b> crack is associated with decreased choroidal thickness, lower best-corrected visual acuity, longer axial length and higher refractive errors. Choroidal thickness has the strongest association with <b>lacquer</b> crack formation versus axial length and refractive error. In eyes with <b>lacquer</b> cracks, stellate <b>lacquer</b> cracks are associated with thinner choroidal thickness compared to eyes with linear <b>lacquer</b> cracks. Subfoveal choroidal thickness less than the width of the retinal pigment epithelium to the inner segment/outer segment line is also associated with <b>lacquer</b> crack formation (sensitivity 78. 8 %, specificity 88. 3 %, and accuracy 81. 2 %).
