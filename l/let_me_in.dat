[...] Acclaimed horror author Stephen King wrote [...] "Let Me In is a genre-busting triumph. Not just a horror film, but the best American horror film in the last 20 years." [...] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal wrote that the film [...] "is more than a respectful remake; 'Let Me In' is quietly stylish and thoroughly chilling in its own right." ...|$|E

500|$|<b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>In</b> was {{not well}} {{received}} by all critics. Some disputed Reeves' claims {{that he was not}} remaking the film but re-adapting the book, criticizing it for being too similar to the Swedish film. Josh Tyler wrote [...] "The movie he’s made is absolutely a direct remake of the 2008 film, the two are so similar that it’s almost impossible to differentiate between them." [...] In a similar vein, Jamie S. Rich noted that while there was plenty of content in the original novel that the Swedish film omitted, [...] "Reeves hasn't really ferreted out anything new; on the contrary, there is actually less plot in <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>In</b> than in the Alfredson version." [...] Beth Accomando wrote, [...] "How Reeves can take the credit 'written and directed by Matt Reeves' seems almost laughable when you note how similar the script and the direction are to the original." [...] In comparing the two films, she opined that the remake [...] "makes obvious all that the original film made subtle and does so with less complexity." [...] Mark Kermode called it [...] "the most utterly redundant remake of the year".|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of Let the Right One In took place, Cloverfield {{director}} Matt Reeves signed on to write and direct an English-language version for Overture Films and Hammer Films.

Alfredson has expressed unhappiness {{about the idea of}} a remake, saying that [...] "Remakes should be made of movies that aren't very good, that gives you the chance to fix whatever has gone wrong" [...] and expressing concern that the end result would be too mainstream. Alfredson was initially asked to direct the remake, but he turned it down stating that [...] "I am too old to make the same film twice and I have other stories that I want to tell." [...] Lindqvist, in contrast, said that he had heard that Reeves [...] "will make a new film based on the book, and not remake the Swedish film" [...] and so [...] "it'll be something completely different, but it's going to be really interesting to see." [...] Hammer Films producer Simon Oakes referred to the project as a remake of the film and later not as a remake, but just as [...] "Reeves' version". <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>In</b> was released in late 2010 starring Chloë Grace Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee as Abby and Owen, Eli's and Oskar's respective counterparts, and received very positive reviews but under-performed at the box office.|$|E

500|$|The {{rights for}} the English-language film were later {{acquired}} by Hammer Films at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival, where Let the Right One In won the [...] "Founders Award for Best Narrative Feature," [...] and Matt Reeves was quickly introduced as the director. John Nordling and Carl Molinder, the Swedish producers of the original film, were both involved as producers for the adaptation. Tomas Alfredson, {{the director of the}} Swedish film, was initially asked to direct the remake, but he turned it down stating that [...] "I am too old to make the same film twice and I have other stories that I want to tell." [...] Hammer Films producer Simon Oakes initially referred to the film with [...] "If you call it a faithful remake, I think that's true to say that's what it is. It's not a reimagining; the same beats , maybe the scares are a little bit more scary." [...] He later said, [...] "I call it his [...] version. I don't call it his remake or his re-imagining of it." [...] The decision to make a new film adaptation has been criticized by Tomas Alfredson. He has stated on numerous occasions that he is not in favor of remaking his film. [...] "If one should remake a film, it's because the original is bad. And I don't think mine is," [...] he said. Producer Donna Gigliotti said, [...] "We're incredibly admiring of the original, but to be honest with you, that picture grossed $2 million. It's not like we're remaking Lawrence of Arabia." [...] Producer Simon Oakes {{made it clear that the}} plot of <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>In</b> would closely resemble that of the original film, except that it will be made [...] "very accessible to a wider audience." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{adapting}} the film, a few adjustments were made, such as changing {{the names of}} the protagonists to Owen and Abby, and moving the setting from the Stockholm suburb of Blackeberg to [...] "a small New Mexico town." [...] Reeves was also asked to change the ages of the main characters, but he refused, saying that [...] "would ruin the essence of the story and change everything completely…we need that childlike innocence." [...] He also told his actors to not watch the original film beforehand so [...] "we could make our own version but stay very true to the essence of the story." [...] The filmmakers have noted that [...] "they intend to forge a unique identity for <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>In,</b> placing it firmly in an American context", {{while at the same time}} paying respect to the original. In comparing his adaptation to the Swedish one, Reeves admitted to not adding many different details from the book that weren't in the original film, stating that [...] "the story was so big that you couldn't really add a lot of stuff in without taking away the focus of the coming of age story so I tried to have allusions and references to stuff in the book." [...] Reeves also admitted to borrowing elements from the Swedish film, stating [...] "There are things that [...] adapted brilliantly in the movie and I borrowed from that because I thought he did a great adaptation. But there are some things that hopefully don't detract and fit into the context of the story. It's a mixture of details from the book, the original film and things that grew out of adapting it." [...] In {{adapting the}} story for American audiences, Reeves stated that keeping the 1980s time period within the film was critical in exploring the theme of good and evil. He used Ronald Reagan's [...] "evil empire speech" [...] as an example of American thought during that period. Reeves stated, [...] "The idea of Reagan's 'evil empire' speech and that whole sort of school of thought was that evil was something that was outside of us. Evil was 'Other,' it was over there, it was the Soviets". Reeves felt that this idea was central to the main character Owen, as he [...] "would be grappling with these very, very dark feelings but being in a kind of American town where there was that sort of [...] mindset and religiousness. How would you fit in? How would you feel about yourself being confused and being 12 or 13 years old and not knowing what it means that you wish you could kill those kids who were terrorizing you every day?
