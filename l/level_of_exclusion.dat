In this context, the level of satisfaction of immigrants to the nature and accessibility to all levels of the health system and provided services, the cost and also the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>exclusion</b> of immigrants from these is studied.

30|$|Those ten {{screened}} microsatellite loci exhibited polymorphism and stability, and {{the combined}} probability of exclusion achieved 99.99 % when the seven most polymorphic loci were employed for paternity testing (Figure  1). To {{evaluate the effectiveness}} of a paternity testing system, PE value or CPE value are the major factors in determining the genetic sire of an offspring (Sherman et al. 2004). The degree of relatedness of the candidate sire is also reflected by PE value. Therefore, PE/CPE value reflects the ability of an assay to exclude a candidate sire which is influenced by the number of loci genotyped and heterozygosity of each locus (Xu et al. 2013). The combined probability of exclusion for 10 microsatellite loci exceeded 99.99 % (Table  4), which was slightly higher than that (99.62 %) of 11 microsatellite loci used in paternity testing of Yugoslav pied cattle (Stevanovic et al. 2010) and relatively higher than that of 8 loci (96.60 %) in white-handed gibbon (Hylobates lar) (Chambers et al. 2004). Comparison of our study showed that our selected microsatellite markers had greater power of exclusion, and we could reach a high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>exclusion</b> with only seven loci.|$|E
40|$|African-Americans are overrepresented in felony {{convictions}} and, thus, {{more likely}} to be excluded from jury service. This study examines the potential impact of felon jury exclusion on the proportion of African-Americans that remain eligible for jury service. Results indicate that felon jury exclusion dramatically reduces the pool of eligible African-Americans statewide by nearly one-third. Furthermore, the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>exclusion</b> for all groups is concentrat-ed in areas with higher African-American populations. When limiting the analysis to African-Americans, however, counties with low African-American populations tend to have the highest levels of African-American exclusion. OLS regression models support the notion that the concentration of African-Americans at the county level is a significant factor in all three model specifications. The nature of this relationship, however, changes dramatically across the models. When any large and identifiable segment of the community is excluded from jury service, the effect is to remove from the jury room qualities of human nature and varieties of human expe-rience, the range of which is unknown and perhaps unknowable.

40|$|The {{health and}} rights of populations living in {{informal}} or slum settlements are key development {{issues of the}} twenty-first century. As of 2007, {{the majority of the}} world’s population lives in urban areas. More than one billion of these people, or one in three city-dwellers, live in inadequate housing with no or a few basic resources. In Bangladesh, urban slum settlements tend to be located in low-lying, flood-prone, poorlydrained areas, having limited formal garbage disposal and minimal access to safe water and sanitation. These areas are severely crowded, with 4 - 5 people living in houses of just over 100 sq feet. These conditions of high density of population and poor sanitation exacerbate the spread of diseases. People living in these areas experience social, economic and political exclusion, which bars them from society’s basic resources. This paper overviews policies and actions that impact the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>exclusion</b> of people living in urban slum settlements in Bangladesh, with a focus on improving the health and rights of the urban poor. Despite some strategies adopted to ensure better access to water and health, overall, the country does not have a comprehensive policy for urban slum residents, and the situation remains bleak...|$|E
40|$|A huge {{swath of}} {{parameter}} {{space in the}} context of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) has been ruled at after run I of the LHC. Various exclusion contours in the m_g̃-_χ̃_ 1 ^ 0 plane were derived by the experimental collaborations, all based on three-body gluino decay topologies. These limits are however extremely model dependent and do not always reflect the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>exclusion.</b> If the gluino-neutralino spectrum is compressed, then the current mass limits can be drastically reduced. In such situations, the radiative decay of the gluino g 1 can be dominant and used as a sensitive probe of small mass splittings. We examine the sensitivity of constraints of some Run I experimental searches on this decay after recasting them within the MadAnalysis 5 framework. The recasted searches are now part of the MadAnalysis 5 Public Analysis Database. We also design a dedicated search strategy and investigate its prospects to uncover this decay mode of the gluino at run II of the LHC. We emphasize that a multijet search strategy may be more sensitive than a monojet one, even in the case of very small mass differences. Comment: 34 pages, 6 figures.

The Court has adopted various findings since its first ruling in 1991.

The second part of the article moves beyond a close socio-legal analysis to discuss the significance of the common rule (once inadmissibility decisions are taken into consideration), according to which quasi-nationals are deportable. Nationality law, at the core of the case law, is revealed as a fiction that creates privilege at the same time as it obscures the discriminatory basis of this privilege under the guise of operating a neutral categorisation of human beings.

40|$|By-catch and {{discards}} are {{a common}} problem to all fisheries. Recent studies of the Portuguese crustacean-trawl fishery show that discards average 70 % of the total catch. This situation poses a threat {{not only to the}} management of target and commercial fish by-catch species stocks, but also in terms of the ecosystem impact of the discarded species whose survival is generally low. Previous attempts to address this problem by using oblique separator mesh panels associated with square-mesh windows, or square-mesh windows alone, provided encouraging results, but these are unlikely to have commercial applicability at present. Therefore, we tested the efficiency of a modified Nordmore grid in excluding some of the most captured non-commercial by-catch species, such as the blue whiting, Micromesistius poutassou, and the boarfish, Capros aper, evaluating simultaneously the losses of the crustacean target species (rose shrimp, Parapenaeus longirostris, Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus and red shrimp, Aristeus antennatus) and commercially valuable fish by-catch. A total of 41 valid hauls were carried out during 2001, and 15 in 2002 on board the R/V "Noruega". Results from both years varied considerably, with higher by-catch exclusion rates, in weight, registered in the second survey (73 - 74 and 48 - 63 % for blue whiting and boarfish, respectively). The corresponding percentage reduction for target species was 8 - 15 % for the Norway lobster, 4 - 9 % for rose shrimp and 7 - 10 % for red shrimp. The <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>exclusion</b> of the non-commercial by-catch is encouraging, although short-term loss of Norway lobster, where the escapees comprised larger individuals, raises some concern with regards to fishers' acceptance of mandatory use of grids.

To be of practical use, the assessments need to be quick, consistent and repeatable. The aim of this workshop is to invite attendees to participate in the evaluation of a number of everyday objects using an assessment technique being considered by the workshop organisers. The objectives include evaluating the effectiveness of the assessment method and to suggest revisions to the assessment scales being used. The assessment technique is to be based on the ONS capability measures (1) which recognises 14 capability scales of which seven are particularly pertinent to product evaluation, namely: motion; dexterity; reach and stretch; vision; hearing; communication; and intellectual functioning. Each of these scales range from 0 (fully able) through 1 (minimal impairment) to 10 (severe impairment). The attendees will be asked to rate the products on these scales. Clearly the assessed accessibility of the product depends on the assumptions made about the context of use. The attendees will be asked to clearly note the assumptions that they are making about the context in which the product is being assessed. The aim is to identify how assessors would use the assessment method in the real world. The objects being assessed will include items such as remote controls, and mobile telephones. The attendees will be asked to assess at least two products. Helpers will be on hand to assist and observe. The assessments will be collated and compared and feedback about the method sought from the attendees. Initial conclusions will be presented at the end of the workshop.

40|$|IMPORTANCE: Current {{practice}} to diagnose idiopathic orbital inflammation (IOI) is inconsistent, leading to frequent misdiagnosis of other orbital entities, including cancer. By specifying criteria, diagnosis of orbital inflammation will be improved. OBJECTIVE: To define {{a set of}} criteria specific for the diagnosis of IOI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 3 -round modified Delphi process with an expert panel was conducted from June 8, 2015, to January 25, 2016. Fifty-three orbital scientist experts, identified through membership in the Orbital Society, {{were invited to participate}} in on online survey and they scored, using 5 -point Likert scales, items that are eligible as diagnostic criteria from the literature and from personal experience. The items were clustered around the anatomic subtypes of IOI: idiopathic dacryoadenitis and idiopathic orbital fat inflammation (2 nonmyositic IOIs), and idiopathic orbitalmyositis (myositic IOI). Items with dissensus were rescored in the second round, and all items with consensus (median,≤ 4; interquartile range, ≤ 1) were ranked by importance in the third round. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Consensus on items {{to be included in the}} criteria. RESULTS: Of the 53 experts invited to participate, a multinational panel of 35 (66 %) individuals with a mean (SD) years of experience of 31 (11) years were included. Consensus was achieved on 7 of 14 clinical and radiologic items and 5 of 7 pathologic items related to diagnosis of nonmyositic IOI, and 11 of 14 clinical and radiologic items and 1 of 5 pathologic items formyositic IOI. There was agreement among panelists to focus on surgical tissue biopsy results in the diagnosis of nonmyositic IOI and on a trial with systemic corticosteroids inmyositic IOI. Panelists agreed that a maximum number of 30 IgG 4 -positive plasma cells per high-power field in the orbital tissue is compatible with the diagnosis of IOI. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: An international panel of experts endorsed consensus diagnostic criteria of IOI. These criteria define a <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>exclusion</b> suggested for diagnosis and include tissue biopsy for lesions not confined to the extraocular muscles.

40|$|This {{research}} maps out separate {{provision for}} pupils with SEBD in Scotland and investigates {{the experience of}} pupils in such provision. The mapping study used a postal questionnaire which provided, for the first time, {{a picture of the}} sector in terms of who is running it, their sense of purpose, the curriculum on offer, the background of pupils, links with mainstream schools, and attitudes towards evaluating effectiveness. Some findings were predictable, such as the social background and gender mix of pupils, but others were more surprising, such as the high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>exclusion</b> and low number of schools which viewed reintegration as a key purpose. To investigate pupil experience of separate provision interviews were carried out with a total of fourteen pupils from two different schools. These interviews addressed specific questions relating to curriculum, educational experi nce, ethos and stigmatisation. In this thesis Symbolic Interactionism is used as a theoretical lens through which to examine pupil experience. It became clear that whether a pupil experiences re-signification or stigmatisation is not a straightforward matter, but depends on staff attitudes and peer relationships. The ethos of schools emerged as of fundamental importance, and as something which appears to exist independently of the type of curriculum on offer. Perhaps most significantly the importance of the curriculum and of receiving a 'mainstream' education, to even the most disaffected pupils, emerged. The findings from both the questionnaire and pupil interviews are discussed in terms of the emerging themes of 'separateness', 'vulnerability' and 'diversity'. In particular the difficulties encountered by an 'exclusionary' service in an age of inclusion are examined. It is argued that the current system leads to stigmatisation of the sector and the people who work in it. In addition, the impact of the persisting tension between welfare and punishment approaches to pupils with SEBD is noted throughout the thesis. This research provides new knowledge about this sector. This {{is the first time that}} information concerning schools for pupils with SEBD in Scotland has been gathered together to provide an overall picture of the service on offer.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{narrative}} inquiry was to explore how parents understand and experience their child’s involvement and non-involvement in community leisure experiences. The study involved five parents with children between eight and twenty-one years of age, and asked them about the recreation experiences of their child who had a cognitive and/or physical disability. Narrative methodology enabled a holistic, comprehensive and personal approach to exploring their experiences. Each parent completed two narrative interviews, the first to produce a narrative account and the second to explore the meaning {{of his or her}} narrative. This study used a two step analysis process to explore the narratives. The descriptive analysis focused on establishing the context, and creating the narrative account using the interview transcripts and my interpretation of the stories. An interpretive analysis was completed in three phases to explore the purpose of the story, the order and sequence and presentation of self, and explored the cultural practices of the narratives. From the narratives I found many parents told their stories for other parents or recreation practitioners. The key message from the stories was the importance of recreation for social networking for both parent and child. Important spaces from the stories were identified: space to be social, space to succeed and space to be engaged or included. Other characters played critical roles in the recreation experiences. Internal conflict was often experienced by parents where the desire for the child to participate clashed with the parents’ hesitation, concern, or schedule. The final phase of analysis revealed a difference between my understandings of key terms (segregation, integration and inclusion) and the parents’ understandings of those terms. Many parents and children had experienced a <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>exclusion</b> both from and within recreation experiences. Inclusion was found to be an enabling and disabling practice. I found gains in political power developed through increases in social and psychological power. Levels of trust and the phases of empowerment were important to the parents’ understandings of inclusion. The conclusions identified the parents as being responsible for negotiating recreation, and the children had an awareness of their disability. Finally, discrepancies about the meaning of segregation, integration and inclusion were identified...|$|E
40|$|For {{physically}} challenged students, inequalities {{in further}} education begin with inequalities {{that have shaped}} the whole schooling system in South Africa. The limited provision that exists for physically challenged students at {{further education and training}} colleges in KwaZulu-Natal Province, especially black physically challenged students, means that for these students there is a very high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>exclusion</b> from the education system. Many students with physical challenges still need an ally even in their basic accommodation. The focus of this research was on exploring challenges experienced by physically challenged students at “Mango” (pseudonym) Further Education and Training College in KwaZulu-Natal Province. That investigation was conducted in terms of the availability of resources for physically challenged students at Further Education and Training Colleges, the use of learner support services, accessibility of buildings for these students and the roles played by parents of physically challenged students at Further Education and Training Colleges in KwaZulu-Natal Province. This study was therefore designed to explore not only the challenges experienced by physically challenged students at Mango FET College in KwaZulu-Natal Province, but also their experiences and responses to such challenges. This research study was conducted with students who were physically challenged and their lecturers from Mango FET College in KwaZulu-Natal Province. The sample of the population included six participants who were physically challenged students and four participants who were lecturers teaching physically challenged students at Mango FET College. Furthermore, participants comprised both females and males who were doing different levels at the college, i. e. NQF level two, NQF level three and NQF level four students. The research study sought to explore the challenges experienced by such physically challenged students at Mango FET College in KwaZulu-Natal Province in order for the college to meet these students’ academic needs. Observations and semi-structured interviews were the main data-collection tools used in the study. Results from the current research study indicated that inaccessibility of buildings, lack of resources for physically challenged students, inadequate support from student support services and the college represented major barriers {{to the success of the}} physically challenged students at Mango FET College in KwaZulu-Natal Province. Moreover, although student support services are available, the entire college population, students and staff alike, should all be responsible for creating an inclusive environment where students with physical challenges can experience a sense of community and attitudes of embracing diversity and accommodating differences. The responsibility thus lies with all relevant role players of Mango FET College in KwaZulu-Natal Province who must work together to overcome social and academic barriers; to accommodate physically challenged students properly, provide them with accessible buildings, encourage parents to assist physically challenged students, endeavour to meet their academic, social and emotional needs and assist them to develop academically. In future, progress can be made through the increased coordination of student support services, building accessible buildings with ramps for physically challenged students, and providing adequate resources for these students.
