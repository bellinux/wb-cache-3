5|$|Prior to the war, Prinz Eugen was {{assigned}} to the 1st Battleship Division of Austro-Hungarian Navy.

As a result, she hardly ever left Pola.|$|E

5|$|Regular {{service in}} the bus tunnel began on September 15, 1990, on five routes serving the University District, North Seattle, and Renton. The <b>limited</b> <b>service</b> {{was the result of}} delays in the {{manufacturing}} of dual-mode buses from Breda, which were fully delivered in 1991. The opening was preceded by soft openings of each individual station, beginning with Westlake station in August 1989, and ending with Convention Place station the day before the beginning of service.

5|$|The {{ship had}} a very <b>limited</b> <b>service</b> life. At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, she was the flagship of the 1st Battle Squadron, based in Taranto. But due to the policy of restraint adopted by the Italian Navy, Dante Alighieri and the other battleships of the Italian fleet saw no action. Financial limitations in the post-war period forced the navy to scrap the ship to reduce the naval budget. The ship was accordingly stricken on 1 July 1928 and sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} poorly {{constructed}} {{and as a}} result had a very <b>limited</b> <b>service</b> career. She was heavily modified after her delivery to Prussia in 1865 and briefly served with the fleet between 1866 and 1871. During the Franco-Prussian War in 1870–1871, the ship was assigned as a guard ship in Hamburg. After the war, it was discovered that the internal wood construction was badly rotted; she was therefore removed from service in October 1871. Prinz Adalbert was stricken from the naval register in May 1878 and broken up for scrap that year.|$|E

5|$|Bayern was {{commissioned}} {{midway through the}} war, and had a <b>limited</b> <b>service</b> career. The first operation in which the ship took part was an abortive fleet advance into the North Sea on 18–19 August 1916, a month after she had been commissioned. The ship also participated in Operation Albion in the Gulf of Riga, but shortly after the German attack began on 12 October 1917, Bayern was mined {{and had to be}} withdrawn for repairs. She was interned with the majority of the High Seas Fleet in Scapa Flow in November 1918 following the end of World War I. On 21 June 1919, Admiral Ludwig von Reuter ordered the fleet to be scuttled; Bayern sank at 14:30. In September 1934, the ship was raised, towed to Rosyth, and scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Commissioned only a {{few years}} before the {{outbreak}} of World War I, the ships had <b>limited</b> <b>service</b> careers. All three of the battleships conducted training cruises in the Mediterranean Sea in 1912. In 1913, they took part in an international naval demonstration in the Ionian Sea that protested the Balkan Wars. After Italy declared war on Austro-Hungary and the other Central Powers in 1915, the three Radetzky-class ships bombarded coastal targets in the Adriatic Sea. After 1915, their participation in the war became minimal. All three ships were handed over to Italy {{after the end of the}} war, and broken up for scrap between 1920 and 1926.|$|E
