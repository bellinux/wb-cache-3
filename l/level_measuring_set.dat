Thus the variance of [...] is lower if there is positive correlation within each pair. Such correlation is very common in the repeated <b>measures</b> <b>setting,</b> since many factors influencing the value being compared are unaffected by the treatment.

40|$|AbstractIn February 2014, the New Zealand Ministry of Health {{released}} a new framework {{for measuring the}} performance of the New Zealand health system. The two key aims are to strengthen accountability to taxpayers and to lift {{the performance of the}} system's component parts using a ‘whole-of-system’ approach to performance measurement. Development of this new framework – called the Integrated Performance and Incentive Framework (IPIF) – was stimulated by a need for a performance management framework which reflects the health system as a whole, which encourages primary and secondary providers to work towards the same end, and which incorporates the needs and priorities of local communities. Measures within the IPIF will be set at two levels: the system <b>level,</b> where <b>measures</b> are <b>set</b> nationally, and the local district <b>level,</b> where <b>measures</b> which contribute towards the system level indicators will be selected by local health alliances. In the first year, the framework applies only at the system level and only to primary health care services. It will continue to be developed over time and will gradually be extended to cover a wide range of health and disability services. The success of the IPIF in improving health sector performance depends crucially on the willingness of health sector personnel to engage closely with the measurement process...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an exact}} reformulation {{of a broad}} class of neighborhood filters, among which the bilateral filters, in terms of two functional rearrangements: the decreasing and the relative rearrangements. Independently of the image spatial dimension (one-dimensional signal, image, volume of images, etc.), we reformulate these filters as integral operators defined in a one-dimensional space corresponding to the <b>level</b> <b>sets</b> <b>measures.</b> We prove the equivalence between the usual pixel-based version and the rearranged version of the filter. When restricted to the discrete setting, our reformulation of bilateral filters extends previous results for the so-called fast bilateral filtering. We, in addition, prove that {{the solution of the}} discrete setting, understood as constant-wise interpolators, converges to the solution of the continuous setting. Finally, we numerically illustrate computational aspects concerning quality approximation and execution time provided by the rearranged formulation.

In this paper we study the reformulation {{of a broad}} class of nonlocal filters in terms of two functional rearrangements: the decreasing and the relative rearrangements. Independently of the dimension of the image, we reformulate these filters as integral operators defined in a one-dimensional space corresponding to the <b>level</b> <b>sets</b> <b>measures.</b> We prove the equivalency between the original and the rearranged versions of the filters and propose a discretization in terms of constant-wise interpolators, which we prove to be convergent to {{the solution of the}} continuous setting. For some particular cases, this new formulation allows us to perform a detailed analysis of the filtering properties. Among others, we prove that the filtered image is a contrast change of the original image, and that the filtering procedure behaves asymptotically as a shock filter combined with a border diffusive term, responsible for the staircaising effect and the loss of contrast...|$|R
40|$|Following Davies, Elekes and Keleti, {{we study}} <b>measured</b> <b>sets,</b> i. e. Borel sets B in R (or in a Polish group) {{for which there}} is a {{translation}} invariant Borel measure assigning positive and σ-finite measure to B. We investigate which sets can be written as a (disjoint) union of <b>measured</b> <b>sets.</b> We show that every Borel nullset B⊂R of the second category is larger than any nullset A⊂R in the sense that there are partitions B=B_ 1 ∪ B_ 2, A=A_ 1 ∪ A_ 2 and gauge functions g_ 1, g_ 2 such that the Hausdorff measures satisfy H^g_i(B_i) = 1 and H^g_i(A_i) = 0 (i= 1, 2). This implies that every Borel set of the second category is a union of two <b>measured</b> <b>sets.</b> We also present Borel and compact sets in R which are not a union of countably many <b>measured</b> <b>sets.</b> This is done in two steps. First we show that non-locally compact Polish groups are not a union of countably many <b>measured</b> <b>sets.</b> Then, to certain Banach spaces we associate a Borel and/or σ-compact additive subgroup of R which is not a union of countably many <b>measured</b> <b>sets.</b> It is also shown that there are <b>measured</b> <b>sets</b> which are null or non-σ-finite for every Hausdorff measure of arbitrary gauge function...|$|R

50|$|The null cover {{characterization}} {{conveys the}} intuition that a random real number {{should not have}} any property that is “uncommon”. Each <b>measure</b> 0 <b>set</b> {{can be thought of}} as an uncommon property. It is not possible for a sequence to lie in no <b>measure</b> 0 <b>sets,</b> because each one-point <b>set</b> has <b>measure</b> 0. Martin-Löf's idea was to limit the definition to <b>measure</b> 0 <b>sets</b> that are effectively describable; the definition of an effective null cover determines a countable collection of effectively describable <b>measure</b> 0 <b>sets</b> and defines a sequence to be random if it does not lie in any of these particular <b>measure</b> 0 <b>sets.</b> Since the union of a countable collection of <b>measure</b> 0 <b>sets</b> has <b>measure</b> 0, this definition immediately leads to the theorem that there is a <b>measure</b> 1 <b>set</b> of random sequences. Note that if we identify the Cantor space of binary sequences with the interval 0,1 of real numbers, the measure on Cantor space agrees with Lebesgue measure.|$|R
