25|$|Giger {{conceived}} the Alien as being vaguely human but a human in full armor, protected from all outside forces. He mandated that the creature have no eyes, {{because he felt}} that it made them much more frightening if you could not tell they were <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>you.</b> Giger also gave the Alien's mouth a second inner set of pharyngeal jaws located {{at the tip of}} a long, tongue-like proboscis which could extend rapidly for use as a weapon. His design for the creature was heavily influenced by an aesthetic he had created and termed biomechanical, a fusion of the organic and the mechanic. His mock-up of the Alien was created using parts from an old Rolls Royce car, rib bones and the vertebrae from a snake, molded with plasticine. The Alien's animatronic head, which contained 900 moving parts, was designed and constructed by special effects designer Carlo Rambaldi. Giger and Rambaldi together would win the 1980 Academy Award for Visual Effects for their design of the Alien.|$|E

Hilson still manages {{to look beyond}} gorge. But then again, this chick could look cutting-edge in a giant pickle barrel." [...] The review also compared Timbaland's look a cross between Run D.M.C. and The Matrix.|$|E

500|$|Blabbermouths Don Kaye {{gave the}} opinion that [...] "a handful of songs" [...] on Christ Illusion [...] "are either too generic or the {{arrangements}} are too clumsy to work well", and specifically singled out the track: [...] "I'm <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>you,</b> 'Jihad' and 'Skeleton Christ'." [...] Ben Ratliff of New York Times remarked that the song is [...] "predictably tough stuff, but let's {{put it on a}} scale. It is tougher, and less reasoned, than Martin Amis's recent short story 'The Last Days of Muhammad Atta.' It is no tougher than a taped message from Al Qaeda." [...] Peter Atkinson of KNAC.com was equally unimpressed, describing the group's choice of song climax as: ...|$|E
500|$|Because of its November 1942 release, the New York Film Critics {{decided to}} include the film in its 1942 award season for best picture. Casablanca lost to In Which We Serve. However, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences stated that since the film went into {{national}} release {{in the beginning of}} 1943, it would be included in that year's nominations. Casablanca was nominated for eight Academy Awards, and won three. As Bogart stepped out of his car at the Academy Awards ceremony, [...] "the crowd surged forward, almost engulfing him and his wife, Mayo Methot. It took 12 police officers to rescue the two, and a red-faced, startled, yet smiling Bogart heard a chorus of cries of 'good luck' and 'here's <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>you,</b> kid' as he was rushed into the theater." ...|$|E
500|$|The script {{has been}} subject to a {{significant}} amount of misquotation. One of the lines most closely associated with the film—"Play it again, Sam"—is inaccurate. When Ilsa first enters the Café Americain, she spots Sam and asks him to [...] "Play it once, Sam, for old times' sake." [...] After he feigns ignorance, she responds, [...] "Play it, Sam. Play 'As Time Goes By'." [...] Later that night, alone with Sam, Rick says, [...] "You played it for her, you can play it for me," [...] and [...] "If she can stand it, I can! Play it!" [...] Rick's toast to Ilsa, [...] "Here's <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>you,</b> kid", used four times, was not written into the draft screenplays, but has been attributed to a comment Bogart said to Bergman as he taught her poker between takes. It was voted the fifth most memorable line in cinema in AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes by the American Film Institute.|$|E

2500|$|... 2HB {{is a song}} {{written by}} Bryan Ferry and first {{recorded}} by Roxy Music for their 1972 debut album, Roxy Music. Ferry also recorded a version for his 1976 solo album, Let's Stick Together. The title is a pun, not about the European nomenclature of pencil leads, but a dedication to Bogart ("2HB" [...] = [...] "to Humphrey Bogart"). In particular, the song references Casablanca, including the line [...] "Here's <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> kid, hard to forget".|$|E

But in our playoff in the 1988 U.S. Open, I was in a good frame of mind to handle him. We didn't say three words all day, which was fine with me.

2500|$|Utilisation: Any {{utilisation}} {{leads to}} increasing trance depth. All utilisation should proceed as {{a continuation of}} extension of the initial procedure. Much can be done nonverbally; for example, if any subjects are just looking blankly at me, I may slowly shift my gaze downward, causing them {{to look at their}} hand, which I touch and say [...] "look at this spot.". This intensifies the trance state. Then, whether the subjects are <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> or at their hand or just staring blankly, you can use your left hand to touch their elevated right hand from above or the side - so long as you merely give the suggestion of downward movement. Occasionally a downward nudge or push is required. If a strong push or nudge is required, check for anaesthesia.|$|E
