50|$|First, {{we define}} for each node its {{preferred}} child, which informally is the most-recently touched child by a traditional {{binary search tree}} lookup. More formally, consider a subtree T, rooted at p, with children <b>l</b> (<b>left)</b> and r (right). We set r as the preferred child of p if the most recently accessed node in T is in the subtree rooted at r, and l as the preferred child otherwise. Note that if the most recently accessed node of T is p itself, then l is the preferred child by definition.|$|E

The first digit L indicates a particular number system {{to be used by}} the following digits. The last digit R is an error detecting check digit, that allows some errors to be detected in scanning or manual entry. The guard patterns separate the two groups of six numerical digits and establish the timing.|$|E

50|$|The regimental headquarters, band, and First Battalion {{arrived in}} San Francisco on 16 July 1900. They {{immediately}} boarded the Transport Sumner and sailed for Nagasaki, Japan on 17 July. Later in July, Companies I, K, and <b>L</b> <b>left</b> their stations for San Francisco {{and went into}} camp at the Presidio. M Company also came from Fort McPherson at the same time. The First Battalion arrived at Nagasaki on 10 August. There they transferred to the Transport Indiana, and sailed for Tientsin via Taku on 13 August. The battalion arrived off of the Taku forts (already captured by the allies) on 16 August. During {{the latter part of}} the month, the Battalion reconnoitered and skirmished continuously over the same terrain where the 9th Infantry had lost 100 men killed in action (including their regimental commander, Colonel Liscum). Despite the fact that the Boxers had been dispersed several months before, numerous small bands of them were still operating in the country.|$|E

In an interview with Marilyn McMahon, staff writer, published in the Santa Barbara News-Press on March 8, 2011, Bragg claimed she graduated from that institution with a [...] "bachelor's degree in biochemistry". In the same interview, Bragg stated that her mother died at age 45 in an automobile accident. This confuses the reader because an obituary {{has been found that}} says something different. Nettie Pendleton's Oakland Tribune obituary of July 30, 1964 reads ("Mrs. Pendleton, whose death followed a brief illness, is survived by a daughter, Patricia Pendleton Bragg, of Hollywood; and two sons, Harry C. Pendleton, Jr., of Oakland, and Herbert Coward Deacon...." [...] by a prior marriage).
