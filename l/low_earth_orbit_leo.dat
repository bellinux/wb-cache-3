5|$|The Skylon is a fully {{reusable}} {{single stage}} to orbit (SSTO) vehicle, {{able to achieve}} orbit without staging, which {{is intended to be}} used principally as a reusable launch system. Proponents of the SSTO approach have often claimed that staging involves a number of inherent complications and problems due to complexity, such as being difficult or typically impossible to recover and reuse most elements, thus unavoidably incurring great expense to produce entirely new launch vehicles instead; therefore, they believe that SSTO designs hold the promise of providing a reduction to the high cost of space flights. Operationally, it is envisioned for the non-crewed Skylon to take off from a specially strengthened runway, gain altitude in a fashion akin to a conventional aeroplane and perform an ascent at very high speeds, in excess of five times the speed of sound (3,800 miles per hour), to attain a peak altitude of roughly 92,000 feet, on the edge of <b>low</b> <b>earth</b> <b>orbit</b> (<b>LEO),</b> where payloads would typically be launched prior to the vehicle's re-entry into the atmosphere, upon which it will conduct a relatively gentle descent before performing a traditional landing upon a runway.|$|E

2500|$|Radio {{occultation}} is {{a remote}} sensing technique where a GNSS signal tangentially scrapes the Earth, passing through the atmosphere, and is received by a <b>Low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>Orbit</b> (<b>LEO)</b> satellite.

An LEO satellite samples the total electron content and bending angle of many such signal paths as it watches the GNSS satellite rise or set behind the Earth. Using an Inverse Abel's transform, a radial profile of refractivity at that tangent point on earth can be reconstructed.|$|E

An ADS-B {{system with a}} strong focus on space-based ADS-B can provide global and continuous air traffic surveillance to enhance the operation of spacecraft and spaceplanes in the NAS and above.

The services can be integrated in the Air Traffic Management (ATM) information exchange concept of the System Wide Information System (SWIM).
