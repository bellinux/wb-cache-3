500|$|Metacritic {{gave the}} season a Metascore—a {{weighted}} average {{based on the}} impressions of a select fifteen critical reviews—of 81, signifying [...] "universal acclaim". James Poniewozik of Time labeled the series {{as one of the}} six best dramas on television. He praised Bell as [...] "a captivating star," [...] and said that the series [...] "uses its pulp premise to dramatize a universal teen experience: that growing up means sleuthing out the mystery of who you really are." [...] Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times called Veronica Mars an update to the [...] "classic California film noir". She felt that Veronica Mars was the best new series on UPN, and that the title character was potentially [...] "this season's most interesting character creation". McFadden described the series as [...] "Alias in its attitude, Raymond Chandler in its writing and The O.C. in its class-consciousness." [...] James South of Paste praised the [...] "crisp, clever writing", and noted the supporting characters were more than just plot devices. He commended Bell's portrayal of Veronica as [...] "simultaneously smart, vulnerable, tough and injured", and found the guest stars were well-utilized. South wrote the remaining cast was [...] "uniformly good", but gave Dohring a special mention for his acting. Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com praised the first-season finale for being [...] "just the sort of satisfying capper you <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> series that, week after week, keeps you asking questions".|$|E
500|$|Although not a ratings success, {{the series}} was a {{critical}} success from its first season. Robert Abele of LA Weekly said [...] "in this smart, engaging series about a former popular girl turned crime-solving high school outcast, the hard-boiled dialogue comes from its teen protagonist's mouth {{in a way that}} stabs any potential cutesiness in the heart with an ice pick." [...] In her review, Paige Wiser of the Chicago Sun Times said that [...] "on Veronica Mars, wholesome is out; gritty reality is in. The show never soft-pedals the timeless, fundamental truth that high school is hell." [...] Joyce Millman of The Phoenix felt that {{the series was}} [...] "a character study masquerading as a high-school drama". Joy Press of The Village Voice saw the series as [...] "a sharp teen noir in the making. Tinged with class resentment and nostalgia for Veronica's lost innocence, this series pulses with promise." [...] Michael Abernethy of PopMatters said that [...] "intrigue, drama, and humor, Veronica Mars is also a lesson book for the disenfranchised. Few TV series aim so high; even fewer succeed so well." [...] James Poniewozik of Time labeled it as one of the six best dramas on television.

Sir Thomas was a man to magnify rather than lesson these evils. And now he allowed his friend,--a man for whose behalf he had bound himself to use all the exercise of friendship,--to go from him with an idea that nothing but suicide could prevent this marriage, simply because there was an amount of debt, which, when compared with the man's prospects, should hardly have been regarded as a burden!

I believe I have mentioned that seven mansions, besides this, formed part of Mr. Luxmore's property: I have found them seven white elephants. The greed of tenants, the dishonesty of solicitors, and the incapacity that sits upon the bench, have combined together to make these houses the burthen of my life. I had no sooner, indeed, begun to look into these matters for myself, than I discovered so many injustices and met with so much studied incivility, that I was plunged into a long series of lawsuits, some of which are pending to this day. You must have heard my name already; I am the Mrs. Luxmore of the Law Reports: a strange destiny, indeed, for one born with an almost cowardly desire for peace! But I am of the stamp of those who, when they have once begun a task, will rather die than leave their duty unfulfilled. I have met with every obstacle: insolence and ingratitude from my own lawyers; in my adversaries, that fault of obstinacy which is to me perhaps the most distasteful in the calendar; from the bench, civility indeed--always, I must allow, civility--but never a spark of independence, never that knowledge of the law and love of justice which {{we have a right to}} <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> judge, the most august of human officers.

Indeed, there sprung up quite a flirtation between Miss La Creevy and Tim Linkinwater, who said a {{thousand}} jocose and facetious things, and became, by degrees, quite gallant, not to say tender. Little Miss La Creevy, on her part, was in high spirits, and rallied Tim on having remained a bachelor all his life with so much success, that Tim was actually induced to declare, that if he could get anybody to have him, he didn't know but what he might change his condition even yet. Miss La Creevy earnestly recommended a lady she knew, who would exactly suit Mr Linkinwater, and had a very comfortable property of her own; but this latter qualification had very little effect upon Tim, who manfully protested that fortune would be no object with him, but that true worth and cheerfulness of disposition were what a man should <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wife, and that if he had these, he could find money enough for the moderate wants of both. This avowal was considered so honourable to Tim, that neither Mrs Nickleby nor Miss La Creevy could sufficiently extol it; and stimulated by their praises, Tim launched out into several other declarations also manifesting the disinterestedness of his heart, and a great devotion to the fair sex: which were received with no less approbation. This was done and said with a comical mixture of jest and earnest, and, leading to a great amount of laughter, made them very merry indeed.|$|E
60|$|In complexion, {{color of}} the hair, and outline of face, Margery Waring bore a strong family {{resemblance}} to her brother. In spite of exposure, and {{the reflection of the}} sun's rays from the water of the lake, however, HER skin was of a clear, transparent white, such as one might <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> drawing-room, but hardly expect to find in a wilderness; while the tint of her lips, cheeks, and, in a diminished degree, of her chin and ears, were such as one who wielded a pencil might long endeavor to catch without succeeding. Her features had the chiselled outline which was so remarkable in her brother; while in HER countenance, in addition to the softened expression of her sex and years, there was nothing to denote any physical or moral infirmity, to form a drawback to its witchery and regularity. Her eyes were blue, and her hair as near golden as human tresses well could be. Exercise, a life of change, and of dwelling much in the open air, had given to this unusually charming girl not only health, but its appearance. Still, she was in no respect coarse, or had anything in the least about her that indicated her being accustomed to toil, with some slight exception in her hands, perhaps, which were those of a girl who did not spare herself, when there was an opportunity to be of use. In this particular, the vagrant life of her brother had possibly been of some advantage to her, as it had prevented her being much employed in the ordinary toil of her condition in life. Still, Margery Waring had that happy admixture of delicacy and physical energy, which is, perhaps, oftener to be met in the American girl of her class, than in the girl of almost any other nation; and far oftener than in the young American of her sex, who is placed above the necessity of labor.|$|E
