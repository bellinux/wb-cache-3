5|$|Depending on {{the type}} of tumor, paraneoplastic phenomena—symptoms not due to the local {{presence}} of cancer—may initially attract attention to the disease. In lung cancer, these phenomena may include hypercalcemia, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH, abnormally concentrated urine and diluted blood), ectopic ACTH production, or Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (muscle weakness due to autoantibodies). Tumors {{in the top of the}} lung, known as Pancoast tumors, may invade the <b>local</b> <b>part</b> of the sympathetic nervous system, leading to Horner's syndrome (dropping of the eyelid and a small pupil on that side), as well as damage to the brachial plexus.|$|E

25|$|A {{lenticular}} {{galaxy is}} a type of galaxy intermediate between an elliptical and a spiral galaxy in galaxy morphological classification schemes. Lenticular galaxies are disc galaxies (like spiral galaxies) that have used up or lost most of their interstellar matter and therefore have very little ongoing star formation. They may, however, retain significant dust in their disks. As a result, they consist mainly of aging stars (like elliptical galaxies). Because of their ill-defined spiral arms, if they are inclined face-on {{it is often difficult to}} distinguish between them and elliptical galaxies. Despite the morphological differences, lenticular and elliptical galaxies share common properties like spectral features and scaling relations. Both can be considered early-type galaxies that are passively evolving, at least in the <b>local</b> <b>part</b> of the Universe.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{formulate}} a conjecture for the <b>local</b> <b>parts</b> of Weyl group multiple Dirichlet series attached to root systems of type D. Our conjecture {{is analogous to}} the description of the <b>local</b> <b>parts</b> of type A series given by Brubaker, Bump, Friedberg, and Hoffstein [3] in terms of Gelfand–Tsetlin patterns. Our conjecture is given in terms of patterns for irreducible representations of even orthogonal Lie algebras developed by Littelmann [13]. 1...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in visual tracking {{have focused on}} han-dling deformations and occlusions using the part-based ap-pearance model. However, it remains a challenge {{to come up with}} a reliable target representation using <b>local</b> <b>parts,</b> and hence existing trackers continue to face drifting prob-lems. To deal with this challenge, we propose a robust online model, formulating the tracking task as a problem of identifying Temporally Coherent Part (TCP) clusters. Specifically, we pose the TCP clusters identification task as a dense neighborhoods searching problem using a re-lational hypergraph in which the relationship among mul-tiple temporal <b>local</b> <b>parts</b> is encoded as the affinity value of a hyperedge connecting them. Such high-order relation-ships among multiple <b>local</b> <b>parts</b> across the temporal do-main make our tracker more robust towards deformations and occlusions. Extensive experiments on various chal-lenging video sequences demonstrate that our TCP-based method performs better than the state-of-the-art methods. 1...|$|R

50|$|During this period, SAIC {{effectively}} {{built an}} entire modern automotive component supply chain in Shanghai from scratch, {{and the number}} and quality of locally produced auto parts rose significantly. Cars that were previously assembled in China from knock-down kits provisioned by Volkswagen became products built from parts produced in Shanghai, and between 1990 and 1996 the city more than doubled its contribution to the national output of automotive components. In 1987, the only <b>local</b> <b>parts</b> used in one car, the Volkswagen Santana, were tires, radio, and antenna, but by 1998 over 90% of the components used in its manufacture were locally sourced.

40|$|We {{introduce}} an algorithm for a non-negative 3 D tensor factorization for {{the purpose}} of establishing a <b>local</b> <b>parts</b> feature decomposition from an object class of images. In the past such a decomposition was obtained using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) where images were vectorized before being factored by NMF. A tensor factorization (NTF) on the other hand preserves the 2 D representations of images and provides a unique factorization (unlike NMF which is not unique). The resulting ”factors” from the NTF factorization are both sparse (like with NMF) but also separable allowing efficient convolution with the test image. Results show a superior decomposition to what an NMF can provide on all fronts — degree of sparsity, lack of ghost residue due to invariant parts and efficiency of coding of around an order of magnitude better. Experiments on using the <b>local</b> <b>parts</b> decomposition for face detection using SVM and Adaboost classifiers demonstrate that the recovered features are discriminatory and highly effective for classification. 1...|$|R
