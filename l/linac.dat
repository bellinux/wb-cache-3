5|$|This process, {{developed}} by Stony Brook Physics, yields francium isotopes with masses of 209, 210, and 211, {{which are then}} isolated by the magneto-optical trap (MOT). The production rate of a particular isotope depends on {{the energy of the}} oxygen beam. An 18O beam from the Stony Brook <b>LINAC</b> creates 210Fr in the gold target with the nuclear reaction 197Au + 18O → 210Fr + 5n. The production required some time to develop and understand. It was critical to operate the gold target very close to its melting point {{and to make sure that}} its surface was very clean. The nuclear reaction embeds the francium atoms deep in the gold target, and they must be removed efficiently. The atoms quickly diffuse to the surface of the gold target and are released as ions, but this does not happen every time. The francium ions are guided by electrostatic lenses until they land in a surface of hot yttrium and become neutral again. The francium is then injected into a glass bulb. A magnetic field and laser beams cool and confine the atoms. Although the atoms remain in the trap for only about 20 seconds before escaping (or decaying), a steady stream of fresh atoms replaces those lost, keeping the number of trapped atoms roughly constant for minutes or longer. Initially, about 1000 francium atoms were trapped in the experiment. This was gradually improved and the setup is capable of trapping over 300,000 neutral atoms of francium a time. These are neutral metallic atoms in a gaseous unconsolidated state. Enough francium is trapped that a video camera can capture the light given off by the atoms as they fluoresce. The atoms appear as a glowing sphere about 1 millimeter in diameter. This was the first time that anyone had ever seen francium. The researchers can now make extremely sensitive measurements of the light emitted and absorbed by the trapped atoms, providing the first experimental results on various transitions between atomic energy levels in francium. Initial measurements show very good agreement between experimental values and calculations based on quantum theory. Other synthesis methods include bombarding radium with neutrons, and bombarding thorium with protons, deuterons, or helium ions. Francium has not been synthesized in amounts large enough to weigh.|$|E
25|$|The {{injection}} system {{consists of a}} 250 MeV <b>LINAC,</b> a low energy transfer line, a 2.9 GeV booster synchrotron and a high energy transfer line. The <b>LINAC</b> was operated for over 30 years {{as part of the}} Saskatchewan Accelerator Lab and operates at 2586MHz. The 78m low energy transfer line takes the electrons from the below-ground <b>LINAC</b> to the ground level booster in the newer CLS building, via two vertical chicanes. The full energy 2.9 GeV booster, chosen to give high orbit stability in the storage ring, operates at 1Hz, with an RF frequency of 500Hz, unsynchronised with the <b>LINAC.</b> This results in significant beam loss at the extraction energy.|$|E

40|$|This paper reviews {{efforts on}} using high energy (25 - 30 MeV) and high power (10 - 20 kW) {{electron}} <b>linacs</b> and lower energy (7 MeV) proton <b>linacs</b> for medical radioisotope production.

25|$|With the NRU reactor at the Chalk River Laboratories due {{to close}} in 2016, {{there was a need}} to find {{alternative}} sources of the medical isotope technetium-99m, a mainstay of nuclear medicine. In 2011 the Canadian Light Source received $14 Million in funding to investigate the feasibility of using an electron <b>LINAC</b> to produce molybdenum-99, the parent isotope of technetium-99. As part of this project a 35MeV <b>LINAC</b> has been installed in an unused underground experimental hall previously used for photonuclear experiments with the SAL <b>LINAC.</b> First irradiations are planned for late summer 2012, with the results to be evaluated by the Winnipeg Health Sciences Centre.|$|E
25|$|In {{parallel}} to these developments, {{a similar approach}} was designed for a linear particle accelerator or <b>Linac.</b> Installation of the first 4MeV clinical linear accelerator began in June 1952 in the Medical Research Council (MRC) Radiotherapeutic Research Unit at the Hammersmith Hospital, London. The system was handed over for physics and other testing in February 1953 and began to treat patients on 7 September that year. Meanwhile, work by at the Stanford Microwave Laboratory {{led to the development}} of a 6-MV accelerator, which was installed at Stanford University Hospital, California, in 1956. <b>Linac</b> units quickly became favored devices for conventional fractionated radiotherapy but it lasted until the 1980s before dedicated <b>Linac</b> radiosurgery became a reality. In 1982, the Spanish neurosurgeon J. Barcia-Salorio began to evaluate the role of cobalt-generated and then Linac-based photon radiosurgery for the treatment of AVMs and epilepsy. In 1984, Betti and Derechinsky described a Linac-based radiosurgical system. Winston and Lutz further advanced Linac-based radiosurgical prototype technologies by incorporating an improved stereotactic positioning device and a method to measure the accuracy of various components. Using a modified <b>Linac,</b> the first patient in the United States was treated in Boston Brigham and Women's Hospital in February 1986.|$|E
25|$|The {{next stage}} of {{acceleration}} is linear particle accelerator (<b>linac).</b> This stage consists of two segments. The first segment has 5 vacuum vessel for drift tubes, operating at 201MHz. The second stage has 7 side-coupled cavities, operating at 805MHz. At the end of <b>linac,</b> the particles are accelerated to 400MeV, or about 70% {{of the speed of}} light. Immediately before entering the next accelerator, the H− ions pass through a carbon foil, becoming H+ ions (protons).|$|E

25|$|The {{acceleration}} {{occurs in}} a number of stages. The first stage is the 750 keV Cockcroft-Walton pre-accelerator, which ionizes hydrogen gas and accelerates the negative ions created using a positive voltage. The ions then pass into the 150 meter long linear accelerator (<b>linac)</b> which uses oscillating electrical fields to accelerate the ions to 400 MeV.

25|$|The {{nuclear physics}} 14UD {{is one of}} a handful of large Van de Graaff accelerators in the world. It was the largest machine of its type when {{installed}} in 1974. After many upgrades the 14UD is capable of running terminal voltage of up 16.7 MV. Charging is via three inductive charging chains. In 1996 a superconducting RF <b>linac</b> was installed that is used as an energy booster for the 14UD enabling higher energies to be reached.|$|E
25|$|Medical grade linacs {{accelerate}} electrons using a tuned-cavity waveguide, {{in which}} the RF power creates a standing wave. Some linacs have short, vertically mounted waveguides, while higher energy machines {{tend to have a}} horizontal, longer waveguide and a bending magnet to turn the beam vertically towards the patient. Medical linacs use monoenergetic electron beams between 4 and 25MeV, giving an X-ray output with a spectrum of energies up to and including the electron energy when the electrons are directed at a high-density (such as tungsten) target. The electrons or X-rays can be used to treat both benign and malignant disease. The <b>LINAC</b> produces a reliable, flexible and accurate radiation beam. The versatility of <b>LINAC</b> is a potential advantage over cobalt therapy as a treatment tool. In addition, the device can simply be powered off when not in use; there is no source requiring heavy shielding – although the treatment room itself requires considerable shielding of the walls, doors, ceiling etc. to prevent escape of scattered radiation. Prolonged use of high powered (>18MeV) machines can induce a significant amount of radiation within the metal parts of the head of the machine after power to the machine has been removed (i.e. they become an active source and the necessary precautions must be observed).|$|E
25|$|Radiation therapy can be {{delivered}} by external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy (internal radiotherapy), or by intra-operative radiotherapy (IORT). In the case of external beam radiotherapy, X-rays are delivered from outside the body by a machine called a Linear Accelerator or <b>Linac.</b> In contrast, brachytherapy involves the precise placement of radiation source(s) directly at the treatment site. IORT includes a one-time dose of radiation administered with breast surgery. Radiation therapy {{is important in the}} use of breast-conserving therapy because it reduces the risk of local recurrence.|$|E

25|$|While it is {{possible}} to do some types of research using an irradiator much like that used for gamma sterilization, it is common in some areas of science to use a time resolved experiment where a material is subjected to a pulse of radiation (normally electrons from a <b>LINAC).</b> After the pulse of radiation, the concentration of different substances within the material are measured by emission spectroscopy or Absorption spectroscopy, hence the rates of reactions can be determined. This allows the relative abilities of substances to react with the reactive species generated by the action of radiation on the solvent (commonly water) to be measured. This experiment is known as pulse radiolysis which is closely related to Flash photolysis.|$|E
25|$|The {{overall goals}} of PIP are to {{increase}} the repetition rate of the Booster beam from 7Hz to 15Hz and replace old hardware to increase reliability of the operation. Before {{the start of the}} PIP project, a replacement of the pre-accelerator injector was underway. The replacement of almost 40-year-old Cockcroft–Walton generators to RFQ started in 2009 and completed in 2012. At the <b>linac</b> stage, the analog beam position monitor (BPM) modules were replaced with digital boards in 2013. A replacement of <b>Linac</b> vacuum pumps and related hardware is expected to be completed in 2015. A study on the replacement of 201-MHz drift tubes is still ongoing. At the boosting stage, a major component of the PIP is to upgrade the Booster ring to 15-Hz operation. The Booster has 19 radio frequency stations. Originally, the Booster stations were operating without solid-state drive system which was acceptable for 7-Hz, but not for 15-Hz operation. A demonstration project in 2004 converted one of the stations to solid state drive prior to the PIP project. As part of the project, the remaining stations were successfully converted to solid state in 2013. Another major part of the PIP project is to refurbish and replace 40-year-old Booster cavities. Many cavities have been refurbished and tested to operate at 15Hz repetition rate. The completion of cavity refurbishment is expected to be completed in 2015 and the repetition rate can be gradually increased to 15-Hz operation from that point. A longer term upgrade task is to replace the Booster cavities with a new design. The research and development of the new cavities is underway. The completion of the Booster cavity replacement is expected to be in 2018.|$|E

25|$|The {{cyclotron}} was {{an improvement}} over the linear accelerators (linacs) that were available when it was invented, being more cost- and space-effective due to the iterated interaction of the particles with the accelerating field. In the 1920s, {{it was not possible}} to generate the high power, high-frequency radio waves which are used in modern linacs (generated by klystrons). As such, impractically long <b>linac</b> structures were required for higher-energy particles. The compactness of the cyclotron reduces other costs as well, such as foundations, radiation shielding, and the enclosing building. Cyclotrons have a single electrical driver, which saves both money and power. Furthermore, cyclotrons are able to produce a continuous stream of particles at the target, so the average power passed from a particle beam into a target is relatively high.|$|E

The ions are then further accelerated by the PS and SPS before being injected into LHC ring, where they reached an energy of 2.3 TeV per nucleon (or 522 TeV per ion), higher than the energies reached by the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider.
