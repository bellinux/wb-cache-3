5|$|To fly {{non-stop}} {{across the}} Atlantic Ocean, Concorde required the greatest supersonic range of any aircraft. This {{was achieved by}} a combination of engines which were highly efficient at supersonic speeds, a slender fuselage with high fineness ratio, and a complex wing shape for a high <b>lift-to-drag</b> <b>ratio.</b> This also required carrying only a modest payload and a high fuel capacity, and the aircraft was trimmed with precision to avoid unnecessary drag.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} design {{completed by}} McDonnell Aircraft in 1965 is usually {{considered part of}} Project Isinglass, however some documents refer to the aircraft as having been codenamed Project Rheinberry. McDonnell's proposed boost-glide aircraft, submitted to the CIA independently of the Convair Isinglass proposals, featured a small, manned, rocket-powered craft with a high <b>lift-to-drag</b> <b>ratio</b> that would be air-launched by a B-52 bomber while flying over the Atlantic Ocean. The aircraft would ignite its rocket engine and adopt a trajectory that would take it over the Soviet Union at speeds of Mach 20 and {{at an altitude of}} over , before descending over the Pacific Ocean to a landing at Groom Lake, Nevada, as a glider, landing on the lake bed using a skid landing gear.|$|E

40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{data that}} were derived in 1967 {{from the analysis}} of flight-generated data for the Gemini entry module are presented. These data represent the aerodynamic characteristics exhibited by the vehicle during the entry portion of Gemini 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 11, and 12 missions. For the Gemini, 5, 8, 10, 11, and 12 missions, the flight-generated <b>lift-to-drag</b> <b>ratios</b> and corresponding angles of attack are compared with the wind tunnel data. These comparisons show that the flight generated <b>lift-to-drag</b> <b>ratios</b> are consistently lower than were anticipated from the tunnel data. Numerous data uncertainties are cited that provide an insight into the problems {{that are related to}} an analysis of flight data developed from instrumentation systems, the primary functions of which are other than the evaluation of flight aerodynamic performance...|$|R
50|$|In 1871, Wenham and Browning {{made the}} first wind tunnel. Members of the Society used the tunnel and learned that {{cambered}} wings generated considerably more lift than expected by Cayley's Newtonian reasoning, with <b>lift-to-drag</b> <b>ratios</b> of about 5:1 at 15 degrees. This clearly demonstrated the possibility of building practical heavier-than-air flying machines: what remained were the problems of controlling and powering the craft.|$|R
25|$|Efficiency: For maglev systems the <b>lift-to-drag</b> <b>ratio</b> can exceed that of {{aircraft}} (for example Inductrack can approach 200:1 at high speed, {{far higher than}} any aircraft). This can make maglev more efficient per kilometer. However, at high cruising speeds, aerodynamic drag is much larger than lift-induced drag. Jets take advantage of low air density at high altitudes to significantly reduce air drag. Hence despite their <b>lift-to-drag</b> <b>ratio</b> disadvantage, they can travel more efficiently at high speeds than maglev trains that operate at sea level.|$|E
25|$|A wing {{is a type}} of fin that {{produces}} lift, while moving through air or some other fluid. As such, wings have streamlined cross-sections that are subject to aerodynamic forces and act as an airfoils. A wing's aerodynamic efficiency is expressed as its <b>lift-to-drag</b> <b>ratio.</b> The lift a wing generates at a given speed and angle of attack can be one to two orders of magnitude greater than the total drag on the wing. A high <b>lift-to-drag</b> <b>ratio</b> requires a significantly smaller thrust to propel the wings through the air at sufficient lift.|$|E
25|$|In {{cruising}} flight, the thrust-to-weight {{ratio of}} an aircraft is the inverse of the <b>lift-to-drag</b> <b>ratio</b> because thrust is the inverse of drag, and weight is the inverse of lift.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lift-to-drag</b> <b>ratios</b> for {{practical}} aircraft vary from about 4:1 for vehicles and birds with relatively short wings, up to 60:1 {{or more for}} vehicles with very long wings, such as gliders. A greater angle of attack relative to the forward movement also increases the extent of deflection, and thus generates extra lift. However a greater angle of attack also generates extra drag.|$|R
50|$|Though many designs {{have been}} studied since, it is {{unlikely}} SST aircraft will be economically feasible in the near future. The inherent lower <b>lift-to-drag</b> <b>ratios</b> at supersonic speeds mean SSTs will have poorer fuel economy than subsonic designs. Even faster subsonic designs, like the Boeing Sonic Cruiser, have been met with little industry interest {{in an era of}} increasingly difficult economic pressures on the airlines.|$|R

The cabin is 2.4m (8ft) longer than the 900 and have a lower 6,000ft (1,800m) cabin altitude. the 6,100lb-thrust (21.7kN) PW307A was finally selected, among other risk-sharing partners: Honeywell for avionics architecture, auxiliary power unit, air management system; with Parker Hannifin for the power generation system and wheels brakes; and TRW Aeronautical Systems for the hydromechanical flap and airbrake systems.|$|E
500|$|Lilienthal {{had made}} [...] "whirling arm" [...] tests on {{only a few}} wing shapes, and the Wrights mistakenly assumed the data would apply to their wings, which had a {{different}} shape. The Wrights took a huge step forward and made basic wind tunnel tests on 200 wings of many shapes and airfoil curves, followed by detailed tests on 38 of them. The tests, according to biographer Fred Howard, [...] "were the most crucial and fruitful aeronautical experiments ever conducted in so short a time with so few materials and at so little expense". An important discovery was the benefit of longer narrower wings: in aeronautical terms, wings with a larger aspect ratio (wingspan divided by chord—the wing's front-to-back dimension). Such shapes offered much better <b>lift-to-drag</b> <b>ratio</b> than the broader wings the brothers had tried so far.|$|E

500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{thorough}} redesign {{was of the}} wing, the objective being to match {{the performance of the}} cancelled AV-16 while retaining the Pegasus engine of the AV-8A. Engineers designed a new, one-piece supercritical wing, which improves cruise performance by delaying the rise in drag and increasing <b>lift-to-drag</b> <b>ratio.</b> Made of composites, the wing is thicker and has a longer span than that of the AV-8A. Compared to the AV-8A's wing, it has a higher aspect ratio, reduced sweep (from 40° to 37°), and an area increased from [...] to [...] The wing has a high-lift configuration, employing flaps that deploy automatically when maneuvering, and drooped ailerons. Using the leading edge root extensions, the new wing allows for a 6,700lb (3,035kg) increase in payload compared with the first-generation Harriers after a 1,000ft (300m) takeoff roll. Because the wing is almost exclusively composite, it is [...] lighter than the AV-8A's smaller wing.|$|E
2500|$|Gliders were {{developed}} from the 1920s for recreational purposes.

This gave rise to the popular sport known as gliding although the term {{can also be used to}} refer to merely descending flight. Such gliders designed for soaring are sometimes called sailplanes.|$|E
2500|$|The airframe, largely made of fiberglass, carbon fiber, and Kevlar, weighed 939 pounds (426kg) when empty.

However, when it was fully loaded before the {{historic}} flight, it weighed 9,694.5 pounds (4,397kg) due to {{the large amount of}} fuel required for the long-distance flight. The aircraft had an estimated <b>lift-to-drag</b> <b>ratio</b> (L/D) of 27. [...] The canard and wing airfoils were custom-designed, and the aircraft was analyzed using computational fluid dynamics.

50|$|Through the 1950s {{various studies}} on {{supersonic}} transports (SSTs) {{suggested that the}} economics of such designs were far too poor to be practical.

This works well at supersonic speeds, but offers very little lift at low speed. In order to make a design that is able to take off and land on existing runways, either the aircraft would have to use wider wings and lose supersonic cruise economy, have enormous engine power, or be extremely large.|$|R
