40|$|The innate {{immune system}} {{responds}} to inflammation, infection and injury by recruiting neutrophils and other leukocytes. These cells are able to leave the intravascular compartment in a process called leukocyte recruitment. This process involves several distinct steps: selectin-mediated rolling, firm adhesion via integrins, postarrest modifications including <b>adhesion</b> strengthening and <b>leukocyte</b> crawling and finally transmigration into tissue. Genetic defects affecting the different steps of the cascade can result in severe impairment in leukocyte recruitment. So far, three <b>leukocyte</b> <b>adhesion</b> <b>deficiencies</b> (LAD I-III) have been described in humans. These LADs are rare autosomal recessive inherited disorders and, although clinically distinct, exhibit several common features including recurrent bacterial infections and leukocytosis. In LAD-I, mutations within the beta 2 -integrin gene result in a severe defect in beta 2 integrin-mediated firm <b>leukocyte</b> <b>adhesion.</b> Defects in the posttranslational fucosylation of selectin ligands dramatically reduce leukocyte rolling and lead to LAD-II. Finally, LAD-III, also known as LAD-I variant, is caused by impaired integrin activation due to mutations within the kindlin- 3 gene.

In the present study, the functions of Kindlin- 3 in this process were investigated in effector T lymphocytes trafficking to various lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues. In vitro, Kindlin- 3 -deficient T cells displayed severely impaired lymphocyte function antigen- 1 -dependent lymphocyte adhesion but partially conserved very late antigen- 4 adhesiveness. In vivo, the number of adoptively transferred Kindlin- 3 -deficient T effectors was dramatically elevated in the circulating pool compared with normal effectors, and the Kindlin- 3 mutant effectors failed to enter inflamed skin lesions. The frequency of Kindlin- 3 -deficient T effectors arrested on vessel walls within inflamed skin-draining lymph nodes was also reduced. Strikingly, however, Kindlin- 3 -deficient effector T cells accumulated inside these vessels at significantly higher numbers than their wild-type lymphocyte counterparts and successfully extravasated into inflamed lymph nodes. Nevertheless, on entering these organs, the interstitial motility of these lymphocytes was impaired.

40|$|Abstract: Protein C is a plasma serine {{protease}} that when activated plays {{a central role}} in modulating the function of the vascular endothelium and its interface with the innate immune system. Activated protein C (APC) has a dual mechanism of action via the feedback inhibition of thrombin generation, and as an agonist of protease activated receptor- 1 (PAR- 1). Through different cofactor interactions, this dual mechanism of antithrombotic and cytoprotective activity results in the ability of APC to modulate endothelial dysfunction by blocking cytokine signaling, functional cell adhesion expression, vascular permeability, apoptosis, and modulating <b>leukocyte</b> migration and <b>adhesion.</b> <b>Deficiency</b> in protein C, which occurs during systemic inflammatory activation, is highly associated with organ dysfunction. APC has shown efficacy in a number of preclinical models of thrombosis and ischemia, and the recombinant human APC drotrecogin alfa (activated), reduces mortality in patients with high-risk severe sepsis. The ability of APC to suppress pro-inflammatory pathways and enhance cellular survival suggests that APC {{plays a key role in}} the adaptive response to protect the vessel wall from insult and to enhance endothelial, cellular, and organ survival. The focus of this review will be to summarize the emerging data suggesting the potential therapeutic benefit of APC and related members of the pathway in the prevention and treatment of acute kidney injury...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{receptor}} {{for advanced}} glycation endproducts, RAGE, {{is involved in}} the pathogenesis of many inflammatory conditions, which is mostly related to its strong activation of NF-κB but also due to its function as ligand for the β 2 -integrin Mac- 1. To further dissect the stimulus-dependent role of RAGE on leukocyte recruitment during inflammation, we investigated β 2 -integrin-dependent <b>leukocyte</b> <b>adhesion</b> in RAGE -/- and Icam 1 -/- mice in different cremaster muscle models of inflammation using intravital microscopy. Results We demonstrate that RAGE, but not ICAM- 1 substantially contributes to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) -induced <b>leukocyte</b> <b>adhesion</b> in TNF-α-pretreated cremaster muscle venules in a Mac- 1 -dependent manner. In contrast, fMLP-stimulated <b>leukocyte</b> <b>adhesion</b> in unstimulated cremaster muscle venules is independent of RAGE, but dependent on ICAM- 1 and its interaction with LFA- 1. Furthermore, chemokine CXCL 1 -stimulated <b>leukocyte</b> <b>adhesion</b> in surgically prepared cremaster muscle venules was independent of RAGE but strongly dependent on ICAM- 1 and LFA- 1 suggesting a differential and stimulus-dependent regulation of <b>leukocyte</b> <b>adhesion</b> during inflammation in vivo.

Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: saline, LPS, saline + indomethacin and LPS + indomethacin, with six rats in each group. Rats were pretreated with LPS (300 mu g/kg, by intravenous) or saline. After 6 h, indomethacin was administered (20 mg/kg, by gavage). Three hours after treatments, rats were killed. Macroscopic gastric damage, gastric NP-SH concentration, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and mesenteric <b>leukocyte</b> <b>adhesion</b> (intravital microscopy) were assessed. Statistical analysis was performed using {{one-way analysis of variance}} followed by the Newman-Keuls test. Statistical significance was set at P < 0. 05.

The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of LFA 703 in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) -induced leukocyte–endothelium interactions in the colon. For this purpose, the superior mesenteric artery was occluded for 30 min and leukocyte responses were analyzed in colonic venules after 120 min of reperfusion in mice using inverted intravital fluorescence microscopy. First, the inhibitory mechanisms of LFA 703 on <b>leukocyte</b> <b>adhesion</b> were investigated in vitro using a mouse CD 4 + 8 + thymocyte cell line. Immunoneutralization of LFA- 1 and ICAM- 1 abolished <b>leukocyte</b> <b>adhesion,</b> whereas inhibition of VLA- 4 had no effect in this in vitro assay. Indeed, it was found that LFA 703 dose-dependently reduced LFA- 1 -dependent <b>leukocyte</b> <b>adhesion</b> to mouse endothelial cells in vitro with an IC 50 of 3. 2 μM. I/R caused an increase in <b>leukocyte</b> rolling and <b>adhesion</b> in colonic venules. Immunoneutralization of LFA- 1 significantly reduced I/R-induced <b>leukocyte</b> <b>adhesion</b> by 89 % in colonic venules. In contrast, I/R-provoked leukocyte rolling was insensitive to inhibition of LFA- 1 function. Administration of 30 mg kg− 1 of LFA 703 decreased reperfusion-induced <b>leukocyte</b> <b>adhesion</b> by more than 91 %, while the level of leukocyte rolling was unchanged, suggesting that LFA 703 effectively blocked LFA- 1 -dependent firm <b>adhesion</b> of <b>leukocyte</b> in the colon.

This study demonstrates that LFA- 1 is indeed a critical adhesion molecule in mediating postischemic <b>leukocyte</b> <b>adhesion</b> in the colon. Moreover, this is the first study showing that a statin-based synthetic compound has the capacity to abolish LFA- 1 -dependent <b>leukocyte</b> <b>adhesion</b> in I/R.

The contribution of L-selectin and/or P-selectin to leukocyte rolling were also assessed in this model. Using intravital microscopy we observed that 60 min of ischemia followed by reperfusion caused a profound increase in <b>leukocyte</b> rolling and <b>adhesion.</b> A high dose of fucoidin (25 mg/kg) reduced leukocyte rolling by > 90 % and significantly reduced <b>leukocyte</b> <b>adhesion,</b> whereas a lower dose of fucoidin still reduced leukocyte rolling by 60 % but had no effect on <b>leukocyte</b> <b>adhesion.</b> Moreover, despite the profound reduction in leukocyte rolling with fucoidin, the remaining rolling cells were able to firmly adhere via a CD 18 -dependent mechanism, particularly in those postcapillary venules with reduced (30 - 50 %) shear rates. The increased rolling was also reduced 60 % by either an anti-P-selectin antibody, an anti-L-selectin antibody, or a combination of the two antibodies, but this reduction in rolling cells did not translate into significantly reduced <b>leukocyte</b> <b>adhesion.</b> Our data suggest that L-selectin, P-selectin, and a fucoidin-sensitive pathway contribute to the significant increase in reperfusion-induced leukocyte rolling.
