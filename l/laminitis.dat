5|$|Both {{dogs and}} horses are {{susceptible}} to the gastrointestinal side effects associated with salicylates, {{but it is a}} convenient treatment for arthritis in older dogs, and has shown some promise in cases of <b>laminitis</b> in horses. It is no longer commonly used for cases of <b>laminitis,</b> as it could be counterproductive for treatment. Aspirin should be used in animals only under the direct supervision of a veterinarian; in particular, cats lack the glucuronide conjugates that aid in the excretion of aspirin, making it potentially toxic. No clinical signs of toxicosis occurred when cats were given 25mg/kg of aspirin every 48 hours for 4 weeks.|$|E
5|$|A 2008 {{study found}} that Andalusians {{experience}} ischaemic (reduced blood flow) diseases of the small intestine at a rate significantly higher than other breeds; and stallions had higher numbers of inguinal hernias, with risk for occurrence 30 times greater than other breeds. At the same time, they also showed a lower incidence of large intestinal obstruction. In {{the course of the}} study, Andalusians also showed the highest risk of <b>laminitis</b> as a medical complication related to the intestinal issues.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Zayat Stables' horses Bodemeister {{and then}} Paynter ran second {{in each of}} the three legs of the Triple Crown. Bodemeister {{finished}} a narrow second place in both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes to I'll Have Another. Switching horses in the 2012 Belmont Stakes, Zayat's colt Paynter also finished second. Paynter went on to win the Grade I Haskell Invitational but shortly thereafter developed near-fatal complications from colitis and <b>laminitis.</b> Zayat authorized the highest quality of care for the horse, and following abdominal surgery and several months of rehabilitation, Paynter successfully returned to racing in 2013. After Zayat and his son Justin began making regular social media updates on Twitter with the hashtag #PowerUpPaynter, the horse developed a significant fan base, and received hundreds of get well cards, many from children. For his struggle to return to health, Paynter won NTRA Moment of the Year Award and Secretariat Vox Populi Award.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaves of}} red maple, {{especially}} when dead or wilted, are extremely toxic to horses. The toxin is unknown, but {{believed to be}} an oxidant because it damages red blood cells, causing acute oxidative hemolysis that inhibits the transport of oxygen. This not only decreases oxygen delivery to all tissues, but also leads {{to the production of}} methemoglobin, which can further damage the kidneys. The ingestion of 700grams (1.5 pounds) of leaves is considered toxic and 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) is lethal. Symptoms occur within one or two days after ingestion and can include depression, lethargy, increased rate and depth of breathing, increased heart rate, jaundice, dark brown urine, colic, <b>laminitis,</b> coma, and death. Treatment is limited and can include the use of methylene blue or mineral oil and activated carbon in order to stop further absorption of the toxin into the stomach, as well as blood transfusions, fluid support, diuretics, and anti-oxidants such as Vitamin C. About 50% to 75% of affected horses die or are euthanized as a result.|$|E
25|$|<b>Laminitis</b> is a {{major concern}} in horses {{suffering}} from endotoxemia. Ideally, prophylactic treatment should be provided to endotoxic horses, which includes the use of NSAIDs, DMSO, icing of the feet, and frog support. Horses are also sometimes administered heparin, which is thought {{to reduce the risk of}} <b>laminitis</b> by decreasing blood coagulability and thus blood clot formation in the capillaries of the foot.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the risk}} of endotoxemia, <b>laminitis</b> is a {{potential}} complication for horses suffering from colitis, and may become the primary cause for euthanasia. Horses are also at increased risk of thrombophlebitis.|$|E
25|$|On 1 May 2009 Sunline was {{put down}} after {{suffering}} from the debilitating hoof disease <b>laminitis</b> for nine months. A memorial has been established at Ellerslie Racecourse where she is buried.|$|E
25|$|In 1952 the {{previously}} healthy and strong Eri-Aaroni suffered from colic a few times, although with good treatment he recovered well. However, in August 1953 {{he came down}} with a particularly dramatic case, which was further complicated by <b>laminitis.</b> Eri-Aaroni died in September 1.|$|E
25|$|Oral steroids such as {{prednisolone}} {{are commonly}} used; however, side effects are common, {{and the horse}} may be predisposed to <b>laminitis.</b> Therefore, the use of aerosolised steroids via an equine inhaler are becoming more common. This route of administration reduces the dose required, {{and the risk of}} side effects. Originally, beclomethasone was used, but newer compounds are available now, such as fluticasone propionate.|$|E
25|$|Strictly speaking, colic refers only to signs {{originating}} from the gastrointestinal tract of the horse. Signs of colic {{may be caused}} by problems other than the GI-tract e.g. problems in the liver, ovaries, spleen, urogenital system, testicular torsion, pleuritis, and pleuropneumonia. Diseases which sometimes cause symptoms which appear similar to colic include uterine contractions, <b>laminitis,</b> and exertional rhabdomyolysis. Colic pain secondary to kidney disease is rare.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the world, working donkeys are {{associated}} with the very poor, with those living at or below subsistence level. Few receive adequate food, and in general donkeys throughout the Third World are under-nourished and over-worked. In temperate climates the forage available is often too abundant and too rich; over-feeding may cause weight gain and obesity, and lead to metabolic disorders such as founder (<b>laminitis)</b> and hyperlipaemia, or to gastric ulcers.|$|E
25|$|Turnout {{is thought}} to reduce the {{likelihood}} of colic, although this has not been proven. It is recommended that a horse receive ideally 18 hours of grazing time each day, as in the wild. However, many times this is difficult to manage with competition horses and those that are boarded, as well as for animals that are easy keepers with access to lush pasture and hence at risk of <b>laminitis.</b> Turnout on a dry lot with lower-quality fodder may have similar beneficial effects.|$|E
25|$|Volvulus of {{the large}} colon usually occurs where the {{mesentery}} attaches to the body wall, but may also occur at the diaphragmatic or sternal flexures, with rotations up to 720 degrees reported. It is most commonly seen in postpartum mares, usually presents with severe signs of colic that are refractory to analgesic administration, and horses often lie in dorsal recumbency. Abdominal distention is common due to strangulation and rapid engorgement of the intestine with gas, which then can lead to dyspnea as the growing bowel pushes against the diaphragm and prevents normal ventilation. Additionally, compression can place pressure on the caudal vena cava, leading to pooling of blood and hypovolemia. However, horses {{may not have a}} high heart rate, presumably due to increased vagal tone. Rectal palpation will demonstrate a severely gas distended colon, and the examiner {{may not be able to}} push beyond the brim of the pelvis due to the obstruction. The colon may be irreversibly damaged in as little as 3–4 hours from the initial time of the volvulus, so immediate surgical correction is required. The surgeon works to correct the volvulus and then removes any damaged colon. 95% of the colon may be resected, but often the volvulus damages more than this amount, requiring euthanasia. Plasma lactate levels can help predict survival rates, with an increased survival seen in horses with a lactate below 6.0mmol/L. Prognosis is usually poor, with a survival rate of approximately 36% of horses with a 360 degree volvulus, and 74% of those with a 270 degree volvulus, and a reoccurrence rate of 5–50%. Complications post-surgery include hypoproteinemia, endotoxic shock, <b>laminitis,</b> and DIC.|$|E
500|$|Horses {{are also}} {{susceptible}} to <b>laminitis,</b> {{a disease of}} the lamina of the hoof. [...] <b>Laminitis</b> has many causes, but the most common is related to a sugar and starch overload from a horse overeating certain types of food, particularly too much pasture grass high in fructan in early spring and late fall, or by consuming excessive quantities of grain.|$|E
500|$|Ponies and {{miniature}} {{horses are}} usually easy keepers and need less feed than full-sized horses. [...] This {{is not only}} because they are smaller, but also, because they evolved under harsher living conditions than horses, they use feed more efficiently. [...] Ponies easily become obese from overfeeding and are at high risk for colic and, especially, <b>laminitis.</b> Fresh grass is a particular danger to ponies; they can develop <b>laminitis</b> in as little as one hour of grazing on lush pasture.|$|E
500|$|After {{about three}} days, {{he seemed to}} be feeling better; his blood work became normal and his {{diarrhea}} cleared up, but he still had low-grade fevers. Against the odds, his hoof X-rays came back showing no separation of the laminae, and no rotation or sinking of the coffin bone in any of his feet. [...] Although the cryotherapy had not prevented <b>laminitis,</b> it might have kept it from becoming worse. On September 21, the casts were removed from his legs. [...] The <b>laminitis</b> treatment was successful and his feet were returning to normal, raising hopes that he could race again some day.|$|E
500|$|The {{medical staff}} were also worried, because a {{systemic}} illness with intestinal inflammation, such as colitis, {{is a common}} precursor to <b>laminitis,</b> a painful inflammation of the internal structures of the hoof. [...] The staff had been using cryotherapy on his lower legs as a precaution. Although his blood test results and protein levels began to stabilize, he nevertheless developed <b>laminitis</b> in three of his feet on September 4, ten days after {{he arrived at the}} center. The veterinarians treating Paynter put casts on his lower legs to support his feet. [...] Most experts believed that even if he survived his racing days were over, and the Zayat family feared that euthanasia would be necessary.|$|E
500|$|Colic, choke, and <b>laminitis</b> can be {{life-threatening}} when a {{horse is}} severely affected, and veterinary care {{is necessary to}} properly treat these conditions. [...] Other conditions, while not life-threatening, may have serious implications for the long-term health and soundness of a horse.|$|E
500|$|Recent studies {{address the}} level of various {{non-structural}} carbohydrates (NSC), such as fructan, in forages. [...] Too high an NSC level causes difficulties for animals prone to <b>laminitis</b> or equine polysaccharide storage myopathy (EPSM). [...] NSC cannot be determined by looking at forage, but hay and pasture grasses can be tested for NSC levels.|$|E
500|$|Soluble {{carbohydrates}} {{are found}} in nearly every feed source; corn has the highest amount, then barley and oats. Forages normally have only 6-8% soluble carbohydrate, but under certain conditions can have up to 30%. Sudden ingestion of large amounts of starch or high sugar feeds can cause at the least an indigestion colic, and at the worst potentially fatal colitis or <b>laminitis.</b>|$|E
500|$|Easy Jet was euthanized in 1992 due to <b>laminitis,</b> {{a disease}} of the hoof. He was buried in his paddock on Walter Merrick's 14 Ranch near Sayre, Oklahoma. Merrick was unable to bring himself to see the horse before he was put down. He said, [...] "I couldn't go, I just couldn't see him like that. He was too good a friend". Easy Jet was {{inducted}} into the AQHA Hall of Fame in 1993.|$|E
500|$|Paynter (foaled March 4, 2009) is an American-bred Thoroughbred racehorse {{notable for}} a {{promising}} three-year-old racing season {{that included a}} second-place finish in the Belmont Stakes and {{a victory in the}} Haskell Invitational, cut short by a near-fatal case of colitis requiring abdominal surgery, complicated by <b>laminitis.</b> Most experts believed that even if he survived, his racing days were over. His struggle for life, regularly updated via social media by his owners, gained him a large fan base and earned him the National Thoroughbred Racing Association Moment of the Year and Secretariat Vox Populi Award for 2012. His surgery was successful, and innovative treatment for <b>laminitis</b> prevented harm to his feet, so he was sent to the Fair Hill Training Center for recovery and rehabilitation. In his four-year-old year, he returned to the track in June 2013, almost eleven months after his 2012 Haskell victory, winning the first race of his comeback by [...] lengths, then running in three more graded stakes races, placing second in two of them, demonstrating his ability to compete against top horses. In November, 2013, he ran in the Breeders' Cup Classic and following the race was retired to WinStar Farm to stand at stud beginning with the 2014 breeding season.|$|E
500|$|On December 26, Paynter was {{selected}} as the winner of the 2012 Secretariat Vox Populi Award. [...] Penny Chenery, owner of Secretariat, for whom the award was named, said [...] "Paynter's popularity stems from his ability to battle and exceed expectations, making him the perfect choice as the recipient of this year's Vox Populi Award... After seeing firsthand the devastating effects of this disease, I am even more convinced that the industry must continue to diligently fight <b>laminitis.</b> The progress we have made to date clearly benefited Paynter—a beautiful colt with a tremendous spirit." ...|$|E
500|$|Leg {{injuries}} {{that are not}} immediately fatal still may be life-threatening because a horse's weight must be distributed evenly on all four legs to prevent circulatory problems, <b>laminitis,</b> and other infections. If a horse loses the use of one leg temporarily, there is the risk that other legs will break down during the recovery period because they are carrying an abnormal weight load. While horses periodically lie down for brief periods of time, a horse cannot remain lying in {{the equivalent of a}} human's [...] "bed rest" [...] because of the risk of developing sores, internal damage, and congestion.|$|E
500|$|Due to Secretariat's {{enduring}} popularity, Chenery {{remained a}} prominent figure in racing {{and a powerful}} advocate for Thoroughbred aftercare and veterinary research until her death in 2017. In 2004, the Maker's Mark Secretariat Center, dedicated to reschooling former racehorses and matching them to new homes, opened at the Kentucky Horse Park. In 2010, Chenery developed the Secretariat Vox Populi ("voice of the people") Award, which is voted for by racing fans. It is intended to acknowledge [...] "the horse whose popularity and racing excellence best resounded with the American public and gained recognition for Thoroughbred racing." [...] The consideration of the racing fan's engagement is what distinguishes the Vox Populi award from others. The first honoree in 2010 was Zenyatta, that year's Horse of the Year, while the second award went to Rapid Redux, a former claimer {{who went on to}} win 22 consecutive races at smaller racetracks. Paynter received the 2012 award for his battle with <b>laminitis,</b> the same condition that led to Secretariat's death. [...] "Paynter's popularity stems from his ability to battle and exceed expectations, making him the perfect choice as the recipient of this year's Vox Populi Award", said Chenery. [...] "After seeing firsthand the devastating effects of this disease, I am even more convinced that the industry must continue to diligently fight <b>laminitis.</b> The progress we have made to date clearly benefited Paynter — a beautiful colt with a tremendous spirit." ...|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of his three-year-old year, Secretariat was syndicated for a record-breaking $6.08 million on condition that he be retired from racing {{by the end of the}} year. Although he sired several successful racehorses, he ultimately was most influential through his daughters' offspring, becoming the leading broodmare sire in North America in 1992. Secretariat died in 1989 due to <b>laminitis.</b> [...] His daughters produced several notable sires, including Storm Cat, A.P. Indy, Gone West, Dehere and Chief's Crown, and through them Secretariat appears in the pedigree of many modern champions. He continues to be recognized as one of the greatest horses in American racing history.|$|E
500|$|Donkeys do {{best when}} allowed to consume {{small amounts of}} food over long periods, as is natural for them in an arid climate. They can meet their {{nutritional}} needs on 6 to 7 hours of grazing per day on average dryland pasture that is not stressed by drought. If they are worked long hours or {{do not have access}} to pasture, they require hay or a similar dried forage, with no more than a 1:4 ratio of legumes to grass. [...] They also require salt and mineral supplements, and access to clean, fresh water. [...] Like ponies and mules, in a lush climate, donkeys are prone to obesity and are at risk of <b>laminitis.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{level of}} {{treatment}} given to injured Thoroughbreds {{is often more}} intensive than for horses of lesser financial value [...] but also controversial, {{due in part to}} the significant challenges in treating broken bones and other major leg injuries. Leg injuries that are not immediately fatal still may be life-threatening because a horse's weight must be distributed evenly on all four legs to prevent circulatory problems, <b>laminitis,</b> and other infections. If a horse loses the use of one leg temporarily, there is the risk that other legs will break down during the recovery period because they are carrying an abnormal weight load. While horses periodically lie down for brief periods of time, a horse cannot remain lying in the equivalent of a human's [...] "bed rest" [...] because of the risk of developing sores, internal damage, and congestion.|$|E
500|$|All hay and {{concentrated}} feeds {{must be kept}} dry and free of mold, rodent feces, {{and other types of}} contamination that may cause illness in horses. Feed kept outside or otherwise exposed to moisture can develop mold quite quickly. [...] Due to fire hazards, hay is often stored under an open shed or under a tarp, rather than inside a horse barn itself, but should be kept under some kind of cover. [...] Concentrates take up less storage space, are less of a fire hazard, and are usually kept in a barn or enclosed shed. [...] A secure door or latched gate between the animals and any feed storage area is critical. [...] Horses accidentally getting into stored feed and eating too much at one time is a common but preventable way that horses develop colic or <b>laminitis.</b> [...] (see Illnesses related to improper feeding below) ...|$|E
500|$|On December 29, 2012, Paynter {{was shipped}} from Fair Hill back to California, where he resumed race {{training}} with Baffert. [...] When he left Fair Hill he weighed 1022 pounds and {{was described as}} [...] "full of himself." [...] Both Southwood and Javsicas believed that he could recover completely. [...] While numerous horses recovering from colitis and abdominal surgery {{have been able to}} return to their previous levels of competition, Paynter's successful recovery from <b>laminitis</b> was the biggest factor in his ability to resume racing. [...] He began jogging on the track on January 5, and had his first official workout on February 26. [...] On June 14 he was entered into a 7-furlong allowance race at Betfair Hollywood Park. [...] Ahmed Zayat said, [...] "He has shown so much courage, so much tenacity. I just want to let the horse do the talking." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 5) Symptomatic Control: Control of {{symptoms}} {{to some degree}} can be achieved with antihistamines (especially hydroxyzine, and with corticosteroids, although the potential side effects (e.g. <b>laminitis,</b> immune suppression) make this a less preferred option. In addition, antibiotics {{may be required to}} manage any secondary infection.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} {{disorders}} and injuries {{that can affect}} the equine hoof. <b>Laminitis</b> and navicular disease {{are two of the}} most serious. Thrush and white line disease, common bacterial infections, can become serious if left untreated. [...] Quiltor, an infection of the lower leg that can travel under the hoof, is also sometimes seen, although most commonly in draft horses.|$|E
2500|$|Nearly all pony breeds {{are very}} hardy, easy keepers that share {{the ability to}} thrive on a more limited diet {{than that of a}} regular-sized horse, {{requiring}} half the hay for their weight as a horse, and often not needing grain at all. However, for the same reason, they are also more vulnerable to <b>laminitis</b> and Cushing's syndrome. [...] They may also have problems with hyperlipemia.|$|E
2500|$|Horses {{that are}} fed {{improperly}} may develop colic or <b>laminitis,</b> particularly if fed spoiled feed, subjected to excessive feed, or an abrupt change of feed. Young horses who are improperly fed may develop growth disorders {{due to an}} imbalance of nutrients. Young horses may also develop osteochondrosis if they are overfed. [...] Regularly monitoring the horse's body condition score {{on a regular basis}} assists in helping the horse maintain proper weight.|$|E
2500|$|Sunday Silence died on August 19, 2002. He {{had been}} treated for <b>laminitis</b> for the {{previous}} 14 weeks and had developed an infection in one leg as well. [...] He {{had been given a}} stronger dose of a different painkilling medication the previous day to provide him relief, and apparently as a result, he had become comfortable enough to lie down {{for the first time in}} a week. [...] The following morning, he appeared unable to rise, and while veterinarians were discussing what to do, he died, apparently of heart failure.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} {{disorders}} that affect horses, including colic, <b>laminitis,</b> and internal parasites. [...] Horses also can develop various infectious diseases {{that can be}} prevented by routine vaccination. It is sensible to register a horse or pony with a local equine veterinarian, in case of emergency. The veterinary practice will keep {{a record of the}} owner's details and where the horse or pony is kept, and any medical details. [...] It is considered best practice for a horse to have an annual checkup, usually in the spring. [...] Some practitioners recommend biannual checkups, in the spring and fall.|$|E
