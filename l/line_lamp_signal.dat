40|$|Photoionization ion {{cyclotron}} resonance (pi-icr) spectroscopy is described in detail. The construction and use of rare gas resonance <b>line</b> <b>lamps</b> employing LiF windows is described, with principle emphasis on the argon resonance <b>line</b> <b>lamp</b> that produces photons of 11. 62 and 11. 83 eV. Calculations of the number density and single resonance signal intensity are made for primary, secondary, and tertiary ions, and the low pressure lineshape calculated for an unreactive primary ion. The ion chemistry of propanal, acetone, and propylene oxide (empirical formula C_ 3 H_ 6 O) is investigated using pi-icr with the argon resonance <b>line</b> <b>lamp.</b> The major reaction sequence in propanal and acetone is parent ion producing protonated parent ion, which condenses with the parent neutral to produce the proton bound dimer. This is also the reaction sequence in ethylene oxide. In propylene oxide, however, the parent ion relative abundance is esentially constant from 10 ^(- 6) to 10 ^(- 4) torr. The fragment ion of mass 43 is the predominant primary ion at the argon resonance lines, and reacts to form ions of mass 41, 57, and 59. Double resonance is {{used to determine the}} reaction sequence of the major ions. At 10 ^(- 4) torr, there is less than 2...|$|R

50|$|A major {{difficulty}} {{faced by}} an attacking force {{in a trench}} battle was unreliable communications. Wireless communications were still in their infancy, so the available methods were telephone, telegraph, semaphore, <b>signal</b> <b>lamps,</b> <b>signal</b> flares, homing pigeons and runners. Messages frequently could not get through, or if they did, were out of date. A delay would pass when transferring news to the division, corps and army headquarters.|$|R

40|$|There is {{some concern}} that turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> with clear outer lenses make it {{difficult}} in bright, sunny conditions {{to decide whether the}} signal is on or not. Two studies were performed. The first study was a survey of current practice in the U. S. with regard to the use of clear-lens turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps.</b> The main results are that clear outer lenses on rear turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> are used in about 28 % of all vehicle models, while the corresponding percentage for front turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> is about 70 %. The second study photometrically evaluated, under bright, sunny conditions, both luminance contrast and color contrast between the on and off states for turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> that use either an amber lens or a clear lens. The results indicate that luminance contrast between the on and off states is greater for lamps using an amber lens. On the other hand, the results indicate that color contrast between the on and off states is greater for lamps using a clear lens. Because luminance contrast {{is likely to be the}} primary variable influencing driver performance, these results suggest that using clear-lens turn <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> is likely to make it more difficult to determine, in bright, sunny conditions, whether the signal is on or not. However, the magnitude of the decrement in real-world performance with clear-lens <b>signal</b> <b>lamps</b> remains to be ascertained...|$|R
