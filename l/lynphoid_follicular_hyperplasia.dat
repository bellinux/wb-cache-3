The findings differ from previous studies, where nuclei of cells from follicle centres and interfollicular areas were measured and {{revealed no significant}} difference between follicular lymphoma and reactive <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia.</b> In the current study, by measuring only follicle centre cell nuclei, it has been found that, in reactive <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia,</b> the mean nuclear maximum diameter (Dmax) and area are significantly greater than in centroblastic-centrocytic follicular lymphoma. In addition, the standard deviation of these data is greater for reactive <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia</b> than <b>follicular</b> lymphoma, implying greater "scatter" or heterogeneity of the nuclear sizes in the follicle centre cells of the former than the latter.

The protein recognized by this mAB induces apoptosis in permeabilized lymphocytes in vitro. While this mAB reacted with approximately 46 % of paracortical CD 8 + cells in control nodes, it reacted with 75 % of such cells in HIV-induced <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia.</b> Germinal centers of the control nodes contained few TIA- 1 + cells; in <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia</b> caused by HIV- 1, almost all germinal center CD 8 + cells were TIA- 1 +.

40|$|ObjectiveWe {{sought to}} examine the {{distribution}} of parenchyma, follicles, and lymphocyte subsets in the thymus of patients with myasthenia gravis and to identify determinants of remission after thymectomy. MethodsSixty patients with myasthenia gravis who underwent thymectomy were examined. The thymus was divided into upper, middle, and lower parts. The upper part {{was defined as the}} superior horn, the lower part as the inferior horn, and the middle part as tissue located between the 2 horns. The percentage of parenchyma was measured morphometrically. The degree of <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia</b> was classified into 5 grades. The densities of CD 3 +, CD 4 +, and CD 8 + lymphocytes were classified into 5 grades. The remission of myasthenia gravis after thymectomy was examined with those variables in each part of the thymus. ResultsThe middle part had the highest percentage of parenchyma, the highest grade of <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia,</b> and the highest density of CD 3 +, CD 4 +, and CD 8 + lymphocytes among the 3 parts (P <. 001 -. 05). The grades of <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia</b> in the middle and lower parts were significantly higher in patients with improvement of myasthenia gravis than in those without (P <. 05). The densities of CD 3 +, CD 4 +, and CD 8 + lymphocytes in the cortex of the middle part were significantly higher in patients with improvement than in those without improvement (P <. 01 -. 05). ConclusionsThe thymus has a heterogeneous distribution of parenchyma, follicles, and lymphocyte subsets. The middle part had the largest parenchyma, the highest grade of <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia,</b> and the highest densities of CD 3 +, CD 4 +, and CD 8 + lymphocytes among the 3 parts of the thymus.

40|$|International audienceThe {{most common}} form of Myasthenia gravis (MG) is due to anti-acetylcholine {{receptor}} (AChR) antibodies and is frequently associated with thymic pathology. In this review, we discuss the immunopathological characteristics and molecular mechanisms of thymic <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia,</b> the effects of corticosteroids on this thymic pathology, and the role of thymic epithelial cells (TEC), a key player in the inflammatory thymic mechanisms. This review is based not only on the literature data but also on thymic transcriptome results and analyses of pathological and immunological correlations in a vast cohort of 1035 MG patients without thymoma. We show that among patients presenting a thymic hyperplasia with germinal centers (GC), 80 % are females, indicating that thymic <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia</b> is mainly a disease of women. The presence of anti-AChR antibodies is correlated with the degree of <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia,</b> suggesting that the thymus is a source of anti-AChR antibodies. The degree of hyperplasia is not dependent upon the time from the onset, implying that either the antigen is chronically expressed and/or that the mechanisms of the resolution of the GC are not efficiently controlled. Glucocorticoids, a conventional therapy in MG, induce a significant reduction in the GC number, together with changes in the expression of chemokines and angiogenesis. These changes are likely related to the acetylation molecular process, overrepresented in corticosteroid-treated patients, and essential for gene regulation. Altogether, based on the pathological and molecular thymic abnormalities found in MG patients, this review provides some explanations for the benefit of thymectomy in early-onset MG patients...|$|R

To determine whether the B-lymphocyte expansions characteristic of this syndrome represent polyclonal and virus-specific processes, the antigen specificity of B cells in lymphoid tissues of monkeys infected with simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) chimeras was assessed using an inverse immunohistochemical assay with biotinylated HIV- 1 envelope gp 120 (Env) as an antigen probe. Env-binding B cells were found aggregated in lymph node and splenic germinal centers (GCs). Most Env-binding GCs also contained an unstained population of B cells, suggesting the GCs were formed by a polyclonal (oligoclonal) process. By day 42 following infection, Env-binding B cells were present in 19 % of all lymph node GCs. Env-binding cells were present in 25 % of GCs even during chronic infection. This extraordinarily high frequency of Env-specific B lymphocytes suggests that the expansion of virus-specific B cells may largely account for the <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia</b> in AIDS virus-infected individuals.

Aim: The {{aim of this}} study was to review the current level of knowledge about diversion colitis. Methods: A literature search of relevant literature in the English language was carried out on PUBMED, MEDLINE and EMBASE. The following keywords were used: diversion colitis; disuse colitis; proctitis; colonic bacterial flora; stoma; de-functioned colon; faecal diversion; short chain fatty acids and lymphoid <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia.</b> Results: In total 35 articles met the inclusion criteria. 22 were case series, 9 were case reports, 2 were retrospective analysis and 2 were prospective randomized controlled studies. Diversion colitis is invariably present in all diverted segments of the colon. It is usually asymptomatic but can present with tenesmus, rectal discharge, bleeding per rectum and abdominal pain. Major macroscopic changes include mucosal nodularity, erythema and friability. Microscopic features are predominantly those of lymphoid <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia,</b> apthous ulceration and chronic inflammatory changes, mostly limited to sub mucosa. Treatment modalities include surveillance for asymptomatic patients, restoration of bowel continuity for severely symptomatic cases and the use of short chain fatty acid (SCFA) enemas in selected cases.

We examined {{the effect of a}} potent human CpG oligonucleotide (CpG ODN 2006) on different types of primary human malignant B cells and re-active <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia.</b> CpG oligodeoxynu-cleotide (CpG ODN), but not control (non-CpG ODN), increased the expression of costimulatory molecules (CD 40, CD 80, CD 86, CD 54) on malig-nant B cells without altering the phenotype of B cells obtained from reactive <b>follicular</b> <b>hyperplasia.</b> CpG ODN also enhanced expression of class I and class II MHC in most samples. CD 20 expression was increased in response to CpG ODN, most no-tably in B-CLL and marginal zone lymphoma. An inverse correlation was found between baseline ex-pression of CD 20 and CD 40 and their expression after exposure to CpG ODN, thus the most signif-icant increase in expression of these molecules was found in those samples that had the lowest baseline levels. In conclusion, CpG ODN can lead to in-creasing expression of molecules involved in co-stimulation, antigen presentation, and as targets for antibody-based therapy and deserve further evaluation as potential immunotherapeutic agents for B cell malignancy.
