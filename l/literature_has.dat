5|$|Delayed gratification, or {{deferred}} gratification, is {{the ability}} to resist the temptation for an immediate reward and wait for a later reward. Generally, delayed gratification is associated with resisting a smaller but more immediate reward in order to receive a larger or more enduring reward later. A growing body of <b>literature</b> <b>has</b> linked the ability to delay gratification to a host of other positive outcomes, including academic success, physical health, psychological health, and social competence.|$|E

5|$|A {{recorded}} Tamil <b>literature</b> <b>has</b> {{been documented}} for over 2000 years. The earliest period of Tamil literature, Sangam literature, is dated from ca. 300 BC – AD 300. It has the oldest extant literature among Dravidian languages. The earliest epigraphic records found on rock edicts and hero stones date {{from around the}} 3rd century BC. More than 55% of the epigraphical inscriptions (about 55,000) found by the Archaeological Survey of India are in the Tamil language. Tamil language inscriptions written in Brahmi script have been discovered in Sri Lanka, and on trade goods in Thailand and Egypt. The two earliest manuscripts from India, acknowledged and registered by the UNESCO Memory of the World register in 1997 and 2005, were written in Tamil.|$|E

5|$|Ancient Egyptian <b>literature</b> <b>has</b> been {{preserved}} {{on a wide}} variety of media.

Texts preserved and unearthed by modern archaeologists represent a small fraction of ancient Egyptian literary material. The area of the floodplain of the Nile is under-represented because the moist environment is unsuitable for the preservation of papyri and ink inscriptions. On the other hand, hidden caches of literature, buried for thousands of years, have been discovered in settlements on the dry desert margins of Egyptian civilization.|$|E

Diplomatic ties with Christendom were established in the Roman era under Ethiopia's first Christian king, Ezana of Axum, in the 4th century AD, and were renewed in the Late Middle Ages with embassies traveling to and from medieval Europe. Building on the legacy of ancient Greek and Roman historical writings about Ethiopia, medieval European chroniclers made attempts to describe Ethiopia, its people, and religious faith in connection to the mythical Prester John, who {{was viewed as a}} potential ally against Islamic powers. Ethiopian history and its peoples were also mentioned in works of medieval Islamic historiography and even Chinese encyclopedias, travel literature, and official histories.|$|E

The country with the most recipients of the Nobel Prize in Literature is France, with 16, followed by the United States and the United Kingdom with 11.|$|E
5|$|In {{the history}} of post-independence Latin America, dictatorships have been {{relatively}} commonexamples range from Paraguay's José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia in the 19th century to Chile's Augusto Pinochet in the 20th. In this context, Latin American <b>literature</b> <b>has</b> been distinguished by the protest novel, or dictator novel; the main story is based around the dictator figure, his behaviour, characteristics and {{the situation of the}} people under his regime. Writers such as Sarmiento used the power of the written word in order to criticize government, using literature as a tool, an instance of resistance and as a weapon against repression.|$|E

5|$|Tolkien's prose is unpretentious and straightforward, taking as {{given the}} {{existence}} of his imaginary world and describing its details in a matter-of-fact way, while often introducing the new and fantastic in an almost casual manner. This down-to-earth style, also found in later fantasy such as Richard Adams' Watership Down and Peter Beagle's The Last Unicorn, accepts readers into the fictional world, rather than cajoling or attempting to convince them of its reality. While The Hobbit is written in a simple, friendly language, each of its characters has a unique voice. The narrator, who occasionally interrupts the narrative flow with asides (a device common to both children's and Anglo-Saxon <b>literature),</b> <b>has</b> his own linguistic style separate {{from those of the}} main characters.|$|E
5|$|Other {{scholars}} such as Hazra and Rocher {{state that}} the Puranas are not a reliable source for dating Krishna or Indian history, because the content therein about kings, various peoples, sages, and kingdoms is highly inconsistent across the manuscripts. They state that these stories are probably {{based in part on}} real events, in part on hagiography, and in part embellished by expansive imagination. A high degree of inconsistency and manuscript corruption occurred particularly from the 12thcentury onwards, evidenced by cross referencing the texts; Matsya Purana, for example, stated that Kurma Purana has 18,000 verses, while Agni Purana asserts the same text has 8,000 verses, and Naradiya attests that the Kurma manuscript has 17,000 verses. The Puranic <b>literature</b> <b>has</b> gone through slow redaction and text corruption over time, as well as sudden deletion of numerous chapters and its replacement with new content to an extent that the currently circulating Puranas are completely different from those that existed before the 11thcentury, or 16thcentury. For example, a newly discovered palm-leaf manuscript in Nepal has been dated to be from 810CE, but is quite different from versions of the same Purana text that have been circulating in South Asia since the colonial era.|$|E
