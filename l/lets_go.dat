Disguising himself as a worker, he finds his way to Dr. No's control centre, which contains a nuclear pool reactor. As the American rocket lifts off, Bond overloads the reactor and knocks Dr. No into the reactor pool, killing him. Bond finds and frees Ryder, and the two escape the island in a boat as the entire lair explodes. After the boat runs out of fuel, they are rescued by Leiter, who arrives on a Royal Navy ship.

The Doctor wishes Amy a Merry Christmas before letting go of the button, and the spaceship explodes.|$|E

5|$|Scully is {{approached}} by the Dark Figure, who is {{revealed to be}} a Seraph, an angel who descended from the heavens and fathered four children with a mortal woman. God sent the Seraph to return the girls to Heaven {{in order to keep}} the Devil from claiming them as his own. Scully and Starkey find the fourth girl, Roberta Dyer (Perkins) at Gregory's church. However, Scully sees Starkey's horned shadow, revealing his true origins. Scully tries to help Roberta escape, but the women are confronted by the Seraph. She reluctantly <b>lets</b> <b>go</b> of Roberta's hand, after seeing Emily in place of Roberta, and lets her enter Heaven. Later, Scully tells Mulder they should have been protecting the girls from Starkey, not Gregory. She also believes that they are now in a place where they were meant to be.|$|E

25|$|Cellos are {{constructed}} and repaired using hide glue, which is strong but reversible, allowing for disassembly when needed.

Cellists repairing cracks in their cello do not use regular wood glue, because it cannot be steamed open when a repair has to be made by a luthier.|$|E

25|$|Abseiling can be dangerous, and {{presents}} risks, especially to unsupervised or inexperienced abseilers. According to German mountaineer Pit Schubert, about 25% of climbing deaths occur during abseiling, most commonly due to failing anchors. Another frequent cause of accidents is abseiling beyond {{the end of}} the rope. Backing up the rope set-up with a friction knot (autoblock, Kleimheist, or prusik) such that the slipping of the rope is stopped even if the climber <b>lets</b> <b>go</b> of the control rope provides a measure of safety with regard to the control of the rate of descent.|$|E
25|$|Forgiveness is the {{intentional}} and voluntary {{process by which}} a victim undergoes a change in feelings and attitude regarding an offense, <b>lets</b> <b>go</b> of negative emotions such as vengefulness, with an increased ability to wish the offender well. Forgiveness is different from condoning (failing to see the action as wrong {{and in need of}} forgiveness), excusing (not holding the offender as responsible for the action), forgetting (removing awareness of the offense from consciousness), pardoning (granted for an acknowledged offense by a representative of society, such as a judge), and reconciliation (restoration of a relationship).|$|E
25|$|It is {{not easy}} finding a mate in this zone. Some species depend on bioluminescence. Others are hermaphrodites, which doubles their chances of {{producing}} both eggs and sperm when an encounter occurs. The female anglerfish releases pheromones to attract tiny males. When a male finds her, he bites on to her and never <b>lets</b> <b>go.</b> When a male of the anglerfish species Haplophryne mollis bites into {{the skin of a}} female, he release an enzyme that digests the skin of his mouth and her body, fusing the pair {{to the point where the}} two circulatory systems join up. The male then atrophies into nothing more than a pair of gonads. This extreme sexual dimorphism ensures that, when the female is ready to spawn, she has a mate immediately available.|$|E

25|$|When attacked, slugs can {{contract}} their body, making themselves {{harder and}} more compact and more still and round. By doing this, they become firmly {{attached to the}} substrate. This, combined with the slippery mucus they produce, makes slugs more difficult for predators to grasp. The unpleasant taste of the mucus is also a deterrent. Some species present different response behaviors when attacked, such as the Kerry slug. In contrast to the general behavioral pattern, the Kerry slug retracts its head, <b>lets</b> <b>go</b> of the substrate, rolls up completely, and stays contracted in a ball-like shape. This is a unique feature among all the Arionidae, and among most other slugs. Some slugs can self-amputate (autotomy) {{a portion of their}} tail to help the slug escape from a predator. Some slug species hibernate underground during the winter in temperate climates, but in other species, the adults die in the autumn.|$|E
25|$|The {{three are}} found by Mamana gangster who tricks and then trains street {{children}} into becoming beggars. When Salim discovers Maman is blinding {{the children in}} order to make them more effective beggars, he flees with Jamal and Latika to a departing train. Latika fails to board the train as Salim purposefully <b>lets</b> <b>go</b> of her hand, in revenge for an extremely embarrassing prank that Latika had played on Salim. This resulted in her being recaptured by Maman. Over the next few years, Salim and Jamal make a living travelling on top of trains, selling goods, picking pockets, working as dish washers, and pretending to be tour guides at the Taj Mahal, where they also steal people's shoes. At Jamal's insistence, they return to Mumbai to find Latika, discovering that she is being raised by Maman to be a prostitute, to fetch him soon a high price and as a virgin. The brothers rescue her, and while escaping Maman they shoot him to death. Salim then manages to get a job with JavedMaman's rival crime lord. Back at their room, Salim orders Jamal to leave him and Latika alone. When Jamal refuses, Salim draws a gun on him, whereas Latika persuades Jamal to obey his brother and go away.|$|E
25|$|Emma, Hook {{and their}} guest return to see Rumplestiltskin {{in the hopes}} that he can open the time portal, but instead he tells them that only they can re-open it because only the people who came through the portal can re-open it, but they need to wield magic. Rumple gives Emma a wand and tells her to open the portal if she has magic, but she doesn't think she can. Rumple decides he’d rather forget {{everything}} he’s learned so as not to alter his future, then he sends Emma and Hook to a dark vault where he keeps dangerous and unpredictable magic, where their Storybrooke outfits are restored. Hook says that Emma still has some magic in her and after seeing what happened to her parents and realizing everything Henry did to bring her to Storybrooke, she's ready to return home. Hook and Emma then notice the wand lights up with magic and open up the portal, allowing Hook and the woman to escape first. Before she can leave, Rumple holds on to Emma and demands to know what happened to Baelfire/Neal. Emma tells him what happened, then she begs him not to take away the fact he died a hero. Rumplestiltskin drinks the forgetting potion and <b>lets</b> <b>go</b> of Emma where she is pulled into the portal, which sends her, Hook, and the woman back to Storybrooke.|$|E

Unaware of his true identity, she decides to help him on his quest to find {{somebody}} which eventually leads them to the world tree. After understanding the depth of Kazuto's love for Asuna, she resolves {{to give up on}} him and instead becomes attached to Kirito in ALO. However, when Kirito's true identity is revealed, she is heartbroken {{and the two of them}} have an awkward exchange in the real world where Sugu reveals her feelings for him. Not knowing how to respond or comfort her, Kazuto tells her he will be waiting for her in game. When they meet up they engage in a fight which culminates with both of them letting down their guard expecting the other one to kill them, however that only leads to them hugging and apologizing to each other.

500|$|Rhimes {{entitled}} the episode [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] {{because she felt}} [...] "that {{is what happens to}} each intern in this episode.

Izzie is forced to let go of her idealism. And that leads to her letting go of medicine. Alex <b>lets</b> <b>go</b> of his rage against Izzie. And Meredith... well, Meredith just lets go." [...] The costumes were designed by Mimi Melgaard; Rhimes noted that everyone was dressed in dark funeral colors to the prom, except Stevens who was dressed in pink. Stevens' dress was an Amsale creation. Monologues done by the five main characters were used in this episode. Rhimes commented: [...] "this was something we'd never done and I wasn't sure would work. But you place those pages {{into the hands of the}} actors and each and every one of them layered their characters' souls right into the dialogue." [...] The episode's theme was the prom; Rhimes said she wanted to do it since the beginning of the season.|$|E
