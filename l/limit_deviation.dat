40|$|AbstractDimensional {{accuracy}} {{characterized by}} <b>limit</b> <b>deviation</b> in diameter {{is of great}} importance for the sized steel used for critical machine parts and tool production. Sized steel is manufactured by cold drawing with small single reductions. One {{of the ways to}} improve the dimensional accuracy is {{to take into account the}} recovery effect. As a result of the effect above the sized steel diameter after drawing is a bit larger than the die bearing diameter in the non-loaded condition. For some predetermined combinations of the drawing process factors the recovery value is quite comparable with the diameter tolerance limit determined by standards. It is especially characteristic for sized steel more than 10 mm in diameter with yield strength of more than 400 MPa. The study describes the investigation results of the drawing process factors influence the value of sized steel recovery. Using the finite elements method the authors carried out simulation of stress and strain state in the deformation zone during drawing. It was proved that there was a relationship between the radial stresses developed on the sized steel surface on the exit from the die bearing zone and the recovery value. The research group determined the dependence of recovery value on the degree of reduction, the coefficient of contact friction, the die semi-angle and the die bearing length, the bar yield strength and its diameter. The obtained results make it possible to determine the parameters of sized steel drawing with the preset diameter <b>limit</b> <b>deviation</b> taking into account the recovery effect within a wide deviation range of processing factors...|$|E

So {{it is very important}} to keep a <b>limited</b> <b>deviation</b> between sensor data (the data sensed by sensor node) and sink data (the data delivered to applications). We put forward a data reliability notion to depict this <b>limited</b> <b>deviation</b> in this paper. Noticing that sensor data vary slightly in relative short time unless certain events occur, we construct a small subset of sensor data as key data, and provide reliable transport only for these key data instead of for all sensor data. This solution decreases retransmission and energy while keeping data reliability. Based on the data reliability notion, we propose DREET, a data-reliable energy-efficient transport layer protocol. Simulation results show that DREET provides an optimal event detection rate and relative standard deviation (RSD) between sensor data and sink data, by introducing a tiny increase to energy consumption (no more than 1. 97 % in our simulation).
