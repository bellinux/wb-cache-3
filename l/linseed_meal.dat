Using paired feeding trials it was shown that no one of these four vitamins is effective alone. Whether or not a simpler combination is effective is undetermined.

However, at 28 days of age, only 16. 5 to 63. 0 per cent of the young were weaned, and average weaning weights were subnormal. Addition of choline to the basal increased the weaning percentage somewhat, but some unrecognized factor, present in liver, soluble in water and alcohol, and adsorbed on fuller's earth at pH 1, was effective in increasing the weaning percentage to normal.

40|$|In the Sandhills area of Nebraska, {{which is}} principally a cattle {{producing}} section, {{there is little}} land suitable for tillage. Native grass is the chief source of income from the land. In the hills it is utilized for summer and winter grazing and in the valleys, for hay. The production of grass {{from year to year}} is relatively dependable. Even during the severe drought of the thirties, there was enough grass and hay to carry almost the usual number of cattle. Grass of the Sandhills area, however, is low in protein and phosphorus. This is a serious shortcoming, especially when the grass is used as hay or winter range. Calves wintered on native grass or hay do not consume enough to meet their protein and phosphorus requirements. As a consequence their development is retarded. This was not important when calves were held on the ranch until they were three or four years old before being sold. Now, with many cattle being marketed off grass as yearlings, the winter ration for weanling calves becomes important because of its effect not only upon winter gains but upon total gains up to the time the calf is sold at an age of approximately 18 months. It is recognized that in general the more gain a calf makes during the winter, the less it will make the 2 ̆ 7 following summer on grass. Where cattle are to be marketed off grass as yearlings, the rancher 2 ̆ 7 s problem is to winter the calf so a maximum profit may be obtained for the combined winter and summer period. In order to get good resu lts he will need answers to questions such as: How much gain can be obtained from feeding prairie hay that contains 5 to 7 per cent protein?

Concentrates were isonitrogenous and isocaloric. Animals (initial weight = 30025. 5 kg) were fed barley straw and concentrate ad libitum until slaughter weight (44312. 5 kg). Animal body weight was recorded every two weeks and feed consumption weekly. To study rumen fermentation parameters, a rumenocentesis was performed monthly. At slaughterhouse, samples from the rumen wall mucosa of the ventral floor of the cranial sac were collected. After separating rumen papillae individually, a digital vision technique was used to estimate papillae numbers per cm 2, average papillae surface area (mm 2) and mucosa surface area (mm 2 /cm 2). Daily concentrate and straw intakes were greater in animals fed canola seed than in animals fed linseed. In contrast, lipid source did not affect rumen parameters and papillae characteristics. Daily concentrate intake was lower in animals fed low NFC (6. 93 kg DM/d) than in those fed medium NFC (7. 21 kg DM/d) and high NFC (7. 15 kg DM/d). Rumen molar concentrations (m M) of Volatile Fatty Acid (VFA) decreased significantly in animals fed the low NFC diet and consequently, rumen pH tended to be greater in these animals (6. 53) compared with those the fed medium NFC (6. 24) or the high NFC (6. 28) levels. Animals fed the medium and the high NFC levels had greater propionate and n -butyrate rumen molar concentrations and tended to have a greater average papillae surface area and mucosa surface area than those fed the low NFC level. Regression equations showed a quadratic relationship between average papillae surface area and rumen propionate molar concentration (R 2 = 0. 18).

These were fed to 20 kg Corriedale lambs under feedlot conditions. The growth rates of the lambs fed the treated diets were higher than those fed the untreated diets in all cases, but the differences were not statistically significant. Feed intakes were highest with the diets containing <b>linseed</b> <b>meal</b> (P< 0. 0 5). The wool growth rates of lambs fed the treated diets were higher than those fed the untreated diets, but the difference was significant only {{in the case of the}} wheat diet (PC 0. 05). Increasing the level of the protein meals in the diets to 20; (about 15. 8 % CP) resulted in increased rates of weight gain with the untreated diets but decreased weight gains and feed intakes in the case of the treated diets. At the higher protein level the feed intakes and growth rates of lambs fed the untreated <b>linseed</b> <b>meal</b> diet were greater (P< 0. 05) than those of the lambs on the treated <b>linseed</b> <b>meal</b> diet. No other differences between treated and untreated diets were significant. Investigation into methods of applying formalin to hammermilled wheat showed that neither the dilution of the applied formalin nor the air temperature at the time of application had any marked effect on the amount of formaldehyde bound. The use of unsealed containers for storage of the wheat immediately after treatment caused a reduction in the amount of formaldehyde bound.

The results thus obtained are summarized as follows : 1. This disease was due to poisoning by ingested <b>linseed</b> <b>meal</b> treated with mercurial fungicide, "Ceresan". 2. Out {{of a total of}} 171 cases fed with the <b>linseed</b> <b>meal,</b> 29 cases fell into sickness, 10 cases of which died or were slaughtered. 3. The outstanding symptoms were fever attack, depression and anorexia, decline in milk secretion, bronchial catarrh, pathological changes in skin, lachrymation, salivation and diarrhea, swelling of lymphnodes, anemia and petechiae on the visible mucous membranes, and cardiac disturbance. 4. Marked anemia and neutrophilia with nuclear shift to the left were observed in the severe cases, but in the slight cases, lymphocytosis was found. 5. Biochemically, an increase of glucose in serum was distinct. 6. In mercurialism of cattle, it seems that the onset differs with the individual sensitivity to mercury...|$|E
40|$|The Department of Animal Husbandry has {{recently}} received {{a number of}} requests {{for information on the}} need of salt for fattening pigs when the ration was corn and tankage with alfalfa hay or pasture. The answer to these inquiries has always been that pigs did not need salt when they received tankage or some similar protein supplement of animal origin; but if most of the protein supplement was of plant origin as soybean meal, cottonseed meal, alfalfa meal, or <b>linseed</b> <b>meal,</b> salt was advisable...|$|E
40|$|Vigofac, {{put out by}} Chas. Pfizer & Co., {{is another}} {{additive}} that has recently come into the pig-feeding arena. It was thought desirable to compare it with antibiotics for fattening pigs on pasture. In this test four lots of spring pigs were self-fed free choice a basal ration of shelled corn and a mixed protein supplement on alfalfa pasture. The mixed protein supplement {{was made up of}} 4 parts tankage, 4 parts soybean meal, 1 part <b>linseed</b> <b>meal,</b> and 1 part alfalfa meal. Lot 1 pigs received no Vigofac or antibiotic. They were self-fed the basal ration of a mixed protein supplement and shelled corn. Lot 2 pigs were self-fed shelled corn and a mixed protein supplement to which had been added Vigofac at the rato of 27 pounds to the ton...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} problems of the swine industry is disease. Antibiotics have been demonstrated to be effective in keeping some diseases at a low level. The nitrofurans have shown good results for certain specific diseases in poultry. Their effect in swine feeding is little known, for few experiments have been carried on feeding them to swine. This experiment was initiated to study the effect of furazolidone nf- 180 in rations for growing and fattening swine. In this test four lots of fall pigs were self-fed free choice a basal ration of shelled corn and a mixed protein supplement in dry lot in winter. The mixed protein supplement was made up of 4 parts tankage, 4 parts soybean meal, 1 part <b>linseed</b> <b>meal,</b> and 1 part alfalfa meal...|$|E
