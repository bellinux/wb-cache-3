40|$|Publication bias in {{meta-analysis}} is {{a serious}} issue as it may lead to biased estimates which appear to be precise. A popular method for detecting and adjusting the publication bias is the trim and fill method. This study uses simulated meta-analysis to quantify the effects of publication bias on the overall meta-analysis estimates of continuous data where the absolute mean difference was utilized as the measure of effect. It additionally evaluates {{the performance of the}} trim and fills method for adjusting the publication bias in terms of statistical bias, the standard errors and the coverage probability. The results demonstrate that if the publication bias is not adjusted it could lead to up to 40 % biased in treatment effect estimates. Utilization of the trim and fill method has reduced the bias in the overall effect estimate by more than half. It is optimum in presence of moderate underlying bias but has minimal effects in presence of low and severe bias. Additionally, the trim and fill method improves the coverage probability by more than half when subjected to the same level of publication bias as those of the unadjusted data. However, the method tends to produce false positive results. A sensitivity analysis suggests that the trim and fill method will <b>incorrectly</b> <b>adjust</b> the data for publication bias between 10 - 45 % of the time (for the 5 % nominal level). Although the data was <b>incorrectly</b> <b>adjusted,</b> {{it was found that the}} Percentage Relative Bias (PRB) introduced into the estimates due to this adjustment is minimal (min: 0. 007 %, max: 0. 109 %) and coverage probability for estimates based on this <b>incorrectly</b> <b>adjusted</b> data is not significantly different from those of which is correctly not adjusted. Therefore the trim and fill method is recommended be routinely used when conducting meta-analysis. ...|$|R
30|$|Rucksack palsy is a {{traction}} injury of {{the upper}} brachial plexus that is caused by pressure from the shoulder straps [16, 39]. This condition can cause numbness, paralysis, cramping and minor pain in the shoulder girdle, elbow flexors and wrist extensors [16], which can severely limit soldier functionality. Excessive load and <b>incorrectly</b> <b>adjusted</b> shoulder straps have been cited as potential causative factors for rucksack palsy [16, 39]. Hip belts are used to alleviate this by distributing load from the shoulders to the hips [16, 39].|$|R
50|$|Television has {{traditionally}} been the most common source of seizures in PSE. For people with PSE, it is especially hazardous to view television in a dark room, at close range, or when the television is out of adjustment and is showing a rapidly flickering image (as when the horizontal hold is <b>incorrectly</b> <b>adjusted).</b> Modern digital television sets that cannot be maladjusted in this way and refresh {{the image on the}} screen at very high speed present less of a risk than older television sets.|$|R
50|$|Lawyer lips or lawyer tabs (a type of {{positive}} retention device) are tabs fitted to the fork ends {{on the front}} fork of bicycles sold in some countries (particularly the U.S.) to prevent a wheel from leaving the fork if the quick release skewer comes undone. They were introduced in response to lawsuits supported by experts including John Howard, in cases where <b>incorrectly</b> <b>adjusted</b> quick release wheels {{came out of the}} forks. Lawyer tabs are designed to compensate for the fact that many riders {{do not know how to}} operate a quick release properly: some riders treat them as a folding wing nut, and others do not tighten them enough for fear of snapping them or shearing the skewer (both are not likely given the normal range of human strength, and the mechanical advantages involved, as long as the skewer is not damaged or flawed).|$|R
40|$|Field {{investigations}} {{illustrate that}} it is not realistic to expect new high-tech equipment to function for a full life expectancy at high efficiency without significant operations and maintenance (O&M). A simple walk through inspection of most buildings reveals extensive equipment that is being operated on manual override, is <b>incorrectly</b> <b>adjusted</b> and operating inefficiently, or is simply inoperative. This point is illustrated with two examples at Robins Air Force Base, Georgia. The first describes development of a comprehensive, base-wide, steam trap maintenance program. The second describes a measured evaluation from a typical office building. The objective of both examples was to assess the importance of proper O&M. The proposed ``O&M First`` philosophy will result in more efficient building HVAC operation, provide improved services to the building occupants, and reduce energy consumption and unscheduled equipment repair/replacement. Implementation of a comprehensive O&M program will result in a 15 [...] 25 % energy savings. The O&M foundation that is established will allow other energy conservation activities such is demand side management or energy management and control systems, to achieve and maintain their expected energy savings...|$|R
40|$|In confounding, {{the effect}} of the {{exposure}} of interest is mixed with {{the effect of}} another variable. It is important to identify relevant confounders and remove the confounding effect as much as possible. There are three criteria that need to be fulfilled to determine whether a variable could be considered a potential confounder. The first criterion is that the variable needs {{to be associated with the}} exposure. The second criterion is that the variable needs to be associated with the outcome or disease. The third criterion is that the variable should not be an intermediate variable in the causal pathway between exposure and outcome. Only if all the criteria are fulfilled is the variable under question a confounder. If one <b>incorrectly</b> <b>adjusts</b> for a variable that is not a confounder, one risks overadjustment or adjustment for spurious associations. Confounders can be prevented from entering the study, during the design of a study, or if this is not possible, one can try to remove it during the analysis phase. Copyright (C) 2010 S.

50|$|A {{knowledge}} of the Simon effect is useful {{in the design of}} man-machine interfaces. Aircraft cockpits, for example, require a person to react quickly to a situation. Imagine that you are flying a plane and {{there is a problem with}} the left engine. In an aircraft with a good man-machine interface design (which most have), the indicator light for the left engine should be positioned physically to the left of the indicator light for the right engine. This interface would display information in a way that matches the types of responses that people should make. If it were the other way around, you may respond <b>incorrectly</b> and <b>adjust</b> the wrong engine.|$|R
50|$|Critics {{regard the}} {{procedure}} as a paradigmatic example of data dredging, intense computation often being an inadequate substitute for subject area expertise. Additionally, {{the results of}} stepwise regression are often used <b>incorrectly</b> without <b>adjusting</b> them for the occurrence of model selection. Especially the practice of fitting the final selected model as if no model selection had taken place and reporting of estimates and confidence intervals as if least-squares theory were valid for them, {{has been described as}} a scandal. Widespread incorrect usage and the availability of alternatives such as ensemble learning, leaving all variables in the model, or using expert judgement to identify relevant variables have led to calls to totally avoid stepwise model selection.|$|R
40|$|Abstract__ Humans {{constantly}} {{interact with}} {{objects in the}} environment (e. g. grasp a pencil for writing or pick up a cup of tea) without making many mistakes in these performed actions. To guide these actions, visual information is used. In order to accurately grasp {{and pick up the}} pencil, vision provides information such as the size of the pencil and its position relative to the body and other objects in the environment. But what happens if the interpretation of the visual information differs from physical reality? When this happens, an illusion is experienced (Gillam, 1998; Gregory, 1998). In our everyday experiences, we often perceive the world inaccurately. For example, when a car drives by, at a certain speed it looks like the wheels are turning backwards. Furthermore, distances appear shorter and hills appear steeper than they really are (Proffitt et al., 1995). And estimating a distance from a map is inaccurate when Muller-Lyer elements (figure 1. 2 b) are present in the map (Gillan et al., 1999). Are these visual illusions also reflected in our actions? Sometimes they are and the performed action does not have the intended goal. When flying an airplane, an illusion of motion direction can make the pilot <b>incorrectly</b> <b>adjust</b> the flying direction, which can cause an accident (Shebilske, 1981). Visual illusions are a tool to fmd out how (illusory) visual information is processed and how this information influences visually guided actions. Most theories of visual perception try to explain how the visual system acb,ieves normal veridical perception. However, veridical perception carmot easily discriminate among such theories. They can better be tested with stimuli that will result in an unrealistic percept in one theory and not in others. In this thesis, geometrical-optical illusions are used to test different theories that try to explain how the visual system processes (illusory) visual information. Gillam (1998) defmed these illusions as simple line drawings in which one or another metric property is wrongly perceived. In the next part, theories regarding the processing of (illusory) visual information are described...|$|R
50|$|Both the {{civilian}} SSR {{and the military}} IFF have become much more complex than their war-time ancestors, but remain compatible with each other, not least to allow military aircraft to operate in civil airspace. Today's SSR can provide much more detailed information, for example, the aircraft altitude, as well as enabling the direct exchange of data between aircraft for collision avoidance. Most SSR systems rely on Mode C transponders, which report the aircraft pressure altitude. The pressure altitude is independent from the pilot's altimeter setting, thus preventing false altitude transmissions if altimeter is <b>adjusted</b> <b>incorrectly.</b> Air traffic control systems recalculate reported pressure altitudes to true altitudes {{based on their own}} pressure references, if necessary.|$|R
5000|$|Older {{televisions}} {{for positive}} modulation systems were sometimes {{equipped with a}} peak video signal inverter that would turn the white interference spots dark. This was usually user-adjustable with a control on {{the rear of the}} television labeled [...] "White Spot Limiter" [...] in Britain or [...] "Antiparasite" [...] in France. If <b>adjusted</b> <b>incorrectly</b> it would turn bright white picture content dark. Most of the positive modulation television systems ceased operation by the mid-1980s. The French System L continued on up to the transition to digital broadcasting. Positive modulation was one of several unique technical features that originally protected the French electronics and broadcasting industry from foreign competition and rendered French TV sets incapable of receiving broadcasts from neighboring countries.|$|R
5000|$|Training wheels {{that prevent}} the bike from leaning also prevent countersteering, so that, {{as with a}} tricycle, {{children}} learn to turn the handlebars the wrong way, which must be unlearned later. Sheldon Brown wrote that training wheels can become an obstacle to learning if they are <b>adjusted</b> <b>incorrectly,</b> because they prevent the bike from leaning if they are too low, and can inhibit braking if too much weight is taken off the rear wheel by training wheels that are too low. Adjusting training wheels correctly, and raising them higher as the child's skill increases, avoids these problems. [...] Alternatives to using training wheels include removing the pedals from a child's bike, or balance bicycles.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a neural network {{architecture}} that is capable of continuous learning multiple, possibly overlapping, arbitrary input sequences relatively quickly, autonomously and online. The architecture of this network has been constructed according to design principles derived from neuroscience and existing work on recurrent network models. The network utilizes sigmoid-pulse generating spiking neurons together with a Hebbian learning rule with synaptic noise. Combined with coincidence detection and an internal feedback mechanism, this leads to a learning process that is driven by dynamic adjustment of the learning rate. This gives the network the ability to not only <b>adjust</b> <b>incorrectly</b> recalled parts of a sequence but also to reinforce and stabilize the recall of previously acquired sequences. The performance of the network is tested with a set of overlapping sequences from an existing problem domain and the relative contribution from each design principle is analyzed...|$|R
5000|$|Manufacturers {{of balance}} {{bicycles}} say {{that children can}} learn to bicycle faster because they learn to balance and countersteer first and then to pedal later, and that training wheels slow learning because kids become too dependent on them, acquiring bad habits. Pediatricians [...] {{say that there is}} no evidence that children learn to bike faster without training wheels. Training wheels that prevent the bike from leaning also prevent countersteering, so that, as with a tricycle, kids learn to turn the handlebars the wrong way, which must be unlearned later. Sheldon Brown wrote that training wheels can become an obstacle to learning if they are <b>adjusted</b> <b>incorrectly,</b> because they prevent the bike from leaning if they are too low, and can inhibit braking if too much weight is taken off the rear wheel by training wheels that are too low. Adjusting training wheels correctly, and raising them higher as the child's skill increases, avoids these problems. Balance bikes with no brakes at all except the rider's feet might stop poorly as well, though very young children might not use brakes effectively anyway. Brown recommended simply removing the pedals from a normal kid's bicycle, avoiding the extra expense of a balance bike, and parents have had success with this approach.|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} of genes contributing to complex diseases and quantitative traits requires genetic data of high fidelity, because undetected errors and mutations can profoundly affect linkage information. The recent {{emphasis on the}} use of the sibling-pair design eliminates or decreases the likelihood of detection of genotyping errors and marker mutations through apparent Mendelian incompatibilities or close double recombinants. In this article, we describe a hidden Markov method for detecting genotyping errors and mutations in multilocus linkage data. Specifically, we calculate the posterior probability of genotyping error or mutation for each sibling-pair-marker combination, conditional on all marker data and an assumed genotype-error rate. The method is designed for use with sibling-pair data when parental genotypes are unavailable. Through Monte Carlo simulation, we explore the effects of map density, marker-allele frequencies, marker position, and genotype-error rate on the accuracy of our error-detection method. In addition, we examine the impact of genotyping errors and error detection and correction on multipoint linkage information. We illustrate that even moderate error rates can result in substantial loss of linkage information, given efforts to fine-map a putative disease locus. Although simulations suggest that our method detects ⩽ 50 % of genotyping errors, it generally flags those errors that have the largest impact on linkage results. For high-resolution genetic maps, removal of the errors identified by our method restores most or nearly all the lost linkage information and can be accomplished without generating false evidence for <b>linkage</b> by removing <b>incorrectly</b> identified errors. ...|$|R
