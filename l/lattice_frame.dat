While Gotha had built copies of the Caudron G.3 as the LD.3 and LD.4, the resulting aircraft had more in common with the contemporary AGO C.I and C.II as similar molded booms were used instead of a <b>lattice</b> <b>frame,</b> and the Caudron used a tractor engine.

40|$|The {{employment}} of proper codings, {{such as the}} base- 2 coding, has allowed to establish the universal approximation property of Boolean functions: if a sufficient number b of inputs (bits) is taken, {{they are able to}} approximate arbitrarily well any real Borel measurable mapping. However, if the reduced set of monotone Boolean functions, whose expression involves only and and or operators, is considered, the standard approach points out significant limitations in their approximation capability. These limitations can be overcome by introducing new specific codings, called <b>lattice</b> coding and <b>frame</b> coding, which permit to show that also monotone Boolean functions possess the universal approximation property. The characteristics of these codings are analyzed in details, focusing on the ability of preserving metric and ordering. In particular, a comparison with classical base- 2 coding shows that the <b>lattice</b> and the <b>frame</b> coding require an increase of O(log b) and of O (√ b), respectively, in the number of bits.

40|$|The vast {{offshore}} wind resource represents a potential to use wind turbines installed offshore to power {{much of the}} world. Design standardization is difficult, however, because offshore sites vary significantly through differences in water depth, soil type, and wind and wave severity. To ensure that {{offshore wind}} turbine installations are cost effective, {{the use of a}} variety of support structure types is required. These types include fixed-bottom monopiles, gravity bases, and space-frames—such as tripods and <b>lattice</b> <b>frames</b> (“jackets”) —and floating structures. In this context, the offshore wind industry faces many new design challenges. Wind turbines are designed and analyzed using simulation tools (i. e., design codes) capable of predicting the coupled dynamic loads and responses of the system. Land-based wind turbine analysis relies on the use of aero-servo-elastic codes, which incorporate wind-inflow, aerodynamic (aero), control system (servo), and structural-dynamic (elastic) models in the time domain in a coupled simulation environment. In recent years, some of these codes have been expanded to include the additional dynamics pertinent to offshore installations, including the incident waves, sea current, hydrodynamics, and foundation dynamics of the support structure. The sophistication of these aero-hydro-servo-elastic codes, and the limited data available with which to validate them, underscore the need to verify their accuracy and correctness. Th...|$|R

In this work, we generalize the formalism to the case where the total momentum of the particles is non-zero; i. e. the <b>lattice</b> <b>frame</b> is not the center-of-mass frame of the scattering particles. There are several advantages to this procedure including making {{a wider variety of}} center of mass energies accessible with a fixed lattice volume, and making the avoided level crossing in a P-wave decay occur with a smaller volume.

After its introduction in 2013, chayote (Sechium edule), a gourd grown on bamboo <b>lattice</b> <b>frames,</b> became an important cash crop. To evaluate people’s use of this crop and to measure the effect of this increase on slow loris behavior, home ranges, and sleep sites, we conducted interviews with local farmers and analysed the above variables in relation to chayote expansion between 2011 and 2015. Interviews with farmers in 2011, 2013, and 2015 confirm the importance of chayote and of bamboo and slow lorises in their agricultural practices. In 2015 chayote frames covered 12 % of land in Cipaganti, occupying 4 % of slow loris home ranges, which marginally yet insignificantly increased in size with the increase in chayote. Slow lorises are arboreal and the bamboo frames increased connectivity within their ranges.
