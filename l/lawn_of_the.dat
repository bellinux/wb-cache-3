Corn is the primary crop produced in Wappocomo's agricultural fields along the South Branch Potomac River, which consist of rich alluvial soils.|$|E
5|$|Obama's {{predecessors}} Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush {{supported the}} organic movement by instructing the White House kitchens to buy organic food, and Obama extended their efforts toward healthy eating by planting the White House Kitchen Garden, an organic garden, the first White House vegetable garden since Eleanor Roosevelt served as First Lady, and installing bee hives, on the South <b>Lawn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> White House. The garden supplied organic produce and honey to the First Family and for state dinners and other official gatherings.|$|E
5|$|There were no Puerto Rican military-related {{fatalities}} in the Japanese {{attack of}} Pearl Harbor. However, {{there was one}} civilian Puerto Rican fatality. Daniel LaVerne was a Puerto Rican amateur boxer who was working at Pearl Harbor's Red Hill underground fuel tank construction project when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. He {{died as a result}} of the injuries which he received during the attack.

5|$|U.S. flags {{flown by}} the federal {{government}} were displayed at half-staff from January 9, 2011 until sunset on January 15, 2011 in honor of the victims of the Tucson shooting. A national moment of silence was held at 11:00a.m. EST on January 10, 2011 on the South <b>Lawn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> White House as well as the steps of the United States Capitol.

5|$|A {{little over}} {{an hour after the}} committee's meeting, Governor Taylor {{declared}} a state of insurrection and called out the state militia. He called the legislature into special session, not in Frankfort, but in heavily Republican London, which he insisted was a safer location. Defiant Democratic legislators refused to heed the call to London, but when they attempted to convene first in the state capitol and later in other public locations in Frankfort, they found the doors barred by armed citizens. On January 31, 1900, they convened secretly in a Frankfort hotel, with no Republicans present, and voted to certify the findings of the contest committee, invalidating enough votes to make Goebel governor. Goebel was sworn in, and immediately ordered the state militia to stand down. He also ordered the General Assembly to reconvene in Frankfort. The Republican militia refused to disband, and a rival Democratic militia formed across the <b>lawn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state capitol. Civil war seemed possible.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the afternoon, nearly 300armed men had {{converged on}} the <b>lawn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State Capitol. Brooks' men seized the state arsenal and began turning the Statehouse into an armed camp. Telegrams covered in {{signatures}} were sent to President Ulysses S. Grant supporting Brooks as the legal governor. Three out of the five Supreme Court justices also telegraphed the President in support of Brooks. Brooks telegraphed the President himself asking for access to weapons housed at the federal arsenal. He also issued a statement to the press proclaiming himself governor. The senators from the state, Clayton and Steven Dorsey, met with President Grant, and they sent a message to Brooks giving their support.|$|E
50|$|By {{the eighteenth}} century, {{buildings}} started {{to appear on}} the Old Steine. The first building to appear on <b>the</b> eastern side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Steine was a circulating library built in 1760. <b>The</b> eastern <b>lawns</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Royal Pavilion, originally built as a seaside retreat for George, Prince of Wales, were at one time considered part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Steine.|$|R

50|$|A 4-metre {{statue of}} Hertzog was erected in 1977 at <b>the</b> front <b>lawns</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union Building. The statue was taken down on 22 November 2013.

The statue was removed {{to make way for}} a 9 metre high statue of Nelson Mandela.|$|R
5|$|Sometimes trace fossils {{have been}} {{referred}} to Megalosaurus or to the ichnogenus Megalosauripus. In 1997, a famous group of fossilised footprints (ichnites) {{was found in a}} limestone quarry at Ardley, twenty kilometres northeast of Oxford. They were thought to have been made by Megalosaurus and possibly also some left by Cetiosaurus. There are replicas of some of these footprints, set across the <b>lawn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oxford University Museum of Natural History. One track was of a theropod accelerating from walking to running. According to Benson, such referrals are unprovable, as the tracks show no traits unique to Megalosaurus. Certainly they should be limited to finds that are of the same age as Megalosaurus bucklandii.|$|E
5|$|The Panic of 1893 had damaged labor {{conditions}} {{across the}} United States, and {{the victory of}} anti-silver legislation worsened the mood of western laborers. A group of workingmen led by Jacob S. Coxey began to march east toward Washington, D.C. to protest Cleveland's policies. This group, known as Coxey's Army, agitated {{in favor of a}} national roads program to give jobs to workingmen, and a weakened currency to help farmers pay their debts. By the time they reached Washington, only a few hundred remained, and when they were arrested the next day for walking on the <b>lawn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States Capitol, the group scattered. Even though Coxey's Army may not have been a threat to the government, it signaled a growing dissatisfaction in the West with Eastern monetary policies.|$|E
5|$|The first White House Astronomy Night {{was held}} on the South Lawn on October 7, 2009. This first event coincided with the International Year of Astronomy. Science Advisor to the President John Holdren stood next to President Obama as the {{president}} made a speech wherein he emphasized the values of science education and how crucial it was to society to increase the interest of youth towards studying science. This was an attempt by the White House to increase motivation for children to enter science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Only optical telescopes were used to peer at the heavens during the events. Over twenty such telescopes were placed on the South <b>Lawn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> White House in addition to displays of Moon rocks, meteorites, and presentations of the Solar System.|$|E

On their second run, they dropped bombs and napalm before firing rockets and strafing the presidential compound with machine-gun fire. The two continued their runs for 30 minutes before units loyal to the president arrived and launched a counter-attack.|$|R

5|$|The palace {{building}} {{consists of}} four floors built with timber, mud bricks, clay, and soil mortar. A carved wooden gate that Yabgo Raja Hatim Khan took from a fort in Skardu after conquering most of the Baltistan was erected {{at the entrance of}} the palace. The passage beyond the main gate, which formerly housed a stable, leads to the front <b>lawn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> palace, which was used by the musical band during festivities in the reign of Yabgo Rajas. The wooden ceiling of the palace is crafted with designs using chisel and paint, without the use of nail. A hall at the top floor that was used as a leisure room overlooks the Karakoram mountain range and the lawns around the palace. Other notable rooms of the palace include the Royal meeting room (Chogoraftal), Royal balcony (Chogojarokh), Princess dressing room (Lainakhang), and Queen room.|$|E
