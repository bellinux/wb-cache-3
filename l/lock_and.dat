5|$|Datchet Bridge, {{also known}} as The Divided Bridge, was a road bridge which crossed the River Thames at Datchet from 1706 until it was {{demolished}} in 1848. It was situated on the reach between Old Windsor <b>Lock</b> <b>and</b> Romney <b>Lock</b> <b>and</b> linked Windsor on the Berkshire bank to Datchet on the Buckinghamshire side. The bridge replaced a ferry service which had operated at the site {{since at least the}} middle of the 13th century.|$|E

The <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> dam were built {{to replace the}} wicket-type <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> dams Number 12, 13 and 14. Construction on the locks were started in 1967 and completed in 1972.

5|$|Kelston <b>Lock</b> <b>and</b> weir have {{permanent}} moorings {{above and}} below them. The Riverside Inn and Saltford Marina are also close by. Saltford <b>Lock</b> <b>and</b> weir are overlooked by {{the remains of the}} Kelston Brass Mill, which was working until 1925. It is a grade II listed building. Alongside the lock is a pub, whose garden extends over the lock to the small island between the <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> weir. The lock was opened in 1727 and destroyed in 1738 by rival coal dealers to stop the use of the river for transportation. In its heyday, between 1709 and 1859 Swineford had an active brass and copper industry around the Swineford Lock which were served by the river which also provided water power for the cloth industry, as did the River Boyd, a tributary which flows into the Avon near Bitton. Keynsham Lock opened in 1727. Just above the lock are some visitor moorings and a pub, on an island between the <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> the weir. The weir side of the island is also the mouth of the River Chew. Hanham is the last tidal lock, after which the river is joined by Brislington Brook.|$|E

5|$|Downriver of the Hells Canyon is the Lower Snake River Project, {{authorized}} by the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1945, which {{was created by the}} U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to create a navigable channel on the Snake River from its mouth to the beginning of Hells Canyon. These dams are, in downstream order: Lower Granite <b>Lock</b> <b>and</b> Dam, Little Goose <b>Lock</b> <b>and</b> Dam, Lower Monumental <b>Lock</b> <b>and</b> Dam, and Ice Harbor <b>Lock</b> <b>and</b> Dam. Dredging work was also done throughout the length of the navigation channel to facilitate ship passage. These dams form a cascade of reservoirs with no stretches of free-flowing river in between. Immediately below Ice Harbor Dam is Lake Wallula, formed by the construction of the McNary Dam on the Columbia River. (McNary Dam {{is not part of the}} Lower Snake River Project.) Above Lower Granite Dam, the river channel from Lewiston to Johnson Bar, just below Hells Canyon, is also maintained for jet-boats as this section is too rugged for ships. These dams have been proposed for removal, and if they were to be removed, it would be the largest dam removal project ever undertaken in the United States. The removal has been proposed on the grounds that it would restore salmon runs to the lower Snake River and the Clearwater River and other smaller tributaries. Idaho's Snake river once teemed with sockeye salmon. However, there are almost no wild sockeye salmon left in the river due to a number of factors.|$|E

5|$|Antibody and antigen {{interact}} by spatial complementarity (<b>lock</b> <b>and</b> key). The molecular forces {{involved in}} the Fab-epitope interaction are weak and non-specific – for example electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals forces. This means binding between antibody and antigen is reversible, and the antibody's affinity towards an antigen is relative rather than absolute. Relatively weak binding also means {{it is possible for}} an antibody to cross-react with different antigens of different relative affinities.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{creation}} of Chew Valley Lake and river level controls at Keynsham <b>Lock</b> <b>and</b> weir, Keynsham was prone to flooding.

25|$|Pacific salmon are anadromous; they hatch in lakes, rivers, and streams—or, {{nowadays}} fish hatcheries—migrate to sea, {{and only}} {{at the end of their}} life return to fresh water to spawn. When the Corps of Engineers first built the <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> dam, they changed the natural drainage route of Lake Washington. The <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> dam blocked all salmon runs out of the Cedar River watershed. To correct this problem, the Corps built a fish ladder as the locks were constructed to allow salmon to pass around the <b>locks</b> <b>and</b> dam.|$|R

The navigation included a <b>lock</b> <b>and</b> two or more half-locks, consisting of a pair of gates to hold back the water, and an agreement to build a towpath between Ham Mills and Taunton was reached in 1724.|$|E
