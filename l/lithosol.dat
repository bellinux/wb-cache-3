50|$|Volcano rabbits are an {{endangered}} species endemic to Mexico. Specifically, the rabbit is native to four volcanoes just south of Mexico City, the largest of which is called El Pelado. The range of the volcano rabbit has been fragmented into 16 individual patches by human disturbance. Vegetation within the patches include Nearctic and Neotropical varieties. Elevation of these patches is between 2900 and 3660 meters above sea level. The soil consists mostly of Andosol and <b>Lithosol.</b> The local climate is temperate, subhumid, and has a mean annual temperature of 11 °C. Annual rainfall averages at about 1000 millimeters. In the patches that are the most heavily populated with volcano rabbits, the plants Festuca tolucensus and Pinus hartwegii are most abundant. Volcano rabbits show strong preferences for habitat types that are categorized as pine forests, open pine woodland, and mixed alder pine forest. Human activity in the area has had a great impact upon the preferred habitat of the volcano rabbit. Humans have fragmented the rabbits' habitat by constructing highways, farming, burning, and allowing grazing. Ecological fragmentation has been caused by environmental discontinuity.|$|E

The main aim {{of this study was to}} establish the most economic rate of N fertilizer when vegetable and grain soybean are used as fallow crops in sugarcane production systems. The following cane parameters were measured: LAI, biomass, N in leaves and sugarcane and sugar yields. Sugarcane variety N 14 was used in the experiment. Post vegetable soybean cane topdressed 1 with 80 kg Nha had the greatest LAI at 150 DAE. The highest biomass was realized on sugarcane 1 1 topdressed with 80 and 120 kg Nha. At final tiller stability post vegetable cane top dresses with 80 kg Nha had the most tiller population. N in leaves and cane and sugar yields were also highest on post vegetable 1 soybean cane and topdressed with kg Nha. Tiller density or population and biomass production are important crop variables that are used to estimate the final cane stalk population and sucrose yields. So 1 farmers can top-dress their cane with 80 kg Nha when vegetable soybean are used as fallow crops. This will help them save about 40 kg Nha. ...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 As the {{management}} of range lands is intensified or as improvement activity is increased, a critical need is seen to refine {{the understanding of the}} ecology of these lands. If soil surveys on range lands are to be meaningful and useful, the relationship between the fundamental ecological units and the taxonomic soil units must be clearly understood. This refined understanding of range resources is prerequisite to success in resource inventory (whether by range site, soils, or vegetation and soils mapping), in condition and trend measurement, and in wise location of range improvement projects. The urgent need for this knowledge of range ecology led to this study as a test of a simpler and faster ecological method for the accumulation of interpretable facts on the ecology of the Artemisia steppe vegetation. Using reconnaissance methods, vegetation and soils were studied together in the east central Owyhee Uplands near Jordan Valley, Oregon. Qualitative vegetation data, soil profile descriptions and information concerning other physical environmental factors were recorded at each study location.

The soil types are the mountainous Podzole and <b>Lithosol</b> with a thin humic layer on crystalline bedrock. Monitoring stations with data transfer to the internet are installed on several localities differing in the type of vegetation cover (in the grassland and dwarf pine above the forest margin, in the growth of mature spruce forest, and in the grassland below the spruce forest). The discharge at the closing profile is continuously recorded. Meteorological data are collected at a station close to the Výrovka chalet (1360 m a. s. l.) : year-round precipitation, solar radiation, wind speed and direction, air and soil temperatures and soil moisture. The long-term monitoring of the water balance of the headwater catchment Modrý potok and its soil water regime was evaluated taking into account the discontinuous character of water transport in an unsaturated zone. Extreme runoffs in a vegetation season are caused by these factors: (1) oversaturation of the soil profile, (2) water repellency of the soil surface, (3) gravitationally destabilized flow of water in the soil profile, (4) extreme rainfall. The typical combinations are (1) and (3) – gravitationally destabilized flow of water can be caused even by a small rainfall under the oversaturation, (2) and (4) – long-term drought can cause the water repellency of the soil surface and the extreme rainfall.

These tools allow us to explore the behavior of soil related processes and properties as well as to generate new hypotheses for future experimentation. A good model and analysis of soil properties variations, that permit us to extract suitable conclusions and estimating spatially correlated variables at unsampled locations, is clearly dependent on the amount and quality of data and of the robustness techniques and estimators. On the other hand, the quality of data is obviously dependent from a competent data collection procedure and from a capable laboratory analytical work. Following the standard soil sampling protocols available, soil samples should be collected according to key points such as a convenient spatial scale, landscape homogeneity (or non-homogeneity), land color, soil texture, land slope, land solar exposition. Obtaining good quality data from forest soils is predictably expensive as it is labor intensive and demands many manpower and equipment both in field work and in laboratory analysis. Also, the sampling collection scheme that should be used on a data collection procedure in forest field is not simple to design as the sampling strategies chosen are strongly dependent on soil taxonomy. In fact, a sampling grid {{will not be able to}} be followed if rocks at the predicted collecting depth are found, or no soil at all is found, or large trees bar the soil collection. Considering this, a proficient design of a soil data sampling campaign in forest field is not always a simple process and sometimes represents a truly huge challenge. In this work, we present some difficulties that have occurred during two experiments on forest soil that were conducted in order to study the spatial variation of some soil physical-chemical properties. Two different sampling protocols were considered for monitoring two types of forest soils located in NW Portugal: umbric regosol and <b>lithosol.</b> Two different equipments for sampling collection were also used: a manual auger and a shovel. Both scenarios were analyzed and the results achieved have allowed us to consider that monitoring forest soil in order to do some mathematical and statistical investigations needs a sampling procedure to data collection compatible to established protocols but a pre-defined grid assumption often fail when the variability of the soil property is not uniform in space. In this case, sampling grid should be conveniently adapted from one part of the landscape to another and this fact should be taken into consideration of a mathematical procedure...|$|E
50|$|Bristlecone pines grow in {{isolated}} groves {{just below the}} tree line, between 1700 and 3400 m elevation on dolomitic soils. The trees grow in soils that are shallow <b>lithosols,</b> usually derived from dolomite and sometimes limestone, and occasionally sandstone or quartzite soils. Dolomite soils are alkaline, high in calcium and magnesium, and low in phosphorus. Those factors tend to exclude other plant species, allowing bristlecones to thrive. Because of cold temperatures, dry soils, high winds, and short growing seasons, the trees grow very slowly. Even the tree's needles, which grow in bunches of five, can remain on the tree for forty years, which gives the tree's terminal branches the unique appearance of a long bottle brush.|$|R
40|$|Câmpulung Muşcel is a subcarpathian depression, {{situated}} {{between the}} Damboviţa Valley to the East and Bratia Valley to the West, {{limited to the}} North by the Iezer-Păpuşa Mountains and to the South by the subcarpathian hills of Măţău, Ciuha Teiului, Ciocanu. The soil cover is mostly made of luvisols, faeozioms, rendzinas, <b>lithosols</b> and aluvosols. The main sources of soil degradation are: deforesting, industrial activities, overgrazing and agricultural activities, the first two dominating. The intense degradation processes extended in the East and Central sectors, are represented by dislocation, overgrowing and pollution by residual powders. The negative anthropic impact upon the soil cover is important {{and has to be}} diminished, through interventions upon degradation sources...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the pools and distributions of soil phosphorus (P) in the top 50 cm of soil in China by {{using a combination of}} total and available P information from more than 2400 soil profiles and a map of soil types at a resolution of 1 : 1, 000, 000. Our estimates indicate that the average total P density and available P density in China are about 8. 3 X 10 (2) g/ m(3) and 5. 4 g/m(3), respectively. The total national soil P pool in the surface half meter is 3. 5 Pg (10 (15) g). The available P density ranges from 0. 7 g/m(3) in the <b>Lithosols</b> to 16. 7 g/ m(3) in the Irrigated Silting Soils. The total P density ranges from 1. 2 X 10 (2) g/m(3) in the <b>Lithosols</b> to 19 X 10 (2) g/m(3) in the Frigid Desert Soils. The ratio of available P to total P density ranges from 0. 6 X 10 (- 3) in Aeolian Soils to 21. 6 X 10 (- 3) in Coastal Solonchaks. The available P content and its vertical distribution show a complex pattern among soil orders of different development stages, possibly indicating the important role of biota's control over soil available P content. There are large variations of P content in different climatic regions. The tropical and subtropical region has the lowest available P density (4. 8 g/m(3)) and the second lowest total P density (8. 2 X 10 (2) g/m(3)) among all climatic regions. The large variation in the soil P content suggests that further study is needed to investigate climatic and land- use controls over the soil P content...|$|R
