5|$|The White House's {{most famous}} alleged {{apparition}} {{is that of}} Abraham Lincoln. Eleanor Roosevelt never admitted to having seen Lincoln's ghost, but did say that she felt his presence repeatedly throughout the White House. Mrs. Roosevelt {{also said that the}} family dog, Fala, would sometimes bark for no reason at what she felt was Lincoln's ghost. President Dwight Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty, and Liz Carpenter, press secretary to First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, both said they felt Lincoln's presence many times. The former president's footsteps are also said to be heard in the hall outside the <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom.</b> As reputable an eyewitness as Lillian Rogers Parks admitted in her autobiography My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House that she had heard them. Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry S. Truman, said she heard a specter rapping {{at the door of the}} <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom</b> when she stayed there, and believed it was Lincoln. President Truman himself was once wakened by raps at the door while spending a night in the <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom.</b> Others have actually seen an apparition of the former president. The first person reported to have actually seen Lincoln's spirit was First Lady Grace Coolidge, who said she saw the ghost of Lincoln standing at a window in the Yellow Oval Room staring out at the Potomac. Winston Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt, and Maureen Reagan and her husband have all claimed to have seen a spectral Lincoln in the White House. A number of staff members of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration claimed to have seen Lincoln's spirit, and on one occasion Roosevelt's personal valet ran screaming from the White House claiming he had seen Lincoln's ghost. Perhaps the most famous incident was in 1942 when Queen Wilhelmina of The Netherlands heard footsteps outside her White House bedroom and answered a knock on the door, only to see Lincoln in frock coat and top hat standing in front of her (she promptly fainted). Several unnamed eyewitnesses have claimed to have seen the shade of Abraham Lincoln actually lying down on the bed in the <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom</b> (which was used as a meeting room at the time of his administration), and others have seen Lincoln sit on the edge of the bed and put his boots on. The most famous eyewitness to the latter was Mary Eben, Eleanor Roosevelt's secretary, who saw Lincoln pulling on his boots (after which she ran screaming from the room).|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, Bill and Hillary Clinton {{refurbished}} some {{rooms with}} the assistance of Arkansas decorator Kaki Hockersmith, including the Oval Office, the East Room, Blue Room, State Dining Room, <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom,</b> and Lincoln Sitting Room. During the administration of George W. Bush, First Lady Laura Bush refurbished the <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom</b> in a style contemporary with the Lincoln era; the Green Room, Cabinet Room, and theater were also refurbished.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom</b> and the Lincoln Sitting Room {{are located}} in the {{southeast}} corner of the Second Floor. As originally designed and completed in 1809, this space contained two very narrow, north-south running bedchambers with a toilet room between them.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom</b> is {{a bedroom}} {{which is part}} of a guest suite located in the {{southeast}} corner of {{the second floor of the}} White House in Washington, D.C. The Lincoln Sitting Room makes up the other part of the suite. The room is named for President Abraham Lincoln, who used the room as an office.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} residence {{is in the}} center. Two colonnades—one on {{the east}} {{and one on the}} west—designed by Jefferson, now serve to connect the East and West Wings, added later. The Executive Residence houses the president's dwelling, as well as rooms for ceremonies and official entertaining. The State Floor of the residence building includes the East Room, Green Room, Blue Room, Red Room, State Dining Room, Family Dining Room, Cross Hall, Entrance Hall, and Grand Staircase. The Ground Floor is made up of the Diplomatic Reception Room, Map Room, China Room, Vermeil Room, Library, the main kitchen, and other offices. The second floor family residence includes the Yellow Oval Room, East and West Sitting Halls, the White House Master Bedroom, President's Dining Room, the Treaty Room, <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom</b> and Queens' Bedroom, as well as two additional bedrooms, a smaller kitchen, and a private dressing room. The third floor consists of the White House Solarium, Game Room, Linen Room, a Diet Kitchen, and another sitting room (previously used as President George W. Bush's workout room).|$|E
500|$|During the {{administration}} Howe's official title was Secretary to the President, a role {{equivalent to the}} current White House Chief of Staff posting. After FDR's inauguration, Howe took up residence in the White House <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom.</b> Howe described his role in {{the administration}} as the president's [...] "no-man", checking Roosevelt's natural enthusiasm and preventing unsound proposals from reaching wider discussion. He was also a strong supporter of the Civilian Conservation Corps, one of the many public works programs of Roosevelt's [...] "New Deal". Howe persuaded the Governor of Kentucky to name him an honorary colonel, echoing the name of President Wilson's famous advisor, Colonel House; later, Howe printed business cards containing all his nicknames, reading: [...] "Colonel Louis Rasputin Voltaire Talleyrand Simon Legree Howe".|$|E
500|$|In later years, {{the tunnel}} {{has been used}} by persons who needed to exit or depart the White House without public or press attention. Tricia Nixon and her husband, Edward F. Cox, {{departed}} the White House via the tunnel after their 1972 Rose Garden wedding. According to Bill Gulley, longtime head of the White House Military Office, the tunnel was used by male White House aides to sneak their girlfriends and mistresses into the building to have sexual intercourse in the <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom</b> during the presidencies of Lyndon Johnson and [...] Jimmy Carter. Lyndon Johnson also used the tunnel to avoid Vietnam War protesters when departing the White House. An allegation that the White House to Treasury Building tunnel was used by Bill Clinton to facilitate extramarital liaisons has been discredited.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom</b> for {{contributors}} controversy was an American political {{controversy in}} the 1990s during the Clinton Administration. It refers to the alleged selling of overnight stays in the <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom</b> in the White House in return for political campaign contributions. It occurred {{in the context of}} the larger and somewhat separately focused 1996 United States campaign finance controversy. No charges were made in connection to the <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom</b> matter.|$|E

50|$|President Truman was the {{individual}} who conceived of dedicating the space to Lincoln. The desk in the bedroom was Lincoln's, and the 8 ft long, 6 ft wide rosewood bed is probably the one Willie Lincoln died in. The portrait of President Andrew Jackson that hangs {{in the room is}} one which Abraham Lincoln admired, and the <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom</b> has the only known copy of the Gettysburg Address signed, dated, and titled by Lincoln himself. The sitting room furnishings were all purchased by First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln. They include four mahogany chairs, a chest in the late Empire style, and red and gold rugs and drapes. The small mahogany desk in the sitting room was constructed by James Hoban himself. The <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom</b> and Sitting Room were redecorated by First Lady Laura Bush, who changed the decor so it more accurately reflected tastes common during the American Civil War. The <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom</b> is usually used to house close friends of the President who are visiting the White House.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom</b> and the Lincoln Sitting Room {{are located}} in the {{southeast}} corner of the Second Floor. As originally designed and completed in 1809, this space contained two very narrow, north-south running bedchambers with a toilet room between them.|$|E
50|$|The {{room has}} been {{furnished}} in 1868 Federal style since the Truman reconstruction. The bed {{thought to have}} belonged to Andrew Jackson is used here. It was donated in 1902 and first used in what is today the <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom.</b>|$|E
50|$|Reportedly, Rex took a disliking to the <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom</b> in the White House. Thought to {{possibly}} be {{haunted by the}} ghost of Abraham Lincoln, the dog would refuse to enter the room and sometimes would stand outside it and bark through the doorway.|$|E
50|$|Starting in 1984, Elliot Roosevelt wrote {{a series}} of detective novels casting his real-life mother Eleanor Roosevelt {{in the role of}} a crimesolving sleuth, with titles like Murder and the First Lady, Murder in the Oval Office, and Murder in the <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom</b> and the Lincoln Sitting Room {{are located}} in the {{southeast}} corner of the Second Floor. As originally designed and completed in 1809, this space contained two very narrow, north-south running bedchambers with a toilet room between them. By 1825, the toilet had been removed and the space joined to the west bedchamber to form the President's Office. This area was used for the President's office over the next several decades. Abraham Lincoln used it as both an office and a Cabinet room, and signed the Emancipation Proclamation in the <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom</b> in 1863. The Lincoln Sitting Room was used as an office for presidential aides, although President John Tyler used it as part of his office from 1841 to 1845.|$|E
5000|$|One {{particular}} {{document was}} most potentially damning, a Clinton annotation on a Democratic National Committee memorandum from its finance chair Terry McAuliffe, written regarding {{names of people}} who had not been in touch since the Bill Clinton presidential campaign, 1992: [...] "Yes, pursue all 3 and promptly - and get other names of the 100,000 or more contributors. Ready to start overnights right away - give me the top 10 list back, along with the 100." [...] A Washington Post report stated that: [...] "Clinton personally authorized a variety of perks for top party contributors, including golf games and morning jogs with him and overnight stays in the <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom</b> ..." [...] McAuliffe would later refer to this sardonically as [...] "the infamous <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom</b> Memo".|$|E
50|$|The <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom</b> {{was used}} as a guest bedroom until the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration, when it was {{occupied}} by Lorena Hickok (journalist and aide to First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt). After Roosevelt's death in 1945, it became the bedroom of Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry S. Truman.|$|E
50|$|The {{space was}} {{originally}} {{occupied by a}} bedroom suite known as the Prince of Wales Room. From 1929 to 1948, this suite {{was known as the}} <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom.</b> The bedroom suite was structurally changed in 1961 to create a dining room and kitchen in the First Family's residence.|$|E
5000|$|In {{response}} to the allegations, President Clinton said in February 1997, [...] "I {{did not have any}} strangers here. The <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom</b> was never sold. That was one more false story we have had to endure, and the facts will show what the truth is." [...] Senator John McCain was not convinced, saying of the documents, [...] "It does corroborate what we already suspected and what circumstantially was already known to us, and that is, {{that the president of the}} United States, in seeking to raise money for his re-election, was willing to use the <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom,</b> probably one of the more sacrosanct places in America, in order to gain those financial funds which he felt were necessary. And I'm deeply disappointed and I'm sure the American people will be too." ...|$|E
50|$|He painted {{at least}} nine posthumous portraits of Lincoln, basing them on the plaster life-mask {{that his father had}} made in 1860. One of them hangs in the <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom</b> at The White House. Another {{appeared}} on a U.S. postage stamp issued in the 1950s, and is now at the National Gallery of Art.|$|E
50|$|In Harry Turtledove's Southern Victory, another {{alternate}} history, Mahan {{is frequently}} mentioned but never appears. He is spoken of {{as having been}} President of the United States from 1889 to 1897, and the Mahan Bedroom is a famous room in the Powel House in Philadelphia, analogous to the actual <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom</b> in the White House.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Lincoln</b> <b>Bedroom</b> is {{a bedroom}} {{which is part}} of a guest suite located in the {{southeast}} corner of {{the second floor of the}} White House in Washington, D.C. The Lincoln Sitting Room makes up the other part of the suite. The room is named for President Abraham Lincoln, who used the room as an office.|$|E
