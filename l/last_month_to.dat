[...] The Brennan Center for Justice describes him as [...] "a key architect behind many of the nation’s anti-voter and anti-immigration policies."

After such behaviour, as I have witnessed during the <b>last</b> <b>month,</b> <b>to</b> Miss Smith--such attentions as I have been in the daily habit of observing--to be addressing me in this manner--this is an unsteadiness of character, indeed, which I had not supposed possible!

Without affectation, you sorely distress me, and I think you would hardly have done it could {{you know what a}} degree of anxiety you cause. Why, Paula, do you not write or send to me? What have I done that you should treat me like this? Do write, if it is only to reproach me. I am compelled to pass the greater part of the day in this castle, which reminds me constantly of you, and yet eternally lacks your presence. I am unfortunate indeed that you {{have not been able to}} find half-an-hour during the <b>last</b> <b>month</b> <b>to</b> tell me at least that you are alive.|$|E

'Isn't it enough to make a man crusty to see that little sprawler put up in the best {{business}} every night, and actually keeping money out of the house, by being forced down the people's throats, while other people are passed over? Isn't it extraordinary to see a man's confounded family conceit blinding him, even to his own interest? Why I KNOW of fifteen and sixpence that came to Southampton one night <b>last</b> <b>month,</b> <b>to</b> see me dance the Highland Fling; and what's the consequence?

30|$|Successful {{resuscitation}} after {{cardiac arrest}} or cerebral hypoxia {{can have an}} extremely wide variety of functional and cognitive consequences, ranging from transient cognitive or motor dysfunction lasting several weeks or months; to awakening after coma {{in a state of}} unawareness or inability <b>to</b> communicate <b>lasting</b> <b>months</b> <b>to</b> years or decades (e.g. as seen in vegetative or minimally conscious states) [137]. At present, the medical and economic impacts of differences in clinical management (including therapeutic hypothermia), care pathways and disparate health policies within Europe remain unclear.|$|R
60|$|We {{liked to}} be alone {{together}} that <b>last</b> <b>month,</b> <b>to</b> think the long, long thoughts of youth and talk about our futures. There had grown up between us that summer a bond of sympathy {{that did not exist}} between us and the others. We were older than they--the Story Girl was fifteen and I was nearly that; and all at once it seemed as if we were immeasurably older than the rest, and possessed of dreams and visions and forward-reaching hopes which they could not possibly share or understand. At times we were still children, still interested in childish things. But there came hours when we seemed to our two selves very grown up and old, and in those hours we talked our dreams and visions and hopes, vague and splendid, as all such are, over together, and so began to build up, out of the rainbow fragments of our childhood's companionship, that rare and beautiful friendship which was to last all our lives, enriching and enstarring them. For there is no bond more lasting than that formed by the mutual confidences of that magic time when youth is slipping from the sheath of childhood and beginning to wonder what lies for it beyond those misty hills that bound the golden road.|$|E
6000|$|SON. Perhaps. But Ahmed is not afraid. Listen! He says: [...] "If {{that man}} or even his {{brothers}} wish {{to come to}} France after me I shall be very pleased. If, in fact, anyone wishes to kill me, let them by all means come out. I am here present {{in the field of}} battle. I have placed my life on a tray. The people in our country who talk about killing are children. They have not seen the reality of things. We do not turn our heads when forty are killed at a breath. Men are swallowed up or blown apart here as one divides meat. When we are in the trenches, there is no time to strike a blow on the private account. When we are at rest in the villages, one's lust for killing has been satisfied. Two men joined us in the draft <b>last</b> <b>month</b> <b>to</b> look after a close friend of mine with whom they had a private account. They were great swash-bucklers at first. They even volunteered to go into the trenches though it was not their turn of duty. They expected that their private account could be settled during some battle. Since that turn of duty they have become quite meek. They had, till then, only seen men killed by ones and twos, half a mile separating them. This business was like killing flies on sugar. Have no fear for me, therefore, no matter who joins the Regiment. It needs a very fierce stomach to add anything to our Government rations." ...|$|E

40|$|Episodic {{paroxysmal}} hemicrania (EPH) {{is a rare}} disorder {{characterized by}} frequent, daily attacks of short-lived, unilateral headache with accompanying ipsilateral autonomic features.

We report a new case of EPH with a clear seasonal pattern: a 32 -year-old woman with a right-sided headache for 17 years. Pain occurred with a seasonal variation, with bouts <b>lasting</b> one <b>month</b> (usually in {{the first months of}} the year) and remission periods <b>lasting</b> around 11 <b>months.</b> During these periods she had headache from three to five times per day, lasting from 15 to 30 minutes, without any particular period preference. There were no precipitating or aggravating factors. Tearing and conjunctival injection accompanied ipsilaterally the pain. Previous treatments provided no pain relief. She completely responded to indomethacin 75 mg daily. After three years, the pain recurred with longer attack duration and was just relieved with prednisone. We also propose a new hypothesis: the EPH-cluster headache continuum...|$|R
