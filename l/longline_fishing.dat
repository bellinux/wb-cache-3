5|$|Of the 22 {{species of}} {{albatross}} recognised by the IUCN, all {{are listed as}} at some level of concern; 3 species are Critically Endangered, 5 species are Endangered, 7 species are Near Threatened, and 7 species are Vulnerable. Numbers of albatrosses have declined in the past due to harvesting for feathers, but today the albatrosses are threatened by introduced species, such as rats and feral cats that attack eggs, chicks and nesting adults; by pollution; by a serious decline in fish stocks in many regions largely due to overfishing; and by <b>longline</b> <b>fishing.</b> Longline fisheries pose the greatest threat, as feeding birds are attracted to the bait, become hooked on the lines, and drown. Identified stakeholders such as governments, conservation organisations {{and people in the}} fishing industry are all working toward reducing this bycatch.|$|E
5|$|Two days later, the Coast Guard cutter Chase took over, escorting the KD II to San Diego. Along {{the way the}} {{investigation}} continued. The Coast Guard reported that the four-man crew was cooperative with {{the investigation}}, largely sitting back and watching television in the lounge. Since they claimed not to have finned the sharks themselves, they believed they had not done anything wrong. Ship's records revealed that the KD II had met fishing vessels, primarily Korean <b>longline</b> <b>fishing</b> boats, at prearranged locations {{on the high seas}} near the Fiji and Solomon Islands and bought fins from them for a total of $250,000. On an earlier voyage that summer, the ship had made $6 million from shark fins obtained the same way. Korean-language records from a broker on board indicated an ongoing operation, giving the names of other ships involved. The refrigeration unit on board had broken before the ship had left Honolulu, and the fins were out on deck in an attempt to dry them out and reduce the odor.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, {{a project}} to tag the local fish, to analyze the population, was {{implemented}} by the NOAA, based on a plan proposed by fishermen in 1992. The first fish were tagged and released in August 1995.

50|$|Despite being {{known from}} only one specimen, {{the species is}} {{classified}} as data deficient by the IUCN. It is not the target of any fishery, {{but it may be}} unrecognized bycatch in several other fisheries, including those using <b>longlines,</b> <b>fish</b> traps, stake nets, and trawls. Like other elasmobrachs, this species is not likely consumed by the Shia population who fish in the area.|$|R

25|$|Attenborough has {{subsequently}} {{become more}} vocal in {{his support of}} environmental causes. In 2005 and 2006, he backed a BirdLife International project to stop the killing of albatross by <b>longline</b> <b>fishing</b> boats. He gave public support to WWF's campaign to have 220,000square kilometres of Borneo's rainforest designated a protected area. He {{also serves as a}} vice-president of BTCV, vice-president of Fauna and Flora International, president of Butterfly Conservation and president of Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust. In 2003, he launched an appeal on behalf of the World Land Trust to create a rainforest reserve in Ecuador in memory of Christopher Parsons, the producer of Life on Earth and a personal friend, who had died the previous year. The same year, he helped to launch ARKive, a global project instigated by Parsons to gather together natural history media into a digital library. ARKive is an initiative of Wildscreen, of which Attenborough is a patron. He later became patron of the World Land Trust, and an active supporter. He supported Glyndebourne in their successful application to obtain planning permission for a wind turbine in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and gave evidence at the planning inquiry arguing in favour of the proposal.|$|E
500|$|Of the 21 {{albatross}} species recognised by IUCN {{on their}} Red List, 19 are threatened, {{and the other}} two are [...] "near threatened". Three species (as recognised by the IUCN) are considered critically endangered: the Amsterdam albatross, Tristan albatross and waved albatross. One of the main threats is commercial <b>longline</b> <b>fishing,</b> as the albatrosses and other seabirds—which will readily feed on offal—are attracted to the set bait, become hooked on the lines and drown. An estimated 100,000 albatross per year are killed in this fashion. Unregulated pirate fisheries exacerbate the problem.|$|E
500|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature has {{listed the}} bignose shark as Data Deficient overall, due to {{inadequate}} population and fishery monitoring. The species {{is considered to}} be of concern, however, given it is slow-reproducing and faces widespread heavy fishing pressure. There is evidence that its numbers have recently declined in the Maldives. Furthermore, most bignose shark bycatch occurs in international waters, where a single stock may be affected by multiple fisheries. It is listed as a [...] "highly migratory species" [...] under the 1995 UN Agreement on the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, but thus far this has not led to significant conservation measures. Regionally, the IUCN has assessed the bignose shark as Near Threatened in the northwestern Atlantic. Though specific data are lacking, it is suspected to have declined there because it is commonly misidentified as the sandbar shark, thus the known decline in sandbar shark numbers resulting from US <b>longline</b> <b>fishing</b> may represent a decline in bignose shark numbers, as well. This species has been assessed as Least Concern in Australian waters, where it faces no significant threats.|$|E
40|$|On a {{total of}} 363 bottoms {{longline}} sets in the SW lagoon of New Caledonia, 45 were surveyed using visual census. Abundance and biomass estimates were derived from these censuses.

40|$|May 2000, and {{attended}} by approximately 75 biologists, resource managers and conservationists from many countries, reviewed {{the effects of}} longlining on albatrosses and petrels on a global scale. The workshop recognised that effective progress required a range of complementary and interlinked actions to: A. Develop and use appropriate multilateral, inter-governmental instruments, mechanisms and fora; B. Develop and improve practical means to reduce seabird bycatch and promote their wide and effective use; and C. Enhance science-based monitoring of seabird bycatch and population trends, complemented by relevant research into population structure, dynamics and foraging ecology.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{register}} the ecological knowledge of fishermen from the municipality of São João de Pirabas, Pará, Brazil, regarding the occurrence of sea turtles on the Pará state coast, as well as measure their incidental capture when fishing; to do this, 50 semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} local fishermen. Fishing was practiced mostly by adult men, who used 7 fishing arts (gillnetting, hook and line, <b>longline,</b> <b>fish</b> corrals, net of tide canals, casting net, and basket trap), mainly aimed at catching king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla), serra Spanish mackerel (S. brasiliensis), king weakfish (Macrodon ancylodon), weakfish (Cynoscion spp.), hake (Cynoscion spp.), catfish (Bagre bagre), and mullet (Mugil spp.). Fishermen observed in the region 5 turtle species, with a more frequent occurrence of Chelonia mydas (100 %), Dermochelys coriacea (66 %), and Eretmochelys imbricata (46 %); the less frequent species are Caretta caretta (16 %) and Lepidochelys olivacea (8 %). The spawning areas of the 3 most common species demonstrate the significance of the Pará state coast for their conservation. Incidental capture was reported by 76 % of fishermen, mainly occurring in net, <b>longlines,</b> and <b>fish</b> corrals. Usually, captured animals were released, although there is consumption of sea turtle meat and eggs by fishermen...|$|R

2500|$|The Tuvaluan economy {{therefore}} {{relies heavily}} on its fishing income, with 42% of the Tuvaluan population involved in fishing activity at various levels. UN Data calculated a gross value of fisheries at US$43,773,582 (2007 est), which accounted for the output of coastal commercial fishing, coastal subsistence fishing, locally based offshore fishing, foreign-based offshore fishing, freshwater fishing and aquaculture. In recent years [...] all of the income has been generated through the listed activities in Tuvalu waters, rather than through exports direct from Tuvalu. The activities of international fishing vessels, which in 2008 comprised 42 <b>longline</b> <b>fishing</b> vessels, 3 pole/line vessels and 126 purse seiners, far outweigh domestic activity, with a production volume of 35,541 tonnes worth US$40,924,370 (2009 est) or 93.5% of gross value, although Tuvalu retains a sizeable share in income via licensing. The fishing in the 900,000km2 of water area mainly consists of Skipjack Tuna, Yellowfin Tuna and Bigeye Tuna.|$|E

50|$|The WPRFMC {{incorporated}} {{these measures}} into a Pelagics FMP amendment in 2002, requiring that these seabird mitigation measures {{be used when}} fishing north of 23 deg N.

50|$|Salvation was at hand, however, for the shallow-set {{longline}} fishery, {{based on}} hook research by NMFS Fisheries Engineering Laboratory in Pascagoula, Mississippi. This research found that large 18/0 circle hooks combined with mackerel type fish bait could sharply reduce loggerhead and leatherback interactions of <b>longline</b> vessels <b>fishing</b> on the Grand Banks for swordfish. The WPRFMC operationalized this technology in an FMP amendment which established a limited Hawaii-based shallow-set swordfish fishery using circle hooks with mackerel bait.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} {{was carried out in}} February 1999 at South Georgia (Subarea 48. 3) {{to examine the effects of}} different weighting regimes on the incidental mortality of birds caught on <b>longlines</b> <b>fishing</b> for toothfish (Dissostichus spp.). Three regimes were examined, with weights of 4. 25, 8. 5 and 12. 75 kg attached at 40 m intervals on a Spanishrigged longline. There was a significant reduction in bird mortality when 8. 5 kg was used compared to 4. 25 kg, but no further significant reduction when 12. 75 kg was used. Therefore to minimise seabird by-catch, line-weighting regimes of at least 8. 5 kg at 40 m intervals should be used. Results suggested that seabird by-catch on lines using effective weighting regimes may be even further reduced where all lines being set in the vicinity use effective line-weighting regimes. The importance of a good design in experiments of this type is emphasised, because even though conditions may be held as constant as possible within experiments, the ability to separate treatment effects from other sources of variation (e. g. environmental factors) must be preserved...|$|R
40|$|Exploitation of {{fish stocks}} is {{dependent}} on effort, catchability, the selectivity of the gear used, and the fishermen's choice of time and place. A full-scale fishing experiment was conducted in February 1996 at the coast of Finnmark, Norway; involving a trawler, a longliner and a gillnetter. The objective was to investigate how the length distributions of the catches were influenced by the gear type and the fishermen's strategy in fishing operations. The target species was North-East Arctic cod (Gadus morhua) and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus). The study analyses relative selectivity of the gears during a week when the boats fished in a predestined area, and during a week when the skippers were allowed to fish as close to commercial operation as possible with regard to choice of fishing grounds and depths. Gillnet catches consisted almost solely of large cod. Trawl and <b>longline</b> <b>fished</b> similar length distributions of cod although the L 50 for cod was higher in long line than in trawl. The fishing strategy of the longliner increased the mean length of haddock {{in the second part}} of the experiment. Other length and species distributions were almost unaffected...|$|R
50|$|The {{population}} of waved albatrosses on the Galápagos {{is protected by}} national park personnel, and the island is also categorized as a World Heritage Site. But limited range, bycatch by <b>longline</b> <b>fishing,</b> disturbance via tourism, disease, {{and the effects of}} illegal fishing in the nearby waters place them in considerable jeopardy. <b>Longline</b> <b>fishing</b> in particular seems to be having a severe impact on the species, the conservation status of which was upgraded from near threatened to vulnerable by the IUCN in 2000. Despite there still being some 34,700 adult birds in 2001, their numbers have apparently started to decrease at an unknown rate more recently, probably due to <b>longline</b> <b>fishing</b> which also upsets the sex ratio (males being killed more frequently). As the current situation makes the population highly vulnerable to a catastrophic collapse to extinction, it was uplisted to critically endangered status in the 2007 IUCN Red List.|$|E
