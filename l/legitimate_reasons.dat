25|$|The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 {{requires}} {{employers to}} provide job-protected unpaid leave for certain {{family and medical}} reasons. <b>Legitimate</b> <b>reasons</b> include pregnancy, childbirth, adoption, foster care placement, and care for an ill family member. However, this legislation is limited: coverage is only extended for twelve weeks and for employees who have worked for at least twelve months at the same job. Short-term medical illness and routine medical checkups were not covered until the FMLA, and family members other than parents, spouses, and children are not covered. Some states have extended the definition of family on their own, and therefore extended the coverage of FMLA.|$|E

Aubrey Oxlade, {{the chairman of the board}} and one of the four board members who voted to ratify Barnes's selection, said that the batsman's indiscretions were [...] "childish things" [...] and [...] "not serious at all".

500|$|The {{disabling}} of the LinkNYC tablets' browsers had stoked {{fears about}} further {{restrictions on the}} Links. The Independent, a British newspaper, surveyed some homeless New Yorkers and found that while most of these homeless citizens used the kiosks for <b>legitimate</b> <b>reasons</b> (usually not to browse NSFW content), many of the interviewees were scared that LinkNYC may eventually charge money {{to use the internet}} via the Links, or that the kiosks may be demolished altogether. The Guardian, another British newspaper, came to a similar conclusion; one of the LinkNYC users they interviewed said that the Links are [...] "very helpful, but of course bad people messed it up for everyone.” In a press release, LinkNYC refuted fears that service would be paywalled or eliminated, though it did state that several improvements, including dimming the kiosks and lowering maximum volumes, were being implemented to reduce the kiosks' effect on the surrounding communities.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the ability}} to get the games at nearly zero cost, Wolfire Games {{estimate}} that 25% of the traceable downloads for the first Bundle have come from software piracy by links provided in some forums that bypass the payment screen to access the games; Wolfire further surmises additional piracy occurred through BitTorrent-type peer-to-peer sharing services. Rosen noted they purposely removed much of the DRM associated with games to appeal to those who would otherwise engage in software piracy, through both having the games ship without DRM and by having only limited copy protection on their website. Rosen also stated that for about ten users that emailed Wolfire about being unable to pay for the software, he personally donated on their behalf. Rosen comments that there may be <b>legitimate</b> <b>reasons</b> for those who appear to be pirating the game, including the inability to use the payment methods provided or that they had made a single large donation for multiple copies. Rosen also considered that there are players that would simply forward the download links to [...] "take pleasure in spreading the pirated links to their friends or anonymous buddies for fun". Wolfire Games did take action to stop predatory sites, such as the closely named [...] "wollfire.com", from selling illegal copies of the bundle.|$|E
2500|$|The School of Salamanca, which {{gathered}} theologians {{such as the}} Dominican Francisco de Vitoria (1480–1546), {{and later}} theologians, such as the highly influential Jesuit Francisco Suárez (1548–1617), argued {{in favor of the}} existence of rights to indigenous peoples. [...] For example, these theologians thought that it was illegitimate to conquer other peoples for religious reasons, or even to force the baptisms of non-Christian subjects. [...] Their views on non-believers had been already established by medieval discussions of Jewish and Muslim subjects of Christian princes. [...] Although this view was not always prevalent, it was the traditional Dominican and Thomist view, and reflected the practice of late antiquity and the early Middle Ages. However, while such theologians limited Charles V's imperial powers over colonized people, they also mentioned some <b>legitimate</b> <b>reasons</b> for the conquest. [...] For instance, on their view, war might be justified if the indigenous people refused free transit and commerce to the Europeans; if they forced converts to return to idolatry; if there come to be a sufficient number of Christians in the newly discovered land that they wish to receive from the Pope a Christian government; if the indigenous people lacked just laws, magistrates, agricultural techniques, etc. In any case, title taken according to this principle must be exercised with Christian charity, warned Suárez, and for the advantage of the Indians. More traditional theologians legitimized the conquest {{while at the same time}} limiting the absolute power of the sovereign, which was celebrated in others parts of Europe under the developing notion of the divine right of kings.|$|E
2500|$|Reinhardt {{then asked}} if [...] "the People of California have <b>legitimate</b> <b>reasons</b> for ... tak away from {{same-sex}} couples {{the right to}} have their lifelong partnerships dignified by the official status of 'marriage'." [...] Finding a close parallel concerning the removal of an existing right from a minority group without legitimate reason in the case of Romer v. Evans 634-635 (1996), in that it was based on the narrowest ground upon which the matter could be decided, he rejected each of the reasons offered as justifications for Proposition 8. [...] First, it had no effect on child-rearing since it made no change to laws governing parenting and adoption by either gender. Second, it would not affect the procreative behavior of opposite-sex couples. Similarly, it could not reflect a reasonable attempt to [...] "proceed with caution" [...] in altering social institutions because more than 18,000 same-sex couples had already married and because its intention was to create an absolute barrier embedded within the constitution (rather than a cautious restriction). Voters were told instead that the proposition would [...] "eliminate" [...] the right of same-sex couples to marry. [...] The law had just one effect, namely to strip a disfavored minority of an [...] "extraordinarily significan" [...] official designation - the name that society gives to the relationship that matters most between two adults. Stating that in law, the willful creation of a new legal status quo and withdrawal of the right to a designation with significant social consequences is very different from a mere declining to extend that designation to a group in the first place, he concluded that the [...] "inevitable inference" [...] was that Proposition 8's rationale was [...] "disapproval of gays and lesbians as a class", and agreed with its unconstitutionality: [...] "he People of California may not, consistent with the Federal Constitution, add to their state constitution a provision that has no more practical effect than to strip gays and lesbians of their right to use the official designation that the State and society give to committed relationships, thereby adversely affecting the status and dignity of the members of a disfavored class." ...|$|E

6000|$|What {{should be}} a man's or a woman's reason for taking {{literature}} as a vocation, what sort of success ought they to desire, what sort of ambition should possess them? These are natural questions, now that so many readers exist in the world, all asking for something new, now that so many writers are making their pens [...] "in running to devour the way" [...] over so many acres of foolscap. The <b>legitimate</b> <b>reasons</b> for enlisting (too often without receiving the shilling) in this army of writers are not far to seek. A man may be convinced that he has useful, or beautiful, or entertaining ideas within him, he may hold that he can express them in fresh and charming language. He may, in short, have a [...] "vocation," [...] or feel conscious of a vocation, which is {{not exactly the same}} thing. There are [...] "many thyrsus bearers, few mystics," [...] many are called, few chosen. Still, to be sensible of a vocation is something, nay, is much, for most of us drift without any particular aim or predominant purpose. Nobody can justly censure people whose chief interest is in letters, whose chief pleasure is in study or composition, who rejoice in a fine sentence as others do in a well modelled limb, or a delicately touched landscape, nobody can censure them for trying their fortunes in literature. Most of them will fail, for, as the bookseller's young man told an author once, they have the poetic temperament, without the poetic power. Still among these whom Pendennis has tempted, in boyhood, to run away from school to literature as Marryat has tempted others to run away to sea, there must be some who will succeed. But an early and intense ambition is not everything, any more than a capacity for taking pains is everything in literature or in any art.|$|E
