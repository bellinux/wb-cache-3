5|$|The MBTA begin soliciting {{bids for}} {{pre-construction}} site {{preparation for the}} station and the associated <b>layover</b> yard in June 2012. A $3.75 million contract was awarded and notice to proceed given on November 26, 2012. Site preparation work began in early December. Bidding on a nominally-$27.592 million contract for the primary station and <b>layover</b> yard construction opened in February 2013. Bids came in lower than expected; a $22.9 million contract was awarded on May 22, 2013, for construction {{to be completed by}} the end of 2014. Track and signal work and bridge repairs were placed in separate contracts.|$|E
5|$|Malacca was {{a six-hour}} <b>layover</b> on May 13, affording limited sightseeing. Kalākaua was given walking canes as souvenirs. Their {{one day at}} Penang on May 15 saw a visit by Governor John Frederick Adolphus McNair who hosted them at his {{residence}} of Suffolk House.|$|E
5|$|On February 17, 2010, the US Department of Transportation {{awarded a}} $55.5M TIGER grant for {{the station in}} West Fitchburg and a new <b>layover</b> {{facility}} {{in the town of}} Westminster. In June 2010, the MBTA and Pan Am Railways reached an agreement for trackage rights and fees on several lines, including MBTA access to Wachusett station and the <b>layover</b> on the Pan Am Southern mainline partially owned by Pan Am Railways. The project officially began with a publicized groundbreaking on October 18, 2010, and was originally scheduled to be completed by the first quarter of 2012. However, by February 2012, the station was just at 30% design phase, with track and signals to reach 30% design by late spring. As of then, the estimated completion date was October 2013.|$|E

5|$|The {{precursor}} to Hurricane Donna brought severe weather to the Dakar area of Senegal. Air France Flight AF343, which was flying from Paris, France to Abidjan, Ivory Coast, attempted {{to land at}} the Léopold Sédar Senghor International Airport as a <b>layover.</b> However, due to squally weather, the plane instead crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, killing all 63people on board. Heavy rainfall was also reported in Cape Verde on August30.|$|E
5|$|At a {{scheduled}} <b>layover</b> in Chicago, they disembarked {{only long enough}} for breakfast and to answer some brief media questions before the train resumed its route. In Omaha, Nebraska, the King was {{the guest of honor}} at a reception held in the home of Judge James M. Woolworth. Most of the attendees were friends of the judge's daughter, who had met the King on a vacation in Hawaii. Although Kalākaua had claimed exhaustion from his world trip, he nevertheless danced the whole night with the women guests. Claus and Mrs. Spreckels joined the group at Ogden, Utah.|$|E
5|$|Bounty {{had left}} England in 1787 {{on a mission}} to collect and {{transport}} breadfruit plants from Tahiti to the West Indies. A five-month <b>layover</b> in Tahiti, during which many of the men lived ashore and formed relationships with native Polynesians, proved harmful to discipline. Relations between Bligh and his crew deteriorated after he began handing out increasingly harsh punishments, criticism and abuse, Christian being a particular target. After three weeks back at sea, Christian and others forced Bligh from the ship. Twenty-five men remained on board afterwards, including loyalists held against their will and others for whom there was no room in the launch.|$|E

5|$|Grønlandsfly also {{purchased}} {{its first}} jet aircraft, a Boeing 757–200 which began operation in May 1998. The airliner was named Kunuunnguaq {{in honour of}} the Greenlandic explorer and ethnologist Knud Rasmussen, whose bust decorates in the terminal of Kangerlussuaq hub. The airliner allowed the company to run the profitable Kangerlussuaq–Copenhagen route directly, without affiliates or a <b>layover</b> in Iceland. Thus, in 1999, the airline served 282,000 passengers, nearly triple the number {{at the end of}} the previous decade.|$|E
5|$|Readville {{station is}} bounded by several {{railroad}} yards which were mostly {{built in the}} first half of the 20th century. East of the station on the Fairmount Line is the Readville Interim Repair Facility, an MBTA commuter rail maintenance facility and <b>layover</b> yard. Readville 1-Yard is an active CSX freight yard located south of the station, on tracks connecting the Fairmount Line to the Northeast Corridor. Additionally, there were formerly several yard tracks along the Northeast Corridor north of the station.|$|E
5|$|Returning from a Hong Kong {{business}} trip, Beth Emhoff (Gwyneth Paltrow) has a <b>layover</b> in Chicago to {{rendezvous with}} a former lover before returning to her family in suburban Minneapolis. She appears to have contracted a cold during her trip. Her six-year-old son from a previous marriage, Clark, also becomes symptomatic and is sent home from school. Beth's condition worsens and two days later she collapses with severe seizures. Her husband, Mitch (Matt Damon), rushes her to the hospital, but she dies of an unknown cause.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Persistent {{scatterer}} interferometry (PSI) typically rejects <b>layovers.</b> Therefore, layover-Affected {{urban areas}} may suffer from inadequate deformation sampling. SAR tomography, when {{used as an}} add-on to PSI, reveals additional deformation samples by resolving <b>layovers.</b> In this paper we quantify the relative gain in deformation sampling, while {{taking into account the}} quality of the additional (double) scatterers in terms of root-mean-square (RMS) phase deviation. We experiment on an interferometric stack of 50 TerraSAR-X stripmap images acquired over the city of Barcelona. The results show a tradeoff between the gain {{and the quality of the}} detected scatterers. For the observed urban area, we obtain a gain of 9. 8...|$|R
50|$|APUs are {{installed}} on some diesel locomotives, allowing the prime mover {{to be shut}} down during extended <b>layovers.</b> This provides power and heat to maintain air pressure, provide battery charging and prevent the prime mover coolant from freezing.|$|R
5|$|The {{northern}} portal, {{accessible to}} buses at street level from Olive Way, and from Interstate 5 via an express lane ramp, is Convention Place {{station at the}} intersection of 9th Avenue and Pine Street near the Washington State Convention Center. Convention Place is the only bus-exclusive station in the tunnel, and consists of four sheltered platforms in a sunken, open-air <b>layover</b> space below street level. Buses enter the tunnel under 9th Avenue, passing under the historic Camlin Hotel, before joining the University Link Tunnel used by light rail trains headed north for three blocks under Pine Street to Capitol Hill station.|$|E
5|$|The {{victims were}} gassed with diesel exhaust {{from the engine}} of a Red Army tank. SS-Scharführer Erich Fuchs was {{responsible}} for installing it. The engine was brought in by the SS {{at the time of}} the camp's construction and housed in a room with a generator that supplied the camp with electricity. The tank engine exhaust pipe ran just below the ground and opened into all three gas chambers. The fumes could be seen seeping out. After about 20 minutes the bodies were removed by dozens of Sonderkommandos, placed onto carts and wheeled away. The system was imperfect and required a lot of effort; trains that arrived later in the day had to wait on <b>layover</b> tracks overnight at Treblinka, Małkinia, or Wólka Okrąglik.|$|E
5|$|International District/Chinatown station, {{the southernmost}} tunnel station, is {{partially}} open-air and located immediately below a public plaza at Union Station. The station has connections to Amtrak and Sounder commuter rail at King Street Station a block to the west, accessible through the Weller Street Bridge, {{as well as}} the First Hill Streetcar on Jackson Street, stopping east of 5th Avenue South. Other attractions near the station include CenturyLink Field to the west and Uwajimaya a block to the southeast. South of the station, the light rail tracks, and bus lanes are separated by railway signals at an underground bus <b>layover</b> and staging area next to the tunnel comfort room for bus drivers. The southern portal of the tunnel is located under the intersection of Airport Way and 5th Avenue South at the western terminus of the Interstate 90 express lanes for high-occupancy vehicles. Light rail trains and southbound buses continue from the tunnel in separated lanes on the SODO Busway, while eastbound buses use a ramp that merges with the Interstate 90 express lanes that will be retrofitted for the East Link light rail service in 2023.|$|E

50|$|Mark IV {{hoped to}} redevelop the site with 1,000 rooms, but instead remodeled the {{property}} with a Greek theme and reopened {{it as the}} Greek Isles in 2001. The Greek Isles contracted with Delta Air Lines to house flight crews during <b>layovers.</b>|$|R
25|$|The primary heavy {{maintenance}} facility is the MBTA Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility, located in East Somerville {{on the former}} site of the Boston and Maine's Boston Engine Terminal. It is also used for midday and overnight storage of trains on the northside lines. Southampton Street Yard and the Readville Interim <b>Layover</b> facility are used for light maintenance and <b>layover</b> service. Various other <b>layover</b> facilities are used for midday and overnight storage; most are located near the outer ends of the lines.|$|E

50|$|Unrealistic scheduling: Many public {{transportation}} agencies are tax-subsidized, and therefore are often cash-strapped {{while attempting to}} maximize service provided to customers. In such cases, schedules that are written do not provide enough time for operators to travel along the route in the time allotted, and <b>layovers</b> are too short to allow enough recovery time, thereby seriously delaying the service on a regular basis.|$|R

25|$|The tracks {{continue}} south (compass west) {{beyond the}} station to the 34th Street station. These tracks formerly led to an unused storage and <b>layover</b> area, but {{the extension of the}} Flushing Line, whose trackwork was completed in 2013, included the addition of third rails to the <b>layover</b> tracks, as well as the inspection and replacement of these tracks. The closed lower level platform at 42nd Street–Port Authority Bus Terminal on the IND Eighth Avenue Line was blocking the line but since removed. Currently, all Flushing-bound service is on the eastbound track, labeled Track 2, and 34th Street-bound service is on the westbound track, labeled Track 1.|$|E
50|$|Through the World War II {{years the}} Norwich Police were very active. Train loads of German and Italian {{prisoners of war}} often stopped in Norwich, then a hub of the O&W {{railroad}} and the Erie Lackawanna Railroad. Norwich Police officers along with on board MPs guarded these trains during <b>layovers</b> in the City. Another war duty was escorting US Army convoys to and from Fort Drum, NY.|$|R
5000|$|When Forest Hills {{station was}} rebuilt in 1987, a loop for the [...] "E" [...] Branch was built {{as part of}} the station complex, so that Arborway would only be used for <b>layovers</b> and maintenance.

50|$|Long <b>layovers</b> and {{unpredictable}} travel plans re-created {{the demand for}} day rooms in modern times. In the United States, jobs that require travel became more popular in the 20th and 21st centuries. The practice of renting a hotel room for a day is also common among travelers and vacationers who go on cruises, {{due to the fact}} that cruise ships typically depart and arrive at early hours of the morning.|$|R
