25|$|Different {{authors have}} {{interpreted}} the TCP/IP model differently, and disagree whether the <b>link</b> <b>layer,</b> or the entire TCP/IP model, covers OSI layer 1 (physical layer) issues, or whether a hardware layer is assumed below the <b>link</b> <b>layer.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>link</b> <b>layer</b> {{is used to}} move packets {{between the}} Internet layer {{interfaces}} of two different hosts on the same link. The processes of transmitting and receiving packets on a given link can be controlled both in the software device driver for the network card, {{as well as on}} firmware or specialized chipsets. These perform data link functions such as adding a packet header to prepare it for transmission, then actually transmit the frame over a physical medium. The TCP/IP model includes specifications of translating the network addressing methods used in the Internet Protocol to <b>link</b> <b>layer</b> addresses, such as Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. All other aspects below that level, however, are implicitly assumed to exist in the <b>link</b> <b>layer,</b> but are not explicitly defined.|$|E
25|$|The TCP/IP model's <b>link</b> <b>layer</b> {{corresponds}} to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model physical and data link layers, layers one {{and two of the}} OSI model.|$|E

For the physical and <b>link</b> <b>layers</b> we use a commercial chip-set. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays on the PCI Pamette and a secondary FireLink board are used to implement a simple transaction <b>layer</b> interfacing the <b>link</b> <b>layers</b> to the host CPU. ...|$|R
25|$|This is {{also the}} layer where packets may be {{selected}} to be sent over a virtual private network or other networking tunnel. In this scenario, the <b>link</b> <b>layer</b> data may be considered application data which traverses another instantiation of the IP stack for transmission or reception over another IP connection. Such a connection, or virtual link, may be established with a transport protocol or even an application scope protocol {{that serves as a}} tunnel in the <b>link</b> <b>layer</b> of the protocol stack. Thus, the TCP/IP model does not dictate a strict hierarchical encapsulation sequence.|$|E
25|$|The <b>link</b> <b>layer</b> {{defines the}} {{networking}} methods {{within the scope}} of the local network link on which hosts communicate without intervening routers. This layer includes the protocols used to describe the local network topology and the interfaces needed to effect transmission of Internet layer datagrams to next-neighbor hosts.|$|E
25|$|As an example, the goodput or data {{transfer}} rate of a V.92 voiceband modem {{is affected by the}} modem physical layer and data <b>link</b> <b>layer</b> protocols. It is sometimes higher than the physical layer data rate due to V.44 data compression, and sometimes lower due to bit-errors and automatic repeat request retransmissions.|$|E

25|$|Several {{authors have}} {{attempted}} to incorporate the OSI model's layers 1 and 2 into the TCP/IP model, since these are commonly referred to in modern standards (for example, by IEEE and ITU). This often results in a model with five layers, where the <b>link</b> <b>layer</b> or network access layer is split into the OSI model's layers 1 and 2.|$|E
25|$|The Ethernet {{physical}} layer is the {{physical layer}} {{component of the}} Ethernet family of computer network standards which defines the electrical or optical properties of the physical connection between a device and the network or between network devices. It is complemented by the MAC layer and the logical <b>link</b> <b>layer</b> which provide features like framing, addressing, checksums, virtual LANs, and link aggregation.|$|E
25|$|From an OSI model {{protocol}} stack viewpoint, the technologies used on DAB inhabit the following layers: the audio codec inhabits the presentation layer. Below {{that is the}} data <b>link</b> <b>layer,</b> in charge of statistical time division multiplexing and frame synchronization. Finally, the physical layer contains the error-correction coding, OFDM modulation, {{and dealing with the}} over-the-air transmission and reception of data. Some aspects of these are described below.|$|E

30|$|It {{should be}} noticed that this metric {{integrates}} all physical and <b>link</b> <b>layers</b> parameters, {{so that we}} can use this metric to analyze the joint PHY/MAC efficiency.|$|R
25|$|The {{ethernet}} is {{a family}} of frame-based computer networking technologies for local area networks (LANs). The name comes from the physical concept of the ether. It defines a number of wiring and signaling standards for the Physical Layer of the OSI networking model, through means of network access at the Media Access Control (MAC)/Data <b>Link</b> <b>Layer,</b> and a common addressing format. Robert Metcalfe, while at Xerox invented the ethernet in 1975.|$|E
25|$|Microcontroller {{firmware}} in {{the network}} adapter typically handles link issues, supported by driver software in the operating system. Non-programmable analog and digital electronics are normally {{in charge of the}} physical components below the <b>link</b> <b>layer,</b> typically using an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chipset for each network interface or other physical standard. High-performance routers are to a large extent based on fast non-programmable digital electronics, carrying out link level switching.|$|E
25|$|Spanning {{trees are}} {{important}} in parallel and distributed computing, {{as a way of}} maintaining communications between a set of processors; see for instance the Spanning Tree Protocol used by OSI <b>link</b> <b>layer</b> devices or the Shout (protocol) for distributed computing. However, the depth-first and breadth-first methods for constructing spanning trees on sequential computers are not well suited for parallel and distributed computers. Instead, researchers have devised several more specialized algorithms for finding spanning trees in these models of computation.|$|E
30|$|Smart city systems rely {{on various}} {{heterogeneous}} networking protocols at {{the physical and}} data <b>link</b> <b>layers,</b> which use different medium access control (MAC) strategies Interoperability between these protocols is important {{in order to provide}} seamless integration of the underlying technologies. The IEEE 1905.1 protocol, which was designed to provide convergent interface between physical/data <b>link</b> <b>layers</b> and the network layer is intended to play such a role for digital home networks [28]. Development of similar protocols to expand the support mechanism for smart city systems is a good area for future research.|$|R

25|$|The term throughput, {{essentially}} {{the same thing as}} digital bandwidth consumption, denotes the achieved average useful bit rate in a computer network over a logical or physical communication link or through a network node, typically measured at a reference point above the datalink layer. This implies that the throughput often excludes data <b>link</b> <b>layer</b> protocol overhead. The throughput is affected by the traffic load from the data source in question, as well as from other sources sharing the same network resources. See also measuring network throughput.|$|E
25|$|The Internet {{protocol}} suite provides end-to-end data communication specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received. This functionality is organized into four abstraction layers which classify all related protocols {{according to the}} scope of networking involved. From lowest to highest, the layers are the <b>link</b> <b>layer,</b> containing communication methods for data that remains within a single network segment (link); the internet layer, providing internetworking between independent networks; the transport layer handling host-to-host communication; and the application layer, which provides process-to-process data exchange for applications.|$|E
25|$|Underlying these layers are the {{networking}} {{technologies that}} interconnect networks at their borders and exchange traffic across them. The Internet layer enables computers {{to identify and}} locate each other via Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, and routes their traffic via intermediate (transit) networks. Last, {{at the bottom of}} the architecture is the <b>link</b> <b>layer,</b> which provides logical connectivity between hosts on the same network link, such as a local area network (LAN) or a dial-up connection. The model, also known as TCP/IP, is designed to be independent of the underlying hardware used for the physical connections, which the model does not concern itself with in any detail. Other models have been developed, such as the OSI model, that attempt to be comprehensive in every aspect of communications. While many similarities exist between the models, they are not compatible in the details of description or implementation. Yet, TCP/IP protocols are usually included in the discussion of OSI networking.|$|E

25|$|OSPF {{does not}} use a {{transport}} protocol, such as UDP or TCP, but encapsulates its data directly in IP packets with protocol number 89. This {{is in contrast to}} other routing protocols, such as the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). OSPF implements its own transport layer error detection and correction functions. OSPF uses multicast addressing for distributing route information within a broadcast domain. OSPF reserves the multicast addresses 224.0.0.5 (IPv4) and FF02::5 (IPv6) for all SPF/link state routers (AllSPFRouters) and 224.0.0.6 (IPv4) and FF02::6 (IPv6) for all Designated Routers (AllDRouters). For non-broadcast networks, special provisions for configuration facilitate neighbor discovery. OSPF multicast IP packets never traverse IP routers, they never travel more than one hop. The virtual link feature can be used to create an adjacency tunnel across multiple hops. The OSPF protocols gathers information regarding all link states in the domain in its link state database, and is thus not a <b>link</b> <b>layer</b> protocol itself, but is – based on the purpose of the protocol; to exchange and calculate optimal paths through the network for IP destination addresses – most correctly classified as an Internet layer protocol. The OSPF protocol, when running on IPv4, can operate securely between routers, optionally using a variety of authentication methods to allow only trusted routers to participate in routing. OSPFv3, running on IPv6, does not support protocol-internal authentication. Instead, it relies on IPv6 protocol security (IPsec).|$|E

2500|$|The <b>link</b> <b>layer</b> has [...] the {{networking}} {{scope of}} the local network connection to which a host is attached. This regime is called the link in TCP/IP literature. It is the lowest component layer of the Internet protocols, as TCP/IP {{is designed to be}} hardware independent. As a result, TCP/IP may be implemented on top of virtually any hardware networking technology.|$|E
40|$|Wireless {{local area}} {{networks}} experience performance degradation in presence of small packets. The {{main reason for}} that is the large overhead added at the physical and <b>link</b> <b>layers.</b> This paper proposes a concatenation algorithm which groups IP layer packets prior to transmission, called PAC-IP. As a result, the overhead added at the physical and the <b>link</b> <b>layers</b> is shared among the grouped packets. Along with performance improvement, PAC-IP enables packet-based fairness in medium access as well as includes QoS support module handling delay-sensitive trafﬁc demands. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through both simulations and an experimental WLAN testbed environment covering the single-hop and the widespread infrastructure network scenarios. Obtained results underline signiﬁcant performance enhancement in different operating scenarios and channel conditions...|$|R
50|$|Frame Relay is a {{standardized}} {{wide area network}} technology that specifies the physical and data <b>link</b> <b>layers</b> of digital telecommunications channels using a packet switching methodology.

30|$|More recently, {{vehicular}} delay-tolerant networks (VDTNs) were {{proposed as}} an alternative network architecture for sparse vehicular networks [24]. VDTN architecture also adopts a store-carry-and-forward paradigm from DTNs. Nonetheless, it distinguishes itself from the DTN architecture by positioning the bundle layer between the network and data <b>link</b> <b>layers,</b> introducing a clear separation between control and data planes using out-of-band signaling.|$|R
