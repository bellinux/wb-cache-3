The sputter coated fabric has a greater value in reflectance and lightness than metallic powder printed fabric, but is lower than that of metallic foil <b>laminated</b> <b>fabric.</b> The values of surface geometrical smoothness (SMD) increased after metallic powder printing while decreasing slightly after sputter coating and decreasing significantly after metallic foil lamination.

40|$|One form of waterproof, {{breathable}} apparel is manufactured from polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane <b>laminated</b> <b>fabric</b> using {{a specific}} process to seal seams {{that have been}} sewn with traditional techniques. The sealing process involves applying waterproof tape to the seam by feeding the seam through two rollers while applying hot air (600 20 C). This study addressed the potential for exposure to particulate matter from this sealing process by characterizing airborne particles in a facility that produces more than 1000 lightweight PTFE rain jackets per day. Aerosol concentrations throughout the facility were mapped, breathing zone concentrations were measured, and hoods used to ventilate the seam sealing operation were evaluated. The geometric mean (GM) particle number concentrations were substantially greater in the sewing and sealing areas (67, 000 and 188, 000 particles cm 2 ? 23)) compared with that measured in the office area (12, 100 particles cm 2 ? 23). Respirable mass concentrations were negligible throughout the facility (GM = 0. 002 mg m 2 ? 23) in the sewing and sealing areas). The particles exiting the final discharge of the facility's ventilation system were dominated by nanoparticles (number median diameter = 25 nm; geometric standard deviation of 1. 39). The breathing zone particle number concentrations of the workers who sealed the sewn seams were highly variable and significantly greater when sealing seams than when conducting other tasks (p < 0. 0001). The sealing workers' breathing zone concentrations ranged from 147, 000 particles cm 2 ? 23 to 798, 000 particles cm 2 ? 23, and their seam responsibility significantly influenced their breathing zone concentrations (p = 0. 03). The finding that particle number concentrations were approximately equal outside the hood and inside the local exhaust duct indicated poor effectiveness of the canopy hoods used to ventilate sealing operations.

40|$|This work strived to {{increase}} knowledge of assessing airborne nanoparticles {{in the workplace}} by characterizing nanoparticle concentrations in a workplace using direct-reading instruments, evaluating a DC 2000 CE diffusion charger, {{and the creation of}} a personal diffusion battery (pDB). Direct-reading instruments were used with aerosol mapping and task monitoring to evaluate airborne nanoparticle concentrations in an apparel company that produces waterproof jackets composed of polytetrafluoroethylene membrane <b>laminated</b> <b>fabric.</b> Jacket production required that sewn seams be sealed with waterproof tape applied with hot air (600 °C). Particle number concentrations were greater in the sewing and sealing areas than the office area while respirable mass was negligible throughout the facility. The breathing zone particle number concentrations of the workers who sealed the sewn seams were highly variable and significantly greater when sealing seams than when conducting other tasks (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001). The effectiveness of the canopy hoods used to ventilate sealing operations was poor. These measurements support the idea that work places were hot processes are conducted may have substantially greater concentrations of airborne nanoparticles than background measurements even with control measures in place. Laboratory tests were conducted to evaluate a commercially available diffusion charger, the DC 2000 CE, that measures nanoparticle surface area concentration. The surface area concentrations of unimodal and multimodal polydispersed aerosols measured by the DC 2000 CE were less than the surface area concentrations measured by the reference instruments. The differences in results were attributed to a difference of measuring active versus geometric surface area concentration and the design of the DC 2000 CE. The maximum measurable active surface area concentration (2, 500 mm 2 m- 3) was found to be greater than the manufacturer stated maximum (1000 mm 2 m- 3). Moving or vibrating a DC 2000 CE while taking measurements can cause the appearance of increased surface area concentration results. The DC 2000 CE has limitations that must be acknowledged when using the DC 2000 CE to measure airborne nanoparticle surface area concentrations in a workplace. A four stage pDB (3. 2 kg) composed of a screen-type diffusion battery, solenoid valve system, and an electronic controller was developed. The pDB was combined with a CPC and a data inversion was created that could be used to solve for the number median diameter, geometric standard deviation, and particle number concentration of a unimodal distribution. The pDB+CPC with inversion was evaluated using unimodal propylene torch exhaust and incense exhaust. For particle number concentration of particles with diameters less than 100 nm, the pDB+CPC with inversion results were between 86...|$|E
40|$|The Precambrian-Cambrian Athel Silicilyte is {{an enigmatic}} chert unit {{of up to}} 390 m thick found as slabs (each slab {{typically}} 2 × 6 km across) entrapped within salt domes {{at a depth of}} 4 - 5 km in the South Oman Salt Basin. This formation is a prolific self-charged reservoir with high porosity (up to 34 %) and high oil saturation (80 %). Despite its economic value, the origin and the variability of this formation are not fully understood. This study therefore aims to investigate the variability and the origin (silica source and precipitation mechanism) of the Athel Silicilyte. Data obtained from core, wireline log and petrographical analysis were employed to establish the vertical and the lateral variability and, with the assistance of geochemical data, the likely source and precipitation mechanism of silica was determined. The Athel Silicilyte is only present in the deepest parts of the South Oman Salt Basin within the fault-bounded Athel Basin, bounded by two silt-rich mudstone units. Six lithofacies were recognised in the Athel Silicilyte that reflect variability in detrital material contents (three silica-rich facies), sediment remobilisation (slumped and brecciated lithofacies) and diagenetic modification (carbonate-bearing lithofacies), with the silica-rich facies being the most abundant (> 97 % of the total thickness). The Athel Silicilyte exhibits wavy discontinuous lamination and it is predominately (silica-rich facies average = 80 wt. %) composed of connected-networks of microcrystalline quartz (1 - 5 µm). Other constituent components are detrital quartz (3 wt. %), illite (10 wt. %), pyrite (4 wt. %) and organic carbon (TOC = 3 wt. %). The detrital contents increase towards the Upper Athel Silicilyte and towards the basin margins (ranging from 3 to 30 wt. %). The wavy laminations are interpreted to have a microbial origin. The homogeneity, loose packing of detrital grains and preservation of 390 m thick <b>laminated</b> <b>fabric</b> suggest that the Athel Silicilyte precipitated syndepositionally in microbial layers during low detrital input. The intense detrital input during bounding mudstones sedimentation inhibited Athel Silicilyte precipitation {{as a result of the}} rapid burial of microbial layers. The Athel Silicilyte shows strong enrichments of redox-sensitive elements (U, V and Mo), Mn-depletion, positive Ce anomalies, and small framboidal pyrites (3. 6 - 4. 0 µm), suggesting that the water column was euxinic during precipitation. Based on the petrographical evidence for the Athel Silicilyte forming as a syndepositional precipitate alongside seawater-like rare earth element (REE) characteristics, silica is interpreted to have been sourced directly from seawater. Mass balance calculations support this interpretation, indicating that silica-rich Precambrian seawater provided the significant silica mass in the Athel Silicilyte. The ability of dissolved silica to form hydrogen bonds with the functional groups (e. g. carboxyl and hydroxyl) in microbial layers was the key for Athel Silicilyte precipitation. The formation of hydrogen bonds was made possible under euxinic conditions, where the pH values were probably lower (< 7) than for the normal seawater as a result of HS- and H+ production by sulphate reducing bacteria and HS- oxidation at the redox boundary by sulphur oxidising bacteria. Consequently, dissolved silica was concentrated in microbial layer microenvironemnts, resulting in silica nucleation and polymerisation.
