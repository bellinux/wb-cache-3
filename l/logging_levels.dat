30|$|The first Repast Simphony data {{collection}} system was built upon Log 4 J (LOG 4 J – Logging Services). Although Log 4 J {{is a widely}} used for fast, minimal overhead logging, adapting it {{to the requirements of}} Repast Simphony’s {{data collection}} functionality proved to be problematic. Log 4 J was difficult to adapt to the time-stamped and time-phased nature of Repast Simphony data collection. Log 4 J has no real user-facing mechanism for repeated initialization and termination from within a single application instance. Our incremental understanding of these requirements and adapting them to Log 4 J’s system of <b>logging</b> <b>levels</b> and logging messages resulted in code that was inflexible and hard to manage. The isolation available in the multilayered Repast Simphony logging system made it easier for the Repast development team to transition from Log 4 J to custom code while largely maintaining backward compatibility.|$|E
40|$|Throughout {{the last}} century, {{thousands}} of organizationsand individuals {{have been working}} to protect ancientand native forests, stop corporate subsidies on public lands, and protect our rivers and streams. The combination of their vigilance and a century of over-cutting have resulted in substantial declines in <b>logging</b> <b>levels</b> and stronger protections on our national forests. The work, however, is far from over. Some would say it has only just begun. The aftermath of nearly a century of logging, grazing, and mining has left today’s generation with a difficult legacy: more than 400, 000 miles of logging roads, {{millions of acres of}} clear-cuts, and a drastic decline in native biodiversity. In an effort to maintain timber harvest levels and generate public support for logging, land managers have employed “restoration ” treatments to public lands. But these techniques, although sometimes creating the appearance of a mature forest, fail to protect ecological processes and therefore, the life that depends upon them. Jim Coefield photo.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{document}} is to help developers of Grid middleware and application software generate log files that will be useful to Grid administrators, users, developers and Grid middleware itself. Currently, most of the currently generated log files are only useful to {{the author of the}} program. Good logging practices are instrumental to performance analysis, problem diagnosis, and security auditing tasks such as incident tracing and damage assessment. This document does not discuss the issue of a logging API. It is assumed that a standard log API such as syslog (C), log 4 j (Java), or logger (Python) is being used. Other custom logging API or even printf could be used. The key point is that the logs must contain the required information in the required format. At a high level of abstraction, the best practices for Grid logging are: (1) Consistently structured, typed, log events; (2) A standard high-resolution timestamp; (3) Use of <b>logging</b> <b>levels</b> and categories to separate logs by detail and purpose; (4) Consistent use of global and local identifiers; and (5) Use of some regular, newline-delimited ASCII text format.

30|$|Results {{from this}} study show that marked over-prediction of ρg and MOE {{occurred}} when constant ρg values of 1, 000 kg m− 3 were assumed. At the <b>log</b> <b>level</b> the most accurate predictions of ρg were obtained using a mixed-effects model that included fixed effects to account for mean longitudinal variation in ρg and random effects to account for deviations in this longitudinal variation between trees. Using this mixed effects model, <b>log</b> <b>level</b> Da for ρg and MOE averaged 0.189 %.

However, a number of factors-including a lack of information on the forest resources under consideration, uncertainties as to the stability of property rights over time, and a lack of access to credit-have limited the use of auctions so far, particularly in low-income countries. To establish transparency of the forestry sector''s financial flows, this paper discusses a radical simplification of Liberia''s current timber tax structure, including a proposal to reduce the sector''s current tax system to two instruments, an area tax and an export tax.

40|$|CIVINSA {{method is}} {{developed}} for determining how to implement sensors and data fusion systems for shipboard use in new or backfit warship designs. The underlying goal of proper implementation of new automation systems {{is to improve}} the operational readiness of the ship while simultaneously reducing crew size and operating costs. The thesis entails defining the method and then using it to determine the information requirements for the efficient implementation of automation technology into ship systems at multiple levels, with a primary focus at the platform level (where the operator interface resides). This includes categorizing the types of information (operational, casualty, combat, logistic, etc) and developing a schema by which each type of information is further defined and presented as an aid to the human operator. Raw sensor data {{is not the same as}} information in this context, rather information is the result of processing and analyzing raw sensor data. Information discriminators include refresh rates, frequency and extent of backup/historical <b>logging,</b> <b>levels</b> of data access, levels of automation control, levels of diagnostic and prognostic aids, and types of displays. A proposed machinery Health Monitoring System (HMS) for Gas Turbine Generators (GTG) for the current and future U. S. Navy Destroyers is examined as a case study to demonstrate the applicability of the implementation method developed in the thesis. Information requirements to support situational awareness for effective and efficient operator performance in a reduced crew environment are identified for the HMS. The required information is based on realistic shipboard scenarios, technical publications and expert interviews relating to the GTGs. Estimates of possible reductions of crew size from implementing the machinery HMS and the resultant costs and benefits of the technology over the life of the ship are analyzed. CIVIN...|$|E
40|$|In the Congo Basin {{where most}} timber species are light-demanding, the low logging intensities {{commonly}} implemented (1 - 2 trees harvested ha? 1) {{do not provide}} sufficient canopy gaps to ensure species regeneration. The regeneration of light-demanding timber species may therefore benefit from more intensive logging, or from post-harvest treatments such as thinning by poison girdling that increases light penetration. Little is known {{of the impact of}} post-harvest treatments on the floristic composition of tropical moist forests. This study therefore aimed to assess the effects of low and high selective logging (? 2. 33 and 4. 73 trees harvested ha? 1, and ? 4. 96 and 9. 16 m 2 ha? 1 of basal area removed (logging + damage), respectively) - followed or not by thinning (? 21. 14 trees thinned ha? 1, and ? 6. 57 m 2 ha? 1 of basal area removed) - on the floristic composition of a tropical moist forest in the Central African Republic, from 7 to 23 years after logging. We analyzed abundance data for 110 tree genera recorded every year for 14 years in 25 one-hectare permanent subplots. We used multivariate analysis to detect floristic variations between treatments and we assessed changes in floristic composition throughout the period. We compared floristic composition recovery between thinned and unthinned subplots, using unlogged subplots as a reference characterizing the pre-logging floristic composition. Logging and thinning had little impact on the floristic composition of the subplots as quantified 7 to 23 years later, though they did increase the proportion of pioneer species. Surprisingly, additional thinning at both <b>logging</b> <b>levels</b> failed to further distance floristic composition from that of the unlogged subplots, though it did increase disturbance intensity. Floristic composition recovery appeared to be facilitated when thinning was associated with logging. Thinning seemed to favor the growth and survival of non-pioneer species, to the detriment of pioneer species. These non-pioneer species could either be non-pioneer light demanders or shade-bearers. One explanation for this is that thinning by tree-poison girdling increased light availability without causing major damage to the forest, and thus increased the growth and survival of advance regeneration. The resulting enhanced competition then reduced the survival of pioneer species. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

40|$|The {{properties}} of Norwegian timber varies greatly, but no quality sorting is done before the logs are sawn to boards at the sawmills. This means that {{large amounts of}} timber with wide variation in quality pass through the grading system, resulting in a smaller yield in the higher strength classes. The requirements for structural timber are getting higher due to stricter safety margins in new standards. Still, forest owners are only rewarded by the volume the timber contains, and not based upon {{the strength of the}} timber. Thus, forest owners don't focus on which strength classes the timber belongs to during harvesting which causes a grading loss in higher strength classes. To meet the requirements from producers and customers, a more correct description of the timber is of importance. To achieve this, an earlier sorting and a more precise prediction of the wood properties is necessary. In this study, the timber properties are predicted by forest inventory data to investigate the potential of presorting by the use of variable at site, tree and <b>log</b> <b>level.</b> Density, modulus of elasticity (MOE) and modulus of rupture (MOR) were measured on 1206 boards from 205 Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) trees, sampled from 14 sites in south-eastern Norway. The variability of the properties was analyzed in linear mixed models where the random variance was divided into site variance, tree variance and residual variance. Variables at stand <b>level,</b> tree <b>level,</b> <b>log</b> <b>level</b> and board level were treated as fixed effects, and added as covariates to the model. For density, relative log height in tree (Hrel), expressed as the ratio of the position of one log to the total tree height, was the most important fixed effect, and density increased with increasing relative log height. For MOE, both the H/D-ratio, defined as the ratio of tree height to DBH of each selected tree, DBH and the interaction between Hrel and DBH were important fixed effects. MOE increased with increasing H/D-ratio and interaction between Hrel and DBH, while it decreased with increasing DBH. For MOR, DBH was the most important fixed effect, and MOR decreased with increasing DBH. Variance due to site accounts for a smaller proportion of the total variance in MOE and MOR than in density, while the within-tree variance accounts for a larger proportion of the variance in MOE and MOR than in density. Density is better explained than MOE and MOR at stand level, while this difference is much smaller, and partly opposite when also tree and log variables are included. This is probably because the density varies quite a lot at stand level, while MOE and MOR are also influenced by knots and other defects which may vary between trees and within trees. Since the strength properties are explained differently on stand, tree and <b>log</b> <b>level,</b> this means that the potential for sorting at different levels are not equal for density, MOE and MOR. For density, variables at stand, tree and <b>log</b> <b>level</b> reduced the site and tree variance {{to a greater extent than}} IP-value from Dynagrade. For MOE and MOR, variables at stand, tree and <b>log</b> <b>level</b> alone did not reduce the site and tree variance to a greater extent than IP-value, but the contribution from these variables improved the grading in combination with Dynagrade. Presorting using forest inventory data has the potential of improving the grading yield, but an implementation in the forest industry will require great effort and a desire from the entire value chain to be feasible.
