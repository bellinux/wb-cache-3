5|$|Eleven {{species of}} {{reptiles}} and four species of amphibians {{have been found}} in the park. Reptiles include the Great Basin rattlesnake, short-horned <b>lizard,</b> side-blotched <b>lizard,</b> striped whipsnake, and the tiger salamander.|$|E
5|$|Peter {{suspects}} Connors is the <b>Lizard</b> and unsuccessfully {{confronts the}} creature in the sewers. The <b>Lizard</b> learns Spider-Man's real identity via {{the name on}} an abandoned camera and follows Peter to school, where they fight. Police start a manhunt for both Spider-Man and the <b>Lizard.</b> The Police corner Spider-Man by taking off his mask and Captain Stacy discovers that Spider-Man is really Peter. The <b>Lizard</b> plans to make all humans lizard-like by releasing a chemical cloud from Oscorp's tower, to eliminate the weaknesses he believes plague humanity. Spider-Man eventually disperses an antidote cloud instead, restoring Connors and earlier victims to normal, but not before the <b>Lizard</b> mortally wounds Captain Stacy. Before his death, Captain Stacy requests Peter avoid Gwen, {{in order to keep}} her safe. Peter initially does so, but later at school, suggests to Gwen he may see her after all.|$|E

5|$|The {{remains of}} a <b>lizard</b> in the German specimen's {{thoracic}} cavity show that Compsognathus preyed on small vertebrates. Marsh, who examined the specimen in 1881, thought that this small skeleton in the Compsognathus belly was an embryo, but in 1903, Franz Nopcsa concluded {{that it was a}} <b>lizard.</b> Ostrom identified the remains as belonging to a <b>lizard</b> of the genus Bavarisaurus, which he concluded was a fast and agile runner owing to its long tail and limb proportions. This in turn led to the conclusion that its predators, Compsognathus, must have had sharp vision and the ability to rapidly accelerate and outrun the <b>lizard.</b> The Bavarisaurus is in a single piece, indicating that the Compsognathus must have swallowed its prey whole. The French specimen's gastric contents consist of unidentified lizards or sphenodontids.|$|E

5|$|Going {{higher in}} elevation, the {{coniferous}} forests become purer stands of red fir, western white pine, Jeffrey pine, lodgepole pine, {{and the occasional}} foxtail pine. Fewer wildlife species tend {{to be found in}} these habitats, because of their higher elevation and lower complexity. Species likely to be found include golden-mantled ground squirrel, chickaree, fisher, Steller's jay, hermit thrush, and northern goshawk. Reptiles are not common, but include rubber boa, western fence <b>lizard,</b> and northern alligator <b>lizard.</b>|$|E
50|$|Corytophanidae is {{a family}} of iguanian <b>lizards,</b> also called casquehead <b>lizards</b> or helmeted <b>lizards,</b> endemic to the New World. Nine species of casquehead <b>lizards</b> from three genera are recognized.|$|R

5|$|The babies {{discover}} a tiny <b>lizard</b> in Tommy Pickles' backyard {{that they are}} convinced is the offspring of Reptar, a fictitious green dinosaur and main character of many action movies of which the Rugrats are fond. After learning about the extinction of the dinosaurs, Tommy decides to return the <b>lizard</b> to Reptar just as his family has purchased tickets for a musical ice show based on the character. After Tommy's parents and grandfather have fallen asleep, the babies sneak into the ice rink and present the <b>lizard</b> to Leo, the actor portraying Reptar, who coincidentally happens to possess a phobia of lizards. Stu Pickles, Tommy's father, sees the rugrats and must retrieve them from the ice rink.|$|E

40|$|Host-parasite {{relationships}} {{are one of}} the most common symbiotic relationships present in a diverse array of ecosystems. There are numerous factors that impact the dynamics of these relationships. Major factors that can influence the degree of parasitism include host sex, hormonal state, reproductive condition, and behavior. It has been observed in several vertebrate taxa that males have higher ectoparasite intensities than females and males with increased testosterone have increased ectoparasite intensities. One potential reason for these observations is that testosterone concentrations are elevated in males, particularly during the breeding season, and when circulating concentrations increase males become more vulnerable to ectoparasitism. Here I first tested the hypothesis that higher circulating testosterone concentrations in male western fence <b>lizards</b> (Sceloporus occidentalis) induce higher tick intensities. To examine this hypothesis I implanted male <b>lizards</b> with either testosterone or blank implants in the field. The testosterone-implanted males had significantly higher tick intensities compared to the control males. However, in contrast, control males had significantly higher mite intensities compared to testosterone-implanted males. These results are consistent with other studies suggesting that testosterone impacts certain aspects of host-parasite relationships. However, the exact mechanism for how testosterone influences parasite intensities remains unclear. There are two major current hypotheses for how testosterone influences ectoparasite intensities on males, the first involving immunosuppression and the second involving behavioral patterns and movement. However, another potential reason for why male <b>lizards,</b> particularly those with high circulating testosterone, have higher ectoparasite intensities than female and low testosterone male <b>lizards</b> is that the parasites preferentially choose their host. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that vitellogenic female <b>lizards</b> have diminished immune function and this could potentially lead to increased ectoparasitism in much the same way that testosterone does in male <b>lizards.</b> Therefore, it is possible that a host preference is also present with vitellogenic versus non-vitellogenic female <b>lizards.</b> Although there have been a few interspecific studies done on this topic there have been no such studies on parasite host preference in reptiles to date. Here I tested three hypotheses: 1. Ticks prefer male <b>lizards</b> to female <b>lizards.</b> 2. Ticks prefer male <b>lizards</b> with high testosterone concentrations to male <b>lizards</b> with normal testosterone concentrations. 3. Ticks prefer vitellogenic female <b>lizards</b> to non-vitellogenic female <b>lizards.</b> All three experiments demonstrated no preference of host by ticks, which suggests they will attach to any suitable host they come across. However, during the male versus female host choice experiment ticks fed faster on vitellogenic female <b>lizards</b> than male <b>lizards</b> and non-vitellogenic female <b>lizards.</b> These results, taken together with previous studies showing higher tick intensities on male <b>lizards,</b> <b>lizards</b> with experimentally elevated testosterone, and reproductive female <b>lizards,</b> provide evidence that ticks do not preferentially choose their host, but instead are found in higher numbers on certain hosts due to some other reason. Other potential explanations include differences in immune function, microhabitat use, and behavioral patterns. One of the major hypotheses as to why male <b>lizards,</b> particularly those with high testosterone concentrations, have higher ectoparasite intensities than female <b>lizards</b> and male <b>lizards</b> with low testosterone concentrations is that these <b>lizards</b> perform more territorial behaviors, have increased movements, and larger home range sizes, thus exposing them to more parasites. Several studies have shown testosterone to increase the frequency of behaviors, movement, and home range size in <b>lizards,</b> but few, if any, have related it to ectoparasite intensities. Here I tested two hypotheses: 1. High testosterone male <b>lizards</b> have larger home ranges than male <b>lizards</b> with lower testosterone concentrations and female <b>lizards.</b> 2. High testosterone male <b>lizards</b> perform a higher frequency of territorial behaviors than male <b>lizards</b> with lower testosterone concentrations and female <b>lizards.</b> To test these hypotheses I implanted male <b>lizards</b> with either testosterone or blank-control implants, left female <b>lizards</b> unaltered, and performed behavioral observations in the field for 25 days. At the end of this time period, home range sizes were calculated as minimum convex polygons and ectoparasite intensities were quantified. Results of this study revealed no significant difference in ectoparasite intensities between high and low testosterone male <b>lizards,</b> but male <b>lizards</b> did have significantly higher ectoparasite intensities than female <b>lizards.</b> Furthermore, home range size and frequencies of territorial behaviors were not significantly different between high and low testosterone male <b>lizards.</b> However, male <b>lizards</b> did have larger home ranges and performed more territorial behaviors and movements than female <b>lizards.</b> These results suggest that home range, movement, and territorial behavior frequency contribute to higher ectoparasite intensities on male <b>lizards,</b> particularly those on males with high circulating testosterone. However, future studies need to address the behavioral and physiological mechanisms responsible for the observed effects of testosterone on parasitism, including parasite intensity, immunosuppression, and parasitic effects on host fitness...|$|R
5|$|The {{common toad}} (Bufo bufo) {{and the common}} frog (Rana temporaria) are the only {{amphibians}} on the site. They use it in winter or during their migration. The viviparous <b>lizard</b> (Zootoca vivipara) likes the slate deposits and ballast of the track. It hunts in the herbaceous areas, very flowery in summer and high in insects. The common wall <b>lizard</b> (Podarcis muralis) has been seen in 2013. The slowworm reproduction (Anguis fragilis) is attested by the observation of young under rocks and other debris.|$|E
5|$|The {{specimen}} NIGP127587 was preserved {{with the}} remains of a <b>lizard</b> in its gut region, indicating that small, fast-moving animals made up part of the diet of Sinosauropteryx prima. Numerous lizards of this type have been found in the same rocks as Sinosauropteryx. These lizards have been interpreted as most likely belonging to the genus Dalinghosaurus. Dalinghosaurus was probably a fast-running <b>lizard</b> adapted to living in open habitats, much like Sinosauropteryx itself.|$|E
5|$|Varanus salvadorii is {{a species}} of monitor <b>lizard,</b> which is endemic to New Guinea. It is also known by the common names {{crocodile}} monitor, Papua(n) monitor, Salvadori's monitor and artellia. The largest monitor <b>lizard</b> in New Guinea, it {{is believed to be}} one of the longest lizards in the world, verified at up to , and in rare cases it may rival or exceed the length of the world's largest <b>lizard,</b> the Komodo dragon. It is the sole member of the subgenus Papusaurus. V.salvadorii is an arboreal <b>lizard</b> with a dark green body and yellowish bands, a blunt snout and a very long tail. It lives in mangrove swamps and coastal rainforests in the southeastern part of the island, where it feeds on birds, small mammals, eggs, and carrion in the wild, using teeth better adapted than those of most monitors for seizing fast-moving prey. Like all monitors, it has anatomical features that enable it to breathe more easily when running than other lizards can, and V. salvadorii may have greater stamina than most monitors. Little is known of its reproduction and development, as the species is very difficult to breed in captivity.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration {{approved}} the drug exenatide (marketed as Byetta) {{for the management}} of type 2 diabetes. It is a synthetic version of a protein, exendin-4, derived from the Gila monster's saliva. In a three-year study with people with type 2 diabetes, exenatide led to healthy sustained glucose levels and progressive weight loss. The effectiveness is because the <b>lizard</b> protein is about 50% identical to glucagon-like peptide-1 analog (GLP-1), a hormone released from the human digestive tract that helps to regulate insulin and glucagon. The <b>lizard</b> protein remains effective much longer than the human hormone, helping diabetics keep their blood sugar levels under control. Exenatide slows the emptying of the stomach and causes a decrease in appetite, contributing to weight loss.|$|E

5|$|Manual {{removal of}} the Japanese {{knotweed}} has preserved heritage stations of common butterbur and hart's-tongue fern. Early hand pruning was conducive to orchids. The late mowing seems rather ineffective. The grubbing-up of the Canada golden-rod and American asters was successful. The bush clearing and selective logging have helped maintain the wood-fringe with narrow-leaved everlasting-pea and liquorice milkvetch. Common spotted orchid, zigzag clover and lesser butterfly-orchid, species non-adapted to open areas, benefited areas without clearing. The low dry-stone walls probably favored the installation of viviparous <b>lizard</b> or common wall <b>lizard,</b> observed in 2013, but also the consolidation of the hart's-tongue fern population.|$|E
