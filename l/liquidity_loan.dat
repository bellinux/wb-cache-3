40|$|We study {{an economy}} where {{consumers}} {{are subject to}} liquidity demand shocks and banks arise endogenously to provide insurance against these shocks. We evaluate the desirability of having an elastic currency generated by a lender of last resort that prints money and makes <b>liquidity</b> <b>loans</b> to banks in distress.

The introduction of unlimited lending at a zero nominal interest rate generates a steady state equilibrium allocation that is Pareto optimal.

We then explore two restrictions on the provision of <b>liquidity</b> <b>loans</b> that can rule out such monetary instability while preserving some of the steady-state bene…ts of lending.

The data analysis technique used in this research are CAMEL ratio is the aspect Capital (Capital Adequacy Ratio / CAR), assets (Assets Quality / KAP) and (Allowance for Earning Assets / PPAP), Management (Net Profit Margin / NPM), Earnings (Return On Assets / ROA) and (Operating Expenses to Operating Income / ROA), and <b>Liquidity</b> (<b>Loan</b> to Deposit Ratio / LDR) adopted from Meliangan, Steven, et al.

By guaranteeing {{the value of}} depositors 2 ̆ 7 funds at a rate independent of risk, {{deposit insurance}} removes the market discipline that otherwise acts to restrain risk-taking behavior. ^ Previous studies of deposit insurance have been mostly devoted to examining changes in the risk-taking behavior of banks or savings and loans. This study examined changes in credit union risk-taking following establishment of the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) in 1971. ^ Financial ratios proxying for capital adequacy, <b>liquidity,</b> and <b>loan</b> delinquency were tested to determine if credit unions increased risk following implementation of deposit insurance. Time series tests employing industry average financial ratios for federal and state credit unions {{did not support the}} increased risk-taking hypothesis. Although federal credit union capital ratios did fall immediately following adoption of deposit insurance, this was most likely the result of reduced capital requirements, not deposit insurance. Decreases in regulatory capital were typically offset by increases in discretionary capital. Additional time series analyses examining the behavior of both <b>liquidity</b> and <b>loan</b> delinquency ratios further suggested that risk-taking behavior actually declined during the post-insurance period. ^ Individual credit union data for Iowa state-chartered credit unions were used to examine pre- and post-insurance risk levels. Like the time series results, the majority of these tests rejected the hypothesis that insurance increased risk-taking behavior. Many of these results, again, suggested that deposit insurance was associated with higher levels of capital and greater liquidity. Taken together {{the results of this study}} did not support the notion that deposit insurance caused an increase in credit union risk-taking behavior. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to assess}} the {{financial}} performance of firms that adopted or deferred the adoption of SSAP 20 “Foreign Currency Translation”. The focus {{of the study is}} to examine the impact of certain accounting issues, such as liquidity, hedging, foreign currency loans, managerial compensation, pre- and post SSAP 20 treatment of translation differences, etc, on the behaviour of firms. Design/methodology/approach – The paper follows the positive accounting theory context and utilises parametric (logistic regression) and non-parametric (Kruskal–Wallis test) tests to form and test theoretical hypotheses and relations between groups of firms with different financial characteristics. Findings – The study provides evidence that the implementation of SSAP 20 has overall strengthened the financial position of adopters. Adopters that used different translation methods prior to adoption tend to exhibit different financial characteristics (e. g. higher leverage) in the pre-actual adoption period. In contrast, they present no substantial differences in the actual adoption period. The findings show that adopters give priority to their stock market picture and tend to distribute higher dividend to their shareholders even if this leads to lower management payout. Research limitations/implications – Firstly, for the period under investigation, the availability of accounting and financial data and the disclosure of accounting information in the financial statements were to some extent limited. Secondly, {{it is difficult to see}} through managers’ inner intentions, and as a result managers’ behaviour and motives may not always be clear and conceivable to outsiders. Originality/value – This study has significant implications for accounting standard setting bodies and investors. It provides insight about firms’ objectives and potential attitude and reaction to the issue of accounting regulation. This study also formulates the basis for studying firms’ behaviour and reaction with regard to other accounting standards and financial issues.
