500|$|Adams {{decided to}} focus on the game's {{development}} full-time during his first year of his math post-doctorate at Texas A in 2006. The university offered him $50,000 if he would stay another year.

[...] Later, Adams expected he would use his $15,000 savings for a year and then have to get a job in order to support himself because the game had not been released yet. Development continued till 8 August 2006, when the first alpha version (version 0.21.93.19a) was released. Donations reached $800–$1000 in the following months, this average increased gradually until they were financially stable. He then decided to solely rely on donations.|$|E

Gerstmann wrote: [...] "When I {{reflect on the}} experience, I'll probably think about the times the game locked up on me or broke in a dozen other crazy ways first, before thinking about the great world and the objectives that fill it.

[...] 1UP.com's Mike Nelson wrote [...] "On one hand, it feels <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> recommend this to any fan of the Fallout series. I single these fans out because they're willing to forgive silly bugs like meeting characters who walk into walls or occasionally float in mid-air. These fans realize that the game as a whole is greater than the sum of minor graphical anomalies. [...] On the other hand, I simply can't ignore or forgive the game for crashing on me when I walk around the Mojave Wasteland; or for quests that simply can't be completed because of a game glitch; or for making my companions disappear when I need them the most during a battle. These {{are some of the most}} frustrating bugs I have ever encountered with any game, especially when attached to a series that I deeply enjoy." ...|$|E

Tricky drew on Rastafarian ideas about end time for the record, although unlike adherents to that movement he did not disassociate himself from [...] "Babylon", or the degenerate qualities of Western society, writing lyrics such as [...] "my brain thinks bomb-like/beware of our appetite" [...] on [...] "Hell Is Round the Corner". He later told Reynolds, [...] "I'm part of this fuckin' psychic pollution... It's <b>like,</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> be as greedy as you.

[...] Christgau deemed the album's songs [...] "audioramas of someone who's signed on to work for the wages of sin and lived to cash the check", while O'Hagan said Tricky's [...] "impressionistic prose poems" [...] were written from the deviant perspective of the urban hedonist: [...] "Maxinquaye is the sound of blunted Britain, paranoid and obsessive...

Ladytron said following about the sessions with the singer, [...] "We went in with no expectations; the whole thing was a massive surprise. But it was incredible. She was so musically talented, a vocalist who really knows her voice. The first takes sounded really amazing, and while we'd made demos, it was only when her voice was on them that it all came to life."
