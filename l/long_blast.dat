2500|$|Yom Kippur, ("Day of Atonement") is the holiest {{day of the}} Jewish year. It is a day of {{communal}} fasting and praying for forgiveness for one's sins. Observant Jews spend the entire day in the synagogue, sometimes with a short break in the afternoon, reciting prayers from a special holiday prayerbook called a [...] "Machzor". Many non-religious Jews {{make a point of}} attending synagogue services and fasting on Yom Kippur. On the eve of Yom Kippur, before candles are lit, a prefast meal, the [...] "seuda mafseket", is eaten. Synagogue services on the eve of Yom Kippur begin with the Kol Nidre prayer. It is customary to wear white on Yom Kippur, especially for Kol Nidre, and leather shoes are not worn. The following day, prayers are held from morning to evening. The final prayer service, called [...] "Ne'ilah", ends with a <b>long</b> <b>blast</b> of the shofar.|$|E
2500|$|The Voitenko {{compressor}} initially separates a {{test gas}} from a shaped charge with a malleable steel plate. When the shaped charge detonates, {{most of its}} energy {{is focused on the}} steel plate, driving it forward and pushing the test gas ahead of it. Ames Research Center translated this idea into a self-destroying shock tube. A [...] shaped charge accelerated the gas in a 3-cm glass-walled tube 2 meters in length. The velocity of the resulting shock wave was a phenomenal [...] The apparatus exposed to the detonation was, of course, completely destroyed, but not before useful data were extracted. In a typical Voitenko compressor, a shaped charge accelerates hydrogen gas, which in turn accelerates a thin disk up to about 40km/s. A slight modification to the Voitenko compressor concept is a super-compressed detonation, a device that uses a compressible liquid or solid fuel in the steel compression chamber instead of a traditional gas mixture. A further extension of this technology is the explosive diamond anvil cell, utilizing multiple opposed shaped-charge jets projected at a single steel-encapsulated fuel, such as hydrogen. The fuels used in these devices, along with the secondary combustion reactions and <b>long</b> <b>blast</b> impulse, produce similar conditions to those encountered in fuel-air and thermobaric explosives.|$|E

60|$|But {{small as}} was the party and humble the surroundings, the King in no way relaxed that love of ceremony, of {{elaborate}} form and of brilliant coloring {{which was one of}} his characteristics. The sumpter-mules were unpacked, squires ran hither and thither, baths smoked in the bed-chambers, silks and satins were unfolded, gold chains gleamed and clinked, so that when at last, to the <b>long</b> <b>blast</b> of two court trumpeters, the company took their seats at the board, it was the brightest, fairest scene which those old black rafters had ever spanned.|$|E
60|$|Night closed in, {{but still}} no guest arrived. The baron {{descended from the}} tower in despair. The banquet, which had been delayed from hour to hour, {{could no longer be}} postponed. The meats were already overdone, the cook in an agony, and the whole {{household}} had the look of a garrison, that had been reduced by famine. The baron was obliged reluctantly to give orders for the feast without the presence of the guest. All were seated at table, and just on the point of commencing, when the sound of a horn from without the gate gave notice of the approach of a stranger. Another <b>long</b> <b>blast</b> filled the old courts of the castle with its echoes, and was answered by the warder from the walls. The baron hastened to receive his future son-in-law.|$|E
6000|$|Before {{we reached}} the dip or saddle where R.C. was to make his stand the hounds opened up far below. The morning was {{perfectly}} still, an unusual occurrence there along the rim. What wild music! Then Edd's horn pealed out, ringing melody, a <b>long</b> <b>blast</b> keen and clear, telling us above that he had started a bear. That made us hurry. We arrived {{at the head of}} an incline leading down to R.C.'s stand. As luck would have it the place was ideal for a bear, but risky for a hunter. A bear could come four ways without being seen until he was close enough to kill a man. We hurried on. At the saddle there was a broad bear trail with several other trails leading into it. Suddenly R.C. halted me with a warning finger. [...] "Listen!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Tacoma {{continued}} in service until better roads and increased automobile and bus traffic between Seattle and Tacoma forced the termination of regular marine passenger between the two cities. Tacoma 's last run on December 15, 1930 marked the real end of commercial passenger activity for steamboats on Puget Sound. Marine historians Newell and Williamson documented the occasion: The Tacoma and the Indianapolis passed a little south of Three Tree Point. ... Capt.

40|$|Much {{research}} has been conducted towards short duration blast loading and its interaction with structures. The positive phase duration, t+, of a typical short duration high explosive blast is often below t+= 100 ms. For the purposes of this research, <b>long</b> duration <b>blast</b> is considered to be an explosive event in which t+> 100 ms. This type of blast load offers added complexity when dealing with its interaction with structures due to the high impulses, drag winds and associated dynamic pressures. As part of an extended research study to develop a set of predictive algorithms, this paper investigates the breakage patterns and debris distribution of masonry panels subject to <b>long</b> duration <b>blast</b> loads. Experimental trials were conducted using the Air Blast Tunnel at MoD Shoeburyness, a specialised facility for <b>long</b> duration <b>blast,</b> in which two masonry panels were tested. The trials displayed varying degrees of breakage followed by a substantial debris distribution in both cases...|$|R

50|$|On {{the night}} of 14 September, two red rockets were fired from an {{accompanying}} destroyer that had spotted a submarine periscope. The destroyer dropped depth charges on the submarine, and the Baltic made a sudden turn to port, that caused both men and anything loose aboard the ship to move.
