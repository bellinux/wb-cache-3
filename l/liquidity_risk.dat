With forward-looking banks, lending cycles, credit booms and busts, or suppressed and highly fragile bank systems can emerge, {{depending on the}} magnitude of <b>liquidity</b> <b>risks.</b> In this context, regulatory stability-enhancing measures have some unpleasant effects on bank lending. Imposing countercyclical capital adequacy ratio may amplify procyclicality or result in disintermediation, when <b>liquidity</b> <b>risks</b> are only moderate and financial stability is barely a threat.

The required collateral is agreed on by the parties when the CDS is first issued. This margin amount may vary {{over the life of}} the CDS contract, if the market price of the CDS contract changes, or the credit rating of one of the parties changes.

2500|$|Hedge funds {{share many}} of the same types of risk as other {{investment}} classes, including <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> and manager risk. Liquidity refers to the degree to which an asset can be bought and sold or converted to cash; similar to private equity funds, hedge funds employ a lock-up period during which an investor cannot remove money. Manager risk refers to those risks which arise from the management of funds. As well as specific risks such as style drift, which refers to a fund manager [...] "drifting" [...] away from an area of specific expertise, manager risk factors include valuation risk, capacity risk, concentration risk and leverage risk. Valuation risk refers to the concern that the net asset value of investments may be inaccurate; capacity risk can arise from placing too much money into one particular strategy, which may lead to fund performance deterioration; and concentration risk may arise if a fund has too much exposure to a particular investment, sector, trading strategy, or group of correlated funds. These risks may be managed through defined controls over conflict of interest, restrictions on allocation of funds, and set exposure limits for strategies.|$|E

40|$|The article {{summarizes}} the key results of researches {{in the field}} of early warning systems for financial crises, conducted by the Center for Macroeconomic Analysis and Short-Term Forecasting (CMASF) since 2005. The proposed early warning system consists of three major blocks: the leading indicators of certain types of risks and the composite leading indicator of a systemic banking crisis; the medium-term scenario forecasting of key macroeconomic and financial indicators; stress testing of credit and <b>liquidity</b> <b>risks</b> of banks. On the basis of this early warning system we estimate the risks of financial crisis and some kinds of systemic risks in the different scenarios for the Russian economy in 2012. The analysis, in particular, revealed a sensitivity threshold of the domestic financial sector to changes in the world oil prices. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} greatest destabilizing effect on the Russian financial sector may be caused by systemic credit risk. systemic financial crises, credit <b>risks,</b> <b>liquidity</b> <b>risks,</b> currency risks, early warning system, leading indicators, stress testing...|$|R
50|$|As the {{possibility}} that over a specific horizon the bank will become unable to settle obligations with immediacy, funding <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> is another significant definition to describe economic ability. According to IMF, funding <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> means latent of possible that financial intermediary is unable to repay the liability in expiration of obligation. Funding <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> relies on the four liquidity sources above. The features of funding <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> and market <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> are similar. For most time, Funding <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> is low and stable, and occasionally makes great shock.|$|E
50|$|Accordingly, <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> has to {{be managed}} in {{addition}} to market, credit and other risks. Because of its tendency to compound other risks, it is difficult or impossible to isolate <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk.</b> In {{all but the most}} simple of circumstances, comprehensive metrics of <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> do not exist. Certain techniques of asset liability management can be applied to assessing <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk.</b> A simple test for <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> is to look at future net cash flows on a day-by-day basis. Any day that has a sizeable negative net cash flow is of concern. Such an analysis can be supplemented with stress testing. Look at net cash flows on a day-to-day basis assuming that an important counterparty defaults.|$|E

This paper derives and tests a financial fragility condition for predicting asset price peaks on a real-time basis, by combining the term spread and the aggregate funding <b>liquidity</b> <b>risks</b> of the banking system into a simple binary fragility indicator. The main empirical result {{of this paper is}} that the fragility condition predicted all major equity market peaks in Germany during the time period 1973 to 2010, including the subprime crisis of 2007, the New Economy Bubble of 2000, and the 1987 stock market crash.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} and assesses various explanations attributed {{as principal}} factors {{of the recent}} Financial Crisis. In particular, it focuses on two principal regulatory tools which constitute {{the basis of the}} framework promulgated by recent Basel Committee's initiatives, that is, Basel III. These two regulatory tools being capital and liquidity requirements. Various conclusions have been put forward to explain what triggered the recent Financial Crisis. This paper aims to explain why the Basel Committee's liquidity requirements and present proposals aimed at addressing <b>liquidity</b> <b>risks,</b> still represent a very modest milestone in efforts aimed at addressing challenges in prudential regulation and supervision. Even though problems attributed to capital adequacy requirements are considered by many authorities to have triggered the recent Crisis, the paper will highlight how runs on banks are triggered by liquidity crises and that <b>liquidity</b> <b>risks</b> cannot be isolated from systemic risks. In so doing, it will incorporate the roles assumed by information asymmetries and market based regulation – hence elaborate on how market based regulation could serve to address problems which trigger <b>liquidity</b> <b>risks.</b> Imperfect knowledge being a factor which is contributory to liquidity crises and bank runs, and market based regulation being essential in facilitating disclosure - since the Basel Committee's focus on banks and prudential supervision cannot on its own, address the challenges encountered in the present regulatory environment. Furthermore, it will address measures and proposals which could serve as bases for future regulatory reforms - as well as criticisms and challenges still encountered by recent Basel Committee initiatives. ...|$|R
50|$|Funding <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> {{captures the}} {{inability}} of a financial intermediary to service its liabilities as they fall due. This type of risk is particularly relevant for banks since their business model involves funding long-term loans through short-term deposits and other liabilities. The healthy functioning of interbank lending markets can help reduce funding <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> because banks can obtain loans in this market quickly and at little cost. When interbank markets are dysfunctional or strained, banks face a greater funding <b>liquidity</b> <b>risk</b> which in extreme cases can result in insolvency.|$|E
