60|$|The moon had not risen, but a pale glow shone above a gray {{peak and}} the sky was clear. One could not see much in the hollow, but the snow {{reflected}} a faint light. The timbers they had erected rose like a black skeleton, and after glancing at them, Charnock's eyes were drawn towards the pile of logs in the pond at the water's edge. A <b>log</b> <b>pond</b> is generally made in a river, where the stream will carry the trunks into the containing chains. But Festing had made his on land, using the snow instead of the current. Charnock could not tell what had attracted his attention, but stood motionless for a moment or two.|$|E

50|$|Log ponds are {{convenient}} water reservoirs for firefighting at sawmills; and {{for routine}} cooling and lubrication of saw blades and other mill machinery. Stormwater runoff from the mill yard and wastewater generated within the sawmill often {{flow into the}} <b>log</b> <b>pond</b> as the lowest point adjacent to the sawmill. Boiler blowdown, lumber drying kiln condensate, and exhaust steam from sawmill machinery sometimes kept a <b>log</b> <b>pond</b> from freezing during cold weather.|$|E
40|$|The Yoncalla <b>Log</b> <b>Ponds</b> are {{a series}} of four ponds located in within the city limits of the town in Yoncalla in {{northern}} Douglas County, Oregon. The ponds were created in stages between the late 1930 s and the 1950 s and used for log storage through the 1970 s (North Douglas Betterment 2014). North Douglas Betterment purchased the land surrounding the ponds and contracted with the Center for Lakes and Reservoirs at Portland State University to assess the current morphometry, vegetation and water quality status of the ponds and provide recommendations for management of the aquatic vegetation. The scope of this document covers the current status assessment of the ponds using data collected from June 2013 through May 2014...|$|R

50|$|Log ponds are {{convenient}} reservoirs {{for water}} recycling in applications including hydraulic debarkers or dust suppression. Log ponds offer some wastewater treatment {{similar to a}} settling basin and facultative lagoon. <b>Log</b> <b>pond</b> overflow during rainfall and snowmelt may contain floating pieces of wood and bark, dissolved organic compounds leached from wood, and suspended particles of sawdust and soil. The United States Environmental Protection Agency published wet storage category effluent limitations in the 1970s prohibiting discharge of floating woody debris and requiring <b>log</b> <b>pond</b> overflow pH to be between 6 and 9.|$|E
5000|$|The Algoma Lumber Company logged {{all around}} Upper Klamath Lake. The company used a {{diesel-powered}} tugboat to tow log rafts to the mill site. The Algoma lumber mill's <b>log</b> <b>pond</b> {{was connected to}} the lake by a 20 ft culvert that ran under the railroad embankment. Because of the shallow depth of the channel that connected the lake with the <b>log</b> <b>pond,</b> the company insisted that Upper Klamath Lake be maintained at a high level. [...] The tugboat used by the Algoma Lumber Company was retired in 1943. Today, it is on display at the logging museum at Collier Memorial State Park, which is located 30 mi north of Klamath Falls on U.S. Route 97.|$|E
50|$|Some logs {{were removed}} from the lake bottom in the late 1990s but many remain still on the bottom, {{remnants}} of a near century of <b>log</b> <b>pond</b> use. A few logs rise to the surface in spring every year causing hazard to boat traffic.|$|E
5000|$|In 1930 O'Brien {{became a}} {{founding}} member of the Beach Erosion Board having been hired two years earlier by its predecessor organization. His interest in beach erosion led him to author a seven-volume study of the entire United States Pacific coastline, A Report on Sand Movement and Beach Erosion Along the Pacific Coast of the United States, in which he both addressed every American inlet and harbor on the Pacific and documented the phenomenon of littoral drift. O'Brien continued to serve as a member of the Beach Erosion Board and beyond 1963, its successor organization, the Coastal Engineering Research Center until his retirement in 1978. [...] In the late 1930s O'Brien did consulting work for Weyerhaeuser Company to improve the flow in their <b>log</b> <b>ponds.</b> He also provided consultation on the placement of caissons during the construction of the ill-fated Tacoma Narrows Bridge. O'Brien had also been on the consulting board of the Waterways Experiment Station.|$|R
50|$|Lake Rose {{was built}} by Jesse Dodson, a {{squatter}} who made bedsteads out of cherry trees, and built the lake as a <b>log</b> splash <b>pond.</b> In 1905, Colonel R. Bruce Ricketts reinforced the Lake Rose dam. However, due to the dam's poor construction, the lake {{could not be used}} for hydroelectric power. In the middle of the 20th century, the state of Pennsylvania condemned the dam and drained the lake.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} mechanized sawmills of {{the industrial}} revolution were built on navigable rivers, lakes, or estuaries where logs could be floated to the sawmill and lumber could be carried to markets aboard ships or barges. Early steam sawmills included a hoist to lift logs {{out of the water}} onto a carriage which moved the log past a stationary powered saw. Men could relatively easily push floating logs into position to be lifted by the hoist. Forests distant from navigable water became accessible with the development of railroads. Sawmills adjacent to navigable waters were termed cargo mills, in contrast to interior rail mills relying upon railroad transportation of logs and lumber. Until tractors powered by internal combustion engines were powerful enough to move <b>logs,</b> <b>ponds</b> were required to simplify movement of logs from storage to the sawmill hoist. Storage of logs in water has the additional advantages of minimizing fire risks, washing away dirt which could dull saws, and preventing splitting of logs which might otherwise dry prior to milling. Cargo mills typically used a system of floating log booms to contain stored logs from delivery until milling.|$|R
50|$|Lake Ewauna {{was home}} to several lumber mills in the 20th century, and was a <b>log</b> <b>pond</b> for those mills. The last {{floating}} logs {{came out in the}} 1990s as the last mill on the lake shore, Modoc Lumber Company, closed its doors. The former Modoc mill site is now being developed as Timbermill Shores.|$|E

50|$|A <b>log</b> <b>pond</b> {{is a small}} natural lake or {{reservoir}} {{used for}} storage of wooden logs in readiness for milling at a sawmill. Although some mill ponds served this purpose for water powered sawmills, steam-powered sawmills used log ponds for transportation of logs near the mill; and did not require the elevation drop of watermill reservoirs.|$|E
50|$|Lovegren {{established}} a sawmill {{in the community}} and in September 1911 began operating a private electricity grid in Cherry Grove. He used the sawmill's boiler in the operation, and in September 1913 completed a dam on the Tualatin River to create a large <b>log</b> retention <b>pond.</b> In January 1914, a flood destroyed both the dam and the boiler, leaving the community without electricity until Portland General Electric added service in 1935. Cherry Grove's post office ran from 1912 through 1959 when service was transferred to Gaston.|$|R
50|$|The {{property}} was not logged for many years, {{as the family}} desired to maintain it in a primitive condition. However, in 1911-1919, a softwood harvest was performed by the Mac-a-Mac Lumber Corporation, of which John N. McDonald and Benjamin Brandreth McAlpin, son of Gen. Edwin A. McAlpin, were principals. This first harvest was extensive, with between 30-35 railcars of spruce logs shipped daily to the St Regis Paper Company's plant in Deferiet. Additionally, Mac-a-Mac was storing an additional 70 carloads of cut <b>logs</b> in <b>ponds</b> and lakes for later transport off the property. A second harvest {{took place in the}} mid-1920s. Since then the family has permitted occasional selective harvesting.|$|R

50|$|The mill {{utilized}} Yakima River water {{brought to}} the area through a system of canals. A horizontal water wheel powered both the gristmill and a nearby sawmill. An ice pond and <b>log</b> <b>pond</b> were located nearby, as well. The ice pond was used for recreational skating, and from it ice was harvested to chill the train cars that carried local fresh produce to market.|$|E
50|$|The 7 acre {{location}} is for recreational {{as well as}} educational use. An amphitheater, picnic tables, and barbecue pits in the forest and along the lakefront. From the museum, easy walking trails lead to swimming, boating and fishing at White Pines Park, and to a hiking trail {{all the way around}} White Pines Lake, passing the site of the old Blagen Sawmill and its <b>log</b> <b>pond.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Sandy River and Rangeley Lakes Railroad {{followed}} the west shore of Toothaker pond {{in the northern}} part of Phillips. The pond overflows into the Sandy River 1 mi to the south. Berlin Mills Co. built a sawmill in 1902 using Toothaker Pond as a <b>log</b> <b>pond.</b> The pond shoreline was developed with residences and seasonal cabins after the sawmill closed in 1908. The pond has summer algal blooms and dissolved oxygen deficiencies making it unsuitable for trout, but it holds rainbow smelt, golden shiner and redbelly dace.|$|E
5000|$|SS Peralta is a {{concrete}} floating breakwater in the Powell River in British Columbia. She was built as {{a concrete}} oil tanker by the San Francisco Shipbuilding Company, and was launched in February 1921. The ship is 128 m long, with a beam of 15.4 m and has a volume of 6,144 GRT. Her sister ship is [...] She was acquired in 1924 and converted into a sardine cannery in Alaska. After spending 24 years in this role the ship was moored off Antioch, California. She was bought by Pacifica Papers in 1958 and moored {{as part of a}} giant floating breakwater on the Powell River to protect the companys <b>log</b> storage <b>pond.</b> She is the oldest and largest American-built concrete ship still afloat.|$|R
50|$|Until {{the early}} 20th century timber rafting was an {{important}} {{branch of the economy}} in the Black Forest. Like its neighbouring rivers, the Murg and Nagold, the Enz was used for transporting tree trunks and, especially, <b>logs.</b> Schwallungen (storage <b>ponds</b> that were drained for rafting), such as the Poppelsee and Kaltenbachsee at Gompelscheuer, recall this activity. In the Black Forest section of the Enz valley today forest products and tourism dominate the economy.|$|R
5000|$|For a {{time the}} town thrived. But the company, {{functioning}} on a [...] "cut and move" [...] theory, packed up and disassembled the entire town almost overnight, in 1933, having cut all the virgin timber in the immediate area. The town had two 1 acre ponds used to float <b>logs.</b> The <b>ponds</b> still exist today, located just outside Mount Ida on Arkansas Highway 270. Nothing remains today short of a few concrete blocks where the mill once stood, and the two ponds. Both ponds were turned into a fish hatchery in 1940. There is a vacant field {{to the side of}} the ponds where the town once stood. All the larger buildings were torn down, while the smaller ones were moved to a new site near Forester, in Scott County.|$|R
5000|$|Roosevelt elk graze the {{wetlands}} {{south of the}} lagoon and may sometimes be seen where U.S. Route 101 crosses the lagoon. Hammond Lumber Company Plant Three included 20th century company housing and a sawmill <b>log</b> <b>pond</b> built where Maple Creek enters {{the south end of}} Big Lagoon. [...] The coastal portion of Big Lagoon was used as an aerial rocket range by the United States Navy during World War II. [...] Canoe access to Big Lagoon is available from a park on the south shore near the community of Big Lagoon and Big Lagoon Rancheria.|$|E
50|$|New Yarmouth {{occupies}} a plateau 244 metres (800 feet) above West Advocate overlooking Advocate Bay, {{a branch of}} the Bay of Fundy. The highest point in Cape Chignecto Provincial Park is located on a summit of 275 metres (900 feet) just north of the New Yarmouth fire tower. McGahey Brook and Mill Brook have their source at New Yarmouth, draining south to Advocate Bay through deep ravines, while Copp Hollow Brook also begins at New Yarmouth, draining to the north. An abandoned <b>log</b> <b>pond</b> and several beaver ponds are found near the source of these brooks.|$|E
5000|$|Rail mills {{were built}} {{adjacent}} to small ponds when possible, but log ponds were often constructed {{by building a}} dam on a small stream where no suitable natural pond was available. Risks of periodic flood damage discouraged use of larger rivers for log ponds, but water might be diverted or pumped from a larger river to maintain water levels in an adjacent <b>log</b> <b>pond.</b> [...] A railway spur would be built to a [...] where logs might be rolled or hoisted off flat cars into the pond. [...] Log ponds were constructed with surface area allowing floating storage of the inventory of logs required to maintain sawmill production through periods when logging or rail deliveries might be interrupted.|$|E
25|$|More than 100 insects {{have been}} {{reported}} to infest hickory trees and wood products, but only a few cause death or severe damage (1). The hickory bark beetle (Scolytus quadrispinosus) is the most important insect enemy of hickory, and {{also one of the most}} important insect pests of hardwoods in the Eastern United States. During drought periods in the Southeast, outbreaks often develop and large tracts of timber are killed. At other times, damage may be confined to the killing of a single tree or to portions of the tops of trees. The foliage of heavily infested trees turns red within a few weeks after attack, and the trees soon die. There is one generation per year in northern areas and normally two broods per year in the South. Control consists of felling infested trees and destroying the bark during winter months or storing infested <b>logs</b> in <b>ponds.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1839, {{with renewed}} {{conflict}} with the Ojibwa nation, Chief Cloud Man relocated his band of the Mdewakanton Dakota from Lake Calhoun, Bde Maka Ska in Minneapolis to an area named Oak Grove in southern Bloomington, close to present-day Portland Avenue. In 1843, Peter and Louisa Quinn, the first European settlers to live in Bloomington, built a cabin along the Minnesota River in this area. The government had sent them to teach farming methods to the Native Americans. Gideon Hollister Pond, a missionary, who had been following and recording the Dakota language from Cloud Man's band, relocated later that year, establishing Oak Grove Mission, his <b>log</b> cabin. <b>Pond</b> and his family held church services and taught the local Dakota school subjects and farming. Passage across the Minnesota River in Bloomington came in 1849 when William Chambers and Joseph Dean opened the Bloomington Ferry. The ferry remained operational until 1889, when the Bloomington Ferry Bridge was built.|$|R
