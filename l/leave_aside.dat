And that thing is the price of oil and natural gas." [...] In the closing paragraphs of his 2008 book, the retired general said: [...] "Behind the gilded facade of Moscow and Saint Petersburg, there lies a demolished country that, under the current characteristics of those in power, has no chance to restore itself as one of the developed states of the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{agreement}} for Weber to <b>leave</b> <b>aside</b> European threads [...] likely will follow up foreshadowings of overt dislike evinced by various Grantville natives {{for both the}} African slave trade and the Amerindian encounters with colonizing Europeansand Flint has already written a very sympathetic, two-volume alternate history from the American Native's viewpoint in his Arkansas Wars seriesand he'd written similar foreshadowings into the series' earlier works that were spun into pro-democracy and anti-anti-Semitic social themes now manifesting in the series in the Eastern Europe thread in particular, {{as well as an}} overall, muted sub-theme. This revised author's decision released a logjam of backup of other novels in the series, so that since rehashing their arrangement, 1632 series books have been released regularly every 4–6 months.|$|E
2500|$|The soundtrack {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics, with many calling it [...] "safe" [...] and a disappointment. Joginder Tuteja gave {{a rating of}} three out of five, terming it a mixed bag and wrote [...] "There isn't anything which comes across as memorable enough to be played a few months down the line, <b>leave</b> <b>aside</b> a few years. Eventually {{what you get is}} a soundtrack that would go along with the narrative and acts as a good situational ingredient but that's about it." [...] Koimoi also gave three out of five writing that album fall short of expectations. Planet Bollywood gave 5.5 out of 10, feeling [...] "Hai Ye Maaya" [...] was the only song worth listening, and wrote [...] " [...] Don 2 doesn't quite live up to expectations which were sky high after the huge success of the first film- it's a soundtrack that will only work alongside the movie and will take the story forward, but as an audio alone it just doesn't deliver. S-E-L play it safe by continuing on from where they left in the previous venture and there is hardly any innovation." [...] Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com gave the album a rating of two out of five calling it [...] "safe and self-conscious" [...] and wrote [...] "Don 2's music could fare much better if the composers Shankar-Ehsaan-and Loy had tried {{to step out of the}} prequel's shadow." ...|$|E

But {{in about a week}} I hope to try back and send you the first four numbers: these are all drafted, it is only the {{revision}} that has broken me down, as it is often the hardest work.

For the present I <b>leave</b> <b>aside</b> the small stone, inscribed with concentric horse-shoes, and found in a hill-fort near Tarbert (Kintyre), which a friend already spoken of saw, and of which he drew for me a sketch from memory. In country houses any intrinsically valueless object of this kind is apt to fall out of sight and be lost beyond recovery.|$|E

60|$|When {{the king}} saw how very young the prince looked, {{and that he}} was still {{drinking}} of the fountain of wonder, he said: 'O youth! <b>leave</b> <b>aside</b> this fancy which my daughter has conceived in the pride of her beauty. No one can answer er her riddle, and she has done to death many men who had had no pleasure in life nor tasted its charms. God forbid that your spring also should be ravaged by the autumn winds of martyrdom.' All his urgency, however, had no effect in making the prince withdraw. At length it was settled between them that three days should be given to pleasant hospitality and that then should follow what had to be said and done. Then the prince went to his own quarters and was treated as became his station.|$|E
6000|$|The most {{constant}} reproach {{which is}} launched against persons {{of my way}} of thinking is that it is all very well for us to talk about the deductions of scientific thought, but what are the poor and the {413} uneducated to do? Has it ever occurred to those who talk in this fashion, that their creeds and the articles of their several confessions, their determination of the exact nature and extent of the teachings of Jesus, their expositions of the real meaning of that which is written in the Epistles (to <b>leave</b> <b>aside</b> all questions concerning the Old Testament), are nothing more than deductions which, at any rate, profess {{to be the result of}} strictly scientific thinking, and which are not worth attending to unless they really possess that character? If it is not historically true that such and such things happened in Palestine eighteen centuries ago, what becomes of Christianity? And what is historical truth but that of which the evidence bears strict scientific investigation? I do not call to mind any problem of natural science which has come under my notice which is more difficult, or more curiously interesting as a mere problem, than that of the origin of the Synoptic Gospels and that of the historical value of the narratives which they contain. The Christianity of the Churches stands or falls by the results of the purely scientific investigation of these questions. They were first taken up in a purely scientific spirit just about a century ago; they have been studied over and over again by men of vast knowledge and critical acumen; but he would be a rash man who should assert that any solution of these problems, as yet formulated, is exhaustive. The most that can be said is that certain prevalent solutions are certainly false, while others are more or less probably true. {414} ...|$|E
60|$|I did {{not doubt}} the fact when I read of {{it under the}} level boughs of the beechen tree with J. W., sixty years ago, by the green {{woodland}} light of the primeval forest which hemmed our village in, and since I am {{well away from the}} Alhambra again I do not doubt it now. I doubt nothing that Irving says of the Alhambra; he is the gentle genius of the place, and I could almost wish that I had paid the ten pesetas extra which the custodian demanded for showing his apartment in the palace. On the ground the demand of two dollars seemed a gross extortion; yet it was not too much for a devotion so rich as mine to have paid, and I advise other travelers to buy themselves off from a vain regret by giving it. If ever a memory merited the right to levy tribute on all comers to the place it haunts, Washington Irving's is that memory. His Conquest of Granada is still the history which one would wish to read; his Tales of the Alhambra embody fable and fact in just the right measure for the heart's desire {{in the presence of the}} monuments they verify or falsify. They belong to that strange age of romance which is now so almost pathetic and to which one cannot refuse his sympathy without sensible loss. But for the eager make-believe of that time we should still have to hoard up much rubbish which we can now <b>leave</b> <b>aside,</b> or accept without bothering to assay for the few grains of gold in it. Washington Irving had just the playful kindness which sufficed best to deal with the accumulations of his age; if he does not forbid you to believe, he does not oblige you to disbelieve, and he has always a tolerant civility in his humor which comports best with the duty of taking leniently a history impossible to take altogether seriously. Till the Spaniards had put an end to the Moorish misrule, with its ruthless despotism and bloody civil brawls, the Moors deserved to be conquered; it was not till their power was broken forever that they became truly heroic in their vain struggles and their unavailing sorrows. Then their pathetic resignation to persecution and exile lent dignity even to their ridiculous religion; but it was of the first and not the second period that Irving had to treat.|$|E

5000|$|Wycliffe was {{not merely}} {{conscious}} {{of the distinction between}} theology and philosophy, but his sense of reality led him to pass by scholastic questions.
