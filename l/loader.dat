5|$|Prime was {{released}} for the GameCube in five versions. The original North American and Japanese NTSC versions {{and the second}} North American version, which contained minor changes, all used a <b>loader</b> that sometimes caused the game to freeze in specific rooms. The European PAL version resolved these glitches and contained altered elements of the gameplay to prevent sequence breaking, a slower <b>loader</b> that prevented the occasional crashes, slightly different story details, and narration in the opening and closing scenes. Some of these changes were carried over from the PAL version to the NTSC region's Player's Choice re-release, along with additional changes not made in other releases. This version, which was bundled with a silver GameCube, also contained a second disc featuring a preview trailer and a demo for Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, a timeline of Metroid games, and an art gallery.|$|E

5|$|To {{make the}} boot <b>loader</b> {{appealing}} to other operating system developers, Apple added features to allow {{flexibility in the}} booting process such as network boot using TFTP and load Mach-O and ELF formatted kernels. BootX can also boot from HFS, HFS+, UFS and ext2 formatted volumes. The boot <b>loader</b> can be manipulated at startup by holding down various key combinations to alter the booting process. Such functions include Verbose Mode, achieved by holding down the Command and V key at startup, which replaces the default Apple logo with text-based information on the boot process and Single User Mode, achieved by holding down the Command and S, which, depending on the operating system, may boot into a more basic command-line or text-based version of the operating system, to facilitate maintenance and recovery action. The ROM can also be set to require a password to access these technical functions using the OpenFirmware interface.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} design faults of the Tetrarch were {{revealed}} through its operational use. Its size limited the possible crew to three, a {{driver in the}} hull and a gunner and commander in the turret, resulting in too few crew members to operate the Tetrarch effectively. The gunner or commander, {{in addition to his}} own duties, had to act as <b>loader</b> for the 2 pounder, which caused delays in combat. A report on the tank written in January 1941 stated that as the commander had to both fight and control the tank, controlling a troop of Tetrarchs during combat would be almost impossible.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{was born}} in Dallas, Texas, to Eddie and Essie Banks on January 31, 1931; he was the second of twelve children. His father, who had worked in {{construction}} and was a warehouse <b>loader</b> for a grocery chain, played baseball for black, semi-professional teams in Texas. As a child, Banks was not very interested in baseball, preferring swimming, basketball and football. His father bought him a baseball glove for less than three dollars at a five and dime store and motivated him with nickels and dimes to play catch. His mother encouraged him to follow one of his grandfathers into {{a career as a}} minister.|$|E

5|$|Brothers Robert and Dennis Skotak {{were hired}} to {{supervise}} the visual effects, having previously worked with Cameron on several Roger Corman movies. Two stages were used to construct the colony on LV-426, using miniature models that were on average six feet tall and three feet wide. Filming the miniatures was difficult because of the weather; the wind would blow over the props; however, it proved helpful to give the effect of weather on the planet. Cameron used these miniatures and several effects to make scenes look larger than they really were, including rear projection, mirrors, beam splitters, camera splits and foreground miniatures. Due to budget limits, Cameron {{said he had to}} pay for the robotic arm used to cut into Ripley's shuttle in the opening scene. Practical effects supervisor John Richardson (who won a special effects Oscar for his part in the film) declared his biggest challenge was creating the forklift power <b>loader</b> exoskeletons, which required only three months of work and had Cameron complaining about visual details during construction. The model could not stand on its own, requiring either wires dangling from the shoulders or a pole through the back attached to a crane. While Sigourney Weaver was inside the power <b>loader</b> model, a stunt man standing behind it would move the arms and legs.|$|E
5|$|By January 1904, {{the ship}} had become the {{flagship}} of the Channel Fleet. As {{a result of a}} reorganization in January 1905, the Channel Fleet became the Atlantic Fleet, and Magnificent accordingly became a part of the Atlantic Fleet. A gun explosion aboard Magnificent on 14 June 1905 resulted in 18 casualties. The explosion was caused by a faulty shell in one of the 6-inch guns; it failed to fire, and when the <b>loader</b> opened the breech, contact with the fresh air detonated the shell. On 15 November 1906, she ended her Atlantic Fleet service and was paid off at Devonport. Magnificent was commissioned into reserve on 16 November 1906, based at Chatham. During her reserve service, she was attached to the Gunnery School at Sheerness as a gunnery training ship in December 1906.|$|E
5|$|The 37mm M5 gun had a {{manually}} operated breechblock. The tank commander doubled as <b>loader,</b> {{like many other}} tanks of the time. There was no turret basket in the M2A4 light tank; the commander stood on the right side, while the gunner stood on the left side. The commander turned the turret onto {{the general direction of}} target. The gunner would then bring the target into the M5 telescopic sight. The M20 combination mount had 20Â° of traverse; this could either be by a handwheel driving the rack and pinion traverse gear mechanism or pressure on the gunners shoulder rest overcoming the friction in the mechanism. Depression and elevation of the gun was either through a geared mechanism or, with the gears disengaged, free through movement of the gunner's shoulder rest.|$|E

5|$|The station depot {{remained}} on its concrete platform when the tracks were torn {{up on the}} old main line. In 1996, workers removed the plaque attached to the Minot monument, but it was soon returned. However, the plaque was stolen shortly afterward {{and has not been}} recovered. The station depot itself was left in decrepit condition, and in 2006, the village of Harriman's building inspector ordered Norfolk Southern Railroad (the successor to Conrail and who owned the right-of-way) to either restore the building or demolish it. Norfolk Southern followed through with a demolition permit and in May 2006, the station depot was demolished by a front <b>loader.</b> The station remains were taken to a dump in Hillburn, New York.|$|E
5|$|The 1958â59 English tour of Australia saw Davidson {{lead the}} attack {{for the first}} time in Australia. It was Australia's first series on home soil since the last English visit four years earlier and came on the back of three {{successive}} Ashes series losses. Davidson started well with match figures of 5/66 as Australia took the First Test in Brisbane by eight wickets. In the Second Test in Melbourne, Davidson took 6/64 in the first innings to help bowl out the tourists for 259 and put Australia in control. This included an opening spell in which he removed the three top order English batsmen Peter Richardson, Watson and Tom Graveney without conceding a run. He had Richardson caught behind from the first ball of his second over, before yorking Watson with the fourth ball for duck and trapping Graveney leg before wicket from the next delivery with an inswinger. This brought England captain Peter May to the crease, but Davidson'a hat-trick ball was off target and no shot was offered. He later returned to remove Colin Cowdrey, Brian Statham and Peter <b>Loader.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{decision}} {{had recently been}} made by the War Office that light tanks were no longer to be generally used in the British Army; on the whole they had performed poorly during the Battle of France and were considered to be a liability. As a result, the Vickers-Armstrong Light Tank Mk VII Tetrarch light tank was now considered obsolete. This made it available for use by the airborne forces and it was chosen by the War Office as the tank to be transported by glider. However, it had not been designed specifically as an airborne tank or to be airmobile, and it also possessed several faults. Its size limited the possible crew to threeâa driver in the hull and a gunner and commander in the turretâwhich was found to be too few crew members to operate the Tetrarch effectively. The gunner or commander, in addition to his own duties, had to act as <b>loader</b> for the 2-pounder, which caused delays in combat; a report on the tank written in January 1941 stated that since the commander had both to fight and control the tank, controlling a troop of Tetrarchs during combat would be almost impossible. The War Office was also aware that the tank had a faulty cooling system that made the Tetrarch unsuitable for service in hotter climates, such as the Middle East and North Africa.|$|E

25|$|A skid <b>loader</b> or {{skid steer}} <b>loader</b> {{is a small}} rigid frame, {{engine-powered}} machine with lift arms used to attach {{a wide variety of}} labor-saving tools or attachments. Though sometimes they are equipped with tracks, skid-steer loaders are typically four-wheel drive vehicles that can push material from one location to another, carry material in its bucket, or load material into a truck or trailer. Brothers Louis and Cyrill Keller co-invented the first skid-steer <b>loader,</b> which was based around a three-wheeled <b>loader</b> they developed in 1957 for a turkey farmer near Rothsay, Minnesota. In September 1958, they were hired by the Melroe brothers at Melroe Manufacturing Company in Gwinner, North Dakota, which was later to become Bobcat Company. Using the brothers' design, Melroe introduced the M60 Self-Propelled <b>Loader</b> and, in 1960, Louis added a rear drive axle, resulting in the M400 model, the world's first true skid-steer <b>loader.</b>|$|E
