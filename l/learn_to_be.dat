25|$|Roy Heffernan was {{a native}} Australian, born in Lithgow NSW, and was an avid {{weightlifter}} and bodybuilder in his teens. He was trained by his father, {{who was also a}} bodybuilder, and won the Mr. Australia title before making his wrestling debut at the age of twenty. Heffernan did not have an easy time moving up the ranks in Australian pro wrestling, as the belief at the time was that a wrestler really had to go overseas to North America and <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a pro before the bookers would even consider moving them up the rankings of the promotion. After working on the lower cards in Australia, Heffernan left his home country in 1953 to come to America in the hopes of attaining more success there.|$|E

25|$|Nineteen-year-old Margaret Hale happily {{returns home}} from London to the idyllic {{southern}} village of Helstone after her cousin Edith marries Captain Lennox. She lived for almost 10 {{years in the}} city with Edith and wealthy Aunt Shaw to <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a young lady. Margaret has refused an offer of marriage from the captain's brother, Henry, an up-and-comng barrister. Her life is turned upside down when her father, the local pastor, leaves the Church of England and the rectory of Helstone {{as a matter of}} conscience; his intellectual honesty has made him a dissenter.

25|$|The P-47D-16, D-20, D-22 and D-23 {{were similar}} to the P-47D-15 with minor {{improvements}} in the fuel system, engine subsystems, (the P-47D-20 introduced the R-2800-59 engine) a jettisonable canopy, and a bulletproof windshield. Beginning with the block 22 aircraft, the original narrow-chorded Curtiss propeller was replaced by propellers with larger blades, the Evansville plant switching to a new Curtiss propeller with a diameter of 13ft (3.96m) and the Long Island plant using a Hamilton Standard propeller with a diameter of 13ft 2in (4.01m). With the bigger propellers having barely 6in (152mm) of ground clearance, Thunderbolt pilots had to <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> careful on takeoffs to keep the tail down until they obtained adequate ground clearance, and on landings to flare the aircraft properly. Failure to do so damaged both the propeller and the runway. A modification to the main gear legs was installed to extend the legs via an electric motor (un-extending before retraction) to accommodate the larger propeller diameter.|$|E

Sixteen days later, he was {{signed as a free agent}} by the Colorado Rockies. The Rockies sent Navarro back down to Triple-A baseball with the Colorado Springs Sky Sox in the Pacific Coast League. He showed some improvement in Triple-A, but he was released by the Rockies a month after being signed by the team. The next day, the Cleveland Indians picked up Navarro as a free agent, and he agreed to be sent back down to AAA ball with the Buffalo Bisons in the International League, after Indians manager Charlie Manuel suggested he <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a reliever.|$|E

500|$|Adams {{works closely}} with her acting coach Warner Loughlin, and credits Loughlin for helping her {{organize}} and structure her thoughts.

Adams prefers to work with confident directors who give her space to think for herself. She stays in character while filming, and finds it difficult to detach herself from roles and accents. She is not influenced by the size of a role and is drawn towards both leading and supporting parts.
