25|$|The Xochimilco Plant Market, {{also called}} the Cuemanco Market, sits on an {{extension}} of 13 hectares of park land near the main entrance on Canal Nacional, where it crosses the Anillo Períferico Oriente. This <b>live</b> <b>plant</b> market and warehouse is the largest of its type in Latin America. It is the main moneymaking operation of the ecological park, renting out 1,700 stalls to sellers of live plants and related items, {{much the same way}} as Mexican traditional markets. Most of the sellers are producers. However, only about 600 stalls are active selling points, the rest are empty or used for storage.|$|E

Further, {{it is illegal to}} import snails (or slugs) into the U.S. without {{permission}} from the Plant Protection and Quarantine Division (PPQ), Animal Plant Health and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture.

This form should be submitted to the State regulatory official. The state will process the request and make a recommendation to APHIS who will then make a decision.|$|E
60|$|Clarence devoted {{himself to}} Emily and me, tugging my garden-chair along all the paths {{where it would}} go without too much jolting, and when I had had enough, {{exploring}} those hanging woods, either with her or on his own account. They used to come home with their hands full of flowers, and {{this resulted in a}} vehement attack of botany,-- a taste that has lasted all our lives, together with the hortus siccus to which we still make additions, though there has been a revolution there as well as everywhere else, and the Linnaean system we learnt so eagerly from Martin's Letters is altogether exploded and antiquated. Still, my sister refuses to own the scientific merits of the natural system, and can point to school-bred and lectured young ladies who have no notion how to discover the name or nature of a <b>live</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|E

60|$|And {{now think}} what a {{wonderful}} fairy tale you might write for yourself--and every word of it true--of the adventures of one atom of Potash or some other Salt, {{no bigger than a}} needle's point, in such a lava stream as I have been telling of. How it has run round and round, and will run round age after age, in an endless chain of change. How it began by being molten fire underground, how then it became part of a hard cold rock, lifted up into a cliff, beaten upon by rain and storm, and washed down into the soil of the plain, till, perhaps, the little atom of mineral met with the rootlet of some great tree, and was taken up into its sap in spring, through tiny veins, and hardened the next year into a piece of solid wood. And then how that tree was cut down, and its logs, it may be, burnt upon the hearth, till the little atom of mineral lay among the wood-ashes, and was shovelled out and thrown upon the field and washed into the soil again, and taken up by the roots of a clover plant, and became an atom of vegetable matter once more. And then how, perhaps, a rabbit came by, and ate the clover, and the grain of mineral became part of the rabbit; and then how a hawk killed that rabbit, and ate it, and so the grain became part of the hawk; and how the farmer shot the hawk, and it fell perchance into a stream, and was carried down into the sea; and when its body decayed, the little grain sank through the water, and was mingled with the mud {{at the bottom of the}} sea. But do its wanderings stop there? Not so, my child. Nothing upon this earth, as I told you once before, continues in one stay. That grain of mineral might stay at the bottom of the sea a thousand or ten thousand years, and yet the time would come when Madam How would set to work on it again. Slowly, perhaps, she would sink that mud so deep, and cover it up with so many fresh beds of mud, or sand, or lime, that under the heavy weight, and perhaps, too, under the heat of the inside of the earth, that Mud would slowly change to hard Slate Rock; and ages after, it may be, Madam How might melt that Slate Rock once more, and blast it out; and then through the mouth of a volcano the little grain of mineral might rise into the open air again to make fresh soil, as it had done thousands of years before. For Madam How can manufacture many different things out of the same materials. She may have so wrought with that grain of mineral, that she may have formed it into part of a precious stone, and men may dig it out of the rock, or pick it up in the river-bed, and polish it, and set it, and wear it. Think of that--that in the jewels which your mother or your sisters wear, or in your father's signet ring, there may be atoms which were part of a <b>live</b> <b>plant,</b> or a live animal, millions of years ago, and may be parts of a <b>live</b> <b>plant</b> or a live animal millions of years hence.|$|E

50|$|In Getz's scheme, {{words for}} miners are of Greek {{etymology}} and words for gatherers are of Latin etymology. Thus a bestivore, {{such as a}} cat, preys on live animals (Latin: bestia=animal) while a sarcophage, such as a botfly larva mines live flesh and a zontanophage (Greek: zontanos=alive), such as a leaf miner, mines <b>live</b> <b>plant</b> material. A carcasivore (Latin: carcasium=carcass), such as white-backed vulture, scavenge animal carcasses while a necrophage (Greek: nekros=dead body), such as a blowfly, mines dead flesh. Victivores (Latin: victus=living) gather <b>live</b> <b>plant</b> material and thus include frugivores, nectivores, graminivores, granivores and folivores as subcategories. Lectivores, such as many termites, gather dead plant material (Latin: lectus=bed which {{is the root of}} the word litter, as in leaf-litter) and thanatophages (Greek: thanatos=death), such as pillbugs mine piles of dead plant material. Carnivore and herbivore are generic multigroup categories for gathers respectively of animal and plant material, irrespective of whether live or dead. Croppers, scavengers, and detritivores are gatherers respectively of live, dead, and particulate material. Parasites, saprophages, and decomposers are miners respectively of live, dead, and particulate material.|$|E

50|$|As a {{viviparous}} plant, R. mangle {{creates a}} propagule {{that is in}} reality a living tree. Though resembling an elongated seed pod, the fully-grown propagule on the mangrove is capable of rooting and producing a new tree. The trees are hermaphrodites, capable of self pollination or wind pollination. The tree undergoes no dormant stage as a seed, but rather progresses to a <b>live</b> <b>plant</b> before leaving its parent tree. A mangrove propagule may float in brackish water {{for over a year}} before rooting.|$|E
5000|$|Wound and {{pathogen}} response {{appear to}} be interact negatively. For example, silencing phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), an enzyme synthesizing precursors to SA, reduces SAR but enhances herbivory resistance against insects. Similarly, overexpression of PAL enhances SAR but reduces wound response after insect herbivory. [...] Generally, {{it has been found}} that pathogens living in <b>live</b> <b>plant</b> cells are more sensitive to SA-induced defenses, while herbivorous insects and pathogens that derive benefit from cell death are more susceptible to JA defenses. Thus, this trade-off in pathways optimizes defense and saves plant resources.|$|E

50|$|Butterflies and moths play an {{important}} role in the natural ecosystem as pollinators and as food in the food chain; conversely, their larvae are considered very problematic to vegetation in agriculture, as their main source of food is often <b>live</b> <b>plant</b> matter. In many species, the female may produce from 200 to 600 eggs, while in others, the number may approach 30,000 eggs in one day. The caterpillars hatching from these eggs can cause damage to large quantities of crops. Many moth and butterfly species are of economic interest by virtue of their role as pollinators, the silk they produce, or as pest species.|$|E
