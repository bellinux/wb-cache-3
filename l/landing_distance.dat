25|$|Normal {{landings}} {{are done}} by touching all three wheels {{down at the}} same time in a three-point landing. This method does allow the shortest <b>landing</b> <b>distance</b> but can be difficult to carry out in crosswinds, as rudder control may be reduced severely before the tailwheel can become effective.|$|E
25|$|The crew, {{after finding}} the plane controllable, decided {{to fly a}} {{racetrack}} holding pattern close to Changi airport while assessing {{the status of the}} aircraft. It took 50 minutes to complete this initial assessment. The first officer and supervising check captain (SCC) then input the plane's status to the <b>landing</b> <b>distance</b> performance application (LDPA) for a landing 50 tonnes over maximum landing weight at Changi. Based on these inputs the LDPA could not calculate a <b>landing</b> <b>distance.</b> After discussion the crew elected to remove inputs related to a wet runway, in the knowledge that the runway was dry. The LDPA then returned the information that the landing was feasible with 100 metres of runway remaining. The flight then returned to Singapore Changi Airport, landing safely after the crew extended the landing gear by a gravity drop emergency extension system, at 11:45a.m. Singapore time. As a result of the aircraft landing 35 knots faster than normal, four tyres were blown.|$|E

25|$|In July 1948, Major Townsend {{started as}} the lead {{military}} pilot for the Air Force evaluation of the Boeing B-47 jet bomber. A result of B-47's sleek design, the aircraft required a high landing speed and an excessively long distance to stop. Townsend suggested {{the addition of a}} parachute, deployed shortly before touch-down, to shorten the <b>landing</b> <b>distance.</b> Equally dangerous, landing at a reduced engine power setting left the pilot unable to quickly command additional thrust due to the slow acceleration characteristics of early jet engines. A fellow B-47 test pilot, Major Russell E. Schleeh, proposed a second parachute, deployed while in the landing pattern, to permit a higher engine power setting during the approach.|$|E
500|$|Midway is {{surrounded}} by buildings and other development, so the landing thresholds of the runways are displaced to provide obstacle clearance. The FAA and the airlines ensure safety by adhering to calculated load limits and various weather minimums. Because of the displaced landing thresholds, the runways have shorter distances available for landings than for takeoffs. 13C/31C, the longest runway, only has an available <b>landing</b> <b>distance</b> of [...] in the southeast direction, and [...] to the northwest. The largest aircraft normally seen at Midway is the Boeing 757. Normally, commercial planes only take off from and land on runways 4R/22L and 13C/31C. The other runways are used by smaller aircraft.|$|E
500|$|The 35L runway at Congonhas is [...] long. Congonhas' {{counterpart}} in Rio de Janeiro, the Santos Dumont Airport, has an even shorter runway, at [...] Both airports {{receive the same}} type of traffic [...] ranging from small private planes to Boeing 737s and A320s. Many variables affect the <b>landing</b> <b>distance</b> of an aircraft, such as approach speed, weight and the presence of either a tailwind or a headwind. For an Airbus A320, a speed of just [...] higher than normal can result in as much as a 25% increase in the runway length needed to stop an aircraft. Wet weather can also significantly reduce the braking performance of aircraft, leading to an increase in the minimum runway length requirement.|$|E

500|$|The Gripen is a multirole fighter aircraft, {{intended}} as a lightweight and agile aerial platform with advanced, highly adaptable avionics. It has canard control surfaces that contribute a positive lift force at all speeds, while the generous lift from the delta wing compensates for the rear stabilizer producing negative lift at high speeds, increasing induced drag. [...] Being intentionally unstable and employing digital fly-by-wire flight controls to maintain stability removes many flight restrictions, improves maneuverability, and reduces drag. The Gripen also has good short takeoff performance, being able to maintain a high sink rate and strengthened to withstand the stresses of short landings. [...] A pair of air brakes are located {{on the sides of}} the rear fuselage; the canards also angle downward to act as air brakes and decrease <b>landing</b> <b>distance.</b> It is capable of flying at a 70–80 degrees angle of attack.|$|E
500|$|In 1944, the Sukhoi design bureau (OKB) began {{designing}} a twin-engined fighter powered by two Lyulka TR-1 turbojets, known internally as the Samolyet or Izdeliye (item or product) K. The ultimate design was very probably {{influenced by a}} captured Messerschmitt Me 262, but the Su-9 was not {{a copy of the}} German aircraft. The Su-9 had an oval cross-section, all-metal stressed skin monocoque fuselage that housed a single cockpit. The pilot was protected by armor plates to his front, an armored seat back and a bulletproof windscreen for the bubble canopy. He was provided with an ejection seat, copied from that used in the Heinkel He 162 [...] The aircraft carried a total of [...] of fuel in two bladder tanks, one each ahead and behind the pilot. The low-mounted, straight wing had a single-spar and a slight dihedral of 4°20'. The outer flaps were split and could act as air brakes. The Su-9 was the first Soviet aircraft to use hydraulic powered controls. A Soviet copy of the Junkers Jumo 004B turbojet, known as the RD-10, was hung under each wing in a streamlined nacelle. The aircraft had a tricycle undercarriage that retracted into the fuselage. The Su-9 was designed with a very high wing loading which increased the aircraft's speed and reduced its dimensions. This consequently increased the take-off and landing speeds so it was equipped with a provision for two JATO bottles (11.27kN (530lbf) thrust for 8 seconds) mounted {{on the sides of the}} fuselage. These reduced the take-off distance by nearly 50 percent and a braking parachute was fitted to reduce the <b>landing</b> <b>distance.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Series 10 {{was unique}} in the DC-9 family in not having leading edge slats. The Series 10 was {{designed}} to have short takeoff and <b>landing</b> <b>distances</b> {{without the use of}} leading edge high-lift devices. Therefore, the wing design of the Series 10 featured airfoils with extremely high maximum lift capability in order to obtain the low stalling speeds necessary for short field performance.|$|R
50|$|The faster an {{aircraft}} flies, the more lift {{can be produced}} by each unit of wing area, so a smaller wing can carry the same mass in level flight. Consequently, faster aircraft generally have higher wing loadings than slower aircraft. This increased wing loading also increases takeoff and <b>landing</b> <b>distances.</b> A higher wing loading also decreases maneuverability. The same constraints apply to winged biological organisms.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} uses retractable tricycle type {{landing gear}} by Messier-Dowty, with twin nosewheels {{and a single}} wheel on each main gear. A runway tailhook or a fairing for a brake parachute can be fitted under the tail, which can operate {{in conjunction with the}} landing gear's carbon brakes to shorten <b>landing</b> <b>distances.</b> A removable refueling probe can be attached in front of the cockpit, offset slightly to the right of centre.|$|R
