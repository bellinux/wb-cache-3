500|$|Grodziskie is {{a highly}} carbonated, <b>low-alcohol</b> <b>beer</b> with a clear, pale yellow to golden color, low to {{moderate}} levels of hop bitterness, and a moderate to medium-high smoky aroma and flavor. [...] The bright, clear, and highly carbonated appearance of Grodziskie has caused the beer to be compared with Champagne, and it is {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "Polish Champagne". Most beers that are made from wheat appear cloudy, because the final product contains suspended yeast and proteins from the wheat. [...] During the production of Grodziskie, however, the beer is filtered before it is bottled, usually by adding isinglass. [...] The filtration removes the suspended yeast and proteins, leaving a bright, clear beer. [...] When poured into a glass, it produces a large, long-lasting, tight head with small bubbles. [...] It was traditionally served in tall, conical glasses that were designed to show off the clear, golden color, as well allow a wide, thick layer of foam to form when it was poured.|$|E

40|$|The {{practice}} of dealcoholization is used nowadays {{to reduce the}} alcohol content in beverages, and osmotic distil- lation {{seems to be a}} convenient membrane process due to its mild operating conditions. The focus is on the quality of final beverage which may lack in taste, flavor, and body. The aim of this work was to evaluate the quality attributes of <b>low-alcohol</b> <b>beers,</b> dealcoholized by osmotic distillation and using strip- ping solutions specific for the beverage composition. Two types of top-fermented beer were used: Weiss beer, with a very fruity aroma and strong phenolic content, and Bitter beer, with a malt aroma. Regarding the stripping solutions, they were obtained by dilution of the original beer with water, in order to limit the volatile compound loss during the process. More- over, <b>low-alcohol</b> Weiss <b>beer</b> was also produced by using carbonated stripping solutions (i. e., saturated with CO 2 at am- bient pressure). The results highlighted that color, bitterness, total phenols, and antioxidant activity were unchanged in the <b>low-alcohol</b> <b>beers</b> but volatile compounds were reduced to a different extent. The lower vapor pressure of some volatile compounds (i. e., 2 -phenylethanol, aldehydes) can explain their retention in beer. The carbonation of stripping solutions did not significantly reduce CO 2 loss, but aldehydes and total alcohols were better retained in <b>low-alcohol</b> Weiss <b>beer.</b> Esters and other volatile compounds were reduced so that the low- alcohol beer may result with a weak sensory profile, which can be compensated by a re-addition of CO 2 before bottling...|$|R

2500|$|Iceland's {{signature}} {{alcoholic beverage}} is brennivín (literally [...] "burnt [...] wine"), {{which is similar}} in flavouring to the akvavit variant of Scandinavian brännvin. It {{is a type of}} schnapps made from distilled potatoes and flavoured with either caraway seeds or angelica. Its potency has earned it the nickname svarti dauði ("Black Death"). Modern distilleries on Iceland produce vodka (Reyka), gin (Ísafold), moss schnapps (Fjallagrasa), and a birch-flavoured schnapps and liqueur (Foss Distillery’s Birkir and Björk). Martin Miller blends Icelandic water with its England-distilled gin on the island. Strong beer was banned until 1989, so bjórlíki, a mixture of legal, <b>low-alcohol</b> pilsner <b>beer</b> and vodka, became popular. Several strong beers are now made by Icelandic breweries.|$|R
2500|$|Historically, a <b>low-alcohol,</b> {{sweetened}} <b>beer</b> {{made from}} a blend of lambic and a much lighter, freshly brewed beer to which brown sugar (or sometimes caramel or molasses) was added. The fresh beer {{was referred to as}} meertsbier, and was not necessarily a lambic. Sometimes herbs were added as well. The use of meertsbier (or water) and of substandard lambic in the blend made this a cheap, light, sweet drink for everyday consumption.

40|$|Over {{the last}} 20 years, beer {{consumption}} in Italy has greatly increased (13 lives {{per capita in}} 1975 to more than 26 litres per capita in 1995). In spite of this, beer consumption and sales in Italy are still the lowest in Europe. As a result of genetic engineering, maltsters can now use selected varieties of barley with high and homogeneous vitality, lower β-glucan content and improved enzyme potential together with brewers' malts with improved colloidal, flavour and stability. With regard to wort production, various methods have been devised to reduce the energy needs of the wort boiling process and separate the liquid (wort) from the spent grain. The evolution in genetics and yeast molecular biology {{has made it possible}} to adapt the yeast strain to the brewer's needs. This approach could lead to simplification of the brewing process. Several research laboratories have studied the possibilities of yeast immobilisation for beer fermentation and maturation and have vied to develop the system on an industrial scale. In Italy high gravity brewing has been authorised since 1990 : worts of higher than normal extract (usually by 15 - 40 %) are fermented and subsequently diluted with deoxygenated water to selling gravity before packaging, obtaining considerable energy savings. Cold sterilisation of beer has been considered as an alternative to pasteurisation in recent years. The main driving force behind this technology has been market differentiation of products and the elimination of subtle but negative taste changes possibly imparted by pasteurisation. Several factors (demand for healthy drinks, more severe drink-driving legislation, etc.) have caused considerable growth in the market for <b>low-alcohol</b> <b>beers</b> during the last few years and many production processes have been proposed to this end. These can be divided into two main groups. The first involves physical treatment of the beer to remove the ethanol produced, the second is an adaptation of existing brewing and/or fermentation processes with the aim of limiting ethanol production. The new technologies are an indispensable tool in the development of these new products...|$|R

40|$|In {{the early}} 1970 s, The Netherlands did not limit the alcohol {{consumption}} of road users. In late 1974, a legal limit of 0. 5 pm came into force, {{the police were}} given breathalyser equipment to test suspected drivers, and the blood alcohol content (BAC) test was admitted as legal. Some national campaigns against drink-driving were introduced. These measures were very effective for about a year, {{but most of the}} improvement did not last. After late 1987, breath testing carrying evidential weight was gradually introduced, and the proportion of drivers found with BAC more than 0. 5 pm decreased steadily. This is attributed to several specific policy measures from 1984 on, and to the growing popularity of <b>low-alcohol</b> and alcohol-free <b>beers</b> from 1989 on. To discover whether drink-driving can be reduced at a realistic level of police enforcement, the Leyden area was subjected to an enforcement experiment from late 1988 to late 1989. A large-scale enforcement and publicity campaign in the province of North Brabant, conducted from November 1989 to February 1990, was also evaluated. The results showed that intensive random alcohol controls by the police can significantly decrease the alcohol consumption of road users...|$|R

40|$|The purine {{contents}} of commercial, <b>low-alcohol</b> and alcohol-free <b>beers</b> were determined. Four gout sufferers were studied under controlled conditions {{before and after}} ingestion of four different beverages containing alcohol, alcohol and purine, purine and neither alcohol nor purine. The results show {{a significant increase in}} purine excretion with a fluid load alone and impairment or reversal of this response with the other three beverages. These results are difficult to interpret {{on the basis of the}} alcohol and purine {{contents of}} the beverages alone. Isohumulones are present in all beers. Their effect on urate metabolism and excretion is unknown but needs further study as a possible explanation of these results. These results suggest that the three beverages other than a fluid load alone are unsuitable for gout sufferers. KEY WORDS: Urate, Alcohol, Purines, Isohumulones. THE prophylaxis of gout with uricosurics or xanthine-oxidase inhibitors is well established. Patients who continue to imbibe alcoholic beverages however have poor control [1]. In addition, not all patients require drug agents for prophylaxis, and modification of diet in those with comparatively infrequent attacks of gout may suffice.
