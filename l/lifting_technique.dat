The present study analyses the results of ligation of intersphincteric fistula tract (<b>LIFT)</b> <b>technique</b> in treating fistula-in-ano in particular with recurrence, healing time, and continence status. Aims: LIFT {{in the management of}} patients of fistula-in-ano of cryptoglandular origin. Settings and Design: Prospective study. Materials and Methods: This is a prospective study of 52 patients admitted from September 2012 to August 2014. Patients were managed with <b>LIFT</b> <b>technique</b> and results of <b>LIFT</b> <b>technique</b> were compared with other studies in terms of recurrence rate, incontinence rate, and other postoperative complications. Results: A total of 52 patients were studied. Median follow-up was 24 weeks. Primary healing was achieved in 32 (71. 11 %) patients. Thirteen patients (28. 88 %) had a recurrence. No patient reported any subjective decrease incontinence after the procedure. Conclusions: <b>LIFT</b> <b>technique</b> is simple and easy to learn. With this method fistula-in-ano could be easily treated even at primary health care level. <b>LIFT</b> <b>technique</b> is a simple and novel modified approach for the treatment of fistula-in-ano with rapid healing rate and without any resultant incontinence...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} biomechanical {{evidence}} in support of advocating the squat <b>lifting</b> <b>technique</b> as an administrative control to prevent low back pain. BACKGROUND: Instruction with respect to <b>lifting</b> <b>technique</b> is commonly employed to prevent low back pain. The squat technique is the most widely advised <b>lifting</b> <b>technique.</b> Intervention studies failed to show health effects of this approach and consequently the rationale behind the advised lifting techniques has been questioned. METHODS: Biomechanical studies comparing the stoop and squat technique were systematically reviewed. The dependent variables used in these studies and the methods by which these were measured or estimated were ranked for validity as indicators of low back load. RESULTS: Spinal compression as indicated by intra-discal pressure and spinal shrinkage appeared not significantly different between both lifting techniques. Net moments and compression forces based on model estimates were found to be equal or somewhat higher in squat than in stoop lifting. Only when the load could be lifted from a position in between the feet did squat lifting cause lower net moments, although the studies reporting this finding had a marginal validity. Shear force and bending moments acting on the spine appeared lower in squat lifting. Net moments and compression forces during lifting reach magnitudes, that can probably cause injury, whereas shear forces and bending moments remained below injury threshold in both techniques. CONCLUSION: The biomechanical literature does not provide support for advocating the squat technique as a means of preventing low back pain. RELEVANCE: Training in <b>lifting</b> <b>technique</b> is widely used in primary and secondary prevention of low back pain, though health effects have not been proven.

40|$|Laser-Induced Forward Transfer (LIFT) is an {{important}} direct-write technique for printing of materials and devices with micron and sub-micron resolution [1, 2]. In the conventional <b>LIFT</b> <b>technique</b> the material to be printed (the donor) is coated onto a laser-transparent substrate (the carrier). A laser pulse is then focussed at the carrier-donor interface which melts or ablates the donor and transfers it onto a nearby placed substrate (the receiver) as shown in Fig. 1. The inherent disadvantage of the conventional <b>LIFT</b> <b>technique</b> is that the donor acts as its own propellant and hence gets damaged during the transfer. Many complementary <b>LIFT</b> <b>techniques</b> have been developed {{in recent years to}} avoid this damage and to achieve an intact transfer of donors in the solid phase such as Dynamic Release Layer (DRL) -LIFT [3], Ballistic Laser-Assisted Solid Transfer (BLAST) [4] and Laser Induced Thermal Imaging (LITI) [5].

40|$|The <b>lifting</b> <b>technique</b> is a {{powerful}} tool for handling the periodically time-varying nature of sampled-data systems. Yet all known solutions of sampled-data H ∞ problems are limited to the case when the feedthrough part of the lifted system, D̆ 1 : L 2 [0, h] 7 → L 2 [0, h], satisfies ‖D̆ 1 ‖ < γ, where γ is the required H ∞ performance level. While this condition is always necessary in feedback control, it might be restrictive in signal processing applications, where some amount of delay or latency between measurement and estimation can be tolerated. In this paper the sampled-data H ∞ fixed-lag smoothing problem with a smoothing lag of one sampling period is studied. The problem corresponds to the a-posteriori filtering problem in the lifted domain and is probably the simplest problem for which a smaller than ‖D̆ 1 ‖ H ∞ performance level is achievable. The necessary and sufficient solvability conditions derived in the paper are compatible with those for the sampled-data filtering problem. This result extends the scope of applicability of the <b>lifting</b> <b>technique</b> and paves the way to the application of sampled-data methods in digital signal processing.

To do so, we study the number of PGD modes required to meet a target error of 10 ^- 2 according to the diffusion coefficient c/μ, as shown in Figure 9. While classical PGD methods have difficulties to catch the right solution, minimizing the CRE leads to a better solution close to the optimal SVD one.

40|$|The Author(s) 2009. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Mixed-integer rounding (MIR) is a simple, yet powerful procedure for generating valid inequalities for mixed-integer programs. When used as cutting planes, MIR inequalities are very effective for mixed-integer programming problems with unbounded integer variables. For problems with bounded integer variables, however, cutting planes based on <b>lifting</b> <b>techniques</b> {{appear to be}} more effective. This is not surprising as <b>lifting</b> <b>techniques</b> make explicit use of the bounds on variables, whereas the MIR procedure does not. In this paper we describe a simple procedure, which we call mingling, for incorporating variable bound information into MIR. By explicitly using the variable bounds, the mingling procedure leads to strong inequalities for mixed-integer sets with bounded variables. We show that facets of mixed-integer knapsack sets derived earlier by superadditive <b>lifting</b> <b>techniques</b> can be obtained by the mingling procedure. In particular, the mingling inequalities developed in this paper subsume the continuous cover and reverse continuous cover inequalities of Marchand and Wolsey (Math Program 85 : 15 – 33, 1999) as well as the continuous integer knapsac...|$|R
