5000|$|We have {{referred}} {{in the past}} to the economy which used to be practiced by our fore-fathers. Thus, for instance, it was customary to use leeches over and over again and there are instances of infection with syphilis by leeches that had been previously used on <b>luetic</b> patients. But we believe that the everlasting cathartic pill beats everything in the line of economy. This pill was a little bullet composed of metallic antimony which had or was believed to have the property of purging as often as it was swallowed. It is not inconceivable that it might have had such property, for it is possible that a minute amount was dissolved by the gastro-intestinal juices and this amount, plus the suggestion, was sufficient to produce cathartic action. Then again the everlasting pill probably aided peristalsis by its mechanical weight and motion. The bullet was passed out, recovered from the feces and used over and over again. This, as Dr. J. A. Paris says, was economy in right earnest, for a single pill would serve a whole family during their lives and might be transmitted as an heirloom to posterity.|$|E

40|$|Since {{a proper}} {{diagnosis}} of syphilis {{is often difficult}} due to the wide variability of both clinical picture and laboratory test results, early recognition of infection caused by Treponema pallidum is crucial for a timely and effective treatment. In most cases, definitive diagnosis relies upon serological testing. A screening ELISA test, coupled with a quantitative RPR test and specific IgM antibodies detection, is currently regarded as the basic diagnostic procedure. In addition, a quantitative particle agglutination TP-PA test, FTA-abs IgG test and, eventually, a western-blot IgG and IgM test, allow to achieve a whole serological pattern for each patient {{at the time of}} first diagnosis. In this study, a group of serum samples (n= 107) and cerebro-spinal fluid (n= 3) were retrospectively analyzed using the above mentioned tests. A population of 19 patients whose clinical picture was unremarkable for syphilis, showed border-line values at screening and negative results on confirmation tests. Thirty-three out of 91 <b>luetic</b> patients were diagnosed as primary or early secondary syphilis, 36 as latent syphilis, 3 as neurosyphilis, and 3 were neonates with passive specific immunization. Quantitative RPR test and detection of specific IgM antibodies exhibited extremely high values in all 33 primary syphilis patients; a whole positive <b>luetic</b> pattern was also obtained by confirmation tests. Searching for IgM antibodies, a capture elisa test compared with a single device rapid elisa test showed an overall concordance of 98. 1 %. In <b>luetic</b> patients other than primary syphilis, quantitative RPR test and detection of specific IgM antibodies provided less relevant values and a low prevalence pattern, whereas TP-PA and FTA-abs tests showed persistent positives results. In the follow up of 19 initially treated patients, quantitative RPR values and specific IgM antibodies index showed a slow, progressive decrease until negative. Conclusion: a comprehensive initial sieroluetic framework is a relevant diagnostic tool for primary diagnosis; along the follow up, elisa screening test,TP-PA and FTA-abs IgG have a poor clinical significance; instead, quantitative RPR titers and specific IgM antibody index change over time, and as such, they are reliable tools to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of treatment and a rational management of <b>luetic</b> patients...|$|E

40|$|In {{the studies}} of {{complement}} fixation described in this paper, the antigens were prepared from (a) normal monkey red cells, (b) parasitized red cells of monkeys dying with Plasmodium knowlesi infection, (c) the spleens of monkeys dying with Plasmodium knowlesi infection; the sera came from (a) normal human beings, (b) patients with syphilis, (c) patients with paresis who were receiving malaria therapy with Plasmodium knowlesi, Plasmodium vivax, or Plasmodium falciparum, and (d) patients with malaria alone. The malarial antigens gave negative complement fixation reactions with 70 to 80 per cent of the <b>luetic</b> and normal sera and weak or doubtful reactions with the remaining 20 to 30 per cent. With {{the exception of one}} antigen prepared from spleen, {{there was no evidence that}} the malarial antigens were more reactive with Wassermann-positive than with Wassermann-negative sera. Some human sera give weak complement fixation with antigens prepared from normal monkey erythrocytes, and the percentage of these positive reactions is slightly higher with malarial sera than with normal or <b>luetic</b> sera. The most sensitive and specific malarial antigen was prepared from dried parasitized red cells by extraction with saline, freezing, and thawing. This P. knowlesi antigen gives strong complement fixation with malarial sera from human beings infected with P. knowlesi, P. vivax, or P. falciparum. The titer of complement-fixing antibodies reaches a maximum about 1 month after the beginning of the acute infection. At this time all of the P. knowlesi sera tested were positive. After 4 months the reaction diminishes rapidly in titer but may remain positive for 12 months or longer. With P. knowlesi infections in man, the complement fixation reaction remains positive for some time after the infection has apparently disappeared as judged by daily smears and inoculation of monkeys with the blood. The complement fixation reaction in malaria is group-specific rather than species-specific. Sera from patients infected with P. vivax or P. falciparum react in the same way with the P. knowlesi antigen as the homologous sera. Absorption of malarial human sera with normal monkey erythrocytes does not remove the immune bodies which fix complement with malarial antigens...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{long-term}} changes and shorter-term variability in monthly, seasonal, and arL' 1 ual discharge between 1882 and 2004 of two rivers, the Severnaya Dvina (SD) and the Sukhona (SU), draining north-western Russia, and links these changes to climatic variability. The Severnaya Dvina {{is one of}} the largest rivers of the <b>lUetic</b> Ocean basin and changes in its discharge can potentially affect the Thermohaline Circulation. The SU is a tributary to SD and results have been used to corroborate findings obtained for SD. It has been suggested by previous studies that discharge of the rivers draining the Eurasian sector of the Arctic basin has significantly increased. However, these studies started during one afthe warmest and driest periods on record in the 930 s. Analysis of the discharge records of the SD and the SU has shown that that there has been no long-term, linear change in discharge. Strong interdecadal variability characterises both records and a number of significant shifts from lower to higher discharge occurs. The early part of the records (1882 - the early 1930 s) is characterised by high annual discharge with many strong positive anomalies. A period of low discharge started in the dry 1930 s and continued until the early 1970 s. The last decades were characterised by average annual discharge. The main implication from this study is that freshwater inflow trom European Russia into the Arctic Ocean has not changed since 1882. Oscillations in regional climate and large-scale atmospheric circulation (telecop [...] nection patterns) drive discharge variability. There are close causal links between variability in regional precipitation, air temperature, snow cover, evaporation, and discharge. Variability in teleconnection indices (most importantly North Atlantic Oscillation, Scandinavian and East Atlantic Jet pattern) explains between 13 % (summer) and 48 % (winter) variance in seasonal discharge.

40|$|THROMBOSIS of the basilar artery is {{regarded}} as rare, and its clinical diagnosis difficult. The first mention of clinical cases to have been anatomically verified are those of Leyden (1875) who described 2 cases both due to syphilitic <b>luetic</b> endarteritis. Marburg (1911) published a clinical and anatomical analysis and tried to differentiate between an occlusion of the oral-, middle- and caudal part of the basilar artery, an attempt which {{in the light of}} our present knowledge was unsuccessful. Pines and Gilinsky (1932) were the first to publish a case in which the brain-stem was examined in serial sections. Meantime it had been proved that occlusion of the basilar artery might be caused not only by syphilis but as often, if not more frequently, by arteriosclerosis. Lhermitte and Trelles (1934) pointed out that of all the cerebral vessels the basilar artery is the most frequently affected by arteriosclerosis. In their case-histories the only cases showed uni- or bilateral-paramedian areas of softening, caused by thrombosis of the lateral branches of the basilar artery, and not occlusion of the main vessel itself. Kubik and Adams (1946), from the post-mortem material of two hospitals in Boston, collected 25 cases of occlusion of the basilar artery, found once in a series of 300 post-mortem examinations. In 7 of these cases no clinical data were available. The other 18 cases, of which 11 were due to thrombosis and 7 of embolic nature, were described in an extensive clinico-anatomical study. In each case the extent of the occluding thrombus or embolus was carefully noted, and also the limitation of the consequent areas of softening in the brain-stem. The only defect is that these areas were mainly assessed by macroscopical appearances, no single case being cut in serial sections. The clinical data lacked completeness. Notwithstanding this, the range of material is impressive and it is clear that occlusion of the basilar artery occurs more frequently than previously supposed.

40|$|Introduction: The {{clinical}} diagnosis of syphilis is always supported by appropriate laboratory tests {{and the test}} results are interpreted {{with reference to the}} patient’s history. In the diagnosis of syphilis, the use of tests based on antibody search that recognize both treponemal and reaginic antigens increases the diagnostic chances. Our study discusses the various serological and alternative tests currently available along with their limitations, and relates their results to the likely corresponding clinical stage of the disease. Methods: in our laboratory were analyzed 264 sera and 4 liquor (123 Females, 145 Males). 187 patients are subject at low risk for <b>luetic</b> infection, including pregnant woman, patient with organ transplant, outpatients or hospitalized undergoing routine serological, and 81 from patients with confirmed syphilis including 4 pregnant women in antibiotic treatment, patients with suspected disease, HIV positive and patients with autoimmune diseases with Cardiolipin positive. All sera were tested with ELISA Anti-Treponema pallidum Screen (IgG / IgM) and in parallel with agglutination tests VDRL and TPHA. On all positive sera was tested Euroline-WB EUROIMMUN and reading done with the program EuroLineScan. Results: by ELISA Anti-Treponema pallidum Screen IgG / IgM 162 sera were negative and 106 sera positive (39. 5 %), distributed as follows: 45 (42 %) with a value greater than 200 RU / ml, 43 (41 %) with a value> 22 RU / ml and 18 (17 %) with a borderline value between> 16 to < 22 RU / ml. The execution of the Blot IgG showed: 18 negative sera, 6 with borderline value with one only band of specific antigens (p 15, p 45, p 47 or p 17), while 82, including 4 liquor (neurolue), were certainly positive showing more than one band antibody to the treponemal antigens. Only one patient had in place at the time of screening, an initial infection; in fact, there was a single clear positivity in the IgM protein bands, while 7 sera was uncertain values. It is reported 11 positivity for IgM Cardiolipin, while Cardiolipin IgG was detected with a high positivity in 34 sera. The presence of borderline values and / or positivity for a single protein band can be attributed to a unspecific reaction caused by autoimmune diseases or related cross-reactions with other Spirochete or to other Borrelia. Conclusions: The immunoblot test gave useful information at epidemiological and clinical level. The deepening with a confirmation test with proteic antigens and cardiolipin identifies false reactivity, but also indicates the specific reactivity to past infection and a better characteriation in the different stages of disease. In our study in the latent forms there are relevant discrepancies among the various tests. Compare to traditional methods, anti-cardiolipin antibodies positivity in our confirmatory test has the advantage of providing non subjective interpretation, being based upon the EuroLineScan program...|$|E
40|$|Foram estudados 27 pacientes submetidos a implante de tubo de Dacron valvulado (segundo técnica de Bentall-De Bono), entre 1976 e 1985. Todos apresentavam ectasia ânulo-aórtica, que era devida a necrose cística da média em 23 pacientes (85, 2 %), dissecção crônica de aorta em 3 pacientes (11, 1 %) e aortite luética em 1 paciente (3, 7 %). A faixa etária foi de 29 a 64 anos (m = 48 anos). Três eram do sexo feminino e 24, do masculino. Foi utilizado tubo de Dacron 28 ou 30 mm em todos. As válvulas utilizadas foram: de dura-máter em 7 pacientes, de aorta heteróloga em 9 e metálica em 11 pacientes. A classe funcional era I-II em 7 pacientes e III-IV em 19 pacientes (NYHA). Houve 1 óbito (3, 7 %) pós-operatório imediato, por sangramento incontrolável e insuficiência renal aguda. As complicações mais freqüentes foram arritmias (13 pacientes, 48 %) e hemorragia (3 pacientes, 11 %). No pós-operatório tardio faleceram 9 pacientes, pelas seguintes causas: morte súbita (2 pacientes, 7, 4 %), insuficiência cardíaca aguda (2 pacientes, 7, 4 %), hemorragia após reoperação (1 paciente, 3, 7 %), infecção hospitalar (1 paciente, 3, 7 %), endocardite infecciosa (1 paciente, 3, 7 %) e causa acidental (7, 4 %). Cinco pacientes (18, 5 %) foram reoperados no pós-operatório tardio, 2 por disfunção de prótese, 2 por endocardite infecciosa sobre tubo de Dacron e 1 por fístula perivalvular. A curva atuarial mostrou uma probabilidade de sobrevida de 83, 7 % até o 3 ? ano, 61 % aos 5 anos e 42, 7 % do 6 º ao 9 º ano. No fim do período, os 17 pacientes sobreviventes encontram-se em classe funcional I-II (p This is {{a report}} of 27 {{patients}} presenting annulo-aortic ectasia submitted to surgical correction with a composite valve-tube graft (Bentall-De Bono technique), between 1976 and 1985. Twenty three (85. 2 %) had cystic medial necrosis, 3 (11, 1 %) were chronic aortic disections and 1 (3. 7 %) was <b>luetic</b> aortitis. Age ranged from 29 to 64 years (m = 48). Three were female and 24 male patients. The valves used were homologous dura maier in 7 cases, heterologous aorta in 9 and mechanical prosthesis in 11. Functional class (NYHA) was I-II in 7 and III-IV in 9 patients. There was 1 (3. 7 %) hospital death, due to bleeding and renal failure. Significant early complications were represented by arrhythmias in 13 cases (48 %) and bleeding in 3 (11 %). In the late follow-up therev. were 9 deaths, due to: sudden death (2 patients, 7. 4 %), bleeding in reoperation (1 patient, 3. 7 %), hospital infection (1 patient, 3. 7 %), infectious endocarditis (1 patient, 3. 7 %) and accidental causes (2 patients, 7. 4 %). Five patients (18. 5 %) needed reoperation in the late follow-up: 2 due to bioprosthetic failure, 2 for replacement of an infected Dacron tube and 1 for repair of pseudo-aneurysm and periprosthetic leak. The actuarial survival curve showed a probability of 83. 7 % up to the 3 rd. year, 61 % for the 5 th. year and 42. 7 % from the 6 th. to the 9 th. year of follow-up. The 17 patients surviving are in functional class I-II (NYHA). The composite valve-Dacron tube graft (Bentall-De Bono) technique for correction of annulo-aortic ectasia {{is associated with a}} low hospital mortality. The improvement in functional class is significant. There have been a small number of complications and the long term survival is very satisfactory...|$|E
40|$|Ischemic cardiac {{patients}} {{with or without}} pain were divided into three main groups by the modification of Ross 2 ̆ 7 classification with special reference to clinical symptoms, laboratory results, electrocardiographic as well as vectorcardiographic findings, cardiovascular dynamical values and patho-anatomical examinations. On the other hand, this classification was compared with that presented by WHO in 1962. In this paper there was kept account on intermediate types {{in the sense of}} WHO (I. T.) which is supposed to be situated between exertional angina pectoris (A. P.) and myocardial infarction (M. I.). These three abbreviations described here are strictly meant by three sorts of the respective ischemic heart diseases (I. H. D.) defined by the WHO recommendation, since baseball without ground rule is quite nonsensical. The significance of I. T. has remained, however, still uncertain and has become a source of contraversy; accordingly I. T. involves at present a lot of various synonyms depending on different authors 2 ̆ 7 opinions, for example, definition of Vakil or Prinzmetal. 1. In the light of Ross, the ischemic heart diseases complicated with cardiac pains could be also divided into three groups chiefly according to the types of attacks. In the group I, the duration of the attack was usually within five minutes; nitroglycerine was proven effective in favour. In the group III, the duration of the attack was longer than one hour; nitroglycerine was refractory against the attack; in addition, shock of various severity was occasionally complicated. The group II was intermediately situated between the former two groups. 2. In the group II, nitroglycerine was proven also fairly effective nearly in one half of the cases. The rate of occurrence of myocardial necrotic signs suggested from those of changes in serum fermentative reactions, blood sedimentation rate, white cell number and fever etc. was again intermediately observed between those in the group I and III. Consequently as far as the modification of Ross 2 ̆ 7 classification is concerned, the clinical and laboratory findings were usually supposed in parallel with the severity of attacks. Regarding prognosis, the rate of recovery was, without mention, better in the group I than in the group II and III; at least respecting the hospitalized subjects here observed the mortality in the group III did not so strikingly exceed that in the group II. 3. Electrocardiographically there existed the significant difference of αQRS, αT and G/R between the group I and II. Vectorcardiographically there existed also roughly the same tendency as being found electrocardiographically; that is, as the anginal symptoms became severe, the initial vector of QRS in horizontal plane turned posteriorly and the T vector was displaced dextro-anteriorly. Regarding _SVG, there appeared the decrease in _ T and SG/SR. These changes in Ecg and Vcg were seemed to furnish with useful informations about any sort of classifications of ischemic heart diseases, for example, the two-peaked T in V, without ST-T change in V_ occasionally experienced among such patients as belonging to the group II. 4. In ischemic heart patients whose conditions allowed to perform the circulatory analysis, no marked decrease in stroke and minute volumes could be estimated on an average. The prolongation of tension time ASZ and the diminution of ejection time ATZ, that is, the tendency to pressure reaction in the sense of Blumberger displayed more strikingly in the group II and III than in the group I. 5. According to the classification recommended by WHO, most of the {{patients with}} A. P. belonged to the above-mentioned group I and 80 per cent of the patients with M. I. to the group III. There existed, however, a minority of patients with M. I. belonging to thegroup I or II. The patients with I. T. defined by WHO could be seen {{in each of the three}} sorts of the groups classified by the modification of Ross 2 ̆ 7 method. In the group II there could not be observed any case of A. P., but some patients with I. T. or M. I. in the sense of WHO could be seen, though the cases of M. I. remained only a few. The group III of ischemic heart diseases defined by the modified Ross 2 ̆ 7 method corresponded, for the most part, to M. I. defined by WHO, though the patients in this group did not necessarily show any sign of myocardial necrosis. The recommendation of WHO emphasized that A. P. is of exertional nature; there could, however, be seen not only eleven per cent of I. T., but also thirty per cent of M. I.; while nitroglycerine was proven refractory in all of M. I., it was found effective in one-third of I. T. As to the hospitalized patients here observed, the mortality was estimated zero per cent in A. P., 16. 6 per cent of in I. T. and 15. 9 per cent of M. I. respectively. The myocardial necrotic signs in I. T. appeared at the intermediate rate between A. P. and M. I. 6. In I. T., the intrinsicoid deflection showed the intermediate delay between A. P. and M. I.; VG of I. T., however, did nod display any pathognomonic change. There could be observed vectorcardiographically the posterior displacement of the initial vector of QRS and the change in T vector, as mentioned in the group II; these findings could be also assured in I. T. The cardiovascular dynamical values found in each of the subdivisions of I. H. D. according to the classification of WHO showed more or less clear difference from those in normal health on an average, but there existed no characteristic feature of the change in circulatory dynamical values among the subdivisions of I. H. D. 7. The patho-anatomical findings of I. H. D. Respecting the coronary arterial sclerosis, there could not be observed any pathognomonic pattern corresponding to the subdivisions of I. H. D., whereas regarding the changes in myocardium there could be consistently seen the dissemination of small myomalacia with or without microthrombosis and small myocardial fibrosis at the autopsy of the group I and II. Except for one cases (No. 40) in this observation, all of the other patients belonging to the group III showed the typical myocardial infarction. There existed no autopsy of A. P. classified by WHO. Two cases of I. T. showed the coronary arteriosclerosis, the other one the rheumatic occlusive coronaritis as one of the manifestations of the generalized rheumatic angiitis and the last the coronary angiitis in systemic lupus erythematosus, while neither localisation nor severity of the patho-anatomical finding could be assured respecting coronary stenosis found in I. T.; that is, the disseminated myocardial lesions could be observed in each of the patients with I. T. In M. I. according to WHO classification, there could be not rarely seen such cases as showing diffuse disseminated, small changes in myocardium, instead of massive localized infarction. Thus there exist some disagreement between clinical classifications heretofore published and patho-anatomical findings, especially it remains still difficult clinically to grasp the patho-anatomical meaning in I. T. 8. The casuistic reports were described as follows: a. I. T. : i. Prinzmetal 2 ̆ 7 s variant form, especially involved in posterior cardiac wall, ii. Prinzmetal 2 ̆ 7 s variant form, especially involved in anterior cardiac wall, iii. The myocardial fibrosis, dead of sudden death, complicated with so-called cardio-cerebral symptom-complex, left bundle branch block and congestive heart failure in the course of the recurrent acute coronary failure in the typical sense of Blumgart. iv. The acute coronary failure, complicated severe shock symptoms, missing any gross change in coronary system at autopsy. b. Special cases of M. I. : i. Coronary involvement in the course of Niemann-Pick 2 ̆ 7 s lipoidosis complicated with various sorts of neurological symptoms. ii. Diffuse rheumatic occlusive coronaritis and fresh atrial infarction in mitralstenoinsufficiency. iii. The patient with the diffuse disseminated small myocardial scarrs and infarctional cardiac aneurysma found at autopsy, who was suddenly dead of the stenosis of the coronary stem due to <b>luetic</b> aortitis showing the anterior QRS pattern persisting two months long after the first marked attack. c. Sudden death due to the coronary angiitis in systemic lupus erythematosus. d. Among so-called silent or painless I. H. D. according to the classification of WHO, the following casuistic cases were described. i. Temporal, but considerably long-standing left bundle branch block, ii. Old high lateral infarction found in the course of the rheumatic heart disease, iii. Coronary angiitis observed in the panangiitis nodosa suddenly dead of acute haemothorax. iv. Severe myocardial involvement of a patient with Behget 2 ̆ 7 s disease, v. Coronary sclerosis complicated systemic amyloidosis with right bundle branch block (sudden death) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{histological}} {{changes of}} the brain and of the other organs of the patient who was admited to the Psycopathic Hospital de la Magdalena del Mar, has been studied. The patient was admited to the hospital thirty years ago with the diagnosis of Demencia Precox. The discharge diagnosis was Maniac Psychosis. The examination showed lesions of <b>Luetic</b> endoarteritis of the small vessels of the cortex, an entity which was first studied in 1903 by Nissl and Alzheimer. It has been demostrated alterations in the vessels, meninqes, ganglion cells, and gliotic elements of the brain, and structural {{changes of the}} other organs. The predominant changes in the meninges are of a chronic and acute character. The former are old "alterations together with vascular sclerosis. The latter are peri-vascular infiltrations of phagocitic wandering cells in which it is frequent to find dense el elements of angular contours with a very rare or no nuclear bodies. This same cells are Frequent in the infiltrations of other organs, such as the Iiver. The dominant character of the typical vascular injury is the proliferation of the adventicial and endothelial cells. It is not unusual, specially in the vessels of large caliber to find alterations of a degenerative nature in the middle layer; these being as a rule of and sclerotic or hialine nature. In these vessels it is quite frequent to find the presence of proliferative and degenerative changes in the intima. The same vascular injuries are found in other organs like the uterus, adrenals, liver etc. Sclerotic changes have been proved to exist in the uterus; calcic concretions and complete calcic occlusions have been found in the vessels of Gasserian ganglion and in the csorcid plexus: hialine degenerations in the media of many vessels of the brain, adrenals, ovary and uterus; and endothelial bridges in the vessels of the ovary are also present. All this shows that the vascular alteration was of a general character. There are two kinds of alterations in ganglion cells, some due to alterations in the vessels and in close relation with these: the necrotic perivascular alterations: others are independent and far related with them: the systematic changes. The exclusive les ion of the cells of the IIIth plate of the cortex (Fig. Nr. 14 and 15) belong to this class, as it is the loss of the Purkinje cells and the deep necrotic changes of nucleus dentatus of the cerebellum. The parts that have a general vulnerability have been intensly affected such as the Cornu Ammonis. Not only in its constitutive insulated elements but also in its architecture. showing considerable changes (Fig. Nr 50). There is evident necrosis of the cells of the spinal cord, specially of the nucleeus propius cornu enterioris and of the nucleus myorabdoticus leterelis, many of these elements. specially those of the first group have disapeared. It is interest to note that some of these changes have not shown relation with the correspondent clinical manifestations. At least until a few before the patient died there were no symptoms of cerebellum or of spinal cord involvement. In adition {{it must be noted that}} in the cerebellum there was alterations of basket fibers which gives a resembles with the heredo-cerebellar ataxia of which cerebellar modifications are seperated because the organ mantein the granular layer undemne. Cerebellum changes are common in the desease. It is known that syphilis in all its diferent forms involves large sections of the cerebellum, sometimes entire lobules. With the use of the silver stein of DEL RIO HORTEGA it has been possible to make it easily visible both in the regions of the cortex as well as in the medula oblongata and other formations the most interesant gliotic formations of the astrocytic type, specialy in the periphery of the capilars where the perivascular gliotic rings have been intensly developed. AIso nets of glia of the most complicated weaves and elements have been found in different regions of the nervus systern. The histological examination has confirmed the long believed suposition that the architectural glia of the cortex is heterogeneus and therefore different in its defensive reactions. It would be advisable to study this point both in the normal and patological state. Diferently to what happenes in the general paralysis or in the acute process of syphilis. the microglial reaction has been practical null. The astrocyts has been the prevaling element: this change seems to go with a chronic state of the disease. lt has been found in the dorsal surface of the medula oblongata bodies of the “corpora amilacea" and certain degenerated states of the ganglion cells of the nucleus magnocellularis fumculi posterioris, sustantia reticulatis grisea, nucleus ambigues and nucleus arcuatus, beside gliotic neurophagic nodes. In the ventricles an exudative and proliferative ependimitis has taken place and subependym gliotic elements have penetrated in the inside of the cavity mixing themselves with the morphologic elements of the exudate. At least in some places there is a complete destruction of the ependimary fences; such alterations have often been observed in diferent cases of siphilis. 0 ther organs beside the brain have been submited to a close study to determinate its pathological changes in the malady. A large number of the vessels have shown the same alteration as those of the brain, that is adventitial and endotelial proliferation, and degenerated changes in the media of the vessels of medium size. Together with these alterations and as its result, necrosis and degenerations of various kinds have been found in other organs such as the degenerative changes of the parenchyma of the liver and spleen, and of the cells and fibers of the Gasserian ganglion depending these last ones, as it can be seen in the photographs of a calcifing process in the capillairies. It is observed in the liver the different fases of a conective peribiliar proliferation which tend to close the biliar duct, and the particular reaction of the Kuppffer cells. (Fig. N° 64). In the hypophysis, a great increase of the fibrous components, can be seen. Clinically the disease was of a chronic nature: its symptoms of a maniatic Psychosis. The inmediatly cause of death was heart failure; the most notable aspect from the psiquic point of view was the contribution presented by the patient hability to recite a remarkable number of songs of national folklore, old refrains which she was able to remember with extremly fidelity to the last. Se estudia las alteraciones histológicas del cerebro y de los órganos extracerebrales de una enferma que permaneció treinta años en el hospital psiquiátrico de Magdalena del Mar con el diagnóstico de psicosis maniaca, diagnóstico que fué a su ingreso de demencia precoz. El examen muestra que el cambio dominante en el cerebro es la endarteritis de los pequeños vasos de la corteza, tipo endarteritis sifilítica, entidad estudiada por primera vez por NISSL y ALZHEIMER en 1903. Han sido comprobadas alteraciones en los vasos, pía, elementos ganglionares y glióticos, del cerebro, y modificaciones estructurales en los órganos extracerebrales. En la pía dominan los cambios de carácter crónico y agudo. Al primero corresponden viejas alteraciones meningeas en concomitancia, corrientemente, con esclerosis vasculares; al segundo, los infiltrados perivasculares de células de inflamación en los que es frecuente hallar elementos densos de contorno anguloso, con escasa o ninguna evidencia de cuerpo nuclear, de franca cepa conectiva, y muy frecuente también en los infiltrados de otros órganos, del hígado por ejemplo. Carácter dominante de la lesión típica vascular es la proliferación adventicial y endotelial. No es raro encontrar sobre todo en los vasos de calibre mayor, alteraciones degenerativas de la capa media, de carácter hialino o escleroso. En vasos de mayor dimensión es frecuente la presencia de lesiones proliferativas y degenerativas de la íntima. Las mismas lesiones vasculares se hallan en órganos extracerebrales como el útero, cápsulas suprarrenales, hígado, etc. Lesiones de carácter escleroso han sido comprobados en el útero; concreciones y totales oclusiones cálcicas en los vasos del ganglio de Gasser y los plexos coroides; degeneraciones hialinas en la capa media de los vasos medianos en el cerebro, cápsulas suprarrenales, ovario y útero; y, puentes endoteliales en el ovario, todo lo que acusa que el cambio vascular ha tenido carácter general. Hay dos clases de alteraciones ganglionares : unas dependientes de las lesiones de los vasos y en inmediata relación con éstos, las necrosis y alteraciones individuales celulares perivasculares; otras, independientes y muy alejados de los mismos: los cambios sistemáticos. El compromiso exclusivo de las células de la III~ lámina de la corteza (Figs. Nos. 14 y 15), pertenece a esta categoría, lo mismo que la desaparición de las células de Purkinje y las alteraciones necróticas del nucleus dentatus del cerebelo. Territorios que poseen una vulnerabilidad general han sido intensamente comprometidos, como el asta de Ammon. No sólo, aisladamente sus elementos constitutivos, sino su arquitectura muestran considerables cambios: Fig. No. 50. Hay evidente necrosis de grupos celulares de la médula espinal, principalmente del n. proprius cornu anterioris y del n. myorabdoticus lateralis, muchos de cuyos elementos, sobre todo del primero, han desaparecido. Interesante es que estos cambios no han guardado relación con manifestaciones clínicas correspondientes. En ningún momento por lo menos hasta pocos días antes de su muerte, presentó la enferma síntomas cerebelosos o medulares. Además en el cerebelo hay alteraciones de las fibras del canastillo, lo que le da un cierto parecido con la heredo-ataxia cerebelosa, de cuyas modificaciones cerebelosos se aparta por conservarse indemne la capa granulosa. Las alteraciones cerebelosas no son propias de la enfermedad. Es sabido que la sífilis en sus diferentes formas compromete extensos territorios del órgano, a veces lóbulos íntegros. Mediante el empleo de los procedimientos argénticos de DEL RIO HORTEGA se ha logrado hacer visibles tanto en los más apartados territorios de la corteza, como en el bulbo y otras formaciones nerviosas, las más diversas e interesantes formaciones glióticas de tipo astrocitario, sobre todo, en la periferie de los capilares donde se ha desarrollado con particular intensidad los típicos anillos glióticos perivasculares. Además redes de glía de las más variadas tramas, y elementos de esta especie de la mayor diversidad, han sido hallados en distintos territorios del sistema nervioso. El examen histológico confirma la suposición hace mucho tiempo sostenida de ser heterogénea la arquitectura gliótica de la corteza, y, como consecuencia distinta su manera reaccional frente a los agentes alterantes. Convendría estudiar este punto en lo normal y en lo patológico. Al contrario de lo que ocurre en la parálisis general o en procesos sifilíticos de curso agudo, la reacción microglial ha sido casi nula. El astrocito ha sido el elemento dominante, cambio que parece aparejarse con el carácter crónico de la enfermedad. Se ha comprobado en el bulbo: cuerpos amiláceos en las vecindades de la superficie del 4 º ventrículo y particulares estados degenerativos de los elementos ganglionares de los núcleos : magno cellularis funiculi posterioris, sustancia reticularís grisea, n. ambiguos, y n. arcuatus. Además nódulos glióticos neuronofágicos. En los ventrículos internos se ha desarrollado una ependimitis proliferativa y exudativa, en muchos sitios ha sido rota la barrera ependimaria, y elementos glióticos subependimarios han hecho su irrupción en la cavidad interna mezclándose con los componentes morfológicos del exudado. Por último en algunos lugares ha sido destruida la barrera ependimaria. Semejantes alteraciones han sido descritas en diversas clases de sífilis. Se ha estudiado diversos órganos extracerebrales con el propósito de averiguar su repercusión en el proceso. Gran parte de los vasos presentan las mismas alteraciones que los del cerebro, esto es las proliferaciones endo y adventiciales, pero aparte de éstas es frecuente hallar cambios degenerativos de la capa media de los de mediano calibre. Junto con tales alteraciones y como su consecuencia, necrosis y degeneraciones de la más variada índole se han hecho presentes en diversos órganos, como las insulares del parénquima hepático y del bazo, las de las células y fibras del ganglio de Gasser, dependientes estas últimas como se ve en las fotografías respectivas, de procesos calcificantes oclusivos de los capilares. Se estudia en el hígado las fases de una proliferación conectiva peribiliar, con tendencia oclusiva por estrechamiento de la luz canalicular; y la particular reacción de las células de Kupffer. Fig. No. 64. Eh la hipófisis se comprueba un desarrollo considerable del componente fibroso que "ahoga" islotes glandulares. CIÍnicamente el curso de la enfermedad fué crónico; sus síntomas los d~ una psicosis maniaca; la causa inmediata de la muerte una cardiopatía rápidamente descompensada; lo más notable en el aspecto psíquico la contribución presentada por la enferma al enriquecimiento del folk-lore nacional por la suma de cantares, consejas y refranes que su memoria había por felicidad conservado...|$|E
