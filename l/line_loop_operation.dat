40|$|In {{the last}} years, high {{penetration}} of distributed generation (DG) has strongly affected public MV networks. In {{order to improve}} their reliability and availability, <b>loop</b> <b>operation</b> is being tested. This solution requires the installation of new line protection devices and the identification of appropriate settings against phase-to-phase and ground faults. This study refers to an experimental <b>loop</b> <b>line</b> operated by ENEL Distribuzione, the largest Italian Distribution System Operator (DSO). The paper deals with {{the behavior of the}} currently installed line protection during cross-country faults (CCFs), occurring both in radial and <b>loop</b> <b>lines.</b> MV network response has been preliminary evaluated by approximated formula (which allow a fast check of line protection performances), and then verified by accurate simulations based on a detailed Simulink network model. CCFs occurring inside and outside the <b>loop</b> <b>line</b> have been analyzed. Obtained results show that the zero-sequence and phase directional overcurrent (Blocking-Scheme supported) are generally able to selectively identify and clear CCFs. Nevertheless, if CCFs occur in the same overhead stretch of the <b>loop</b> <b>line,</b> the adopted protection scheme may fail...|$|R
50|$|Balloon <b>loops</b> enable higher <b>line</b> {{capacity}} (faster turnaround of {{a larger}} number of trams) and also allow the use of single-ended trams which have several advantages, including lower cost and more seating when doors are on one side only. However, double-ended trams also benefit from the capacity advantage of balloon loops, for example on the former Sydney tram system where loops were used from 1881 until the system's closure in 1961. Initially the Sydney system was operated by single-ended steam trams and then, from the 1890s, by double-ended electric trams. <b>Lines</b> were <b>looped</b> in the Sydney CBD and the other busiest areas of operation, such as the La Perouse, New South Wales and other eastern suburbs lines, as they provided greater turn-around capacity on this very busy system. The Sydney system was possibly the first major example of a looped tramway system. European systems were extensively converted to <b>looped</b> <b>operation</b> {{in the early twentieth century}} and most of them changed to single-ended trams. <b>Looped</b> <b>operation</b> with single-ended trams was also used on many North American streetcar systems.|$|R

30|$|If {{the initial}} {{subspace}} is good (e.g., {{created by the}} OOCMP algorithm), then, in most cases, there are no substitutions at all (the outer <b>loop</b> <b>operations</b> are performed only once). If the initial subspace is poor (e.g., randomly chosen), the outer <b>loop</b> <b>operations</b> are performed many times and the algorithm becomes computationally complex. Moreover, this algorithm stops in some suboptimal subspace (it is not equivalent to the full search algorithm), and it is therefore, important to start from a good initial subspace. The final subspace is, in any case, not worse than the initial one and the algorithm may be stopped at any time.|$|R
