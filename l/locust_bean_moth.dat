5000|$|Until recently, {{the only}} current of {{controlling}} <b>locust</b> <b>bean</b> <b>moth</b> was malathion dusting, {{three or four}} times per growing season. Because of the height of the palm trees (sometimes over 50 ft), commercial treatments were applied exclusively by powerful dusting equipment that delivers the insecticidal dust through a hand-directed tube. This produces a “fog” of insecticide during application that essentially blankets the ground with malathion, which is wasteful and creates unintended nontarget effects on other animal species, as well as [...] "environmental pollution". Furthermore, the accumulation of the malathion dust on the skin of dates creates problems with desiccation of the fruit, reducing the overall quality of the product. Encroachment of date gardens and urban areas has been forcing the California date producers to move away from malathion dusting, but until recently, no other alternatives for <b>locust</b> <b>bean</b> <b>moth</b> control were available.|$|E

The effect of <b>locust</b> <b>bean</b> gum on the viscoelastic properties of the mixture was dependent on the degree of side-chain substitution of the galactomannan, ionic environment, temperature and the composition of the mixture. <b>Locust</b> <b>bean</b> gums, with mannose to galactose ratios of ~ 3 (lbg 3) and ~ 5 (lbg 5), have been evaluated. For the mixture of xanthan-locust bean gum, viscoelastic measurements showed that, when the polymers were mixed at room temperature, a gel is formed.
