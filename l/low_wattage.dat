2500|$|Instrument {{amplifiers}} {{are available}} {{in a wide range}} of price, quality, and performance levels. Some are designed for beginners, such as small, low-wattage practice amps, which typically have a single 8" [...] speaker and about 10 watts, or smaller [...] "combo" [...] amps with relatively <b>low</b> <b>wattage</b> (15 to 20 watts) and a single 10" [...] speaker. Mid- to large-size [...] "combo" [...] amps with 30 to 50 watts and one 12" [...] speaker or four 10" [...] speakers are best for high-volume situations, such as band rehearsals and onstage performances. For large venues, such as outdoor music festivals, guitarists may use one or more 100 watt (or several hundred watt) heads with one or more 8x10” cabinets. Some guitar amps are strongly associated with specific instruments or genres, such as the Marshall amps, which are widely used in heavy metal music.|$|E

5000|$|Use the <b>lowest</b> <b>wattage</b> of lamp that is feasible. The maximum wattage {{for most}} {{commercial}} applications should be 250 watts of high intensity discharge lighting, but less is usually sufficient.|$|R
25|$|The use of full cutoff {{fixtures}} {{can allow}} for lower wattage lamps {{to be used}} in the fixtures, producing the same or sometimes a better effect, due to being more carefully controlled. In every lighting system, some sky glow also results from light reflected from the ground. This reflection can be reduced, however, by being careful to use only the <b>lowest</b> <b>wattage</b> necessary for the lamp, and setting spacing between lights appropriately. Assuring luminaire setback is greater than 90° from highly reflective surfaces also diminishes reflectance.|$|R
50|$|The station's call letters {{reflect the}} Globe Gazette newspaper. The station began {{broadcasting}} in 1938 on the assigned frequency of 1210 kHz. It {{was owned by}} Lee Broadcasting, {{a subsidiary of the}} owner of the Globe Gazette, Lee Enterprises. The founding general manager of KGLO and Lee Broadcasting was Francis C. Eighmey. KGLO began operation with only 250 watts of power. It was the <b>lowest</b> <b>wattage</b> radio station {{to be included in the}} CBS Radio Network, but the station served what was recognized as a key market area in the midwest.|$|R

40|$|AbstractE-liquids {{generally}} contain {{four main}} components: nicotine, flavours, water and carrier liquids. The carrier liquid dissolves flavours and nicotine and vaporises {{at a certain}} temperature on the atomizer of the e-cigarette. Propylene glycol and glycerol, the principal carriers used in e-liquids, undergo decomposition {{in contact with the}} atomizer heating-coil forming volatile carbonyls. Some of these, such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acrolein, are of concern due to their adverse impact on human health when inhaled at sufficient concentrations. The aim {{of this study was to}} correlate the yield of volatile carbonyls emitted by e-cigarettes with the temperature of the heating coil. For this purpose, a popular commercial e-liquid was machine-vaped on a third generation e-cigarette which allowed the variation of the output wattage (5 – 25 W) and therefore the heat generated on the atomizer heating-coil. The temperature of the heating-coil was determined by infrared thermography and the vapour generated at each temperature underwent subjective sensorial quality evaluation by an experienced vaper. A steep increase in the generated carbonyls was observed when applying a battery-output of at least 15 W corresponding to 200 – 250 °C on the heating coil. However, when considering concentrations in each inhaled puff, the short-term indoor air guideline value for formaldehyde was already exceeded at the <b>lowest</b> <b>wattage</b> of 5 W, which is the wattage applied in most 2 nd generation e-cigarettes. Concentrations of acetaldehyde in each puff were several times below the short-term irritation threshold value for humans. Acrolein was only detected from 20 W upwards. The negative sensorial quality evaluation by the volunteering vaper of the vapour generated at 20 W demonstrated the unlikelihood that such a wattage would be realistically set by a vaper. This study highlights the importance to develop standardised testing methods for the assessment of carbonyl-emissions and emissions of other potentially harmful compounds from e-cigarettes. The wide variety and variability of products available on the market make the development of such methods and the associated standardised testing conditions particularly demanding...|$|R

50|$|KPAC (91.9 FM) was an unlicensed, <b>low</b> <b>wattage</b> college {{radio station}} {{broadcasting}} on the University of the Pacific campus. The station was entirely student-run and was primarily listened to from its internet stream or the on-campus television network. The weekday programming followed a blocked schedule and included talk shows, hip-hop, house, rock, and some jazz/classical music, and house/dance was {{played on the}} weekend hours. KPAC had around 25+ student shows during both academic semesters. It has since been rebranded Tiger Radio.|$|E

5000|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{originally was}} lit by paraffin oil, {{but this was}} soon replaced by electricity, and the lighthouse was fitted with an 1,000-watt Incandescent light bulb. The luminous intensity was 180,000 Hefner candles. The rotating third-order lens spread the beams {{of light in the}} correct pattern [...] "every fifth second a flash alternating between red and white".Today, the lens no longer rotates, and the lamp is only 60 watts. Despite this <b>low</b> <b>wattage,</b> it still reaches about 15 kilometers out over the sea, providing guidance mainly for tourists and fishing boats.|$|E
50|$|To {{conserve}} {{energy consumption}} energy efficient and <b>low</b> <b>wattage</b> lights were used. Feature lighting was also minimised to reduce both power requirements {{and the impact}} of the bridge on the surrounding area. Cut-off timers and remote operation features were also incorporated {{to reduce the amount of}} unnecessary lighting while still maintaining a safe environment for users. The energy requirement of the bridge is generated by a high profile solar roof, containing 108 x 175W panels. The solar roof feeds electricity back into the supply authority grid thereby offsetting the mains power electricity used by the bridge at night.|$|E
5000|$|When the new Hall Searchlight signals were {{introduced}} in 1920, the recorded response by many engineman was classic: [...] "They took the old 'Hall Banjo Signal,' resurrected it from the grave and lighted it up!" [...] In the UK, original electromechanical searchlight signals consisted of a <b>low</b> <b>wattage</b> incandescent bulb mounted behind a semaphore spectacle devoid of a blade behind a target. The Union Switch and Signal Company searchlight signal ubiquitous to the United States has an internal cable with weights system to mechanically align the signal in the red position {{if there is a}} system failure.|$|E
50|$|After {{ten years}} {{many of the}} futuristic {{elements}} had been superseded by current technology, for example recycling of refuse was now common and <b>low</b> <b>wattage</b> lightbulbs were widely used in households. Other systems, for example the solar panels and {{ground source heat pumps}} remained prohibitively expensive. The contents had begun to look dated and it was claimed the museum's culture did not support serious investment to keep the technology ahead of fashion. With its days numbered as a futuristic exhibit, plans were put in place in 2009 to convert the house into an educational centre, named Ty Gwyrdd ('Green House'), to host environmental courses.|$|E

Mid- to large-size [...] "combo" [...] amps with 30 to 50 watts and one 12" [...] speaker or four 10" [...] speakers are designed for use in band rehearsals and onstage performances. Some guitar amps are designed for specific instruments or particular genres, such as the Marshall amps, which are widely used in heavy metal music.|$|E
50|$|A 3-way socket {{has three}} {{electrical}} contacts. In {{addition to the}} two contacts of the standard socket, a third contact is added. This contact is positioned off-center {{in the bottom of}} the socket (contact two in photo). This extra contact matches a ring-shaped contact on the bottom of a 3-way bulb, which creates the connection for the second filament inside the bulb. A problem of these devices is that the ring contact of the socket (contact two in photo) digs into the lead seal on the lamp bulb's contact ring and this connection tends to fail early (sometimes in months), leading to intermittent flashes, popping noises, and loss of power to the <b>low</b> <b>wattage</b> filament as the lead seal on the bulb's ring alternately melts and solidifies.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} channel 33 digital transmitter operated at {{a relatively}} <b>low</b> <b>wattage</b> (110 kW), and originated from the same tower as WPXD's analog signal in Lyndon Township; this resulted in interference with low-power Class A station W33BY, which also broadcast on UHF channel 33. On or about May 11, 2009, a new application to modify a digital allotment was filed by the FCC, to allow WPXD to broadcast its digital signal on channel 50 from the Southfield tower at a radiated power of 345 kW, which {{was approved by the}} FCC and the CRTC. On October 21, 2009, the FCC granted a construction permit for WPXD's new digital facilities in Southfield; the station estimated that the stronger signal would reach an additional 1.8 million viewers.|$|E
5000|$|In April 2012, Keats {{launched}} the Electrochemical Currency Exchange Co. {{in the basement}} of Rockefeller Center. According to The Economist, his enterprise exploited [...] "electrochemical arbitrage", generating energy by taking advantage of differences in the metallic content of Chinese and American coinages. The energy generated was used to power a data processing center, but, due to the <b>low</b> <b>wattage,</b> the center consisted of pocket calculators, limiting computations to addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. On May 16, 2012, a similar experiment was held in Hong Kong in the lobby of an HSBC building. But this time the electrochemical charge was derived exclusively from Chinese currency: aluminum Chinese fen and brass Hong Kong pennies. A special website was made for this particular event: https://web.archive.org/web/20130613165410/http://michingmalicho.com/.|$|E
5000|$|In {{spite of}} WHOD's <b>low</b> <b>wattage</b> (1,000 watts {{compared}} to 50,000 watts on KDKA.), Chedwick became Pittsburgh's [...] "Pied Piper of Platter". By the early 1950s, black music record labels were {{hearing about the}} noise Chedwick was making in Pittsburgh with old R&B stock, so they began inundating him with new material. He introduced the new material to his [...] "movers and groovers," [...] never accepting payola though payola was the norm at the time. Still, oldies would dominate his playlist. Shortly after being honored by WAMO for his years of service in 1984, he was let go by the station. He would work at various other stations in the Pittsburgh market until executives from Sheridan Broadcasting (WAMO's parent company) {{asked him to come}} back in 1992.|$|E
5000|$|In 2000, Hirasawa {{switched}} from a gasoline-powered {{car to a}} hybrid electric, developing an interest in sustainable energy, specifically {{in the idea of}} using solar power to make music. [...] He purchased two 120-watt solar panels, outfitted his home studio to be powered by them, and connected two car batteries to store additional energy, which combined allowed Hirasawa to work for 12 hours. To further optimize the work hours and prepare for bad weather days, only equipment necessary for work was ever kept on. The studio was illuminated by less than 30 small <b>low</b> <b>wattage</b> blue LEDs. Hirasawa's workdays ended when there was no more energy remaining. In total, less than 7 kg of carbon dioxide were emitted during the making of the album.|$|E
50|$|During the 1960s Ampeg only {{produced}} fairly <b>low</b> <b>wattage</b> combo amplifiers. Rock concerts {{were becoming}} increasingly large affairs and bigger amplifiers were needed. In 1969, Ampeg's Chief Engineer Bill Hughes designed the Super Valve Technology circuitry for the amplifier {{of the same}} name. At 85 lb, the Ampeg SVT provided 300 watts of RMS power, considerably more than most other bass amplifiers of the era. The high power rating made the SVT a candidate for use in larger venues. The SVT saw widespread use by rock acts in the 1970s and is still {{considered by many to}} be the world standard reference bass amp. The SVT-VR (Vintage Reissue) is almost identical in design and construction and the closest thing to any of the original SVT models produced by Ampeg.|$|E
50|$|The station had a {{construction}} permit for airing an analog signal on UHF channel 29. However, {{this was not}} activated before the analog shutdown on June 12, 2009. Originally, WNBW indicated it would eventually air some local programming including local newscasts {{by the start of}} 2010. This is required to maintain its NBC affiliation. Due to the <b>low</b> <b>wattage</b> of its transmitter, any usable signal is not received for the majority of Gainesville residents. Ironically, WYME broadcasts a higher-powered analog signal even though it is a Class A station. That station, which had been serving as a repeater of WMYG, became a separate outlet and joined MeTV. The service is a network specifically designed for digital subchannels offering classic television sitcoms, dramas, and classic commercials from the 1950s through 1980s. WNBW launched a second digital subchannel to offer WYME a digital signal.|$|E
50|$|Usually a thin {{nichrome}} wire is used. Some applications {{also use}} platinum-silver alloy; other bridgewire materials in use are platinum, gold, silver, tungsten, etc. Care {{has to be}} taken when selecting the material as it is in direct contact with the pyrotechnic composition and should not undergo corrosion in such conditions. Another material, able to actively release chemical energy, is Pyrofuze, aluminium wire clad with palladium; when being heated it undergoes strongly exothermic reaction as the molten metals form an alloy. A variant with the same function consists of laminated thin alternate layers of aluminium and nickel. Carbon bridge is a thin spot of colloidal graphite used as the bridgewire. Some variants use a conductive pyrotechnic composition as the resistive material. In amateur rocketry, grossly overloaded <b>low</b> <b>wattage</b> metal film resistors and 0805 Surface-mount technology resistors are also used.|$|E
