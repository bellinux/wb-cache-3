6000|$|When all was over, Charles rushed off to Cannes, to {{get away}} from the impertinent stare of London. Amelia and Isabel and I went with him. We were driving one {{afternoon}} on the hills beyond the town, among the myrtle and <b>lentisk</b> scrub, when we noticed in front of us a nice victoria, containing two ladies in very deep mourning. We followed it, unintentionally, as far as Le Grand Pin--that big pine tree that looks across the bay towards Antibes. There, the ladies descended and sat down on a knoll, gazing out disconsolately towards the sea and the islands. It was evident they were suffering very deep grief. Their faces were pale and their eyes bloodshot. [...] "Poor things!" [...] Amelia said. Then her tone altered suddenly.|$|E

She had one fair son, named Theseus, the bravest lad in all the land; and Aithra never smiled but when she looked at him, for her husband had forgotten her, and lived far away. And she used {{to go up to the}} mountain above Troezene, to the temple of Poseidon and sit there all day looking out across the bay, over Methana, to the purple peaks of Ægina and the Attic shore beyond. And when Theseus was full fifteen years old she took him up with her to the temple, and into the thickets of the grove which grew in the temple-yard. And she led him to a tall plane-tree, beneath whose shade grew arbutus, and <b>lentisk,</b> and purple heather-bushes. And there she sighed, and said, ‘Theseus, my son, go into that thicket and you will find at the plane-tree foot a great flat stone; lift it, and bring me what lies underneath.’ ...|$|E

40|$|Pistacia {{lentiscus}} berry oil (LBO) {{represents a}} typical vegetal {{product of the}} Mediterranean basin that has been formally used in traditional cuisine for 100 s of years. In addition to its interesting alimentary properties, this product could represent an interesting candidate {{in the field of}} research on the study of new anti-infective agents. In fact, in Mediterranean countries, <b>lentisk</b> oil still continues to be widely used in folk medicine for oral and skin affections, in particular, acute gingivitis, pediatric skin infections such as impetigo and foot plaques, and biofilm related infections often associated with Streptococcus spp. Following these observations, we have hypothesized a “lentisk oil-bacteria” interaction, placing particular emphasis on the different Streptococcal species involved in these oral and skin diseases. In accordance with this hypothesis, the use of standard antimicrobial-antibiofilm methods (MIC, MBC, MBIC) allowed the interesting behavior of these bacteria to be observed and, in this context, the response to <b>lentisk</b> oil appears to be correlated with the pathogenic profile of the considered microorganism. Two probiotic strains of S. salivarius K 12 /M 18 appeared to be non-sensitive to this product, while a set of five different pathogenic strains (S. agalactiae, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. pyogenes) showed a response that was correlated to the fatty acid metabolic pathway of the considered species. In fact, at different times of bacteria development, selective High Performance Liquid Chromatography analysis of the growth medium containing LBO detected a significant increase in free unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) in particular oleic, palmitic and linoleic acids, which are already known for their antibacterial activity. In this context, we have hypothesized that LBO could be able to modulate the pathogen/probiotic rate in a Streptococcal population using the fatty acid metabolic pathway to help the probiotic strain. This hypothesis was strengthened by performing antibacterial testing with oleic acid and an in silico evaluation of the Streptococcal MCRA protein, an enzyme involved in the production of saturated fatty acids from UFA. These results show that LBO may have been used in ancient times as a “natural microbial modulating extract” in the prevention of biofilm- associated diseases...|$|E
40|$|The {{crucial point}} for the {{exploitation}} of Mediterranean species for agronomic purposes relies {{on the availability of}} planting material with high physiological quality. As it is known, the plant propagation may be realized by seed or by asexual or vegetative propagation. The latter has an unquestionable advantage for the propagator because it allows obtaining plants that reproduce exactly the genetic and morphological characteristics of the parent plant and, theoretically, it allows to obtain a large number of individuals in a short time. Among the various types of asexual propagation used in the nursery industry, cutting propagation finds the greater application as it is technically easier to run and economically profitable in respect to all possible alternative methods. It would be advantageous to set up such propagation method for Mediterranean shrubs that are difficult-to-root, on the one hand selecting superior genotypes {{and on the other hand}} developing technical strategies for the improvement of donor physiology and the rooting competence. The environmental factors, irradiance above all, but also nutrient and water availability in the substrate for growth, influence the physiological, hormonal and nutritional status of stock plants and may influence the cuttings quality and their rooting ability. The ontogenetic age of cutting may also influence the propagating attitude of the species. As regards myrtle and <b>lentisk,</b> few studies have been done concerning the influence of stock plant physiology on rooting. Crobeddu and Pignatti (2005) studied the rooting results of rejuvenated plants, many other Authors focused on micropropagation but no considerations were done about the physiology of donors. The primary objective of the present research was to enhance the use as ornamental plants of two typical species of the Mediterranean environment, by means of the optimization of nurseries cycles. In particular, the study focused on physiological and morphological features potentially related to adventitious rooting in myrtle and <b>lentisk.</b> The specific objectives aimed at: - Determining the influence of light availability and rejuvenation on the morphological, chemical and ecophysiological features of mature plants - Assessing the eventual influences on rooting - Assessing the influence of intra-specific variability on propagation trials, with the declared aim to look for genotypes offering an economically supportable option to propagate the studied species...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objective: Pistacia {{lentiscus}} L. (Anacardiaceae {{mastic tree}} or <b>lentisk)</b> is a bush playing {{an important role}} in the Mediterranean maquis ecosystem. For this purpose, a study on different accessions of mastic tree was carried out in Southern Italy to define the variability of characters related to morphology and survival under salt stress conditions. Methodology: This was study evaluated under nursery conditions the growing responses of 10 accessions of P. lentiscusto 6 different levels of salinization obtained by adding 0, 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 g of salts 100 L- 1 of substrate, respectively. The following parameters were recorded; plant height, survival of plants and total root length, total biomass, number of leaves per plant and leaf area. Results: The results showed that P. lentiscuscan well tolerate salt at high concentrations when grown under nursery conditions. Furthermore, among the investigated germplasm, a different plant accessions response to salt stress was observed. Conclusion: Thus, by identifying of mastic tree accessions more tolerant to salty soil and the revegetation of degraded agricultural lands can be attained...|$|E
40|$|Glazed {{ceramics}} {{have not}} typically been sampled for organic residue analysis because the glaze is not porous; therefore, {{it is commonly}} believed that these ceramics cannot absorb substances. Although this is partially true, {{the aim of this}} paper is to demonstrate that the glaze may exhibit imperfections due to the production process or the use of ceramics and that these imperfections allow the ceramic matrix to trap residues of the food contained in the vessels. The absorption of organic residues in glazed ceramics is demonstrated by analyses of modern vessels experimentally enriched with wine and vegetable oils (olive and <b>lentisk</b> oils) and archaeological vessels obtained from post-medieval Florence (Italy) and medieval Pla d’Almatà (Balaguer, Lleida, Spain). The analyses were conducted using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry following different extraction protocols aimed at identifying lipids and wine residues preserved in the ceramic vessels. Images of the glazed ceramic coating were recorded using an optical microscope and a scanning electron microscope to verify the presence of imperfections. In addition to providing information about the use of the studied vessels, the obtained results demonstrate how glazed ceramics can be studied to recover information regarding ceramic use and dietary practices in medieval and post-medieval periods when glazed wares were very common...|$|E
40|$|Forestry {{plantations}} with evergreen broadleaf {{species in}} Mediterranean climate sites usually perform poorly in the field. Holm oak (Quercus ilex ssp. ballota (Desf.) Samp.), cork oak (Quercus suber L.), {{wild olive tree}} (Olea europaea L. ssp. europaea var. sylvestris) and <b>lentisk</b> tree (Pistacia lentiscus L.) are extensively used for such plantations. In {{order to determine the}} environmental factor that induces cold hardening most effectively and the mechanisms that are involved in this process, seven month-old nursery seedlings were taken to three growth chambers during the hardening phase and submitted to: 22 / 17 ºC (day/night) and decreasing photoperiod from 12 to 8 h (Ph chamber), 12 h photoperiod and decreasing temperature from 22 / 17 ºC to 8 / 3 ºC (T chamber); and progressive reductions in temperature and photoperiod (PhT chamber). The variation of morpho-physiological traits was assessed. Reducing the photoperiod by up to 8 h did not stop the growth in height and diameter. Air temperatures below 8 ºC reduced substantially height growth, mainly in Quercus species, but not diameter growth. Reducing the temperature proved much more effective for cold hardening than reducing the photoperiod. Low temperatures induced seedlings to accumulate non-structural carbohydrates (soluble sugars in the leaves and roots, and starch in the roots), and to improve cold hardiness. Differences among species were observed in cold hardiness, with Q. ilex > Q. suber ≥ P. lentiscus ≥ O. europaea. The maximum level of cold hardiness achieved in this experiment by Q. suber and Q. ilex was reached when seedlings accumulated 775 - 800 h 8 (hours ≤ 8 °C), 750 h 8 in O. europaea and 725 h 8 in P. lentiscus. Finally, measuring chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) after a freezing test was useful in estimating the cold hardiness of these species, providing results in less than two days for plant quality purposes...|$|E
