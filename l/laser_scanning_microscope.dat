50|$|Two-photon {{excitation}} microscopy: Although {{they use}} a related technology (both are <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>microscopes),</b> multiphoton fluorescence microscopes are not strictly confocal microscopes.

50|$|The {{bleached}} profile {{will not}} be a radial step function. If the bleached spot is effectively a single pixel then the bleaching as a function of position will typically be diffraction limited and determined by the optics of the confocal <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>microscope</b> used. This is not a radial step function and also varies along the axis perpendicular to the plane.|$|E
50|$|The rise of {{fluorescence}} microscopy drove {{the development of}} a major modern microscope design, the confocal microscope. The principle was patented in 1957 by Marvin Minsky, although laser technology limited practical application of the technique. It was not until 1978 when Thomas and Christoph Cremer developed the first practical confocal <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>microscope</b> and the technique rapidly gained popularity through the 1980s.|$|E

50|$|Spinning-disk (Nipkow disk) {{confocal}} microscopes use {{a series}} of moving pinholes on a disc to scan spots of light. Since {{a series of}} pinholes scans an area in parallel each pinhole is allowed to hover over a specific area for a longer amount of time thereby reducing the excitation energy needed to illuminate a sample when compared to <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>microscopes.</b> Decreased excitation energy reduces photo-toxicity and photo-bleaching of a sample often making it the preferred system for imaging live cells or organisms.|$|R
50|$|Sim Scanner is {{a feature}} of the Olympus FluoView FV1000 {{confocal}} <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>microscope.</b> The system incorporates two laser scanners, one for confocal imaging and the other for simultaneous stimulation. They can be illuminated separately and independently, making it possible to stimulate the specimen during observation. As a result, the rapid cell reactions that occur right after laser stimulation can be captured, making the Sim Scanner suitable for such applications as Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), Fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP), photoactivation and photoconversion.|$|E
50|$|Ceramic microstructures {{are most}} often {{analyzed}} by reflected visible-light microscopy in brightfield. Darkfield is used in limited circumstances, e.g., to reveal cracks. Polarized transmitted light is used with thin sections, where the contrast between grains comes from birefringence. Very fine microstructures may require the higher magnification and resolution of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) or confocal <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>microscope</b> (CLSM). The cathodoluminescence microscope (CLM) is useful for distinguishing phases of refractories. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) and scanning acoustic microscope (SAM) have specialty applications in ceramography.|$|E
50|$|The LVP {{instrument}} measures {{voltage waveform}} signals in the device diffusion regions. Device imaging is accomplished {{through the use}} of a <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>microscope</b> (LSM). The LVP uses dual infra-red (IR) lasers to perform both device imaging and waveform acquisition. One laser is used to acquire images or waveforms from the device, while the second laser provides a reference which may be used to subtract unwanted noise from the signal data being acquired. On an electrically active device, the instrument monitors the changes in the phase of the electromagnetic field surrounding a signal being applied to a junction.|$|E
50|$|Each {{of these}} classes of {{confocal}} microscope have particular advantages and disadvantages. Most systems are either optimized for recording speed (i.e. video capture) or high spatial resolution. Confocal <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>microscopes</b> {{can have a}} programmable sampling density and very high resolutions while Nipkow and PAM use a fixed sampling density defined by the camera's resolution. Imaging frame rates are typically slower for single point <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> systems than spinning-disk or PAM systems. Commercial spinning-disk confocal microscopes achieve frame rates of over 50 per second - a desirable feature for dynamic observations such as live cell imaging.|$|R

40|$|Techniques {{based on}} <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>microscopes</b> for nanoprocessing of {{periodic}} structures on silicon with ultra-short laser pulses have been developed. Ripples of 800 - 900 nm spacing were obtained after laser irradiation at a wavelength of 1040 nm, a repetition rate of 10 kHz and a fluence of 2 J/cm 2 in air.

50|$|Developments at the University of Stockholm {{around the}} same time led to a {{commercial}} CLSM distributed by the Swedish company Sarastro. The venture was acquired in 1990 by Molecular Dynamics, but the CLSM was eventually discontinued. In Germany, Heidelberg Instruments, founded in 1984, developed a CLSM which was initially meant for industrial applications, rather than Biology. This instrument was taken over in 1990 by Leica Lasertechnik. Zeiss already had a non-confocal flying-spot <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>microscope</b> on the market which was upgraded to a confocal. A report from 1990, mentioning “some” manufacturers of confocals lists: Sarastro, Technical Instrument, Meridian Instruments, Bio-Rad, Leica, Tracor-Northern and Zeiss.|$|E
50|$|Fluorescence Loss in Photobleaching (FLIP) is a {{fluorescence}} microscopy technique {{used to examine}} movement of molecules inside cells and membranes. A cell membrane is typically labeled with a fluorescent dye to allow for observation. A specific area of this labeled section is then bleached several times using the beam of a confocal <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>microscope.</b> After each imagining scan, bleaching occurs again. This occurs several times, {{to ensure that all}} accessible fluorophores are bleached since unbleached fluorophores are exchanged for bleached fluorophores, causing movement through the cell membrane. The amount of fluorescence from that region is then measured {{over a period of time}} to determine the results of the photobleaching on the cell as a whole.|$|E
50|$|On {{the basis}} of {{experience}} gained in the construction and application of the UV laser micro irradiation instrument, the Cremer brothers designed in 1978 a laser scanning process which scans point-by-point the three-dimensional surface of an object {{by means of a}} focused laser beam and creates the over-all picture by electronic means similar to those used in scanning electron microscopes. It is this plan {{for the construction of a}} confocal <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>microscope</b> (CSLM), which for the first time combined the laser scanning method with the 3D detection of biological objects labeled with fluorescent markers that earned Cremer his professorial position at the University of Heidelberg. During the next decade, the confocal fluorescence microscopy was developed into a technically fully matured state in particular by groups working at the University of Amsterdam and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg and their industry partners. In later years, this technology was adopted widely by biomolecular and biomedical laboratories and remains to this day the gold standard as far as three-dimensional light microscopy with conventional resolution is concerned.|$|E
50|$|A 4Pi <b>microscope</b> is a <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> {{fluorescence}} <b>microscope</b> with {{an improved}} axial resolution. The typical value of 500-700 nm {{can be improved}} to 100-150 nm, which corresponds to an almost spherical focal spot with 5-7 times less volume than that of standard confocal microscopy.|$|R
40|$|Confocal or {{multi-photon}} <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>microscopes</b> are convenient {{tools to}} perform FRAP diffusion measurements. Despite its popularity, accurate FRAP remains often challenging since current methods are either limited to relatively large bleach regions {{or can be}} complicated for non-specialists. In order to bring reliable quantitative FRAP measurements to the broad community of <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> microscopy users, here we have revised FRAP theory and present a new pixel based FRAP method relying on the photo bleaching of rectangular regions of any size and aspect ratio. The method allows for fast and straightforward quantitative diffusion measurements due to a closed–form expression for the recovery process utilizing all available spatial and temporal data. After a detailed validation, its versatility is demonstrated by diffusion studies in heterogeneous biopolymer mixtures...|$|R

50|$|Second-harmonic imaging {{microscopy}} (SHIM) {{is based}} on a nonlinear optical effect known as second-harmonic generation (SHG). SHIM has been established as a viable microscope imaging contrast mechanism for visualization of cell and tissue structure and function. A second-harmonic microscope obtains contrasts from variations in a specimen’s ability to generate second-harmonic light from the incident light while a conventional optical microscope obtains its contrast by detecting variations in optical density, path length, or refractive index of the specimen. SHG requires intense laser light passing through a material with a noncentrosymmetric molecular structure. Second-harmonic light emerging from an SHG material is exactly half the wavelength (frequency doubled) of the light entering the material. While two-photon-excited fluorescence (TPEF) is also a two photon process, TPEF loses some energy during the relaxation of the excited state, while SHG is energy conserving. Typically, an inorganic crystal is used to produce SHG light such as lithium niobate (LiNbO3), potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP = KTiOPO4), and lithium triborate (LBO = LiB3O5). Though SHG requires a material to have specific molecular orientation in order for the incident light to be frequency doubled, some biological materials can be highly polarizable, and assemble into fairly ordered, large noncentrosymmetric structures. Biological materials such as collagen, microtubules, and muscle myosin can produce SHG signals. The SHG pattern is mainly determined by the phase matching condition. A common setup for an SHG imaging system will have a <b>laser</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>microscope</b> with a titanium sapphire mode-locked laser as the excitation source. The SHG signal is propagated in the forward direction. However, some experiments have shown that objects on the order of about a tenth of the wavelength of the SHG produced signal will produce nearly equal forward and backward signals.|$|E
