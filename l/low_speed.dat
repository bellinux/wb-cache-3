5|$|To {{eliminate}} this danger, if a USB hub detects {{a mix of}} {{high speed}} or full speed and <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> devices, it will by default disable communication to <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> device unless requested to switch to <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> mode. On reception of a PRE packet however, it will temporarily re-enable the output port to all <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> devices, to allow the host to send a single <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> packet to <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> devices. After the <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> packet is sent, an end of packet (EOP) signal will tell the hub to disable all outputs to <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> devices again.|$|E
5|$|Wet snow {{avalanches}} are a low-velocity {{suspension of}} snow and water, with the flow confined {{to the surface of}} the pathway. The <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> of travel is due to the friction between the sliding surface of the pathway and the water saturated flow. Despite the <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> of travel (~), wet snow avalanches are capable of generating powerful destructive forces, due to the large mass, and density.|$|E
5|$|High-speed USB2.0 hubs contain devices called {{transaction}} translators that convert between high-speed USB2.0 {{buses and}} full and <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> buses. When a high-speed USB2.0 hub is plugged into a high-speed USB host or hub, it operates in high-speed mode. The USB hub then uses either one transaction translator per hub {{to create a}} full/low-speed bus routed to all full and <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> devices on the hub, or uses one transaction translator per port to create an isolated full/low-speed bus per port on the hub.|$|E

50|$|Marx, Redding and Simmons and McInnes {{calculated}} that the energy conversion efficiency of terrestrial laser-driven propulsion is approximately proportional to v/c at <b>low</b> <b>speeds</b> (v<0.1c), thus is small at <b>low</b> <b>speeds</b> (v<<0.1c). However, at higher speeds (v>0.1c), owing to the favorable Doppler-shift energy transfer, on-board photon propulsion becomes much more energy efficient.|$|R

5|$|A Sm3 derailed near Karjaa on 25 July 2003 due to {{a defect}} in a turnout. The train derailed at a <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> after {{mechanics}} turned the turnout blades manually into the correct position, but forgot to check the turnout frog, which was set to a diverging track.

40|$|The {{velocity}} {{control of}} DC motors at <b>low</b> <b>speeds</b> {{is very important}} in the field of assembly and precision measuring mechatronic systems. The oscillations caused by the friction between the commutator brushes and the rotor are especially predominant at very <b>low</b> <b>speeds.</b> They produce an unstable robot work at the position zone. In this paper we present a Fuzzy cancellation of damaging oscillations at <b>low</b> <b>speeds.</b> We use the system differential equation and a rule base to estimate the static and dynamic effects of friction. Finally, we discuss the implications of this scheme and raise some issues for a future research. 1...|$|R

5|$|A hub is able {{to support}} low {{bandwidth}} devices mixed with other speed device via a special PID value, PRE. This is required as a USB hub functions as a very simple repeater, broadcasting the host message to all connected devices regardless if the packet was for it or not. This means in a mixed speed environment, {{there is a potential}} danger that a <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> will misinterpret a high or full speed signal from the host.|$|E
5|$|Although {{she had not}} {{suffered}} {{anything like}} the damage she had inflicted, Virginia was not completely unscathed. Shots from Cumberland, Congress, and Union troops ashore had riddled her smokestack, reducing her already <b>low</b> <b>speed.</b> Two of her guns were disabled and several armor plates had been loosened. Two of her crew were killed, and more were wounded. One of the wounded was Captain Buchanan, whose left thigh was pierced by a rifle shot.|$|E
5|$|One {{study has}} shown {{theoretically}} that, while a bike leaned in a turn, road undulations can excite the weave mode {{at high speed}} or the wobble mode at <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> if either of their frequencies match the vehicle speed and other parameters. Excitation of the wobble mode can be mitigated by an effective steering damper and excitation of the weave mode is worse for light riders than for heavy riders.|$|E

5|$|Because of delays from Stadler's subcontractors, five {{instead of}} eight trams were {{available}} when the line opened on 22 June 2010.

On 7 June, two trams collided at <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> at Byparken, causing a derailment and forced the two trams to be repaired. This caused the summer schedule to {{be reduced to a}} 30-minute headway. From 1 November, the line started running every six minutes during the rush hour.

5|$|Despite {{frequent}} derailments, <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> meant Wotton Tramway {{had a good}} safety record. The locomotives occasionally {{ran over}} stray sheep, and on 12September1888 sparks {{from one of the}} Aveling and Porter engines blew back into one of the train's cattle trucks, igniting the straw bedding and badly burning two cows. The line had one serious accident, in which Ellen Maria Nickalls, a servant at Wotton House, was struck by a locomotive near Church Siding and killed. The coroner returned a verdict of accidental death, absolving driver James Challis.|$|E
5|$|Musashi {{was built}} with a Type 0 {{hydrophone}} system in her bow.

Two Type 22 surface-search radars were installed on the forward superstructure in July 1943. During repairs in April 1944, the Type 21 radar was replaced by a more modern version and a Type 13 early-warning radar was fitted.|$|E
5|$|One major anomaly {{remained}} in the railway's operations: the 1889 Regulation of Railways Act had required, amongst other measures, that all British passenger trains be fitted with continuous brakes. McConnel had secured an exemption for the Talyllyn Railway, {{on the basis that}} the <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> of operation meant they were unnecessary and that the cost of compliance would bankrupt the enterprise, {{but by the end of}} the 1990s the Railway Inspectorate was insisting that the Talyllyn be brought into compliance with the act, a little over 100years after it had passed. By 2001, the railway had fitted its entire passenger fleet with the necessary equipment, operated by air brake pumps mounted on the locomotives.|$|E

5|$|Steering was {{controlled}} {{with a single}} rudder. The ships were described as good sea-boats, but were prone to heavy pitching. The ships were responsive and had a tight turning radius at <b>low</b> <b>speed,</b> but at hard rudder of 12degrees, the ships lost up to 70percent speed. The ships had a crew of 35officers and 708men normally, and when serving as a squadron flagship, they had an additional 13officers and 66men. The ships carried a number of smaller boats aboard, including two picket boats, two launches, a pinnace (later removed), two cutters, two yawls, and two dinghies.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Britain proved for {{the first}} time that the Junkers Ju 87 was {{vulnerable}} in hostile skies against well-organised and determined fighter opposition. The Ju 87, like other dive bombers, was slow and possessed inadequate defences. Furthermore, it could not be effectively protected by fighters because of its <b>low</b> <b>speed,</b> and the very low altitudes at which it ended its dive bomb attacks. The Stuka depended on air superiority, the very thing being contested over Britain. It was withdrawn from attacks on Britain in August after prohibitive losses, leaving the Luftwaffe without precision ground-attack aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The ships' hulls were {{constructed}} from longitudinal steel frames. The hulls {{were divided into}} fourteen watertight compartments and a double bottom that extended for 72percent {{of the length of}} the keel. The Kriegsmarine regarded the ships as good sea boats, with gentle motion. At <b>low</b> <b>speed,</b> however, they were affected unpredictably by wind and currents. The ships heeled up to fourteen degrees and lost up to 50% speed with the rudder hard over at high speed. The ships had a standard complement of 42officers and 1,340enlisted men. Wartime modifications increased the crew to 51officers and 1,548sailors. The ships carried several smaller vessels, including two picket boats, two barges, one launch, one pinnace, and two dinghies.|$|E
