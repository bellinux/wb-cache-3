5|$|Three {{channels}} facilitate lymphatic drainage {{from the}} cervix. The anterior and lateral cervix drains to nodes along the uterine arteries, travelling along the cardinal ligaments {{at the base}} of the broad ligament to the external iliac <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and ultimately the paraaortic <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> The posterior and lateral cervix drains along the uterine arteries to the internal iliac <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and ultimately the paraaortic <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> and the posterior section of the cervix drains to the obturator and presacral <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> However, there are variations as lymphatic drainage from the cervix travels to different sets of pelvic nodes in some people. This has implications in scanning nodes for involvement in cervical cancer.|$|E
5|$|Lymphatic {{drainage}} frequently {{passes the}} prelaryngeal <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> (located {{just above the}} isthmus), and the pretracheal and paratracheal <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> The gland receives sympathetic nerve supply from the superior, middle and inferior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic trunk.

5|$|The {{most common}} site of {{recurrence}} {{is in the}} vagina; vaginal relapses of endometrial cancer have the best prognosis. If relapse occurs from a cancer {{that has not been}} treated with radiation, EBRT is the first-line treatment and is often successful. If a cancer treated with radiation recurs, pelvic exenteration is the only option for curative treatment. Palliative chemotherapy, cytoreductive surgery, and radiation are also performed. Radiation therapy (VBT and EBRT) for a local vaginal recurrence has a 50% five-year survival rate. Pelvic recurrences are treated with surgery and radiation, and abdominal recurrences are treated with radiation and, if possible, chemotherapy. Other common recurrence sites are the pelvic <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> para-aortic <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> peritoneum (28% of recurrences), and lungs, though recurrences can also occur in the brain (<1%), liver (7%), adrenal glands (1%), bones (4–7%; typically the axial skeleton), <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> outside the abdomen (0.4–1%), spleen, and muscle/soft tissue (2–6%).|$|E
50|$|The {{practice}} of sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> mapping {{has changed the}} surgical approach in many cancer systems, sparing a formal <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection for patients with sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> negative for tumor and directing a full node dissection for patients with sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> positive for tumor metastases. For example in stage II breast carcinoma, using the sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> technique, 65% of patients could be spared from a formal node dissection.|$|R
30|$|<b>Lymph</b> <b>node</b> {{status is}} not part of the FIGO {{classification}} system; however, <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastases are an important independent adverse prognostic factor [10]. The depth of stromal tumour invasion is associated with an increased risk for <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastases [11]. Surgical <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection remains the “gold standard” for the diagnosis of <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastases, but it may be associated with postoperative complication rates of up to 17 % [12] and with unwanted side effects such as lymphoceles and wound infections. Therefore, preoperative assessment of <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> stage using imaging may have great clinical importance.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} histopathologic {{findings and}} <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> recurrence in right colon cancer {{to evaluate the}} indication for laparoscopy-assisted colectomy and para-aortic <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection. Forty-six patients who had undergone curative resection for right colon cancer in a recent one decade were studied. Tumors with invasion into the colonic wall no deeper than the proper muscle layer (n = 13) were not associated with <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis. Patients whose primary lesions were smaller than 20 mm in maximum diameter had no <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis.

5|$|Many {{blood vessels}} serve the {{esophagus}}, with blood supply varying along its course. The upper {{parts of the}} esophagus and the upper esophageal sphincter receive blood from the inferior thyroid artery, {{the parts of the}} esophagus in the thorax from the bronchial arteries and branches directly from the thoracic aorta, and the lower parts of the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter receive blood from the left gastric artery and the left inferior phrenic artery. The venous drainage also differs along the course of the esophagus. The upper and middle parts of the esophagus drain into the azygos and hemiazygos veins, and blood from the lower part drains into the left gastric vein. All these veins drain into the superior vena cava, {{with the exception of the}} left gastric vein, which is a branch of the portal vein. Lymphatically, the upper third of the esophagus drains into the deep cervical <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> the middle into the superior and posterior mediastinal <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> and the lower esophagus into the gastric and celiac <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> This is similar to the lymphatic drainage of the abdominal structures that arise from the foregut, which all drain into the celiac nodes.|$|E

30|$|Moreover, {{there is}} no clear {{evidence}} for dissection of para-aortic <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis from digestive cancer including PDC. In 2014, Tsubraya reported the effectiveness of para-aortic <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection for gastric cancer with extensive <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis including para-aortic <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis after neoadjuvant chemotherapy [6]. Also, Arimoto reported that the 3 -year overall survival was 41.2 %, though the recurrence rate after para-aortic <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection for patients with colorectal cancer receiving neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy was quite high [7]. So, we considered {{that there may be a}} value in trying para-aortic <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection in such our case.|$|R
50|$|Near the medulla is the hilum of <b>lymph</b> <b>node.</b> This is {{the place}} where blood vessels enter and leave the <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> and lymphatic vessels leave the <b>lymph</b> <b>node.</b> <b>Lymph</b> vessels {{entering}} the node do so along the perimeter (outer surface).|$|R
5|$|The {{incubation}} period between contraction {{and the first}} obvious symptoms of the disease is around 12 days. Once inhaled, variola major virus invades the oropharyngeal (mouth and throat) or the respiratory mucosa, migrates to regional <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> and begins to multiply. In the initial growth phase the virus seems to move from cell to cell, but around the 12th day, lysis of many infected cells occurs and the virus {{is found in the}} bloodstream in large numbers (this is called viremia), and a second wave of multiplication occurs in the spleen, bone marrow, and <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{surgical}} cases, {{the odds}} of cure {{vary depending on the}} tumor location and whether the tumor can be completely, or only partially, removed. Distal cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the common bile duct) are generally treated surgically with a Whipple procedure; long-term survival rates range from 15%–25%, although one series reported a five-year survival of 54% for patients with no involvement of the <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the bile ducts within the liver) are usually treated with partial hepatectomy. Various series have reported survival estimates after surgery ranging from 22%–66%; the outcome may depend on involvement of <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and completeness of the surgery. Perihilar cholangiocarcinomas (those occurring near where the bile ducts exit the liver) are least likely to be operable. When surgery is possible, they are generally treated with an aggressive approach often including removal of the gallbladder and potentially part of the liver. In patients with operable perihilar tumors, reported 5-year survival rates range from 20%–50%.|$|E
5|$|The {{spread of}} {{pancreatic}} cancer to other organs (metastasis) may also cause symptoms. Typically, pancreatic adenocarcinoma first spreads to nearby <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> {{and later to}} the liver or to the peritoneal cavity, large intestine or lungs. It is uncommon for it to spread to the bones or brain.|$|E

40|$|Either radical mastectomy with axillar lymphadenectomy or {{conservative}} surgery with axillar <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection are the standard treatments {{for patients with}} breast carcinoma. Sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> biopsy is a new method that - if negative - allows axillar <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> preservation and so minimizes major complications associated with this operation (especially lymphedema of the upper extremity). However, {{the development of the}} diagnostic means gave rise to new clinical entities - micrometastases and findings of clusters or solitary cells in the sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node.</b> Even though the probability of non-sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastasis is only 10 %, all patients with the finding of micrometastases in the sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> are currently indicated for axillar <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection.

40|$|Uninfected dogs (n = 10) {{and those}} {{naturally}} infected with leishmaniasis (n = 10) {{were subjected to}} several diagnostic tests, namely: hemoculture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of hemoculture, indirect immunofluorescence (RIFI), cytological examination of <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> aspirate, culture of <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> aspirate and PCR of <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> aspirate. RIFI - followed by PCR of <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> aspirate culture - presented more positive results in infected dogs than in uninfected ones. In infected animals, RIFI was more effective than PCR of <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> aspirate culture. There was no statistical difference in positivity between RIFI and hemoculture; <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> aspirate culture/cytological examination of <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> aspirate and PCR of hemoculture; and between PCR of <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> aspirate culture and PCR of hemoculture.

5|$|For both NSCLC and SCLC, the {{two general}} types of staging {{evaluations}} are clinical staging and surgical staging. Clinical staging is performed prior to definitive surgery.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{reports on the}} {{frequency}} of non-sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> involvement when isolated tumor cells {{are found in the}} sentinel node, but results and recommendations for the use of an axillary <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection differ among studies. This systematic review was conducted to give an overview of this issue and to provide recommendations for the use of an axillary <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection in these patients. We searched Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases from January 1, 2002, through November 27, 2007, for articles on patients with invasive breast cancer who had isolated tumor cells in the sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> (according to the sixth edition of the Cancer Staging Manual of the American Joint Committee on Cancer) and who also underwent axillary <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection. Of 411 selected articles, 29 (including 836 patients) were included in this review. These 29 studies were heterogeneous, reporting a wide range of non-sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> involvement (defined as the presence of isolated tumor cells or micro- or macrometastases) associated with isolated tumor cells in the sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node,</b> with an overall pooled risk for such involvement of 12. 3 % (95 % confidence interval = 9. 5 % to 15. 7 %). This pooled risk estimate was marginally higher than the risk of a false-negative sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> biopsy examination (ie, 7 %- 8 %) but marginally lower than the risk of non-sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> metastases in patients with micrometastases (ie, approximately 20 %) who are currently eligible for an axillary <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection. Because 36 (64 %) of the 56 patients with isolated tumor cells in their sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> also had non-sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> macrometastases, those patients with isolated tumor cells in the sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> without other indications for adjuvant systemic therapy might be candidates for axillary <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> dissection...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundSince the {{introduction}} of sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> biopsy, its use as a standard of care for patients with clinically node-negative cutaneous melanoma remains controversial. Our experience of sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> biopsy for melanoma is presented and evaluated. Material and methodsA cohort study was conducted on 69 patients with a primary cutaneous melanoma and with no clinical evidence of metastasis, who had sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> biopsy from October- 2005 to December- 2013. Sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> biopsy was identified using preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and subsequent intraoperative detection with gamma probe. ResultsThe sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> biopsy identification rate was 98. 5 %. The sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> biopsy was positive for metastases in 23 patients (33. 8 %). Postoperative complications after sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> biopsy were observed in 4. 4 % compared to 38 % of complications in patients who had complete lymphadenectomy. ConclusionThe sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> biopsy in melanoma offers useful information about the lymphatic dissemination of melanoma and allows an approximation to the regional staging, sparing the secondary effects of lymphadenectomy. More studies with larger number of patients and long term follow-up {{will be necessary to}} confirm the validity of sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> biopsy in melanoma patients, and especially of lymphadenectomy in patients with positive sentinel <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> biopsy...|$|R
