This note {{describes the}} foraging behaviour {{of a mixed}} flock of Balearic and <b>Levantine</b> <b>shearwaters,</b> observed {{during the month of}} January, just off the coast of Mallorca. The birds moved in a group and dived in the sea with hthe wings partially folded. A second immersion on the same spot started on the sea surface, but then the birds had their heads underwater looking for a potential prey. The wings were beaten underwater. Sometimes the depth reached was a few centimetres under the surface, but also, depths of up to two metres were reached. The maximum period underwater was 30 seconds, and all the prey was swallowed before surfacing...|$|R

The most striking case was that of Balearic shearwaters Puffinus mauretanicus, formerly considered a subspecies of <b>Levantine</b> <b>shearwaters</b> P. yelkouan. After a Life-Nature Project dealing with several conservation aspects of the species and lasting for four years, the information suitable to use with IUCN criterions was sadly very little. Let me give you some examples: does the population decrease more than 90 % in the last 10 years or three generations? To respond this question, a further (and without response either) question aroused: how many years represent a generation time in Balearic shearwaters? Is distribution area lower than 100 km 2 ? What is a “location” in a species such as Balearic shearwaters: a sea cliff, a cave, an islet, a whole archipelago? With the information available at that moment, the species could only be classified as “Vulnerable”, the Faits de conservation en Méditerranée Mediterranean Conservation News Figure. Time of extinction of Balearic shearwaters {{for the whole world}} population through simulated Monte Carlo population trajectories. Solid line shows the mean trajectory with estimated adult survival at the study colonies, and dashed line with a theoretical adult survival for the species of 0. 90. Bars represent two times the standard deviation (2 σ) of the mean, and dots the maximum and minimum population value for each time step...|$|R
