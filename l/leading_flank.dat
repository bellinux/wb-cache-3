40|$|We {{conducted}} numerical {{experiments to}} simulate elastoplastic deformation of the overriding plate {{caused by a}} subducted seamount. Calculations revealed development of a distinct pair of fault-like shear zones, including a landward dipping forethrust fault initiated from the seamount top and a seaward dipping backthrust fault from the landward base of the seamount. Significant dome-shaped surface uplift was predicted above the thrust faults. Lesser-developed seaward dipping backthrust faults were calculated to develop under certain conditions. The overriding plate was calculated to deform in two stages: In Stage I, elastic deformation leads {{to the formation of}} fault-like shear zones. After major faults have cut through the entire plate, plastic deformation on faults dominates Stage II. On the subduction interface, compressional normal stress was calculated to increase on the landward <b>leading</b> <b>flank</b> of the seamount and decrease on the seaward trailing flank. These changes, together with associated stress singularities at seamount edges, could affect earthquake processes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{temporal}} and spatial trends of cephalothorax length and reproductive state of adult females of the cosmopolitan copepod species Nannocalanus minor are described across the Gulf Stream near Cape Hatteras, NC. Consistent regional differences and a cross-stream gradient in size were found, with the largest animals in the Slope Water, animals of intermediate size in the Gulf Stream and the smallest animals in the Sargasso Sea. Distinct seasonal patterns in size were observed within each cross-stream region (Slope Water, Gulf Stream and Sargasso Sea) and these patterns followed seasonal changes in environmental conditions (temperature and sea surface pigment concentration). Body sizes of the Slope Water animals were inversely and linearly related to temperature with no dear relationship to sea surface pigment concentration, while body sizes of the Sargasso Sea animals were correlated with pigment concentration (asymptotic, non-linear relationship) with no relationship to temperature. The lack of consistent regional and seasonal trends in reproductive state suggested that continuous reproduction was a life history trait for adults of this species. The potential effect of short-term, episodic events on the size distribution and reproductive state of this species was investigated across and along a Gulf Stream meander during the BIOSYNOP project in 1988. Upwelling of nutrients may occur on the trailing flank of a meander, with enhanced primary and, possibly, secondary production occurring downstream in the <b>leading</b> <b>flank</b> of the meander. No specific meander effect was observed for body size. More individuals were reproducing downstream of the upwelling region, suggesting {{a response to the}} enhanced primary production characteristic of the upwelling region...|$|E
40|$|At the North-Ecuadorian {{convergent}} margin (1 degrees S- 1. 5 degrees N), the subduction of {{the rough}} Nazca oceanic plate leads to tectonic erosion of the upper plate and complex seismogenic behavior of the megathrust. We used three selected pre-stack depth migrated, multi-channel seismic reflection lines collected during the SISTEUR cruise to investigate the margin structure and decipher {{the impact of the}} subducted Atacames seamounts on tectonic erosion, interseismic coupling, and seismogenesis in the region of the 1942 Mw 7. 8 earthquake. This dataset highlights a subducted similar to 30 x 40 km, double-peak seamount that belongs to the Atacames seamount chain and that is associated with a deep morphologic re-entrant containing mass transport deposits. The seamount subduction uplifted the margin basement by similar to 1. 6 km and pervasively broke the margin by deep and intense reverse faulting ahead of the seamount, a process that is likely to weaken considerably the margin. In the seamount wake, the basement reverse fault system rotated counter-clockwise. This faulted basement is overlain with slope sediment sliding along listric normal faults that sole out onto the BSR. This superposition of deep tectonic contraction within the basement and shallow gravitational extension deformation within the sediment highlights the key role of gas hydrate on outer slope erosion. In addition to long-term regional basal erosion, the margin basement has thinned locally by an extra 0. 8 - 1 km in response to the subduction of the Atacames seamount chain and hydrofracturing by overpressured fluids at the margin toe. This pervasively and deeply fractured margin segment is associated with a seismically quiet and GPS-modeled low interseismic coupling corridor that terminates downdip near the 1942 epicenter and locked zone. We suggest that the deeply buried double-peak Atacames seamount triggered the 1942 earthquake ahead of its <b>leading</b> <b>flank.</b> This result supports previous studies proposing that subducted seamounts provide unfavorable conditions for locking the updip segment of the plate boundary limiting the updip extent of seismogenic zones, but may favor large subduction earthquakes at greater depths...|$|E

40|$|Fredrickson's (2001) broaden {{and build}} theory {{describes}} how experiencing positive emotions, such as happiness, broadens our 'thought-action repertoire' leading {{us to be}} more likely to go out and act on our positive emotions. This results in the building of new relationships, resources and skills, which we can draw on in times of need throughout life. In contrast, the experience of negative emotion is thought to narrow our 'thought-action repertoire', leading to specific actions to aid in survival (Fredrickson, 2001). The current experiments aimed to explore the effect of briefly presented schematic faces (happy, sad, and neutral) on attentional scope using the flanker task.

40|$|Volcanic edifices {{are often}} unable {{to support their}} own load, {{triggering}} the instability of their flanks. Many analogue models have been aimed, especially in the last decade, at understanding the processes <b>leading</b> to volcano <b>flank</b> instability; general behaviors were defined and the experimental results were compared to nature. However, available data at well-studied unstable volcanoes may allow {{a deeper understanding of}} the specific processes leading to instability, providing insights also at the local scale. Etna (Italy) constitutes a suitable example for such a possibility, because of its well-monitored flank instability, for which different triggering factors have been proposed in the last two decades. Among these factors, recent InSAR data highlight the role played by magmatic intrusions and a weak basement, under a differential unbuttressing at the volcano base. This study considers original and recently published experimental data to test these factors possibly responsible for flank instability, with the final aim to better understand and summarize the conditions <b>leading</b> to <b>flank</b> instability at Etna. In particular, we simulate the following processes: a) the longterm activity of a lithospheric boundary, as the Malta Escarpment, separating the Ionian oceanic lithosphere from the continental Sicilian lithosphere, below the most unstable east flank of the volcano; b) spreading due to a weak basement, with different boundary conditions; c) the pressurization of a magmatic reservoir, as that active during the 1994 ‚Äì 2001 inflation period; d) dike emplacement, as observed during the major 2001 and 2002 ‚Äì 2003 eruptions. The experimental results suggest that: 1) the long-term activity of a lithospheric tectonic boundary may create a topographic slope which provides a differential buttressing at the volcano base, a preparing factor to drive longer-term (> 105 years) instability on the east flank of the volcano; 2) volcano spreading (b 104 years) has limited effect on flank instability at Etna; 3) magmatic intrusions (b 101 years), both in the form of Mogi-like sources or dikes, provide the most important conditions to trigger flank instability on the shorter-term...|$|R

The 3rd Bombay European Regiment fought on and by the evening, although with vastly superior numbers, the forces of Tantia Tope was beaten and dispersed with fatal casualties exceeding one thousand men. Total British losses were fifteen killed in action, of which two were from the 3rd Bombay European Regiment and sixty-six wounded including three from the 3rd Bombay European Regiment.|$|R
5|$|The 30th Infantry Division {{began its}} advance on 2 October, using divisional heavy {{artillery}} to target German pillboxes; {{even then it}} took, on average, thirty minutes to capture a single pillbox. The Americans found that if they failed to immediately press {{on to the next}} pillbox, the Germans were sure to counterattack. Heavy resistance had not been expected, and one company lost 87 combatants in an hour; another lost 93 out of 120soldiers to a German artillery strike. The attackers were slowly able to cross the Wurm River and engage German pillboxes with flamethrowers and explosive charges. By the afternoon of 2 October, elements of the 30th Infantry Division had breached German defenses and reached the town of Palenberg. Here, GIs advanced house-to-house and fought a number of gruesome hand grenade duels. (Private Harold G. Kiner would be awarded the Medal of Honor for throwing himself on a German grenade near Palenberg, thus saving the lives of two fellow soldiers). Fighting in the town of Rimburg was equally terrible; American armor {{had not been able to}} get across the Wurm River, and therefore could not provide fire support to infantrymen who were attempting to storm a medieval castle being used as a fort by the Germans. The 30th Infantry Division subdued roughly 50 German pillboxes on the first day of the advance, often having to envelop the structure and attack from the rear. The division's effort was aided by the 29th Infantry Division's diversionary attacks on their <b>flank,</b> <b>leading</b> the Germans to believe that that was the Americans' main attack. On the night of 2 October, the German 902nd Assault Gun Battalion was ordered to launch a counterattack against the 30th Infantry Division, but Allied artillery delayed the start of the raid, and ultimately the attempt failed.|$|R
40|$|On 10 October 2011, a rain-on-snow flood {{occurred}} in the Bernese Alps, Switzerland, and caused significant damage. As this flood peak was unpredicted by the flood forecast system, questions were raised concerning what has caused this flood and whether it was predictable at all. In this study, we focused on one valley that was heavily hit by the event, the Loetschen valley (160 km 2), and aimed to reconstruct the anatomy of this rain-on-snow flood from the synoptic conditions represented by European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ECWMF analysis data, and the local meteorology within the valley recorded by an extensive met-station network. In addition, we applied the hydrological model WaSiM-ETH to improve our hydrological process understanding about this event and to demonstrate the predictability of this rain-on-snow flood. We found an atmospheric river bringing moist and warm air to Switzerland that followed an anomalous cold front with sustained snowfall to be central for this rain-on-snow event. Intensive rainfall (average 100 mm day ‚àí 1) {{was accompanied by a}} drastic temperature increase (+ 8 K) that shifted the zero degree line from 1500 m a. s. l. to 3200 m a. s. l. in 12 h. The northern flank of the valley received significantly more precipitation than the southern <b>flank,</b> <b>leading</b> to an enormous flood in tributaries along the northern flank, while the tributaries along the southern flank remained nearly unchanged. We hypothesized that the reason for this was a cavity circulation combined with a seeder-feeder-cloud system enhancing both local rainfall and snow melt by condensation of the warm, moist air on the snow. Applying and adjusting the hydrological model, we show that both the latent and the sensible heat fluxes were responsible for the flood and that locally large amounts of precipitation (up to 160 mm rainfall in 12 h) was necessary to produce the estimated flood peak. With considerable adjustments to the model and meteorological input data, we were able to reproduce the flood peak, demonstrating the ability of the model to reproduce the flood. However, driving the optimized model with COSMO- 2 forecast data, we still failed to simulate the flood precisely because COSMO- 2 forecast data underestimated both the local precipitation peak and the temperature increase. Thus, this rain-on-snow flood was predictable, but requires a special model set up and extensive and locally precise meteorological input data, especially in terms of both precipitation and temperature...|$|R
50|$|In 1994, as a {{freshman}} at West Virginia University, Saunders redshirted and played on the scout team. In 1995, as a redshirt freshman, Saunders earned the starting role at flanker. He ended the season as the team's leading receiver with 38 catches for 682 yards and five touchdowns, setting a school-record for freshman receiving yards and touchdowns. He began his career against Purdue, where he had 130 yards from six receptions. He scored his first career touchdown against East Carolina on a 50-yard reception, finishing the game with five receptions for 99 yards. He also recorded 149 yards against Rutgers, 94 yards against Miami, and 80 yards against Pitt to end the season in the Backyard Brawl. In 1996 season, his sophomore season, Saunders finished the year as a First-team All-Big East selection. He led the conference {{with an average of}} 83 yards receiving and 6.1 receptions-per-game. He started every game of the season as a <b>flanker,</b> <b>leading</b> the team with 76 receptions for 1,043 yards and five touchdowns, becoming the first player in school history to gain over 1,000 yards receiving in a season. Against East Carolina, he recorded eight receptions for 105 yards, followed by 191 yards and one touchdown against Boston College, which ranks third on the school's receiving yards in a single game list. He gained 113 yards against Syracuse, followed by 178 yards against Rutgers and 130 yards against North Carolina in the Gator Bowl, which earned him MVP honors. In 1997, his junior year, Saunders did not play, but returned for his senior season. In 1998, he earned Second-team All-Big East and First-team All-ECAC honors.

40|$|We modeled the {{geometrical}} roughening of bedding-parallel, mainly layer-dominated stylolites {{in order}} to understand their structural evolution, to present an advanced classification of stylolite shapes and to relate this classification to chemical compaction and permeability variations at stylolites. Stylolites are rough dissolution seams that develop in sedimentary basins during chemical compaction. In the Zechstein 2 carbonate units, an important lean gas reservoir in the southern Permian Zechstein basin in Germany, stylolites influence local fluid flow, mineral replacement reactions and hence the permeability of the reservoir. Our simulations demonstrate that layer-dominated stylolites can grow in three distinct stages: an initial slow nucleation phase, a fast layer-pinning phase and a final freezing phase if the layer is completely dissolved during growth. Dissolution of the pinning layer and thus destruction of the stylolite's compaction tracking capabilities {{is a function of the}} background noise in the rock and the dissolution rate of the layer itself. Low background noise needs a slower dissolving layer for pinning to be successful but produces flatter teeth than higher background noise. We present an advanced classification based on our simulations and separate stylolites into four classes: (1) rectangular layer type, (2) seismogram pinning type, (3) suture/sharp peak type and (4) simple wave-like type. Rectangular layer type stylolites are the most appropriate for chemical compaction estimates because they grow linearly and record most of the actual compaction (up to 40 mm in the Zechstein example). Seismogram pinning type stylolites also provide good tracking capabilities, with the largest teeth tracking most of the compaction. Suture/sharp peak type stylolites grow in a non-linear fashion and thus do not record most of the actual compaction. However, when a non-linear growth law is used, the compaction estimates are similar to those making use of the rectangular layer type stylolites. Simple wave-like stylolites are not useful for compaction estimates, since their growth is highly non-linear with a very low growth exponent. In the case where sealing material is collected at the tooth during dissolution, stylolites can act as barriers for local fluid flow as they intensify sealing capabilities of pinning layers. However, the development of teeth and spikes offsets and thus destroys continuous stylolite seams so that the permeability across the stylolite becomes very heterogeneous and they are no continuous barriers. This behavior is best shown in rectangular layer and seismogram pinning type stylolites that develop efficient fluid barriers at teeth tips but destroy sealing capabilities of layers by offsetting them at the <b>flank,</b> <b>leading</b> to a permeability anisotropy along 2 -D stylolite planes. Suture/sharp peak stylolites can create fluid barriers if they collect enough sealing material. However, if the collecting material does not seal or if spikes offset the sealing material the stylolite leaks. We propose that our classification can be used to realistically estimate chemical compaction in reservoirs and gives an indication on how heterogeneous the permeability of stylolites can be...|$|R
