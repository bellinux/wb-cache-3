40|$|Helicobacter pylori is a {{bacterial}} pathogen specialised to colonise and persist the gastric mucosa and to cause severe gastroduodenal disease. A major disease-associated bacterial component {{is a type}} IV secretion system (TFSS) encoded by the cytotoxin-associated genes pathogenicity island (cagPAI). Among the multiple responses in H. pylori-infected epithelial cells, the induction of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, cell spreading and motility associated with the "hum mingbird" phenotype appear strictly dependent on the functional transporter complex in the cagPAI. H. pylori is also capable of occasionally entering epithelial cells and manipulates the host immune system for immune evasion. Attached bacteria actively translocate the CagA protein into epithelial cells by a TFSS-dependent process and translocated CagA undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in the carboxy terminal EPIYA sequence repeat motif (Y- 972) by kinases of the Src family. Furthermore, we have identified a novel TFSS in H. pylori involved in horizontal DNA-transfer. Host cell signalling events and cellular phenotypes provoked by the cagPAI, the investigation of mechanisms related to gastric cancer {{as well as the}} development of a Salmonella based <b>live</b> <b>recombinant</b> <b>vaccine</b> are in the focus of additional departmental activities...|$|E

In contrast, in cells infected with recombinant virus v 52 ̆ 7 C-NS 2 A (coding for 52 ̆ 7 NCR and C-prM-E-NS 1 -NS 2 A regions) expression of NS 1 protein was greatly reduced and no E protein was detected, Immunization of mice with vC-NS 3 induced high levels of TBEV-specific antibodies and protected them against intraperitoneal challenge with 10 (7) LD(50) of TBEV. The level of protection was very similar to the level of protection achieved by immunization with commercially available inactivated TBEV vaccine, Although the immunization of mice with recombinants vC-NS 1 and v 52 ̆ 7 C-NS 2 A induced much lower levels of TBEV-specific antibodies, they were still protected against intraperitoneal challenge with 10 (4) and 10 (3. 6) LD(50) of TBEV, respectively. The high level of protection against TBEV infection achieved by the immunization of mice with the recombinant vaccinia virus vC-NS 3 makes this virus a very attractive candidate for development of a <b>live</b> <b>recombinant</b> <b>vaccine</b> against TBEV...|$|E
40|$|A {{major goal}} of current vaccine {{development}} is the induction of strong immune responses against protective antigens delivered by mucosal routes. One {{of the most promising}} approaches in that respect relies on the use of <b>live</b> <b>recombinant</b> <b>vaccine</b> carriers. In this study, Mycobacterium bovis BCG was engineered to produce an intracellular glutathione S-transferase from Schistosoma haematobium (Sh 28 GST). The gene encoding Sh 28 GST was placed {{under the control of the}} mycobacterial hsp 60 promoter on a replicative shuttle plasmid containing a mercury resistance operon as the only selectable marker. The recombinant Sh 28 GST produced in BCG bound glutathione and expressed enzymatic activity, indicating that its active site was properly folded. Both intraperitoneal and intranasal immunizations of BALB/c mice with the recombinant BCG resulted in strong anti-Sh 28 GST antibody responses, which were enhanced by a boost. Mice immunized intranasally produced a mixed response with the production of Sh 28 GST-specific immunoglobulin G 1 (IgG 1), IgG 2 a, IgG 2 b, and IgA in the serum. In addition, high levels of anti-Sh 28 GST IgA were also found in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, demonstrating that intranasal delivery of the recombinant BCG was able to induce long-lasting secretory and systemic immune responses to antigens expressed intracellularly. Surprisingly, intranasal immunization with the BCG producing the Sh 28 GST induced a much stronger specific humoral response than intranasal immunization with BCG producing the glutathione S-transferase from Schistosoma mansoni, although the two antigens have over 90 % identity. This difference was not observed after intraperitoneal administration...|$|E

40|$|Rabies is a fatal viral {{zoonosis}} that {{is transmitted}} by bite contact with saliva of an infected animal. In the U. S., human deaths are rare, but each year over 5, 000 rabid animals are reported and over 90 % of cases are from wildlife. Multiple species of carnivores and bats {{are the primary}} sylvatic reservoirs in the U. S., and several variants circulate independently among these two taxonomic orders. Rabies prevention efforts led by USDA APHIS Wildlife Services using <b>live</b> <b>recombinant</b> <b>vaccine</b> baiting began in 1995 and currently target raccoons and canids, but {{the territory of the}} south-central skunk rabies virus variant has been expanding in recent years, leading to incursions into areas previously free of carnivore rabies. Colorado has been one such area, where multiple species of bats were the main rabies reservoir prior to 2007. By 2012, the number of rabid striped skunks exceeded rabid bats in Colorado. Larimer County and Weld County, in Northern Colorado, both witnessed skunk rabies epizootics starting in 2012 that have continued through 2013. Despite spillover events into raccoons, red foxes, companion animals, and livestock during 2012 and 2013, no other host species appears to support independent circulation of the south-central skunk variant in Northern Colorado. Virus isolation from salivary glands of rabid animals will help to quantify the likelihood for secondary transmission from spillover hosts and guide intervention strategies targeting wildlife.

40|$|Poliovirus {{has been}} studied as a <b>live</b> <b>recombinant</b> <b>vaccine</b> vector because of its {{attractive}} characteristics. The genetic instability, however, has hampered recombinant polioviruses (PVs) from being developed as an appropriate vaccine. A variety of different foreign inserts were cloned directly into our poliovirus Sabin 1 -based RPS-Vax vector system, resulting {{in the production of}} recombinant PVs. The genetic stability of each recombinant PV was examined during 12 rounds of consecutive passage. It was found that the genetic stability of the recombinants was not well correlated with their insert size. Instead, elevated stability was frequently observed in recombinants with inserts of high G/C contents. Furthermore, a comparative study using different constructs of the human immunodeficiency virus env gene revealed that the internal deletion of the unstable insert was seemingly caused by the presence of the adjacent A/T-rich region. The instability of these inserts was completely remedied by (i) increasing the G/C contents and (ii) replacing the local A/T-rich region with the G/C-rich codon without a change of the amino acid. This means that stability is closely associated with the G/C content and the G/C distribution pattern. To see whether these findings {{can be applied to the}} design of genetically stable recombinant PV, we have reconstructed the heteromultimeric insert based on our design architecture, including the above-mentioned G/C rules and the template/ligation-free PCR protocol. The heteromultimeric insert was very unstable, as expected, but the manipulated insert with the same amino acid sequence showed complete genetic stability, not only in vitro, but also in vivo. Even though this guideline was established with our RPS-Vax vector system, to some extent, it can also be applied to other live viral vaccine vectors...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{vaccine that}} was based on secreted proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was investigated in a mouse model of tuberculosis. I used a short-term culture filtrate (ST-CF) containing proteins secreted from actively replicating bacteria grown under defined culture conditions. The immunogenicity of the ST-CF was investigated in combination with different adjuvants, and peak proliferative responses were observed when ST-CF was administered with the surface-active agent dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride. The immunity induced by this vaccine was dose dependent, and, in the optimal concentration, the vaccine induced a potent T-helper 1 response which efficiently protected the animals against a subsequent challenge with virulent M. tuberculosis. Antigenic targets for the T cells generated were mapped by employing narrow-molecular-weight fractions of ST-CF. The experimental vaccine primed a broadly defined T-cell repertoire directed to multiple secreted antigens present in ST-CF. A vaccination with viable Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), in contrast, induced a restricted T-cell reactivity directed to two secreted protein fractions with molecular masses of 5 to 12 and 25 to 35 kDa. The protective efficacy of the ST-CF vaccine was compared with that of a BCG standard vaccine, and both induced a highly significant protection of equal magnitude. The vaccination with ST-CF gave rise to a population of long-lived CD 4 cells which could be isolated 22 weeks after the vaccination and could adoptively transfer acquired resistance to T-cell-deficient recipients. My results confirm the hypothesis that M. tuberculosis cells release protective antigens during growth. The high efficacy of a subunit vaccine observed in the present study is discussed as a possible alternative to a <b>live</b> <b>recombinant</b> <b>vaccine</b> carrier...|$|E

40|$|Mycobacterium bovis {{infection}} of cattle and other domesticated animals exacts a significant economic toll in both economically developing and industrialized countries. Vaccination of herds and/or wild animals that share their grazing land {{and serve as}} reservoirs of infection has been proposed as a strategy to combat bovine tuberculosis. However, the only currently available vaccine, M. bovis Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), is not highly efficacious. Here we show that a <b>live</b> <b>recombinant</b> <b>vaccine,</b> rBCG 30, which expresses large amounts of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis 30 kDa major secretory protein, is more efficacious against bovine tuberculosis than BCG in the highly demanding guinea pig model of pulmonary tuberculosis. Compared with the parental wild-type BCG strain, rBCG 30 administered intradermally induced significantly greater cell-mediated and humoral immune responses against the 30 kDa protein, as determined by measuring cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity and antibody titers. As for potency, in three independent experiments, rBCG 30 induced greater protective immunity than BCG against aerosol challenge with a highly virulent strain of M. bovis, reducing the burden of M. bovis by 0. 4 +/- 0. 2 log colony-forming units (CFU) in the lung (P < 0. 05) and by 1. 1 +/- 0. 4 log CFU in the spleen (P = 0. 0005) below the level in BCG-immunized animals. A recombinant BCG vaccine overexpressing the identical M. bovis 30 kDa protein, rBCG 30 Mb, also induced greater cell-mediated and humoral immunity against the 30 kDa protein than BCG and greater protective immunity against M. bovis challenge; however, its potency was {{not significantly different from}} rBCG 30. As rBCG 30 is significantly more potent than BCG against M. bovis challenge, it has potential as a vaccine against bovine tuberculosis in domesticated animals and in wild animal reservoirs.

40|$|Human infections with EHEC such as O 157 :H 7 {{have been}} a great concern for {{worldwide}} food-industry surveillance. This pathogen is commonly associated with bloody diarrhea that can evolve to the life-threatening hemolytic uremic syndrome. Animals are the natural reservoir where this pathogen remains asymptomatically, in steps of ingestion and colonization of the bowel. The bacterium is shed in the feces, contaminating the surroundings, including water and food that are directed for human consumption. A major player in this colonization process is intimin, an outer membrane adhesion molecule encoded by the E. coli attachment and effacement (eae) gene that {{has been shown to be}} essential for intimate bacterial attachment to eukaryotic host cells. In an attempt to reduce the colonization of animal reservoirs with EHEC O 157 :H 7, we designed a vaccine model to induce an immune response against intimin gamma. The model is based on its recombinant expression in attenuated Salmonella, used as a suitable vaccine vector because of its recognized ability to deliver recombinant antigens and to elicit all forms of immunity: mucosal, systemic, and humoral responses. To test this model, mice were orally immunized with a S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain carrying the pYA 3137 eaeA vector, and challenged with E. coli O 157 :H 7. Here we show that immunization induced the production of high levels of specific IgG and IgA antibodies and promoted reduction in the fecal shedding of EHEC after challenge.

40|$|Detection of {{classical}} swine fever virus (CSFV) {{can be achieved by}} a range of assays of which the most commonly used are: immunohistochemical and virus culture techniques. New developments have enabled the detection of viral proteins by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and the detection of the viral genome by RT- PCR. So far, laboratory findings show that the latter assays may supplement or replace the conventional techniques in the near future. The detection of serum antibody against structural and non-structural proteins of CSFV has been improved by developments in recombinant DNA techniques and has lead to a range of ELISAs. Although the characteristics of these ELISAs are excellent, positive results still need to be confirmed in the virus neutralization test. The available amount of sequence data enables diagnosticians to type strains of CSFV as different by comparing several parts of the genome. In some cases, this can provide conclusive evidence if a primary or secondary outbreak has been detected. Increased efforts focused on the retrieval of relevant data on the introduction of CSFV in a pig holding and the spread of CSFV in- and between pig holding(s) has generated more insight into the epizootiology of the disease. A successful control and eradication programme for {{classical swine fever}} (CSF) can consist of zoosanitary measures and/or vaccination. The latter can compromise the export of live pigs and pig products considerably unless marker vaccines have been used. Several studies were performed to determine the efficacy of an E 2 subunit vaccine and <b>live</b> <b>recombinant</b> <b>vaccine</b> candidates. Firstly, we determined the 95 % protective dose of an E 2 subunit vaccine at 32 μg E 2 per dosage after a single application. Further studies with a single administration of the subunit vaccine showed that: the vaccine was stable for a prolonged period after production, was able to reduce horizontal and vertical transmission of CSFV among vaccinated pigs, and provided protection for at least 6 months. An Erns antibody discriminatory assay was developed for use in combination with the subunit vaccine. Evaluation of the E(rns) ELISA showed that the sensitivity of the assay was lower than but that the specificity was equal to that of existing antibody assays. Two live recombinant marker vaccines were evaluated for the induction of clinical protection and reduction of transmission of CSFV shortly after vaccination. Results showed that these vaccines provided good clinical protection 1 week after a single vaccination.

40|$|A vector for the {{expression}} of foreign antigens in the vaccine strain Brucella abortus S 19 was developed by using a DNA fragment containing the regulatory sequences and the signal peptide of the Brucella bcsp 31 gene.

40|$|Several {{recent studies}} have {{demonstrated}} that strong cellular or humoral immune responses can be induced against foreign antigens expressed by recombinant Mycobacterium bovis BCG. It has therefore been suggested that BCG could represent one of the best candidate vectors for <b>live</b> <b>recombinant</b> <b>vaccines.</b> However, {{a large percentage of the}} human population has been immunized by BCG, and this priming could modify the immune response to future <b>recombinant</b> BCG <b>vaccines.</b> In the present study, we have therefore compared the immune responses induced in naive and BCG-primed mice by two <b>recombinant</b> BCG <b>vaccines</b> expressing either beta-galactosidase or human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Nef antigens. Our results demonstrated that BCG priming limits the growth of recombinant BCG in mouse spleen or lymph nodes. This reduction in BCG growth was associated with decreased proliferative responses against Nef or beta-galactosidase antigens. This suppression, however, never exceeded 50 %. Interestingly, in contrast to these reduced T-cell responses, BCG-primed mice developed high levels of anti-beta-galactosidase antibodies after immunization with recombinant BCG expressing this antigen. This stimulation of antibody responses was not due to polyclonal stimulation or to a nonspecific adjuvant effect of BCG. The isotypic patterns of anti-beta-galactosidase antibody responses induced by the recombinant BCG were similar in naive and BCG-primed mice.

Finding indicated that immunization with L. tarentolae tarentolae -KMP 11 -NTGP 96 -GFP provides significant protection against visceral leishmaniasis and was able to induce an increased expression of IFN-γ and IgG 2 a. Following challenge, a reduced parasite load in the spleen of the KMP 11 -NTGP 96 -GFP immunized group was detected. Conclusion: The present study is the first to use a combination of a Leishmania antigen with an immunologic antigen in <b>live</b> <b>recombinant</b> L. tarentolae and results suggest that L. tarentolae -KMP 11 -NTGP 96 -GFP could be considered as a potential tool in vaccination against visceral leishmaniasis and this vaccination strategy could provide a potent rout for future vaccine development.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Regulated antigen {{expression}} {{can influence}} the immunogenicity of <b>live</b> <b>recombinant</b> Salmonella <b>vaccines,</b> but a rational optimization has remained difficult since important aspects of this effect are incompletely understood. Here, attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SL 3261 strains expressing the model antigen GFP_OVA were used to quantify in vivo antigen levels by flow cytometry and to simultaneously follow the crucial early steps of antigen-specific T-cell responses in mice that are transgenic for a T-cell receptor recognizing ovalbumin. Among seven tested promoters, P(pagC) has the highest activity in murine tissues combined with low in vitro expression, whereas P(tac) has a comparable in vivo and a very high in vitro activity. Both SL 3261 (pP(pagC) GFP_OVA) and SL 3261 (pP(tac) GFP_OVA) cells can induce potent ovalbumin-specific cellular immune responses following oral administration, but doses almost 1, 000 -fold lower are sufficient for the in vivo-inducible construct SL 3261 (pP(pagC) GFP_OVA) compared to SL 3261 (pP(tac) GFP_OVA). This efficacy difference is largely explained by impaired early colonization capabilities of SL 3261 (pP(tac) GFP_OVA) cells. Based {{on the findings of}} this study, appropriate in vivo expression levels for any given antigen can be rationally selected from the increasing set of promoters with defined properties. This will allow the improvement of <b>recombinant</b> Salmonella <b>vaccines</b> against a wide range of pathogens...|$|R

This recombinant virus, designated rA 2 cp, appears to replicate less efficiently in {{the upper and lower}} respiratory tracts of seronegative chimpanzees than either biologically derived or recombinant wild-type RSV. Infection with rA 2 cp also resulted in significantly less rhinorrhea and cough than infection with wild-type RSV. These findings confirm the role of the cp mutations in attenuation of RSV and identify their usefulness for inclusion in future <b>live</b> attenuated <b>recombinant</b> RSV <b>vaccine</b> candidates...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY : Anthrax, an {{uncommon}} disease in humans, {{is caused by}} a large bacterium, Bacillus anthracis. The risk of inhalation infection is the main indication for anthrax vaccination. Pre-exposure vaccination is provided by an acellular vaccine (anthrax vaccine adsorbed or AVA), which contains anthrax toxin elements and results in protective immunity after 3 to 6 doses. Anthrax vaccine precipitated (AVP) is administered at primovaccination in 3 doses with a booster dose after 6 months. To evoke and maintain protective immunity, it is necessary to administer a booster dose once at 12 months. In Russia, live spore vaccine (STI) has been used in a two-dose schedule. Current anthrax vaccines show considerable local and general reactogenicity (erythema, induration, soreness, fever). Serious adverse reactions occur in about 1 &#x 0025; of vaccinations. New second-generation vaccines in current research programs include <b>recombinant</b> <b>live</b> <b>vaccines</b> and <b>recombinant</b> sub-unit <b>vaccines...</b>|$|R
40|$|Adenovirus vectors are {{extensively}} {{used for}} high-level expression of proteins in mammalian cells and are receiving increasing attention for their potential use as <b>live</b> <b>recombinant</b> <b>vaccines</b> and as transducing viruses {{for use in}} gene therapy. Although it is commonly argued {{that one of the}} chief advantages of adenovirus vectors is their relative stability, this has not been thoroughly investigated. To examine the genetic stability of adenovirus type 5 vectors and in particular {{to examine the relationship between}} genetic stability and genome size, adenovirus vectors were constructed with inserts of 4. 88 (herpes simplex virus type 1 gB), 4. 10 (herpes simplex virus type 1 gB), or 3. 82 (LacZ) kb combined with a 1. 88 -kb E 3 deletion or with a newly generated 2. 69 -kb E 3 deletion. The net excess of DNA over the wild-type (wt) genome size ranged from 1. 13 to 3. 00 kb or 3. 1 to 8. 3 %. Analysis of these vectors during serial passage in tissue culture revealed that when the size exceeded 105 % of the wt genome length by approximately 1. 2 kb (4. 88 -kb insert combined with a 1. 88 -kb deletion), the resulting vector grew very poorly and underwent rapid rearrangement, resulting in loss of the insert after only a few passages. In contrast, vectors with inserts resulting in viral DNA close to or less than a net genome size of 105 % of that of the wt grew well and were relatively stable. In general, viruses with genomes only slightly above 105 % of that of the wt were unstable and the rapidity with which rearrangement occurred correlated with the size of the insert. These findings suggest that there is a relatively tight constraint on the amount of DNA which can be packaged into virions and that exceeding the limit results in a sharply decreased rate of virus growth. The resultant strong selection for variants which have undergone rearrangement, generating smaller genomes, is manifested as genetic instability of the virus population...|$|R
40|$|An {{attenuated}} {{vaccinia virus}} mutant with specific genetic lesions {{has been used}} to develop a vehicle for safer <b>live</b> <b>recombinant</b> virus <b>vaccines.</b> The mutant virus 48 - 7 has an 8 -MDa deletion starting 2. 2 MDa from the left end of the viral genome and point mutations in the gene encoding the 14 -kDa fusion protein that determines the plaque-size phenotype of the virus. Using the highly sensitive reporter gene luciferase, we have shown that this mutant can generate recombinant viruses that infect cultured cells and animals with normal vaccinia virus tropism. Insertion of the envelope and gag genes of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 into the attenuated vaccinia mutant resulted in their efficient expression and precursor processing in infected cultured cells. Infection of mice with human immunodeficiency virus-vaccinia recombinant viruses elicited human immunodeficiency virus-specific antibodies. Using mice pretreated with cyclophosphamide as a model for immunosuppression, the reduced virulence of the mutant recombinant virus was clearly evident. These findings demonstrate that the highly attenuated vaccinia virus mutant 48 - 7 can be used to generate effective and safer vaccines...|$|R

Please click on the hyperlink in Additional Links fieldThe mucosae represent the primary point of contact between the major respiratory and enteric pathogens and the innate and adaptive immune response. The microanatomy and function of the mucosal immune system is now well-characterized, in particular the major effector mechanism that involves the production and translocation of secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA). Mucosal delivery of antigen {{has the potential to}} induce potent local and systemic immunity, although such responses may differ between neonatal, infant and adult mice. In younger animals mucosal immune responses are Th 2 biased, whereas in adults there is a broader Th 1 and Th 2 responsiveness. There is much interest in the development of mucosally delivered vaccines which can be tailored to enhance Th 1 immunity or to avoid potential interference from maternally derived antibodies (MDA). Accordingly, a range of mucosal adjuvants (particularly those derived from bacteria) has been tested, and <b>live</b> <b>recombinant</b> vectored <b>vaccines</b> may also be effectively delivered by this route...|$|R
40|$|The common marmoset, Callithrix jacchus, can be {{infected}} with human varicella-zoster virus (VZV), both wild-type strain KMcC and attenuated vaccine strain Oka/Merck. Infection was accomplished with either whole-cell-associated or cell extract VZV by combined oral-nasal-conjunctival application and {{was characterized by}} substantial and persistent anti-VZV antibody responses. The infectivity of VZV for marmosets was destroyed by treatment of inocula with heat or UV light. Diluted inocula with as few as 40 PFU/ml were infectious for marmosets. The lungs were demonstrated {{to be a major}} site of viral replication; both the presence of viral antigens and signs of pneumonia were demonstrated in lung tissues. Four serial passages of VZV KMcC were carried out in C. jacchus by a process of in vitro isolation and culturing of VZV from infected lung tissue and reapplication of the cultured isolates to fresh animals. The isolated viruses were identified as VZV both serologically and by restriction endonuclease analyses.
