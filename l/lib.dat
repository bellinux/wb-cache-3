5|$|The {{decoration}} {{of the opening}} few words of each Gospel was lavish. These pages were, in effect, turned into carpet pages. The {{decoration of}} these texts is so elaborate that the text itself is almost illegible. The opening page (folio 29r) of Matthew may stand as an example. (See illustration at left.) The page consists of only two words: Liber generationis ("The book of the generation"). The <b>lib</b> of Liber is turned into a giant monogram which dominates the entire page. The er of Liber is presented as an interlaced ornament within the b of the <b>lib</b> monogram. Generationis is broken into three lines and contained within an elaborate frame in the right lower quadrant of the page. The entire assemblage is contained within an elaborate border.|$|E

5|$|Boyd had {{her first}} {{encounter}} with LSD in early 1965 when the couple's dentist, John Riley, secretly laced her coffee with the drug during a dinner party at his home. As she {{was getting ready to}} leave with Harrison and John and Cynthia Lennon, Riley told them that he had spiked their drinks and tried to persuade them to stay. Outside, Boyd was in an agitated state from the drug and threatened to break a store window, but Harrison pulled her away.

On 27 March 1965, {{at a dinner party}} given by a dentist, John Riley, the Lennons, Harrison, and Boyd were given LSD without their knowledge. Although told not to leave the house, Harrison drove them to various nightclubs, with Riley following them by taxi. At the Ad <b>Lib</b> club, they thought the lift up to the club was on fire and started screaming, before finally crawling out of the lift for which Mick Jagger, Marianne Faithfull, and Starr were waiting. Harrison later drove them back home in Boyd's Mini Cooper at no more than 10mph, as he was also feeling the effects of the drug. They stayed up all night at Kenwood, experiencing the full effects of their first LSD trip.|$|E

40|$|Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} isolates with identical IS 6110 {{restriction fragment}} length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns {{are considered to}} originate from the same ancestral strain and thus to reflect ongoing transmission. In this study, we investigated 1, 277 IS 6110 RFLP patterns for the presence of multiple low-intensity bands (<b>LIBs),</b> which may indicate infections with multiple M. tuberculosis strains. We did not find any multiple <b>LIBs,</b> suggesting that multiple infections are rare in the Netherlands. However, we did observe a few <b>LIBs</b> in 94 patterns (7. 4 %) and examined the nature of this phenomenon. With single-colony cultures it was found that <b>LIBs</b> mostly represent mixed bacterial populations with slightly different RFLP patterns. Mixtures were expressed in RFLP patterns as <b>LIBs</b> when 10 to 30 % of the DNA analyzed originated from a bacterial population with another RFLP pattern. Presumably, a part of the <b>LIBs</b> did not represent mixed bacterial populations, as in some clusters all strains exhibited <b>LIBs</b> in their RFLP patterns. The occurrence of <b>LIBs</b> was associated with increased age in patients. This may reflect either a gradual change of the bacterial population in the human body over time or IS 6110 -mediated genetic adaptation of M. tuberculosis to changes in the environmental conditions during the dormant state or reactivation thereafter...|$|R

5|$|The first gambier {{and pepper}} {{plantations}} appeared in Southern Johor, notably Skudai. Lau <b>Lib</b> Keng, a Chinese settler based in Skudai, {{was the first}} person to receive a Surat Sungai, whereby the river banks of Skudai were leased to Lau for the cultivation of gambier and pepper. More Chinese settlers came to Johor from the 1850s onwards, and forested areas in Southern Johor such as Tebrau, Plentong and Stulang were cleared for the cultivation of gambier and pepper. By the time Temenggong Ibrahim's son, Abu Bakar took office from his father in 1862, at least 37 Surat Sungai have been issued to various Kangchu, all of whom were collectively responsible for the operations of the 1,200 gambier and pepper farms in the state. Most of these Chinese leaders were also members of secret societies, and communal warfare often broke out in Singapore between different dialect groups as a result of conflicting economic interests. From the late 1850s onwards, the Kangchu began to exert political influence in the state affairs by establishing close ties with Temenggong Abu Bakar. In 1865, Abu Bakar granted official recognition to the Teochew-dominated Johor branch of the Ngee Heng Kongsi after a Kangchu, Tan Kee Soon, raised a small army to subdue Sultan Ali's forces, from whom Abu Bakar was facing considerable dissent but was unable to raise an organised army. Abu Bakar nevertheless called for the Ngee Heng Kongsi to accept Chinese settlers of other dialect groups to prevent possible communal warfare as a result of conflicting economic interests.|$|E

This review describes a separator membrane, {{one of the key}} components in <b>LIBs,</b> in terms of porous structure and physicochemical properties, and its recent development trends are followed. The separator membrane is a kind of porous membrane that is positioned between a cathode and an anode. Its major functions involve electrical isolation between the electrodes while serving as an ionic transport channel that is filled with liquid electrolyte. The separator membranes are not directly involved in redox reactions of <b>LIBs,</b> however, their aforementioned roles significantly affect performance and safety of <b>LIBs.</b> A variety of research approaches have been recently conducted in separator membranes in order to further reinforce battery safeties and also widen chemical functionalities.

40|$|A state-of-charge (SOC) versus open-circuit-voltage (OCV) model {{developed}} for batteries should preferably be simple, especially for real-time SOC estimation.

To meet the increasing demand for energy storage, it is very urgent and crucial to develop next-generation <b>LIBs</b> using alternative electrode materials. For example, carbon is still exclusively used as anode materials in current <b>LIBs.</b> However, the theoretical capacity of graphite (372 mA h g– 1 based on LiC 6) has almost been achieved, and it becomes one of the bottlenecks to further increase the energy density of <b>LIBs</b> based on carbon. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop carbon-alternative materials with higher capacity to meet the increasing demand for energy storage. Iron oxides, with a theoretical capacity of 1007 mA h g– 1, have been attracting much attention as a promising candidate to replace carbon. However, poor capacity retention and poor conductivity are the main issues. One strategy is to design and tailor structured iron oxides to address those issues. In addition, it is always practically interesting and intellectually challenging to develop facile methods to prepare iron oxides with desired structures. In our work, iron oxides with various sizes and structures have been designed and synthesized.
