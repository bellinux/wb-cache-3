25|$|Another {{approach}} to humanistic counseling and therapy is Gestalt therapy, which puts {{a focus on}} the here and now, especially as an opportunity to <b>look</b> <b>past</b> any preconceived notions and focus on how the present is affected by the past. Role playing also plays a large role in Gestalt therapy and allows for a true expression of feelings that may not have been shared in other circumstances. In Gestalt therapy, non-verbal cues are an important indicator of how the client may actually be feeling, despite the feelings expressed.|$|E

The Daily Telegraph gave the series opener 4 out of 5 stars in a review, praising the {{shooting}} {{and the use of}} symbolism. The Independents Ellen E. Jones compared the series with the American miniseries Angels in America in regard to the spread and reaction to HIV/AIDS in the 1980s, finding the series' zeitgeist and character portraits to be strong, though the bildungsroman at the centre of the plot and generic characters were less inventive.|$|E
25|$|Claude McKay was a {{poet who}} flourished during the Harlem Renaissance, a major {{literary}} {{movement in the}} 1920s. During this time, McKay’s poems challenged white authority while celebrating Jamaican culture. He also wrote tales about the trials and tribulations {{of life as a}} black man in both Jamaica and America. McKay was not secretive about his hatred for racism and felt that racist people were stupid and could not <b>look</b> <b>past</b> their shortsightedness and hatred. In tales like Home to Harlem', McKay depicts a culture in Harlem that is full of drug use, prostitution, and a variety of sexual encounters. His depiction was criticized as a negative portrayal of Harlem and its lower-class citizens by prominent figures such as W.E.B. DuBois, but was later applauded as a literary force in the Harlem Renaissance. McKay’s poetry brought awareness to the racist treatment that many black individuals faced.|$|E

25|$|At his death, Wren was 90 (N.S.). Even {{the men he}} {{had trained}} and who owed much of their success to Wren's {{original}} and leadership were no longer young. Newer generations of architects were beginning to <b>look</b> <b>past</b> Wren's style. The Baroque school his apprentices had created was already under fire from a new generation that brushed Wren's reputation aside and looked back beyond him to Inigo Jones. Architects of the 18th century could not forget Wren, {{but they could not}} forgive some elements in his work they deemed unconventional. The churches left the strongest mark on subsequent architecture. In France, where English architecture rarely made much impression, the influence of St Paul's Cathedral {{can be seen in the}} church of Sainte-Geneviève (now the Panthéon); begun in 1757, it rises to a drum and dome similar to St Paul's, and there are other versions inspired by Wren's dome, from St Isaac's (1840–42) in St Petersburg to the US Capitol at Washington, D.C. (1855–65).|$|E

[...] "Morrowind does have numerous drawbacks .... But they're all generally minor enough that most anyone {{should be able to}} <b>look</b> <b>past</b> them ....

500|$|Many reviewers {{cited the}} game's unusual setting as the {{counterbalance}} to the mediocre gameplay, repetitive environments and poor camera control. Overall, {{the first game}} was moderately well received, with reviewers overlooking gameplay flaws because of a compelling story. Christian Nutt of GameSpy awarded if four stars out of five and commended Bandai for breaking new ground and Cyber Connect 2 for providing an engrossing RPG experience. Gary Steinman of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine wrote, [...] "t its core, [...]hack {{is not a good}} game", calling the battle systems [...] "wildly unbalanced" [...] and the graphics [...] "spectacularly underwhelming", but said the [...] "mind-bending" [...] story allowed him to <b>look</b> <b>past</b> its obvious flaws and anticipate future games in the series.

500|$|Things soon degraded, a legal {{hearing was}} held, and Sullivan {{supported}} Carte by making an affidavit erroneously stating {{that there were}} minor legal expenses outstanding from a battle Gilbert had with Lillian Russell. On 5 May 1890, Gilbert had written to Sullivan: [...] "The time for {{putting an end to}} our collaboration has at last arrived." [...] Gilbert later asked Sullivan to say he had been mistaken in his affidavit, but Sullivan refused. Gilbert felt it was a moral issue, and could not <b>look</b> <b>past</b> it. Sullivan felt that Gilbert was questioning his good faith, and in any event, Sullivan had other reasons to stay in Carte's good graces: Carte was building a new theatre, the Royal English Opera House, to produce Sullivan's only grand opera, Ivanhoe. Gilbert brought suit, and after The Gondoliers closed in 1891, he withdrew the performance rights to his libretti, vowing to write no more operas for the Savoy.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{boasts the}} longest {{title of the}} series and the second-longest of all Star Trek {{television}} installments, behind [...] "For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky" [...] of the 1960s series. [...] "Looking for par'Mach" [...] drew inspiration from the 1897 play Cyrano de Bergerac, in which a brilliant Frenchman, resigned {{to the fact that}} the woman he adores will never be able to <b>look</b> <b>past</b> his distractingly large nose, helps another man win the lady's heart by dictating beautiful language from nearby. The idea for a modern adaption of Cyrano de Bergerac was proposed by Michael Dorn. [...] "Looking for par'Mach" [...] was directed by Andrew Robinson, who plays the Cardassian Elim Garak on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. This marked the first time that the actor of a recurring (but not main) Star Trek character had directed an episode in the franchise. Having just received two Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Awards for theatrical directing, Robinson personally asked executive producer Rick Berman to direct an episode of Deep Space Nine; Robinson was pleased to have been assigned this particular episode.|$|E

These fans realize that the game as a whole is greater than the sum of minor graphical anomalies. [...] On the other hand, I simply can't ignore or forgive the game for crashing on me when I walk around the Mojave Wasteland; or for quests that simply can't be completed because of a game glitch; or for making my companions disappear when I need them the most during a battle.

Although she would be 39 then, {{she did not want to}} give the selectors an opportunity to <b>look</b> <b>past</b> her. The 1994 domestic mountain bike season was the most competitive yet, with Kate Rattray and the visiting Susan DeMattei providing good competition, but it was 1995 where it counted. Rather than go for another veteran's medal, Lynch entered the Pro race at the 1995 UCI Mountain Bike World Championships in Kirchzarten in Germany's Black Forest. Lynch had a fierce start of the cross country race and led the field into the first climb. One by one, younger and full-time professional cylists went past her, and Lynch ended up 21st, with Mary Grigson 33rd, and the other Kiwis further back. They had gained New Zealand two qualifying positions for the Olympics; no New Zealand men qualified. Grigson accepted an offer to race for Australia and left New Zealand (she competed at the Olympics in 1996 and 2000), so the New Zealand Mountain Bike Association decided to nominate just one competitor for the New Zealand Olympic team. The team was announced on 16 April 1996 and Lynch's name came up. This was by no means a foregone conclusion, and Lynch thinks that she was selected against the selection panel's inclinations: ...|$|E
