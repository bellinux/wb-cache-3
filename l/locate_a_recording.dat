The mission of the Archive is to equip {{students}} and scholars with the tools necessary to both engage with and critique news coverage by making actual copies widely available. According to the official history of the archive written by Simpson, he watched a news program where Timothy Leary recommended that young Americans find themselves by freeing their mind and experimenting with LSD. Leary's comment shocked and appalled Simpson. After watching the program, Simpson wanted to watch the program again to confirm what he had heard. It was through his attempts to <b>locate</b> <b>a</b> <b>recording</b> of the news program that he discovered that news programs were not being preserved anywhere for future generations to access. At the time, networks only preserved news program for two weeks— after which tapes were erased and then reused.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to develop and analyze high performance hash based search methods for main memory databasea. We define optimal search in main memory databases as the search that requires at most one key comparison to <b>locate</b> <b>a</b> <b>record.</b> Existing hashing techniques become impractical when they are adapted to yield optimal search in main memory databases be-cause of their large directory size. Multi-directory hash-ing techniques can provide significantly improved direc-tory utilization over single-directory hashing techniques. A multi-directory hashing scheme, called fast search multi-directory hashing, and its generalization, called controlled search multi-directory hashing, are presented. Both methods achieve linearly increasing expected di-rectory size with the number of records. Their perfm-mance is compared to existing alternatives. Index Terms: controlled search, extendible hssh-ing, linear hashing, main memory databases, multi-directory hashing, optimal search, performance analy-sis. ...|$|R
40|$|Trie hashing is a scheme, {{proposed}} by Litwin, for indexing records with very long alphanumeric keys. The records are grouped into buckets of capacity b and maintained on secondary storage. To retrieve <b>a</b> <b>record,</b> the memory resident trie is traversed from the root to a leaf node where {{the address of}} the target bucket is found. Using the address found, the data bucket is read into memory and searched to determine {{the presence or absence of}} the record. The scheme, for all practical purposes, <b>locates</b> <b>a</b> <b>record</b> in one or two disk accesses. Unlike a trie, the scheme proposed suffers from potential degeneracy when the keys inserted are ordered and has an expensive reconstruction cost if a system failure occurs during a session. We present a new approach to implementing Trie Hashing that resolves the degeneracy problem. Our approach combines the basic trie hashing algorithm with the balancing techniques of the Red-Black Binary Search Tree, to produce a relatively balanced trie hashing scheme. As [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Airport Pristina. In the letter, the Cargo Manager {{referred}} to several problems relative to an Invoice for April 2004 {{issued by the}} Cargo Department of Pristina Airport for {{the handling of the}} outgoing mail of a Member State’s KFOR. At the time, Pristina Airport staff could not <b>locate</b> <b>a</b> <b>record</b> of this invoice in the airport’s financial records, and, therefore, the commission of fraud on the part of staff in the Cargo Department was suspected. Background 2. Pristina Airport is the Airline’s cargo handling agent for both imports and exports and the Airline is the Member State’s KFOR’s mail handling agent. Pristina Airport collects mailhandling revenues on behalf of the Airline and deposits these revenues to the airline’s bank account after deducting the appropriate commission. 3. The issues identified in the letter by the Airline Cargo Manager related to the high rate (€ 0. 50 /kg) charged by Pristina Airport for handling outgoing mail; the fact that the Invoice had been incorrectly sent to the Member State’s KFOR instead of their agent, the Airline; and the inappropriate addition of Value Added Tax (VAT), which is not applicable to international traffic...|$|R

It replaced a huge tub file which was part of MOPAR's parts inventory control and order processing system. The 305 was one of the last vacuum tube computers that IBM built. It weighed over a ton. The IBM 350 disk system stored 5 million alphanumeric characters recorded as 6 data bits, 1 parity bit and one space bit for 8 bits recorded per character. It had fifty 24 in disks. Two independent access arms moved up and down to select a disk, and in and out to select <b>a</b> <b>recording</b> track, all under servo control. Average time to <b>locate</b> <b>a</b> single <b>record</b> was 600 milliseconds. Several improved models were added in the 1950s.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{configuration}} for a tethered satellite system, named the &# 039;clustered electrodynamic tether system. &# 039; This configuration consists of multi-electrodynamic tethered satellite systems <b>located</b> in <b>a</b> <b>record</b> disk orbit, {{which is a}} useful orbit for formation flight of multisatellite. The main difference of the clustered electrodynamic tether system from usual constellation flight configurations is that the clustered electrodynamic tether system uses tethers. This new configuration, thus, {{can be interpreted as}} constellation flight both toward out-of-plane direction using <b>a</b> <b>record</b> disk orbit, and in-plane direction using tethers. If librational motion of the clustered electrodynamic tether system is synchronized, the clustered electrodynamic tether system can serve as a platform system to periodically capture launched payloads and to move them to higher altitude, or a system to periodically observe the atmosphere at different altitudes at the same time. To synchronize the librational motion of the clustered electrodynamic tether system, control methods based on the Kuramoto model are proposed. The Kuramoto model is a mathematical model {{that can be used to}} describe synchronized behavior of a large set of coupled oscillators. In this paper, the proposed control methods are validated by numerical simulations...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} the comparison between speech produced in silence and speech in noise, also known as Lombard speech. A temporal filtering algorithm was developed which successfully removes the ambient noise from recordings of Lombard speech by <b>locating</b> and subtracting <b>a</b> <b>recording</b> of the noise performed in the same environment. The filtering algorithm yields overall noise attenuation between 15 and 30 dB without distorting the speech signal like spectral filtering approaches. In the subsequent acoustic analyses we examined the effect of varying levels of noise on vowel formants, glottal spectra and intensity. For most vowels we found significant rises in F 1 and F 2, but little variation in formant bandwidth. The overall rise in intensity between silent and 80 dB babble noise conditions {{was found to be}} of 9 dB. With growing effort higher harmonics are boosted by up to 6 dB whereas the average speech rate only drops by 5 %. In Lombard speech the standard deviation of phone intensity is reduced. 1...|$|R

This incident was witnessed by an 18-year-old woman who made a mental note of the vehicle registration plate. The police were called, who in turn called out the local vehicle registrations officer for Walsall. The woman had mixed up two of the numbers from the registration she had remembered. The police played around with the numbers and <b>located</b> <b>a</b> local <b>record</b> for <b>a</b> green and white Ford Corsair which was registered to Morris.

The police were aware that Morris, who had been interviewed four times in four years, had owned a grey Austin A55 similar to the one used in the abduction of Darby. He had been considered a suspect in Darby's death, but his wife provided him with an alibi by stating that the couple were shopping together the day she went missing. A police search of the Morris flat uncovered pornographic photographs of a young girl who was later determined to be Carol Morris's five-year-old niece. Scotland Yard detectives arrested Raymond Morris for Darby's murder on 16 November 1968. Two charges of indecent assault on the niece and one for the attempted abduction of Aulton would also be filed against Morris.|$|R
