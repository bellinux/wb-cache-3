5000|$|A {{rupture disc}} {{is a type}} of {{sacrificial}} part because it has a one-time-use membrane that fails at a predetermined differential pressure, either positive or vacuum. The membrane is usually made out of metal, but nearly any material (or different materials in layers) can be used to suit a particular application. Rupture discs provide instant response (within milliseconds) to an increase or decrease in system pressure, but once the disc has ruptured it will not reseal. It is not possible to set an accurate pressure value at which the disc will burst.

50|$|Two {{months prior}} to the explosion, the number 5 reactor was {{discovered}} to be leaking. When lagging was stripped from it, a crack extending about 6 ft was visible in the mild steel shell of the reactor. It was decided to install a temporary pipe to bypass the leaking reactor to allow continued operation of the plant while repairs were made. In the absence of 28-inch nominal bore pipe (DN 700 mm), 20-inch nominal bore pipe (DN 500 mm) was used to fabricate the bypass pipe for linking reactor 4 outlet to reactor 6 inlet. The new configuration was tested for <b>leak-tightness</b> at working pressure by pressurisation with nitrogen. For two months after fitting the bypass was operated continuously at temperature and pressure and gave no trouble. At the end of May (by which time the bypass had been lagged) the reactors had to be depressurised and allowed to cool {{in order to deal with}} leaks elsewhere. The leaks having been dealt with, early on 1 June attempts began to bring the plant back up to pressure and temperature.|$|E

It may be utilized to determine the <b>leak-tightness</b> of gasoline cargo tanks during loading without taking the delivery tank out of service, and to determine the <b>leak-tightness</b> of vapor control systems at gasoline terminals and bulk plants at any time. It is applicable for gasoline cargo tanks during loading operations and is effective to determine leak tightness only if the vapor control system does not create backpressure in excess of the pressure limits of the cargo tank certification leak test (18 inches of water gauge). This procedure does not supersede any local APCD procedures regarding gasoline loading operations which are more stringent. 1. 2 Determinations of Compliance and Violation Determinations of certain modes of compliance with and violation of certification specifications are outlined in § 9. 1. 3 Modifications Modification of this procedure may be necessary for vapors and fluids other than the hydrocarbon vapors associated with the dispensing of gasoline...|$|E

Nearly half of their concrete containment buildings are double containments whose leak tightness is primarily dependent on {{the integrity of the}} post-tensioned inner concrete containment building. The post-tensioning is calibrated {{in order to ensure that}} in case of an accident the concrete remains in compression. However, due to creep of concrete, it decreases in time. It is therefore important for EDF to have a detailed knowledge about the behavior of the concretes used in the containment buildings, in order to be able to predict the future evolution of creep, post-tensioning, and <b>leak-tightness</b> of buildings.

40|$|A large-volume {{on-column}} GC-cryotrapping-IR {{system was}} developed for injections of up to 100 μl of organic extracts. Considerable reduction of the solvent-and-water background and enhanced analyte detectability was achieved by using an open-split interface between the GC column and the IR detector and improving the <b>leak-tightness</b> of the system. The system was combined with solid-phase extraction to yield on-line SPE-GC-IR. With this set-up, sample volumes of only 20 ml sufficed to detect, and identify, microcontaminants in tap and surface water at the 0. 1 - 1 μg/L level.

It has been revealed that double-layer cylinders are distinguished by much lower radial strains in the zone of cup-like sealing elements as if compared with one-layer cylinders, as well as equivalent stresses are lower, and safety factor is higher. The data of the study can be recommended to calculate appropriate geometrical parameters of hydraulic props with respect to lower radial strains of a hydraulic cylinder, which improve its <b>leak-tightness</b> and functioning of cup-like sealing elements.

40|$|Looking {{through the}} known and used buoyant systems, {{it can be}} remarked that the single buoyant {{segments}} are the stiff objects made of steel or plastic with variable dimensions and a complex construction. The ready to use buoyant segments, that assure the proper displacement, must have the factory <b>leak-tightness.</b> They take up a big transportation volume and need the assurance of the suitably abundant means of transport. Usually the heavy wheeled vehicles are needed because of high own mass of buoyant segment and large gauges. The exploitation of such constructions is very expensive.

40|$|AbstractIn the {{beginning}} of the year 2013, after the first three years of operation, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) was progressively emptied from helium and warmed up to ambient temperature in order to perform, during its first long shutdown, all necessary consolidation and maintenance of the different technical systems. During the warm-up, six helium leaks were declared on the cryogenic distribution line (QRL). All the leaks were detected on the main header supplying supercritical helium at 4. 5  K during normal LHC operation. Following a complex investigation based on combination of time-of-flight leak detection over 400 -m long vacuum sub-sectors and X-rays, the leaks have been localized on the compensation bellows required for longitudinal thermal contraction. During the investigation, some compensation bellows were found damaged but not leaky yet, amounting to  16 the total number of bellows to be repaired. This paper will present the investigation method for the localization of damaged bellows, the failure mechanism and the applied improvements in the bellows design. The QRL repair procedures and the final <b>leak-tightness</b> validation campaign will be also described...|$|E

A forced sinusoidal pitching motion {{is applied to the}} one-sided clamped helicopter rotor blade tip. Challenges of the structural design and the manufacturing process are addressed.

Insights in the finite element analysis (FEA) of the blade tip model are given. The strength analysis reveals peak stresses in the adhesive and the spar. The finite element model is validated with an experimental modal analysis. The experimental and numerical mode shapes and eigenfrequencies show an excellent agreement. The design goal of a very stiff lightweight model is met with the first eigenfrequency at 70 Hz. The results of the fluid-structure interaction simulation at Ma= 0. 4 show no significant differences for the global forces compared to the simulations with the rigid contour. However, the maximum tip deformation is up to 20 mm and a slight excitation of the first bending mode can be observed...|$|E

40|$|This paper evaluates sealed {{hardware}} {{that meets}} the requirements of DOE-STD- 3013, ''Criteria for Preparing and packaging Plutonium Metals and Oxides for Long-Term Storage'' with respect to radioactive material (Type B quantity) transportation requirements. The Standard provides criteria for packaging of the plutonium materials for storage periods of at least 50 years. The standard requires the hardware to maintain integrity under both normal storage conditions and under anticipated handling conditions. To accomplish this, the standard requires that the plutonium be loaded in {{a minimum of two}} nested stainless steel sealed containers that are both tested for <b>leak-tightness</b> per ANSI N 14. 5. As such the 3013 hardware is robust. While the 3013 STD may provide appropriate storage criteria, it is not intended to provide criteria for transporting the material under the requirements of the Department of Transportation (DOT). In this evaluation, it is assumed that the activity of plutonium exceeds A 1 and/or A 2 curies as defined in DOT 49 CFR 173. 431 and therefore must be shipped as a Type B package meeting the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requirements of 10 CFR 71.

40|$|Currently, all H 1616 {{shipping}} package containers undergo annual re-verification testing, including containment vessel leak testing to verify <b>leak-tightness</b> (< 1 x 10 {sup - 7 } ref cc/sec air) as per ANSI N 14. 5. The {{purpose of this}} literature review is to supplement aging studies currently being performed by SRNL on the EPDM O-rings to provide the technical basis for extending annual re-verification testing for the H 1616 {{shipping package}} and to predict {{the life of the}} seals at bounding service conditions. The available data suggest that the EPDM O-rings can retain significant mechanical properties and sealing force at or below bounding service temperatures (169 F or 76 C) beyond the 1 year maintenance period. Interpretation of available data suggests that a service life of at least 2 years and potentially 4 - 6 years may be possible at bounding temperatures. Seal lifetimes at lower, more realistic temperatures will likely be longer. Being a hydrocarbon elastomer, EPDM O-rings may exhibit an inhibition period due to the presence of antioxidants. Once antioxidants are consumed, mechanical properties and seal performance could decline at a faster rate. Testing is being performed to validate the assumptions outlined in this report and to assess the long-term performance of O-ring seals under actual service conditions...|$|E
40|$|A new plasma fusion experiment, the Wendelstein 7 -X (W 7 -X) {{has been}} built in the Max-Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in Greifswald, Germany. A {{cryostat}} vacuum tank, shaped like a torus, hosts 70 superconducting magnetic coils to produce a toroidal magnetic field that will confine a fusion relevant plasma. The cryostat tank has a volume of about 420 m 3 and is equipped with several hundreds of vacuum ports, feed-throughs and service openings. Nested inside the cryostat is the plasma vessel with a volume of about 80 m 3, also shaped like a torus. This plasma vessel is connected to the outside by 254 ports that traverse the cryostat. These ports are needed as access for plasma diagnostics, plasma heating and the supply of cooling media. We report in this paper on the vacuum leak search on the W 7 -X cryostat, both for the internal piping as well as the integral leak search of the entire vessel against air. This is the initial leak search prior to the first cool-down of W 7 -X. Emphasis is put on the description of the methods, rather than on the results.

The MPC mock-up was constructed of the same materials, welded using the same welding techniques, and has the same diameter and weld sizes as a full-sized MPC. The mock-up was procured for training purposes to demonstrate lid welding and use of ancillary equipment with the vent and drain ports.

40|$|Purpose: The work is {{to present}} and characterise various methods of {{depositing}} carbon nanotubes with nanoparticles of precious metals, and also to present the results of own works concerning carbon nanotubes coated with platinum nanoparticles. Design/methodology/approach: Electron transmission and scanning microscopy {{has been used for}} imaging the structure and morphology of the nanocomposites obtained and the distribution of nanoparticles on the surface of carbon nanotubes. Findings: The studies carried out with the HRTEM and SEM techniques have confirmed differences in morphology, homogeneity and density of depositing platinum nanoparticles on the surface of carbon nanotubes and its structure. Research limitations/implications: The studies conducted pertained to the process of decorating carbon nanotubes with platinum nanoparticles. Further works are planned aimed at extending the application scope of the newly developed methodology to include the methods of nanotubes decorating with the nanoparticles of other precious metals (mainly palladium and rhodium).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} and {{evaluates the}} data and results currently available on the storage of spent AVR fuel elements. Water basin and dry storage facilities {{as well as the}} extensive experimental and development work are taken into consideration. Only slight quantities of krypton 85 and tritium can be released from the fuel element. These isotopes are produced due to the uranium contamination of the graphite matrix resulting from manufacture. The first barrier is the coating of the nuclear fuel particles which retains practically all the fission products. The second barrier required for long-time storage is the welded fuel element can. Unlike existing casks in the FRG made of nodular graphite cast iron, a new AVR cask has been developed which is formed of mild steel R St 37 - 2 and a special heavy concrete. The cask does not have a <b>leak-tightness</b> function but rather only the function of shielding an mechanical protecting the two cans. It possesses the test and quality features of the type B(U) shipping cask pursuant to the IAEA Guidelines. The manufacturing costs are low so that a storage of 15 years involves costs to the amount of 35 DM/fuel element. A comparison of the AVR cask with the spent fuel disposal container for LWR-fuel element shows that it can be used for the direct disposal of spent AVR fuel elements. The cost estimate for spent fuel disposal in the year 2000 results in a value of 25 DM/fuel elements. Costs of 0. 8 - 0. 9 Dpf/kWh are calculated for the complete disposal of AVR fuel elements...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} examine the {{condition}} of intermediate sodiumtosodium heat exchangers (IHX) and to substantiate their operation life extension to 45 years at the BN 600 reactor plant at Beloyarsk NPP Unit 3, {{one of the six}} heat exchangers was removed from the reactor in April 2006. Inspection revealed cracks with 7 maximum depth of mm on the outer surface of the upper tubesheet (UTS) and adjacent shell. To predict durability of substantially fatigued metal, verification of the existing relationship for the threshold stress intensity factor range for the 10 Cr 18 Ni 9 steel was needed. To this end, specimens of two structural elements in the IHX – upper tube sheet and protection block were tested. To identify failure mechanisms, fractographic studies were performed on the surface of cracks detected in the tube sheet and produced in the specimens. The studies led {{to the conclusion that the}} failure mechanism for cracks detected on the tube sheet was identical to the mechanism generated in the test specimens. In both cases the intergranular failure prevailed that is typical for the material stress level indicative of crack growth termination. This result makes it possible to speak about crack initiation and propagation in the IHX tube sheet in the high-cycle fatigue region at low-level strain ranges and stress intensity factor ranges. An analysis of causes of crack formation showed that the cracks could have formed as a result of the temperature pulsation effect produced by mixing of sodium flows having different temperatures – sodium entering the IHX inlet and sodium coming from the reactor vessel cooling system. Computational analysis results showed that for all thermal pulsation conditions and crack propagation cross-sections under consideration, the <b>leak-tightness</b> condition is met for the upper tube-sheet and IHX outlet chamber shell that divide the primary and secondary coolant circuits. The computational and experimental studies have proved that presence of these cracks does not limit the potential service life extension to 45 years for the IHX in the BN 600 reactor plant...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} to monitor the aging performance of Viton{reg_sign} GLT O-rings used in the Model 9975 package has been ongoing for seven years at the Savannah River National Laboratory. Seventy tests using mock-ups of 9975 Primary Containment Vessels (PCVs) were assembled and heated to temperatures ranging from 200 to 450 F. They were leak-tested initially and have been tested periodically {{to determine if they}} meet the criterion of <b>leak-tightness</b> defined in ANSI standard N 14. 5 - 97. Fourteen additional tests were initiated in 2008 with GLT-S O-rings heated to temperatures ranging from 200 to 400 F. High temperature aging continues for 33 GLT O-ring fixtures at 200 - 300 F. Room temperature leak test failures have been experienced in all of the GLT O-ring fixtures aging at 350 F and higher temperatures, and in 7 fixtures aging at 300 F. No failures have yet been observed in GLT O-ring fixtures aging at 200 F for 41 - 60 months, which is still bounding to O-ring temperatures during storage in K-Area Complex (KAC). Based on expectations that the fixtures aging at 200 F will remain leak-tight for a significant period yet to come, 2 additional fixtures began aging within the past year at an intermediate temperature of 270 F, with hopes that they may leak before the 200 F fixtures. High temperature aging continues for 6 GLT-S O-ring fixtures at 200 - 300 F. Room temperature leak test failures have been experienced in all 8 of the GLT-S O-ring fixtures aging at 350 and 400 F. No failures have yet been observed in GLT-S O-ring fixtures aging at 200 - 300 F for up to 26 months. For O-ring fixtures that have failed the room temperature leak test and been disassembled, the Orings displayed a compression set ranging from 51 - 96 %. This is greater than seen to date for packages inspected during KAC field surveillance (24 % average). For GLT O-rings, separate service life estimates have been made based on the O-ring fixture leak test data and based on compression stress relaxation (CSR) data. These two predictive models show reasonable agreement at higher temperatures (350 - 400 F). However, at 300 F, the room temperature leak test failures to date experienced longer aging times than predicted by the CSR-based model. This suggests that extrapolations of the CSR model predictions to temperatures below 300 F will provide a conservative prediction of service life relative to the leak rate criterion. Leak test failure data at lower temperatures are needed to verify this apparent trend. Insufficient failure data exist currently to perform a similar comparison for GLT-S O-rings. Aging and periodic leak testing will continue for the remaining fixtures...|$|E
