5|$|The {{management}} of the construction was flawed from the start: the stem and sternposts, rudder frame, and propeller shaft brackets were not ordered in time, and the late discovery of this omission substantially delayed progress. Verkhovsky, having no time to place orders with reliable foreign suppliers, contracted the job to local plants already known for poor discipline and quality that were already <b>loaded</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> other Navy jobs. The industrial capacity of the Saint Petersburg area could not sustain even the modest rate of naval rearmament {{that the government was}} willing to finance. In April 1893 minor grievances evolved in a full-scale conflict between Verkhovsky and the board of the Alexandrovsky Steel Works, a ridiculous charge of 25 roubles nearly brought the work to a full stop. The savvy admiral always blamed the suppliers but did not even attempt to fix the disarray in his own office.|$|E
25|$|As most {{fishing boats}} were {{purposeful}} heavy working boats built for capacity of haul and stability, and further <b>loaded</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> heavy damp fishing equipment, those who operated as pilots {{needed a new}} type of boat. Early pilot boats were developed from single masted fishing cutter designs and twin masted yawls and latterly into the specialist pilot cutter.|$|E

500|$|Agincourts first assignment, {{together}} with her half-sister , was to tow a floating drydock from England to Madeira {{where it would be}} picked up by [...] and [...] and taken to Bermuda. The ships departed the Nore on 23 June 1869, <b>loaded</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> [...] of coal stowed in bags on their gun decks, and transferred the floating dock 11 days later after an uneventful voyage. Agincourt was assigned to the Channel Squadron upon her return and she became the flagship of the second-in-command of the fleet until she began a refit in 1873.|$|E
500|$|Despite Rockwell's general optimism, he had {{misgivings about}} having {{depicted}} {{such a large}} turkey when much of Europe was [...] "starving, overrun [...] displaced" [...] as World War II raged. Rockwell noted that this painting was not popular in Europe: [...] "The Europeans sort of resented it because it wasn't freedom from want, it was overabundance, the table was so <b>loaded</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> food." [...] Outside the United States, this overabundance was the common perception. However, Richard Halpern says the painting not only displays overabundance of food, but also of [...] "family, conviviality, and security", and opines that [...] "overabundance rather than mere sufficiency is the true answer to want." [...] He parallels the emotional nourishment provided by the image {{to that of the}} food nourishment that it depicts, remarking that the picture is noticeably inviting. However, by depicting the table with nothing but empty plates and white dishes on white linen, Rockwell may have been invoking the Puritan origins of the Thanksgiving holiday.|$|E
500|$|The ship's first posting {{was to the}} Channel Squadron, {{where she}} {{remained}} until 1873. Her first captain, Roderick Dew, had all of her yards painted black {{so that she could}} be visually distinguished from her half-sisters, whose yards were white. During this time she helped her half-sister [...] tow a floating drydock from England to Madeira where it would be picked up by [...] and [...] and taken to Bermuda.

500|$|Reckless's baptism {{under fire}} {{came at a}} place called Hedy's Crotch, near the villages of Changdan and Kwakchan. Though <b>loaded</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> six [...] {{recoilless}} rifle shells, she initially [...] "went straight up" [...] and all four feet left the ground the first time the Recoilless Rifle was fired. When she landed she started shaking, but Coleman, her handler, calmed her down. [...] The second time the gun fired she merely snorted, {{and by the end of}} the mission that day appeared calm and was seen trying to eat a discarded helmet liner. She even appeared to take an interest in the operation of the weapon. When learning a new delivery route, Reckless would only need someone to lead her a few times. Afterwards she would make the trips on her own. There was a standing order not to ride Reckless, but in early December 1952, someone violated that order and took Reckless on a ride that included a sprint through a minefield. She was not injured during the unauthorized ride.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{not easy}} to capture an English or French [...] "Man-of-War" [...] (see [...] "ship of the line"), [...] but pirates would {{sometimes}} come across large ships that could be easily converted for use, slave ships; these were full rigged, three mast giants; a slave ship <b>loaded</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> human cargo and a small crew was easy prey for pirates who wanted to take her or strip everything of value. An example of this is the pirate capture of the Princes Galley, a slaver heading to the Caribbean. The pirates pursued and caught the galley, firing their guns to slow and stop the slave ship; eventually they pulled up alongside and took the gold, gunpowder, weapons, and slaves and sailed off.|$|E
60|$|The {{idea of a}} trip on Bob's yacht suited everybody, and it {{was decided}} that the whole party should go out early Monday morning, taking old Jerry Tolman with them.

2500|$|On November 29, 1898, the City of Ainsworth left Nelson for Bonner's Ferry and {{was caught}} in a gale force storm. <b>Loaded</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> eight cords of wood on her bow, she began to founder. Passengers and crew were quick to throw the {{firewood}} overboard, but then the water rushed down onto her stern and she turned broadside and began to roll in the waves. At one point she rolled over so far that water rushed into her smokestack. The first officer put down one of the two lifeboats, but as soon as five people got in it, it was swamped and four of them were lost in the waves. The second lifeboat was launched with worse results, and another five people were lost.|$|E
2500|$|Adventure Gamers' Cameron Urquhart scored it 4 out of 5. He praised how {{the game}} used factual {{historical}} information in its fictional narrative, {{and was also}} impressed with the graphics, sound and voice acting. He was also complementary of the puzzles; [...] "Rather than being <b>loaded</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> contrived puzzles for padding, Dracula 3 relies heavily on inventory puzzles, yet you are never resigned to trying everything on everything. The hotspots are almost always necessary, while puzzles are logical and accessible and never feel out of place." [...] He concluded [...] "The game rarely wows you in any one way, and the pace can drag at times in dry subject matter, but overall it's both logical and accessible, with [...] interesting approach to vampire lore and deftly crafted storyline." ...|$|E

Nick Southall from Stylus Magazine gave the album a B+, also noting similarities with Aaliyah's single, stating [...] "'Gotta Be You' is disarmingly close to 'Try Again'", further concluding it as [...] "not the best album in the world or even of the year, not obscurantist schizeclecto meta-pop like Annie or M.I.A. or <b>loaded</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> po-mo pop.cult. signifiers like Girls Aloud, it doesn't impart a skewed existential narrative like Britney, but 'Taller In More Ways' is absolutely bursting with tunes, and as such it's hard to resist." ...|$|E

40|$|Historically, American {{politicians}} {{have been far}} more generous to highways than to public transit. The political elite 2 ̆ 7 s failure to support public transit {{is based on the}} view that despite decades of state and federal support, transit ridership has dwindled.

2500|$|Dionysius of Halicarnassus {{claims that}} the {{earliest}} Vestals at Alba Longa were whipped and [...] "put to death" [...] for breaking their vows of celibacy, and that their offspring were to be thrown into the river. According to Livy, Rhea Silvia, the mother of Romulus and Remus, {{had been forced to}} become a Vestal Virgin, and when she gave birth to the twins, it is stated that she was merely <b>loaded</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> chains and cast into prison, her babies put into the river. Dionysius also relates the belief that live burial was instituted by the Roman king Tarquinius Priscus, and inflicted this punishment on the priestess Pinaria. The 11th century Byzantine historian George Kedrenos is the only extant source for the claim that prior to Priscus, the Roman King Numa Pompilius had instituted death by stoning for unchaste Vestal Virgins, and that it was Priscus who changed the punishment into that of live burial. But whipping with rods sometimes preceded the immuration as was done to Urbinia in 471 BC.|$|E

500|$|Morton was a {{formidable}} personality, detested by his enemies, and vilified in opposition newspapers.

Another Republican {{was said to}} have declared, [...] "His presence is a deadly poison" [...] and [...] "He is a sphinx; and I am repressed into dumbness when trying to hold a conversation with that man." [...] According to a southern newspaper that opposed his actions, Morton was [...] "a vice-reeking Hoosier bundle of moral and physical rottenness, leprous ulcers and caustic bandages, who <b>loads</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> plagues and pollutions the wings of every breeze that sweeps across his loathsome putrefying carcass." [...] Other critics and political opponents called him a tyrant and a bully, highlighting his ruthlessness in denouncing, even defaming his enemies, and spreading rumors that he had been a shameless womanizer, forcing himself on every female applicant for favor at the governor's mansion. One Democratic journalist wrote, [...] "There is not, probably, in this country, a more conscienceless, corrupt, and utterly profligate man in public life than Morton" [...] and [...] "He is rotten physically, morally and politically." [...] It was even alleged that his paralysis came from some unspeakable social disease, brought on by his habits. When the Senator declared himself in favor of woman suffrage, the Saint Paul Pioneer was not surprised. [...] "Why shouldn't Morton espouse the woman's cause?" [...] it asked.
