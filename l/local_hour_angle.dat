40|$|We {{summarize}} recent observations by the Composite Infrared Spectrometer of Saturn, its rings, Titan, and the icy satellites. Limb {{observations of}} Saturn show vertical oscillations of temperatures and zonal-wind shears in the equatorial region {{that may be}} related to a temporal oscillation similar to the terrestrial QBO and Jupiter's QQO. There is also evidence of subsidence at mid-northern latitudes driven by the equatorial activity. Nadir-viewing observations show compact warm spots in the troposphere and stratosphere at both (summer and winter) poles, likely associated with subsidence. Observations of Titan have defined better the characteristics of the northern winter polar vortex, with 190 m/s winds surrounding a cold atmosphere at 1 microbar. The very warm polar stratopause at 10 microbar and the enhanced abundances of organic compounds suggest subsidence within the vortex. Analysis of the zonal structure in temperature indicates that the stratospheric zonal winds rotate about an axis that is displaced approximately 4. 1 deg from the IAU pole. Additional flybys, including a close one in March 2008, continue to characterize the endogenic activity in Enceladus s south polar region. Temperature maps of bright and dark terrains on Iapetus indicate that its ice is approximately stable to sublimation in the bright regions and highly unstable in the dark regions. Thermal mapping of Saturn s rings continues to constrain their composition, and observations at different solar phase angles, spacecraft elevations, solar elevations, and <b>local</b> <b>hour</b> <b>angles</b> have elucidated the effects of ring-particle shadowing and vertical motions on the thermal structure, and revealed the presence of small-scale structure associated with self-gravity wakes...|$|R

50|$|To {{calculate}} the azimuth {{of the sun}} or a star given its declination and <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> at our location, we modify the formula for a spherical earth. Replace φ2 with declination and longitude difference with <b>hour</b> <b>angle,</b> and change the sign (since the <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> is positive westward instead of east).|$|R
50|$|Next, the {{altitude}} and azimuth of the celestial body are computed for a selected position (assumed position or AP). This involves resolving a spherical triangle. Given the three magnitudes: <b>local</b> <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> (LHA), observed body's declination (dec), and assumed latitude (lat), {{the altitude}} Hc and azimuth Zn must be computed. The <b>local</b> <b>hour</b> <b>angle,</b> LHA, {{is the difference}} between the AP longitude and the hour angle of the observed object. It is always measured in a westerly direction from the assumed position.|$|E

As you are usually standing on the point Z, you have your Longitude. If the sum comes to more than 360 degrees, simply subtract 360, the answer is simple.|$|E

50|$|Sidereal <b>hour</b> <b>angle,</b> used in {{celestial}} navigation, {{is similar}} to right ascension, but increases westward rather than eastward. Usually measured in degrees (°), it is the complement of right ascension with respect to 24h.It {{is important not to}} confuse sidereal <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> with the astronomical concept of <b>hour</b> <b>angle,</b> which measures angular distance of an object westward from the local meridian.|$|R
50|$|With B the {{latitude}} (+N/S), L the longitude (+E/−W), LHA = GHA + L is the <b>local</b> <b>hour</b> <b>angle,</b> Dec and GHA are the declination and Greenwich hour {{angle of the}} star observed, and Hc the calculated altitude. Z is the calculated azimuth of the body.|$|E

50|$|The cosine of the <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> (cos(h)) {{is used to}} {{calculate}} the solar zenith angle.

50|$|Observing the sun from earth, {{the solar}} <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> is an {{expression}} of time, expressed in angular measurement, usually degrees, from solar noon.

50|$|Using a {{nautical}} almanac, the declination (celestial latitude), and the Greenwich {{hour angle}} (celestial longitude) are obtained {{of the observed}} object for the time of observation.

5000|$|This only calculates a {{longitude}} at {{the assumed}} latitude though a position {{line can be}} drawn. The observer is somewhere along the position line.Time sight is a general method for determining longitude by celestial observations using a chronometer; these observations are reduced by solving the navigational triangle for meridian angle and require known values for altitude, latitude, and declination; the meridian angle is converted to <b>local</b> <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> and compared with Greenwich hour angle.|$|E

50|$|Alternatively {{to right}} ascension, hour angle (abbreviated HA or LHA, <b>local</b> <b>hour</b> <b>angle),</b> a left-handed system, {{measures}} the angular distance {{of an object}} westward along the celestial equator from the observer's meridian to the hour circle passing through the object. Unlike right ascension, hour angle is always increasing with the rotation of Earth. Hour angle may be considered a means of measuring the time since upper culmination, the moment when an object contacts the meridian overhead.|$|E
50|$|In astronomy, {{hour angle}} {{is defined as}} the angular {{distance}} on the celestial sphere measured westward along the celestial equator from the meridian to the hour circle passing through a point. It may be given in degrees, time, or rotations depending on the application.In celestial navigation, the convention is to measure in degrees westward from the prime meridian (Greenwich hour angle, GHA), from the local meridian (<b>local</b> <b>hour</b> <b>angle,</b> LHA) or from the first point of Aries (sidereal hour angle, SHA).|$|E
50|$|To use the compass, {{the base}} plate is first {{levelled}} with the horizon then pointed roughly {{to what the}} user believes to be north. The equatorial drum is then tilted in relation to this base according to the local latitude. The sights are then set using the <b>local</b> <b>hour</b> <b>angle</b> and the declination of whatever astronomical body is being used. Once all these settings have been made, the astrocompass is simply turned until the astronomical body is visible in the sights: it will then be precisely aligned to the points of the compass. Because of this procedure, an astrocompass requires its user to be {{in possession of a}} nautical almanac or similar astronomical tables, one of its chief disadvantages.|$|E

Sight reduction tables provide solutions for navigation triangles of integral degree values. When using precomputed sight reduction tables, such as H.O. 229, the assumed position must be selected to yield integer degree values for LHA (<b>local</b> <b>hour</b> <b>angle)</b> and latitude. West longitudes are subtracted and east longitudes are added to GHA to derive LHA, so AP's must be selected accordingly. When using precomputed sight reduction tables each observation and each body will require a different assumed position.|$|E
5000|$|X is {{the point}} where center of {{celestial}} body lies on celestial sphere: The Sun, The Moon, The Planets, The Stars. Some of these points appear to move relative to the celestial sphere (The Sun, The Moon, The Planets), but the Stars' declination remain's more or less same as they are very far away but their hour angle(GHA or LHA) change constantly, in fact their hour angle changes by 360 degree in every 23 hour 56 minutes and 04.1 second of mean solar time. X is {{described in terms of}} its angular height above or below the equator, known as its Declination (corresponding to its Latitude), and its 'Hour angle', the angle between its meridian and the Greenwich meridian (corresponding to its Longitude). This angle, known as the Greenwich Hour Angle', gives its Longitude. If you are standing on the Greenwich meridian, the angle between your meridian and that of X will be its Greenwich Hour Angle, measured in degrees. However, if you are somewhere else, then the angle between you and the object is known as its <b>Local</b> <b>Hour</b> <b>Angle.</b>|$|E
