[...] They are less complimentary about other elements however, citing the conclusion as feeling [...] "rushed and tacked on" [...] with {{too much emphasis on}} the Guardians and little on the fates of the Eternals.

He then moved {{from his home in}} Fairfax Station, Virginia and purchased a second residence, a condominium in Hamilton County's Anderson Township, east of Cincinnati. McEwen drew upon his connections and quickly had high-profile endorsements from Focus on the Family leader James Dobson, former United States Attorney General Edwin Meese, Cincinnati Bengals player Anthony Muñoz, American Family Association president Donald Wildmon, Citizens for Community Values anti-pornography crusader Phil Burress, and former New York congressman Jack Kemp, who came to the district to campaign for him.

500|$|It {{acquired}} a fresh military significance in 1940 when Pevensey's exposed shoreline and flat hinterland became a possible target {{area for a}} German invasion {{after the fall of}} France. It was reoccupied by the military {{for the first time in}} over 400 years, with British and Canadian troops garrisoning it from May 1940, and Americans later. The towers of the inner bailey were converted into troop accommodation by lining the walls with bricks and laying wooden floors. New perimeter defences were constructed; machine-gun posts were built into the walls, disguised to look <b>like</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the original structure, and an anti-tank blockhouse was built in the entrance of the Roman west gate. The main and postern gates of the inner bailey were blocked by concrete and brick walls, and anti-tank cubes were installed along the areas where the Roman curtain wall had collapsed. The main concern was that an invader could have captured the castle and used its interior as a strongpoint. It was intended that the new defensive measures at the castle would make it [...] "100% tank-proof" [...] and that an enemy would not be able to approach within [...] of it. The United States Army Air Corps also used it as a radio direction centre from early 1944.|$|E
500|$|Lohan {{had planned}} on {{releasing}} an album {{in the summer}} of 2001, according to her official website, llrocks.com. No album was released in 2001, but Lohan had begun recording demo tracks with Emilio Estefan, Jr.. He and his wife, Gloria Estefan, signed Lohan to a five-album production deal in September 2002. [...] "I am extremely excited to be working with Emilio. I am surrounded by a group of very talented people whom have made me feel <b>like</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> their family," [...] Lohan said to the press. Also in September, Lohan landed the role as the daughter in Disney's remake, Freaky Friday, which required her to learn how to play the guitar and to sing. Lohan recorded a song for the film, [...] "Ultimate," [...] which was released to Radio Disney to help promote the film. The song peaked at #18 on Radio Disney's Top 30. Lohan announced that the song was separate from her singing career, since many teen idols such as Hilary Duff and Raven-Symoné were expanding their careers from acting to singing. In 2003, Lohan recorded four songs including a Radio Disney hit, [...] "Drama Queen (That Girl)," [...] that were released for the soundtrack to Lohan's film, Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen.|$|E
500|$|Eurogamer's Aoife Wilson {{found it}} {{difficult}} to pin down why she had enjoyed the movie, as she found it [...] "bloated and badly done," [...] ending up saying that, despite its flaws, it felt <b>like</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the Final Fantasy franchise. She again praised the visuals, but found the dialog to be the movie's weakest point despite the efforts of the lead actors. She summed up Kingsglaive by saying that [...] "as a two-hour piece of promotional material for a game, it works". Scott Clay of RPGFan called watching the movie a necessity for fully understanding the world of Final Fantasy XV, and praised it for its visuals and action scenes, although he noted that there were probably better action movies available. He felt that Kingsglaive managed to get him invested in the story of Final Fantasy XV, saying that [...] " [...] is no masterpiece — in fact, it's nowhere close to one — but it does its job nicely by setting up what could potentially be a very cool story". Polygon's Ashley Oh missed the character development usually seen in the Final Fantasy games although the cast did their best with the script, and while she found the visuals [...] "jaw-droppingly gorgeous" [...] and enjoyed the references to other Final Fantasy titles, she found the story [...] "very weak". She also faulted the lack of strong female characters, something that had been a noted feature in earlier Final Fantasy titles. In contrast to the majority of reviewers, Anthony John Agnello of GamesRadar gave the movie a perfect score of 5/5 stars, calling it [...] "an expert blend of world building, humanity, and the magical strangeness of Final Fantasy" [...] and praising it for balancing its scene setting for Final Fantasy XV with creating a relatable experience, in addition to lauding its visuals and relatable characters. GameSpot's Alexa Ray Corriea was also fairly positive: while she noted {{that it was not a}} coherent movie on its own, she felt that it was a first step by Square Enix to regain fan trust after earlier missteps. She generally enjoyed the story despite a few contrived elements, and gave unanimous praise to the movie's large-scale and more intimate visuals.|$|E

[...] He found the band [...] "capable enough at shifting from tense quiet verses to piledriving, heavy choruses, but they borrow the worst habits from all their favorite groups, and then assemble them in insufferably earnest fashion, playing clichés as if they were revelations." [...] Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone stated, [...] "espite some credible modern-rock tunes, Leto's self-involved myopia guarantees that his band's second disc is long on melodrama." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a review}} from Rickey.org, Nick Roman said, [...] "“The Bear and the Bow” {{is a really}} {{compelling}} episode for Once Upon a Time, and I admit that I wasn’t necessarily expecting it to be. However, the separate trajectories towards heroism and self-confidence for both Merida and Gold were genuinely engrossing... The plot (The deception from Arthur) thickens, and it didn’t feel <b>like</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the same episode {{as the rest of}} the story, considering how singularly focused it is on the Gold/Merida arcs. But it was necessary if next week’s episode is going to kick off the search for this mysterious person. So I can’t really complain about it. All in all, I thought “The Bear and the Bow” delivered, as Once Upon a Time continues what is gradually becoming one of my favorite first-halves of any season in some time." ...|$|E
