Hari reveals to Uma that when he was performing death rituals for Mahadev and offerings were not accepted by crow for a long time, he took a vow that he would not <b>let</b> <b>any</b> other man touch Uma. Thus, he did not allow practised rituals of shaving her head to be performed and also declined Tara's request of their marriage. When he learned through Tara that Uma has started loving him, he stopped talking to her, in spite of his love towards Uma.|$|E

The cultivation of the Greek citron was thereafter on concentrated in Halki, Naxos {{where there is a}} small production for distillery.|$|E

25|$|Tralee saw much {{violence}} {{during the}} Irish War of Independence and Irish Civil War in 1919–1923. In November 1920, the Black and Tans besieged Tralee in revenge for the IRA abduction and killing of two Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) men. The Tans closed all the {{businesses in the}} town and did not <b>let</b> <b>any</b> food in for a week. They burned several houses and all businesses connected with Irish Republican Army (IRA) activists. In {{the course of the}} week, they shot dead three local people. The events caused a major international outcry as the press reported that near-famine conditions were prevailing in Tralee {{by the end of the}} week.|$|E
25|$|In Fall 2008, former ABC Daytime president, Brian Frons began {{hinting that}} more Sam and Jason {{interaction}} would {{occur in the}} future, because the audience wanted {{to see more of}} that. In late 2008, Jason and Sam began to soften to one another again when a man named Joe walked into General Hospital with a bomb strapped to his chest and demanded that his pregnant wife get treatment after previously being turned away. During the lockdown, Elizabeth ran into the hospital with Jake after being in a house fire. Joe initially refused to <b>let</b> <b>any</b> of the doctors help Elizabeth and Jake, but Sam managed to convince Joe to allow Jake treatment. Soon after, Jason arrived at GH, and he and Sam fell back into their old pattern and worked together to stop Joe. Jason and Sam then went their separate ways for a few months, but they both maintained a mutual friend in Spinelli and this sometimes caused them to cross paths.|$|E

25|$|Praise was {{reserved}} for the Indian bowlers' extensively penetrative bowling and their ebullient comeback after a tolling day which saw them becoming increasingly despondent and lacklustre. He bowled half of the sixteen overs possible on that day and his figures were: 8–0–42–3. These figures if expensive, belied the fact that Khan bowled according to the plans the Indians had set to different Australian batsmen. Zaheer hit an unplayable line and length mark right from his very first over and did not <b>let</b> <b>any</b> batsman settle. Agarkar kept Martyn quiet with some deliveries that the batsman played and missed. Greg Chappell and Sunil Gavaskar, two players who had played in the 1981 Melbourne test match between the two countries, when India defeated the Australians by 59 runs after setting them a target of 143, reckoned that the Indian bowlers' performances were quite close to the bowling heroics put up by the Indian team in that match. Overall, Zaheer's 5/95 was his third successive five-wicket haul in tests.|$|E
25|$|In August 1784, Aurora {{went into}} Portsmouth {{to undergo a}} small repair which took until December to complete. She {{returned}} to Portsmouth between July and October 1787 for a refit, being recommissioned under John Sutton in the September. In May 1788, Sutton took Aurora back to the West Indies, setting sail for Jamaica on the third. While there, her carpenter Nicholas Rodgers was court martialled on charges of drunkenness. First Lieutenant Crofton and a midshipman, Thomas Vanderdussen, presented evidence that Rodgers would regularly drink himself into a stupor in his cabin {{or one of the}} ship's boats, and would refuse, whilst drunk, to <b>let</b> <b>any</b> of the crew carry out carpentry tasks in his absence. On 23 July Rodgers had gone ashore at Bluefields and failed to return until arrested by the marines. Later he ascended the quarterdeck to shout abuse at the boatswain. Rodgers denied all charges other than one of abusive language, for which he said he was provoked by others. Rodgers was found guilty on all counts and he was dismissed from naval service.|$|E
25|$|Prior to this film, Parker {{had first}} {{appeared}} decades {{earlier in the}} 1962 novel The Hunter, written by Donald E. Westlake, which spawned into a book series that included over twenty other novels. He had also been depicted in several films including Point Blank (1967) and Payback (1999), among others. Despite these films, Westlake always refused to <b>let</b> <b>any</b> of them use the character's name, saying he'd only allow that if they'd agree to adapt all the novels. In 2008, following Westlake's death, his wife Abby, having been contacted by Les Alexander, a television producer who was a longtime acquaintance of Westlake's, agreed to sell the rights to one Parker novel (including {{the right to use}} Parker's name), with the option of several more being adapted later if the first film was successful. Alexander hired a friend of his named John McLaughlin to write the screenplay for Parker, and then director Taylor Hackford became involved. When the film opened, Taylor Hackford {{said in an interview that}} he didn't think Westlake would have agreed to let Parker's name be used under these circumstances.|$|E

500|$|Phineas {{is portrayed}} as being an {{extremely}} intelligent, lighthearted, naive, confident, warmhearted and redheaded boy. The Disney Channel promos for Phineas and Ferb describe him as someone who [...] "thinks big", refusing to <b>let</b> <b>any</b> day be ordinary. Povenmire also characterizes him as assertive, someone so secure in his abilities that others assume he is a prodigy.

500|$|In Rothbard's view of parenthood, [...] "the parent {{should not}} have a legal {{obligation}} to feed, clothe, or educate his children, since such obligations would entail positive acts coerced upon the parent and depriving the parent of his rights." [...] Thus, Rothbard stated that parents should have {{the legal right to}} <b>let</b> <b>any</b> infant die by starvation, and should be free to engage in other forms of child neglect. However, according to Rothbard, [...] "the purely free society will have a flourishing free market in children". In a fully libertarian society, he wrote, [...] "the existence of a free baby market will bring such 'neglect' down to a minimum".|$|E

Early in the month, a sports recruiter comes to take one athletic girl, Ming Xinhong, to a special training school; unwilling to <b>let</b> <b>any</b> students leave, Wei hides Ming, and when the village mayor (Tian Zhenda) finds her, Wei chases after their car in a futile attempt to stop them.|$|E

2500|$|The deteriorating {{relation}} between contemporary composers {{and the public}} led him to found the Society for Private Musical Performances (Verein für musikalische Privataufführungen in German) in Vienna in 1918. He sought to provide a forum in which modern musical compositions could be carefully prepared and rehearsed, and properly performed under conditions protected from the dictates of fashion and pressures of commerce. From its inception through 1921, when it ended because of economic reasons, the Society presented 353 performances to paid members, sometimes {{at the rate of}} one per week. During the first year and a half, Schoenberg did not <b>let</b> <b>any</b> of his own works be performed [...] Instead, audiences at the Society's concerts heard difficult contemporary compositions by Scriabin, Debussy, Mahler, Webern, Berg, Reger, and other leading figures of early 20th-century music [...]|$|E
