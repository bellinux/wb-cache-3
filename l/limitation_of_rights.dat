2500|$|In 1992, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith {{published}} a statement {{under the title}} [...] "Some Considerations Concerning the Catholic Response to Legislative Proposals on the Non-Discrimination of Homosexual Persons". It commented that some [...] "municipal authorities made public housing, otherwise reserved for families, available to homosexual (and unmarried heterosexual) couples" [...] and said that [...] "such initiatives ... may in fact {{have a negative impact}} on the family and society", affecting [...] "such things as the adoption of children, the employment of teachers, the housing needs of genuine families, landlords' legitimate concerns in screening potential tenants". After recalling what it had already stated in its 1986 letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the pastoral care of homosexual persons, it declared that, because of the moral concern that sexual orientation raises, it is different from qualities such as race, ethnicity, sex or age, and therefore [...] "there are areas where it is not unjust discrimination to take sexual orientation into account, for example, in the placement of children for adoption or foster care, in employment of teachers or athletic coaches, and in military recruitment". <b>Limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> is permissible, and sometimes even obligatory, in cases of [...] "objectively disordered external conduct", even if the conduct is not culpable, as in the case of [...] "contagious or mentally ill persons", the exercise of whose rights can justly, for the sake of the common good, be restricted.|$|E

50|$|One {{consequence}} of the inclusion <b>of</b> a general <b>limitation</b> clause in the Bill <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> is that the process <b>of</b> considering the <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> fundamental <b>rights</b> must be distinguished from that of interpretation <b>of</b> the <b>rights.</b> If {{it is argued that}} conduct or a provision of the law infringes a right in the Bill <b>of</b> <b>Rights,</b> it will first have to be determined whether that right has in fact been infringed, and thereafter whether the infringement is justified. The question of whether an infringement <b>of</b> a <b>right</b> is a legitimate <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> that <b>right</b> “frequently involves a far more factual enquiry than the question of interpretation.” Appropriate evidence must be led to justify the <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>right</b> in accordance with the criteria laid down in section 36. A court cannot determine in the abstract whether the <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>right</b> is “reasonable” or “justifiable in an open and democratic society based on human dignity, equality and freedom.” This determination requires “evidence, such as sociological or statistical data,” on the impact that the legislative restriction has on society.|$|R

In this thesis I discuss various private law <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Right</b> <b>of</b> Ownership arising from its collision with the <b>Right</b> <b>of</b> Ownership of other subjects as well as the public law <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Right</b> <b>of</b> Ownership imposed by the state {{in order to protect the}} public interest. Emphasis is also placed on the protection <b>of</b> the <b>Right</b> <b>of</b> Ownership by means of private legal action and state action. This thesis draws comparisons between the relevant legal regulations of various countries and contains a selection of Czech case law together with the opinions of legal scholars and practicing professionals. The principal finding of this thesis is that from a certain point of view the passage of a new Civil Code seems to be desirable despite the current impossibility to precisely assess its impact on the <b>Right</b> <b>of</b> Ownership...|$|R

[...] However, Binnie made sure to distinguish a previous observation made earlier in Nova Scotia v.

50|$|The {{court found}} that there was no doubt that search and seizure provisions, {{in the context of a}} preparatory investigation, served an {{important}} purpose in the fight against crime. That the State had a pressing interest which involved the security and freedom of the community as a whole was beyond question. It was an objective which was sufficiently important to justify the limitation of the right to privacy of an individual in certain circumstances. The right was not meant to shield criminal activity or to conceal evidence of crime from the criminal justice process. On the other hand, State officials were not entitled without good cause to invade the premises of persons for purposes of searching and seizing property; there would otherwise be little content left to the right to privacy. A balance therefore had to be struck between the interests of the individual and that of the State, a task that lay at the heart of the inquiry into the <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|E

40|$|Proportionality" is a {{contemporary}} heavy-weight concept {{which has been}} described as an element of a globalised international grammar and as a foundational element of global constitutionalism. The article firstly describes the elements of proportionality as they are generally understood in foreign systems, namely whether the limitation pursues a legitimate aim, whether the limitation is capable of achieving this aim, whether the act impairs the right as little as possible and the so-called balancing stage when it must be determined whether the achievement of the aim outweighs the limitation imposed. The German academic Alexy (Theorie der Grundrechte (1986)) developed what he called a mathematical weight formula to deal with the balancing stage. An overview is provided of how the elements of proportionality were dealt with in the text of the South African interim Constitution of 1994, the early jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court, and in the text of the final Constitution of 1996. Contemporary South African academic criticism of the use of the concept is also analysed. The article then endeavours to relate the elements of Alexy’s weight formula to both the elements of the South African general limitation clause in section 36 of the Constitution and to the appearance of such elements in the formulation of specific rights in the Bill of Rights. Although the levels of abstraction reached in the debates on the Alexy formula are so daunting that it is most unlikely that South African courts and practitioners will ever use it, certain valuable insights can be gained from it for the purposes of dealing with proportionality {{within the context of the}} <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> in South Africa. Despite opposition from certain academics, proportionality is a prominent feature of the application of the limitation clauses in the South African Constitution. The elements of proportionality provides a useful tool for the application, within the context of the <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights,</b> of general and wide concepts such as "fairness", "reasonableness", "rationality", "public interest" and, somewhat surprisingly, also of the general concept "proportionality" as such. South Africa’s participation in the global recognition and application of this way of dealing with the <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> is worthwhile...|$|E
