40|$|Innovation {{diffusion}} {{models are}} used in business statistics and quantitative marketing to describe and forecast the growth dynamics of new products and technologies when <b>launched</b> <b>into</b> <b>markets.</b> Such models are useful, as they {{shed light on the}} mechanisms that generate and enhance the penetration of an innovation into a social system. The most famous diffusion model is that by Bass (1969), which forms the basis of several extensions of it. One of these, the Guseo-Guidolin model (2009), assumes a dynamic market potential, which is generated by a communication process among consumers. This model has proven a useful improvement of the Bass model in different industrial applications (e. g., pharmaceutical, ICTs). We propose new applications of the Guseo-Guidolin model in three industrial sectors, where timely analyses and forecasts on consumption dynamics are of strategic importance for business and policy choices: energy, entertainment, pharmaceutical. In particular, we show the forecasting improvement obtained with respect to the simpler Bass model and give a precise interpretation of the parameters involved in all applications...|$|R

40|$|Depth-Image-Based Rendering (DIBR) is {{a mature}} and {{important}} method for making free-viewpoint videos. As {{for the study}} of the DIBR approach, on the one hand, most of current research focuses on how to use it in systems with low resolution cameras, while a lot of Ultra HD rendering devices have been <b>launched</b> <b>into</b> <b>markets.</b> On the other hand, the quality and accuracy of the depth image directly affects the final rendering result. Therefore, in this paper we try to make some improvements on solving the problem of recovering the depth information for Ultra HD cameras with the help of a Kinect V 2 sensor. To this end, a linear least squares method is proposed, which recovers the rigid transformation between a Kinect V 2 and an Ultra HD camera, using the depth information from the Kinect V 2 sensor. In addition, a non-linear coarse-to-fine method, which is based on Sparse Bundle Adjustment (SBA), is compared with this linear method. Experiments show that our proposed method performs better than the non-linear method for the Ultra HD depth image recovery both in computing time and precision...|$|R

The ideal dentin disinfectant should combine the possession of a potent antimicrobial action and should not interfere with the bonding of the subsequently applied adhesive system. Furthermore, it should enhance the durability of the bond through the inhibition of the matrix derived enzyme (matrix-metalloprotease). [5...|$|R
