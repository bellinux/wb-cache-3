5|$|Around daybreak, Pike's A Company, 2/17th Infantry Battalion, {{reached the}} village of Katika, {{which turned out to}} be a {{clearing}} with some dilapidated huts. His company came under fire from Katika Spur, the high ground to the west, which was strongly held by the 9th Company, 80th Infantry Regiment and a company of the 238th Infantry Regiment. The Japanese attempted to outflank A Company on its <b>left,</b> <b>but</b> ran into Capitan L. Snell's D Company, 2/15th Infantry Battalion.|$|E
5|$|Dawson City {{was founded}} in 1896 {{in the early days}} of the Klondike Gold Rush, {{alongside}} the Yukon River in north-western Canada. Swelled by would-be gold-miners and adventurers, Dawson's population soared to 30,000 at the height of the rush in 1898. Dawson declined in size again as many of the immigrants <b>left,</b> <b>but</b> it was appointed the Territorial Capital of the new Yukon Territory in 1900, and by the following year it had a stable population of around 10,000.|$|E
5|$|After the red-giant branch the Sun has {{approximately}} 120 {{million years}} of active life <b>left,</b> <b>but</b> much happens. First, the core, full of degenerate helium ignites violently in the helium flash, {{where it is}} estimated that 6% of the core, itself 40% of the Sun's mass, will be converted into carbon within a matter of minutes through the triple-alpha process. The Sun then shrinks to around 10 times its current size and 50 times the luminosity, with a temperature a little lower than today. It will then have reached the red clump or horizontal branch, but a star of the Sun's mass does not evolve blueward along the horizontal branch. Instead, it just becomes moderately larger and more luminous over about 100 million years as it continues to burn helium in the core.|$|E

Each time he does so, the pot takes on the {{symptoms}} of the ones who ask for help, it starts disturbing the son and prevents him from having any peace of mind. This continues until the son finally gives up and provides aid to the town. Upon doing this, the pot's ailments are removed {{one by one and}} the son's ordeal finally ends one day when the slipper he received from his father falls out of the pot; he puts the slipper on the pot's foot and the two walk off into the sunset.|$|E
5|$|Chance leads Natasha to {{his uncle}} Douvee's (Wilford Brimley) house {{deep in the}} bayou, and enlists his help in {{defeating}} the men. Chance, Natasha, and Douvee lead the hunting party to a warehouse of old damaged Mardi Gras floats and statues, called Mardi Gras graveyard, and even kill off Fouchon's men one by one. Van Cleef is finally gunned down by Chance in a shootout. In the end only Fouchon is <b>left,</b> <b>but</b> he holds Chance at bay by taking Natasha hostage and stabbing Douvee in the chest with an arrow. Chance charges him, attacking with a flurry of blows, and then drops a grenade in his pants. Fouchon attempts to dismantle the grenade, but fails and gets incenerated in the explosion. Chance, Natasha, and Douvee now make {{their way out of}} the warehouse.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, Oklahoma {{promoted}} Bud Wilkinson, then {{an assistant}} coach, to head coach. Wilkinson led the Sooners to national championships in 1950, 1955, and 1956, {{as well as}} a stretch of 47 consecutive victories that began in 1953 and ended in 1957. Wilkinson's tenure included a streak of 13consecutive conference championships (in addition to one by his predecessor). Oklahoma continued to perform well after Wilkinson <b>left,</b> <b>but</b> only returned to the national title picture following the hiring of Barry Switzer in 1973. Switzer began similarly to Wilkinson, with eight consecutive conference championships in addition to national championships in 1974 and 1975. Switzer added Oklahoma's sixth national championship in 1985.|$|E

On the March 14 episode of Raw, one of Maria's fillings legitimately fell out after she was slapped by Trish Stratus. She also competed in a Fulfill Your Fantasy Diva Battle Royal at Taboo Tuesday for the WWE Women's Championship, but {{was the first to}} be eliminated.

5|$|Justinian's Chalke was a {{rectangular}} building, with four engaged piers supporting a central dome on pendentives, {{which in turn}} rested on four barrel arches in the typical Byzantine fashion. The piers {{to the south and}} north were somewhat lower than those to the east and west. The central structure was adjoined by two smaller chambers on either side to the south and north, each again featuring a vaulted roof. The relation of the Church of Christ Chalkites with the gate is unclear; Cyril Mango suggested that it was located to its <b>left,</b> <b>but</b> it has also been proposed that it was actually built atop the gatehouse itself. It is known that the chapel was placed atop an elevated platform, and 18th-century depictions locate it some 100 m southeast of the Hagia Sophia.|$|E
5|$|Khalif Wyatt, who {{replaced}} Juan Fernandez after Fernandez had continuing knee problems, was key in Temple Owls' 76–67 win over Charlotte. He scored 17 points, collected six dimes, and grabbed six rebounds. Ramone Moore added 16 points, Lavoy Allen recorded a double-double (15 points and 11 rebounds), and Scootie Randall contributed 14 points. On January 29, Temple Owls defeated city rival Saint Joseph's 72–54. Scootie Randall led Temple with 17 points. In their next game, Temple Owls won against La Salle by 71–67. The Owls had a 61–47 lead with 3:17 <b>left,</b> <b>but</b> Aaric Murray led a late Explorers comeback as he connected on two three-point shots. Khalif Wyatt scored 18 {{points for the}} Owls.|$|E

His weapon failed to fire so he entered the emergency staircase where he was seen reloading his gun. He returned to the room he had just <b>left,</b> <b>but</b> the students had locked the door; Lépine failed to unlock it with three shots fired into the door. Moving along the corridor he shot at others, wounding one, before moving towards the financial services office where he shot and killed a woman {{through the window of}} the door she had just locked.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{scientists}} at Los Alamos were eager {{to return to their}} laboratories and universities, and by February 1946 all of the wartime division heads had <b>left,</b> <b>but</b> a talented core remained. Darol Froman became head of Robert Bacher's G division, now renamed M Division. Eric Jette became responsible for Chemistry and Metallurgy, John H. Manley for Physics, George Placzek for Theory, Max Roy for Explosives, and Roger Wagner for Ordnance. The number of personnel at Los Alamos plummeted from its wartime peak of over 3,000 to around 1,000, but many were still living in temporary wartime accommodation. To make matters worse, the water pipe to Los Alamos froze and the water had to be supplied by tanker trucks. Despite the reduced staff, Bradbury still had to provide support for Operation Crossroads, the nuclear tests in the Pacific.|$|E

It moved to Sandia Base between March and July 1946, except for its Z-4 (Mechanical Engineering) Group, which followed in February 1947.|$|E

5|$|Opeth {{was formed}} in 1990 by vocalist David Isberg. He later {{recruited}} bassist Mikael Åkerfeldt {{without the consent of}} the other band members he previously hired, which resulted in the departure of all members except Isberg and Åkerfeldt. Isberg soon <b>left,</b> <b>but</b> Åkerfeldt decided to remain in the band and keep it in activity. For this he contacted guitarist Peter Lindgren, bassist Johan De Farfalla, and drummer Anders Nordin. With this lineup, they recorded a demo, which led to the band’s first record label contract. Candlelight Records signed the band. In 1995, Opeth released their first studio album, Orchid, and after more changes to the lineup, the band released Morningrise and My Arms, Your Hearse in 1996 and 1997 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Some {{cylinder}} valve models have axial spindles - {{in line with}} the cylinder axis, and are not handed. Standard side-spindle valves have the valve knob on the diver's right side when back-mounted. Side-spindle valves used with manifolds must be a handed pair - one with the knob to the right and the other with the knob to the <b>left,</b> <b>but</b> in all cases the valve is opened by turning the knob anticlockwise, and closed by turning it clockwise. This is the convention with almost all valves for all purposes. Left hand side-spindle valves are used by sidemount divers.|$|E
5|$|The El Badi Palace flanks {{the eastern}} side of the Kasbah. It was built by Saadian sultan Ahmad al-Mansur after his success against the Portuguese at the Battle of the Three Kings in 1578. The lavish palace, which took around a quarter of a century to build, was funded by {{compensation}} from the Portuguese and African gold and sugar cane revenue. This allowed Carrara marble to be brought from Italy and other materials to be shipped from France, Spain and India. It is a larger version of the Alhambra's Court of the Lions. Although the palace is now a ruin with little <b>left</b> <b>but</b> the outer walls, the site has become the location of the annual Marrakech Folklore Festival and other events.|$|E

5|$|The Falcons {{controlled}} {{the ball for}} 41 of 60 minutes. An inability to complete long passes, combined with fumbles, prevented the Buccaneers from taking {{what could have been}} a large early lead. Isaac Hagins' fumble to Atlanta's Tom Pridemore set up a 31-yard field goal. The Buccaneers maintained a halftime lead, despite having held the ball for only six minutes and 18 seconds in the first half. Falcon blitzing disrupted Doug Williams' passing, and Ricky Bell and Jerry Eckwood were held to 72 yards rushing. Eckwood's fumble led to Atlanta's go-ahead touchdown with 11:10 remaining. Bubba Bean's 60-yard run with 1:22 remaining clinched the game for the Falcons. A 69-yard Williams-led drive brought the Buccaneers to within three points with 28 seconds <b>left,</b> <b>but</b> the Buccaneers failed to recover the ensuing onside kick.|$|E

5|$|The {{score was}} still tied at one apiece {{in the bottom}} of the sixth, just as rain began to fall. Ruth lined a single past third baseman Les Bell. Meusel again sacrificed Ruth to second.

Lazzeri advanced to second on the throw. Bell bobbled Dugan's grounder for an error to put runners at first and third, but Hank Severeid forced Dugan at second to end the inning.
