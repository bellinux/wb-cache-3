500|$|Skinner {{returns to}} the routing center where he tears {{a hole in the}} {{bathroom}} wall and finds a large honeycomb of dead bees. He visits an entomologist to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bees and is told that Mulder visited him six months ago about a similar subject. Skinner finds Mulder's file on the matter, copying down the contact information for Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden). Mulder tells Skinner that a bank near the police station took a picture of the detective, which shows him with Skinner, but the picture is too obscured for Mulder to identify him. Skinner calls Covarrubias, who does not have any evidence to provide him at this time. The entomologist is killed by a swarm of bees. The next day, Mulder and Skinner look at his body, which is infected with smallpox transmitted by the bees. Skinner visits the co-worker of the postal worker who died, who tells him she was pressured to not say anything about what happened by men who demanded a damaged package. At the photo lab Mulder analyzes the photo, which reveals Skinner's identity.|$|E

60|$|She {{said this}} in a great many {{different}} ways, {{and then she was}} really silent. He perceived that she was hurt; and he tried to win her back to good-humor. He asked her if she would not like to go over to Hoboken and <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hanseatic League steamers, some day; and she refused. When he sent the next day and got a permit to see the boat; she consented to go.|$|E
6000|$|Such {{measure of}} {{response}} {{as he had}} good-naturedly given her was the mere frayed edge of a mastering detachment, the copious, impatient range elsewhere of his true attention. Somehow, however, he still seemed kind even while, turning his back upon her, he moved off to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> several, the famous Dedborough pictures--stray specimens, by every presumption, lost {{a little in the}} whole bright bigness.

6000|$|Take, for instance, {{any of the}} {{definitions}} laid down as premises in Euclid’s Elements; the definition, let us say, of a circle. This, being analyzed, consists of two propositions; the one an assumption {{with respect to a}} matter of fact, the other a genuine definition. “A figure may exist, having all the points in the line which bounds it equally distant from a single point within it:” “Any figure possessing this property is called a circle.” Let us <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> demonstrations which are said to depend on this definition, and observe to which of the two propositions contained in it the demonstration really appeals. “About the centre A, describe the circle B C D.” ...|$|E

6000|$|It was now our {{object to}} steer a course over the wide plain around us, leading {{directly}} to the [...] "Cheese-Wring" [...] rocks (so called from their supposed resemblance to a Cornish cheese-press or [...] "wring"). On our road to this curiosity, about {{a mile and a}} half from St. Clare's Well, we stopped to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most perfect and remarkable of the ancient British monuments in Cornwall. It is called Trevethey Stone, and consists of six large upright slabs of granite, overlaid by a seventh, which covers them in the form of a rude, slanting roof. These slabs are so irregular in form as to look quite unhewn. They all vary in size and thickness. The whole structure rises to a height, probably, of fourteen feet; and, standing as it does on elevated ground, in a barren country, with no stones of a similar kind erected near it, presents an appearance of rugged grandeur and aboriginal simplicity, which renders it an impressive, almost a startling object to look on. Antiquaries have discovered that its name signifies The Place of Graves; and have discovered no more. No inscription appears on it; the date of its erection is lost in the darkest of the dark periods of English history.|$|E
60|$|He now came every day; {{he was so}} old {{a friend}} that the {{formality}} of extracting the thorn was no longer observed; it would have contributed nothing to the good understanding that existed {{between him and the}} widow. He thought that three or four instances of Good Samaritanism afforded ample matter for perpetual gratitude. His constant visits were bad for the live stock of the farm; for some kind of beast had to be in readiness each day to furnish forth the usual feast, and this prevented multiplication. Most of the textile fabrics, too, had disappeared; for the appetite of this animal was at the same time cosmopolitan and exacting: it would accept almost anything in the way of entremets, but something it would have. A hearthrug, a hall-mat, a cushion, mattress, blanket, shawl, or other article of wearing apparel--anything, in short, that was easy of ingestion was graciously approved. The widow tried him once with a box of coals as dessert to some barn-yard fowls; but this he seemed to regard as a doubtful comestible, seductive to the palate, but obstinate in the stomach. A <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> children always brought him something else, no matter what he was then engaged on.|$|E
60|$|In {{this way}} the large and {{influential}} feminine majority of the family at the brewery was brought round to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> propositions made by Rowan without disfavour. It was not that that young man's sins had been in any degree forgiven, but that they all perceived, with female prudence, {{that it would be}} injudicious to ruin themselves because they hated him. And then to what lady living in a dingy brick house, close adjoining to the smoke and smells of beer-brewing, would not the idea of a marine villa at Torquay be delicious? None of the family, not even Mrs. Tappitt herself, had ever known what annual profit had accrued to Mr. T. as the reward of his life's work. But they had been required to live in a modest, homely way,--as though that annual profit had not been great. Under the altered circumstances, as now proposed, they would all know that papa had a thousand a year to spend;--and what might not be done at Torquay with a thousand a year? Before Mr. Tappitt came home for the evening,--which he did not do on that day till past ten, having been detained, by business, in the bar of the Dragon Inn,--they had all resolved that the combined ease and dignity of a thousand a year should be accepted.|$|E

60|$|I never <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{them without}} feeling that {{gravitation}} of soul towards its artist which poetry always excites. Often {{the artist is}} unknown; here we know him; Erwin von Steinbach, poet, prophet, priest, in architecture.|$|R
60|$|It {{has often}} been vaguely {{asserted}} that plants are distinguished from animals by not having the power of movement. It should rather be said that plants acquire and display this power only when it is of some advantage to them; this being of comparatively rare occurrence, as they are affixed to the ground, and food is brought {{to them by the}} air and rain. We see how high in the scale of organization a plant may rise, when we <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more perfect tendril-bearers. It first places its tendrils ready for action, as a polypus places its tentacula. If the tendril be displaced, it is acted on by the force of gravity and rights it self. It is acted on by the light, and bends towards or from it, or disregards it, whichever may be most advantageous. During several days the tendrils or internodes, or both, spontaneously revolve with a steady motion. The tendril strikes some object, and quickly curls round and firmly grasps it. In the course of some hours it contracts into a spire, dragging up the stem, and forming an excellent spring. All movements now cease. By growth the tissues soon become wonderfully strong and durable. The tendril has done its work, and has done it in an admirable manner.|$|E
6000|$|Nor {{has he been}} {{content with}} merely blowing the trumpet for the battle of well-doing; he has given to his precepts the {{authority}} of his own brave example. Naturally a grave, believing man, {{with little or no}} sense of humour, he has succeeded as well in life as in his printed performances. The spirit that was in him has come forth most eloquently in his actions. Many who have only read his poetry have been tempted to set him down as an ass, or even as a charlatan; but I never met any one who had known him personally who did not profess a solid affection and respect for the man's character. He practises as he professes; he feels deeply that Christian love for all men, that toleration, that cheerful delight in serving others, which he often celebrates in literature with a doubtful measure of success. And perhaps, out of all his writings, the best and the most human and convincing passages {{are to be found in}} [...] "these soil'd and creas'd little livraisons, each composed of a sheet or two of paper, folded small to carry in the pocket, and fastened with a pin," [...] which he scribbled during the war by the bedsides of the wounded or in the excitement of great events. They are hardly literature in the formal meaning of the word; he has left his jottings for the most part as he made them; a homely detail, a word from the lips of a dying soldier, a business memorandum, the copy of a letter-short, straightforward to the point, with none of the trappings of composition; but they breathe a profound sentiment, they give us a vivid <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sides of life, and they make us acquainted with a man whom it is an honour to love.|$|E
60|$|At last, {{after much}} hard and steady climbing, {{we reached the}} top and stood upon a {{perfectly}} level space ten or twelve acres in extent, exactly in the centre of which was placed the chief's kraal. Before we dismounted we rode to the extreme {{western edge of the}} plateau, to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most perfectly lovely views it is possible to imagine. It was like coming face to face with great primeval Nature, not Nature as we civilised people know her, smiling in corn-fields, waving in well-ordered woods, but Nature as she was on the morrow of the Creation. There, to our left, cold and grey and grand, rose the great peak, flinging its dark shadow far beyond its base. Two thousand feet and more beneath us lay the valley of the Mooi river, with the broad tranquil stream flashing silver through its midst. Over against us rose another range of towering hills, with sudden openings in their blue depths through which could be seen the splendid distances of a champaign country. Immediately at our feet, and seeming to girdle the great gaunt peak, lay a deep valley, through which the Little Bushman's River forced its shining way. All around rose the great bush-clad hills, so green, so bright in the glorious streaming sunlight, and yet so awfully devoid of life, so solemnly silent. It was indeed a sight never to be forgotten, this wide panoramic out-look, with its towering hills, its smiling valleys, its flashing streams, its all-pervading sunlight, and its deep sad silence. But it was not always so lifeless and so still. Some few years ago those hills, those plains, those rivers were teeming each with their various creatures. But a short time since, and standing here at eventide, the traveller could have seen herds of elephants cooling themselves yonder after their day's travel, whilst the black-headed white-tusked sea-cow rose and plunged in the pool below. That bush-clad hill was the favourite haunt of droves of buffaloes and elands, and on that plain swarmed thousands upon thousands of springbok and of quagga, of hartebeest and of oribi. All alien life must cease before the white man, and so these wild denizens of forest, stream, and plain have passed away never to return.|$|E
