Con Thien was the battle before Tet, a battle commanders at the time dismissed, and later forgotten maybe a <b>little</b> <b>embarrassed</b> because it showed how unprepared the US was for the 1968 Tet offensive.|$|E
500|$|When it {{came time}} to write the episode however, Kaling had to perform a Google search, as she had {{forgotten}} many details. She explained, [...] "I was a <b>little</b> <b>embarrassed</b> with how little I knew about it. I'm Hindu, but I'm not really a practicing Hindu, so I had {{to do a lot of}} research." [...] Kaling was pleased to learn more about her culture, at first being concerned that Daniels [...] "and people I work with were a little antsy about assigning the Hindu writer the Indian episode. I didn't want to feel like they pigeonholed me, but I felt like I'd done enough episodes that it was okay." [...] She found that making the episode [...] "was kind of the perfect meeting of being the child of immigrants and writing for a comedy show." [...] The series writers have since joked that they should do a Diwali-themed episode every year in the same vein as the Christmas specials.|$|E
500|$|As well {{as being}} tragic, Dot is scripted as a comic character. Brown has {{discussed}} the humour she incorporates into her performances: [...] "I think Dot would be awfully boring if she weren't a bit comic [...] I always thought I had to put an edge on it, an edge of comedy, which just means doing it more seriously than you would do. If {{you want to play}} comedy then {{you have to be very}} intense about it [...] very, very serious." [...] Some of Dot's catchphrases are used for humour, such as [...] "Ooh I say!", uttered when she is [...] "stuck for words". In 2004, Brown discussed the origin of the saying: [...] "It was written once in the script and I quite enjoyed it, so I used to say it occasionally when it wasn't in the scripts. It was useful because it could be said in all different ways. Dot's very straight-laced, so it helped to express her horror at what went on." [...] Brown revealed in 2008 that she has tried to cut down the use of this, along with the mispronunciation of her employer, Mr Papadopolous, as she has become a <b>little</b> <b>embarrassed</b> by them now they are so known. Mr. Papadopolous is the owner of the launderette where Dot works. In a long-running joke, Dot has difficulty pronouncing his surname, and for much of the show's history he has been referred to as Mr. Oppodopolus, Oppydoppy, or varying other mispronunciations. Brown has said she enjoys playing the comical aspects of Dot, stating, [...] "She's not dreadfully funny but she's amusing and I like that because it lightens it up a bit." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Grant starred {{opposite}} Drew Barrymore in {{a parody}} of pop culture and the music industry called Music and Lyrics. The Associated Press described it as [...] "a weird little hybrid of a romantic comedy that's simultaneously too fluffy and not whimsical enough." [...] Though he neither listens to music nor owns any CDs, Grant learned to sing, play the piano, dance (a few mannered steps) and studied the mannerisms of prominent musicians to prepare {{for his role as}} a has-been pop singer, based loosely on Andrew Ridgeley, the lesser-known member of 1980s pop duo Wham!. The Star-Ledger dismissed the performance, writing that [...] "paper dolls have more depth." [...] The film, with its revenues totalling $145million, allowed Grant to mock disposable pop stardom and fleeting celebrity through its washed-up lead character. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, [...] "Grant strikes precisely the right note with regard to Alex's career: He's too intelligent not to be a <b>little</b> <b>embarrassed,</b> but he's far too brazen to feel anything like shame." [...] In 2009, Grant starred opposite Sarah Jessica Parker in the Marc Lawrence's romantic comedy Did You Hear About the Morgans?, which was a critical failure but was a box office success. He reunited with Lawrence again for a dramedy film The Rewrite, starring opposite Marisa Tomei. The film received mixed-to-positive reviews, while Grant's performance was praised by many critics. Director Quentin Tarantino has stated that the film is one of his favorites of the year and called Grant a [...] "perfect leading man." [...] In 2015, he had a supporting role as Alexander Waverly in Guy Ritchie's The Man from U.N.C.L.E. Entertainment Weekly described his performance as [...] "the only bit of fun" [...] in the film. Glenn Kenny of Rogerebert.com gave film a mixed review but stated that [...] "while it can’t be said that Hugh Grant saves the movie, his return to prominence in the last half-hour, after a plot-seeding-walk-on earlier in the movie, peps things up considerably." ...|$|E

[...] which was {{a reference to the}} alleged involvement of Hawke in the resignation of former Labor leader, Bill Hayden. The question outraged Hawke, who criticised Carleton for his [...] "damned impertinence".|$|E
2500|$|By {{shooting}} down five bombers O'Hare became a flying ace, {{was selected for}} promotion to lieutenant commander, {{and became the first}} naval aviator to receive the Medal of Honor. With President Franklin D. Roosevelt looking on, O'Hare's wife Rita placed the Medal around his neck. After receiving the Medal of Honor from President Franklin D. Roosevelt, then-LT O'Hare was described as [...] "modest, inarticulate, humorous, terribly nice and more than a <b>little</b> <b>embarrassed</b> by the whole thing".|$|E
