50|$|Scott Dixon led Dan Wheldon as {{the race}} passed the 160 <b>lap</b> <b>mark</b> (40 laps to go). With fuel running low, both cars gambled on the rain resuming.

50|$|At the 90 <b>lap</b> <b>mark,</b> Al Unser, Sr. {{had worked}} up to 4th, and Tom Sneva 5th. Andretti was still dominating, running laps {{in the low}} 200's mph range, while most other cars were in the 190 mi/h km/h range, or slower. Dick Simon was running 7th, but ran the car out of fuel on the backstretch. He lost several laps as he was towed back to the pits, but {{received}} fuel, {{and returned to the}} track.|$|E

50|$|The Austrian GP on 17 August had a {{very large}} attendance, as Lauda had a chance of getting close to the {{championship}} at his home race. Lauda did not disappoint them, as he took pole position, with Hunt second and Fittipaldi third. His chief rival, Reutemann, was only 11th. On a morning practice <b>lap,</b> <b>Mark</b> Donohue's March slid off the track after a tyre failure and hit two marshals. Donohue died two days later, {{and one of the}} marshals also died.|$|E
50|$|NASCAR {{continued}} to dry {{the track and}} scheduled a night restart at 9 PM PST. That time was postponed twice by an hour to 11 PM local time, when they felt that track drying was inadequate. Ultimately {{at the time the}} race was to have restarted, NASCAR officials suspended activities for the evening. When action resumed on Monday morning, Jimmie Johnson led the race when on Lap 132, Jeff Burton brushed the wall on Turn 3 to force the eighth caution period. Three more cautions would follow, ultimately letting Carl Edwards win the race under caution when Dale Jarrett spun in Turn 3 on the last <b>lap.</b> <b>Mark</b> Martin made his 800th career Winston/NEXTEL/Sprint Cup start in this race.|$|E
50|$|On the warm-up <b>lap,</b> <b>Mark</b> Martin's {{steering}} box locked, {{causing him to}} crash into pole-sitter Jimmie Johnson. As {{a result of the}} incident, Martin was black-flagged, while Johnson's crew chief Chad Knaus requested NASCAR to inspect the car and repair the damaged right front fender. Johnson later came into the garage on lap one. Jeff Gordon led the first three laps, but on lap 125, he was forced to move the car to the garage after his crew found smoke under the hood, ending his race. Gordon was not the only Hendrick Motorsports to fail to finish; the other Hendrick drivers, Johnson, Terry Labonte and Joe Nemechek, also failed to finish due to engine problems.|$|E

50|$|Donohue led {{the first}} 50 laps, then the lead traded hands during pit stops between Joe Leonard, Bobby Unser, {{as well as}} Al Unser. After leading a total of 52 <b>laps,</b> <b>Mark</b> Donohue dropped out on lap 66 with broken gears. He {{came to a stop}} in turn four, and parked the car in the infield, just north of the {{entrance}} to the pits.|$|R
50|$|After race leader David Coulthard {{was called}} for a pit-stop, his team-mate Kimi Räikkönen led the race on the 53rd lap, but a mistake allowed Giancarlo Fisichella to assume the lead on lap 54. Near {{the end of his}} 54th <b>lap,</b> <b>Mark</b> Webber crashed while exiting the final corner, {{bringing}} out the safety car. Fernando Alonso failed to slow for the waved yellow flags, and hit one of Webber's tyres at full speed on the 55th lap; his Renault crashed into a tyre wall protecting a guardrail, the impact damaging the barrier and sending car tyres across the circuit, effectively blocking the track and making continuation of the race, even behind the safety car, impossible. The race was subsequently red flagged, ending the race immediately for safety concerns.|$|E
50|$|On {{the day of}} the race, Mark gets {{behind when}} a tire goes flat. He enters the track again and starts to take the lead. While on the last <b>lap,</b> <b>Mark</b> loses control of his car and spins out just as he is about to pass the car in the lead. His car comes to a stop and before he can move out of the way, he is hit dead on by another car going full speed. Mark somehow comes out of this {{accident}} unscathed, but his partner Ed is killed. Jimmy, now an orphan, is staying with the Cohen's. Mark returns and the Cohen's decide to tell him they would like to adopt Jimmy. Before they are able to however, Mark asks Jimmy if he wants to come and live with him at his hotel. Jimmy accepts, Mark promises to send him to that military school, and Mrs. Cohen silently bursts into tears.|$|E
5000|$|Picasso painted La Lecture from December 1931 to its {{completion}} in January 1932 during, what art experts have named, his [...] "lovestruck period." [...] The painting is {{oil on panel}} and is 65.5 by 51 centimeters. Picasso has used bright colours, including yellow and green, to depict a nude Walter asleep in a chair with a book in her <b>lap.</b> <b>Mark</b> Brown of The Guardian said the book in Walter's lap is a [...] "sexual symbol" [...] and the painting {{has been described as}} being sensual, erotic and happy. Of the painting and Picasso, Philip Hook from Sotheby's said [...] "In the early 1930s he was very lyrically in love and reflected that in these gorgeous colors, and lovely compositions. This period is just about the most desirable of all Picasso's (periods), certainly in market terms." [...] As Picasso painted La Lecture just days apart from La Rêve, the two paintings are very similar in composition.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a bizarre}} event, during the pace <b>laps,</b> <b>Mark</b> Martin had a {{steering}} problem {{and crashed into}} Jimmie Johnson. Martin was black-flagged prior to the race start so NASCAR could verify his steering was working properly, while Johnson did not pit until {{the conclusion of the}} first green flag lap. Due to the caution free race, neither driver was able to recover from the incident.|$|R

50|$|During a caution, Dale Earnhardt, who was {{not running}} well, lost all four tires {{at the end of}} pit road after a pit stop(communication mix-up, lug nuts). His crew ran down pit lane with jacks and got him back on all fours but he lost a few <b>laps.</b> <b>Mark</b> Martin had a chance to {{capitalize}} on the misfortune but ended up losing a cylinder and finished 14th, 3 laps down.|$|R
50|$|The {{race was}} {{dominated}} by Emerson Fittipaldi for the first 400 miles. During that stretch, several contenders retired due to mechanical failures, including all three Penske machines. Top-five contenders Bobby Rahal, Jim Crawford, and Arie Luyendyk also {{dropped out of the}} race. Mario Andretti experienced electrical problems, which caused him to lose significant ground to the leader. Michael Andretti, who had started in the seventh row, had been chasing Fittipaldi the entire race and by the 150 <b>lap</b> <b>mark,</b> he was within sights of the leader. Meanwhile, Al Unser, Jr. remained on the leap lap in third place, despite being lapped earlier in the race. By this point, the three leaders had significant distance on the fourth place car of Raul Boesel. With less than 100 miles to go, Michael Andretti passed Fittipaldi for the lead, but his engine expired a few laps later, ending the young Andretti's bid for an Indy 500 win. Fittipaldi regained the lead, with Al Unser, Jr. second. The remainder of the field ran at least six laps behind.|$|E
50|$|During the 1974 Australian Touring Car Championship the Torana GTR XU-1 was {{gradually}} superseded by the wider bodied SL/R 5000. The Holden Bathurst contingent {{for this year}} included 13 SL/R 5000s, 7 XU-1s and one HQ Monaro GTS. Ford was represented in the outright category by three Falcon Hardtop headed by Moffat's Brut 33 XB Falcon Hardtop GT. He was supported by John Goss and Kevin Bartlett in an XA Hardtop and Murray Carter in another XB Falcon Hardtop. The V8 Toranas ran away {{at the start of}} the 1974 race and Holden victory seemed assured. By lap 11 Brock had already lapped 7 of the outright Class D cars. On lap 12 Moffat pitted and lost several laps as a new coil was fitted. By lap 20 the HDT Toranas of Brock and Bond were over a minute in front of Goss in the only competitive Falcon. By lap 85 the two HDT Toranas were four laps clear of the field. Around the 90 <b>lap</b> <b>mark</b> rain started to fall at the top of the mountain. he HDT Toranas soon pitted for wet weather tyres after which the Bond Torana started smoking from an oil leak. The car was eventually black flagged. While the mechanics were trying to fix the problem Brock pitted with a broken piston caused by a failed oil pump. Bond returned to the track but lost more time with a spin. Despite determined driving from Jim Richards and Wayne Negus, The Goss/Bartlett car was able to gain a slight lead as the Torana challenge faded amidst oil smoke and torrential rain. Bartlett completed the 163 laps in first place. The only other car on the same lap was the Forbes/Negus SL/R 5000. The smaller classes were won by a Morris Cooper S, an Alfa GTV and a Mazda RX3. Car number 34, a lone Morris Marina finished 6th in Class C having completed 125 laps.|$|E
50|$|Kyle Petty led 484 of 492 <b>laps.</b> <b>Mark</b> Martin (before he crashed) and Bill Elliott led 3 laps each, and Ernie Irvan led 2 during green flag pit stops. As {{a result}} of the {{domination}} and only 2 cautions in a 500-mile (805 km) race, only 2 cars finished on the lead lap. Despite the green flag look of the race, Petty beat Irvan by just under a second.|$|R
50|$|Race 1 {{was held}} on Saturday 25 March 2007.
