In {{temperate}} {{waters of the}} North Pacific they are found near the surface and are the ' basis of the troll and l ive-bait fishery off the w e s t coast of North America, and the live-bait fishery of Japan. Albacore are also found in deeper water in temperate, subtropical, and tropical areas, where they support the vast longline fisheries of the North and South Pacific. A composite s i z e frequency d i s t r i bu t i on of albacore sampled f r o m the U. S. west coast fishery in 1949 - 58 showed a length range of 44 to 101 cm, with a dominant mode at 65 m and a <b>lesser</b> <b>mode</b> at 76 crn. The length range of albacore caught in the Japanese live-bait fishery usually is f r o m about 62 to 37 em with a dominant mode at 83 cm. The range in length of albacore caught by the Japanese longline fishery in the North Pacific is about 50 to 120 em. Lmg-line fishery in the South Pacific takes albacore ranging f r o m 67 to 111 cm...|$|E

500|$|Bikes, {{as complex}} mechanisms, {{have a variety}} of modes: {{fundamental}} ways that they can move. These modes can be stable or unstable, depending on the bike parameters and its forward speed. In this context, [...] "stable" [...] means that an uncontrolled bike will continue rolling forward without falling over as long as forward speed is maintained. Conversely, [...] "unstable" [...] means that an uncontrolled bike will eventually fall over, even if forward speed is maintained. The modes can be differentiated by the speed at which they switch stability and the relative phases of leaning and steering as the bike experiences that mode. Any bike motion consists of a combination of various amounts of the possible modes, and there are three main modes that a bike can experience: capsize, weave, and wobble. A <b>lesser</b> known <b>mode</b> is rear wobble, and it is usually stable.|$|R
40|$|Slithering, crawling, slipping, gliding {{are various}} modes of limbless {{locomotion}} {{that have been}} mimicked for micro-manipulation of soft, slender and sessile objects. A <b>lesser</b> known <b>mode</b> is rolling which involves periodic, asymmetric and lateral muscular deformations. Here we enable an elastomeric cylinder of poly(dimethylsiloxane) to roll on a substrate by releasing small quantity of a solvent like chloroform, toluene, hexane, heptane and so on, which swells differentially {{a portion of the}} cylinder, but evaporates from portion of it which remains exposed to the atmosphere. In a dynamic situation, this asymmetric swelling-shrinking cycle generates a torque which drives the cylinder to roll. The driving torque is strong enough that the cylinder can roll up an inclined plane, within a range of inclination, its velocity even increases. The cylinder can even drag a dead weight significantly larger, ~ 8 - 10 times its own weight. A scaling law is derived for optimizing the rolling velocity. Comment: 17 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately, {{this very}} sharp {{switching}} {{on and off}} inherent to the square-waveform causes extremely high frequency vibrations in the lamp. A square wave {{can be thought of}} as an infinite sum of odd-numbered harmonics, which will include frequencies at the resonant frequency of the bulb, causing it to vibrate at that frequency like a bell or whistle. The lamp housing does not help this, acting as a resonating chamber that amplifies the noise and presents a problem for sync-sound recording for film and video. To correct this, most electronic ballasts are equipped with a silent mode that eliminates the higher frequencies, but rounds off the voltage transition, causing the same flicker issue with magnetics, though to a <b>lesser</b> extent. This <b>mode</b> provides safe, flicker-free filming at framerates up to 24 frame/s on most electronic ballasts.|$|R
2500|$|Again {{targeting}} the female demographic, the Cervo nameplate made a return in July 1990. Now, however, reflecting the new Kei Jidosha standards, the engine had grown by 110cc {{and it was}} [...] longer. More shockingly, the car was of a traditional two-box design, sold initially only as a 3-door hatchback. Eventually, the Cervo Mode developed into {{a full range of}} cars, coinciding with the discontinuation of the Fronte which had left a niche above the [...] "regular" [...] Alto. Reflecting the desired clientele, heartthrob Yūji Oda (織田裕二) appeared in the marketing campaign. [...] The Cervo Mode was initially only available with turbocharged 660cc engines of either 3- or 4-cylinder configurations. In November 1990 a 5-door version followed, along with <b>lesser</b> engines. The <b>Mode</b> looked more pedestrian than previous Cervos, with the Maruti built version (the [...] "Zen") in fact being marketed as the Alto in Europe.|$|R
40|$|During {{a period}} of {{economic}} reform, the People's Republic of China has emerged as an important market for multinational automobile manufacturers {{and a source of}} concern for “sustainable transport” advocates worried about the long-term sustainability of systems based on private automobiles and fossil fuels. Much of the growth in China's motor vehicle fleet and the negative consequences of that growth has been concentrated in China's large, economically dynamic coastal cities. Based on a large standardised 1995 database on urban transport, this paper compares characteristics of three of China's largest cities with cities around the world. This international comparative perspective suggests that in 1995, Chinese cities still had exceptionally high use of non-motorised and public transport modes. However, some characteristics of these cities indicated a high potential for extensive and rapid growth in private motor vehicles which could generate significant problems in the future. In particular, the relatively high population density and lack of reserved public transport routes suggested that the potential for highly concentrated negative impacts were in place, while the means of moving large numbers of people with <b>lesser</b> polluting <b>modes</b> of transport than the private motor vehicle were not in place. Finally, data on investment in public transport and freeways indicated that in the early 1990 s the conditions were being created for rapid and continued motorisation. While in 1995 China's cities in some ways approximated a “sustainable transport” ideal, this is likely to have already changed substantially...|$|R
50|$|Due to {{its success}} in the arcades, Gauntlet was ported to several home systems of the day. These {{platforms}} include DOS, Apple II, Atari 8-bit, MSX, NES, Apple IIGS, Sega Master System, Mega Drive/Genesis (as Gauntlet 4), Atari ST, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum, among others. In 2003, an emulated version of Gauntlet was included in Midway Arcade Treasures; a compilation of arcade games available for the Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Xbox consoles and Windows. For some machines, only Gauntlet II was converted, since it {{was considered to be}} more advanced than the original. In 1990, the original Game Boy received a version of Gauntlet II. 16-bit conversions (Atari ST and Mega Drive/Genesis) had similar sound and graphics as the original game, and retained the four-player <b>mode</b> (<b>lesser</b> machines only allowed a maximum of two players). A port of Gauntlet is also playable in Lego Dimensions, and the Thief enemy appears as one of the bosses in the story mode.|$|R
40|$|It is now {{something}} of a commonplace to discuss Robert Louis Stevenson as an innovator of romance. Genre debates at the fin-de-siècle have been well researched in relation to his fiction and, increasingly, his critical writings. Since Edwin Eiger (1966) and Robert Kiely (1964) published studies on Stevenson’s romance, the interplay between romance and realism that is evident in much of his work has been identified by Roslyn Jolly (1999), Roderick Watson (2004), Hilary J. Beattie (2004) and Michael Saler (2012) to name but a few. Rather than viewing this phenomenon {{through the lens of}} genre, which, as Anna Vaninskaya (2008) points out, can lead to unhelpful complications, it is more rewarding to understand Stevenson’s new romance aesthetic as related to his experimentation with time and space. Part of Stevenson’s approach to reviving the romance, set out in “A Gossip on Romance” and “A Humble Remonstrance”, involved adopting a serious literary perspective, rather than treating it as a <b>lesser</b> fictional <b>mode.</b> This aspiration included reinvigorating the traditional spaces of romance by investing them with a more complex temporality, creating new fictional worlds that operated as Bakhtinian chronotopes. Stevenson’s fiction invariably takes a “polychronotopic” form (following Pearce [1994]), which introduces a dialogic relationship between different methods of constructing time-space within a single text. Through this, Stevenson critiques traditional generic assumptions about the hero’s interaction with the romance world and applies a self-reflexive approach to understanding the text he is in the act of producing. This internal dialogic is often exposed in the narrative through Stevenson’s characters who behave beyond the scope of traditional “heroes”, often providing a mismatching perspective to that suggested by the worlds they inhabit over the course of their adventures. Stevenson transformed the romance for a new audience in a similar way to that which Bakhtin traces for the novel in Dostoevsky’s work. ...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{identification}} (St-Id) can {{be considered}} as the process of updating a finite element (FE) model of a structural system to match the measured response of the structure. This paper presents the St-Id of a laboratory-based steel through-truss cantilevered bridge with suspended span. There are a total of 600 degrees of freedom (DOFs) in the superstructure plus additional DOFs in the substructure. The St-Id of the bridge model used the modal parameters from a preliminary modal test in the objective function of a global optimisation technique using a layered genetic algorithm with patternsearch step (GAPS). Each layer of the St-Id process involved grouping of the structural parameters into a number of updating parameters and running parallel optimisations. The number of updating parameters was increased at each layer of the process. In order to accelerate the optimisation and ensure improved diversity within the population, a patternsearch step was applied to the fittest individuals {{at the end of each}} generation of the GA. The GAPS process was able to replicate the mode shapes for the first two lateral sway modes and the first vertical bending mode to a high degree of accuracy and, to a <b>lesser</b> degree, the <b>mode</b> shape of the first lateral bending mode. The mode shape and frequency of the torsional mode did not match very well. The frequencies of the first lateral bending mode, the first longitudinal mode and the first vertical mode matched very well. The frequency of the first sway mode was lower and that of the second sway mode was higher than the true values, indicating a possible problem with the FE model. Improvements to the model and the St-Id process will be presented at the upcoming conference and compared to the results presented in this paper. These improvements will include the use of multiple FE models in a multi-layered, multi-solution, GAPS St-Id approach...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is interested}} in how archival theory—the theoretical work of archiving produced by archivists and, to a <b>lesser</b> extent, the <b>modes</b> of doing archival research deployed by researchers—tackles the colonial roots and routes of archives, archivists and archival theories and practices. At the base of this examination of archival theory {{is the assumption that}} theory produces the object it evaluates. Thus, as opposed to interrogating a pre-existing archive, archival theory produces imaginative and material archival spaces in which archivists and researchers labour. In this dissertation, then, I examine the ways in which Eurocentric intellectual frameworks continue to frame archival theory and, thus, delimit how archivists and researchers produce knowledge about and through archives. In particular, this dissertation {{is interested in}} how the Eurocentrism underwriting archival theory as much shapes archivists’ understanding of colonialism and colonial archives by establishing the archive’s and archival theory’s geography, history and future trajectory as covers over the archives’ and archival theory’s colonial history. With an eye to the work of contemporary archivists and theorists who critically interrogate the ways archives and archivists reproduce unequal social relations of power, the following chapters negotiate the tension within these critiques between developing more democratic, socially just and postcolonial archives and archival theory, and the Eurocentric intellectual frameworks that reiterate the divisions between West and non-West, modern societies and traditional communities, literate and oral, and between reason and feeling. The works of Canadian archivists and scholars figure prominently in my dissertation as they both shape my analyses of the effects of Eurocentrism and continuing settler colonial relations on archives, archiving and archival research, and also become objects of analysis through which I trace out the discourses that work to secure and trouble settler title and entitlement to Aboriginal land by erasing or nullifying Indigenous sovereignty in and through Canada’s archives. The aim of my dissertation is to propose modes of archival knowledge production that trouble, if not displace, these Eurocentric and settler frameworks to decolonize archives and archival theory...|$|R
