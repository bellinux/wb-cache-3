50|$|Carbon steels {{which can}} {{successfully}} undergo heat-treatment have a carbon {{content in the}} range of 0.30-1.70% by weight.

Low-alloy carbon steel, such as A36 grade, contains about 0.05% sulfur and melts around 1426 - 1538 C. Manganese is often added to improve the hardenability of low-carbon steels.

5000|$|High-strength <b>low-alloy</b> <b>steel</b> (HSLA) {{is a type}} of {{alloy steel}} that {{provides}} better mechanical properties or greater resistance to corrosion than carbon steel. HSLA steels vary from other steels in that they are not made to meet a specific chemical composition but rather to specific mechanical properties. They have a carbon content between 0.05-0.25% to retain formability and weldability. Other alloying elements include up to 2.0% manganese and small quantities of copper, nickel, niobium, nitrogen, vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, titanium, calcium, rare earth elements, or zirconium. Copper, titanium, vanadium, and niobium are added for strengthening purposes. These elements are intended to alter the microstructure of carbon steels, which is usually a ferrite-pearlite aggregate, to produce a very fine dispersion of alloy carbides in an almost pure ferrite matrix. This eliminates the toughness-reducing effect of a pearlitic volume fraction yet maintains and increases the material's strength by refining the grain size, which in the case of ferrite increases yield strength by 50% for every halving of the mean grain diameter. Precipitation strengthening plays a minor role, too. Their yield strengths can be anywhere between [...] Because of their higher strength and toughness HSLA steels usually require 25 to 30% more power to form, as compared to carbon steels.|$|E
