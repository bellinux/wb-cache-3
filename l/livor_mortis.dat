5000|$|Among coroners {{and other}} investigators, such as {{homicide}} and forensic detectives, <b>livor</b> <b>mortis</b> {{is not considered}} an exact way to measure time of death, but instead {{is a way to}} approximate it. <b>Livor</b> <b>mortis,</b> along with algor mortis, rigor mortis, and practices such as forensic entomology are frequently combined by investigators to more accurately pinpoint the estimated time of death.|$|E
50|$|Another {{noteworthy}} {{transient condition}} is <b>livor</b> <b>mortis,</b> the purplish pooling of blood {{within the body}} after the heart has stopped beating. Emergency responders are instructed to recognize {{it as a sign}} that CPR should not be attempted. Investigators may use it to determine if a body has been moved or repositioned after death. <b>Livor</b> <b>mortis</b> starts 20 minutes to 3 hours after death and is congealed in the capillaries in 4 to 5 hours. Maximum lividity occurs within 6-12 hours.|$|E
40|$|A precise {{estimation}} of the postmortem interval (PMI) {{is one of the}} most important topics in forensic pathology. However, the PMI estimation is based mainly on the visual observation of cadaverous pheno- mena (e. g. algor, <b>livor</b> and rigor <b>mortis)</b> and on alternative methods such as thanatochemistry that remain relatively imprecise. The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the kinetic alterations of several bio- chemical parameters (i. e. proteins, enzymes, substrates, electrolytes and lipids) during putrefaction of human blood. For this purpose, we performed kinetic biochemical analysis during a 264 hour period. The results showed a significant linear correlation between total and direct bilirubin, urea, uric acid, transferrin, immunoglobulin M (IgM), creatine kinase (CK), aspartate transaminase (AST), calcium and iron with the time of blood putrefaction. These parameters allowed us to develop two mathematical models that may have predictive values and become important complementary tools of traditional methods to achieve a more accurate PMI estimationFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT) for his Investigator Grant (IF/ 01147 / 2013...|$|R
40|$|Pathologically {{elevated}} body core temperature, {{measured at}} the death scene, is an important finding in medico-legal investigation of violent deaths. An abnormally high rectal temperature at any death scene may point to an underlying pathology, the influence of certain drugs or a hidden cerebral traumatism, and death by suffocation which would remain undetected without further medico-legal investigations. Furthermore, hyperthermia and fever, if unrecognized, may result in an erroneous forensic estimation of time since death in the early postmortem period by the "Henssge method. " By a retrospective study of 744 cases, the authors demonstrate that hyperthermia is a finding with an incidence of 10 % of all cases of violent death. The main causes are: influence of drugs, malignant tumors, cerebral hypoxia {{as a result of}} suffocation, infections, and systemic inflammatory disorders. As a consequence it must be stated, that hyperthermia must be excluded in every medico-legal death scene investigation by a correct measurement of body core temperature and a comparison between the cooling rate of the body and the behavior of early postmortem changes, notably <b>livor</b> and rigor <b>mortis...</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 1-2 days: Pallor Mortis, Algor Mortis, Rigor Mortis, and <b>Livor</b> <b>Mortis</b> are {{the first}} steps {{in the process of}} {{decomposition}} before the process of putrefaction.|$|E
50|$|Pallor mortis {{results from}} the {{cessation}} of capillary circulation throughout the body. Gravity then causes the blood to sink down into the lower parts of the body, creating <b>livor</b> <b>mortis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Livor</b> <b>mortis</b> (lividity), {{indicating}} that the body has been pulseless {{and in the same}} position long enough for blood to sink and collect within the body, creating purplish discolorations at the lowest points of the body (with respect to gravity).|$|E
50|$|Coroners {{can use the}} {{presence}} or absence of <b>livor</b> <b>mortis</b> as a means of determining an approximate time of death. It can also be used by forensic investigators to determine whether or not a body has been moved. For instance, if the body is found lying prone, but the pooling is present on the deceased's back, investigators can conclude that the body was originally positioned supine.|$|E
50|$|In {{forensic}} investigation, {{the time}} of occurrence of an event (such as time of death, time of incident) {{is one of the}} most important things to determine accurately as soon as possible. Sometimes this can only be estimated. Some indicators that investigators use are rigor mortis, <b>livor</b> <b>mortis,</b> algor mortis, clouding of the corneas, state of decomposition, presence/absence of purged fluids and level of tissue desiccation.|$|E
5000|$|The fresh {{stage of}} {{decomposition}} is generally {{described as the}} period between the moment of death and when {{the first signs of}} bloat are apparent. [...] There are no outward signs of physical change, though internal bacteria have begun to digest organ tissues. [...] No odor is associated with the carcass. [...] Early post-mortem changes, used by pathologists as medical markers for early post-mortem interval estimations, have been described by Goff and include <b>livor</b> <b>mortis,</b> rigor mortis and algor mortis.|$|E
50|$|Although Lake Monoun is {{near the}} center of a {{volcanic}} field that includes at least 34 recent craters, the subsequent investigation found that the event was not caused by an eruption or sudden ejection of volcanic gas from the lake. Rather, emission of carbon dioxide in a limnic eruption is thought to be to blame. The cloud's smell and skin damage to victims were not fully explained. Some theories attribute the skin problems to a combination of preexisting conditions and routine postmortem effects like <b>livor</b> <b>mortis,</b> although there is no clear consensus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Livor</b> <b>mortis</b> {{starts in}} 20-30 minutes, but {{is usually not}} {{observable}} by the human eye until two hours after death. The size of the patches increases {{in the next three}} to six hours, with maximum lividity occurring between eight and twelve hours after death. The blood pools into the interstitial tissues of the body. The intensity of the color depends upon the amount of reduced haemoglobin in the blood. The discoloration does not occur in the areas of the body that are in contact with the ground or another object, in which capillaries are compressed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{degree of}} rigor mortis {{may be used}} in {{forensic}} pathology, to determine the approximate time of death. A dead body holds its position as rigor mortis sets in. If the body is moved after death, but before rigor mortis begins, forensic techniques such as <b>livor</b> <b>mortis</b> can be applied. If the position in which a body is found does not match the location where it is found (for example, if it is flat on its back with one arm sticking straight up), that could mean someone moved it.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Livor</b> <b>mortis</b> (Latin: livor—"bluish color," [...] mortis—"of death"), postmortem {{lividity}} (Latin: postmortem—"after death", lividity—"black and blue"), hypostasis (Greek: hypo, meaning [...] "under, beneath"; stasis, meaning [...] "a standing") or suggillation, {{is the fourth}} stage {{and one of the}} signs of death. It is a settling of the blood in the lower (dependent) portion of the body post mortem, causing a purplish red discoloration of the skin. When the heart stops functioning and is no longer agitating the blood, heavy red blood cells sink through the serum by action of gravity.|$|E
5000|$|Among {{those animals}} {{that have a}} heart, the [...] "fresh" [...] stage begins {{immediately}} after the heart stops beating. From the moment of death, the body begins cooling or warming to match {{the temperature of the}} ambient environment, during a stage called algor mortis. [...] Shortly after death, within three to six hours, the muscular tissues become rigid and incapable of relaxing, during a stage called rigor mortis. Since blood is no longer being pumped through the body, gravity causes it to drain to the dependent portions of the body, creating an overall bluish-purple discolouration termed <b>livor</b> <b>mortis</b> or, more commonly, lividity.|$|E
5000|$|Putrefaction is {{the fifth}} stage of death, {{following}} pallor mortis, algor mortis, rigor mortis, and <b>livor</b> <b>mortis.</b> This process references the breaking down of a body of a human or animal post mortem (meaning after death). In broad terms, it {{can be viewed as}} the decomposition of proteins, and the eventual breakdown of the cohesiveness between tissues, and the liquefaction of most organs. This is caused by the decomposition of organic matter by bacterial or fungal digestion, which causes the release of gases that infiltrate the body's tissues, and leads to the deterioration of the tissues and organs. The approximate time it takes putrefaction to occur is dependent on various factors. Internal factors that affect the rate of putrefaction include the age at which death has occurred, the overall structure and condition of the body, the cause of death, and external injuries arising before or after death. External factors include environmental temperature, moisture and air exposure, clothing, burial factors, and light exposure.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} biologically {{motivated}} <b>livor</b> <b>mortis</b> simulation that {{is capable of}} modelling the colouration changes in skin caused by blood pooling after death. Our approach consists of a simulation of post mortem blood dynamics and a layered skin shader that is controlled by the haemoglobin and oxygen levels in blood. The object is represented by a layered data structure made of a triangle mesh for the skin and a tetrahedral mesh on which the blood dynamics are simulated. This allows us to simulate the skin discolouration caused by <b>livor</b> <b>mortis,</b> including early patchy appearance, fixation of hypostasis and pressure induced blanching. We demonstrate our approach on two different models and scenarios and compare the results to real world <b>livor</b> <b>mortis</b> photographic examples...|$|E
40|$|Organic {{bodies are}} subject to {{internal}} biological, chemical and physical processes as well as environmental interactions after death, which cause significant structural and optical changes. Simulating corpse decomposition and the environmental effects on its surface can help improve the realism of computer generated scenes and provide {{the impression of a}} living, dynamic environment. The aim of this doctorate thesis is to simulate post mortem processes of the human body and their visual effects on its appearance. The proposed method is divided into three processes; surface weathering due to environmental activities, <b>livor</b> <b>mortis</b> and natural mummification by desiccation. The decomposing body is modelled by a layered model consisting of a tetrahedral mesh representing the volume and a high resolution triangle surface mesh representing the skin. A particle-based surface weathering approach is employed to add environmental effects. The particles transport substances that are deposited on the object’s surface. A novel, biologically-inspired blood pooling simulation is used to recreate the physical processes of <b>livor</b> <b>mortis</b> and its visual effects on the corpse’s appearance. For the mummification, a physically-based approach is used to simulate the moisture diffusion process inside the object and the resulting de- formations of the volume and skin. In order to simulate the colouration changes associated with <b>livor</b> <b>mortis</b> and mummification, a chemically-based layered skin shader that considers time and spatially varying haemoglobin, oxygen and moisture contents is proposed. The suggested approach is able to model changes in the internal structure and the surface appearance of the body that resemble the post mortem processes <b>livor</b> <b>mortis,</b> natural mummification by desiccation and surface weathering. The surface weathering approach is able to add blemishes, such as rust and moss, to an object’s surface while avoiding inconsistencies in deposit sizes and dis- continuities on texture seams. The <b>livor</b> <b>mortis</b> approach is able to model the pink colouration changes caused by blood pooling, pressure induced blanching effects, fixation of hypostasis and the purple discolouration due to oxygen loss in blood. The mummification method is able to reproduce volume shrinkage effects caused by moisture loss, skin wrinkling and skin darkening that are comparable to real mummies...|$|E
30|$|By {{using the}} rate-of-change methodology, early TSD can be {{estimated}} {{on the basis of}} observational changes occur in human body after the death. The cooling of the body after death (algor mortis), the gradual stiffening of the body (rigor mortis) and the fixed pooling of the blood resulting in discoloration of the lower portions of the body (<b>livor</b> <b>mortis)</b> can be easily assessed with minimal instrumentation (Clark et al. 1997).|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{disclose}} the characteristics of postmortem forensic imaging; give an overview of the several possible findings in postmortem imaging, which are uncommon or new to clinical radiologists; and discuss the possible pitfalls. Unspecific postmortem signs are enlisted and specific signs shall be presented, which are typical for one cause of death. Unspecific signs. <b>Livor</b> <b>mortis</b> may not only be seen from the outside, but also inside the body in the lungs: in chest CT internal <b>livor</b> <b>mortis</b> appear as ground glass opacity in the dependent lower lobes. The aortic wall is often hyperdense in postmortem CT due to wall contraction and loss of luminal pressure. Gas bubbles are very common postmortem due to systemic gas embolism after major open trauma, artificial respiration or initial decomposition; in particular putrefaction produces gas bubbles globally. Specific signs. Intracranial bleeding is hyperattenuating both in radiology and in postmortem imaging. Signs of strangulation are hemorrhage in the soft tissue of the neck like skin, subcutaneous tissue, platysma muscle and lymph nodes. The "vanishing" aorta is indicative for exsanguination. Fluid in the airways with mosaic lung densities and emphysema (aquosum) is typical for fresh-water drowning...|$|E
30|$|Since decades, many {{methods have}} been used to {{determine}} the PMI including physical, biochemical and entomological methods (Sato et al., 2015). The earliest changes after death (within the first 24  h postmortem) include the development and regression of rigor mortis, the progression of <b>livor</b> <b>mortis</b> and algor mortis. Although these methods are applied to assess the PMI in daily forensic work, there are still great inaccuracies and limitations (Pittner et al., 2016). Several days postmortem, forensic entomology has shown to provide valuable information about the time since death. Yet, this method is still affected by changes in weather conditions, and exposure of the body (Verma & Paul, 2013).|$|E
40|$|A 63 -year-old woman {{underwent}} a nephrectomy {{on the right}} side for renal cancer. Postoperatively she developed abdominal and lower back pain, which was treated with an injection of analgesics in an epidural catheter. The following morning it was discovered that the patient had cold legs with pallor and no palpable femoral pulse. Rigor mortis and <b>livor</b> <b>mortis</b> were diagnosed in both legs, even though the patient was still alive and awake. Doppler ultrasound examination revealed the absence of blood flow in {{the lower part of the}} abdominal aorta and distally. A cross disciplinary conference including specialists in urology, orthopaedics, vascular surgery, anaesthesiology, internal medicine, and intensive care concluded that no lifesaving treatment was possible, and the patient died the following day. A forensic autopsy revealed severe atherosclerosis with thrombosis and dissection of the abdominal aorta. This case clearly demonstrates that a vascular emergency should be considered when patients complain about pain in the lower back, abdomen or limbs. Clinicians should be especially aware of symptoms of tissue death that can be masked by epidural analgesia...|$|E
40|$|Decomposition is {{degradation}} process of a corpse into basic respective constituents macroscopically and microscopically by action of microorganisms, arthropods and scavengers. Post mortem changes could be separated into early post mortem changes (i. e. algor mortis, rigor mortis and <b>livor</b> <b>mortis)</b> and putrefaction stages of corpse. These changes function as suitable indicators for determination of post mortem interval (PMI). In this paper, {{different stages of}} post mortem changes, possible variations such as mummification and formation of adipocere and special circumstances such as burial condition is discussed. This article also refers to several arguments in the different texture of adipocere {{and the influence of}} different types of fabric in affecting the post mortem changes and formation of adipocere. This is largely due to the property of permeability and resistance of material against {{degradation process}}. Undeniably, decomposition process involves numerous potential variables including burial condition, presence of clothing, potential formation of adipocere and mummification. Hence, studies in forensic taphonomy combined with real case scenario are crucial in understanding the nature of decomposition and estimation of PMI with higher accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Through the {{widespread}} use of postmortem computed tomography, inner livores of the lungs have become a frequently observed phenomenon in the field of forensic medicine. Yet their time-dependent development, notably in comparison with the widely studied external livores, remains poorly understood. We present a unique homicide case where the victim was discovered in supine position with correspondent external livores fixed exclusively on the rear side. Yet upon postmortem computed tomography, the victim presented pronounced inner livores within the depending dorsal areas of both lungs but also vertical sedimentation levels solely within the right lung, suggesting an initial right-hand side position and a postmortem re-positioning of the body. Interestingly, this was consistent with tangible hints of postmortem manipulation on-site. It is likely that this repositioning occurred sometime during the early postmortem interval (< 6  h) as the external livores have completely rearranged to the final supine position. The presented case suggests different development patterns of inner and outer livores, highlighting the necessity for controlled studies that explore the formation and fixation processes of <b>livor</b> <b>mortis</b> in internal organs. A better understanding of these issues can prove useful in forensic examinations...|$|E
40|$|An {{estimation}} of the post mortem interval (PMI) is frequently touted as the Holy Grail of forensic pathology. During the first hours after death, PMI estimation {{is dependent on the}} rate of physical observable modifications including algor, rigor and <b>livor</b> <b>mortis.</b> However, these assessment methods are still largely unreliable and inaccurate. Alternatively, RNA has been put forward as a valuable tool in forensic pathology, namely to identify body fluids, estimate the age of biological stains and to study the mechanism of death. Nevertheless, the attempts to find correlation between RNA degradation and PMI have been unsuccessful. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the RNA degradation in different post mortem tissues in order to develop a mathematical model that can be used as coadjuvant method for a more accurate PMI determination. For this purpose, we performed an eleven-hour kinetic analysis of total extracted RNA from murine’s visceral and muscle tissues. The degradation profile of total RNA and the expression levels of several reference genes were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. A quantitative analysis of normalized transcript levels on the former tissues allowed the identification of four quadriceps muscle genes (Actb, Gapdh, Ppia and Srp 72) that were found to significantly correlate with PMI. These results allowed us to develop a mathematical model with predictive value for {{estimation of}} the PMI (confidence interval o...|$|E
40|$|Veterinary pathologists {{commonly}} encounter lesions of blunt trauma. The {{development of}} lesions {{is affected by}} the object's mass, velocity, size, shape, and angle of impact and by the plasticity and mobility of the impacted organ. Scrape, impact, and pattern abrasions cause localized epidermal loss and sometimes broken hairs and implanted foreign material. Contusions are best identified after reflecting the skin, and must be differentiated from coagulopathies and <b>livor</b> <b>mortis.</b> Lacerations-traumatic tissue tears-may have irregular margins, bridging by more resilient tissue, deviation of the wound tail, crushed hairs, and unilateral abrasion. Hanging or choking can cause circumferential cervical abrasions, contusions and rupture of hairs, hyoid bone fractures, and congestion of the head. Other special forms of blunt trauma include fractured nails, pressure sores, and dog bites. Ocular blunt trauma causes extraocular and intraocular hemorrhages, proptosis, or retinal detachment. The thoracic viscera are relatively protected from blunt trauma but may develop hemorrhages in intercostal muscles, rib fractures, pulmonary or cardiac contusions or lacerations with subsequent hemothorax, pneumothorax, or cardiac arrhythmia. The abdominal wall is resilient and moveable, yet the liver and spleen are susceptible to traumatic laceration or rupture. Whereas extravasation of blood can occur after death, evidence of vital injury includes leukocyte infiltration, erythrophagocytosis, hemosiderin, reparative lesions of fibroblast proliferation, myocyte regeneration in muscle, and callus formation in bone. Understanding these processes aids in the diagnosis of blunt force trauma including estimation of the age of resulting injuries...|$|E
40|$|Herein, {{we present}} a rare case of suicidal {{intoxication}} with carbon monoxide produced via reaction of formic and sulphuric acid with additional toxic effect of formic acid. The deceased was a 22 -year-old men found dead in the bathroom locked from the inside. A bucket filled with liquid was found next to him, together with an almost empty canister labeled "formic acid" and another empty unlabeled canister. The postmortem examination revealed corrosive burns of the face, neck and chest, cherry-pink <b>livor</b> <b>mortis,</b> corrosive injury to the oropharyngeal area and trachea, subpleural petechiae, 100 mL of blood in stomach and superficial erosions of stomach mucosa. Toxicology analysis revealed 30 % of carboxyhemoglobin in the femoral blood {{and the presence of}} the formic acid in various samples. Quantitative analysis of formic acid was performed by measuring methyl ester derivative of formic acid by using headspace gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. The highest concentration of formic acid was measured in the lungs (0. 55 g/kg), gastric content (0. 39 g/L), and blood (0. 28 g/L). In addition, it was established that content of the unlabeled canister had a pH value of 0. 79 and contained sulphuric ions. Morphological and toxicology findings suggested that the main route of exposure to formic acid was inhalation of vapors with a possible ingestion of only small amount of liquid acid. The cause of death was determined to be combined intoxication with carbon monoxide and formic acid...|$|E
40|$|After {{attending}} this presentation, attendees {{will understand}} that forensic investigations {{are based on a}} multidisciplinary approach in which autopsy findings and toxicological results often result in association with circumstances and crime scene investigations. This presentation will impact the forensic science community by demonstrating how recreational abuse of anesthetic and sedative agents in health care practitioners, especially anesthesiologists is an increasing event. This presentation will also show an unusual case of suicide in which the manner and means of suicide was dependent upon the occupation of the victim. Presented is a case of a 50 -year-old man, anesthetist at the main local hospital, who was found dead in the house where he lived alone since separating from his wife. On the previous evening he was found on the landing’s floor with an occipital bruise injury and treated in the Emergency Department. The next day his brother, alerted by his colleagues that tried in vain to contact him, went to his house. He found that the front door had been left ajar, with a piece of furniture behind it. When he entered the flat, he noticed the corpse of the brother, supine on the living room’s floor near a piece of furniture. There were two drips with intravenous tubes almost empty (approximately 1 ml). One drip was still inserted in the dorsum of the victim’s right hand with tube for intravenous drip totally open. On the glass of this drip there was written “Miclela Caput” (meaning “Caput Mixture,” written incorrectly). On the glass of the other drip there was written “ 500 TPS+ 200 DIPR” (meaning Sodium Thiopental+Diprivan). In the house there were some empty blisters of Zolpidem, more than 20 packs of different drugs (some of them empty), an ash-tray containing white liquid, several empty ampoules of Propofol, Midazolam and Thiopental, and several new and used syringes. In the bedroom there were two knapsacks containing pornographic materials and four plastic phalli. External examination revealed abundant <b>livor</b> <b>mortis,</b> numerous recent needle marks with fresh and older hemorrhages in both arms, and a sutured occipital injury. Autopsy and histological findings were pulmonary and brain oedema, moderate fatty liver, acute poly-visceral congestion, hemorrhagic pancreatitis. Systematic toxicological analysis was performed on biological and non biological samples for alcohol, drugs of abuse and pharmaceuticals. Blood toxicological examination by GC/MS revealed lethal concentration of Zolpidem (0. 86 μg/ml) and high therapeutic blood concentrations of Propofol (0. 30 μg/ml), Midazolam (0. 08 μg/ml), Amitriptyline (0. 07 μg/ml), and low concentration of Thiopental (0. 03 μg/ml). Zolpidem was also found in gastric content while Thiopental was found in urine. Hair segment analysis (0 – 2 cm) revealed Propofol (4, 7 μg/mg) and the presence of Zolpidem, Amitriptyline and Ketoprofen. Residual’s toxicological analysis of the inserted drip (“Caput mixture”) revealed Propofol and Midazolam (approximately 1, 9 and 0, 08 mg/ml). Analysis of the non-inserted drip, showed Propofol and Thiopental (approximately 2 and 5 mg/ml). The low blood concentration of Thiopental suggests a self administration of the non-inserted drip at least 12 hours before death. The blood Propofol level was lower than or within the commonly accepted therapeutic range of 1. 3 – 6. 8 μg/ml after a standard anesthetic induction dose. Published reports indicate that in most cases, the postmortem Propofol concentrations were at therapeutic levels. It {{should be pointed out that}} especially for those agents used in anesthesia; the therapeutic concentrations refer to patients being supported respiratorywise, while in non-supported or non-intubated patients such concentrations may be lethal. Most of those deaths are thought to have occurred because of the rapidity of Propofol’s injection which led to apnea and death. A mere interpretation of the blood and tissue concentrations of Propofol in the toxicological analysis may be of limited diagnostic significance without taking into account the before mentioned reports. Toxicological analysis of hair confirmed the recreational abuse of Propofol. These anesthetic and sedative drugs are often used in combination for anesthesia’s induction. All of these act synergistically in combination and may induce respiratory depression. This effect depends on individual susceptibility, on dose used and, especially for Propofol and Midazolam, infusion’s rapidity. In conclusion, the victim was administered a solution of anesthetic drugs, rapidly infused in a lethal combination and simultaneously a hypnotic drug in lethal dose...|$|E
