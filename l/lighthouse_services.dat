40|$|Lighthouse and the Trinity House case have {{triggered}} extensive {{debate on the}} possibility of private production of public goods and, more especially, <b>lighthouse</b> <b>services</b> provision. This contribution sums up current academic debate about lighthouse provision. It shows that the English system of <b>lighthouse</b> <b>services</b> provision cannot be rigorously considered as an example of private provision. Some historical experiences have shown that private provision was possible, although governmental hindrances restrained a full-fledged market process provision. This contribution defends the interest of mobilizing a political economy perspective for an understanding of the different frameworks and institutional designs for providing such services. Some national cases illustrate and sustain the proposed political economy framework...|$|E

40|$|Lighthouse {{is seen as}} {{the example}} of public goods and an {{illustration}} of market failure. Since the publishing of Coase’s article, ‘Lighhouse in Economics’, a debate about the ability of private agents to provide a public good has been raised. More recent articles debated on the interpretation of Coase’s historical example, Trinity’s House, as a failed private entrepreneurship or public provision. Our contribution provides another interpretation of economics of lighthouse. Theoretically, this debate illustrates the importance of the cost of exclusion and the cost of defining property rights in production, and how to deal with these characteristics. Another dimension concerns the institutional dimension for the provision of <b>lighthouse</b> <b>services.</b> Nor a pure private provision, nor a public production, <b>lighthouse</b> <b>services</b> are provided in particular institutional contexts of mixed economy, which has to be taken into account. This contribution deals also with the issue concerning the political dimension of the lighthouse service provision. Cost and productive dimensions are important, political stakes are not less crucial, suggesting that lighthouse service provision results from particular governance systems and has to be thought in terms of a political economy analysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss the {{incentive}} structure or the mechanism that defines the private and public provision of public goods. Analytic narratives are used based on historical studies of the provision of <b>lighthouse</b> <b>services</b> in Estonia. The latter allows a theoretical discussion over the boundaries of private initiatives in public good provision and also allows a dialogue with Coasean principles. Findings show that there is no clear-cut division between private and public provision, rather throughout history there have been some combinations of private and public provision. Private agents are only able to provide lighthouses with the aid of supportive institutions – rewards for lighthouse owners and credible threat of punishments to the ship owners. Rewards must be at least as big as costs of exclusion, e. g. central collection of light dues; punishment of the ships that shrink in payment; provision of information about light dues and technical matters...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{contributions to}} public goods where contributors receive private benefits {{based on the}} amount of their contribution. This turns out to be equivalent to Andreoni’s warm glow model, and has interesting properties {{in the case of a}} discrete public good. Those who raise funds for a public purpose often offer private inducements to contributors such as gifts that depend on the level of contribution a contributor makes. This is a way of tying a contribution to a public good and a private good together. Public TV. Public TV fundraisers often offer private gifts, such as DVDs of special performances as an inducement to contribute. There may be a range of gifts that depend on the amount contributed. A common variation to have a public contribution rewarded by an invitation to a private party or “charity ball. ” The term “gift ” is slightly misleading, as the gift should really be viewed as a form of compensation for contributing to the public good. Lighthouses. In a well-known paper, Coase [1974] describe the provision of lighthouses in England. Typically, customs officials collected lighthouse fees from ships who docked at ports where their journeys benefited from the <b>lighthouse</b> <b>services.</b> In this case, one could view the total payment as a contribution to the provision of the public lighthouse, with the dock usage as a private “gift. ” (See Varian [1994] for further discussion of Coase’s lighthouse paper. ...|$|E
