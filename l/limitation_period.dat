After a series of problems emerged, including vagueness on a point even the House of Lords was unable to clarify and poor draftsmanship, the Act was repealed bit by bit during the 1970s, with the Limitation Act 1980 scrapping the last remaining sections.|$|E

The <b>limitation</b> <b>period</b> remains the same (12 years) but instead of the original owner's title to the land being extinguished, the original owner holds the land on trust for the adverse possessor.

25|$|As {{had been}} the case for {{ratification}} in 1950, the Labour government concluded in 1965 {{that there was little}} to be lost from giving in to the pressure to recognise the Court and the right of petition. In December 1965, Wilson informed the House of Commons that the right of petition would be recognised for an initial period of three years. At the time the government were concerned that the Burmah Oil Company would take advantage of the new right to contest the legality of the War Damage Act 1965 depriving the company of the right to compensation for damage caused during World War II as recognised by a House of Lords' decision, the acceptance was timed to fall outside the six-month <b>limitation</b> <b>period</b> for challenges to the Act and the United Kingdom's acceptance also explicitly stated that it applied only to claims arising after its effective date. The declarations of acceptance were deposited by Robert Boothby MP with the Secretary General of the Council of Europe on 14 January 1966.|$|E
40|$|There {{are four}} issues when {{the law of}} <b>limitation</b> <b>periods</b> is {{mandatory}}: Firstly, the public interests, which the law of <b>limitation</b> <b>periods</b> can help to protect, cannot {{be the basis of}} the mandatory nature of the law of <b>limitation</b> <b>periods,</b> because these interests are relatively weaker than other interests protected by law. Secondly, the mandatory nature of the law of <b>limitation</b> <b>periods</b> shapes it as an unchangeable norm group, which is in contradiction with some specific rules of the law of <b>limitation</b> <b>periods.</b> Thirdly, according to legal practices, the contractual agreement about <b>limitation</b> <b>periods</b> cannot easily jeopardize the public interests protected by the law of <b>limitation</b> <b>periods.</b> On the contrary, the mandatory nature of <b>limitation</b> <b>periods</b> will not only frustrate the reasonable expectations of the parties, but also induce bad faith behaviors, and trigger the trust crisis of the society. Lastly, the legislations in comparative law cannot be used as evidence for Section 2 of “Provisions of the Law of Limitation Periods”. Instead, they reveal the crisis of the mandatory nature of the law of <b>limitation</b> <b>periods.</b> In the context that the law of <b>limitation</b> <b>periods</b> should be dispositive, some boundaries can be set to meet special needs of the parties under special circumstances...|$|R
40|$|Forty-two U. S. C. section 1983 {{provides}} {{individuals with}} a federal cause of action for violations of their constitutional rights by persons acting under color of state law. The statute itself contains no <b>limitations</b> <b>period</b> for the filing of suits and, in keeping with settled federal practice, the lower federal courts have looked to state law to determine the proper <b>limitations</b> <b>period.</b> Because the lower courts adopted various inconsistent approaches to determining the appropriate state <b>limitations</b> <b>period,</b> the Supreme Court, in Wilson v. Garcia, held in 1985 that the federal courts should adopt the state <b>limitations</b> <b>period</b> for personal injury actions. In {{approximately half of the}} states, however, there are two <b>limitations</b> <b>periods</b> for personal injury actions: a shorter period for certain named intentional torts and a longer period for the residue of personal injury actions. The lower federal courts have split on the question of which of the two <b>limitations</b> <b>periods</b> should be applied. This article examines the rationale employed by the courts in selecting either the shorter or longer <b>limitations</b> <b>period.</b> The article then presents a theory that supports adoption of the longer, general personal injury <b>limitations</b> <b>period</b> rather than the shorter <b>limitations</b> <b>period</b> applicable to intentional torts. The article concludes with the application of this theory to Maryland statutory law...|$|R
40|$|This Comment {{argues that}} {{inconsistent}} application of <b>limitations</b> <b>periods</b> to ATCA claims {{does not provide}} sufficient and certain notice to potential parties {{to allow them to}} bring a timely claim, thereby potentially denying them an opportunity to receive a fair hearing in federal courts. Absent a U. S. Supreme Court ruling to provide consistent guidance on the applicable ATCA <b>limitations</b> <b>period,</b> Congress should amend the statute to provide a specific ten-year <b>limitations</b> <b>period</b> for most torts. Because both international and U. S. laws provide that murder committed as part of the crime of genocide has no statute of limitations, 2 ̆ 2 ATCA claims arising from genocidal acts should also be free of any <b>limitations</b> <b>period.</b> Part II provides general background on statute of limitations jurisprudence and related concepts, such as borrowing statutes, the doctrines of repose and laches, equitable tolling, and the discovery rule. Part II also examines the application of limitations law in federal courts.

500|$|The {{main problem}} with the Act was {{whether or not the}} {{claimant}} had to know he had a method of action or not for the standard <b>limitation</b> <b>period</b> to apply. The House of Lords had an opportunity to resolve this in Central Asbestos Co Ltd v Dodd but [...] "failed spectacularly", making a decision so confused that the Court of Appeal in Harper and others v National Coal Board said they could not actually find a ratio decidendi anywhere in the House of Lords' opinion. The Act also suffered from drafting problems - in Central Asbestos Lord Reid described it as having [...] "a strong claim to the distinction of being the worst drafted Act on the statute book". The Act was repealed piecemeal by a series of Acts during the 1970s, and the Limitation Act 1980 finally repealed the last remaining sections.|$|E
500|$|The Act met a mixed review from {{academic}}s. North praised it, {{saying that}} [...] "The Act admirably disposes of confusion, controversy, illogicality and point-less distinctions", while admitting that the vagueness {{of much of}} it left {{it up to the}} courts to flesh out the statute. Others were more critical; academic Vera Bermingham pointed out that the exclusion of liability for [...] "approved scheme" [...] buildings under Section 2 at the time included almost all new houses built within the United Kingdom, although these schemes have been much reduced since the 1980s. At the same time, actions brought under the Act are the subject of a six-year <b>limitation</b> <b>period</b> starting on the date the dwelling is completed, regardless of when the defect is discovered, which is a [...] "significant [...] in the utility of the [...] ". Academic John Spencer criticised both Section 1 and Section 3, the former for being too vaguely worded and the latter for being too specific. Spencer argues that, because of limitations imposed by the bill's sponsors, the original meaning of the draft bill was changed, and the Act itself goes no further than the existing common law.|$|E

2500|$|On September 3, 1998, Patrick Day {{was convicted}} of second-degree murder in Florida state court and sentenced to {{imprisonment}} for 55 years. After the Florida First District Court of Appeals affirmed Day's conviction and sentence, the AEDPA 365-day statute of limitations for Day to obtain federal habeas corpus relief began to run on March 20, 2000. On March 9, 2001, Day filed a post-conviction petition under Florida state procedure, which tolled the <b>limitation</b> <b>period</b> for filing a habeas petition until December 3, 2002, when the First District Court of Appeals issued its mandate denying Day collateral relief. [...] By then, Day had used 353 of his allotted 365 days, and accordingly had until December 16, 2002, to file a federal habeas petition.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2003, {{the court}} sua sponte issued {{an order to}} show cause why Day's {{petition}} should not be dismissed as untimely. [...] Day made three arguments against dismissal. First, Day argued that the court should not dismiss his complaint after it had been pending {{for nearly a year}} without any suggestion that it was untimely. Second, Day argued that he had 90 days from the denial of his motion for rehearing on collateral appeal to file a petition for a writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court. Under his calculation, the <b>limitation</b> <b>period</b> for filing his federal habeas petition did not run until 90 days after November 15, 2002. Third, Day argued that the state public defenders withheld his trial transcript for 352 days, and the delay cost him time in which he could have worked toward filing his appeals.|$|E

40|$|Congress {{enacted the}} Resource Conservation and Recovery Act [RCRA] {{to deal with}} the safe and long term {{disposal}} of our nations solid and hazardous wastes. RCRA does not include a <b>limitations</b> <b>period</b> within its statutory language. Various federal district and circuit courts of appeal have applied the general five-year statute of limitations to civil penalties under other environmental statutes. RCRA 2 ̆ 7 s goals and policies, however, differ from these statutes in many respects. It is likely that the federal courts will also apply the general federal five-year statute of limitations to RCRA civil penalties. The author proposes that courts should be cautious in applying a <b>limitations</b> <b>period</b> to the enforcement of RCRA civil penalties. The author further points out the various events and tools which should toll the running of a <b>limitations</b> <b>period</b> if a court should hold that a <b>limitations</b> <b>period</b> does apply to RCRA civil penalty enforcement. Even if the courts do hold that RCRA civil penalties are limited by the general five-year statute of limitations, this will not apply to RCRA 2 ̆ 7 s injunctive relief.

2500|$|The Court {{concluded}} {{by emphasizing}} {{the need for the}} parties to receive fair notice and an opportunity to be heard before a court acts on its own initiative. [...] Courts must also ensure that the petitioner is not significantly prejudiced by the delayed focus on the limitation issue, and [...] "determine whether the interests of justice would be better served" [...] by addressing the merits or by dismissing the petition as time barred. [...] The Court also stated that a district court would not have the discretion to disregard the choice of a defendant to intelligently waive the limitations defense. [...] In this case, however, the Court believed the Magistrate Judge gave Day due notice and a fair opportunity to show why the <b>limitation</b> <b>period</b> should not yield dismissal of the petition, and there was nothing to suggest that the State [...] "strategically" [...] withheld the defense or chose to relinquish it. [...] The record instead indicated that the miscalculation was [...] "merely an inadvertent error." ...|$|E
2500|$|Parliament passed England's first general statute {{limiting}} {{the right to}} recover possession of land in 1623. At common law, if entitlement to possession of land was in dispute (originally only in what were known as real actions), the person claiming a right to possession {{was not allowed to}} allege that the land had come into his possession in the past (in older terminology that he had been [...] "put into seisin") at a time before the reign of Henry I. The law recognized a cutoff date going back into the past, before which date the law would not be interested. There was no requirement for a defendant to show any form of adverse possession. As time went on, the date was moved by statute—first to the reign of Henry II, and then to the reign of Richard I. No further changes were made of this kind. By the reign of Henry VIII the fact that there had been no changes to the cutoff date had become very inconvenient. [...] A new approach was taken whereby the person claiming possession had to show possession of the land for a continuous period, a certain number of years (60, 50 or 30 depending on the kind of claim made) before the date of the claim. Later statutes have shortened the <b>limitation</b> <b>period</b> in most common law jurisdictions.|$|E
2500|$|In JA Pye (Oxford) Ltd v Graham, Mr and Mrs Graham {{had been}} let {{a part of}} Mr Pye's land, and then the lease had expired. Mr Pye refused to renew a lease, {{on the basis that}} this might disturb getting {{planning}} permission. In fact the land remained unused, Mr Pye did nothing, while the Grahams continued to retain a key to the property and used it as part of their farm. At the end of the <b>limitation</b> <b>period,</b> they claimed the land was theirs. They had in fact offered to buy a licence from Mr Pye, but the House of Lords held that this did not amount to an acknowledgement of title that would deprive them of a claim. Having lost in the UK courts, Mr Pye took the case to the European Court of Human Rights, arguing that his business should receive £10 million in compensation because it was a breach of his right under ECHR Protocol 1, article 1 to [...] "peaceful enjoyment of possessions". The Court rejected this, holding that it was within a member state's margin of appreciation to determine the relevant property rules. Otherwise, a significant limit on the principle in the case of leases is that adverse possession actions will only succeed against the leaseholder, and not the freeholder once the lease has expired. However the main limitation remains that the 2002 legislation appears to have emasculated the principle of adverse possession, because the Registrar now effectively informs owners of the steps to be taken to prevent adverse possession.|$|E
