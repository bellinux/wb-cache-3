40|$|The lithium TMP-aluminate bases "LiTMP·Al(iBu) 3 " 1 and "LiTMP·Al(TMP) (iBu) 2 " 2, where TMP is 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidide, have {{recently}} {{come under the}} spotlight as "aluminating" reagents in that they can perform aluminium-hydrogen exchange {{on a wide variety}} of aromatic substrates. Previous studies have intimated that 1 existed as a single species in THF solution formulated as [(THF) ·Li(μ-TMP) (μ-iBu) Al(iBu) 2] 1 ·THF, having a contacted ion pair structure as evidenced by an X-ray crystallographic study of isolated crystals. But here using anisole as a case substrate it is revealed that pre-crystallised 1 ·THF cannot deprotonate anisole at all whether in hexane or THF solution contradicting earlier in situ applications of 1 which revealed near quantitative metallation of anisole. NMR spectroscopic studies of 1 made in situ in THF solution ascribe this reactivity distinction from 1 ·THF to complex equilibria involving five major species in LiTMP·THF, Al(iBu) 3 ·THF, [{Li(THF) 4 } +{Al(TMP) (iBu) 3 }-] 1 ·(THF) 4, [(THF) ·Li(μ-TMP) (μ-OC 4 H 7) Al(iBu) 2], 4, and (TMP) Al(iBu) 2 ·THF.

40|$|This {{research}} {{describes the}} development of a new strategy for discovering novel dopaminergic compounds by utilizing two routes described previously. These routes were to rigidify the elements of the trans-β-dopamine-β-phenyl pharmacophore with methylene linkages and to substitute the elements of this pharmacophore with bioisosteric groups. The new strategy is a hybrid approach where the methylene linkages are replaced with bioisosteric ether linkages. Three series of compounds were designed and synthesized from the full dopamine D 1 agonists dihydrexidine (2) and dinapsoline (3). The syntheses of these compounds involved Suzuki cross-coupling reactions, <b>lithiations,</b> enolate formation, ether syntheses, and isoquinoline syntheses and transformations. The ether bioisostere of dinapsoline that was named dinoxyline (5) was shown to be a full D 1 agonist (EC 50 = 30 nM) with approximately equal affinity for D 1 (Ki = 7 nM) and D 2 (Ki = 6 nM) receptors. Dinoxyline (5) also has high affinity for D 3 (K i = 5 nM) and D 4 (Ki = 43 nM) receptors. A ring-expanded analogue of dinoxyline (8) was synthesized that had little affinity (Ki 3 ̆e 1, 000 nM) for the dopamine receptors tested. This result was surprising because a similar ring expanded analogue of dinapsoline (13) was able to bind to dopamine receptors. The ether analogue of dihydrexidine was named O-dihydrexidine (O-DHX; 9) and had low affinity (Ki 3 ̆e 1, 000 nM) for the dopamine receptors tested. In order to develop further conclusions about these compounds, the N-allyl and N-propyl compounds were synthesized and their affinity for dopamine receptors measured. N-Alkylation did not increase affinity of dinoxyline for D 2 -like receptors as had been previously described for dihydrexidine (2) and dinapsoline (3). In addition, methyl groups were appropriately added to dinoxyline (5) and dinapsoline (3) to mimic the steric bulk of dihydrexidine 2 ̆ 7 s (3) 7, 8 -ethano bridge. These compounds were designed to determine the steric requirements for this region of the D 1 and D 2 receptors. A detailed SAR study of the target compounds is presented. ...|$|R
40|$|There are {{two major}} methods of {{performing}} radical-anion induced reductive <b>lithiations</b> that result in the cleavage of carbon-heteroatom bonds to produce organolithium compounds. The conventional (PAR) method uses a stoichiometric amount of preformed aromatic radical-anion. The newer catalytic aromatic (CA) method is growing rapidly in popularity and has been claimed {{to be far more}} powerful than the PAR method. The CA method uses a large excess of lithium {{in the presence of a}} catalytic quantity of the aromatic compound, usually naphthalene or 4, 4 „S-di-tert-butylbiphenyl. It is revealed here that in a number of cases studied that the CA method is far inferior to the PAR method and that in at least one case the aromatic "catalyst" is not required and that in another the arene is an inhibitor rather than a catalyst. In collaboration with others, a Pd-catalyzed Zn-ene cyclization, using allyl phenyl sulfones instead of allyl acetates as precursors of allylzincs, was developed for the preparation of five-membered rings bearing adjacent cis vinyl and CH 2 ZnEt or CHZnEt groups. This methodology has been used for the total syntheses of the highly physiologically active prostaglandin („b) - 15 -deoxy-ƒ´ 12, 14 -PGJ 2 and (ƒ{) -kainic acid, an alkaloid that is in great demand for medical research. The potent anti-inflammatory agent 15 -deoxy-ƒ´ 12, 14 -PGJ 2, was synthesized using the Zn-ene cyclization onto an alkyne as the key step in 13 linear steps in 7. 7 % overall yield. An important analog, 15 -deoxy- 9, 10 - 2 H-ƒ´ 12, 14 -PGJ 2, has also been synthesized as its precursor. (ƒ{) -Kainic acid, an extremely neuroexcitatory amino acid, was synthesized through highly diastereoselective Zn-ene cyclizations of both allyl sulfone and allyl chloride substrates. The sulfone approach required 10 linear steps from commercially available D-serine methyl ester with an overall yield of 11 %. The chloride strategy required 11 linear steps from the same starting material, but with a much higher overall yield of 48 %, which is by far the highest of any kainic acid synthesis to date and it can be carried out on the largest scale to date. In both case, there is some loss of optical purity in the step, in which an ester is converted to an alkene...|$|R
40|$|Some years ago, we {{reported}} that 3 -phenylsydnone underwent dilithiation to yield the dilithio species, upon treatment with n-butyllithium. Subsequent reactions with electrophiles led to variously substituted aryl sydnones, {{dependent on the}} nature of the electrophile employed. Sydnonimines, exocyclic nitrogen analogs of sydnones, exhibit interesting biological properties and, accordingly, it was of value to explore whether or not the dilithiation approach could be extended to such species. In the present work a series of N- 6 -ethoxycarbonyl- 3 -arylsydnonimines were synthesized from the corresponding sydnonimine hydrochlorides in moderate yields (22 - 77 %). Attempted dilithiations of N- 6 -ethoxycarbonyl- 3 -arylsydnonimines and trapping with iodine proved to be problematic, yielding only the mono substituted (at the 4 -position) iodosydnonimine and not the desired disubstituted sydnonimine in a model study with N- 6 -ethoxycarbonyl- 3 -phenylsydnonimine. The 4 -iodo species was extremely unstable, decomposing to the parent sydnonimine on standing or exposure to moisture, however, by careful chromatography, it was possible to isolate the N- 6 -ethoxycarbonyl- 4 -iodo- 3 -phenylsydnonimine in a very low yield (1. 6 %). Further <b>lithiations</b> with different reagents and substrates led to many unidentified reaction products, none of which appeared to be a sydnonimine. Reactions of N- 6 -ethoxycarbonyl- 3 -arylsydnonimines with brominating agents (potassium bromate and N-bromosuccinimide) showed that the preference was for substitution on the sydnonimine ring (yields of the 4 -bromo congeners ranged from 32 - 90 %). With the latter, it was discovered that removal of the bromine at the 4 -position could be effected cleanly using sodium borohydride. The chlorinating agent potassium chlorate also showed a preference for substitution on the sydnonimine ring, however, other chlorinating agents (N-chlorosuccinimide and (dichloroiodo) benzene) did not effect chlorination on the aryl ring or sydnonimine ring in model studies with N- 6 -ethoxycarbonyl- 3 -phenylsydnonimine. Iodinating agents (iodine monochloride, N-iodosuccinimide) did not react with N- 6 -ethoxycarbonyl- 3 -phenylsydnonimine in model studies. Sonogashira coupling reactions with N- 6 -ethoxycarbonyl- 4 -bromo- 3 -phenylsydnonimine and N- 6 -ethoxycarbonyl- 4 -chloro- 3 -phenylsydnonimine and terminal acetylenes showed that the chlorine at the 4 -position could not be exchanged, and the bromine at the 4 -position was reduced to the parent sydnonimine...|$|R

40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis illustrates how a range of computational methods may be applied to explain, both experimentally observed and computationally predicted, selectivity, {{in the field of}} Organic Chemistry. We begin with a discussion of the theory behind Computational Chemistry and also background to the ever growing field of organocatalysis, followed by a synopsis on the importance of asymmetry in synthesis. The second chapter focusses on an asymmetric organocatalysed reaction for the diastereoselective and enantioselective synthesis of the morphan motif. We look at a range of primary amine organocatalysts in this section, and are able to account for the observed asymmetry that is imparted, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Furthermore, through the course of our investigation, we were able to propose synthetic modifications to an existing organocatalyst used in this reaction, resulting in improvement to the enantioselectivity and atom economy of the reaction. In chapter three, we examine the various factors influencing ring closing reactions for a range of systems and investigate the origin of the underlying preference for cyclisations to follow Baldwinâs rules for selectivity. In order to do this, we use a range of computational techniques, including nucleus independent chemical shift (NICS) analysis {{to gain a better understanding}} of the magnetic properties of ring closing transitions structures (TS). Chapter four contains an in depth look into the stereoelectronic effects altering enantioselectivity in alkylation reactions with bicyclic enamine chiral auxiliaries. In this study, we were able to develop, improve, and implement a new methodology for explaining stereoselective alkylations of tropane-type enamine systems. Our computationally derived predictions of selectivity made for a number of systems have been subsequently verified with experimental results which were within 5 kJ/mol of our values. In chapter five, we use computational analysis to provide insight into the regiodi-vergent Î±- and Î±â-lithiation-electrophile trapping of N-thiopivaloyl- and N-(tert- butoxythiocarbonyl) -Î±-alkylazetidines. We calculated the magnitudes of rotational barriers for a range of protected azetidine systems and showed that rotamer interconversion could not occur for the aforementioned species at the temperature and on the time scale of the <b>lithiations.</b> In the final chapter, we describe the development of computational tools that have been essential in the other investigations discussed in this thesis.
