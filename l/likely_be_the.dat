5|$|On October 5, 1949, Douglas made a radio {{appearance}} announcing her candidacy. She attacked Downey almost continuously {{throughout the}} remainder of the year, accusing him of being a do-nothing, a tool of big business, and an agent of oil interests. She hired Harold Tipton, a newcomer to California who had managed a successful congressional campaign in the Seattle area, as her campaign manager. Douglas realized that Nixon would most <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Republican nominee, and felt that were she to win the primary, the wide gap between Nixon's positions and hers would cause voters to rally to her. Downey, who suffered from a severe ulcer, was initially undecided about running, but announced his candidacy in early December in a speech that included an attack on Douglas. Earl Desmond, a member of the California State Senate from Sacramento whose positions were similar to Downey's, also entered the race.|$|E
5|$|Their {{experiment}} {{showed a}} statistically significant difference in the thickness of the stomach mucosa. The mucosa of rats fed raw or cooked potato modified with the GNA gene was thicker than that of rats fed the unmodified potato. The crypt length in the jejunum was greater on rats fed the raw modified potato, although there was no statistical difference observed in the rats fed the cooked potato. As these effects were not observed in rats fed the control potatoes spiked with GNA, Pusztai concluded that the differences were a result of the transformation procedure, rather than the presence of GNA. Pusztai's collaborator Stanley Ewen said that the cauliflower mosaic virus used as a promoter could <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> cause of the observed changes.|$|E

The landing ellipse also contains a rock type that is very dense, very brightly colored, and unlike any rock type previously investigated on Mars. It may be an ancient playa lake deposit, and it will <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> mission's first target in checking for the presence of organic molecules.|$|E
25|$|The SD70M-2 {{was not a}} big seller, as {{most major}} {{carriers}} were purchasing AC traction locomotives exclusively {{by the time of}} its introduction. Only 331 SD70M-2's were built. Canadian National Railway owns 190 units, and 130 units are owned by Norfolk Southern Railway. 8 units owned by Electro-Motive Diesel and 3 units owned by CIT Financial were leased by Florida East Coast Railway until early 2015. CN 8964, built December 2010 was the last SD70M-2, and will most <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last new DC traction locomotive since holdouts, CN and NS, have embraced the AC traction concept.|$|E

25|$|The {{calculations}} for a nonspherical primary {{are apparently}} {{orders of magnitude}} harder than for a spherical primary. A spherically symmetric simulation is one-dimensional, while an axially symmetric simulation is two dimensional. Simulations typically divide up each dimension into discrete segments, so a one-dimensional simulation might involve only 100 points, while a similarly accurate two dimensional simulation would require 10,000. This would <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> reason they would be desirable for a country like the People's Republic of China, which already developed its own nuclear and thermonuclear weapons, especially since {{they were no longer}} conducting nuclear testing which would provide valuable design information.|$|E
25|$|Football is the most-popular {{sport in}} Benghazi, {{and two of}} Libya's most-successful {{football}} clubs, Al-Ahly Benghazi and Al-Nasr Benghazi, are based in the city. The two teams have won the Libyan Premier League five times; Al Ahly four and Al Nasr only one. The most-important football event {{that took place in}} Benghazi was the 1982 African Cup of Nations. The city hosted six group games and a semifinal in the March 28 Stadium, Libya's second-largest stadium. The city will very <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> scene of more games when Libya re-hosts the African Cup of Nations in 2013.|$|E
25|$|An issue {{likely to}} come into play will be a {{provision}} in the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-134), which places a US$200 million cap on the aggregate of all passengers' damage claims in a railroad accident against a passenger railroad, including punitive damages. Bloomberg News reported that this event would <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first legal test of this law, according to a former House rail committee staffer who helped write the law, who predicted that given the number of casualties, the cap is almost certainly going to be an issue in pending litigation. An attorney representing two of the victims agreed, saying payouts could range from $5 million to $10 million per death or serious injury. Metrolink reportedly has insurance coverage totaling $150 million.|$|E

25|$|On {{the second}} day of the draft the Rams {{selected}} Cornerback Jonathan Wade from Tennessee in the third round. With a 4.4second 40-yard dash, Wade will add some speed at the cornerback position. In the fifth round the Rams selected Center Dustin Fry out of Clemson. With Andy McCollum and Brett Romberg competing for the starting position at Center, Fry will <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> third stringer at that position. Later in the fifth round the Rams selected Defensive Tackle Clifton Ryan from Michigan State. The Rams stated that he will be used as a Nose Tackle. In the sixth round the Rams selected Offensive Tackle Ken Shackleford from Georgia. Coach Linehan commented that he could develop into a starter over the next couple of years. The Rams had two compensatory picks and selected Arkansas Defensive Tackle Keith Jackson, son of former NFL Pro Bowl tight end Keith Jackson, and Wisconsin–Whitewater Wide Receiver Derek Stanley.|$|E
25|$|The No. 3 car was {{initially}} {{run in the}} then-Busch Series by Dale Earnhardt, Inc. beginning in 1989, winning two back-to-back championships with Dale Earnhardt, Jr. in 1998 and 1999. The No. 3 made its debut {{as part of the}} RCR stable in 2002 at the EAS/GNC Live Well 300 at Daytona, driven twice that year by Earnhardt, Jr. with sponsorships from the Nabisco brands Oreo and Nilla. Earnhardt won the Daytona race but finished 36th at the Carquest Auto Parts 300 at Charlotte after being involved in a crash. The No. 3 car returned for one race in 2010 at the Subway Jalapeño 250 at Daytona with a sponsorship from Wrangler, in a joint venture between RCR, JR Motorsports, and Dale Earnhardt, Inc. The car was once again driven by Earnhardt, Jr. with a paint scheme resembling the one used by his late father when he first drove for RCR. Earnhardt would go on to win the race, his first victory in 87 Nationwide Series starts, and the first victory in a Nationwide Car of Tomorrow. Prior to the start, Earnhardt, Jr. claimed that it would most <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last time he would drive the No. 3 car.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that PPIs have {{revolutionized}} the treatment of GERD, there is still room for improvement in the speed of onset of acid suppression as well as mode of action that is independent of an acidic environment and also better inhibition of the proton pump. Therefore, {{a new class of}} PPIs, potassium-competitive acid blockers (P-CABs) or acid pump antagonists (APAs), have been under development the past years and will most <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> next generation of drugs that suppress gastric activity. These new agents can in a reversible and competitive fashion inhibit the final step in the gastric acid secretion with respect to K+ binding to the parietal cell gastric H+/K+ ATPase. That is, they block the action of the H+/K+ ATPase by binding to or near the site of the K+ channel. Since the binding is competitive and reversible these agents have the potential to achieve faster inhibition of acid secretion and longer duration of action compared to PPIs, resulting in quicker symptom relief and healing. The imidazopyridine-based compound SCH28080 was the prototype of this class, and turned out to be hepatotoxic. Newer agents that are currently in development include CS-526, linaprazan, soraprazan and revaprazan in which the latter have reached clinical trials. Studies remain to determine whether these or other related compounds can become useful. In June 2006, Yuhan obtained approval from the Korean FDA for the use of revaprazan (brand name Revanex) in the treatment of gastritis.|$|E

500|$|Immediately {{after the}} Alves fight, Hughes {{stated that he}} had [...] "one more fight" [...] left in him, and {{that he wanted to}} fight Matt Serra. Their rivalry stemmed from the time when Serra was a {{contestant}} on The Ultimate Fighter and Hughes was guest coach. Serra did not like the way Hughes criticized other contestants on the show and was disgusted when Hughes constantly picked on Georges St-Pierre during a lunch break and bragged about his submission victory. On January 9, 2009, Hughes confirmed on his blog that UFC 98 would <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> day he and Serra met in the Octagon. UFC confirmed the fight.|$|E

500|$|Talking {{about the}} album {{version of the}} song, David Amidon of PopMatters praised the new minor {{additions}} featured in the production, musing [...] "from mere sonic details to a litany of background histrionics on guitar that play off of West’s delivery throughout", and compared the production favorably to Late Registration. HipHopDX writer Jake Paine felt {{that one of the}} best moments of the album occurred early on, during [...] "Power" [...] and that track will <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most remembered song [...] "in lyrical circles". Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club called the track a terrific single, declaring that it [...] "soars to adrenaline-fueled heights on the strength of urgent, stomping percussion-driven, serpentine electric guitar, and a show-stopping sample of King Crimson’s [...] "21st Century Schizoid Man", stating that the song best showcases West's vision on the album. BBC's Stephen Kelly called the song [...] "brilliantly pompous".|$|E
500|$|When the 1839 Whig National Convention {{convened in}} Harrisburg, Pennsylvania {{to choose the}} party's ticket, the United States was {{in the third year}} of a serious {{recession}} following the Panic of 1837. President Van Buren's ineffective efforts to deal with the situation cost him public support. [...] With the Democratic Party torn into factions, the head of the Whig ticket would <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> next president. Harrison, Clay, and General Winfield Scott all sought the nomination. Tyler attended the convention and was with the Virginia delegation, although he had no official status. Because of bitterness over the unresolved Senate election, the Virginia delegation refused to make Tyler its favorite son candidate for vice president. Tyler himself did nothing to aid his chances. If his favored candidate for the presidential nomination, Clay, were successful, he would likely not be chosen for the second place on the ticket, which would probably go to a Northerner to assure geographic balance.|$|E
