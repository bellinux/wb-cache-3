Domninus apparently declined the offer, since later correspondence to him from Libanius, between 361 and 364, served as recommendations for law school candidates.|$|E

5|$|Incumbent Republican Senator Scott Brown ran for {{re-election}} to a first full term.

Warren clinched near-unanimous party support, with {{all but one of the}} other Democratic candidates withdrawing following her entrance. After winning her party's nomination, eliminating any need for a primary, she faced Brown in the general election.|$|E

In 1982, Ronald Reagan appointed him as judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.|$|E
5|$|In public, Hand {{discussed}} {{issues of}} democracy, free speech, and toleration only in general terms. This discretion, plus {{a series of}} impressive speaking engagements, won him the respect of legal scholars and journalists, and by 1930 he {{was viewed as a}} serious candidate for a seat on the Supreme Court. His friend Felix Frankfurter, then a Harvard <b>Law</b> <b>School</b> <b>professor,</b> was among those lobbying hard for Hand's appointment. President Herbert Hoover chose to bypass him, possibly for political reasons, and appointed Charles Evans Hughes, who had previously served on the Court for six years before resigning to become the Republican candidate for President in 1916, as Chief Justice. With Hughes and another New Yorker, Harlan Fiske Stone, on the Court, the promotion of a third New Yorker was then seen as impossible.|$|E

5|$|On January 5, 1993, , a bill {{to reduce}} the salary of the Treasury Secretary from $148,400 to $99,500 (the pre-1989 level), passed by a voice vote in the Senate and by the House on January 6. On January 19, President George H.W. Bush signed a bill {{enacting}} a temporary Saxbe fix so that Senator Lloyd Bentsen could move from the Senate {{to take the job}} of Treasury Secretary during the newly elected Clinton administration. S.J. RES. 1 (1993), which canceled emolument increases for the remainder of Bentsen's term, a term set to expire at noon on January 3, 1995, had been passed by both Houses without objection. However, in a law review article, University of Minnesota <b>Law</b> <b>School</b> <b>Professor</b> Michael Stokes Paulson rejected the Bentsen fix as unconstitutional. In 1994, President Bill Clinton received approval to use a Saxbe fix to appoint United States Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell to the Supreme Court, but Mitchell withdrew his name from consideration for reasons unrelated to his eligibility.|$|E

The five law students (George Biondi, John Larouche, Neil Thomas Proto, Kenneth Perlman, and Peter Resselar) who formed Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures (SCRAP) began their journey in December 1971 with the filing of a petition in the ICC that sought a one billion dollar refund for the failure of the Commission to comply with NEPA in approving a 20 percent rate increase (after NEPA's effective date) that SCRAP (and others) claimed discriminated against the movement of recyclable materials by favoring the movement of raw materials. In April and May 1972, SCRAP sued the United States and the ICC in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for violating NEPA in approving the 20% increase (already being collected) and a new 2.5% rate increase on all freight transported by all of the nation's railroads. SCRAP then sought a preliminary injunction and a temporary injunction prior to the effective date of the 2.5% rate increase.|$|E
