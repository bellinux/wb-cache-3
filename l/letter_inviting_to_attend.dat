40|$|Introduction: In {{order to}} set a {{regional}} research agenda, an interactive research workshop was planned by the joint University of Queensland and University of Southern Quennsland Centre for Rural and Remote Area Health (CRRAH), in which researchers and regional organisations would meet together to discuss and prioritise local research needs, then formulate constructive ideas and activities. Methods: Selection of Participants: Organisations representing all key consumer, academic and health professionals within the Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia region were sent a <b>letter</b> <b>inviting</b> them <b>to</b> <b>attend</b> and <b>to</b> send at least one representative, {{resulting in a total}} of 75 workshop participants from 45 organisations representing 20 separate entities. The Design of the Workshop: The workshop was planned as an interactive research workshop, with a preliminary brainstorming to identify and prioritise topics, followed by facilitated small group discussions, and finally presentations to the reassembled total group. Results: Forty three topics were put forward by participants during the plenary session, in which the following 12 major themes were evident: (1) health professional development and support; (2) mechanisms for identifying regional/local needs; (3) mental health; (4) health and interaction with the environment; (5) management of common conditions of which little is known; (6) post acute/aged care; (7) evidence based practice; (8) health workforce including volunteers; (9) indigenous health; (10) access to health service delivery; (11) economic impact of new programs; and (12) outcomes impact of research partnerships. Five subject areas from four of these themes were chosen for further small group discussion. A summary of the views, ideas and conclusions of each group, which were presented to a plenary session of reassembled participants over a 10 - 15 minute period by each group facilitators, are discussed below. Following each presentation, a 5 - 10 minute question session was provided after each topic. Conclusion: A workshop, enabling rural and remote organisations and regional researchers to meet and identify local research needs attracted strong local support. Although the final benefits of the workshop remain to be determined, a number of new collaborative research avenues are now being actively explored within the region, by a number of the participants...|$|R
40|$|AIMS AND BACKGROUND: It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that breast cancer screening induces a 30 % reduction of specific mortality. In May 1990, we started a pilot screening program to assess the feasibility of carrying out such a program in Campania (southern Italy). Herein we report {{the results of the}} first round of the program from three municipalities (Giugliano, Mugnano and Qualiano) that lie within the local health district no. 23, close to the city of Naples. METHODS: Women between the ages of 50 and 69 years were sent a personalized <b>letter</b> <b>inviting</b> them <b>to</b> <b>attend</b> the screening test; those not responding were sent a second invitation. The screening test consisted of clinical examination followed by two-view mammography. Second-level diagnostic tools were sonography, fine needle aspiration (manual, echo-guided and stereotaxic) and surgical biopsy. RESULTS: Out of 5, 732 women invited for the first round, 1, 813 (31. 6 %) attended the screening. Attendance rate was higher among younger women. Ninety-one women were positive at the screening test and underwent further examination (recall rate, 5. 0 %). Among them, 19 had surgical biopsy (biopsy rate, 1. 0 %) that led to breast cancer diagnosis in 11 cases. The benign/malignant biopsy rate was 0. 73. Detection rate was 6. 07 x 1, 000 screened women and varied among age categories, increasing within the 60 - 69 subgroup; detection rate/expected incidence ratio in the overall group was 4. 5 and also increased within the older age category. Seven out of 11 cancers were at UICC stage O-I. Among 327 self-referring women, 38 were positive (recall rate, 11. 6 %), and 14 underwent biopsy (biopsy rate, 4. 3 %), which showed cancer in 7 cases (benign/malignant biopsy rate, 1. 0). In addition, 2 inflammatory cancers were diagnosed without surgical biopsy. Thus 9 cancer cases were detected in this group. Self-referring women differed from responding women in that they had a higher frequency of symptoms or familiar history of cancer, and a higher educational level and awareness of preventive medicine. Clinical examination added no diagnostic advantage in the responding group but did not significantly worsen the recall rate. In the self-referring group, one case of inflammatory cancer was missed by mammography and diagnosed by clinical examination. CONCLUSION: The early results (recall rate = 5 %, detection rate/expected incidence ratio = 4. 5, benign/malignant biopsy rate = 0. 73, advanced cancers = 36. 4 %) are encouraging and indicate the validity of the program. Strategies to improve attendance rate are planned...|$|R
40|$|In many Sub-Saharan African {{settings}} male partner {{involvement in}} antenatal care (ANC) remains low, although great benefits for maternal and infant health outcomes have been long recognised, {{in particular regarding}} the prevention of HIV transmission. Yet there is paucity on evidence regarding the effectiveness of strategies to increase male partner involvement. This controlled intervention trial in Ruanda Health Centre in Mbeya, Tanzania, assessed the effectiveness of invitation letters for male involvement in ANC. Pregnant women approaching ANC without partners received official <b>letters</b> <b>inviting</b> the partner <b>to</b> <b>attend</b> ANC. A control group was instructed to verbally invite partners. Partner attendance was recorded at two subsequent ANC visits. Rates for male partner return, couple voluntary counselling and testing (CVCT), and influencing factors were analysed. From 199 ANC clients in total, 97 {{were assigned to the}} invitation letter group; 30 of these (30. 9 %) returned with their male partners for ANC. In the control group of 102 women, 28 (27. 5 %) returned with their partner. In both groups CVCT rates among jointly returning couples were 100 %. Partner return/CVCT rate was not statistically different in intervention and control group (OR 1. 2, p = 0. 59). Former partner attendance at ANC during a previous pregnancy was the only factor found to be significantly linked with partner return (p = 0. 03). Our study demonstrates that rather simple measures to increase male partner attendance in ANC and CVCT can be effective, with written and verbal invitations having comparable outcomes. In terms of practicability in Sub-Saharan African settings, we recommend systematic coaching of ANC clients on how to verbally invite male partners in the first instance, followed by written invitation letters for partners in case of their non-attendance. Further studies covering both urban and rural settings will be more informative for effective translation into policy...|$|R
40|$|The {{benefits}} of male partner involvement in antenatal care (ANC) {{and prevention of}} mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) for maternal and infant health outcomes have been well recognised. However, in many sub-Saharan African settings, male involvement in these services remains low. Previous research has suggested written invitation letters {{as a way to}} promote male partner involvement. In this implementation study conducted at three study sites in southwest Tanzania, acceptability of written invitation letters for male partners was assessed. Pre-study CVCT rates of 2 - 19 % had been recorded at the study sites. Pregnant women approaching ANC without a male partner were given an official <b>letter,</b> <b>inviting</b> the partner <b>to</b> <b>attend</b> a joint ANC and couple voluntary counselling and testing (CVCT) session. Partner attendance was recorded at subsequent antenatal visits, and the invitation was repeated if the partner did not attend. Analysis of socio-demographic indices associated with male partner attendance at ANC was also performed. Out of 318 women who received an invitation letter for their partner, 53. 5 % returned with their partners for a joint ANC session; of these, 81 % proceeded to CVCT. Self-reported HIV-positive status at baseline was negatively associated with partner return (p[*]=[*] 0. 033). Male attendance varied significantly between the rural and urban study sites (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) with rates as high as 76 % at the rural site compared to 31 % at the urban health centre. The majority of women assessed the joint ANC session as a favourable experience, however 7 (75 %) of women in HIV-positive discordant or concordant relationships reported problems during mutual disclosure. Beneficial outcomes reported one month after the session included improved client- provider relationship, improved intra-couple communication and enhanced sexual and reproductive health decision-making. Official invitation letters are a feasible intervention in a resource limited sub-Saharan African context, they are highly accepted by couple members, and are an effective way to encourage men <b>to</b> <b>attend</b> ANC and CVCT. Pre-intervention CVCT rates were improved in all sites. However, urban settings might require extra emphasis to reach high rates of partner attendance compared to smaller rural health centres...|$|R
