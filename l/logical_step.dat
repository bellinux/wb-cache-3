5|$|Bernard Lovell {{built the}} Transit Telescope at Jodrell Bank {{in the late}} 1940s. This was a -diameter radio {{telescope}} that could only point directly upwards; the next <b>logical</b> <b>step</b> was to build a telescope that could look at {{all parts of the}} sky so that more sources could be observed, as well as for longer integration times. Although the Transit Telescope had been designed and constructed by the astronomers that used it, a fully steerable telescope would need to be professionally designed and constructed; the first challenge was to find an engineer willing to do the job. This turned out to be Charles Husband, whom Lovell first met on 8 September 1949.|$|E

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of Distributed Constraints satisfaction algorithms must {{be measured by}} concurrent performance measures. In Previous studies we have proposed the count of non concurrent <b>logical</b> <b>steps</b> as an asynchronous measure. This measure is independent of the specific implementation and is not affected by the level of concurrency of the performing algorithm. The method of counting non-concurrent constraints-checks (NCCCs) was later extended {{to the case of}} systems with message delays. The method inherently assumes that each message received by an agent triggers some computation. In some DisCSP algorithms, such as AW C and ABT DO, agents receive assignment messages from lower priority agents which do not cause a computation. The present paper proposes a generalization of the method of counting non-concurrent <b>logical</b> <b>steps</b> as run-time measure for distributed search algorithms. Logical time counters carried by messages do not immediately update the receiving agent’s logical counter. Instead, the agent stores the data carried by the message and tags it with the logical time carried by the message. Only when the agent uses the stored information for the first time, the logical counter of the delivering message is considered. The proposed method ensures that the reported solution does not include <b>logical</b> computation <b>steps</b> that could have been performed concurrently. The proposed general method is presented in detail, demonstrated on the relevant DisCSP algorithms and its correctness is proven...|$|R

25|$|Also labeled an Orphist by Apollinaire, Marcel Duchamp was {{responsible}} for another extreme development inspired by Cubism. The ready-made arose from a joint consideration that the work itself is considered an object (just as a painting), and that it uses the material detritus of the world (as collage and papier collé in the Cubist construction and Assemblage). The next <b>logical</b> <b>step,</b> for Duchamp, was to present an ordinary object as a self-sufficient work of art representing only itself. In 1913 he attached a bicycle wheel to a kitchen stool and in 1914 selected a bottle-drying rack as a sculpture in its own right.|$|E

50|$|Forge is a mutant with a superhuman {{intuitive}} {{talent for}} inventing mechanical devices, {{backed up by}} the ability to visually perceive mechanical energy in action. This power allows him to instinctively recognize the potential and functional uses of any machine or technological device in his visual range, a skill that combined with his natural intelligence gives him the ability to conceive, design and build highly advanced mechanical devices; and operate, modify and disassemble existing technology or create countermeasures for it. Forge's superhuman talent for invention {{does not mean that}} he is of a superhuman intellect, even a genius at invention must for the most part consciously work out the theoretical principles behind the invention and then the design of the invention itself through a series of <b>logical</b> <b>steps.</b> In Forge's case, however, many of these <b>logical</b> <b>steps</b> are worked out by his subconscious mind. Hence, Forge himself might not be entirely aware of exactly how he figured out how to create an invention of his. Sometimes, he must disassemble a device he has made to even figure out how it works.|$|R

25|$|Thus, the AMC Eagle {{came about}} when Jeep's chief {{engineer}} joined a Concord {{body with a}} four-wheel-drive system. Such a vehicle was a <b>logical</b> <b>step</b> for AMC, according to then CEO Gerald C. Meyers, as a second energy crisis had hit in 1979, and sales of AMC's highly profitable truck-based Jeep line dropped, {{due in part to}} their low fuel efficiency, leaving AMC in a precarious financial position. The Eagle provided a low-cost way of bridging the gap between AMC's solid and economical, but aging, passenger car line and its well-regarded, but decidedly off-road-focused, Jeep line, as the Eagle used the existing Concord (and later, Spirit) automobile platform.|$|E

Within {{a few days of}} the Allied landings on Sicily in July 1943, it was obvious Mussolini's army was on the brink of collapse. This led Hitler to summon Mussolini to a meeting in Feltre on 19 July 1943. By this time, Mussolini was so shaken from stress that he could no longer stand Hitler's boasting. His mood darkened further when that same day, the Allies bombed Rome—the first time that city had ever been the target of enemy bombing.|$|E

25|$|Although these {{bandages}} were {{an improvement}} over Larrey’s method, they were far from ideal. They required {{a long time to}} apply and dry and there was often shrinkage and distortion. A great deal of interest had been aroused in Europe around 1800 by a British diplomat, consul William Eton, who described a method of treating fractures that he had observed in Turkey. He noted that gypsum plaster (plaster of Paris) was moulded around the patient’s leg to cause immobilization. If the cast became loose due to atrophy or a reduction in swelling, then additional gypsum plaster was added to fill the space. Adapting the use of plaster of Paris for use in hospitals, however, took some time. In 1828, doctors in Berlin were treating leg fractures by aligning the bones in a long narrow box which was then filled with moist sand. The substitution of plaster of Paris for the sand was the next <b>logical</b> <b>step.</b> Such plaster casts did not succeed however as the patient was confined to bed due to the casts being heavy and cumbersome.|$|E

So the <b>logical</b> <b>step</b> would be to take on those investment programmes which compliment the existing imbalance in the economy. Clearly, such an investment cannot be a balanced one. If an economy makes the mistake of setting {{out to make a}} balanced investment, a new imbalance is likely to appear which will require still another [...] "balancing investment" [...] to bring equilibrium, {{and so on and so}} forth.|$|E

500|$|During {{the winter}} of 1918–19, Zangezur was {{isolated}} from Karabakh and Yerevan by snow. The refugees intensified the famine and epidemic conditions and gave way to inflation. In December 1918, Andranik withdrew from Karabakh to Goris. On his way, he met with British officers who suggested the Armenian units stay in Zangezur for the winter. Andranik agreed to such a proposal and on 23 December 1918, a group of Armenian leaders met in a conference and concluded that Zangezur could not cope with the influx of refugees until spring. They agreed that the first <b>logical</b> <b>step</b> in relieving the tension was the reparation of [...] more than 15,000 refugees from Nakhichevanthe adjoining district that had been evacuated by the Ottoman armies.
