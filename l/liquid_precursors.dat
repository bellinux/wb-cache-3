Those properties make hyperspectral imaging a well suited technique for the mining industry. Taking advantage of the specific spectral signature of minerals Photonic Knowledge's Core Mapper™ offers instant mineral identification. This technology delivers monochromatic images and fast mineralogy mapping. The widefield modality renders possible the identification of minerals signatures but also the classification of plants (e.g.: weed, precision agriculture) and food (e.g.: meat freshness, fruit defects) and can be use for diverse outdoor applications. Being able to quickly and efficiently detect explosive <b>liquid</b> <b>precursors</b> represents an important asset to identify potential threats. Hyperspectral camera in the SWIR region allows such detection by acquiring rapidly spectrally resolved images.

40|$|Chemical {{crosslinking}} of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) <b>liquid</b> <b>precursors</b> has {{the ability}} to support variable acid loading and create intricate structures that are highly effective in suppressing methanol crossover while maintaining reasonable conductivity in PEMs for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). PEM fabrication from photocuring of <b>liquid</b> <b>precursors</b> is another advantage over traditional methods of melt-processing and solvent-casting in which high cost and sophisticated equipment are employed.
