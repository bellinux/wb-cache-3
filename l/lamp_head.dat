50|$|The {{asymmetric}} {{task light}} {{is intended to}} be placed {{at the side of the}} actual task. The luminaire directs the light obliquely over the desk, with the highest illuminance typically about 1' to 1½' to the side of the <b>lamp</b> <b>head.</b> It mostly has an arm system that holds the <b>lamp</b> <b>head</b> horizontally irrespective of the arm movement - a parallel arm. Asymmetric lamps often cause more reflected glare than other lamps. In workplaces where people use different table heights, an asymmetric lamp may cause direct glare due to its absence of means for glare control (ref:1).|$|E

50|$|The AE82 Sprinter sedan had {{slightly}} different <b>head</b> <b>lamps</b> {{compared to the}} AE82 Corolla, 4 side windows, inclined c-pillar, different tail lamps the boot was placed a little higher and front aero grills were like the AE86 Levin. It had an overall similarity with the AE86 Levin coupe. The RWD Sprinter came with pop-up <b>head</b> <b>lamps</b> (the Corolla had fixed <b>head</b> <b>lamps)</b> and the front bumper was raised a little to accommodate them. The US Corolla GTS shared the <b>head</b> <b>lamps</b> with the Japanese market AE86 Sprinter but with small differences such as lower lift height and US globe fittings. The Sprinter sold in Australia was actually identical to a Japanese market Corolla {{in all of its}} specifications (e.g. no pop-up <b>head</b> <b>lamps,</b> Japanese market tail lamps).|$|R
50|$|Silver {{lenticular}} (vertically ridged) screens, {{which are}} made from a tightly woven fabric, either natural, such as silk, or a synthetic fiber, were excellent for use with low-power projector <b>lamp</b> <b>heads</b> and the monochromatic images that were a staple of early projected images. Other silver screens are made by taking normal matte sheets and adhering silver dust to them; the effect is the same.|$|R
50|$|The 50 W lamp & {{reflector}} is {{a convenient}} size {{and is available}} {{in a variety of}} beam-widths, but the idea of the dichroic reflector preventing heat being reflected forward is actually a disadvantage for the MineCam. The <b>lamp</b> <b>head</b> has to be enclosed to protect it and to screen the power supply interference, but without careful internal design of reflectors and baffles, the housing can get very hot.|$|E

50|$|True silver screens, however, provide {{narrower}} horizontal/vertical viewing angles {{compared to}} their more modern counterparts because of their inability to completely disperse light. In addition, a single projection source tends to over-saturate {{the center of the}} screen and leave the peripheries darker, depending on the position of the viewer and how well adjusted the <b>lamp</b> <b>head</b> is, a phenomenon known as hot-spotting. Due to these limitations and the continued innovation of screen materials, the use of silver screens in the general motion picture exhibition industry has mostly been phased out.|$|E
5000|$|Thomas Edison {{developed}} electric cap lamps for miners {{starting in}} 1914; by 1915, certain cap lamps {{were approved by}} the United States Bureau of Mines for safe use in gassy coal mines. These included features such as spring-loaded contacts to automatically disconnect broken bulbs. These lamps consisted of a reflector and incandescent lamp and a separate belt-mounted wet-cell storage battery. The battery was sized to power the lamp for the entire working shift. After 12 hours a 1917-era miner's lamp produced less than one candlepower and about 2 to 5 total lumens. [...] This pattern became popular for similar <b>lamps.</b> <b>Head</b> <b>lamps</b> approved for use in coal mines are designed not to allow an internal spark to ignite flammable gas surrounding the headlamp.|$|R

50|$|HMI lamps {{can reach}} {{ignition}} voltages {{of up to}} 70,000 V when striking hot, and are considered very dangerous if miswired. It is good practice to strike {{the light from the}} ballast and not the head, in the event that there is a short circuit in the <b>lamp</b> <b>head.</b> Proper striking procedures should be followed as well, such as calling out a vocal warning whenever a light is turned on to warn persons in the area. Also, the header cable should be properly and securely connected. Nearly all present-day header cables are equipped with 'twist-lock' fittings at either end to ensure a safe and precise connection, both at the ballast and the lamp housing.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to these concerns, HMI lamps {{have been known to}} explode violently {{at the end of their}} lifetime or if stressed enough. While not as violent as the explosion of a xenon short-arc bulb, they still require caution. As a result, HMI lamps should not be used past half their rated lifetime, and care should be taken with larger lamps when striking (turning on the lamp), as a lamp is most likely to explode within the first five minutes of striking. For this reason, each HMI lamp will usually carry with it a detailed log of the number of strikes and number of hours it has been used. Care should also be taken transporting the lamp and replacing lamps. The gases in an HMI lamp are under pressure, which increases with temperature. Dropping the lamp could result in an explosion, sending hot quartz glass flying. As with quartz-halogen bulbs, care should be taken not to touch the glass directly as skin oils left behind on the glass can actually heat up past the working temperature of the glass and cause bubbling and/or a weak point on the bulb. For this reason, anytime a bulb is handled it should be cleaned with an isopropyl alcohol wipe. Most lamp housing designs are inherently tougher and thicker than traditional tungsten units so that in the event of a bulb explosion, those nearby are protected from flying debris. There is the possibility of the front lens element on the <b>lamp</b> <b>head</b> cracking from thermal shock (though not completely blowing out or shattering). Proper safety procedures should always be followed when using HMI units, as they can be quite dangerous if misused.|$|E

Used for fast-transient heat-transfer testing, durability testing, and calibration of heat-flux gauges. Calibrations performed at constant or transient heat fluxes ranging from 1 to 6 MW/m 2 and at temperatures ranging from 80 K to melting temperatures of most materials. Facility developed because there is need to build and calibrate very-small heat-flux gauges for Space Shuttle main engine (SSME). Includes <b>lamp</b> <b>head</b> attached to side of service module, an argon-gas-recirculation module, reflector, heat exchanger, and high-speed positioning system.

The incorporated lamp failure detection circuitry enhances the features of the design by activating a feedback signal to indicate lamp failures.

30|$|In {{the case}} of {{automotive}} <b>head</b> <b>lamp,</b> the optical design is to project the lights into a plane at a distance at 25 m {{as described in the}} regulation. In order to have function of anti-glare to the people on the road way, a cut-off line with high contrast is required. To meet the regulation of the low beam, optical loss outside the target region could reach 40 % and higher in most cases, depending on the <b>head</b> <b>lamp</b> size. Therefore, OUF of 60 % is regarded as a high standard. To achieve higher luminous efficacy, CRI around 60 could be adopted.|$|R
