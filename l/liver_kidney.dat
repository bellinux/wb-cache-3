25|$|Autoimmune {{hepatitis}} is {{a chronic}} disease {{caused by an}} abnormal immune response against liver cells. The disease {{is thought to have}} a genetic predisposition as it is associated with certain human leukocyte antigens involved in the immune response. As in other autoimmune diseases, circulating auto-antibodies may be present and are helpful in diagnosis. Auto-antibodies found in patients with autoimmune hepatitis include the sensitive but less specific anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), smooth muscle antibody (SMA), and atypical perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (p-ANCA). Other autoantibodies that are less common but more specific to autoimmune hepatitis are the antibodies against <b>liver</b> <b>kidney</b> microsome 1 (LKM1) and soluble liver antigen (SLA). Autoimmune hepatitis can also be triggered by drugs (such as nitrofurantoin, hydralazine, and methyldopa), after liver transplant, or by viruses (such as hepatitis A, Epstein-Barr virus, or measles).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{function}} of lipid peroxidation and the antiperoxidative enzymes of rat <b>liver</b> and <b>kidney</b> were studied in stone formation induced by intraperitoneal administration of sodium oxalate (7 mg/ 100 g body weight).

A significantly pronounced release of malondialdehyde was observed in treated <b>liver</b> and <b>kidney</b> homogenates when incubated with either ferrous sulphate or hydrogen peroxide compared to control <b>liver</b> and <b>kidney.</b> Superoxide dismutase activity was increased only in liver and not in kidney in treated animals compared to the control.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of Chromium (Cr) residue in <b>liver</b> and <b>kidney</b> samples of cattle was determined at cattle slaughter section of Sokoto Central abattoir Sokoto State Nigeria. A total {{of one hundred}} {{of each of the}} <b>liver</b> and <b>kidney</b> samples were collected and processed for the detection of Chromium using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. All the samples (<b>liver</b> and <b>kidney)</b> were 100 % positive for Chromium. The highest and lowest concentration of Chromium in <b>liver</b> and <b>kidney</b> were found to be among the age groups of ≥ 9 years and those at 0 - 2 years respectively. There was no significant difference (P> 0. 05) in the concentration of Chromium in <b>liver</b> and <b>kidney</b> samples of the different age groups of the slaughtered cattle. The concentration of Chromium in all the samples are within the permissible level recommended by Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) and World Health Organisation(WHO). It is therefore obvious that the <b>liver</b> and <b>kidney</b> of cattle slaughtered at Sokoto abattoir contain Chromium residue. This study was carried out to determine the level of Chromium residue in <b>liver</b> and <b>kidneys</b> of beef consumed from Sokoto Central abattoir Sokoto State, Nigeria. </p...|$|R
25|$|The {{pattern of}} injury, {{evaluation}} and treatment will {{vary with the}} mechanism of the injury. Blunt trauma causes injury via a shock effect; delivering energy over an area. Wounds are often not straight and unbroken skin may hide significant injury. Penetrating trauma follows {{the course of the}} injurious device. As the energy is applied in a more focused fashion, it requires less energy to cause significant injury. Any body organ, including bone and brain, can be injured and bleed. Bleeding may not be readily apparent; internal organs such as the <b>liver,</b> <b>kidney</b> and spleen may bleed into the abdominal cavity. The only apparent signs may come with blood loss. Bleeding from a bodily orifice, such as the rectum, nose, or ears may signal internal bleeding, but cannot be relied upon. Bleeding from a medical procedure also falls into this category.|$|E
25|$|The {{ecosystems}} of the Aral Sea and {{the river}} deltas feeding into it have been nearly destroyed, not least because of the much higher salinity. The receding sea has left huge plains covered with salt and toxic chemicals resulting from weapons testing, industrial projects, and pesticides and fertilizer runoff. These substances form wind-borne toxic dust that spreads throughout the region. As a result, the land around the Aral Sea is heavily polluted, and {{the people living in}} the area are suffering from a lack of fresh water and health problems, including high rates of certain forms of cancer and lung diseases. Respiratory illnesses, including tuberculosis (most of which is drug resistant) and cancer, digestive disorders, anaemia, and infectious diseases are common ailments in the region. <b>Liver,</b> <b>kidney,</b> and eye problems can also be attributed to the toxic dust storms. All of this has resulted in an unusually high fatality rate among vulnerable parts of the population: the child mortality rate is 75 in every 1,000 newborns, and maternity death is 12 in every 1,000 women. The dust storms also contribute to water shortages through salt deposition, which has accelerated glacial melting to as much as 12 times the normal rate. The overuse of pesticides on crops to preserve yields has made this worse, with pesticide use far beyond health limits. Crops in the region are destroyed by salt being deposited onto the land, and fields are being flushed with water at least four times per day to try to remove the salinity from the soils. The dust storms make regional winters colder, and summers hotter.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE. To {{describe}} {{the experience with}} combined <b>liver</b> and <b>kidney</b> transplantation at the University Medical Centre Groningen, The Netherlands. DESIGN. Retrospective. Data were analysed from all patients who underwent combined <b>liver</b> and <b>kidney</b> transplantation in the University Medical Centre Groningen, in the period November 1994 -December 2005. During the study period 582 orthotopic liver transplantations and 1026 isolated kidney transplantations were performed. 16 patients underwent combined <b>liver</b> and <b>kidney</b> transplantation: 4 were children (aged 17 months- 16 years) and 12 were adults (aged 19 - 59 years). For all patients, both organs {{were obtained from the}} same post-mortem donor. Indications for combined <b>liver</b> and <b>kidney</b> transplantation were primary hyperoxaluria type I (n= 6), polycystic <b>liver</b> and <b>kidney</b> disease (n= 3) and unrelated <b>liver</b> and <b>kidney</b> failure (n= 7). The 1 - and 5 -year survival rate was 88 % (14 / 16), which was not significantly different from the results after isolated liver transplantation. Two patients died 11 days and 74 months after combined transplantation, due to complications from unsuccessful retransplantation of the liver for hepatic artery thrombosis and secondary biliary cirrhosis, respectively. A third patient died 51 days after combined transplantation due to sepsis. Combined <b>liver</b> and <b>kidney</b> transplantation was a life-saving intervention in this selected group of patients with combined <b>liver</b> and <b>kidney</b> failure.

30|$|The {{mechanism}} by which carbon tetrachloride causes <b>liver</b> and <b>kidney</b> damage is free radical mediated. In this study, carbon tetrachloride decreased the activities of <b>liver</b> and <b>kidney</b> SOD and catalase. On the other hand, Dennettia tripetala caused an increase in <b>liver</b> and <b>kidney</b> SOD and catalase activities, indicating that {{one way in which}} this plant confers protection is by altering the activity of antioxidant enzymes. Further evidence in support of the antioxidant mechanism is seen in the reduction in malondialdehyde levels of the <b>liver</b> and <b>kidney</b> compared to that of the group administered with only carbon tetrachloride. Products of lipid peroxidation such as malondialdehyde, can inactivate many crucial cellular proteins [37]. Our results show that Dennettia tripetala extract was able to manage carbon tetrachloride-induced lipid peroxidation in the <b>liver</b> and <b>kidney.</b>|$|R
