40|$|Two {{alternative}} estimators {{of individual}} tree leaf area (A 1) area {{are used to}} derive estimates of <b>leaf-area</b> <b>index</b> (L) for 40 plots in Pinus contorta Dougl. stands. One estimator of A 1 {{is based on the}} common assumption of a constant ratio between A 1 and sapwood cross-sectional area at breast height (As). The second estimator of A 1 accounts for tree-to-tree variation in the relation between A 1 and As. The apparent relationship between stand growth and <b>leaf-area</b> <b>index</b> is strongly dependent on the way leaf area is estimated. When L is derived from a constant A 1 ratioAs ratio, stand growth appears to be strongly correlated with L. However, when L is based on estmates of A 1 that account for tree-to-tree variation in the A 1 — As relation, stand growth is seen to be only weakly related to L. Stand structure, quantified as percent live-crown, accounts for {{a great deal of the}} observed variation in leaf-area efficiency. These contrasting relationships illustrate the importance of unbiased estimates of L in interpreting the link between stand-level processes and leaf area...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of yield in cassava, either as a sole crop or intercropped with quick-maturing soybean sown 1, 5 or 9 weeks after cassava planting, or a succession of two soybean sowings 1 and 14 weeks after planting, was followed at a high latitude (27 °S) where the cassava growing season is limited to 9 months by winter temperatures. Competition, at least largely for nitrogen, restricted the growth of cassava, but after soybean harvest, <b>leaf-area</b> <b>index</b> increased such {{that there was little}} difference in interception of radiation among crops, and consequently growth rates and thus amounts of assimilate potentially available for tuber growth were similar. Competition from earlier-sown soybean greatly reduced branching by cassava. The reduced number of branches were sufficient to provide adequate <b>leaf-area</b> <b>index,</b> but were a reduced sink for assimilates during the main period of tuber growth. The slightly reduced assimilate supply available in early intercropped cassava was offset by the increased partitioning to tubers. As a result, soybean intercropping did not reduce tuber yield, except slightly in the case of double-intercropped cassava, but provided an additional yield of grain. Land equivalent ratio was particularly high at about 1. 6 when soybean was sown within 5 weeks of cassava planting. When soybean was sown 9 weeks after cassava planting, land equivalent ratio was reduced to about 1. 3 as a result of lower soybean yield...|$|E

La Grande Tsa at 2336 m a. s. l. is probably the highest bog in the central Swiss Alps and is unique in its pattern. In two of five pools there is in the contact zone between the basal peat and the overlying gyttja an unconformity in the depth-age models based on radiocarbon dates. Palynostratigraphies of cores from a ridge and a pool confirm the occurrence of an unconformity in the contact zone. We conclude that deepening of the pools results from decomposition of peat. The fact that the dated unconformities in the two pools and the unconformity in the ridge-core all fall within the Bronze Age suggest they were caused by events external to the bog.

40|$|ABSTRACT / Although many {{forests are}} {{actively}} sequestering carbon, {{little research has}} examined the direct effects of forest management practices on carbon sequestration. At the Howland Forest in Maine, USA, we are using eddy covariance and biomet-ric techniques to evaluate changes in carbon storage following a shelterwood cut that removed just under 30 % of aboveground biomass. Prior to harvest, the stand contained about 76 Mg C/ha (30 m 2 /ha basal area) in aboveground and belowground live bio-mass. Harvesting removed about 15 Mg C/ha (SEM 2. 1) and created about 5. 3 Mg C/ha (SEM 1. 1) of aboveground and 5. 2 Mg C/ha (SEM 0. 7) of root/stump detritus. <b>Leaf-area</b> <b>index</b> (LAI) and litterfall declined by about 40 % with harvest.

40|$|The {{monitoring}} of pasture status often {{has relied on}} the satellite-derived quantity known as the normalised dierence vegetation index (NDVI). However, theoretical modelling of canopy reflectances by Sellers (1985) suggests that NDVI {{does not provide a}} good measure of green matter quantity, particularly when the <b>leaf-area</b> <b>index</b> (LAI) is large. For ryegrass/clover pastures in the Waikato region of New Zealand, LAI rarely drops below 2, and can range as high as 12. In-situ radiometric measurements of Waikato pastures have conrmed that NDVI is not very sensitive to vegetation bulk amount (total dry matter per hectare). We have found that a better indicator of bulk amount can be obtained by taking a linear combination of reflectances in three bands: green, red, and NIR (near infrared). We investigate these observations using a theoretical model of visible and NIR reflectance from a layered vegetation canopy. This work is an adaptation of the two-stream approach of Dickinson (1983) and Sellers (1985). Assuming isotropic scattering by the leaves, we derive albedos for the green, red, and NIR bands.

40|$|An {{improved}} {{understanding of}} crop stress from multiple pests {{is needed for}} better implementation of integrated pest management (IPM) strategies. Field studies were conducted in 2003 and 2004 at two locations in eastern Nebraska to describe the effects of simulated early-season insect defoliation of soybean and duration of weed interference on soybean growth. Three levels of simulated defoliation (undefoliated, 30, and 60 %) and seven durations of weed interference (weedy and weed free; weed removal at V 2, V 4, V 6, R 3, and R 5) were evaluated in a split-plot design. Defoliation significantly reduced soybean <b>leaf-area</b> <b>index</b> (LAI), total dry matter (TDM), and crop height in season-long weedy treatments only. Biomass partitioning during vegetative and reproductive growth was affected by both defoliation and weed interference. Increase in soybean relative growth rate (RGR) and biomass production soon after defoliation occurred (e. g., V 5 stage) indicated potential defense mechanism by which soybean is able to adjust its physiology {{in response to the}} loss of leaf area. Weed interference combined with defoliation caused the greatest yield losses up to 97 %.

40|$|Temperate and {{boreal forest}} {{ecosystems}} contain {{a large part}} of the carbon stored on land, in the form of both biomass and soil organic matter. Increasing atmospheric [CO 2], increasing temperature, elevated nitrogen deposition and intensified management will change this C store. Well documented single-factor responses of net primary production are: higher photosynthetic rate (the main [CO 2] response); increasing length of growing season (the main temperature response); and higher <b>leaf-area</b> <b>index</b> (the main N deposition and partly [CO 2] response). Soil organic matter will increase with increasing litter input, although priming may decrease the soil C stock initially, but litter quality effects should be minimal (response to [CO 2], N deposition, and temperature); will decrease because of increasing temperature; and will increase because of retardation of decomposition with N deposition, although the rate of decomposition of high-quality litter can be increased and that of low-quality litter decreased. Single-factor responses can be misleading because of interactions between factors, in particular those between N and other factors, and indirect effects such as increased N availability from temperature-induced decomposition. In the long term the strength of feedbacks, for example the increasing demand for N from increased growth, will dominate over short-term responses to single factors. However, management has considerable potential for controlling the C store...|$|E

We hypothesised that the spatial arrangement of the coexistence of species influences patch-level productivity. To characterise diversity, co-occurrences of species were recorded along oval transects allowing scaling by aggregation between 5 cm and 25 m. Productivity was characterised by field radiometric measurements, calibrated for leaf area and biomass, arranged in a sampling scheme scalable between 20 cm and 50 m. All data were collected along a slight resource gradient in the Stipa-Bouteloua (upland) community of the northern mixed-grass prairie in Grasslands National Park, Saskatchewan.

We further investigate spatial and temporal variations in biomass burning emissions for these species and statically analyze the dependences of fire emissions on drought conditions. The results show that emissions present significant diurnal and seasonal patterns. The month with largest emissions varies greatly in different states, although total emission across CONUS is largest in summer.

40|$|The <b>leaf-area</b> <b>index</b> (LAI) {{is a key}} {{parameter}} {{for coupling}} earth-observation data with crop-growth models {{from the perspective of}} crop-yield forecasting. Remote sensing is of particular interest in estimating LAI over large areas. SAR data, thanks to their systematic acquisition, offer an ideal temporal resolution throughout the crop-growing season. Nevertheless, surface soil dielectric permittivity, which is strongly correlated with soil moisture, also affects the SAR signal. Thus, surface-soil permittivity or moisture has to be taken into account. This study tackles the issues related to soil influence on the SAR signal in monitoring maize crop growth. Different methods of assessing surface-soil moisture or permittivity are explored in order to retrieve LAI values from SAR data. The first method is based on a hydrological model * the soil, water, atmosphere, and plant (SWAP) model * with which the surface-soil moisture level can be estimated as a function of time. This method is tested with two kinds of meteorological data as inputs for the hydrological model: ground meteorological data and estimated meteorological data. The second method resorts to ground-penetrating radar, an alternative means of estimating surface-soil permittivity. This study demonstrates that both soil-moisture levels estimated by the SWAP model and soil permittivity measured by ground-penetrating radar can be successfully used for retrieving maize LAI values from SAR data using the water cloud model...|$|E

We also assessed whether {{the source and}} composition of stream DOM was influenced by clearfell forest harvesting (1 – 19 y after harvest). Stream DOM was dominated by humic- and fulvic-like fluorescence (86. 3 – 95. 5 %) as measured by parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis of DOM fluorescence. Several reach-scale environmental variables showed significant positive (<b>leaf-area</b> <b>index,</b> sediment total N, organic C) or negative (stream temperature) linear relationships with BCP. However, an increasing contribution of terrestrial DOM, as measured by a decreasing fluorescence index (FI), was the strongest variable driving in situ benthic BCP (R 2  =  0. 38, p  =  0. 004, n  =  20). Forest harvesting did not significantly affect DOM source despite the major reach-scale disturbance that clearfell forestry represents. Nevertheless, conflicting evidence was found for changes in DOM composition after harvesting. Catchment-scale processes probably {{are more important than}} reach-scale processes in determining stream DOM biogeochemistry because clearfelled areas are small relative to the total catchment area.

The effects of various densities of wild radish and wheat on the growth and reproductive output of each other were investigated in field studies in 2003 and 2004. The experiments were established as a factorial combination of wheat (0, 100, 200, and 400 plants m⁻²) and wild radish (0, 15, 30, and 60 plants m⁻²) densities. The effect of wild radish density on wheat yield loss and wild radish seed production were described with a rectangular hyperbola model. The presence of wild radish in wheat reduced aboveground dry matter, <b>leaf-area</b> <b>index</b> (LAI), and grain yield of wheat, and {{the magnitude of this}} reduction was dependent on weed density. Increasing the density of wheat substantially reduced the adverse effects of wild radish on wheat. As crop density increased, wild radish dry matter, LAI, and seed production per unit area decreased. The maximum seed production of wild radish was achieved at its highest density (60 plants m⁻²), and was 43, 300 and 61, 200 seeds m⁻² for the first and second year, respectively. The results indicated that higher densities of wheat were able to suppress seed production of this weed species. From a practical viewpoint, this study shows that increased wheat density in the range of 200 to 400 wheat plants m⁻² can reduce wild radish seed production and also give some reduction in crop yield loss, and could be an important component of an integrated weed management program.

Vegetation cover and composition impose important influences on the regional climate in Africa. Climate-driven changes in vegetation structure {{and the distribution of}} forests versus savannah and grassland may feed back to climate via shifts in the surface energy balance, hydrological cycle and resultant effects on surface pressure and larger-scale atmospheric circulation. We used a regional Earth system model incorporating interactive vegetation–atmosphere coupling to investigate the potential role of vegetation-mediated biophysical feedbacks on climate dynamics in Africa in an RCP 8. 5 -based future climate scenario. The model was applied at high resolution (0. 44 [*]×[*] 0. 44 °) for the CORDEX-Africa domain with boundary conditions from the CanESM 2 general circulation model. We found that increased tree cover and <b>leaf-area</b> <b>index</b> (LAI) associated with a CO 2 and climate-driven increase in net primary productivity, particularly over subtropical savannah areas, not only imposed important local effect on the regional climate by altering surface energy fluxes but also resulted in remote effects over central Africa by modulating the land–ocean temperature contrast, Atlantic Walker circulation and moisture inflow feeding the central African tropical rainforest region with precipitation. The vegetation-mediated feedbacks were in general negative with respect to temperature, dampening the warming trend simulated in the absence of feedbacks, and positive with respect to precipitation, enhancing rainfall reduction over the rainforest areas.

Complex and data-intensive models used by researchers should be supplemented with simpler models based on easily measured parameters and easily understood competition functions. In experiments in the Philippine uplands, growth parameters of three popular farm-forestry species (Eucalyptus deglupta, E. torelliana, and Paraserianthes falcataria) were measured, along with intercropped and non-intercropped yields of maize and vegetables. The commonly used forestry parameter of stand basal area had a significant negative correlation with intercrop yields (as a percentage of non-intercropped yields). The slope of the regression line differed between species; in this study, percent yield loss per unit stem basal area growth was in the order E. deglupta > E. torelliana > P. falcataria. The relationship between stand basal area and intercrop-yield decline was tested on an independent data set from China. Intercrop yields had significant negative correlations with stand basal area of Paulownia elongata. We propose that adaptive tree-screening trials evaluate competitiveness in addition to evaluating growth and mortality. Stand basal area may be better suited to this task than more mechanistic indices such as <b>leaf-area</b> <b>index</b> as it is easy to measure, calculate, and understand, and it may serve as a better index of total (aboveground + belowground) competition. Basal area is also directly related to tree volume, and allows farmers to more easily evaluate the economic tradeoffs between tree growth and intercrop-yield declines...|$|E
40|$|Vegetation in {{the arctic}} tundra {{typically}} consists of a small-scale mosaic of plant communities, with species differing in growth forms, seasonality, and biogeochemical properties. Characterization of this variation is essential for understanding and modeling {{the functioning of the}} arctic tundra in global carbon cycling, as well as for evaluating the resolution requirements for remote sensing. Our objective was to quantify the seasonal development of the <b>leaf-area</b> <b>index</b> (LAI) and its variation among plant communities {{in the arctic}} tundra near Tiksi, coastal Siberia, consisting of graminoid, dwarf shrub, moss, and lichen vegetation. We measured the LAI in the field and used two very-high-spatial resolution multispectral satellite images (QuickBird and WorldView- 2), acquired at different phenological stages, to predict landscape-scale patterns. We used the empirical relationships between the plant community-specific LAI and degree-day accumulation (0 degrees C threshold) and quantified the relationship between the LAI and satellite NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index). Due to the temporal difference between the field data and satellite images, the LAI was approximated for the imagery dates, using the empirical model. LAI explained variation in the NDVI values well (R-adj. (2) 0. 42 - 0. 92). Of the plant functional types, the graminoid LAI showed the largest seasonal amplitudes and was the main cause of the varying spatial patterns of the NDVI and the related LAI between the two images. Our results illustrate how the short growing season, rapid development of the LAI, yearly climatic variation, and timing of the satellite data should be accounted for in matching imagery and field verification data in the Arctic region...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth and}} {{development}} of two early (Pusa ageti and T- 21) and three mediumduration (ST- 1, ICP- 1 and HY- 3 C) cultivars of pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.) were compared at Hyderabad, India, in 1974 and 1975; in 1976 cv. ICP- 1 was studied. The pigeonpeas were grown on a Vertisol and on an Alfisol. The crop growth rate in the first 2 months was low. The maximum rate of 171 kg/ha/day {{was found in the}} fourth month of growth of cv. ICP- 1 on Alfisol. The early cultivars, one of which (cv. Pusa ageti) was morphologically determinate, and the other (cv. T- 21) indeterminate, did not differ in the proportion of dry matter partitioned into seeds. The mean dry weight of the ab ove-ground parts of the medium cultivars on Vertisol in 1975 was 8 · 45 t/ha, including 2 · 23 t/ha of fallen plant material. The mean harvest index (ratio of grain dry weight to total plant dry weight) of these cultivars was 0 · 24 excluding fallen material and 0 · 17 taking fallen material into account. Starch reserves were present in the stems during the vegetative phase, but disappeared during the reproductive phase. In 1974 the maximum <b>leaf-area</b> <b>index</b> on Vertisol was 3 and on Alfisol 12 · 7. The net assimilation rate tended to decline throughout the growth period, but in the medium cultivars increased {{at the end of the}} reproductive phase, probably because of photosynthesis in pod walls and stems...|$|E
40|$|Seed {{terminal}} velocity and release height {{are recognized as}} key biotic determinants of long-distance dispersal (LDD) of seeds by wind. Yet, potential determinants at the ecosystem level, such as seasonal dynamics in foliage density characterizing many deciduous forests, have received much less attention. We integrated detailed field observations and experiments with a mechanistic wind dispersal model to assess how seasonal variation in foliage density, estimated by <b>leaf-area</b> <b>index</b> (LAI), affects LDD in deciduous forests. We found that the model, previously shown to accurately predict seed dispersal by wind, also reliably describes the effects of LAI variation on wind statistics {{for a wide range}} of canopy types. Sparser canopies are characterized by more organized vertical eddy motion that promotes LDD by uplifting seeds to higher elevations where winds are stronger. Yet, sparser canopies are also characterized by reduced mean windspeed aloft. We showed that former effect more than compensates for the latter, i. e., conditions of low LAI are favorable for LDD. This may account for the tendency of many temperate tree species to restrict seed release to either early spring or late fall, when LAI is relatively low. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the typical seasonal variation in LAI can be more important to LDD of seeds by wind than the natural variation in seed {{terminal velocity}}. Because our model accurately describes the effects of LAI variation for distinctly different sites, species, and life forms, we suggest that its results reflect a general association between LDD and foliage density dynamics...|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{improvement}} of grain yield {{is always an}} important objective in wheat breeding. Here, a genome-wide association {{study was conducted to}} parse the complex genetic composition of yield-related traits of 105 elite wheat varieties (lines) using the Wheat 90 K Illumina iSelect SNP array. Nine yield-related traits, including maximum number of shoots per square meter (MSN), effective number of spikes per square meter (ESN), percentage of effective spike (PES), number of kernels per spike (KPS), thousand-kernel weight (TKW), the ratio of kernel length/kernel width (RLW), <b>leaf-area</b> <b>index</b> (LAI), plant height (PH), and grain yield (GY), were evaluated across four environments. Twenty four highly significant marker-trait associations (MTAs) (P < 0. 001) were identified for nine yield-related traits on chromosomes 1 A, 1 D, 2 A (2), 3 B, 4 A (2), 4 B, 5 A (4), 5 B (4), 5 D, 6 B (2), 7 A (2), and 7 B (3), explaining 10. 86 - 20. 27 % of the phenotypic variations. Of these, four major loci were identified in more than three environments, including one locus for RLW (6 B), one locus for TKW (7 A), and two loci for PH (7 B). A cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) marker Td 99211 for TKW on chromosome 5 A was developed and validated in both a natural population composed of 372 wheat varieties (lines) and a RIL population derived from the cross of Yangxiaomai × Zhongyou 9507. The CAPS marker developed can be directly used for marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding, and the major MTAs identified can provide useful information for fine-mapping of the target genes in future studies...|$|E
40|$|<b>Leaf-area</b> <b>index</b> (LAI), {{the total}} one-sided {{surface area of}} leaf per ground surface area, is a key {{component}} of land surface models. We investigate the influence of differing, plausible LAI prescriptions on heat, moisture, and carbon fluxes simulated by the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLEv 1. 4 b) model over the Australian continent. A 15 -member ensemble monthly LAI data-set is generated using the MODIS LAI product and gridded observations of temperature and precipitation. Offline simulations lasting 29 years (1980 - 2008) are carried out at 25 km resolution with the composite monthly means from the MODIS LAI product (control simulation) and compared with simulations using each of the 15 -member ensemble monthly-varying LAI data-sets generated. The imposed changes in LAI did not strongly influence the sensible and latent fluxes but the carbon fluxes were more strongly affected. Croplands showed the largest sensitivity in gross primary production with differences ranging from - 90 to 60 %. PFTs with high absolute LAI and low inter-annual variability, such as evergreen broadleaf trees, showed the least response to the different LAI prescriptions, whilst those with lower absolute LAI and higher inter-annual variability, such as croplands, were more sensitive. We show that reliance on a single LAI prescription may not accurately reflect the uncertainty in the simulation of the terrestrial carbon fluxes, especially for PFTs with high inter-annual variability. Our study highlights that the accurate representation of LAI in land surface models is key to the simulation of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Hence this will become critical in quantifying the uncertainty in future changes in primary production...|$|E
