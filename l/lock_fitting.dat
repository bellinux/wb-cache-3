30|$|Each trial {{consisted}} of three separate runs of homogenized milk from the Purdue University Dairy Research and Education Center (W. Lafayette, IN). Three hundred gallons (~ 1136 L) per run were processed using the tubular pasteurizer followed by the MST chamber (Arofikin 2010). Milk was pumped into a mixing vat and inoculated with 1 L of the stored, concentrated P. fluorescens Migula or L. fermentum (4  ×  109 and 1.2  ×  1010 cfu/mL, respectively). Raw milk bacterial load was 5.7  ×  104 (± 1.5  ×  103) cfu/mL. The inoculated milk was then pumped into the holding basin within the pasteurization unit and processed. The duration of each run was approximately 30  min. Samples of milk were collected at 3 time points (10  min intervals) throughout the run, and at locations before processing, after the pasteurizer, and after the MST chamber. Before extraction, sterile sample diaphragms were attached to collecting ports, and were additionally treated with 70  % ethanol. Milk was extracted and collected via sterile 250  mL QMI sampling assembly bags (QMI, Oakdale, MN), with an 18 gauge needle and three feet of tubing. After the sampling bag was filled, the needles {{were removed from the}} port and capped with a Luer <b>lock</b> <b>fitting</b> and cap. Collected milk was immediately stored in an ice water bath and collecting ports were again sterilized with 70  % ethanol.|$|E

50|$|With the {{addition}} of misuse cases, the notation can model both desired goals and active threats. The misuse case notation shows negative (possibly hostile) stakeholders as the primary actors for the misuse cases; these may be grouped {{on the right-hand side}} of the diagram.

50|$|On the 24th inst. Mr McKenzie, supervisor, {{accompanied}} by Mess. Gorie and McNaugton, officers, discovered a private distillery, of considerable extent, under {{the arch of}} the South Bridge, which has been working these 18 months past, to the great injury of the revenue. The particulars of this seizure are worthy of notice, from the great pains which had been taken to prevent disclosure. The original door {{to the place where}} the operations were going forward had been carefully built up and plastered over, so as to prevent any appearance of an entrance. Behind a grate in the fireplace of a bed-room, an opening had been made, and fitted with an iron door and <b>lock,</b> exactly <b>fitting</b> the grate, which could only be seen by being removed; and this passage led to the flat above by a trap-door and ladder, where the still was working. This place again was in one of the deaf arches, immediately adjoining the middle arch of the bridge, (now The Caves venue), and the person had found means to convey a pipe from one of the town’s branches, which gave a plentiful supply of water. A soil pipe was also got at, and a hole broke through into a neighbouring vent to carry off the smoke. Besides the still, a considerable quantity of wash, and some low wines, were found in the premises; also many casks, mash ton, large tubs, etc. The spirits were said to have been conveyed away in a tin case, made to contain two or three gallons, which was again put into a green bag, and carried out by a woman under her cloak.|$|R
40|$|Most {{air duct}} system {{components}} are {{assembled in the}} field and are mechanically fastened by sheet metal screws (for sheet metal-to-sheet metal) or by drawbands (for flex duct-to-sheet metal). Air sealing is separate from this mechanical fastening and is usually achieved using tape or mastic products after mechanical fastening. Field observations have shown that mechanical fastening rarely meets code or manufacturers requirements and that sealing procedures are similarly inconsistent. To address these problems, Proctor Engineering Group (PEG) is developing a system of joining ducts (called PEGIT) that combines the mechanical fastening and sealing into a single self-contained procedure. The PEGIT system uses a shaped flexible seal between specially designed sheet metal duct fittings to both seal and fasten duct sections together. Figure 1 shows the inner duct fitting complete with rubber seal. This seal provides the air seal for the completed fitting and is shaped to allow the inner and outer fittings to slide together, and then to <b>lock</b> the <b>fittings</b> in place. The illustration in Figure 2 shows the approximate cross section of the rubber seal that shows how the seal has a lip that is angled backwards. This angled lip allows the joint to be pushed together by folding flat but then its long axis makes it stiff in the pulling apart direction. This study was undertaken to assist PEG in some of the design aspects of this system and to test the performance of the PEGIT system. This study was carried out in three phases. The initial phase evaluated the performance of a preliminary seal design for the PEGIT system. After the first phase, the seal was redesigned and this new seal was evaluated in the second phase of testing. The third phase performed more detailed testing of the second seal design to optimize the production tolerances of the sheet metal fittings. This report summarizes our findings from the first two phases and provides details about the third phase of testing...|$|R
40|$|The twin {{island nation}} of Trinidad and Tobago {{is located in}} the {{actively}} deforming Caribbean-South American (Ca-SA) plate boundary zone. Geodetic GPS work over the past decade has accurately determined present-day Ca-SA relative plate motion. This work (Weber et al., 2001; Perez et al., 2001; Lopez et al., 2006) clearly shows the Caribbean plate today moves approximately eastward relative to the South American plate at ~ 20 mm/yr. Earthquakes do not mark the active faults in Trinidad; however, a low-precision triangulation-to-GPS comparison at 23 sites showed that significant strikeslip faulting is probably occurring on the Central Range Fault (CRF) (Saleh et al., 2004). The lack of recent seismic activity on the CRF might indicate that the fault is elastically locked. Locked faults tend to store motion and then release it in infrequent big earthquakes, whereas creeping faults produce more continuous small earthquakes. A future large earthquake is therefore possible in our study area. Our research looks at Trinidad’s neotectonics using new GPS data from 19 high-stability sites that were built and measured in 2005, then measured again in 2007, and also includes data from a few sites that go back to 1994. These new data allow us to refine previous results from the lowerprecision geodetic work. We intend to better quantify the rate of slip across the CRF and its mechanical behavior. We used campaign-style GPS field measurements collected by coauthor Weber and associates at the University of the West Indies. We compiled these data and processed them using GIPSY/OASIS II (Release 5. 0) software at the University of Miami RSMAS Geodesy Lab. We find that in a South American reference frame sites north of the CRF move at about 20 (± 1 - 5) mm/yr; sites south of the CRF are stationary (± 1 - 8 mm/yr). Tobago site velocities are slightly oblique to the overall Caribbean plate motion due to a major (magnitude 6. 7) earthquake that had occurred off Tobago’s south coast in 1997. Our results support the hypotheses that the CRF is an active strike-slip fault. We find that sites in Tobago and northern Trinidad are on the Caribbean plate and move {{at a rate of about}} 20 mm/ yr eastward (relative to South America). Sites in southern Trinidad move slowly if at all relative to South America. We are <b>fitting</b> <b>locked</b> fault (elastic dislocation half-space) models to these data; this will allow us to look more closely at the mechanical behavior of the CRF and to establish whether it is locked or creeping to help evaluate its seismic hazard. This could be an important factor in determining the safety of citizens living in Trinidad and Tobago...|$|R
40|$|Chlorinated {{solvents}} {{are among}} the most common soil and groundwater contaminants due to their widespread use as cleaning solvents or degreasing agents. Due to their physico-chemical properties, chlorinated solvents produce large-scale plumes of pollution in the groundwater. In the densely populated north western Europe, these pollution plumes often are situated under residential and urban development areas and, therefore, not easily accessible. Vapors can migrate through building slabs and affect the quality of indoor air. That is why the CityChlor project was created. It aims at improving the quality and minimizing pollution of soil and groundwater by developing an integrated approach to tackle the threats caused by contamination with chlorinated solvents in urban areas. One of the goals of the project is to define the most reliable, fast, and cost-effective techniques to detect, characterize, and delineate chlorinated solvent pollution in groundwater. In this context, passive sampling is an innovative way of sampling contaminants in groundwater in Europe, and it seems very promising. Therefore, tests are required at each country level to make regulations concerning these samplers, which will encourage consultants to use them. That is why the aim of this work was to assess the performance of 3 passive samplers to sample chlorinated solvents in groundwater and to compare the results to those obtained with the traditional groundwater sampling method, that is to say well purging prior to groundwater sampling with a pump. The pilot site chosen to conduct these experiments is an in-service facility located in France, 60 km east from Paris, in an urban area. In this factory, door <b>locks</b> and metal <b>fittings</b> have been produced since 1926 and chlorinated solvents are used to remove grease marks from metal fittings. On site, soils are composed of one layer of silty embankments (2 to 3 m) and then a sandy horizon. The water table is at around 2 m below the ground surface and it goes to 10 m deep. In order to test passive sampling, 5 dedicated water wells were installed on site. In this way, the design of the wells was totally known and passive samplers were tested in controlled conditions. One of them was screened from 2 to 8 m deep and the other ones were screened respectively from 2 to 3. 5 m; 3. 5 to 5 m; 5 to 6. 5 m and 6. 5 to 8 m. Three passive samplers were therefore tested: PDB (Polyethylene Diffusion Bags), Ceramic Dosimeters and Gore Sorber Modules. Multilevel sampling was done in the well screened from 2 to 8 m and one sampler was installed in the middle of each screened interval of the other wells. This was done for the 3 samplers tested. PDB were very easy to install and the cost of these samplers was lower than the one corresponding to the conventional method with the pump. In addition, these samplers exhibited a good reproducibility. Ceramic dosimeters were very easy to use as well, but results were not reproducible for some compounds. Some tests are still in progress to confirm this trend. For Gore Sorber Modules, the first sampling campaigns gave consistent results comparing to the pump. In general, passive samplers seemed to be very efficient to sample HVOC in groundwater and to be a good alternative to the standard method with purge and sampling with a pump...|$|R

One of the goals of the project is to define the most reliable, fast and cost effective techniques to detect, characterize and delineate chlorinated solvent pollution in groundwater. In this context, Direct Push Technology (DPT) is an innovative technique in Europe to characterize soil, soil gas and groundwater pollution. The goal of this work was to assess this technique in order to evaluate its efficiency to locate polluted zones. This could be an important step of the characterization process of a polluted site which could help consultants to decide where to install groundwater and soil gas wells for an efficient site monitoring. This work was carried out on an in-service facility located 60 km from Paris, in an urban area. In this factory, door <b>locks</b> and metal <b>fittings</b> are produced and chlorinated solvents are used to remove grease marks from metal fittings. On site, soils are composed of 50 cm to 1 m of embankments, then about 3 m of clay and finally fine sand to 10 m deep. The alluvial aquifer was studied during the project: the mean depth of the water table was 1. 5 to 2 m below the ground surface and was about 10 m deep. Amongst the DPT, 3 specific techniques were used: the CPT (cone penetration test) which gives indications on the lithology, the MIP (Membrane Interface Probe) giving semi-quantitative concentrations of pollutants in soil and groundwater along a vertical profile and the BAT sampling allowing us to take depth discrete samples of groundwater. The DPT work was carried out in 2 steps. First of all, it was used as a screening technique: the tool was equipped with a CPT cone and a MIP probe and 19 locations were investigated outside and inside buildings near supposed pollution sources and downstream these pollution sources. Then, in the most polluted zones, 10 BAT sampling were carried out at 2 different depths. Thanks to the Robertson CPT soil classification, the CPT allowed us to determine the soil characteristics which were in accordance with the lithology observed during soil sampling. The MIP was very efficient as well to obtain a good picture of polluted areas. In addition, the results obtained after analyzing groundwater from the BAT sampling confirmed the ones given by the MIP. This work allowed us to highlight general advantages of the DPT. This technique is mobile and as we can get information on the contaminant concentration almost in real time thanks to the MIP system, this implies a better reactivity on site. As DPT systems are hold by mobile structures of different sizes, investigations can be carried out almost everywhere (in small buildings or outside). In addition the BAT sampling is a very efficient technique to carry out depth discrete sampling without cross contamination between the samples. Nevertheless other limitations have {{to be taken into account}} when planning to use such a technique. For example, DPT is not suitable when soils are too hard (the CPT cone could not get deeper than 6 - 7 m on this pilot site). Finally results are not obtained in real time with the MIP system because post treatment of raw data is needed before having final results on polluted areas...|$|R
