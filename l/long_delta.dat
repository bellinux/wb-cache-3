40|$|High-resolution tree-ring delta O- 18 chronologies {{covering}} the last millennium, although scarce, are essential in understanding patterns of climatic {{changes in the}} northeastern region of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. For this study, a tree-ring delta O- 18 chronology with a temporal resolution of 3 -years was developed from the long-lived Qilian juniper (Sabina przewalskii Kom.), extending {{back in time to}} AD 991. This <b>long</b> <b>delta</b> O- 18 chronology was significantly correlated with the yearly delta O- 18 in tree rings during the common period from 1800 to 2006, and was an effective proxy for relative humidity during the growing season. A low-frequency moisture pattern signified the occurrence of a slight drought during the Medieval Climate Anomaly, a marked occurrence of a wet period during the Little Ice Age, and a trend in increasing moisture levels, although lower than average, alongside the Twentieth Century warming trend. Comparisons to other hydroclimatic reconstructions indicate that this tree-ring delta O- 18 chronology serves as a reliable paleo-humidity proxy for the Qaidam Basin as well as documenting details of past humidity levels in the region...|$|E

40|$|Rats {{discriminate}} surface textures {{using their}} whiskers (vibrissae), but how whiskers extract texture information, {{and how this}} information is encoded by the brain, are not known. In the resonance model, whisker motion across different textures excites mechanical resonance in distinct subsets of whiskers, due to variation across whiskers in resonance frequency, which varies with whisker length. Texture information is therefore encoded by the spatial pattern of activated whiskers. In the competing kinetic signature model, different textures excite resonance equally across whiskers, and instead, texture is encoded by characteristic, nonuniform temporal patterns of whisker motion. We tested these models by measuring whisker motion in awake, behaving rats whisking in air and onto sandpaper surfaces. Resonant motion was prominent during whisking in air, with fundamental frequencies ranging from approximately 35 Hz for the <b>long</b> <b>Delta</b> whisker to approximately 110 Hz for the shorter D 3 whisker. Resonant vibrations also occurred while whisking against textures, but the amplitude of resonance within single whiskers was independent of texture, contradicting the resonance model. Rather, whiskers resonated transiently during discrete, high-velocity, and high-acceleration slip-stick events, which occurred prominently during whisking on surfaces. The rate and magnitude of slip-stick events varied systematically with texture. These results suggest that texture is encoded not by differential resonant motion across whiskers, but by the magnitude and temporal pattern of slip-stick motion. These findings predict a temporal code for texture in neural spike trains...|$|E
40|$|Catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) {{production}} {{has expanded to}} over one million tonnes in 2007 from ponds that cover about 5, 000 ha in the Cuu <b>Long</b> <b>delta,</b> Vietnam. From these ponds, large quantities of liquid and solid waste are discharged to waterways without treatment. Consequently, the pollution of canals or rivers by loading of fishpond waste, rich in nutrients (especially nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) {{has emerged as a}} major concern. A survey in the dry season 2007 of 16 paired fields showed that rice yield in 8 paddies receiving waste from fishpond was 1 t/ha higher than in another 8 paddies that did not use wastes. A field experiment was conducted in the wet season 2007 using three doses of solid wastes (1, 2 and 3 tonne/ha) in combination with 1 / 3 or 2 / 3 of the recommended inorganic fertiliser rate (60 N- 17 P- 24 K in kg/ha). Rice yields were {{more or less the same}} in all treatments, suggesting that the fishpond waste replaced 1 / 3 to 2 / 3 of the fertiliser normally applied. Another experiment was carried out using liquid waste from fishponds for irrigating i-ice together with inorganic fertilisers at 2 / 3 of the recommended farmer dosage. Rice yields were also the same in all treatments. These results confirmed that solid and liquid wastes from fishponds can be recycled for rice culture to mitigate pollution of waterway and reduce fertiliser costs...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} 1 -year long {{representative}} delta O- 18 record of water vapor (delta O- 18 (v)) in Niamey (Niger) using the Wavelength Scanned-Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy (WS-CRDS). We explore how {{local and regional}} atmospheric processes influence delta O- 18 (v) variability from seasonal to diurnal scale. At seasonal scale, delta O- 18 (v) exhibits a W-shape, associated {{with the increase of}} regional convective activity during the monsoon and the intensification of large scale subsidence North of Niamey during the dry season. During the monsoon season, delta O- 18 (v) records a broad range of intra-seasonal modes in the 25 - 40 -day and 15 - 25 -day bands that could be related to the well-known modes of the West African Monsoon (WAM). Strong delta O- 18 (v) modulations are also seen at the synoptic scale (5 - 9 days) during winter, driven by tropical-extra-tropical teleconnections through the propagation of a baroclinic wave train-like structure and intrusion of air originating from higher altitude and latitude. delta O- 18 (v) also reveals a significant diurnal cycle, which reflects mixing process between the boundary layer and the free atmosphere during the dry season, and records the propagation of density currents associated with meso-scale convective systems during the monsoon season.
