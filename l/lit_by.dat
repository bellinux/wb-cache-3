5|$|Bath Abbey was a Norman church {{built on}} earlier foundations. The present {{building}} {{dates from the}} early 16th century and shows a late Perpendicular style with flying buttresses and crocketed pinnacles decorating a crenellated and pierced parapet. The choir and transepts have a fan vault by Robert and William Vertue. A matching vault {{was added to the}} nave in the 19th century. The building is <b>lit</b> <b>by</b> 52 windows.|$|E
5|$|La Pausa {{contains}} three wings {{that face}} onto a shaded courtyard, with the rooms containing large fireplaces. The rooms were filled by Chanel with 16th-century English oak furniture, {{given to her}} by the Duke of Westminster; English oak was also used for floors and panelling. The large reception rooms were <b>lit</b> <b>by</b> wrought-iron chandeliers from Spain.|$|E
5|$|On 8 December 1864, {{the bridge}} was <b>lit</b> <b>by</b> {{magnesium}} flares for its ceremonial opening parade, but they were blown out by the wind. The custom of lighting the bridge has continued with more recent events, although later thousands of electric light bulbs were attached to the bridge instead of flares.|$|E

5|$|Salford {{developed}} several civic institutions; in 1806, Chapel Street {{became the}} first street {{in the world to}} be <b>lit</b> <b>by</b> gas (supplied by Phillips and Lee's cotton mill). In 1850, {{under the terms of the}} Museums Act 1845, the municipal borough council established the Royal Museum and Public Library, said to have been the first unconditional free public library in England, preceding the Public Libraries Act 1850.|$|E
5|$|Salford {{has become}} a centre of higher education, home to the University of Salford, and has seen several firsts, {{including}} the world's first unconditionally free public library, and the first street {{in the world to}} be <b>lit</b> <b>by</b> gas, Chapel Street in 1806. Salford's MediaCityUK became the headquarters of CBBC and BBC Sport in 2011, joined by ITV Granada in 2013.|$|E
5|$|The Lee Dining Room is {{used for}} formal banquets. It is <b>lit</b> <b>by</b> an 1825 Irish crystal chandelier. One hundred place {{settings}} of fine china and 150 place settings of sterling silver flatware were acquired from Tiffany & Co. in 1988 {{for use in the}} dining room.|$|E

5|$|The Mutoscope {{worked on}} the same {{principle}} as a flip book, with individual image frames printed onto flexible cards attached to a circular core which revolved with the turn of a user-operated hand crank. The cards were <b>lit</b> <b>by</b> electric light bulbs inside the machine, a system devised by Arthur Marvin's brother, Henry, {{one of the founders}} of the Biograph company. Earlier machines had relied on reflected natural light.|$|E
5|$|The {{street was}} one of the first in London to be <b>lit</b> <b>by</b> gas after Frederick Albert Winsor set up {{experimental}} lighting on 4 June 1807 to celebrate King George III's birthday. Permanent lighting was installed in 1820. The eastern end of Pall Mall was widened between 1814 and 1818; a row of houses on its north side was demolished to make way for the Royal Opera Arcade.|$|E
5|$|Chard {{claims to}} be the birthplace of powered flight, as it was here in 1848 that the Victorian {{aeronautical}} pioneer John Stringfellow first demonstrated that engine-powered flight was possible through his work on the Aerial Steam Carriage. North Petherton was the first town in England (and one of the few ever) to be <b>lit</b> <b>by</b> acetylene gas lighting, supplied by the North Petherton Rosco Acetylene Company. Street lights were provided in 1906. Acetylene was replaced in 1931 by coal gas produced in Bridgwater, {{as well as by the}} provision of an electricity supply.|$|E

5|$|Finding its {{locomotive}} {{works at}} Kittybrewster cramped and inadequate, the Great North began construction {{on a new}} works at Inverurie in 1898, electric lighting being provided in the buildings. The carriage and wagon department moved in 1901, the locomotive department in 1902, the offices the following year and the permanent way department in 1905; the buildings still stand and are listed Category B. Inverurie station was rebuilt nearer the works in 1902, and is similarly a Category B building. The Great North built houses nearby for its staff, <b>lit</b> <b>by</b> electricity generated at the works, and the Inverurie Loco Works Football Club was formed by staff in 1902.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his service}} in Korea, Mitchell was posted in Britain, but in late 1957, he {{returned}} to the Argylls as a company commander with the 1st Battalion, and was posted to Cyprus. At the time, the Cyprus Emergency was in full swing. Mitchell was placed in charge of the coastal towns of Paphos and Ktima, where his men engaged in counter-insurgency operations against EOKA guerrillas. They faced both conventional EOKA raids and forest fires deliberately <b>lit</b> <b>by</b> EOKA fighters and local villagers who were motivated by the money they would receive to fight them.|$|E
5|$|In both {{of these}} works the candlelit setting had a realist justification. Viewing {{sculpture}} by candlelight, when the contours showed well and there might even be an impression of movement from the flickering light, was a fashionable practice described by Goethe. In the orrery demonstration the shadows cast by the lamp representing the sun were {{an essential part of}} the display, used to demonstrate eclipses. But there seems no reason other than heightened drama to stage the air pump experiment in a room <b>lit</b> <b>by</b> a single candle, and in two later paintings of the subject by Charles-Amédée-Philippe van Loo the lighting is normal.|$|E

In 2006, acrobats formed {{the shape of a}} dove. The 2008 ceremony had fireworks representing doves. In 2010, dove figures were projected on the stage floor. The 2012 ceremony had bicyclists with dove-wings, <b>lit</b> <b>by</b> LEDs. In the 2014 ceremony several dancers, holding strands of blue LED lights, danced on the shape of a dove projected on the stadium floor. In the 2016 ceremony , children with dove shaped kites were seen running with the first Olympic Laurel winner, Kipchoge Keino.|$|E
5|$|The Savoy Hotel, {{designed}} by the architect Thomas Edward Collcutt, opened in 1889. Financed by profits from The Mikado, {{it was the first}} hotel <b>lit</b> <b>by</b> electric lights and the first with electric lifts. In the 1890s, under its famous manager, César Ritz, and chef Auguste Escoffier, it became a well-known luxury hotel and would generate more income and contribute more to the D'Oyly Carte fortunes than any other enterprise, including the opera companies. Carte later acquired and refurbished Claridge's (1893), The Grand Hotel in Rome (1896), Simpson's-in-the-Strand (1898) and The Berkeley (1900).|$|E
5|$|The {{advent of}} steel frame {{structural}} systems allowed completely vertical construction; {{but as with}} many skyscrapers of the era, the exterior was designed with multiple setbacks at increasing heights, which served to allow additional light into the ever-deepening concrete valleys in urban cores. At night, the setbacks are upwardly <b>lit</b> <b>by</b> floodlights, further emphasizing the structure's vertical elements. The night illumination design was a common contemporary Chicago architectural theme, seen also in the Wrigley Building, the Jewelers Building, the Palmolive Building, the LaSalle-Wacker Building, and the Tribune Tower.|$|E
