40|$|In the 1990 s lean {{manufacturing}} became a common term in business literature. The underlying principles of <b>lean</b> manufacturing <b>are</b> <b>well</b> founded in operations management; however, <b>lean</b> <b>is</b> usually {{described as a}} collection of best practices. Among these best practices is a production and inventory control technique known as pull. There is a surprising dearth of information about pull system implementation. Some researchers even suggest that “many manufacturers {{will never be able to}} implement pull. ” To the contrary, when implemented properly we have found pull systems to be a readily accepted lean practice that provides immediate and remarkable improvements in business performance...|$|R

This phenomenon <b>is</b> described in <b>lean</b> systems as mix leveling. This paper approach product mix leveling problem from a dynamic perspective. A system dynamics model is developed to explore the dynamics associated with the WIP level performance at different mix leveling policies in a lean environment. The system captures different lean tools and policies. Results showed that the best WIP performance is sensitive to both the degree of lean tools implementation {{as well as the}} capacity scalability level of the system. The presented analysis showed that dynamic capacity is essential for successful mix leveling policies; however, investments in such scalability can be minimized with shorter production cycles as well as efficient JIT implementation. In addition, the positive impact of SMED on WIP accumulation in <b>lean</b> environment <b>was</b> <b>well</b> demonstrated...|$|R

50|$|A second ongoing controversy, {{within the}} lean {{community}} itself, concerns how closely lean thinkers should follow Toyota practices. This {{is a tricky}} subject because {{on the one hand}} Toyota is the inventor of <b>lean</b> and <b>is</b> <b>well</b> ahead in both knowledge and experience but, on the other hand, why would methods invented by a Japanese auto manufacturer apply anywhere else? In fact, this debate rests on the assumption that Toyota is a monolithic company with a single unified practice. In actual terms, Toyota has changed considerably from its 1970s roots and is now a global company with hundreds of sites across all continents - no two sites are alike and although there are similar principles at work, local practices vary considerably from site to site. No one comes out of any conversation completely unchanged and, for instance, in talking to GE one comes back GE-fied as in talking to Toyota, one comes back Toyota-fied, so to speak. This debate is thus vital for the lean movement as confronting Toyota practices, such as they are here and there, to other environments is the starting point of lean thinking. In this respect, “how much like Toyota thinking should <b>lean</b> thinking be?” <b>is</b> a question without an answer that merits constant, case by case consideration.|$|R

In this context, the objective of this research was to verify the integration of the Lean Construction methodology with the traditional project management, as well as the expected objectives and the results achieved through this integration. For this purpose, a systematic review of the literature was proposed in order to verify the studies that have addressed the theme in the last ten years. After the review, a strong trend was identified in the integration of Lean Construction with agile methodologies such as Last Planner and critical path method, as well as the verification of the potential of the integration of the two methodologies, due to the positive results indicated by the analysis of the selected articles that pointed considerable improvements in quality, schedule and cost management...|$|R
40|$|<b>Lean</b> IT <b>is</b> the {{extension}} of lean manufacturing and lean services principles to the development and management of information technology (IT) products and services. Its central concern, applied {{in the context of}} IT, is the elimination of waste, where waste is work that adds no value to a product or service. Although <b>lean</b> principles <b>are</b> generally <b>well</b> established and have broad applicability, their extension from manufacturing to IT is only just emerging. [1] Indeed, Lean IT poses significant challenges for practitioners while raising the promise of no less significant benefits.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis is to examine how <b>Lean</b> <b>is</b> applied at the Akademiska {{hospital}} in Uppsala, Sweden. <b>Lean</b> <b>is</b> regarded as a solution for many issues connected to healthcare.

40|$|Purpose - Service {{businesses}} {{are struggling with}} customer demands for better quality service and managerial demands for cost reduction. There is {{evidence to suggest that}} service {{businesses are}} in practice failing on both these counts, seeing increased costs and reductions in service quality. The application of lean production approaches to the service context has been suggested as a means to resolve these problems, reducing Costs and improving quality. Despite the validation of lean approaches in the product-service context, the application of lean approaches in the Pure service environment remains largely untested. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to assess the suitability of lean production methodologies in the pure service context. Design/methodology/approach - Three financial service companies in the UK were followed through a common programme of lean transformation. The improvements observed in each company were recorded. The change programme is evaluated to determine the "leanness" of the initiatives. The suitability of lean for the service context is discussed. Findings - The paper's findings highlight significant improvements in quality and cost positions with minimal investment through adoption of lean tools in the pure service context. The paper proposes the suitability of basic lean methodologies Such as value understanding, process mapping and problem solving for the pure service context. Originality/value - The <b>lean</b> approach <b>is</b> <b>well</b> established in the manufacturing sector and certain product-service contexts. Evidence on lean in pure service environments is very limited. The paper addresses this shortcoming...|$|R

40|$|The {{quality of}} the Swedish {{healthcare}} has a prominent position internationally, but long queues for various treatments, are today often criticized and debated. However, patient queues and delays are often {{not the result of}} resource problems - they are the result of ow problems. The trend {{in recent years has been}} a knowledge transfer from the manufacturing industry to healthcare on how to create ow. Lean Manufacturing, which originates from the Toyota production system, has received a lot of attention. While <b>Lean</b> Manufacturing <b>is</b> a <b>well</b> described management framework, the proceeding to become ", referred to as a Transformation" is considered more contextual. This study, conducted in 2010, investigates how to achieve sustainable Lean Transformations in the context of the Swedish healthcare system, with a focus on the patient ow through surgery departments. The methodology was designed as a qualitative case study, with a triangulation of data sources: a main case (KSS Skovde) and a reference case (SUS Lund), combined with the breadth of view from literature. In the main case, the author participated in a process improvement team as an action researcher. The reference case was investigated with interviews. The concrete measures identified on how to improve the patient ow, are very similar between the two cases, and <b>are</b> also <b>well</b> in line with basic Lean concepts. This suggests that other Swedish hospitals, who are in the beginning of a Lean transformation, have much to gain from studying the findings from others. The great challenge is however to create sustainability, which is basically a question of suitable leadership and cultural change. Even if these areas are less tangible, the issues and findings from the two cases have a lot in common, most of which references can <b>be</b> found in <b>Lean</b> literature. The report also discusses how <b>Lean</b> <b>is</b> not an option in the healthcare system - it is a necessity. Moreover, it is argued why the entrepreneurial drive is something that possibly needs attention in the healthcare Lean work, despite the Lean literature in general advocates the opposite...|$|R
