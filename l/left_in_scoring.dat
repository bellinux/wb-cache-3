5000|$|In {{the sport}} of baseball, a baserunner {{is said to be}} in scoring {{position}} when he is on second or third base. The distinction between being on first base and second or third base is that a runner on first can usually only score if the batter hits an extra-base hit, while a runner on second or third can score on a single. This is also known as [...] "ducks on the pond". Runners <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> position refers to the number of runners on second or third base {{at the end of an}} inning and is an inverse measure of a team's offensive efficiency.|$|E
5000|$|... 7:30 p.m. (EDT) at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, MissouriGame 5 saw {{a battle}} of the aces with Adam Wainwright on the short end as Lester pitched another gem of 7 2/3 innings. Boston struck first on {{back-to-back}} one out doubles by Dustin Pedroia and David Ortiz, who continued his monstrous tear, hitting [...]733 in the series. Wainwright ended up striking out the side {{in the first two}} innings before Jon Lester broke the streak with a groundout. St. Louis had back-to-back leadoff singles {{in the second and third}} by Carlos Beltrán and David Freese, latter advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt by Pete Kozma but was <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> position. In the fourth Ortiz tied a World Series record by Billy Hatcher on a hit, reaching base in nine consecutive plate appearances, but failed to set a new record by flying out to center field in the sixth. With one out in the bottom of the fourth, Matt Holliday hit a solo shot to center field to tie the game. Boston threatened in the fifth after a leadoff hit by Xander Bogaerts and a one out single by David Ross but Wainwright struck out Lester and Ellsbury to strand both runners. After a leadoff single by Bogaerts, Stephen Drew walked and Ross drove in one run on a ground rule double to left field. With two runners in scoring position Ellsbury's single scored Drew but Ross was tagged out at home plate on the throw by Shane Robinson. In the bottom of the eighth Lester allowed a one out double against Freese and Koji Uehara took over the mound for a four out save after Kozma hit a fly ball to left field for the second out of the inning. Uehara struck out pinch hitter Matt Adams on three pitches for the third out. The Red Sox closer struck out Matt Carpenter, grounded out pinch hinter John Jay and Holliday flew out to right field to earn the save in back-to-back games. This was the first game of this series neither team committed an error.|$|E

50|$|In some cases, A to Z {{might not}} be enough. After Z, Aa may be used, {{followed}} by Bb, and so on until Zz (though Ii, Jj and/or Oo might also be skipped). The Wilhelm Hansen edition of Jean Sibelius's Symphony No. 7 in C major presents one unusual case: the letters A to Z (including both I and J) are used up with just three more pages <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the <b>score.</b> For the final flute and bassoon solo, the editors use Ö (the final letter of the Finnish alphabet) as a rehearsal letter.|$|R

5000|$|The symphony {{opens in}} a {{sweeping}} sequence of parallel open fifths and octaves (the first seventeen bars of which Elgar <b>left</b> <b>in</b> full <b>score)</b> building to a march rhythm. By contrast the second subject is [...] "sublimely wistful". There is an exposition repeat indicated by Elgar, and a calm new theme for strings introduces the development section, which later has a lively {{theme for the}} horns. A march section in B flat minor follows. After the recapitulation, the coda brings together the main themes and the movement ends with a majestic C major conclusion based on the opening theme. The movement, taking about sixteen minutes in performance, though on a large scale, is shorter than the equivalent movements of Elgar's first and second symphonies.|$|R

50|$|Eddie Plank {{returned}} for the A's against Joe McGinnity for the Giants in Game 4. Both <b>left</b> men on <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> position early on, {{and kept the}} game scoreless until {{the bottom of the}} fourth, when Sam Mertes led off the inning by reaching on an error by Monte Cross. After Bill Dahlen flied to right Art Devlin grounded out, moving Mertes to second. With two outs, Billy Gilbert singled to left, bringing Mertes home for the only run of the game, McGinnity outdueling Plank 1-0 and giving the Giants a three-games-to-one lead.|$|R
5000|$|Game 4 {{was another}} {{marathon}} affair. Joe Saunders and Phil Hughes matched zeroes for four innings, before Nate McLouth led off the fifth for Baltimore {{with a home}} run. The Yankees responded in the sixth when Robinson Canó had an RBI groundout, but they <b>left</b> a runner <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> position <b>in</b> that inning when Alex Rodriguez struck out. Rodriguez also left men on second and third with one out {{in the bottom of}} the eighth, dropping his batting average for the series down to [...]125 and continuing to draw the scorn of Yankees fans.|$|R
50|$|In {{light of}} similar incidents, coaches are often accused of {{running up the}} score and taking the {{opportunity}} to humiliate and embarrass a weak opponent. At times, large margins of victory occur in games where the winning school's reserves (second-string and junior varsity players) played a good share of the contest and simply were able to score at will against the weaker opposition. However, when the star players are <b>left</b> <b>in</b> to set <b>scoring</b> records, as happened with Epiphanny Prince's 113-point basketball game in 2006, criticism usually follows.|$|R
25|$|After {{starting}} their training camp on September 23, the Barons lost {{both of their}} two preseason games in overtime, starting with a 3–2 loss to the Texas Stars on September 27. Gernat and Joel Broda scored for Oklahoma City, but forward Mike Heddenn got the game-winner 58 seconds into the extra period. The Barons lost a preseason game against the San Antonio Rampage on September 28, falling 2–1 after San Antonio center Jared Gomes tied the game with 12.9 seconds <b>left</b> <b>in</b> regulation, then <b>scored</b> the game's lone shootout goal against Oklahoma City goalie Ty Rimmer.|$|R

50|$|Up 2-1 {{in their}} first round series against the Brooklyn Nets, the Bulls faced a 109-95 deficit in game 4 with less than three minutes <b>left</b> <b>in</b> regulation. Robinson <b>scored</b> 12 {{unanswered}} points to bring the Bulls back and eventually win the game in triple overtime. He finished the game with 34 points, including 23 points in the 4th quarter, just one point shy of Michael Jordan's franchise playoff record. The Nets won the next two games setting up a decisive game 7 in Brooklyn that the Bulls won, which was their first road game 7 victory in franchise history.|$|R
50|$|His {{successor}} {{failed to}} capitalize. HamKam picked up where they <b>left</b> off <b>in</b> 2005, <b>scoring</b> some spectacular wins against top teams while again {{being unable to}} perform consistently. As the season neared its end, however, Frode Grodås failed where Solbakken had succeeded, namely in keeping HamKam away from the relegation zone. Going into {{the final round of}} the season, they found themselves third {{from the bottom of the}} table and in need of a win. HamKam instead suffered a humiliating 1-5 loss at home, dropping to 13th place and relegation in 2006.|$|R
50|$|Walter Ephraim Brown (1867 - after 1890) was an English footballer {{who played}} in the Football Alliance for Small Heath.

50|$|Hanson {{started playing}} high school {{basketball}} in Washington at Blaine High School before moving to Mercer Island High School for his senior year. He was nationally recruited by universities to play basketball, a rarity at {{the time for a}} player in the Northwest. He decided to attend University of Washington, whose basketball coach, Tippy Dye, had helped make center Bob Houbregs an All-American. In 1962, Hanson became the first Husky to lead the conference in rebounding. On January 12, 1962, he scored 37 points and led the team to an 85-67 upset of No. 4 USC; he became just the third player in school history to reach 30 points in a game. He averaged 20.8 points per game during his college career, and <b>left</b> Washington second <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>in</b> school history behind Houbregs (25.6).|$|R
25|$|McGraw entered game {{three in}} the eighth inning with a runner on second, and one out. He managed {{to get out of the}} inning, and keep the Astros {{scoreless}} until the eleventh inning, when Joe Morgan led the inning off with a triple. Rafael Landestoy entered the game as a pinch runner for Morgan, and McGraw intentionally walked the next two batters to create a force at any base. The strategy didn't work, as the following batter, Denny Walling, hit a sacrifice fly to Greg Luzinski <b>in</b> <b>left</b> field <b>scoring</b> Landestoy.|$|R
5000|$|Like many requiems, Duruflé's omits the Gradual and the Tract. [...] Libera me, In Paradisum, {{from the}} burial service, {{mirroring}} Fauré), makes the composition calmer and more meditative {{than some other}} settings. <b>In</b> the full <b>score,</b> the fifth movement, Pie Jesu, has the only solo for the mezzo-soprano; in addition, even in the [...] "organ-only" [...] version of the Requiem, there is an obbligato cello solo. The baritone soloist has parts in the third movement, Domine Jesu Christe, and the penultimate movement, Libera me. Duruflé <b>left</b> indications <b>in</b> the <b>score</b> that, for the baritone soloist at least, it was preferable to have the choir sing the solos instead. This has resulted in various forces being used in different performances, some with both soloists, some with only the mezzo-soprano, and some (such as Robert Shaw's Telarc recording) using no soloists at all.|$|R
5|$|Taylor's {{first season}} at Villa ended with {{automatic}} promotion as Second Division runners-up, being pipped {{to the title}} by Millwall. One player who contributed to that season's success was the recently signed David Platt, a former Manchester United reserve who had signed from Crewe Alexandra for £200,000 just after Taylor's arrival. Before he <b>left</b> <b>in</b> 1991, Platt <b>scored</b> 68 goals <b>in</b> his 155 appearances for the club. Villa avoided relegation {{on the last day}} of the 198889 season as other results favoured them. In the 198990 season they emerged as surprise contenders for the title, leading for three weeks in the latter stages of the season before finishing in second place, nine points behind Liverpool. Taylor departed for the England manager's job and was succeeded by Slovak coach Jozef Vengloš, the first foreign manager in the First Division.|$|R

50|$|The Panthers' {{first home}} {{game of the}} season was a duel against the {{defending}} super bowl champions, the Green Bay Packers. Cam Newton threw for once again another 400+ yard game, becoming the first rookie ever to do so and only the 6th quarterback in NFL history to accomplish such a feat. Newton picked up where he left off against the Cardinals with an early <b>score</b> with 9:26 <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the 1st quarter of the game. The Panthers would lead 13-7 at halftime, stunning the defending Super Bowl champions. However, Green Bay would come back when Aaron Rodgers threw a 49-yard touchdown pass to a wide-open Greg Jennings to put the Packers up 14-13. A big game-changer was when there was 9:31 <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the 3rd quarter of the game. Cam Newton found Steve Smith, but Smith fumbled the football and Charles Woodson picked it up. Another big game changer was on a 4th and 4 at the Packers 6-yard line with 3:23 <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the game, <b>score</b> being 23-16 Packers, Cam Newton tried to scramble for the first down, but was 2 yards shy. The Packers would go on to win the game, 30-23, a much closer game than expected, but the Panthers still fell to 0-2 on the season.|$|R

50|$|The Vipers {{won their}} third {{straight}} game {{and handed the}} Iron their first loss {{of the season with}} a 75-67 win.

Their lead would carry into the 4th quarter, when Alabama took control of the game with a pair of touchdown passes by Kevin Eakin. Larry Shipp had a 48-yard rushing touchdown with just over a minute left. The Iron scored a touchdown with 39 seconds remaining to cut Alabama's lead to 8 points, but the Vipers recovered the ensuing onside kick and ran the clock out for the win. Eakin finished with 221 yards and 7 touchdowns. C.J. Johnson was the leading receiver with 91 yards and 3 touchdowns.|$|R
