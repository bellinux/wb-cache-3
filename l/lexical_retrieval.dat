Though some of these seem more likely to be affected than others, e.g. grammar and lexical knowledge are more likely to suffer a high attrition process.

Nevertheless, it can be said that productive skills are more affected than receptive ones, which mainly remain constantly stable (Cohen 1989) and if the learner shows already signs of language attrition it is more likely that transfer from L1 will happen (Berman & Olshtain 1983). Cohen examined in his studies several strategies, the learner applies to compensate the lack of adequate speaking skills, e.g. one strategy is code-switching, to uphold the communication. Another phenomenon observable is a kind of [...] "mixed-language". Müller (1995) states that on many levels of speaking the learner falls back on a mixture between different languages. Still, it is important to mention, that, as with almost every study that has been conducted in the different sub-fields of second-language acquisition research, several problems arise. There are longitudinal vs. cross-sectional studies, different variables, which have been used, and mainly terms and conditions of acquisition and incubation period are not standardised, particularly the length of the incubation period (Feuerhake 2004: 8). That means, some studies only observe language attrition after language programs, other look at the attrition in between breaks of language programs and studies, which examine the attrition after change of environment, regarding language and living conditions (Cohen 1975, Olshtain 1989).

The effect of the language group differed according to each task, where both monolinguals and bilinguals performed about similarly on working memory tasks, monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on <b>lexical</b> <b>retrieval</b> tasks, and bilinguals outperformed monolinguals on executive control tasks. Further analysis showed that bilinguals did, in fact, have inferior language knowledge as compared to monolinguals, yet similar working memory abilities. However, bilinguals did show overall superior executive control functions to their monolingual counterparts. In addition, the greatest levels of executive control were achieved by the older bilingual group, in accordance with the prediction that bilingualism throughout the lifespan attenuates the age-related deterioration of executive control tasks - those tasks that were nonverbal in nature, as bilinguals tend to do worse than monolinguals on linguistic measures.|$|E

40|$|The {{factors that}} affect the access and <b>retrieval</b> of <b>lexical</b> items have {{received}} {{a considerable amount of}} attention in the literature. Initial work suggested that frequency played a fundamental role in the production of words. For exam-ple, Oldfield and Wingfield (1965) concluded from their picture-naming study that high-frequency items were ac-cessed more quickly and easily than low-frequency items. More recent studies have also suggested the importance of frequency in the naming of pictures (Jescheniak & Levelt, 1994). However, other work has suggested that age of ac-quisition (AoA) and not word frequency (WF), is the pri-mary determinant of the speed of <b>lexical</b> access, <b>retrieval...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluated}} whether lexical {{selection in}} speech production {{is affected by}} word frequency by means of two experiments. In Experiment 1 participants named pictures using utterances with the structure “pronoun þ verb þ adjective”. In Experiment 2 participants had to perform a gender decision task on the same pictures. Access to the noun’s grammatical gender is needed in both tasks, and therefore <b>lexical</b> selection (lemma <b>retrieval)</b> is required. However, retrieval of the phonological properties (lexeme retrieval) of the referent noun is not needed to perform the tasks. In both experiments we observed faster latencies for high-frequency pictures than for low-frequency pictures. This frequency effect was stable over four repetitions of the stimuli. Our results suggest that <b>lexical</b> selection (lemma <b>retrieval)</b> is sensitive to word frequency. This interpretation runs against the hypothesis that a word’s frequency exerts its effects only at {{the level at which}} the phonological properties of words are retrieved...|$|R
50|$|The {{cohort model}} {{relies on a}} number of {{concepts}} in the theory of <b>lexical</b> <b>retrieval.</b> The lexicon is the store of words in a person's mind.; it contains a person's vocabulary and is similar to a mental dictionary. A lexical entry is all the information about a word and the lexical storage is the way the items are stored for peak retrieval. Lexical access is the way that an individual accesses the information in the mental lexicon. A word's cohort is composed of all the lexical items that share an initial sequence of phonemes., and is the set of words activated by the initial phonemes of the word.|$|E
50|$|Part of the {{motivation}} for the distinction between performance and competence comes from speech errors: despite having a perfect understanding of the correct forms, a speaker of a language may unintentionally produce incorrect forms. This is because performance occurs in real situations, and so is subject to many non-linguistic influences. For example, distractions or memory limitations can affect <b>lexical</b> <b>retrieval</b> (Chomsky 1965:3), and give rise to errors in both production and perception or distractions. Such non-linguistic factors are completely independent of the actual knowledge of language, and establish that speakers' knowledge of language (their competence) is distinct from their actual use of language (their performance).|$|E

In Metcalf & Kornell’s research the incubation period helped participants to retrieve the word by the same amount for the original non-blocked TOTs and the blocked TOTs. This suggests that blockers have no effect on the retrieval or the causes of tip of the tongue states.|$|E
50|$|Along with {{structural}} priming, {{clients with}} aphasia perform semantic priming, but they require {{more time to}} complete language tasks such as the lexical decision task. This {{is largely due to}} the large onset competitor effect, meaning the inability to distinguish words with shared semantic onsets (Yee, Blumstein & Sedivy, 2009). However, aphasic patients perform at chance levels for semantic judgment tasks. In comparison to normal patients, those with aphasia will increasingly fixate on words semantically related to the target. Therefore, they are able to access lexical entries and activate the lexical network but lack the ability to use such information within an offline task (McNellis & Blumstein, 2001, p. 162). Semantic representations decline largely due to the blurring of category boundaries, reduced difference between basic terms, incapability to judge semantic relatedness and abnormal activation of semantic representations of nonwords. Further, aphasia is characterized by deficits in <b>lexical</b> <b>retrieval</b> through the presence of nonword errors (Marshall, 2006, pg. 392). Nonword errors are typically substituted for content words and follow pauses. Many times, patients will not recognize their speech errors and continue communicating jargon with little to no self-monitoring of the speech output (Marshall, 2006, p. 398).|$|E

40|$|<b>Lexical</b> access—the <b>retrieval</b> {{of words}} from the mental lexicon that convey the {{syntactic}} and phonological makeup for expressing preverbal communicative thoughts—lies {{at the very heart}} of human speech production. This process is generally assumed to entail the selection of a target lexical candidate from among coactivated alternatives (Caramazza, 1997; Dell, 1986; Levelt, Roelofs, & Meyer, 1999). For instance, upon naming a pictured object (e. g., mouse), activation spreads to the target and semantically related concepts (e. g., cat, dog, cheese, etc.), and all active concepts pass some activation to their lexical entries. As a result, not only the target lexical entry but also seman-tically related alternatives are active at the lexical level. Whether target selection demands are influenced by the state of activation of lexical alternatives is a central issue in speech production, and is currently a matter of intense debate. According to one view, lexical selection is characterized by competition. Related nontarget entries (e. g., cat, dog) directly compete with the target utterance (mouse), thereby delaying lexical selection and the naming response (Abde...|$|R
40|$|Background: It {{has been}} argued that {{perseveration}} type corresponds to the level of breakdown so that total perseveration (the repetition of a whole word) involves the reactivation of a previous word at the lexical level when the target word is not sufficiently activated. A blended perseveration (the repetition of part of a previous response) results from a failure of target activation at the phoneme level (e. g. Martin & Dell 2007). This is challenged by the occurrence of non-word total perseverations, as these cannot be <b>lexical</b> <b>retrievals</b> (Hirsh 1998). A further problem is the occurrence of long intervals between perseverations and their sources. Some authors have invoked semantic relationships to explain these intervals (e. g. Martin, Roach, Brecher & Lowery 1998). Aims: This study examines the perseveration of two individuals with jargon aphasia in order to explore the proposal that while some perseveration may result from the reactivation of a recent response via the mechanisms described above, another mechanism exists whereby perseverative responses are built around default phonology, resulting in stereotypical errors. Methodology and Procedures: Tests of naming, reading and repetition were administered. Responses were analysed to determine: the extent of perseveration; the occurrence of long intervals between perseverations and their sources; patterns of phoneme use; the occurrence of non-word total perseverations. Outcomes and Results: Both individuals produced large numbers of perseverative responses. Lengthy intervals could not be explained by semantic relationships. For each participant, certain consonants were found to dominate the phoneme frequency distribution. Evidence was found of an interaction between the occurrence of perseveration and presence of these favoured consonants. The possibility that non-word total perseverations arose from a different source from word total perseverations was rejected because {{there was no significant difference}} in the use of the favoured phonemes between the two types. Conclusion: The findings support the theory of two mechanisms for perseveration. The first is local, occurring when residual activation overrides incoming activation. This is confined to a single speech act and occurs closely after the original occurrence. The second type is global, occurring across different contexts over time. It occurs because of default phonology, available in the event of a dearth of incoming activation at the phoneme level. Both total and blended perseverations may result from this mechanism. Word total perseverations may be favoured because of feedback from the phoneme level to the lexical level. Ideas for future research and implications for intervention are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Gestures are {{processed}} {{in the same}} {{areas of the brain}} as speech and sign language such as the left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area) and the posterior middle temporal gyrus, posterior superior temporal sulcus and superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke's area). It has been suggested that these parts of the brain originally supported the pairing of gesture and meaning and then were adapted in human evolution [...] "for the comparable pairing of sound and meaning as voluntary control over the vocal apparatus was established and spoken language evolved". As a result, it underlies both symbolic gesture and spoken language in the present human brain. Their common neurological basis also supports the idea that symbolic gesture and spoken language are two parts of a single fundamental semiotic system that underlies human discourse.The linkage of hand and body gestures in conjunction with speech is further revealed by the nature of gesture use in blind individuals during conversation. This phenomenon uncovers a function of gesture that goes beyond portraying communicative content of language and extends David McNeill's view of the gesture-speech system. This suggests that gesture and speech work tightly together, and a disruption of one (speech or gesture) will cause a problem in the other. Studies have found strong evidence that speech and gesture are innately linked in the brain and work in an efficiently wired and choreographed system. McNeill's view of this linkage in the brain is just one of three currently up for debate; the others declaring gesture to be a [...] "support system" [...] of spoken language or a physical mechanism for <b>lexical</b> <b>retrieval.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{cohort model}} {{consists}} of three stages: access, selection, and integration. [...] Under this model, auditory <b>lexical</b> <b>retrieval</b> begins with the first one or two speech segments, or phonemes, reach the hearer's ear, at which time the mental lexicon activates every possible word that begins with that speech segment. This occurs during the [...] "access stage" [...] {{and all of the}} possible words are known as the cohort. The words that are activated by the speech signal but are not the intended word are often called [...] "competitors." [...] Identification of the target word is more difficult with more competitors. As more speech segments enter the ear and stimulate more neurons, causing the competitors that no longer match the input to be [...] "kicked out" [...] or to decrease in activation. [...] The processes by which words are activated and competitors rejected in the cohort model are frequently called [...] "activation and selection" [...] or [...] "recognition and competition." [...] These processes continue until an instant, called the recognition point, at which only one word remains activated and all competitors have been kicked out. The recognition point process is initiated within the first 200 to 250 milliseconds of the onset of the given word. [...] This is also known as the uniqueness point and it is the point where the most processing occurs. Moreover, there is a difference in the way a word is processed before it reaches its recognition point and afterwards. One can look at the process prior to reaching the recognition point as bottom-up, where the phonemes are used to access the lexicon. The post recognition point process is top-down, because the information concerning the chosen word is tested against the word that is presented. The selection stage occurs when only one word is left from the set. Finally, in the integration stage, the semantic and syntactic properties of activated words are incorporated into the high-level utterance representation.|$|E

The current corpus study uses pronunciation data from conversationally produced English verbs and nouns to test the predictions of two accounts. In an exemplar account, paradigmatically probable forms seem enhanced because their denser exemplar clouds resist influence from related word forms on the average production target. A second pressure reduces such forms because they are, after all, more easily accessed. Under this account, paradigmatically probable forms should have longer affixes but shorter stems.

Nouns produced with the determiner were produced faster and more accurately than their counterparts produced without the determiner.

We know that various sites of web contain aliases of popular celebrity in various field like music, cinema, sport etc., and does not contain alias information about common man. There is one existing methods of extracting aliases through <b>lexical</b> pattern based <b>retrieval</b> tested using real-world name-alias pairs using training data related to limited domains. In this paper, we discuss what are the problem arrive while retrieving the information, and how we should correct alias extraction in Inter-disciplinary fields...|$|R
40|$|Word sense {{disambiguation}} (WSD) is {{a technique}} used to identify the correct sense of polysemous words, and it is useful for many applications, such as machine translation (MT), <b>lexical</b> substitution, information <b>retrieval</b> (IR), and biomedical applications. In this paper, we propose {{the use of multiple}} contextual features, including the predicate-argument structure and named entities, to train two commonly used classifiers, Naïve Bayes (NB) and Maximum Entropy (ME), for word sense disambiguation. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the classifiers’ performance on the OntoNotes corpus and are compared with classifiers trained using a set of baseline features, such as the bag-of-words, n-grams, and part-of-speech (POS) tags. Experimental results show that incorporating both predicate-argument structure and named entities yields higher classification accuracy for both classifiers than does the use of the baseline features, resulting in accuracy as high as 81. 6 % and 87. 4 %, respectively, for NB and ME...|$|R
