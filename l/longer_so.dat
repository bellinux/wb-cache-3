5|$|Napoleon, who {{had been}} well {{respected}} in Egypt and had earned himself the nickname Sultan el-Kebir (the Great Sultan) among the people of Cairo, lost their admiration and was no <b>longer</b> <b>so</b> addressed. In March 1800, French General Jean Baptiste Kléber was assassinated by Suleiman al-Halabi, a student at al-Azhar. Following the assassination, Napoleon ordered {{the closing of the}} mosque; the doors remained bolted until Ottoman and British assistance arrived in August 1801.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} was {{confused by the}} legal position. Disturbing a grave was a criminal offence, as was the taking of property from the deceased. Stealing the body was not an offence, as it did not legally belong to anyone. The price per corpse changed depending on the season. It was £8 during the summer, when the warmer temperatures brought on quicker decomposition, and £10 in the winter months, when the demand by anatomists was greater, because the colder temperatures meant they could store corpses <b>longer</b> <b>so</b> they undertook more dissections.|$|E
5|$|Travelling {{further along}} Durham Road towards Gateshead are two more Grade II listed {{buildings}}. The first is Heathfield House, a two story villa built by John Wardle (designer of St Helen's Church) in 1865 and Musgrave House, an ashlar villa with raised quoins built in 18545 {{which has been}} used as a school but is no <b>longer</b> <b>so.</b> Both buildings are now converted to private flats.|$|E
5|$|A {{good picture}} of the county in 1086 is given by Domesday Book, though there is some {{difficulty}} in identifying the various places since the hundreds are not specified. The total population given for the county, which had different boundaries to those today, was 13,399, however this only included the heads of households, so with their families {{this may have been}} around 67,000. Farming seems to have prospered for the next three centuries but was severely hit by the Black Death which in 1348 arrived in Dorset and quickly spread through Somerset, causing widespread mortality, perhaps as much as 50% in places. It re-occurred, resulting in a change in feudal practices since the manpower was no <b>longer</b> <b>so</b> available.|$|E

5|$|On 9 September 1899, Gan {{died at the}} age of 55 in {{his house}} at No. 87 Amoy Street. His total assets were worth an {{estimated}} S$550,000. He was buried at Leng Kee Sua somewhere on the hill by the side where Leng Kee Road runs today. Due to redevelopment of the area, his body was disinterred and reburied in a family grave at Bukit Brown Cemetery. After the death of his father, Gan Tiang Tok continued the family business for three years, though by the turn of century it was no <b>longer</b> <b>so</b> lucrative. Gan Tiang Tok was dogged by ill health from 1903 until his death in 1927 at the age of 68.|$|E
5|$|With Marais's loans {{combined}} with the Ebden scholarship, Smuts began to enjoy a degree of financial security. Though far from affluent {{he was at least}} able to meet his basic expenses. From his second year onwards Smuts began to enter more into the social arena of the university. He ceased to be lonely, making a number of friends and acquaintances, principally amongst the other colonial students. Though no <b>longer</b> <b>so</b> reclusive as he had been during his first year, he remained extremely serious and devoted to his work; an attitude which served as a barrier separating him from the English undergraduates, though not from the Fellows at Cambridge, with many of whom he struck up friendships.|$|E
5|$|Back at the TARDIS, Jack begins {{integrating}} the extrapolator into the TARDIS {{to speed up}} the engine recharge. Rose and Mickey hang out together, and he admits to her that he is dating someone else because she is not there for him, and he begs her to promise him that she eventually will come back to him in the end, but before she can answer him, loud sounds like thunder start to reverberate through the area. Cardiff is soon struck by a large earthquake that seems to be coming from the Rift. The Doctor, Margaret, Rose and Jack regroup and find that the extrapolator was a trap meant to redirect the energy from the TARDIS into the Rift, rupturing it. Jack and the Doctor are unable to stop the energy transfer, and Margaret takes Rose hostage and demands the extrapolator. The heart of the TARDIS opens on the console, bathing Margaret in light. While she is captivated by the light, Jack and the Doctor close the rift and disable the extrapolator. As the console closes, they find that Margaret's human suit is empty except for a Slitheen egg. The Doctor surmises that the TARDIS sensed that Margaret wanted a second chance at life and gave it to her. The TARDIS crew decides to return the egg to Raxacoricofallapatorius so Margaret can be raised in a different family. Rose realises Mickey has left without saying goodbye, and runs out to look for him in the nearby area, but he is gone. Rose returns to the TARDIS, clearly distraught, and the Doctor offers to wait a little <b>longer</b> <b>so</b> she can search for Mickey, but she declines, saying that he deserves better.|$|E

50|$|As neighborhoods have gentrified, {{holders of}} housing {{vouchers}} {{may find that}} property owners who might have taken their vouchers in the past are no <b>longer</b> doing <b>so.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{development}} of Hurst, Calshot, Cowes and Netley castles along Southampton Water and the Solent, by Henry VIII in about 1540, meant that Southampton was no <b>longer</b> <b>so</b> dependent upon its fortifications.|$|E
25|$|Lineside {{light signals}} are also {{provided}} {{in case of}} HKT failures or the occasional visit of a non-S-train, but the lineside blocks are <b>longer</b> <b>so</b> capacity in this mode is reduced. Precise train positions are visible on all lines in Byens puls (see links below).|$|E
25|$|Once Xiang {{was elected}} {{paramount}} {{leader of the}} CCP, it was inappropriate for {{him to stay in}} Moscow any <b>longer.</b> <b>So</b> Xiang came back to Shanghai to oversee the daily work of the CCP headquarters, assisted by new members of politburo Cai Hesen and alternate member Li Lisan.|$|E

25|$|The Plot is no <b>longer</b> <b>so</b> heavily {{dominated}} by GE employees, {{due to the}} company's greatly reduced presence in the city. Houses in it remain highly valued, and residents pay some of the Capital District region's highest property taxes. Rules enforced by both the neighborhood association and the city's Historic Commission preserve its historic character.|$|E
25|$|Compared with {{domestic}} cattle, the rumen of yaks is unusually large, {{relative to the}} omasum. This likely allows them to consume greater quantities of low-quality food at a time, and to ferment it <b>longer</b> <b>so</b> as to extract more nutrients. Yak consume the equivalent of 1% of their body weight daily while cattle require 3% to maintain condition.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} the {{boundaries}} of 1914, Germany in 1700 had a population of 16 million, increasing slightly to 17 million by 1750, and growing more rapidly to 24 million by 1800. Wars continued, but they were no <b>longer</b> <b>so</b> devastating to the civilian population; famines and major epidemics did not occur, but increased agricultural productivity led to a higher birth rate, and a lower death rate.|$|E
5000|$|... prefix 8Z {{used to be}} {{used for}} the Iraq/Saudi Neutral Zone (8Z4) and the Kuwait/Saudi Neutral Zone (8Z5), both of which no <b>longer</b> exist <b>so</b> the prefixes were withdrawn.|$|R

50|$|In 1986, Tang {{became famous}} for his novel, Zeng Guofan. In 2002, Tang {{published}} the novel Zhang Zhidong. He no <b>longer</b> writes, <b>so</b> this book has become his last novel.|$|R
25|$|Once early farmers perfected their {{agricultural}} techniques like irrigation, {{their crops}} would yield surpluses that needed storage. Most hunter gatherers could not easily store food for long {{due to their}} migratory lifestyle, whereas those with a sedentary dwelling could store their surplus grain. Eventually granaries were developed that allowed villages to store their seeds <b>longer.</b> <b>So</b> with more food, the population expanded and communities developed specialized workers and more advanced tools.|$|E
25|$|The design also {{requires}} {{the use of}} slightly enriched uranium, enriched by about 1 or 2%. The main reason for this is to increase the burn-up ratio, allowing bundles to remain in the reactor <b>longer,</b> <b>so</b> that only a third as much spent fuel is produced. This also has effects on operational costs and timetables, as the refuelling frequency is reduced. As is the case with earlier CANDU designs, the ACR-1000 also offers online refuelling.|$|E
25|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, modernismo emerged, a poetic {{movement}} whose founding text was Nicaraguan poet Rubén Darío's Azul (1888). This was the first Latin American literary movement to influence literary culture outside of the region, and was also the first truly Latin American literature, in that national differences were no <b>longer</b> <b>so</b> much at issue. José Martí, for instance, though a Cuban patriot, also lived in Mexico and the United States and wrote for journals in Argentina and elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|Ridden by Stewart Elliott, Teuflesberg placed 17th in the Kentucky Derby. This result led {{to doubt}} that he could run for <b>longer</b> distances, <b>so</b> he was moved to shorter races.|$|R
50|$|The project {{now also}} {{provides}} training courses, funding advice {{and support to}} small organisations. Historically the LCDP provided small grants through the Community Chest scheme, but no <b>longer</b> does <b>so.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} isotope americium-241 decays (half-life of 431 years) to neptunium-237 {{which has a}} much <b>longer</b> half-life, <b>so</b> in the long term, the issues {{discussed}} above for neptunium apply.|$|R
