25|$|John's son, Sir Thomas Wolryche (1672–1701) {{inherited}} his uncle's baronetcy and his father's {{determination to}} rebuild. However, he {{embarked on a}} much more ambitious project, replacing the old manor house with a new sandstone building, {{the core of the}} present Dudmaston Hall. The architect appears to have been Francis Smith of Warwick, who provided a substantial, well-built, but not grand residence. Modelled on Belton House in Lincolnshire, it has an H-plan <b>lay-out,</b> a large central entrance hall, backed by a saloon, and flanked by three-roomed wings. Construction probably began before 1700, but Thomas died in 1701 before it was complete.|$|E
25|$|Ritual was governed {{not only}} by the {{geographical}} <b>lay-out</b> of shrines and temples, but also by the projection of calendrical models onto the landscape. In contemporary Quichean Momostenango, for example, specific combinations of day-names and numbers are ascribed to specialized shrines in the mountains, signalling the appropriate times for their ritual use. In the northwestern Maya highlands, the four days, or 'Day Lords', that can start a year are assigned to four mountains. In early-colonial Yucatán, the thirteen katun periods and their deities, mapped onto a landscape conceived as a 'wheel', are said to be successively 'established' in specific towns.|$|E

25|$|In the {{following}} centuries, Klagenfurt suffered fires, earthquakes, invasions of locusts, and attacks from Turks, and was ravaged by the Peasants' Wars. In 1514, a fire almost completely destroyed the city, and in 1518 Emperor Maximilian I, unable to rebuild it, despite the loud protests of the burgers, ceded Klagenfurt to the Estates, the nobility of the Duchy. Never before {{had such a}} thing happened. The new owners, however, brought about an economic renaissance and the political and cultural ascendancy of Klagenfurt. A canal was dug to connect {{the city to the}} lake as a supply route for timber to rebuild the city and to feed the city's new moats; the noble families had their town houses built in the duchy's new capital, the city was enlarged along a geometrical chequer-board <b>lay-out</b> according to the Renaissance ideas of the Italian architect Domenico dell'Allio; a new city centre square, the Neuer Platz, was constructed; and the new fortifications that took half a century to build made Klagenfurt the strongest fortress north of the Alps.|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{personal}} nature of bullying, {{as well as the}} act itself not being considered as serious a crime as sexual assault, published media reports of bullying in the Boy Scouts were generally unknown by the public with some rare exceptions. [...] One of the more widely published accounts of Boy Scout bullying occurred in July 1987 when a Boy Scout at the Goshen Scout Reservation was severally beaten in his sleep by several other Scouts. [...] The incident resulted in the Goshen staff changing the <b>lay-out</b> of its camp sites, to prevent having sites in extremely isolated areas, as well as assigning camp staff members to each visiting troop as [...] "advisors" [...] and also to watch for fights or other trouble resulting from conflicts developing at the various camp-sites.|$|E

500|$|David Rhind (1808–83) {{employed}} both neoclassical and Baronial {{styles and}} his work included many branches of the Commercial Bank of Scotland, among them their headquarters in Edinburgh. He also designed a number of churches, local government buildings, and houses. One of his grandest schemes was Daniel Stewart's Hospital, now Stewart's Melville College, Edinburgh. In 1849, he was commissioned to design the <b>lay-out</b> of the Pollokshields area of Glasgow, in what until then had been farmland [...] {{south of the city}} centre. Rhind formed a partnership with Robert Hamilton Paterson (1843–1911) who executed major works for brewers, malters and warehouse-men (for which Edinburgh was a centre), including design of the Abbey, James Calder & Co., Castle, Holyrood, Drybrough's, Caledonian and Clydesdale Breweries; and also work for McVitie and Price. The partnership was to execute important projects such as the Queen Victoria Memorial at Liverpool and the Royal Scots War Memorial in St Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh.|$|E
500|$|Post-production {{lasted for}} {{fourteen}} months. Because {{the film was}} made before computer animation and digital compositing were widely used, all the animation was done using cels and optical compositing. First, the animators and <b>lay-out</b> artists were given black and white printouts of the live action scenes (known as [...] "photo stats"), and they placed their animation paper on top of them. The artists then drew the animated characters {{in relationship to the}} live action footage. Due to Zemeckis' dynamic camera moves, the animators had to confront the challenge of ensuring the characters were not [...] "slipping and slipping all over the place." [...] After rough animation was complete, it would run through the normal process of traditional animation until the cels were shot on the rostrum camera with no background. The animated footage was then sent to ILM for compositing, where technicians would animate three lighting layers (shadows, highlights and tone mattes) separately, {{in order to make the}} cartoon characters look three-dimensional and give the illusion of the characters being affected by the lighting on set. Finally, the lighting effects were optically composited on to the cartoon characters, who were, in turn, composited into the live-action footage. One of the most difficult effects in the film was Jessica's dress in the night club scene, because it had flashing sequins, an effect accomplished by filtering light through a plastic bag scratched with steel wool.|$|E

2500|$|These attacks led {{to calls}} for {{strengthened}} AA defence for the naval bases at Scapa Flow, Invergordon, Rosyth and the Clyde anchorage, and 3 AA Division was given priority for new guns. Starting in January 1940, the division was to receive 64 3.7-inch and 32 4.5-inch HAA guns and an increase to 100 searchlights, but only 10 Bofors and some Naval 2-pounders were available for LAA defence. 3 AA Division had many problems at Scapa, where a chain of rugged islands enclose an extensive area of water, which stretched {{beyond the reach of}} HAA fire from the islands. Installing gun positions on the islands required an immense amount of labour. A new Luftwaffe attack on 16 March 1940 caught the defences half-prepared: only 52 out of 64 HAA guns were fit for action, and 30 out of 108 SLs. About 15 Junkers Ju 88s approached at low level in the dusk: half dived on the [...] warships and the rest attacked the airfield. 44 HAA guns of 42 AA Bde engaged, but their predictors were defeated by erratic curses and low height. 17 LAA guns also engaged, but the Gun layers were blinded by gun-flashes in the half light.

2500|$|Brazil had {{coastal cities}} and towns, {{which have been}} {{considered}} far less important than colonial settlements in Spanish America, but like Spanish America, urban settlements were important as the sites of institutional life of church and state, as well as urban groups of merchants. [...] Unlike many areas of Spanish America, there was no dense, sedentary indigenous population which had already created settlements, but cities and towns in Brazil {{were similar to those}} in Spanish Colonial Venezuela. [...] Port cities allowed Portuguese trade goods to enter, including African slaves, and export goods of sugar and later gold and coffee to be exported to Portugal and beyond. Coastal cities of Olinda (founded 1537), Salvador da Bahia (1549), Santos (1545), Vitória (1551), and Rio de Janeiro (1565) were also vital in the defense against pirates. Only São Paulo in Minas Gerais was an important inland city. [...] Unlike the network of towns and cities that developed in most areas of Spanish America, the coastal cities and their hinterlands were oriented toward Portugal directly with little connection otherwise. [...] With sugar as the major export commodity in the early period and the necessity to process cane into exportable refined sugar on-site, the sugar engenhos had resident artisans and barber-surgeons, and functioned in some ways as small towns. Also unlike most Spanish settlements, Brazilian cities and towns did not have a uniform <b>lay-out</b> of central plaza and a check board pattern of streets, often because the topography defeated such an orderly layout.|$|E
