500|$|Although {{almost every}} story that {{appeared}} in Planet {{could be described as}} space opera, there was some variety of approach to the basic themes. [...] Earth was sometimes threatened, but more often the action took place on other worlds, bringing Earthmen into local conflicts. [...] This often involved beautiful native princesses, though the romantic storylines were stereotyped: in one story which appeared in Fall 1940, Carl Selwyn's [...] "Venus Has Green Eyes", the Venusian princess is dissuaded from her hatred of humans when the hero seizes her and kisses her; she slaps him, but succumbs to his charm. [...] Some respite from these depictions of women was provided by Leigh Brackett, who described her own heroines as [...] "usually on the bitchy sidewarm-blooded, hot-tempered, but gutty and intelligent" [...] (with [...] "bitchy" [...] intended as a compliment). [...] During World War II, it was in Planet Stories that a reader was most likely to come across a female character who could fight, instead of merely being fought over. [...] Sex itself had long been taboo in the pulp magazines, but some stories in Planet depicted sexuality more directly than the competing magazines would. [...] The readers were not always accepting; one reader in a letter in 1949 supported [...] "jettisoning the taboos", but a letter writer in 1946 objected to [...] "Lorelei of the Red Mist", saying that he needed [...] "a pint of <b>Listerine</b> to wash the dirty taste out of my mouth". [...] The cover artwork generally emphasized sex as well, with what sf author and critic Harry Harrison sardonically referred to as [...] "sexual dimorphism in space": heavy, functional spacesuits for the men, and transparent suits through which bikinis or swimsuits could be seen for the women.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{this success}} of [...] "Vaya con Dios", in 1953 the couple started to host The Les Paul and Mary Ford Show, their own daily {{television}} program broadcast from their Mahwah home. The show, which was five minutes long and sponsored by <b>Listerine,</b> ran from 1953-60 on NBC {{television and in}} syndication. In early 1955, rock and roll came along and eventually threatened the popularity of many performers including Paul and Ford. In 1955, they gave a concert at Carnegie Hall, and in 1956, the couple performed at the Eisenhower White House.|$|E
2500|$|San Francisco public {{relations}} firm Fineman Associates awarded top prize to Procter & Gamble's designation of O'Donnell as [...] "unkissable" [...] in a promotion for Scope mouthwash on the 1997 annual list of the nation's worst {{public relations}} blunders. In response to the promotion, O'Donnell partnered with Warner–Lambert's competitor <b>Listerine</b> who donated bottles of mouthwash to the studio audience and donated $1,000 to charity every time a hosted guest would kiss her in exchange for O'Donnell promoting their product. On occasion, the guests would offer multiple kisses and People reported O'Donnell [...] "smooched her way to more than $350,000." ...|$|E
5000|$|Tarzan's yell {{is used as}} a melodic refrain in the Baltimora single [...] "Tarzan Boy". This refrain {{ironically}} {{plays in}} place of an ordinary Tarzan yell when Haru climbs and struggles to keep his balance {{on the top of a}} palm tree in Beverly Hills Ninja. The refrain was also used in a 1993 jungle-themed advert for <b>Listerine's</b> Cool Mint mouthwash.|$|R

6000|$|She had an aunt who {{behaved like}} {{a mother and a}} mother who behaved like a genteel visitor, and they both agreed with Amanda that {{although}} Mr. Walter Long and his dreadful muzzles and everything did seem to have stamped out rabies, yet you couldn't be too careful with a dog bite. A dog bite might be injurious in all sorts of ways--particularly Sultan's bite. He was, they had to confess, a dog without refinement, a coarse-minded omnivorous dog. Both the elder ladies insisted upon regarding Benham's wound as clear evidence of some gallant rescue of Amanda from imminent danger--"she's always so RECKLESS with those dogs," [...] as though Amanda was not manifestly capable of taking care of herself; and when he had been <b>Listerined</b> and bandaged, they would have it that he should join them at their supper-dinner, which was already prepared and waiting. They treated {{him as if he were}} still an undergraduate, they took his arrangements in hand as though he was a favourite nephew. He must stay in Harting that night. Both the Ship and the Coach and Horses were excellent inns, and over the Downs there would be nothing for miles and miles....|$|R
2500|$|The show also {{appeared}} on television {{a few years}} later with the same format, but excluding the trio and retitled The Les Paul & Mary Ford Show (also known as Les Paul & Mary Ford at Home) with [...] "Vaya Con Dios" [...] as the theme song. Sponsored by Warner Lambert's <b>Listerine</b> mouthwash, it was aired on NBC television during 1954–1955, and then syndicated until 1960. The show aired five times a day, five days a week for only five minutes (one or two songs) long, and therefore was used as a brief interlude or fill-in in programming schedules. Since Paul created the entire show himself, including audio and video, he maintained the original recordings and {{was in the process of}} restoring them to current quality standards until his death.|$|E
2500|$|On June 26, 2006, Pfizer {{announced}} it would sell its Consumer Healthcare unit (manufacturer of <b>Listerine,</b> Nicorette, Visine, Sudafed and Neosporin) to Johnson & Johnson for $16.6billion. Development of torcetrapib, a drug that increases production of HDL, or [...] "good cholesterol", which reduces LDL thought to be correlated to heart disease, was cancelled in December 2006. During a Phase III clinical trial involving 15,000 patients, more deaths occurred in the group that took the medicine than expected, and a sixty percent increase in mortality was seen among patients taking the combination of torcetrapib and Lipitor versus Lipitor alone. Lipitor alone was not implicated in the results, but Pfizer lost nearly $1billion developing the failed drug and {{the market value of}} the company plummeted afterwards. The company also {{announced it}} would acquire Powermed and Rivax.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, it is alleged that {{products}} such as mouthwash or breath spray can [...] "fool" [...] breath machines by significantly raising test results. [...] <b>Listerine</b> mouthwash, for example, contains 27% alcohol. The breath machine is calibrated {{with the assumption that}} the alcohol is coming from alcohol in the blood diffusing into the lung rather than directly from the mouth, so it applies a partition ratio of 2100:1 in computing blood alcohol concentration—resulting in a false high test reading. To counter this, officers are not supposed to administer a preliminary breath test for 15 minutes after the subject eats, vomits, or puts anything in their mouth. In addition, most instruments require that the individual be tested twice at least two minutes apart. Mouthwash or other mouth alcohol will have somewhat dissipated after two minutes and cause the second reading to disagree with the first, requiring a retest.

In 1995, FreshBurst was added, then in 2003 Natural Citrus. In 2006 a new addition to the [...] "less intense" [...] variety, Vanilla Mint, was released. Nine different kinds of <b>Listerine</b> are on the market in the U.S. and elsewhere: Original, Cool Mint, FreshBurst, Natural Citrus, Naturals, Soft Mint (Vanilla Mint), UltraClean (formerly Advanced <b>Listerine),</b> Tooth Defense (mint shield), and Whitening pre-brush rinse (clean mint).|$|E
5000|$|From 1921 {{until the}} mid-1970s, <b>Listerine</b> was also marketed as {{preventive}} and remedy for colds and sore throats. In 1976, the Federal Trade Commission ruled that these claims were misleading, and that <b>Listerine</b> had [...] "no efficacy" [...] at either preventing or alleviating {{the symptoms of}} sore throats and colds. Warner-Lambert was ordered to stop making the claims, and {{to include in the}} next $10.2 million worth of <b>Listerine</b> ads specific mention that [...] "Listerine will not help prevent colds or sore throats or lessen their severity." [...] The advertisement run by <b>Listerine</b> added the preamble [...] "contrary to prior advertising".|$|E

5000|$|Lawrence {{hoped to}} promote Listerine's {{use as a}} general {{germicide}} {{as well as a}} surgical antiseptic, and licensed his formula to a local pharmacist named Jordan Wheat Lambert in 1881.

5000|$|The word {{halitosis}} {{is derived}} from the Latin word halitus, meaning 'breath', and the Greek suffix -osis meaning 'diseased' or 'a condition of'. With modern consumerism, there has been a complex interplay of advertising pressures and the existing evolutionary aversion to malodor. Contrary to the popular belief that <b>Listerine</b> coined the term halitosis, its origins date to before the product's existence, being coined by physician Joseph William Howe in his 1874 book The Breath, and the Diseases Which Give It a Fetid Odor, although it only became commonly used in the 1920s when a marketing campaign promoted <b>Listerine</b> as a solution for [...] "chronic halitosis". The company was the first to manufacture mouth washes in the United States. According to Freakonomics: <b>Listerine</b> [...] "...was invented in the nineteenth century as powerful surgical antiseptic. It was later sold, in distilled form, as both a floor cleaner and a cure for gonorrhea. But it wasn't a runaway success until the 1920s, when it was pitched as a solution for [...] "chronic halitosis"— a then obscure medical term for bad breath. Listerine's new ads featured forlorn young women and men, eager for marriage but turned off by their mate's rotten breath. [...] "Can I be happy with him in spite of that?" [...] one maiden asked herself. Until that time, bad breath was not conventionally considered such a catastrophe, but <b>Listerine</b> changed that. As the advertising scholar James B. Twitchell writes, [...] "Listerine did not make mouthwash as much as it made halitosis." [...] In just seven years, the company's revenues rose from $115,000 to more than $8 million." ...|$|E
