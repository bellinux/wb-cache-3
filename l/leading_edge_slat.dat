The wing consists of two cantilever sections attached to a central torsion box, forming a single unit with the fuselage. The air brakes are housed in fairings {{at the tip of}} each wing. Each wing has five hardpoints for weapons carriage, with the attachment points mounted on load-bearing ribs and spars. Each wing also features a five-section <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat,</b> a two-section flap and an aileron.|$|E

5000|$|Slat and slot: A <b>Leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> {{is a small}} {{aerofoil}} extending {{in front}} of the main leading edge. The spanwise gap behind it forms a leading-edge slot. Air flowing up through the slot is deflected backwards by the slat to flow over the wing, allowing the aircraft to fly at lower air speeds without flow separation or stalling. A slat may be fixed or retractable.|$|E

50|$|Only {{the upper}} wing carried control surfaces, {{with a single}} <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> over the whole span. Apart from a small centre section with a large cut-out to improve the {{visibility}} from the pilot's cockpit, {{the whole of the}} trailing edge was filled by flaps inboard and ailerons outboard. When the slats were opened by the pilot, ailerons and flaps were depressed but retained their normal functions with unchanged angular defection ranges.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> is an {{aerodynamic}} surface running spanwise {{just ahead of}} the wing leading edge. It creates a leading edge slot between the slat and wing which directs air over the wing surface, helping to maintain smooth airflow at low speeds and high angles of attack. This delays the stall, allowing the aircraft to fly at a higher angle of attack. Slats may be made fixed, or retractable in normal flight to minimize drag.|$|E
50|$|Handley Page {{developed}} the Handley Page Slat (or slot, see slats), an auxiliary airfoil mounted ahead {{and over the}} main wing, which formed a narrow opening running along {{the leading edge of}} the wing to improve airflow at high angles of attack. The <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> was simultaneously designed by the German aerodynamicist Gustav Lachmann, who was later employed by Handley Page. The design was so successful that licensing fees to other companies was their main source of income in the early 1920s.|$|E

50|$|The digital FBW {{system of}} the Tejas employs a {{powerful}} digital flight control computer (DFCC) made by Aeronautical Development Establishment (ADE) comprising four computing channels, {{each with its own}} independent power supply and all housed in a single LRU. The DFCC receives signals from a variety of sensors and pilot control stick inputs, and processes these through the appropriate channels to excite and control the elevons, rudder and <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> hydraulic actuators. The DFCC channels are built around 32-bit microprocessors and use a subset of the Ada programming language for software implementation. The computer interfaces with pilot display elements like the MFDs through MIL-STD-1553B multiplex avionics data buses and RS-422 serial links.

50|$|The {{cause of}} the crash was {{determined}} to be a stall caused by the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slats</b> (strictly speaking, Krueger flaps) having been left in the retracted position. Even though the trailing edge flaps were deployed, without the slats being extended the aircraft's stall speed was higher and the maximum angle of attack was lower. As a result, the aircraft was unable to climb out of ground effect. The flight engineer was found to have failed to open the slat system bleed air valves as required on the pre-flight checklist. This prevented bleed air from flowing to the 747's pneumatic slat system and, since the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slats</b> on the 747 are pneumatically driven, kept it from deploying the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slats</b> for takeoff. The take-off warning system that would have sounded an alarm due to the flaps not being lowered did not have a separate warning that the slats' pneumatic valve had not been opened by the flight engineer.|$|R
50|$|The crew {{suggested}} {{instead that}} an actuator on the #7 slat had failed, causing its inadvertent deployment. The NTSB rejected this as improbable and attributed {{the extension of}} the flaps to the deliberate actions of the crew. The crew claimed that such failures had happened on other 727s prior and subsequent to this incident. The NTSB report noted that between 1970 and 1973, seven separate cases involving a single <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> extension and separation were reported, but none of these reports indicated whether or not the slat extension was due to flight crew involvement. Records after 1974 did include this information, and (other than Flight 174) only two slat extension problems were reported between 1974 and the close of the NTSB's investigation in 1981, one of which was inadvertently caused by the flight crew.|$|E
50|$|On 15 January 1943, the {{prototype}} CA-4, A23-1001, crashed {{on a test}} flight to assess powerplant performance and evaluate aerodynamic effects of a new fixed <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat.</b> During the return to the CAC airfield at Fisherman's Bend, the pilot, Squadron Leader Jim Harper, had detected a fuel leak in the port Pratt & Whitney R-1830 engine. As the problem worsened he attempted {{to shut down the}} engine, feathering the propeller; however, the actuation of the feathering switch caused an explosion and uncontrollable fire. The three man crew subsequently attempted evacuation at 1000 ft, yet only Harper succeeded in parachuting free, while the CAC test pilot Jim Carter and power plant group engineer Lionel Dudgeon were both killed. The airframe subsequently impacted 3 mi south-west of Kilmore, Victoria. The wreckage was recovered and used for components.|$|E
5000|$|The {{flight crew}} testified {{that they had}} not engaged the flaps, and the NTSB {{concluded}} that [...] "if the flightcrew's recollections are accurate," [...] the slat extension must have been caused by a mechanical failure or defect. However, the NTSB ultimately concluded that the flight crew was probably attempting to use 2º of flaps at cruising speed: While cruising at Mach 0.816 and 39,000 feet pressure altitude and with the autopilot controlling the aircraft, an attempt was made to extend 2º of trailing edge flaps independently of the leading edge slats, probably in an effort to improve aircraft performance When retraction of the flaps was ordered, the Number 7 <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> failed to retract, causing the uncommanded roll to the right. The Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the isolation of the No. 7 <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> in the fully or partially extended position after an extension of the Nos. 2, 3, 6, and 7 leading edge slats and the subsequent retraction of the Nos. 2, 3, and 6 slats, and the captain's untimely flight control inputs to counter the roll resulting from the slat asymmetry. Contributing to the cause was a preexisting misalignment of the No. 7 slat which, when combined with the cruise condition airloads, precluded retraction of that slat. After eliminating all probable individual or combined mechanical failures, or malfunctions which could lead to slat extension, the Safety Board determined that the extension of the slats {{was the result of the}} flightcrew's manipulation of the flap/slat controls. Contributing to the captain's untimely use of the flight controls was distraction due probably to his efforts to rectify the source of the control problem. [...] Captain Gibson appealed the NTSB's findings, first to the NTSB itself, and then to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Both petitions were rejected: the former for lack of new evidence, and the latter for lack of jurisdiction due to the NTSB's [...] "unreviewable discretion".|$|E

2500|$|Development of the Pegazair {{started in}} 1985 by Serg Dufour of Mont-Saint-Michel, Quebec. Originally it {{consisted}} of {{a new set of}} Pega-STOL wings with retractable <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slats</b> to be installed on Zenair CH 701 STOLs to replace their wings which have fixed <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> slots. Dufour went on to develop a new fuselage and tail to match the wings. The Pegazair is a two seats in side-by-side configuration, strut-braced, high-wing monoplane with conventional landing gear. Fuselage construction is welded steel tubing with aluminum skin. The wings employ full length flaperons and <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slats</b> that deploy automatically. The tailplane is slotted for slow speed authority. The prototype was outfitted with a [...] Continental A-65 engine.|$|R
50|$|The digital FBW {{system of}} the {{aircraft}} employs an advance next-generation distributed digital flight control computer (DDFCC) made by ADE comprising four computing channels, {{each with its own}} independent power supply and all housed in differently placed LRU. The DFCC receives signals from a variety of sensors and pilot control stick inputs, and processes these through the appropriate channels to excite and control the elevons, rudder and <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> hydraulic actuators. DFCC provides raising the wing flaps and ailerons on one side and lowering them on the other provided roll. The Pelikan-tail fins are angled at 27 degrees from the vertical. Pitch is mainly provided by rotating these pelikan-tail fins in opposite directions so their front edges moved together or apart. Yaw is primarily supplied by rotating the tail fins in the same direction. The AMCA is designed for superior high Angle of attack (AoA) performance. Deflecting the wing flaps down and ailerons up on both sides simultaneously provided for Aerodynamic braking.|$|E
5000|$|The DC-10 was {{involved}} in another deadly crash on May 25, 1979, when American Airlines flight 191, departing Chicago's O'Hare Airport, went out of control immediately after takeoff. [...] As the airliner rotated during its takeoff roll, the number one (left wing) engine and pylon assembly separated from and swung upward {{over the top of}} the wing, severing critical hydraulic lines embedded in the wing's leading edge, as well as tearing away part of the wing structure. The loss of hydraulic pressure to the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> actuators caused the slats to retract due to aerodynamic forces, increasing the left wing's stall speed above the engine failure climb out speed being used by the pilots. With the left wing stalled and further destabilized by asymmetric thrust, the DC-10 rapidly rolled to the left, sharply descended and crashed, killing all 271 people on board with two individuals on the ground. [...] The loss of flight 191 remains the deadliest plane crash in U.S. history.|$|E
50|$|Walker {{graduated}} from the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland and subsequently received flight training from the Naval Air Training Command at bases in Florida, Mississippi, and Texas. He was designated a Naval Aviator in December 1967 and proceeded to Naval Air Station Miramar, California, for assignment to F-4 Phantoms aboard the aircraft carriers USS Enterprise and USS America. From December 1970 to 1971, he attended the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California, and was subsequently assigned in January 1972 as an experimental and engineering test pilot in the flight test division at the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School, NAS Patuxent River, Maryland. While there, he participated in the Navy’s preliminary evaluation and Board of Inspection and Survey trials of the F-14 Tomcat and tested a <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> modification to the F-4 Phantom. He then attended the United States Navy Safety Officer School at Monterey, California, and completed replacement pilot training in the F-14 Tomcat at NAS Miramar, California. In 1975, Walker was assigned to Fighter Squadron 142 (VF-142), stationed at NAS Oceana, Virginia, as a fighter pilot and was deployed to the Mediterranean Sea twice aboard the USS America.|$|E

5000|$|The {{findings}} of the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board were released on December 21, 1979: The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the asymmetrical stall and the ensuing roll of the aircraft because of the uncommanded retraction of the left wing outboard leading edge slats and the loss of stall warning and slat disagreement indication systems resulting from maintenance-induced damage leading to the separation of the No. 1 engine and pylon assembly at a critical point during takeoff. The separation resulted from damage by improper maintenance procedures which led to failure of the pylon structure.Contributing to the cause of the accident were the vulnerability of the design of the pylon attach points to maintenance damage; the vulnerability of the design of the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> system to the damage which produced asymmetry; deficiencies in Federal Aviation Administration surveillance and reporting systems which failed to detect and prevent the use of improper maintenance procedures; deficiencies in the practices and communications among the operators, the manufacturer, and the FAA which failed to determine and disseminate the particulars regarding previous maintenance damage incidents; and the intolerance of prescribed operational procedures to this unique emergency.|$|E
