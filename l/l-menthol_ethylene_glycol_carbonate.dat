For all experiments, the liquefaction was conducted at 160 C and atmospheric pressure. The mass ratio of feedstock to liquefaction solvents used in all the experiments was 30 : 100.

A slight increase in the average particle size with a negligible prolongation of the 5 -FU release was observed after 1 F 2 coupling.
