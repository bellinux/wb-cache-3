5|$|The {{mechanism}} that {{is thought to}} have a significant influence on delayed effects involves formed blood cells and chemical mediators, which cause brain <b>lipid</b> <b>peroxidation</b> (degradation of unsaturated fatty acids). Carbon monoxide causes endothelial cell and platelet release of nitric oxide, and the formation of oxygen free radicals including peroxynitrite. In the brain this causes further mitochondrial dysfunction, capillary leakage, leukocyte sequestration, and apoptosis. The result of these effects is <b>lipid</b> <b>peroxidation,</b> which causes delayed reversible demyelinization of white matter in the central nervous system known as Grinker myelinopathy, which can lead to edema and necrosis within the brain. This brain damage occurs mainly during the recovery period. This may result in cognitive defects, especially affecting memory and learning, and movement disorders. These disorders are typically related to damage to the cerebral white matter and basal ganglia. Hallmark pathological changes following poisoning are bilateral necrosis of the white matter, globus pallidus, cerebellum, hippocampus and the cerebral cortex.|$|E

The aim of the present experi- ment was to investigate the effect of Astaxanthin deposition on the <b>lipids</b> <b>peroxidation</b> by studying the Malondialdeide (MDA) level in muscle of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The Astaxanthin concentrations in fish fed with a commercial sources as Lucantin®Pink (BASF Ludwigshafen, Ger- many) reached values to 5. 76 ± 0. 18 x 10 - 3 mg/g after 50 days feeding, while the MDA concentration de- creased from 1. 56 x 103 to 0. 45 x 103 ng/g.

Although some studies in animal models reported no damage to DA nerve endings in the striatum and no {{significant changes in}} brain monoamine levels, some others suggested a rapid reduction in 5-HT and DA transporter function. Persistent serotonergic deficits were observed after binge like treatment in a warm environment and in both serotonergic and dopaminergic nerve endings at high ambient temperature.

5|$|Antioxidants are {{classified}} into two broad divisions, {{depending on whether}} they are soluble in water (hydrophilic) or in lipids (lipophilic). In general, water-soluble antioxidants react with oxidants in the cell cytosol and the blood plasma, while lipid-soluble antioxidants protect cell membranes from <b>lipid</b> <b>peroxidation.</b> These compounds may be synthesized in the body or obtained from the diet. The different antioxidants are present at {{a wide range of}} concentrations in body fluids and tissues, with some such as glutathione or ubiquinone mostly present within cells, while others such as uric acid are more evenly distributed (see table below). Some antioxidants are only found in a few organisms and these compounds can be important in pathogens and can be virulence factors.|$|E

40|$|The {{toxicity}} {{mechanisms of}} mercury and tin organic derivatives {{are still under}} debate. Generally the presence of organic moieties in their molecules makes these compounds lipophilic and membrane active species. The recent results suggest that Hg and Sn compounds deplete HS-groups in proteins, glutathione and glutathione-dependent enzymatic systems; this process also results {{in the production of}} reactive oxygen species (ROS), the enhancement of membrane <b>lipids</b> <b>peroxidation</b> and damage of the antioxidative defence system. The goal of this review is to present recent results in the studies oriented towards the role of organomercury and organotin compounds in the xenobiotic-mediated enhancement of radical production and hence in the promotion of cell damage as a result of enhanced <b>lipids</b> <b>peroxidation.</b> Moreover the conception of the carbon to metal bond cleavage that leads to the generation of reactive organic radicals is discussed as one of the mechanisms of mercury and tin organic derivatives toxicity. The possible use of natural and synthetic antioxidants as detoxification agents is described. The data collected recently and presented here are fundamentally important to recognizing the difference between the role of metal center and of organic fragments in the biochemical behavior of organomercury and organotin compounds in their interaction wit...|$|R

5|$|It {{has been}} {{claimed that the}} α-tocopherol form is the most {{important}} lipid-soluble antioxidant, and that it protects membranes from oxidation by reacting with lipid radicals produced in the <b>lipid</b> <b>peroxidation</b> chain reaction. This removes the free radical intermediates and prevents the propagation reaction from continuing. This reaction produces oxidised α-tocopheroxyl radicals that can be recycled back to the active reduced form through reduction by other antioxidants, such as ascorbate, retinol or ubiquinol. This is in line with findings showing that α-tocopherol, but not water-soluble antioxidants, efficiently protects glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4)-deficient cells from cell death. GPx4 is the only known enzyme that efficiently reduces lipid-hydroperoxides within biological membranes.|$|E
5|$|The {{reactive}} {{oxygen species}} produced in cells include hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hypochlorous acid (HClO), and free radicals such as the hydroxyl radical (·OH) and the superoxide anion (O2−). The hydroxyl radical is particularly unstable and will react rapidly and non-specifically with most biological molecules. This species is produced from hydrogen peroxide in metal-catalyzed redox reactions such as the Fenton reaction. These oxidants can damage cells by starting chemical chain reactions such as <b>lipid</b> <b>peroxidation,</b> or by oxidizing DNA or proteins. Damage to DNA can cause mutations and possibly cancer, if not reversed by DNA repair mechanisms, while damage to proteins causes enzyme inhibition, denaturation and protein degradation.|$|E
5|$|While all the {{reaction}} mechanisms {{of these species}} within the body are not yet fully understood, {{one of the most}} reactive products of oxidative stress is the hydroxyl radical (·OH), which can initiate a damaging chain reaction of <b>lipid</b> <b>peroxidation</b> in the unsaturated lipids within cell membranes. High concentrations of oxygen also increase the formation of other free radicals, such as nitric oxide, peroxynitrite, and trioxidane, which harm DNA and other biomolecules. Although the body has many antioxidant systems such as glutathione that guard against oxidative stress, these systems are eventually overwhelmed at very high concentrations of free oxygen, and the rate of cell damage exceeds the capacity of the systems that prevent or repair it. Cell damage and cell death then result.|$|E
40|$|A {{considerable}} {{decrease of}} constitutive NO-syntase activity (cNOS) in blood thrombocytes {{of patients with}} idiopathic pulmonary hypertension (IPH) is shown. This is the evidence of a decrease of NO synthesis with vaso-dilating properties and an increase of inducible NO-syntase activity (iNOS), that is accompanied by increase of the pool of nitrate-anions (NO– 3) and promotes the activation of <b>lipids</b> <b>peroxidation.</b> Activity of Ca 2 + — dependent cNOS in blood thrombocytes of patients with IPH increases, and the part of NO– 2 of the stable metabolites pool increases under treatment with diltiazem.

5|$|Early {{research}} {{on the role of}} antioxidants in biology focused on their use in preventing the oxidation of unsaturated fats, which is the cause of rancidity. Antioxidant activity could be measured simply by placing the fat in a closed container with oxygen and measuring the rate of oxygen consumption. However, it was the identification of vitamins A, C, and E as antioxidants that revolutionized the field and led to the realization of the importance of antioxidants in the biochemistry of living organisms. The possible mechanisms of action of antioxidants were first explored when it was recognized that a substance with anti-oxidative activity is likely to be one that is itself readily oxidized. Research into how vitamin E prevents the process of <b>lipid</b> <b>peroxidation</b> led to the identification of antioxidants as reducing agents that prevent oxidative reactions, often by scavenging reactive oxygen species before they can damage cells.|$|E

40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is {{a systemic}} autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation of multiple joints. The central pathogenesis of RA is {{the proliferation of}} synovial fibroblasts in response to inflammatory cytokines. However, some of the targeted therapies for inflammation reactions do not display significant clinical improvement after initiation of therapy. Thus, the relationship between inflammatory responses and RA therapy is still incompletely understood. In the present study, we proposed to determine whether enhanced inflammations may lead to cell apoptosis in rheumatoid arthritis synoviocytes. Our results indicated that products of <b>lipid</b> <b>peroxidations,</b> 4 -HNE, may induce synovial intrinsic inflammations by activating NF-κB pathways and it may lead to cell apoptosis. Pharmacological inhibition of NF-κB activation may reduce the 4 -HNE mediated inflammation responses and subsequent cell apoptosis. Our results may help to clarify the role of inflammations on RA development and imply that blocking NF-κB activation may be partly beneficial for human RA therapy. These findings might provide a mechanism-based rationale for developing new strategy to RA clinical therapy...|$|R

Moreover, blockade of an enzyme that produces endogenous SO2 significantly increased the amount of lung tissue damage in the experiment. Conversely, adding acetylcysteine or glutathione to the rat diet increased the amount of endogenous SO2 produced and decreased the lung damage, the free radical formation, oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis.|$|E
40|$|The endo{{cannabinoid}} system, through cannabinoid (CB) receptors, {{is involved}} in memory-related responses, {{as well as in}} processes that may affect cognition, like oxidative stress processes. The purpose of the experiments was to investigate the impact of CB 1 and CB 2 receptor ligands on the long-term memory stages in male Swiss mice, using the passive avoidance (PA) test, as well as the influence of these compounds on the level of oxidative stress biomarkers in the mice brain. A single injection of a selective CB 1 receptor antagonist, AM 251, improved long-term memory acquisition and consolidation in the PA test in mice, while a mixed CB 1 /CB 2 receptor agonist WIN 55, 212 - 2 impaired both stages of cognition. Additionally, JWH 133, a selective CB 2 receptor agonist, and AM 630, a competitive CB 2 receptor antagonist, significantly improved memory. Additionally, an acute administration of the highest used doses of JWH 133, WIN 55, 212 - 2, and AM 630, but not AM 251, increased total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in the brain. In turn, the processes of <b>lipids</b> <b>peroxidation,</b> expressed as the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA), were more advanced in case of AM 251.
