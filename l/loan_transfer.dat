5|$|The New Year {{started with}} a number of changes off the field. Loan signing Ndumbu-Nsungu {{returned}} to Gillingham but Heckingbottom's deal was extended to allow him to play against Accrington Stanley on New Year's Day, before a permanent deal was finalised the following week. Midfielder Lee Bullock was also signed on a <b>loan</b> <b>transfer</b> from Hartlepool United. City beat Accrington 2–0 with Matthew Clarke scoring his first for the club and Joe Colbeck adding his first since he returned from his loan spell at Darlington. It was followed up with another win, when Thorne scored City's first hat-trick for two years, to defeat Notts County 3–0. Two away draws followed at Bury and Wrexham, but City returned to winning ways with a 4–2 victory over Shrewsbury Town to finish the month unbeaten.|$|E
5|$|Crewe manager Dario Gradi {{decided not}} to offer a {{contract}} to Symes, who instead spent a period on trial at Bradford City, which included an 8–1 pre-season friendly win over Farsley Celtic. He signed for the League One side in July 2004 with fellow former Everton trainee Steven Schumacher, with whom he lived during his spell at Bradford. Symes made his Bradford debut in a 2–1 defeat at Hartlepool United on {{the opening day of}} the 2004–05 season. Three days later he missed a late penalty which would have secured Bradford victory over Peterborough United in a game in which Symes was also booked. Symes was dropped from the first team after Bradford signed Dele Adebola. When Bradford were allowed special dispensation to sign Neil Roberts, Bradford tried to give Symes a <b>loan</b> <b>transfer</b> to Darlington but the deal was blocked by the Football League. The following month, Symes scored his first goals for Bradford when he came off the bench at half-time to score twice in a 3–1 victory over Sheffield Wednesday on 23 October 2004. They were the only goals he scored that season from just 15 games.|$|E
5|$|The club {{were again}} in {{financial}} difficulties, and in June 1983, Martin {{called in the}} receivers and the club was put up for sale. A Save Bradford City Fund was launched on 24 July, and former chairman Stafford Heginbotham and former board member Jack Tordoff bought the club, forming a new company, and enabling the team to start the new league campaign. Centre forward Bobby Campbell was sold to Derby County to balance the books and John Hawley brought in as his replacement. City struggled on the pitch and won just one of their first 15games leaving them in the relegation zone. Campbell had played just 11games during four months with Derby and so he returned to Bradford initially on a <b>loan</b> <b>transfer.</b> His return coincided with a club record ten successive league victories. Campbell finished the season with nine goals, Hawley with 22, but City finished seventh and missed out on promotion.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I {{investigate}} whether banks use loan sales and securitizations (<b>loan</b> <b>transfers)</b> to manage regulatory capital and earnings. My analysis suggests that banks use gains from <b>loan</b> <b>transfers</b> to influence both reported earnings and regulatory capital {{after controlling for}} other economic motivations. The gains can be attributed both to cherry-picking of loans whose market values exceed their book values and also to overvaluation of the retained interests that are carried at fair market value {{in the case of}} securitizations. In addition, the use of securitizations for financial statement management is positively associated with the degree of financial reporting discretion available to managers. Finally, regulatory capital considerations seem to {{play a significant role in}} the decision to <b>transfer</b> <b>loans,</b> while earnings management considerations are more important in the calculation of reported gains conditional on performing a transfer, particularly in the case of securitizations...|$|R
