The conclusions suggest that the unit price of natural <b>gas</b> (<b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas)</b> is a factor impacting the quantity of natural <b>gas</b> (<b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas)</b> demanded by farmers, but {{there is no indication that}} other types of energy are substitutes for natural <b>gas</b> or <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas.</b> Additionally, the number of acres irrigated is an important factor driving the demand for natural <b>gas</b> and <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas.</b> Finally, the estimated models of natural <b>gas</b> and <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> demand were structurally stable over the period 1971 - 1989. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} improve the power {{performance}} of <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> engine, and the combustion parameters of <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> engine are studied, and the relations among chemical energy, mechanical energy, and thermal energy during <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> engine's combustion process are analyzed, a quasi-dimensional two-zone combustion model of <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> engine is established. Utilizing both computer simulation analysis of the combustion model and experiment analysis of the <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> engine, the study obtains the relation curve of cylinder pressure and temperature of burned mixture gas and crank angle.

40|$|Household {{surveys in}} Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka were {{analyzed}} using a two-stage Heckman model to examine the factors influencing {{the decision to use}} <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> (stage 1) and, among users, the quantity consumed per person (stage 2). In the first stage, <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> selection in all six countries increased with household expenditure and the highest level of education attained by female and male household members. Electricity connection increased, and engagement in agriculture and increasing household size decreased, <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> selection in five countries; urban residence increased selection in four countries; and rising firewood and kerosene prices increased selection in three countries each. In the second stage, the quantity of <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> consumed increased with rising household expenditure and decreasing price of <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> in every country. Urban residence increased and engagement in agriculture decreased <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> consumption. Surveys in Albania, Brazil, Mexico, and Peru, which did not report quantities, were also examined by calculating quantities using national average prices. Although fuel prices faced by individual households could not be tested, the findings largely supported those from the first six countries. Once the education levels of men and women were separately accounted for, the gender of the head of household was not statistically significant in most cases across the ten countries. Where it was significant (five equations), the sign of the coefficient was positive for men, possibly suggesting that female-headed households are burdened with unmeasured economic disadvantages, making less cash available for purchasing <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas.</b> Energy Production and Transportation,Markets and Market Access,Energy Conservation&Efficiency,Renewable Energy,Energy and Environment...|$|R
