5000|$|Tire Uniformity Machines are {{special-purpose}} {{machines that}} automatically inspect tires for the tire uniformity parameters described above. They consist of several subsystems, including tire handling, chucking, measurement rims, bead lubrication, inflation, <b>load</b> <b>wheel,</b> spindle drive, force measurement, and geometry measurement.|$|E
50|$|The tire {{is first}} centered, and the bead areas are {{lubricated}} to assure a smooth fitment to the measurement rims. The tire is indexed into the test station {{and placed on}} the lower chuck. The upper chuck lowers {{to make contact with}} the upper bead. The tire is inflated to the set point pressure. The <b>load</b> <b>wheel</b> advances to contact the tire and apply the set loading force. The spindle drive accelerates the tire to the test speed. Once speed, force, and pressure are stable, load cells measure the force exerted on the <b>load</b> <b>wheel</b> by the tire. The force signal is processed in analog circuitry, and then analyzed to extract the measurement parameters. Tires are marked according to various standards that may include RFV high point angle, side of positive conicity, and conicity magnitude.|$|E
50|$|There are {{numerous}} variations and innovations among several tire uniformity machine makers. The standard test speed for tire uniformity machines is 60 rpm {{of a standard}} <b>load</b> <b>wheel</b> that approximates 5 miles per hour. High speed uniformity machines are used {{in research and development}} environments that reach 250 km/h and higher. High speed uniformity machines have also been introduced for production testing. Machines that combine force variation measurement with dynamic balance measurement are also in use.|$|E

The weight of the car is transmitted to the rails and the underlying track structure through these <b>wheel</b> <b>loads.</b> As <b>wheel</b> <b>loads</b> increase, track maintenance expenses increase and the ability of a given rail weight, ballast depth, and tie configuration to handle prolonged rail traffic decreases.

40|$|Electrical drives lie at {{the heart}} of most {{industrial}} processes and make a major contribution to the comfort and high quality products we all take for granted. Electrical drives involving different types of electrical motors turn the wheels of industry. In an industrialized country, more than 60 % of the generated electrical energy is used in motor drives. The application of electrical drives spread from low fractional horse power applications in instruments to the industrial applications. Wide power, torque and speed ranges, adaptability to almost every operating condition, high efficiency, fast response, control simplicity, ability to operate as a generator in braking mode and various mechanical design types make the electrical drive very competitive among the other drive types. This work is based on the Robust Control Adjustable Electrical DC Drive System using PI (Proportional Integrator) controller. It encompasses the development of the DC drive. It also includes the design and fabrication of the mechanical <b>load</b> <b>wheel</b> structure. Thus the work finally gave a product in the form of a test jig for checking the wear and tear of a small metallic material after being spring pressed and scrubbed on the edged copper face of the aluminum disk wheel.

40|$|A non-contact, {{non-destructive}} {{method is}} described {{that allows the}} user to measure pavement texture and loaded and unloaded profiles from a moving vehicle. ^ The device uses laser distance measuring gages. The gages are arranged such that their readings can be interpreted to give the loaded and unloaded pavement profiles and a measure of its texture. Four gages are mounted on a rigid beam that, in turn, is mounted {{on the side of}} a load vehicle. The gages read the distance to the pavement. Three of the gages are located outside the range of influence of the <b>load</b> <b>wheel,</b> and hence the pavement below these gages is undeflected. One of the gages is adjacent to the <b>load</b> <b>wheel</b> to measure the induced deflection. An algorithm is presented that relates all measurements to a common datum. ^ The three gages yield readings that are interpreted to give the profile (do the surveying). The gages make so many readings and so quickly, that the standard deviation of the readings, taken over a short time period, gives a measure of the texture. ^ A prototype device was constructed and tested. The results were: (1) Pavement profiles were calculated using the new system. These compare favorably, though not completely, with the transit surveys. (2) Standard deviations were recorded. These readings were taken over concrete, asphalt and porous friction surface pavements. Differences were noted between the textures of concrete (smooth) and asphalt (rough) pavements. No correlation between this measure and standard measures was made. (3) The deflections caused by prototype loads were measured and recorded. This was done from the load vehicle, while the vehicle was moving across a pavement at the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers Waterways Experiment Station, in Vicksburg, Mississippi. The scheme for obtaining the resulting deflections is descibed in detail. An algorithm for accomodating the misalignment of the laser gages on the rigid beam is also presented. ^ Suggestions are offered for improving the system. ...|$|E
40|$|High impact forces {{arising from}} wheel impacts can damage train and track components. Early {{detection}} of wheel defects which causes these high impact forces {{is needed to}} prevent catastrophic failure of these components. The accelerometer based methods for determining the wheel impact load resulting from wheel defect is commonly used in Australia. This method relies on the dynamic response of the track in determining {{the magnitude of the}} impact load imposed on the track by a defective wheel. This study compares the rail acceleration due to dynamic impact forces caused by wheelflat for different axle <b>load,</b> <b>wheel</b> mass and train velocity. It is found that similar rail acceleration can be brought about with dynamic contact force that differs significantly for different axle load. It is also found that for high axle load the rail acceleration spectrum is concentrated in the lowe r frequency region...|$|E

Furthermore, to verify the precision of the numerical calculating results, some experiments were carried out by means of a JD- 1 wheel/rail simulation facility. The results show that there is same changing trend and almost same adhesion coefficient between the curves of numerical {{and experimental}} results. The relative difference between the numerical and experimental results is less than 10 %.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new machine {{that has been}} developed for directly measuring the deflection of airfield pavements under a rolling <b>load</b> <b>wheel.</b> This rolling weight deflectometer (RWD) optically measures the maximum amplitude of the depression basin using {{a new type of}} laser sensor that operates on the principle of triangulation. Four sensors that are mounted on a beam make pavement measurements. The key to producing accurate results is the requirement that the sensors remain in a straight line. Previous attempts using the method were plagued with deflection errors caused by thermal and vibrational beam bending. The patented RWD uses a laser to monitor bending of the physical beam in realtime. The information is used with pavement sensor data to produce accurate deflection measurements in the presence of significant beam bending. The bending-compensated RWD produces a deflection measurement with an accuracy of 40 μm (0. 0015 inch). The RWD consists of a horizontally transported beam, strategically placed pavement sensors, a subsystem that monitors beam bending, an odometer, and a data acquisition computer...|$|E
40|$|A novel smart tire {{monitoring}} system {{was designed and}} implemented on a fully functional car tire. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) based piezo-electric sensors were embedded inside rubber tire to measure strain related data. System electronics were implemented inside a robust IP- 68 (Ingress Protection) rated enclosure. This enclosure was mounted on a car wheel and successfully recorded sensory data onto an SD card during driving. Data collected from the PVDF sensors were then post-processed in Matlab. An artificial neural network (ANN) was built to correlate the sensor data to the readings given by an industry grade <b>load</b> <b>wheel.</b> Although the correlations are very crude, this study shows a promising way to analyze the strain related information from car tires by using PVDF sensors in conjunction with ANNs. This strain related information can then be used to estimate six different values concerning the tire, namely lateral force (Fy), longitudinal force (Fx), normal force (Fz), aligning moment (Mz), inflation pressure and friction coefficient. All of which are very important parameters for vehicle dynamics. However the estimation of these values is not presented {{within the context of}} this work. Two low cost data acquisition systems were designed in-house with two different Arduino platforms. However these fell short of data acquisition performance requirements required for realistic driving applications. It was seen that the Arduino family, low-end microprocessors, were not the best choice for applications of this nature. Finally electronic improvements such as the usage of field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) is discussed and suggested for future works...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} part of {{an extended}} laboratory study on the potential to apply the acoustic emission (AE) technique for in-situ rail-wheel interaction monitoring using rail-mounted sensors. The essential monitoring principle is that {{the intensity of the}} rail?wheel contact will affect the intensity of the AE that is generated during rolling. The current paper is confined to situations of 'normal' rolling, investigating the effects of wheel load, speed and lateral rattling of the generated AE, although the wider study includes the effects of rail and wheel irregularities on the AE generated. Rail-wheel contact was simulated on a scaled test rig consisting of a single wheel rolled round a circular track using a motor mounted at the centre of the track attached to a driving arm. AE was recorded at a fixed point on the track while the wheel was rolled around the track at a range of speeds with varying axle <b>load.</b> <b>Wheel</b> slip was found to be insignificant and tests using a simulated source confirmed that the energy recorded with a source at a given position on the track was repeatable. In one set of experiments, measures were taken to eliminate lateral rattling of the wheel and eccentricity of the wheel arc relative to the track arc. In a second set of experiments, some lateral float of the wheel along the axle was allowed and a limited amount of eccentricity was built into the track. The energy per wheel rotation for normal rolling was found to increase in a linear fashion with increasing axle load and centrifugal force, as would be expected due to the increasing rolling resistance with axle load and increasing lateral force with angular speed. The frictional instability associated with the lateral rattling was clearly detectible at low axle loads and lower speeds, and both natural and eccentricity (flange rubbing) rail abnormalities were detectible in the AE record. It is concluded that, with appropriate calibration, contact stresses between wheel and rail on straight or curved track can be monitored using track-mounted sensors so that cumulative contact stress can potentially be monitored...|$|E
