25|$|Historically, the Druze in Lebanon {{managed to}} {{maintain}} for centuries a small, hardy {{community in the}} Chouf Mountains overlooking Beirut surrounded by a sea of potential enemies, both Christian and Muslim, {{and they have a}} reputation of being savage fighters known for their tenacious battle spirit. Their esprit de corps and brutal methods often convinced their opponents to flee, whilst those who decided to stay and fight never <b>lived</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the tale. However, the Lebanese Druze have also been amiable to whoever controls the Chouf region at any given time, and they were pragmatic with their dealings with foreign powers such as the Israelis, Americans and Syrians.|$|E

According to Irish sources, Sigtrygg did not take part in the battle, but held his {{garrison}} in reserve in Dublin. [...] The Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh records that Sigtrygg was able to observe the progress of the battle and the movement of the battle standards from the ramparts of his fortress.

He was never pictured wearing his uniforms, after the fact, for the Republic of Hawai‘i as its official diplomat. Even so, the territorial government regularly drew on his memories to close the gap between the Hawaiian Kingdom and the territory and in order to legitimize its own existence in the process. It needed to insert its inevitability into the historical narrative, and used my great-great-grandfather’s public memories to represent its [...] "evidence of inheritance." ...|$|E

2500|$|Most of {{the world}} stood on the sidelines during the Rwandan genocide, hoping to avoid {{the loss of life}} and {{political}} entanglement that the American debacle in Somalia had created. As reports of the genocide spread through the media, the Security Council supplied more than five thousand troops to give a strong force. But the delay and denial of recommendations prevented the force from getting there on time and arrived months after the genocide was over. [...] In the events that took place after the genocide, many government officials in the community mourned over the loss of many and were surprised about the world’s obliviousness to the situation that could have prevented the massacre from taking place. The Rwandan genocide did not interest the outside world as the Yugoslavia genocide did. The outbreaks in Rwanda were seen as not of sufficient interest and value to warrant prevention of the violence, expense of resources or the risk of losing more casualties. The delay caused thousands of Rwandan lives to be lost and mentally scarred those who <b>lived</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the story.|$|E
2500|$|In 1959, Jones had {{his first}} {{number one on the}} Billboard country chart with [...] "White Lightnin'", {{ironically}} a more authentic rock and roll sound than his half-hearted rockabilly cuts. In the Same Ole Me retrospective, Johnny Cash insisted, [...] "George Jones woulda been a really hot rockabilly artist if he'd approached it from that angle. [...] Well, he was, really, but never got the credit for it." [...] "White Lightnin'" [...] was written by J. P. Richardson, better known as the Big Bopper. In I <b>Lived</b> <b>To</b> <b>Tell</b> It All, Jones confessed that he showed up for the recording session under the influence of a great deal of alcohol and it took him approximately 80 takes just to record his vocals. To make matters worse, Buddy Killen, who played the upright bass on the recording, was reported as having severely blistered fingers from having to play his bass part 80 times. Killen not only threatened to quit the session, but also threatened to physically harm Jones for the painful consequences of Jones' drinking. [...] On the final vocal take used on the recording Jones slurs the word [...] "slug", something he would mimic in live performances of the song along with using his southern drawl.|$|E

2500|$|George Glenn Jones {{was born}} on September 12, 1931 in Saratoga, Texas, and was raised in Colmesneil, Texas, with his brother and five sisters. His father, George Washington Jones, worked in a {{shipyard}} and played harmonica and guitar while his mother, Clara, played piano in the Pentecostal Church on Sundays. During his delivery, {{one of the doctors}} dropped Jones and broke his arm. When he was seven, his parents bought a radio and he heard country music for the first time. [...] Jones recalled to Billboard in 2006 that he would lie in bed with his parents on Saturday nights listening to the Grand Ole Opry and insist that his mother wake him if he fell asleep so he could hear Roy Acuff or Bill Monroe. [...] In his autobiography I <b>Lived</b> <b>To</b> <b>Tell</b> It All, Jones explains that the early death of his sister Ethel spurred on his father's drinking problem and, by all accounts, George Washington Jones could be physically and emotionally abusive to his wife and children when he drank. [...] In the book George Jones: The Life and Times of a Honky Tonk Legend, Bob Allen recounts how George Washington Jones would return home {{in the middle of the}} night with his cronies roaring drunk, wake up a terrified George Glenn Jones and demand that he sing for them or face a beating. [...] In a CMT episode of Inside Fame dedicated to Jones' life, country music historian Robert K. Oermann marveled, [...] "You would think that it would make him not a singer, because it was so abusively thrust on him. [...] But the opposite happened; he became a chronic singer. [...] He became someone who had to sing." [...] In the same program, Jones admitted that he remained ambivalent and resentful towards his father up until the day he died and observed in his autobiography [...] "The Jones family makeup doesn't sit well with liquor...Daddy was an unusual drinker. [...] He drank to excess but never while working, and he probably was the hardest working man I've ever known." [...] His father bought him his first guitar at age nine and he learned his first chords and songs at church and there are several photographs of a young George busking on the streets of Beaumont.|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, Jones {{released}} his last proper studio album on Epic, You Oughta Be Here With Me. [...] Although the album featured several stirring performances, including the lead single [...] "Hell Stays Open All Night Long" [...] and the Roger Miller-penned title song, the single did poorly and Jones made {{the switch to}} MCA, ending his relationship with Sherrill and what was now Sony Music after 19 years. [...] His first album with MCA, And Along Came Jones, was released in 1991 and, backed by MCA's powerful promotion team and producer Kyle Lehning (who had produced a string of hit albums for Randy Travis), the album sold better than his previous one had. [...] However, two singles, [...] "You Couldn't Get The Picture" [...] and [...] "She Loved A Lot In Her Time" [...] (a tribute to Jones' mother Clara), did not crack the top 30 on the charts as Jones lost favor with country radio as the format was altered radically during the early 1990s. [...] His last album to have significant radio airplay was 1992's Walls Can Fall, which featured the novelty song [...] "Finally Friday" [...] and [...] "I Don't Need Your Rockin' Chair," [...] a testament to his continued vivaciousness in old age. [...] Despite the lack of radio airplay, Jones continued to record and tour throughout the 1990s and {{was inducted into the}} Country Music Hall of Fame by Randy Travis in 1992. [...] In 1996, Jones {{released his}} autobiography I <b>Lived</b> <b>To</b> <b>Tell</b> It All with Tom Carter and the irony of his long career was not lost on him, with the singer writing in its preface, [...] "I also {{know that a lot of}} my show-business peers are going to be angry after reading this book. [...] So many have worked so hard to maintain their careers. [...] I never took my career seriously, and yet it's flourishing." [...] He also pulled no punches about his disappointment in the direction country music had taken, devoting a full chapter to the changes in the country music scene of the 1990s that saw him removed from radio playlists in favor of a younger generation of pop-influenced country stars. (Jones had long been a critic of country pop, and along with Wynette and Jean Shepard, he was one of the major backers of the Association of Country Entertainers, a guild promoting traditional country sounds that was founded in 1974; Jones's divorce from Wynette was a factor in the Association's collapse.) Despite his absence from the country charts during this time, latter-day country superstars such as Garth Brooks, Randy Travis, Alan Jackson, and many others often paid tribute to Jones while expressing their love and respect for his legacy as a true country legend who paved the way for their own success. [...] On February 17, 1998, The Nashville Network premiered a group of television specials called The George Jones Show, with Jones as host. [...] The program featured informal chats with Jones holding court with country's biggest stars old and new and, of course, music. [...] Guests included Loretta Lynn, Trace Adkins, Johnny Paycheck, Lorrie Morgan, Merle Haggard, Billy Ray Cyrus, Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, Charley Pride, Bobby Bare, Patty Loveless and Waylon Jennings, among others.|$|E
