25|$|Rader {{found that}} the <b>Live</b> <b>Traffic</b> paper was in a {{situation}} much more similar to the uncatalogued thesis in In re Bayer than the publicly disseminated posters in In re Klopfenstein. Rader concluded that the pre-publication <b>Live</b> <b>Traffic</b> paper could not be considered catalogued or indexed {{in a meaningful way}} and was not intended to be disseminated to the public. Rader concluded that, without additional information about the structure of SRI's FTP server, genuine issues of fact should have prevented the Delaware District Court from rendering summary judgment on the patent invalidity issues. The Federal Circuit thus vacated and remanded the Delaware District Court's determination of invalidity based on the <b>Live</b> <b>Traffic</b> paper.|$|E

25|$|A three member {{panel of}} the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a {{decision}} on January 8, 2008. Writing for the majority, Chief Judge Randall R. Rader upheld the District Court's decision that the '212' patent was enabled by the EMERALD paper and therefore invalid. However, he concluded that there were issues of material fact about whether the <b>Live</b> <b>Traffic</b> paper constituted prior art. Since a grant of summary judgment requires that there be no remaining issues of material fact between the parties, the majority vacated and remanded the District Court's grant of summary judgment that the <b>Live</b> <b>Traffic</b> paper invalidated the '203', '212', '338', and '615' patents.|$|E
25|$|The {{prior art}} {{qualification}} for the <b>Live</b> <b>Traffic</b> paper {{centered on the}} public accessibility of a document available on a FTP server. SRI argued that the FTP site was not publicly accessible because one would need the complete FTP address to view the paper. Additionally, the posting was not indexed and could only be found by an ordinary skilled user through “dumb luck”. Symantec and SSI countered that on multiple occasions SRI had provided links to the FTP site to multiple members of the intrusion detection community. Furthermore, SRI’s FTP site had been referenced by Google Groups and was widely regarded as a repository of information for computer security. Robinson’s examination of the case evidence noted that no {{attempts were made to}} limit access via password security. Robinson deemed the <b>Live</b> <b>Traffic</b> paper publicly accessible as established by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in the precedent cases In re Bayer, In re Hall, In re Cronyn, and In re Klopfenstein. As such, Robinson ruled that the <b>Live</b> <b>Traffic</b> paper constituted as prior art and that the patents described in the publication were invalid.|$|E

500|$|MY11: {{revisions}} to the styling identify this update, marketed by Holden as the [...] "Series II". Announced on 31 August 2010, and launched on 10 September, MY11 heralded styling changes across the range by way of new front fascias, the addition of aerodynamic lip detailing to the decklids of sedans, and new alloy wheel designs on the Berlina specification and higher. Front-end changes comprise partially reshaped headlamps, redesigned bumpers, and an enlarged grille with restyled inserts that differ throughout the model range. Inside, the interiors receive a redesigned centre console stack incorporating a new 6.5-inch touchscreen, new dashboard, rearranged controls, reconfigured ventilation outlets, and updates to trimmings and illumination colours. SV6, SS and SS V interiors are differentiated via the application of circular air vents. Standard on all models is the 6.5-inch infotainment system developed primarily by Siemens VDO. Dubbed [...] "Holden-iQ", this integrates media playback and control functions. The iQ head unit replaces the previous mechanical CD stacker with a single slot and built in storage for approximately 15 CDs worth of music (internal storage optional on the Omega). The system also features full iPod integration, USB and auxiliary input, and incorporates Bluetooth handsfree telephone compatibility and music streaming. On V-Series specifications, iQ incorporates satellite navigation with <b>live</b> <b>traffic</b> updates, speed zone alerts and traffic camera notification. Sedans and wagons specified with navigation also receive a reversing camera.In terms of powertrain, the MY11 brought flex-fuel capability for the 3.0-litre V6 and 6.0-litre V8, allowing them to run on E85 bio-ethanol (see above). With the MY11 update, Holden also introduced a new [...] "Redline" [...] sports package as an option on V-Series models. The package includes lightweight, forged and polished 19-inch multi-spoke alloy wheels from the Pontiac G8 GXP. Other Redline additions encompass four-piston Brembo high-performance brakes, stiffer [...] "FE3" [...] suspension and chromed window surrounds for sedans, and the fitment of the tyre inflater kit on the Redline Ute.|$|E
2500|$|Moore {{analyzed}} the case {{under the same}} precedents as those cited by the majority. She concluded that whereas the thesis in In re Bayer had not been catalogued, the structure of SRI's FTP server made the <b>Live</b> <b>Traffic</b> paper publicly accessible. According to Moore, the defendants had presented evidence that, given the host address for SRI's FTP server, one only needed to enter two directories to obtain the <b>Live</b> <b>Traffic</b> paper. The paper was stored under a directory titled [...] "EMERALD", which she argued {{would have been an}} obvious searching place for anyone looking for information on the project. Moreover, the <b>Live</b> <b>Traffic</b> paper was stored under the name [...] "ndss98.ps", the acronym for 1998 Network and Distributed System Security Symposium, a well-known conference. This evidence, according to Moore, was sufficient for a determination that the <b>Live</b> <b>Traffic</b> paper was not at all similar to the thesis in In re Bayer. Thus, Moore held that the [...] "library/thesis" [...] cases could not be applied to deny the defendants their motion for summary judgment of patent invalidity.|$|E

2500|$|As a [...] "dissemination" [...] precedent, Rader {{cited the}} Federal Circuit case In re Klopfenstein, which held that {{information}} presented on posters at professional conferences qualified as prior art, {{as the sole}} intent of such a poster is to publicly communicate research results. Rader recognized that, similar to the posters at a conference, the <b>Live</b> <b>Traffic</b> paper was posted in an open forum and might have been available to anyone with knowledge of FTP {{and the structure of}} SRI's FTP server. Unlike the posters at a conference, however, existence of the <b>Live</b> <b>Traffic</b> paper was not publicized or put in a location in which it could be viewed by interested people. According to Rader, SRI's posting of the <b>Live</b> <b>Traffic</b> paper on its FTP server was most similar to [...] "placing posters at an unpublicized conference with no attendees".|$|E
2500|$|Moore also {{analyzed}} the case under the precedents {{set by the}} [...] "dissemination" [...] cases. In discussing the pertinence of In re Klopfenstein, Moore analyzed each of that case's four requirements for patent invalidity due to public disseminations. According to Moore, the <b>Live</b> <b>Traffic</b> paper was available on the FTP server 24 hours per day for seven days, longer than the three days during which the posters from In re Klopfenstein were displayed. Thus, the <b>Live</b> <b>Traffic</b> paper met the first requirement of being available for longer than a transient period. Moreover, SRI had admitted during oral arguments that the target audience of the paper was members of the Internet security community. The defendants showed that this community included people {{who knew how to}} use SRI's FTP server and actually used it to share information. Thus, the FTP server met the second requirement of being accessible to experts in the field. Furthermore, neither Porras nor SRI took any steps to ensure that the paper would not be copied. Porras emailed links to the paper to many people outside of SRI and failed to take protective measures such as non-disclosure agreements or even disclaimers. Thus, the <b>Live</b> <b>Traffic</b> paper met the third requirement of failing to create a reasonable expectation that the work would not be copied. Finally, {{the very nature of the}} <b>Live</b> <b>Traffic</b> paper as an electronic document forced it to meet the fourth requirement that the document be easy to copy. Thus, Moore held that the [...] "dissemination" [...] cases clearly showed that the <b>Live</b> <b>Traffic</b> paper was publicly accessible.|$|E
2500|$|... Moore {{argued that}} the {{defendants}} had met the burden of showing that the <b>Live</b> <b>Traffic</b> paper was publicly accessible, both from the [...] "library/thesis" [...] standpoint and the [...] "dissemination" [...] standpoint, while SRI had failed to provide any contrary evidence which would prevent summary judgment.|$|E

2500|$|As [...] "library/thesis" [...] precedents, Rader {{cited the}} Federal Circuit case In re Bayer, which had {{held that a}} {{graduate}} school thesis {{that had not been}} cataloged or placed on library shelves, and that was only known to the three faculty members who served on the thesis committee, did not qualify as a printed publication. Rader also cited the Federal Circuit case In re Cronyn, in which a thesis was placed in a library and indexed by the author's last name, and was determined not to qualify as a printed publication. Rader acknowledged that SRI International had elements in common with In Re Bayer. His analysis likened the uncatalogued nature of the thesis in the library to the posting of the <b>Live</b> <b>Traffic</b> paper on an FTP server which did not allow for searching and did not contain an index. According to Rader, the fact that Porras emailed direct links to those accessing the papers showed that a person skilled in the field {{would not have been able}} to access the <b>Live</b> <b>Traffic</b> Paper. Moreover, Rader argued that the public accessibility was less compelling for SRI International than it was for In re Bayer, as the document in the former case was in pre-publication review, while the thesis in the latter had already been completed.|$|E
