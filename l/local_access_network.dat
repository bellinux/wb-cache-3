40|$|From {{the optical}} {{networking}} perspective, the future Internet {{may be viewed}} as a three-level hierarchy consisting of backbone networks, metropolitan area <b>networks,</b> and <b>local</b> <b>access</b> <b>networks,</b> as illustrated in Fig. 1. The backbone networks will provide abundant bandwidth by employing wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) links that are interconnected with reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers (OADMs) and optical cross connects [1]. The metropolitan area networks, or metro networks for short, interconnect the backbone <b>networks</b> with the <b>local</b> <b>access</b> <b>networks.</b> The <b>local</b> <b>access</b> <b>networks</b> carry the data from and to the individual users.

However, the traffic generated by the sensing and processing systems may overload <b>local</b> <b>access</b> <b>networks.</b> A coexistence problem arises where concurrent applications mutually interfere and compete for available resources. This effect is further aggravated by the multiple scales involved and heterogeneity of the networks supporting the urban IoT. One of the main contributions {{of this paper is}} the introduction of the notion of content-oriented cognitive interference control in heterogeneous <b>local</b> <b>access</b> <b>networks</b> supporting computing and data processing in the urban IoT. A network scenario where multiple communication technologies, such as Device-to-Device and Long Term Evolution (LTE), is considered.

The cognitive network paradigm is extended to dynamically shape the interference pattern generated by concurrent data streams and induce a packet loss trajectory compatible with video processing algorithms. Numerical results show that the proposed cognitive transmission strategy enables a significant throughput increase of interfering applications for a target accuracy of the monitoring application.

Residential voice service is still mostly provided via an analog signal over a pair of copper wires that connects the telephone to a switching system in a central office. The high-speed digital technology employed by modern switching systems and inter-office transmission systems does not extend to most residences. The <b>local</b> <b>access</b> <b>network</b> is a landscape of copper wires bound into large cables, splices, cross-boxes and other equipment that has provided voice-grade service over the years.
