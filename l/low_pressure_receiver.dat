40|$|Recent {{attempts}} to find energy-efficient thermal management systems for electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles have led to secondary loop systems as an alternative approach to meet dynamic heating and cooling demands and reduce refrigerant charge. As such, {{a thorough understanding of}} the vapor compression cycle, which serves as the central thermal supply unit, is required. In addition to design considerations concerning the type and size of components such as the heat exchangers or compressor, the refrigerant reservoir choice between a high <b>pressure</b> <b>receiver</b> or a <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> accumulator is critical for energy-efficient operation under varying operation conditions. In this work, two possible positions of the accumulator/receiver are experimentally examined and optimal control is applied. Therefore, either the superheating at the compressor inlet or outlet of the receiver system or the subcooling at the condenser outlet of the accumulator system are chosen as control variables and adjusted by an electrical expansion valve. Experimental results based on a simple automotive R 134 a primary loop system containing a scroll compressor are presented. Comparing these two different systems with a receiver or an accumulator, a receiver system shows a slightly higher COP under the examined operation conditions when operated optimally. However the receiver/accumulator position has a non-negligible impact on high and <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> itself resulting in an advantage for the accumulator system in a cold winter scenario...|$|R

Since {{there is not a}} need for superheat at the evaporator exit, each evaporator expansion valve can be controlled by a signal representative, either of the evaporator load, or the evaporator performance, such as the air temperature at its inlet or outlet. When compared to dry-expansion evaporator systems, the proposed solution offers energy saving and smooth operating conditions, typical of flooded evaporators, while still maintaining a simple plant lay-out. The concept was experimentally validated: the evaporators were maintained in flooded conditions, while the ejector was able to promote liquid recirculation.

40|$|A {{facility}} has been constructed {{to simulate the}} flow in a pulse detonation engine. This report describes the design, construction, initial test results, and analyses of the basic operation of the facility. The principle of operation {{is that of a}} blow down wind tunnel with a pressurized supply reservoir of air emptying through a test section into a <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>receiver</b> vessel. The flow is started abruptly by rupturing a diaphragm that separates the downstream end of the test section from the receiver vessel. Following a short transient period of a wave propagation, a quasi-steady flow is set up in the rectangular test section of 100 x 100 mm cross section. The quasi-steady operation lasts about 0. 15 s. During this time, a typical operating condition results in a test section Mach number of about 0. 7 and a velocity of 200 m/s. The pressure and temperature in the test section can be adjusted by varying the conditions in the supply reservoir. The current implementation uses room temperature air at pressures up to 6 bar in the supply reservoir. Tests were carried out to determine the performance {{as a function of the}} pressures in the supply and receiver vessel. Measurements included pressure and temperature in the two vessels and pitot and static probe measurements of the test section flow. Flow visualization with a schlieren system was also carried out. The data were analyzed by using simple one-dimensional steady and unsteady gas dynamics. Some two-dimensional unsteady numerical simulations were also carried out to examine the influence of the diaphragm location on the flow starting process. A control-volume model has been developed to predict the variation of pressure with time in the supply and receiver vessels. This model and analyses of the tests indicates that choked flow results in a constant Mach number inside the test section. The duration of the choked flow regime and the conditions within the test section can be reliably estimated with this model...|$|E
