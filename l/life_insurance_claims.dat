40|$|Abstract: Cluster Analysis is {{a useful}} {{technique}} for grouping data points such that points within a single group or cluster are similar, while points in different groups are distinctive. Clustering as an unsupervised learning algorithm is {{a good candidate for}} fraud and anomaly detection. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the possibility of using clustering technology for continuous auditing. Automating fraud filtering can be of great value to preventive continuous audits. In this paper, cluster-based outliers help auditors focus their efforts when evaluating group <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>claims.</b> Claims with similar characteristics have been grouped together and those clusters with small population have been flagged for further investigations. Some dominant characteristics of those clusters are, for example, having large beneficiary payment, having huge interest amount and having been submitted long time before getting paid.

40|$|In the actuarial literature, it {{has become}} common {{practice}} to model future capital returns and mortality rates stochastically in order to capture market risk and forecasting risk. Although interest rates often should and mortality rates {{always have to be}} non-negative, many authors use stochastic diffusion models with an affine drift term and additive noise. As a result, the diffusion process is Gaussian and, thus, analytically tractable, but negative values occur with positive probability. The argument is that the class of Gaussian diffusions would be a good approximation of the real future development. We challenge that reasoning and study the asymptotics of diffusion processes with affine drift and a general noise term with corresponding diffusion processes with an affine drift term and an affine noise term or additive noise. Our study helps to quantify the error that is made by approximating diffusive interest and mortality rate models with Gaussian diffusions and affine diffusions.

Cats with pyometra were diagnosed at a median age of 4  years and a significant breed effect was observed. The breed with the highest IR (433 cats per 10, 000 CYAR) was the Sphynx, and other breeds with IR over 60 cats per 10, 000 CYAR were Siberian cat, Ocicat, Korat, Siamese, Ragdoll, Maine coon, and Bengal.

40|$|THERE is a {{shortage}} of population-based information on the incidence of disease and death in horses. Information is often available, but there are few estimates of the size and compo-sition of the population at risk, and to make population-based estimates about morbidity and mortality it is necessary to relate case information to the population at risk. Among the few population-based studies that have been carried out, the demographic characteristics of the horse population of Michigan, USA, have been described by Kaneene and others (1997 a), and similar studies have been made of the horses in 28 states in the USA (NAHMS 1998), northern Britain (Mellor and others 1999) and Sweden (Anon 2000). The morbidity and mortality patterns of horse populations in the USA have also been described (Kaneene and others 1997 b, NAHMS 1998). Furthermore, the longevity and mortality of different horse breeds have been estimated in Britain by Comfort (1958), in France by Ricard and Fournet-Hanocq (1977) and in Sweden by Wallin and others (2000). Primary data sources for horses are scarce and of limited availability, and secondary sources, such as medical databases, breeding registries and insurance data, have therefore been used to provide population-related information on mortal-ity. Leblond and others (2000) used information from several insurance companies when investigating the mortality pat-tern of horses in France, and losses among insured horses in the USA have also been investigated (Greenhall 1979, Barkley 1983). Bergsten (1983) reported the reimbursed <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>claims</b> for diseases of the locomotor system in a population of insured horses in Sweden. The general mortality rates among German racehorses and competition horses have also been reported (von Lindner and Offeney 1992). In most cases, the statistics have focused on the individual cases rather than on the proportion of the underlying population that the dead horses represented. To improve knowledge about the causes of death of horses {{it is important to consider}} not only the overall death rate but also the diagnosis-specific and breed-specific results. Over 40 per cent of the Swedish horse population is insured by the Agria insurance company.

40|$|PhD, Operational Research, North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2011 The use of {{analytical}} {{techniques for}} fraud detection {{and the design}} of fraud detection systems have been topics of several research projects {{in the past and}} have seen varying degrees of success in their practical implementation. In particular, several authors regard the use of credit risk scorecards for fraud detection as a useful analytical detection tool. However, research on analytical fraud detection for the South African insurance industry is limited. Furthermore, real world restrictions like the availability and quality of data elements, highly unbalanced datasets, interpretability challenges with complex analytical techniques and the evolving nature of insurance fraud contribute to the on-going challenge of detecting fraud successfully. Insurance organisations face financial instability from a global recession, tighter regulatory requirements and consolidation of the industry, which implore the need for a practical and effective fraud strategy. Given the volumes of structured and unstructured data available in data warehouses of insurance organisations, it would be sensible for an effective fraud strategy to take into account data-driven methods and incorporate analytical techniques into an overall fraud risk assessment system. Having said that, the complexity of the analytical techniques, coupled with the effort required to prepare the data to support it, should be carefully considered as some studies found that less complex algorithms produce equal or better results. Furthermore, an over reliance on analytical models can underestimate the underlying risk, as observed with credit risk at financial institutions during the financial crisis. An attractive property {{of the structure of the}} probabilistic weights-of-evidence (WOE) formulation for risk scorecard construction is its ability to handle data issues like missing values, outliers and rare cases. It is also transparent and flexible in allowing the re-adjustment of the bins based on expert knowledge or other business considerations. The approach proposed in the study is to construct fraud risk scorecards at entity level that incorporate sets of intrinsic and relational risk factors to support a robust fraud risk assessment. The study investigates the application of an integrated Suspicious Activity Assessment System (SAAS) empirically using real-world South African insurance data. The first case study uses a data sample of short-term insurance claims data and the second a data sample of <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>claims</b> data. Both case studies show promising results. The contributions of the study are summarised as follows: The study identified several challenges with the use of an analytical approach to fraud detection within the context of the South African insurance industry. The study proposes the development of fraud risk scorecards based on WOE measures for diagnostic fraud detection, within the context of the South African insurance industry, and the consideration of alternative algorithms to determine split points. To improve the discriminatory performance of the fraud risk scorecards, the study evaluated the use of analytical techniques, such as text mining, to identify risk factors. In order to identify risk factors from large sets of data, the study suggests the careful consideration of both the types of information as well as the types of statistical techniques in a fraud detection system. The types of information refer to the categories of input data available for analysis, translated into risk factors, and the types of statistical techniques refer to the constraints and assumptions of the underlying statistical techniques. In addition, the study advocates the use of an entity-focused approach to fraud detection, given that fraudulent activity typically occurs at an entity or group of entities level. Doctora...|$|E

This paper correlates non-life insurance penetration in 70 countries with income level, financial sector depth, country risk, a measure of cost of insurance, and the World Bank governance indexes. We find that institutional quality-transparency-uncertainty nexus is the dominant determinant of insurability across countries, surpassing the explanatory power of income level. Institutional quality, as it reflects on the level of uncertainty, is the deeper determinant of insurability. Insurability is lower when governance is weaker.

People identified with increased risk {{might be able}} to prevent or delay the onset of illness by medical treatment and/or changing their environmental exposure. But tests might also help organizations, such as employers, insurers, and government bodies, to minimize their future economic risks. This article searches for an ethical and feasible European policy for the use of genetic information in <b>life</b> <b>insurance.</b> It first argues that genetic information is not so relevantly different from at least one other kind of medical information, that of HIV infection, that it justifies unlike policy treatment. European <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> is then <b>claimed</b> to be a non-primary social good which should be handled by the private market. The problem of adverse selection is argued to be a reasonably serious threat. Insurers should therefore be allowed to demand some genetic risk information in order to secure the sustainability of insurance schemes. However, the moral principles and values of autonomy, privacy, non-discrimination, non-deterrence, solidarity and confidentiality, put limits on insurers justified information demands. The article ends up advocating a regime of limited community-rated private <b>life</b> <b>insurance,</b> first proposed by a Dutch committee. It stipulates that insurers should be forbidden to demand genetic tests as a condition for an insurance contract, but be allowed to ask for existing genetic information when the sought insurance cover is above a certain limit. genetic information <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> European policy ethics genetic predisposition tests...|$|R
