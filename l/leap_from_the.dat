5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} crossings, steamers took the crowds from Circular Quay, although this time only four were needed, while another 600â€“700 people {{made their own}} way to the site. The ride was scheduled for 3 pm on 23 December, but delays meant L'Estrange did not appear until 6 pm. Although the length of rope was over 182 metres, it was only just over nine metres above the water. The stay wires were held in boats on either side, with the crews rowing against each other to keep it steady. L'Estrange rode his bicycle towards the centre, where, with the rope swinging to and fro, he stopped briefly to steady himself but instead, realising he was losing his balance, {{he was forced to}} <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rope and fell into the water below. Although he was unhurt, it was another knock to his reputation. A repeat attempt was announced for the following weekend. Again steamers took a dwindling crowd to Banbury Bay where they found L'Estrange's rope had been mysteriously cut, and he cancelled the performance. The Daily Telegraph reported that many in the crowd, who had paid for tickets on the steamers, felt they had been scammed.|$|E

As per the same source Iran ranked 20th and 17th by total output in 2010 and 2011 respectively.|$|E

25|$|As {{a senior}} in 2003, he rushed for 2,960 yards on 252 attempts, an average of 11.7 yards per carry, and 32 touchdowns. After a game, players from the other team asked for his autograph. Following Maurice Clarett's {{unsuccessful}} attempt to sue the NFL over its age limit in 2004, there was considerable debate over whether any high school football player {{might be able to}} make the <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> preps to the pro game. The player most frequently mentioned was Peterson.|$|E
25|$|On 1 March 1811, Muhammad Ali invited all of {{the leading}} Mamluks to his palace to {{celebrate}} the declaration of war against the Wahhabis in Arabia. Between 600 and 700 Mamluks paraded for this purpose in Cairo. Muhammad Ali's forces killed almost {{all of the}}se near the Al-Azab gates in a narrow road down from Mukatam Hill. This ambush {{came to be known}} as the Massacre of the Citadel. According to contemporary reports, only one Mamluk, whose name is given variously as Amim (also Amyn), or Heshjukur (a Besleney), survived when he forced his horse to <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> walls of the citadel.|$|E

25|$|Most {{efficient}} glider. This can {{be taken}} as the animal that moves most horizontal distance per metre fallen. Flying squirrels are known to glide up to , but have measured glide ratio of about 2. Flying fish have been observed to glide for hundreds of metres on the drafts {{on the edge of}} waves with only their initial <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> water to provide height, but may be obtaining additional lift from wave motion. On the other hand, albatrosses have measured lift/drag ratios of 20, and thus fall just 1 meter (foot) for every 20 in still air.|$|E
25|$|Further bomb alerts {{were issued}} {{across the region}} and two similar devices {{discovered}} on trains, at York Road railway station in Belfast and at Greenisland railway station. Both were removed safely and control detonated. The devices were simple incendiary bombs similar to that which exploded south of Befast, consisting of a 5lb block of explosives attached to a petrol can with a simple time device intended to delay the explosion until the train was empty that evening. Later testimony indicated that Delaney had armed {{the first of two}} bombs and placed it beside him as he picked up the second one. As he armed this device, the first bomb suddenly detonated for reasons that remain unknown. Delaney was killed instantly and his accomplice, Patrick Joseph Flynn, was forced to <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> train in flames. Flynn was guarded by police in hospital and arrested once his wounds had healed sufficiently.|$|E
25|$|Out of {{the twelve}} {{passengers}} who suffered major injuries, nine suffered the injuries from the impact and three suffered the injuries from the evacuation. Most of the injuries occurred to passengers and crew located in the flight deck and forward cabin. According to passenger reports, the <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> aircraft to the ground caused many of the injuries, including broken legs, and ruptured vertebrae. The Captain sustained back and head injuries during {{the impact of the}} crash when his seat was wrenched out of place by the force of the impact, causing him to hit his head against the overhead controls. Minor injuries included twisted ankles, sore necks, bruises and effects from smoke inhalation. A total of 33 persons were taken to various hospitals within and outside Toronto for treatment, of which 21 were treated for minor injuries and released. The York-Finch campus of the Humber River Regional Hospital treated seven people for smoke inhalation. William Osler Health Centre, Etobicoke General Hospital, Credit Valley Hospital, and Peel Memorial Hospital were additional nearby hospitals that had admitted victims of the crash.|$|E

500|$|Originally {{referred}} to as [...] "F-Zero on water", the game was intended to feature high-speed boats with transforming capabilities. However, these were ultimately replaced with Jet Skis as producer Shigeru Miyamoto felt that the game would not be differentiated enough from other titles on other systems. Wave Race 64 received critical acclaim from critics, who praised the game's satisfying controls and dynamic watery environments. The game is credited for helping Nintendo effectively make its paradigmatic <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 16-bit 2D graphics of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System to the Nintendo 64's 3D capabilities. It was re-released for the Wii and Wii U's Virtual Console in 2007 and 2016, respectively. A sequel, , was released in 2001.|$|E
500|$|The pre-title {{sequence}} {{lasts for}} about 14 minutes, the longest pre-title sequence in the Bond series to date. In the [...] "making of" [...] documentaries on the Ultimate Edition DVD release, director Michael Apted {{said that the}} scene was originally much longer than that. Originally, the pre-credits sequence was to have ended with Bond's <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> window and descent to the ground, finishing as Bond rushes away from the area as police cars approach. Then, after the credits the sequence in MI6 headquarters would have been next, with the boat scenes the next major action sequence. However, the pre-credits scenes were viewed as lacklustre when compared to ones from previous 007 films, so the credits were pushed back to appear after the boat sequence. The Daily Telegraph claimed that the British Government prevented some filming {{in front of the}} actual MI6 Headquarters at Vauxhall Cross, citing a security risk. However, a Foreign Office spokesperson rejected the claims and expressed displeasure with the article.|$|E
500|$|Wave Race 64 was {{developed}} by Nintendo EAD and produced by Shigeru Miyamoto {{as one of the}} very first Nintendo 64 games. Development of the game was led by Shinya Takahashi, who had been working with Nintendo since 1989. Takahashi, along with Yoshiaki Koizumi, who worked with Miyamoto on Super Mario 64, is credited for helping the company effectively make its paradigmatic <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 16-bit 2D graphics of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System to the Nintendo 64's 3D capabilities. Since the game's engineers only had experience with the 2D graphics of earlier Nintendo consoles, Takahashi had to guide them through the first stages of development. While experimenting with the Nintendo 64's Silicon Graphics technology, one of the programmers created a tech demo that served {{as an example of the}} game's wave programming. The tech demo caught the attention of Miyamoto, and soon the team began to figure out a way to create [...] "something fun" [...] from it.|$|E

500|$|Even If It Kills Me was {{released}} on September 18, 2007 and represented a large <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> group's last chart performance: it peaked at number 16 on the Billboard 200 and {{number one on the}} magazine's Independent Albums chart. [...] "This Is for Real" [...] became their best-charting single, peaking at number 48 in Australia. Cain later felt that the band placed far too much emphasis at the time on [...] "numbers and trajectory instead of the creative process." [...] The following year saw a rise in profile for the band: they worked out promotional deals with Coca-Cola and Pepsi, their music was licensed in various television shows, movies, and video games, and they toured heavily. The band released an acoustic EP featuring songs from Even if It Kills Me in May 2008. They later released a music video for the acoustic rendition of [...] "Fell in Love Without You". After the release of the EP, the band toured on the Honda Civic Tour with Panic at the Disco and Phantom Planet, and then joined the last weeks of the Warped Tour 2008. In September, they headlined on The Left Handed Forms of Human Endeavor Tour.|$|E
500|$|The {{zones in}} The Legendary Axe consist of {{different}} environments; {{they range from}} dark forests to caverns to mountain plateaus to fortresses. Players will face many enemies along the way which {{they need to get}} through: [...] "frog men" [...] that <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> water and spit fire; jumping and rolling amoeba creatures in the caverns; [...] "rock men" [...] that spring out and attack on the mountain plateaus; and giant spiders that shoot webs at players. The bosses in the game are guardians of Jagu's cult and are fought {{at the end of each}} zone. They include the following: at the end of Zone1, a pair of possessed grizzly bears; of Zone2, a magical boulder; of Zone3, a group of flying slinky-type monsters called [...] "Aqua Lungs"; and of Zone4, a pair of creatures with shields and spears called [...] "Punjabbis". Zone5 culminates with a maze of rooms called the [...] "Pits of Madness" [...] which feature every enemy encountered up to that point plus some new enemies; at its end is a fire-throwing cult demon. Zone6 consists of the final battle with Jagu himself.|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} B-stage, U2 often played [...] "Bad" [...] or [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday", with {{performances}} of [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky" [...] and [...] "Running to Stand Still" [...] following. For [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky", the video screens displayed burning crosses and swastikas. During [...] "Running to Stand Still", Bono mimed {{the actions of}} a heroin addict from the B-stage, rolling up his sleeves and then pretending to spike his arm during the final lyric. Afterwards, red and yellow smoke flares ignited from either end of the B-stage, before the band re-grouped on the main stage for U2 classics played straight. [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] was accompanied by sped-up video of the group in the desert from The Joshua Trees photo shoot. U2 often finished their set with [...] "Pride (In the Name of Love)" [...] while a clip from Martin Luther King, Jr.'s famed [...] "I've Been to the Mountaintop" [...] speech was played on the video screens. The group was initially unconvinced that the <b>leap</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rest of the show's irony and artifice to something more sincere would be successful, but they thought {{that it was important to}} demonstrate that certain ideals were so strong and true that they could be held onto no matter the circumstance. The group alternated performances of [...] "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" [...] in acoustic form on the B-stage with using it to close the main set.|$|E
