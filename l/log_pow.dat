So far, {{the main drawback of}} the SiFA {{technology for the}} synthesis of PET-radiotracers is the high lipophilicity of the resulting radiopharmaceutical. Consequently, we synthesized new SiFA-octreotate analogues derivatized with Fmoc-NH-PEG-COOH, Fmoc-Asn(Ac?AcNH-?-Glc) -OH, and SiFA-aldehyde (SIFA-A). The substances could be labeled in high yields (38 ± 4 %) and specific activities between 29 and 56 GBq/?mol in short synthesis times of less than 30 min (e. o. b.). The in vitro evaluation of the synthesized conjugates displayed a sst 2 receptor affinity (IC?? = 3. 3 ± 0. 3 nM) comparable to that of somatostatin- 28. As a measure of lipophilicity of the conjugates, the <b>log</b> <b>P(ow)</b> was determined and found to be 0. 96 for SiFA-Asn(AcNH-?-Glc) -PEG-Tyr³-octreotate and 1. 23 for SiFA-Asn(AcNH-?-Glc) -Tyr³-octreotate, which is considerably lower than for SiFA-Tyr³-octreotate (<b>log</b> <b>P(ow)</b> = 1. 59).

Seven protein spots showed significant differential expression in the solvent exposed cells. The tryptic digest of the differentially regulated proteins were identified by LC-ESI MS/MS. The identity of these proteins matched with porins OprD, OprE, OprF, OprH, Opr 86, LPS assembly protein and A-type flagellin. The reported pI values of these proteins were in the range of 4. 94 - 8. 67 and the molecular weights were in the range of 19. 5 - 104. 5 kDa. The results suggest significant down-regulation of the A-type flagellin, OprF and OprD and up-regulation of OprE, OprH, Opr 86 and LPS assembly protein in presence of organic solvents. OprF and OprD are implicated in antibiotic uptake and outer membrane stability, whereas A-type flagellin confers motility and chemotaxis. Up-regulated OprE is an anaerobically-induced porin while Opr 86 is responsible for transport of small molecules and assembly of the outer membrane proteins.

The ratio of the maximum (using LMCI for CLint) to minimum (using UMCI for CLint) AUC predicted by the QPPR-PBPK model was 1. 36 ± 0. 4 and ranged from 1. 06 (1, 1 -dichloroethylene) to 2. 8 (isoprene). Overall, the integrated QPPR-PBPK modeling method developed in this study is a pragmatic way of characterizing the impact of the lack of knowledge of CLint in predicting human pharmacokinetics of VOCs, as well as the impact of predictio...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Rotenone is a botanical {{pesticide}} {{derived from}} extracts of Derris roots, which is traditionally used as piscicide, {{but also as}} an industrial insecticide for home gardens. Its mechanism of action is potent inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation by blocking electron transport at complex-I. Despite its classification as mild to moderately toxic to humans (estimated LD 50, 300 - 500 mg/kg), there is a striking variety of acute toxicity of rotenone depending on the formulation (solvents). Human fatalities with rotenone-containing insecticides have been rarely reported, and a rapid deterioration {{within a few hours}} of the ingestion has been described previously in one case. Case report: A 49 -year-old Tamil man with a history of asthma, ingested 250 mL of an insecticide containing 1. 24 % of rotenone (3. 125 g, 52. 1 - 62. 5 mg/kg) in a suicide attempt at home. The product was not labeled as toxic. One hour later, he vomited repeatedly and emergency services were alerted. He was found unconscious with irregular respiration and was intubated. On arrival at the emergency department, he was comatose (GCS 3) with fixed and dilated pupils, and absent corneal reflexes. Physical examination revealed hemodynamic instability with hypotension (55 / 30 mmHg) and bradycardia (52 bpm). Significant laboratory findings were lactic acidosis (pH 6. 97, lactate 17 mmol/L) and hypokalemia (2 mmol/L). Cranial computed tomography (CT) showed early cerebral edema. A single dose of activated charcoal was given. Intravenous hydration, ephedrine, repeated boli of dobutamine, and a perfusor with 90 micrograms/h norepinephine stabilized blood pressure temporarily. Atropine had a minimal effect on heart rate (58 bpm). Intravenous lipid emulsion was considered (<b>log</b> <b>Pow</b> 4. 1), but there was a rapid deterioration with refractory hypotension and acute circulatory failure. The patient died 5 h after ingestion of the insecticide. No autopsy was performed. Quantitative analysis of serum performed by high-resolution/accurate mass-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography (LC-HR/AM-MS) : 560 ng/mL rotenone. Other substances were excluded by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Conclusion: The clinical course was characterized by early severe symptoms and a rapidly fatal evolution, compatible with inhibition of mitochondrial energy supply. Although rotenone is classified as mild to moderately toxic, physicians must be aware that suicidal ingestion of emulsified concentrates may be rapidly fatal. (n= 3) : stridor, cyanosis, cough (one each). Local swelling after chewing or swallowing soap developed at the earliest after 20 minutes and persisted beyond 24 hours in some cases. Treatment with antihistamines and/or steroids relieved the symptoms in 9 cases. Conclusion: Bar soap ingestion by seniors carries a risk of severe local reactions. Half the patients developed symptoms, predominantly swellings of tongue and/or lips (38 %). Cognitive impairment, particularly in the cases of dementia (37 %), may increase the risk of unintentional ingestion. Chewing and intraoral retention of soap leads to prolonged contact with the mucosal membranes. Age-associated physiological changes of oral mucosa probably promote the irritant effects of the surfactants. Medical treatment with antihistamines and corticosteroids usually leads to rapid decline of symptoms. Without treatment, there may be a risk of airway obstruction...|$|E
40|$|Alternative {{methods in}} {{ecotoxicology}} play {{an increasingly important}} role in chemical and risk assessment. Already in 1986, the Directive 86 / 609 /EEC stated that an alternative method, once it is “practicably and reasonably available”, should replace the corresponding animal method. In 2007, REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals) came into force to systematically evaluate the risk to {{human health and the}} environment of approx. 30, 000 chemical substances produced, used or imported in quantities of 1 - 100 t/a. Within the framework of REACH, animal testing should be reduced or even replaced by alternative methods. The 96 h acute fish test, however, is still a mandatory component in the base set of data required for chemical risk assessment. With mortality as the exclusive endpoint, it is not compatible with most current animal welfare legislations in Europe. Furthermore, there is increasing concern that some form of pain perception, similar to what is present in mammals, may be present in bony fish, and adult fish exposed to acute toxic concentrations of chemicals may at least be suspected to suffer severe distress and pain. A promising candidate to replace the acute fish test in chemical assessment is the fish embryo toxicity (FET) test. In Germany, the FET has already replaced the acute fish test in whole effluent testing since 2005. A major advantage of the FET concerning animal welfare is the fact that embryos may have not yet developed the same complex mental processes and may have not pain perception identical to adult fish. Since the correlation between the alternative and the test to be replaced is one of the most important facts to accept a test as alternative, a detailed literature research and a thorough re-evaluation of FET and acute fish test data has been conducted. The analyses resulted in an overall R 2 of 0. 90 for the comparison of FET data and acute fish test data. Restricting the data to zebrafish (Danio rerio) FET data and all fish data, the correlation resulted in an R 2 of 0. 87. In general, all correlations with different restrictions of the complete dataset (e. g. only zebrafish FET and zebrafish acute fish test data, only 48 h FET and 96 h fish toxicity data, etc.) showed no R 2 lower than 0. 81. For comparison between different biotests, these are almost perfect correlations, and compared to correlations of 96 h acute fish data among different fish species, they are in the same range or even better. However, outliers are inevitable. In order to investigate if the static procedure of the FET may be the reason for outliers, a flow-through protocol was developed. The applicability of the flow-through system in chemical assessment was checked by testing four different “outlier chemicals” (hydroquinone, 4 -chlorophenol, pyraclostrobin and α-endosulfan), which were selected according to increasing <b>log</b> <b>Pow.</b> Independent of chemical nature and lipophilicity, the flow-through and the static FET gave almost identical results for all substances. Thus, at least for these chemicals, the differences between the results from the FET and the acute fish toxicity test could not be traced back to reduced bioavailability due to adsorption to the polystyrene plates. Further investigations are necessary to identify reasons for the poor correlation between FET and acute fish test results for specific chemicals. However, the static protocol seems to be a sufficient testing procedure and should definitely be used in further chemical assessment...|$|E
