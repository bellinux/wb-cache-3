40|$|International audienceElectrical rotors {{are usually}} used in {{rotating}} machinery {{such as in}} ship engine pods. Designing such rotors in bending requires careful modeling of a <b>laminated</b> <b>stack</b> prestressed by tie rods. Theoretically, steel sheets, varnish layers and prestressing make it difficult to homogenize the constitutive properties of a stack both at rest and under operating conditions. Moreover, it is noteworthy that tie rods subjected to centrifugal forces bend until reaching annular clearance. Their nonlinear bending tends to increase their stiffening effects and the axial lamination load, therefore it affects the homogenized constitutive properties of a stack modeled with Timoshenko beams. By combining a fixed-point algorithm and penalty method at each speed of rotation, it is possible to plot the Campbell diagram and unbalance responses by considering updated properties and the axial load of the tie rods generated by centrifugal effects. An industrial application is used to show that centrifugal effects have a slight influence on rotor dynamics...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{introduces}} a mock-up {{with a solid}} iron cylinder rotating in a fixed excitation frame powered by dc current. A uniform field is created in the rotating cylinder, which is driven by an external motor. The braking torque is measured, allowing the study of iron losses generated by a uniform rotating field. The aim is to advance toward a vector iron loss model {{that takes into account}} different magnetization directions and their interdependency. The eddy current losses are the dominant loss source in the mock-up, rendering it easier to model. A standard eddy currents model is proposed. It models well the losses at low and medium magnetic flux density, but lower losses are measured near saturation levels. This could be due to the high thickness to radius ratio changing the eddy current paths near the edges of the rotor, which can be later analyzed by a full 3 -D finite-element method analysis. A 2 -D finite-element method simulation is performed, which estimates the magnetic flux heterogeneity in the rotor. Several lessons are drawn from this mock-up, which prepares a second version with a higher speed and a longer <b>laminated</b> <b>stack</b> rotor. A higher air gap will decrease the voltage fluctuation in the primary winding, a smaller angular opening of the excitation frame will improve the uniformity of the flux in the rotor...|$|E

This was done for quasi-isotropic layups of a toughened composite material. Experimental observations on changes in the impact damage state and postimpact compressive performance were presented for seven different <b>laminate</b> <b>stacking</b> sequences. The applicability and limitations of analysis compared to experimental results were also discussed. Postimpact compressive behavior {{was found to be}} a strong function of the <b>laminate</b> <b>stacking</b> sequence. This relationship was found to depend on thickness, stacking sequence, size, and location of sublaminates that comprise the impact damage state. The postimpact strength for specimens with a relatively symmetric distribution of damage through the laminate thickness was accurately predicted by models that accounted for sublaminate stability and in-plane stress redistribution. An asymmetric distribution of damage in some <b>laminate</b> <b>stacking</b> sequences tended to alter specimen stability.

Amongst other practical applications, modelling {{interactions between the}} steel sheets in industrial magnetic cores of electric motor stators is a complex task as it requires anticipating behavioural heterogeneities in the structure and possibly represents significantly costly operations for performing modal or dynamic response simulations. In this article, a method for identifying equivalent material properties to anisotropic structures is developed, able {{to take into account}} the influence of preloads and friction on the material properties, later used in structural dynamics simulations. The proposed approach can be used with superelements, converting stiffness matrices into elasticity matrices. The method is first applied to a triclinic model, and recreates its elasticity matrix with little derivation. Then, an equivalent linear material is computed for a continuous structure under preloading. Compared at low frequencies, the vibration behaviour of the preloaded structure and its equivalent effective media are in good agreement. The operation is repeated with a <b>laminated</b> <b>stack</b> under preload-ing. Again, the modal behaviour of the equivalent structure shows good accuracy compared to the initial preloaded stack. Finally, the magnetic core of an electric machine stator is modelled with equivalent anisotropic material properties, accounting for friction and preload in the yoke's and the teeth's steel sheets. The simulation of the structure's low-frequency radial vibration modes is satisfying, and shows improvement compared to orthotropic properties...|$|E
40|$|Soft Magnetic Composite (SMC) {{components}} produced {{based on}} traditional Powder Metallurgical (PM) techniques are strong candidate materials for electromagnetic applications. Their advantages {{are based on}} profitable and energy efficient production methods, shape complexity realization and uniquely uniform and isotropic 3 D magnetic properties. SMC powder grades consist of encapsulated iron powder particles with an ultra-fine, electrically insulating surface coating. Component manufacturing procedure involves compaction of the admixed SMC powder with a lubricant to a final shape, {{as well as a}} subsequent heat-treatment that aims on the relaxation of stresses induced during the compaction. The concept of SMC is based on taking advantage of the dielectric properties of the surface coating and creating a <b>laminated</b> <b>stack</b> in a powder form. In this manner, products with superior magnetic performances can be produced as opposed to the more traditional laminated steels and ferrites, due to the higher reduction of eddy currents especially at high frequency applications. It is obvious that the insulating coating is the paramount feature of the SMC technology. Its morphology, thickness, cohesion to the powder particle and durability during compaction and heat-treatment, are critical for the properties of a finished component. Hence, a methodology based on surface sensitive analytical techniques was developed in order to address these matters on a micro-level for such insulating coatings. Standard methods previously used for the powder surface characterization have been significantly modified due to the non-conductive nature of the surface coating, which led to charging during analysis. Charge compensation was confronted by adding slow electrons and software correction. Additionally two commonly used sample preparation techniques were implemented and compared. Surface chemical analysis and coating’s morphology characterisation were performed on commercially available water atomized SMC powder grades that were coated with a phosphate based inorganic glass. High resolution imaging combined with spectroscopic techniques and depth profiling (HR-SEM, EDX and XPS) provided complementary results for the coating characterisation. The chemical states of the main constituent elements of the coating, namely oxygen (O 1 s), iron (Fe 2 p) and phosphorous (P 2 p), were determined. Furthermore, two approaches to evaluate the coating thickness were followed based on the relationship between the normalized intensity of the iron metal peak and the etch depth where phosphorus and oxygen intensities reach half the difference of their maximum and minimum values. The results indicated the thickness of the coating to have an average value of approximately 30 nm. Moreover, HR SEM imaging as well as EDX analysis conditions for optimum analysis was established using low acceleration voltage (~ 5 kV) and inLens detector for secondary electron imaging. Results revealed a uniform coating morphology without the presence of any artifacts with good overall coverage and coherence to the iron core...|$|E
40|$|Soft Magnetic Composite (SMC) {{products}} {{manufactured by}} traditional Powder Metallurgical (PM) techniques, are strong candidate materials for electromagnetic applications. Their advantages are based on cost and energy efficient production methods, shape complexity realization and uniquely uniform and isotropic three dimensional (3 D) magnetic properties. SMC powder grades consist of individually encapsulated iron powder particles with an ultra-thin, electrically insulating surface coating. Component manufacturing procedure involves compaction of the admixed SMC base powder with a lubricant substance to a final shape, {{as well as a}} subsequent heat-treatment that aims at the relaxation of stresses induced during the compaction. The concept of SMC utilizes the insulating properties of the surface coating by creating a 3 D <b>laminated</b> <b>stack</b> in a powder form, which essentially aims in a higher reduction of the total core losses of the application. In this manner, products with comparable or superior magnetic performances can be produced as opposed to the more traditional laminated steels and ferrites, especially for high frequency applications. The electrical insulating coating, as well as the internal microstructure of the matrix powdered material, constitute two of the most important factors that control the final performance of an SMC product. Their state and its development through processing is crucial for tailoring the material to the desired properties. In the case of the coating, its morphology, thickness, cohesion to the powder surface and durability during compaction and annealing steps are all important aspects that contribute to the improvement of its functionality. Moreover, the degree of deformation, recrystallization and grain boundary interface related to the base material after treatment, are also heavily linked to its magnetic behavior. In the present study, methodologies along with theoretical modeling were developed initially based on analytical techniques, in order to assess and relate the aforementioned material properties to processing parameters such as compaction pressure, annealing temperature and composition of process atmosphere. For such purposes, both loose SMC base powder as well as compacted components were investigated before and after processing treatments in various conditions. The results of this thesis address the nature of the insulating coating, in terms of chemical composition and microstructure, while pointing out the underlying mechanism responsible for its stability under heat treatment. Furthermore, the development of the deformation state and internal microstructure of the SMC processed components was assessed in respect to their processing parameters and correlated to their measured core loses. These findings are important contributions, especially from an industrial point of view, in achieving optimal properties for such composite materials as well as designing an efficient processing route. The methods and knowledge developed here can also prove to be of interest for a wider range of PM concepts...|$|E

40|$|Space {{launcher}} vehicle {{structures are}} designed as thin walled cylindrical and conical structures which {{are prone to}} buckling and are sensitive towards geometrical imperfections. Small deviations in dimensions, which still are within manufacturing tolerances, {{may lead to a}} tremendous decrease in load carrying capacity. Thus, imperfections have to be considered during the design phase and this is commonly done using empirical knock down factors. Besides this approach, imperfections can be considered by applying numerical or analytical structural models. Composite materials are used to exploit the light weight potential of unstiffened thin walled structures. For this type of shell structure, the buckling load of the geometrically perfect shell and the imperfection sensitivity are significantly influenced by the <b>laminate</b> <b>stacking</b> sequence. In this paper, the influence of the <b>laminate</b> <b>stacking</b> sequence of composite shells with rotational symmetric imperfections on the buckling behavior is studied and <b>laminate</b> <b>stacking</b> sequences leading to the highest buckling loads of an imperfect shell structure are identified.

40|$|Shell {{structures}} {{are used as}} primary structures of space launch vehicles. These {{structures are}} thin-walled and are thus prone to buckling when loaded in compression. Because of the imperfection sensitivity of these structures, small deviations of the real shell from the theoretically perfect shell {{may result in a}} tremendous decrease in load carrying capacity. For this reason, geometrical imperfections need {{to be taken into account}}. When designing unstiffened composite shells, the <b>laminate</b> <b>stacking</b> sequence influences both, the buckling load of the geometrically perfect shell and the imperfection sensitivity of the shell. Consequently, to derive <b>laminate</b> <b>stacking</b> sequences that maximize the buckling load of real shell structures, geometrical imperfections need to be taken into account already in an early design phase. In this paper, two <b>laminate</b> <b>stacking</b> sequences that were derived to maximize the buckling load of the geometrically perfect and imperfect shell structure are studied using stochastic methods. To this end, combination of non-rotational symmetric imperfections derived from measured data and variations of the ply orientation are studied in a stochastic analysis on basis of Monte Carlo simulations. The results of this study will be used to evaluate the influence of the stacking sequence as one of the essential properties dominating the structural response of geometrically imperfect laminate composite shell structures.

40|$|State {{of the art}} in {{multi-stage}} {{production systems}} is End-Of-Line (EOL) quality control. The main drawback of EOL inspection is the off-line inspection at {{the final stage of}} the manufacturing chain, where already all possible defects of the production chain have been accumulated. Thus, a defective workpiece is machined wasting time, money and energy resources for creating a final product, which is out of tolerances and has to be recycled or scrapped. To overcome this drawback it is necessary to create solutions to reduce either defect generation or defect propagation. This paper focusses on the second approach, which aims at repairing defective workpieces by adapting consecutive process parameters in a multi-stage production system (downstream repair). By applying this concept to the production of electrical drives for power train applications, the effort needed for EOL testing can be reduced by shifting testing steps into the previous process chain. The currently used total flux measurement of <b>laminated</b> steel <b>stacks</b> is replaced by a space-resolved measurement. This permits the identification and local allocation of deviations in the magnetic field due to defective or weak magnets. The downstream repair strategy solves an optimization problem in order to compensate deviations in the magnetic field of single <b>laminated</b> steel <b>stacks</b> by adapting the assembly stage. Two repair strategies are discussed within this paper, namely sequential and selective assembly. In the proper assembling sequence, the <b>laminated</b> steel <b>stacks</b> are then assembled on the rotor according to the optimal assembling policy.
