The motor cars were about twice as heavy as the trailer cars, and the trailers were significantly more top-heavy, especially with a passenger load. Standard procedure was to never couple two trailer cars together, but to always have a single trailer between two motor cars. The heavier motor cars provided stability for the <b>lighter</b> <b>trailers.</b> In the Malbone Street wreck train, two trailers were coupled together, and it was these two cars, in order numbers 80 and 100, that sustained {{the bulk of the}} damage, both to the cars and to the passengers.|$|R

40|$|The rising {{greenhouse}} gas emissions {{at a global level}} have caused the increasing interest in cleaner and less oil-dependent transportation sources. It has been carried out a lot of researches on the alternative energy sources, like biofuels, fuel cells, wind farms, etc. and on the clean vehicles (hybrids). Most major manufacturers have successfully introduced hybrid automobiles utilizing electric motors and an internal combustion engine to improve their gas mileage. To decrease the use of gasoline even further, some hybrids are being retrofitted to allow them to be plugged-into a standard i. e. 120 -volt socket to charge the batteries and potentially to provide power back to the electric grid when needed. Plug-in Hybrid Cars offer the fuel-efficiency benefits of hybrid cars with the added feature of being able to plug-in to household electricity during rest. This allows the increased mileage and fuel savings. Plug-ins requires larger batteries than normal hybrids, which drives up their cost. Lithium-ion batteries are smaller, have a higher output of energy but are more expensive than rechargeable nickel metal hydride (NiMh), still used in hybrid vehicles. Improvement in battery storage capacity is of the most importance for the plug-ins. Plug-in technology is developed by the major auto manufacturers, with working prototypes of both plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) and plug-in electric vehicles possessing small backup gas generators. The aim of the paper has been to assess the dynamic performance characteristics of the assembly <b>light</b> <b>trailer</b> car with classic combustion engine (in the first case) o...|$|E

40|$|Para determinar el impacto del trÃ¡fico sobre el suelo, el cultivo y el consumo energÃ©tico durante la cosecha de caÃ±a de azÃºcar en el valle del rÃ­o Cauca (Colombia), se establecieron experimentos de cuatro repeticiones con diferentes sistemas de cosecha. En cada sitio se cosecharon mecÃ¡nicamente parcelas con vagones de auto volteo, HD 8000, HD 12000 y HD 20000, se evaluaron por la intensidad de trÃ¡fico (IT), el pisoteo directo sobre la cepa, la resistencia a la penetraciÃ³n y el consumo energÃ©tico. Vagones grandes y pesados causaron mayor IT y mayor efecto por compactaciÃ³n y pisoteo. La IT variÃ³ entre 241 y 317 Mg km ha- 1. El pisoteo en la cabecera variÃ³ de 8 a 18 m por surco y sobre la cepa los vagones pisaron entre 5 y 24 % de su ancho. Hubo diferencias no significativas en productividad hasta de 13, 9 % {{favorable}} a los vagones livianos. En cosecha semimecÃ¡nica, realizada con trenes de vagones, disminuyÃ³ la IT al rango 60 - 113 Mg km ha- 1; pero aumentÃ³ el pisoteo en las cabeceras hasta 39 m por surco, hubo diferencias no significativas en productividad hasta del 4 % entre sistemas de vagones livianos y pesados. AdemÃ¡s, los vagones livianos con manejo adecuado de la cosecha, llegan a ser favorables por menor consumo de combustible y emisiones. This {{study was}} carried out to determine the impact of traffic on soil compaction, crop and energy consumption during the sugarcane harvest in the Cauca river valley (Colombia). Four experiments with four replicates were harvested with different systems. Plots were mechanically harvested with self tipping, HD 8000, HD 12000 and HD 20000 trailers and evaluated by traffic intensity (IT), direct stool traffic, penetration resistance and fuel consumption. Heavy trailers caused a greater effect due to a greater IT and direct stool traffic. IT varied between 241 and 317 Mg km ha- 1. Stool traffic {{at the end of}} field varied from 8 to 18 m per furrow, meanwhile stool traffic along the furrow varied from 5 to 24 %. There were no significant differences for productivity up to 13. 9 % favoring <b>light</b> <b>trailers.</b> Semi-mechanical harvesting was realized with trains of trailers, IT fell down to a 60 - 113 Mg km ha- 1 range because a larger area is harvested during one pass of the equipment, but stool traffic increased up to 39 m per furrow for the longer trains, there was a 4 % non significant difference for productivity from <b>light</b> to heavy <b>trailers.</b> Furthermore, <b>light</b> <b>trailers</b> with an adequate management are better options with lower energy consumption and emissions...|$|R
