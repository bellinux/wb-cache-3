40|$|Background Inadequate {{levels of}} {{immunization}} against childhood diseases remain a significant {{public health problem}} in resource-poor areas of the globe. Nonetheless, the reasons <b>for</b> incomplete <b>vaccination</b> and non-uptake of immunization services are poorly understood. This study aimed at finding out the reasons for non-vaccination and the magnitude of missed opportunities <b>for</b> <b>vaccination</b> in children {{less than two years}} of age in a rural area in southern Mozambique. Methods Mothers of children under two years of age (N = 668) were interviewed in a cross-sectional study. The Road-to-Health card was utilized to check for completeness and correctness of vaccination schedule as well as for identifying the appropriate use of all available opportunities <b>for</b> <b>vaccination.</b> The chi-square test and the logistic regression were used for statistical analysis. Results We found that 28. 2 % of the children had not completed the vaccination program by two years of age, 25. 7 % had experienced a missed opportunity <b>for</b> <b>vaccination</b> and 14. 9 % were incorrectly vaccinated. Reasons <b>for</b> incomplete <b>vaccination</b> were associated with accessibility to the vaccination sites, no schooling of mothers and children born at home or outside Mozambique. Conclusion Efforts to increase vaccination coverage should take into account factors that contribute to the incomplete vaccination status of children. Missed opportunities <b>for</b> <b>vaccination</b> and incorrect vaccination need to be avoided in order to increase the vaccine coverage for those clients that reach the health facility, specially in those countries where health services do not have 100 % of coverage...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Recent {{report on}} {{existence}} of a stem region of hemagglutinin has arisen new hopes <b>for</b> <b>vaccination</b> of influenza A as it consist of a conserve fusion peptide shared across several influenza subtypes {{and can be targeted}} by human immune system. Methods: Given that traditional vaccination based on live attenuated viruses often fails to surpass such viral infection, {{a great deal of attention}} has been devoted to develop a safe yet efficient system <b>for</b> <b>vaccination</b> influenza A. We believe that a natural bioshuttle can be recruited <b>for</b> spontaneous mass <b>vaccination.</b> Results: Thus, here, we hypothesize that a bioengineered transgenic Hirudo medicinalis can be considered as an alive bioshuttle <b>for</b> in-situ <b>vaccination</b> against influenza A virus. By introducing the designated gene(s) encoding the target fragment (i. e., stem region of hemagglutinin), this microsurgeon can act as a rapid microproducer of viral proteins <b>for</b> in-house mass <b>vaccination</b> through imparting the necessary proteins such as those, naturally presented in leech's saliva. Conclusion: This peculiar bioshuttle can be easily exploited as a medical modality choice at home resulting in greater patient compliance...|$|R
