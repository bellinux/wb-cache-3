A new, high-precision dating method developed by the team allows better correlation of the various factors involved and puts the ice core chronologies on a stronger temporal footing, endorsing the traditional Milankovitch hypothesis, that climate variations are controlled by insolation in the northern hemisphere. The new chronology is inconsistent with the [...] "inclination" [...] theory of the 100,000-year cycle. The establishment of <b>leads</b> <b>and</b> <b>lags</b> against different orbital forcing components with this method—which uses the direct insolation control over nitrogen-oxygen ratios in ice core bubbles—is in principle a great improvement in the temporal resolution of these records and another significant validation of the Milankovitch hypothesis. An international climate modelling exercise (Abe-ouchi et al., Nature, 2013) demonstrated that climate models can replicate the 100,000-year cyclicity given the orbital forcing and carbon dioxide levels of the late Pleistocene. The isostatic history of ice sheets was implicated in mediating the 100,000-year response to the orbital forcing. Larger ice sheets are lower in elevation because they depress the continental crust upon which they sit, {{and are therefore more}} vulnerable to melting.|$|E

The usefulness of capacity utilization is also investigated but the variable is not given a prominent status. The number of independent cycles - there may be more than one - and the frequencies retained in the cycles are not restricted a priori. To allow for <b>leads</b> <b>and</b> <b>lags</b> between variables, phase shifts 0 la R are introduced at a later stage. Additivity of <b>leads</b> <b>and</b> <b>lags</b> is not imposed. Over 1983 - 2004, a 3. 5 years periodicity is found in the cycles. At that periodicity, the cycles in the participation and unemployment rates are negligible. Two independent cycles hide behind the cycles of the other variables: hours, TFP and capacity utilization. A common cycle restriction is rejected, even allowing for idiosyncratic cycles. The cycles present in the whole data set cannot be subsumed in a single measure such as capacity utilization. Phase shifts are significant, with hours leading by as much as 3 quarters and capacity utilization lagging but additivity of <b>leads</b> <b>and</b> <b>lags</b> is rejected.

40|$|We extend Dechow and Dichev’s [2002] {{model of}} current {{accruals}} quality (CAQ) to consider total accruals quality (TAQ). While {{the two measures}} are conceptually similar (both reflect the standard deviation of the residuals from the mapping of accruals into <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> <b>lag</b> cash flows), they differ {{in terms of the}} definitions of accruals and cash flows as well as the number of <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> <b>lag</b> cash flow terms. We find that TAQ is significantly larger than CAQ, indicating that non-current accruals are of lower quality than current accruals. Correlation tests show that CAQ serves as a reliable instrument for TAQ, insofar as we document economically large and statistically positive correlations between the two variables. These correlations vary across industries, and are stronger when total accruals are relatively smaller in absolute value. The latter is consistent with the view that smaller magnitudes of total accruals imply less estimation error...|$|R
40|$|The Time Tradeoff (TTO) {{method is}} used to {{calculate}} the quality adjustment of the Quality Adjusted Life Year, and is therefore an important element in the calculation of the benefits of medical interventions. New specifications of TTO, known as ‘lead time’ TTO and ‘lag time’ TTO, have been developed to overcome methodological issues of the ‘classic’ TTO. In the lead time TTO, ill-health is explicitly placed in the future, after a period of good health, while in lag time TTO a health state starts immediately and is followed by a ‘lag time’ of good health. In this study, we take advantage of these timing properties of <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> <b>lag</b> time TTO. In particular, we use data from a previous study that employed <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> <b>lag</b> time TTO to estimate their implied discounting parameters. We show that individuals prefer being ill later, rather than now, with larger per-period discount rates for longer durations of the health states. ...|$|R

This paper justifies using the conventional formulas of those model selection criteria for the leads-and-lags cointegrating regression. The numbers of <b>leads</b> <b>and</b> <b>lags</b> can be selected in scientific ways using the model selection criteria. Simulation results regarding the bias and mean squared error of the long-run coefficient estimates are reported. It is found that the model selection criteria are successful in reducing bias and mean squared error relative to the conventional, fixed selection rules. Among the model selection criteria, the BIC appears to be most successful in reducing MSE, and Cp in reducing bias. We also observe that, in most cases, the selection rules without the restriction that the numbers of the <b>leads</b> <b>and</b> <b>lags</b> be the same have an advantage over those with it. グローバルCOEプログラム = Global COE Progra...|$|E

40|$|Objective. The {{phenomenon}} of pendelluft was described over five decades ago. In patients with regional variations in resistance and elastance, gas moves {{at the beginning}} of inspiration out of some alveoli into others. Gas moves in the opposite direction at the end of inspiration. The objective {{of this study was to}} apply the method of lung sounds mapping, which is known to provide regional information about gas flow, to study pendelluft in COPD patients. Methods. A 16 -channel lung sound analyzer was used to collect sounds from patients with COPD (n = 90) and age-matched normals (n = 90). Pendelluft {{at the beginning of}} inspiration is expected to result in vesicular sounds leading the tracheal sound by a few milliseconds. Pendelluft at the end of inspiration is expected to result in vesicular sounds lagging the tracheal sound. These <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> <b>lag</b> times were calculated for the 14 chest wall sites. Results. The lead time was significantly longer in COPD patients: 123 ± 107 [*]ms versus 48 ± 59 [*]ms in controls (P < 0. 0001). The lag time was also significantly longer in COPD patients: 269 ± 249 [*]ms in COPD patients versus 147 ± 124 [*]ms in controls (P < 0. 0001). When normalized by the duration of the inspiration at the trachea, the lead was 14 ± 13 % for COPD versus 4 ± 5 % for controls (P < 0. 0001). The lag was 28 ± 25 % for COPD versus 13 ± 12 % for controls (P < 0. 0001). Both <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> <b>lag</b> correlated moderately with the GOLD stage (correlation coefficient 0. 43).
