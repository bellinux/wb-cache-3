5|$|The Turnpike Commission {{announced}} plans to consider eliminating manned toll booths in favor of all-electronic tolls. With this, tolls will be paid using either E-ZPass or credit cards. Drivers unable to pay by either of these methods will be billed in the mail using <b>license</b> <b>plate</b> recognition; an additional surcharge will be applied. In addition to E-ZPass, the turnpike commission offered other automated options to pay for tolls such as using a prepaid account that utilizes <b>license</b> <b>plate</b> recognition. McCormick Taylor and Wilbur Smith Associates have been hired to conduct a feasibility study on converting the road to all-electronic tolls.|$|E

50|$|Using bogus <b>license</b> <b>plates</b> {{and driving}} {{documents}} - Law enforcement officials have noted Little Shell <b>license</b> <b>plates</b> around the country. In July 2003, for example, five residents of Barnes County, North Dakota, were arrested after being caught with fake drivers licenses, registrations and insurance cards {{issued by the}} Little Shell Band. The <b>license</b> <b>plates</b> may easily be confused with legitimate tribal <b>license</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|R
25|$|When {{a vehicle}} is sold, the {{disposition}} of the <b>license</b> <b>plates</b> depends on state law and varies by state. In some states, <b>license</b> <b>plates</b> are transferred with the vehicle to its new owner. In other states, the <b>license</b> <b>plates</b> remain with the seller, who may, for a fee, transfer the <b>license</b> <b>plates</b> and any unused portion of the current registration to a new vehicle. Some states issue a new plate whenever the car is sold.|$|R

5|$|Beginning in 1986 Idaho {{license plates}} {{depicted}} a basic mountain range {{that was supposed}} to represent the Sawtooths; in 1991 the plates were revised to more accurately represent the mountains. The Idaho Division of Motor Vehicles also created a <b>license</b> <b>plate</b> depicting the SNRA.|$|E
5|$|Other {{legislation}} {{sponsored by}} Gibbs included bills to extend Colorado's habitat stamp program, {{to create a}} specialty <b>license</b> <b>plate</b> for skiing and snowboarding, to overhaul regulations on oil and gas drilling operations, and to facilitate local planning and fundraising for fighting wildfires.|$|E

After each driver's term, the driver gets to keep the two pennants as well.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{popularity}} of the film's cars with customizers and hot rodders in the years since its release, their fate immediately after the film is ironic. All were offered for sale in San Francisco newspaper ads; only the '58 Impala (driven by Ronny Howard) attracted a buyer, selling for only a few hundred dollars. The yellow Deuce and the white T-bird went unsold, despite being priced as low as US$3,000. The registration plate on Milner's yellow deuce coupe is THX138 on a yellow, California <b>license</b> <b>plate,</b> slightly altered, reflecting Lucas's earlier science fiction film.|$|E
5|$|Pigozzi {{maintained}} {{a schedule of}} year-to-year model revisions, much like US manufacturers. For 1956, an estate version called the Simca Vedette Marly joined the line-up and the whole range was revised. A new <b>license</b> <b>plate</b> holder {{was added to the}} front bumper and the rear <b>license</b> <b>plate</b> now concealed the fuel tank filler. A peculiar addition was a pedal-operated windscreen washer, while other more ordinary changes included a second odometer, also known as a 'trip meter', for measuring partial distances. The Versailles and Régence were made even more comfortable with the addition of central armrests (Versailles in the rear only, Régence in front and rear), while the Trianon was simplified, losing bumper guards and chrome windscreen decor. In 1957, an option of the Gravina automatic clutch was added, along with better brakes and more direct steering. The Trianon regained the chrome decor around the windscreen, while the other models acquired slimmer tail lights and the front ornament was replaced with a new design. Fender-mounted V8 badges were introduced but, although the whole range featured the same V8 engine, the new badges appeared on the fenders of only the Régence and Marly.|$|E
50|$|From 1 April 1900 to 3 March 1913 {{regional}} <b>license</b> <b>plates</b> {{with only}} digits were in use.

All vehicle <b>license</b> <b>plates</b> in Brunei, other than those issued to royalty, diplomats and taxis (see below), have white characters on a black background, regardless of the vehicle type.|$|R
5|$|The Pennsylvania Turnpike {{uses the}} ticket system of tolling between the Warrendale and Neshaminy Falls toll plazas, {{as well as}} on the Northeast Extension to Wyoming Valley. When {{entering}} the turnpike, motorists receive a ticket listing the toll for each exit; the ticket is surrendered when exiting, and the applicable toll is paid. If the ticket is lost, motorists are charged the maximum toll for that exit. Cash, credit cards, and E-ZPass are accepted at traditional toll plazas. An eastbound mainline toll plaza is located at Gateway near the Ohio border, charging a flat toll using cash or E-ZPass, and an all-electronic westbound mainline toll gantry is located at the Delaware River Bridge near the New Jersey border, charging a flat toll using TOLL BY PLATE (which uses automatic <b>license</b> <b>plate</b> recognition to take a photo of the vehicle's <b>license</b> <b>plate</b> and mail a bill to the vehicle owner) or E-ZPass at highway speeds. There is no toll between Gateway and Warrendale and between Neshaminy Falls and the Delaware River Bridge. The PA29 interchange and the westbound Virginia Drive and eastbound Street Road interchanges only accept E-ZPass.|$|E
5|$|The turnpike {{commission}} {{announced plans}} to consider eliminating manned toll booths in favor of all-electronic tolls. With this system, tolls will be paid with E-ZPass or credit cards. Drivers unable to pay by either method will be billed by mail (using <b>license</b> <b>plate</b> recognition), and a surcharge will be imposed. In addition to E-ZPass, the turnpike commission offered other automated options to pay for tolls such as using a prepaid account that utilizes <b>license</b> <b>plate</b> recognition. McCormick Taylor and Wilbur Smith Associates have been hired to conduct a feasibility study on converting the road to all-electronic tolls. On March 6, 2012, the turnpike commission {{announced that it was}} implementing an all-electronic tolling plan. The turnpike commission will save $65million annually on labor costs by eliminating toll collectors. Plans call for a 76-percent surcharge on motorists without E-ZPass who are billed by mail; this surcharge could raise the toll for a motorist without E-ZPass to well over $50 to travel the entire turnpike. On January 3, 2016, all-electronic tolling was introduced in the westbound direction at the Delaware River Bridge mainline toll plaza, while the eastern terminus of the ticket system was moved from the Delaware River Bridge to Neshaminy Falls.|$|E
5|$|At Mars Investigations, Duncan and Lilly's mother, Celeste Kane (Lisa Thornhill) hires Keith to {{ascertain}} if her husband Jake {{is having an}} affair, despite her open contempt for both Keith and Veronica. Keith is busy with other projects, and Veronica takes it upon herself to follow Jake. Veronica takes photos of him at the Camelot hotel as he meets with an unseen woman after midnight. Once Keith sees the <b>license</b> <b>plate</b> number of the woman's car, he stops the investigation and files the photograph. Puzzled by his actions, Veronica finds the file and learns that Keith has continued his own personal investigation of Lilly's murder. Veronica discovers that the car belongs to her missing mother, Lianne, and begins to investigate the murder herself.|$|E

5|$|Besides {{the main}} storyline being a retelling of the Hansel and Gretel fairytale, the episode {{contained}} {{a number of}} other cultural references. A rack full of Marvel Comics, including Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk, are shown in the opening scene, a double reference to both Marvel's parent company, Disney and the comic book's writer, Damon Lindelof, co-creator of Lost. An Apollo Bar was among the stolen items, and the Stranger's motorcycle <b>license</b> <b>plate</b> reads 23, both also references to Lost. Other comic books seen on the convenience store rack include various issues of Dazzler, Power Pack, West Coast Avengers, and Ka-Zar.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to improve air quality, the city placed {{restrictions}} on construction sites and gas stations, and limited the use of commercial and passenger vehicles in Beijing. From 20 June through 20 September, passenger vehicle restrictions were placed on alternate days depending on the terminal digit of the car's <b>license</b> <b>plate.</b> It was anticipated that this measure would take 45% of Beijing's 3.3million cars off the streets. The boosted public transport network was expected to absorb the demand created by these restrictions and the influx of visitors, which was estimated at more than 4million additional passengers per day.|$|E
5|$|The {{other two}} clones are then {{seen in a}} forest – one walks behind a tree and reappears dressed in casual attire. He climbs another tree and {{ends up in the}} {{bathroom}} of the woman's apartment, where he retrieves a package. The clone then crawls underneath her bed and finds himself underneath a car. He opens the package and finds a gasoline can, which he pours into a compartment located behind the car's <b>license</b> <b>plate.</b> All three clones enter the car and drive to the box, which they step back into; the video concludes with the box's explosion.|$|E
40|$|As <b>license</b> <b>plates</b> {{emblazoned with}} the message “Choose Life” have proliferated in twenty-four states, so too have {{lawsuits}} challenging such specialty <b>license</b> <b>plates.</b> The holdings of such cases have run the gamut, resulting in a three-way circuit split among the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits. Analysis of the controversy {{up to this point}} has not considered an illuminating analogy: advertising space owned and operated by the government. Examining the parallels between advertising space and specialty <b>license</b> <b>plates</b> informs doctrinal analysis of the dispute, demonstrating that state legislatures may not use the current practice of individually establishing specialty <b>license</b> <b>plates</b> through statute, but must instead choose acceptable subjects to appear on <b>license</b> <b>plates,</b> leaving individual applications under the care of a neutral administrator...|$|R
50|$|Up until 1999 when Colorado ceased coding <b>license</b> <b>plates</b> by county, Adams County {{used the}} {{following}} codes on <b>license</b> <b>plates</b> issued to passenger vehicles: TE-UF, GA-GG, SAA-SEW, and SEY-TZZ.|$|R

5|$|Timoshenko and his partner, Officer Herman Yan, {{had been}} driving in a marked 71st precinct police car on a routine patrol in Crown Heights, with Timoshenko riding as the {{passenger}} when they spotted a 2003 black BMW sports utility vehicle headed westbound on Lefferts Avenue at 2:30 am. The officers scanned the BMW's <b>license</b> <b>plate</b> on a computer in their police car. When the check came back, it indicated that the plate was assigned to a 2007 Mitsubishi Outlander, not the BMW. Timoshenko and Yan signaled for the vehicle to pull over, and the driver complied, turning north onto Rogers Avenue, where both officers got out of their car and approached the stopped vehicle.|$|E

After a few drinks, they decide to dig up the backyard together, quickly finding another bone and a <b>license</b> <b>plate.</b> Phil, who is skeptical about the digging, leaves with Adam and Paul as Alicia (Anna Kendrick), Max (Brie Larson) and Billy (Chris Messina) arrive at the house. Billy pairs off with Alicia and Ray with Max while Tim continues to dig. He finds a shoe before deciding to go to sleep.|$|E
5|$|Father John {{returns to}} the red-light {{district}} and speaks to a prostitute named Miriam (Greta Oglesby), who suggests a powerful pimp named James St. Clair (Ansa Akyea) might know about the woman. As they speak in a bar, the mysterious prostitute enters and solicits a john (Patrick Coyle), who leaves with her immediately. As she goes, Father John catches {{a glimpse of the}} crucifix she is wearing and tries to chase her down. She leaves in the john's car before he can catch them, but he writes down the <b>license</b> <b>plate</b> as they drive off. Back at church, his sermons start to grow more unorthodox, and Father Ralph warns him that his unusual church manner and trips to the red-light district have the archbishop concerned. Meanwhile, Father John is contacted by his ex-girlfriend Nadine Brennan (Amy Matthews), who tells him she is divorcing her husband and still harbors romantic feelings for Father John.|$|E
