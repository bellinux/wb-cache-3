40|$|BACKGROUND: Degenerative <b>lumbosacral</b> <b>stenosis</b> is {{a common}} problem in large breed dogs. For severe {{degenerative}} <b>lumbosacral</b> <b>stenosis,</b> conservative treatment is often not effective and surgical intervention remains as the last treatment option. The objective of this retrospective study {{was to assess the}} middle to long term outcome of treatment of severe degenerative <b>lumbosacral</b> <b>stenosis</b> with pedicle screw-rod fixation with or without evidence of radiological discospondylitis. RESULTS: Twelve client-owned dogs with severe degenerative <b>lumbosacral</b> <b>stenosis</b> underwent pedicle screw-rod fixation of the lumbosacral junction. During long term follow-up, dogs were monitored by clinical evaluation, diagnostic imaging, force plate analysis, and by using questionnaires to owners. Clinical evaluation, force plate data, and responses to questionnaires completed by the owners showed resolution (n[*]=[*] 8) or improvement (n[*]=[*] 4) of clinical signs after pedicle screw-rod fixation in 12 dogs. There were no implant failures, however, no interbody vertebral bone fusion of the lumbosacral junction was observed in the follow-up period. Four dogs developed mild recurrent low back pain that could easily be controlled by pain medication and an altered exercise regime. CONCLUSIONS: Pedicle screw-rod fixation offers a surgical treatment option for large breed dogs with severe degenerative <b>lumbosacral</b> <b>stenosis</b> with or without evidence of radiological discospondylitis in which no other treatment is available. Pedicle screw-rod fixation alone does not result in interbody vertebral bone fusion between L 7 and S 1...|$|E

Conventional T 1 -weighted imaging (T 1 WI) and T 2 -weighted imaging (T 2 WI) scans are commonly used to image spinal cord degeneration. However, these modalities are unable to image the entire lumbosacral spinal nerve roots. Thus, in the present study, we assessed the potential of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for quantitative assessment of compressed lumbosacral spinal nerve roots. Subjects were 20 young healthy volunteers and 31 patients with <b>lumbosacral</b> <b>stenosis.</b> T 2 WI showed that the residual dural sac area was less than two-thirds that of the corresponding normal area in patients from L 3 to S 1 stenosis. On T 1 WI and T 2 WI, 74 lumbosacral spinal nerve roots from 31 patients showed compression changes. DTI showed thinning and distortion in 36 lumbosacral spinal nerve roots (49 %) and abruption in 17 lumbosacral spinal nerve roots (23 %). Moreover, fractional anisotropy values were reduced in the lumbosacral spinal nerve roots of patients with <b>lumbosacral</b> <b>stenosis.</b> These findings suggest that DTI can objectively and quantitatively evaluate the severity of lumbosacral spinal nerve root compression...|$|E

This article reviews the management of this disorder and highlights the most important new findings of the last decade. Dogs with DLSS are typically neuro-orthopedic patients and can be presented with varying clinical signs, of which the most consistent is lumbosacral pain. Due to the availability of advanced imaging techniques such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging that allow visualization of intervertebral disc degeneration, cauda equina compression, and nerve root entrapment, tailor-made treatments can be adopted for the individual patient. Current therapies include conservative treatment, decompressive surgery, and fixation-fusion of the L 7 -S 1 junction. New insight into the biomechanics and pathobiology of DLSS and developments in minimally invasive surgical techniques will influence treatment options in the near future.

Angled cross-sectional imaging of the neuroforamina has been found improve {{the accuracy of the}} diagnosis of stenosis in humans. In this anatomic study, foraminal apertures were evaluated by MRI at the entry, middle, and exit zones of the nerve roots in 30 dogs that were clinically affected by lumbosacral disease. Standard vs. oblique planar orientation and neutral vs. hyperextended positioning of the lumbosacral area were compared by measuring the median values for entry, middle, and exit zones. The neuroforaminal area acquired using oblique plane acquisition was significantly smaller than standard parasagittal measurements. Furthermore, standard parasagittal neuroforaminal dimensions in the hyperextended position were significantly smaller than standard parasagittal measurements in the neutral position. This statistical difference was even more pronounced for neuroforaminal dimension evaluated in the oblique plane and hyperextended position. Positioning of the dog during imaging has a significant effect on neuroforaminal dimension, corroborating the notion that spinal position may influence neural claudication in clinically affected patients. Reductions in neuroforaminal dimension are more evident on oblique planar image acquisition, suggesting that this approach may be more useful than parasagittal imaging as a tool for identifying subtle changes in L 7 neuroforaminal dimensions in cases of canine <b>lumbosacral</b> <b>stenosis...</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{prospective}} study on 409 {{patients who received}} multimodel intraoperative monitoring (MIOM) during lumbosacral surgical procedures between March 2000 and December 2005 was carried out. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the sensitivity and specificity of MIOM techniques used to monitor conus medullaris, cauda equina and nerve root function during lumbosacral decompression surgery. MIOM has increasingly become important to monitor ascending and descending pathways, giving immediate feedback information regarding any neurological deficit during the decompression and stabilisation procedure in the lumbosacral region. Intraoperative spinal- and cortical-evoked potentials, combined with continuous EMG- and motor-evoked potentials of the muscles, were evaluated and compared with postoperative clinical neurological changes. A total of 409 consecutive patients with <b>lumbosacral</b> spinal <b>stenosis</b> with or without instability were monitored by MIOM during the entire surgical procedure. A total of 388 patients presented true-negative findings while two patients presented false negative and 1 patient false-positive findings. Eighteen patients presented true-positive findings where neurological deficit after the operation was intraoperatively predicted. Of the 18 true-positive findings, 12 patients recovered completely; however, 6 patients recovered only partially. The sensitivity of MIOM applied during decompression and fusion surgery of the lumbosacral region was calculated as 90 %, and the specificity was calculated as 99. 7 %. On the basis of the results of this study, MIOM is an effective method of monitoring the conus medullaris, cauda equina and nerve root function during surgery at the lumbosacral junctions and might reduce postoperative surgical-related complications and therefore improve the long-term results...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this biomechanical {{study was to investigate}} the effect of decompressive surgery, specifically dorsal laminectomy and discectomy, on the stability of the lumbosacral joint in the dog. Different size laminectomies were compared with respect to their effect on lumbosacral stability. A total of eighteen lumbosacral motion units were collected from cadavers and divided into three groups. Group 1 was a control group and received no modification, Group 2 specimens received mini-dorsal laminectomies and discectomies (lamina of L 7 caudal to the dorsal spinous process excised, lamina of S 1 not affected) while Group 3 specimens received standard dorsal laminectomies and discectomies (75 % of L 7 lamina and 50 % of S 1 lamina excised). All specimens were potted in aluminium tubing and mounted in a four-point bending jig and tested in a load cell. Specimens were stressed to 21 ° in dorsiflexion and ventroflexion. The relevant surgical modification was then performed and the specimens re-tested to 21 ° in dorsiflexion and ventroflexion. All specimens were then tested to failure in ventroflexion. Force and angular displacement was recorded and used to obtain load-deformation curves for each specimen (5 curves for each specimen). From the load-deformation curves the stiffness (gradient of the graph) was determined at three set angles of deflection. These points were 6 °- 8 °, 12 °- 16 ° and 18 °- 20 °. The percentage change in stiffness for each specimen in both dorsiflexion and ventroflexion was obtained. Peak force at failure and angular deformation at failure were obtained when tested to failure in ventroflexion. When examining the overall stiffness of the specimen (dorsiflexion and ventroflexion and all angles of deflection) mini-dorsal laminectomy was shown to result in a 48. 3 % reduction in stiffness (P < 0. 001) while standard dorsal laminectomy and discectomy resulted in a 59. 8 % reduction in stiffness (P < 0. 001). These results were statistically significant. The difference between the two different types of laminectomies could be described as approaching significance (P= 0. 066). Larger group size would be required to determine whether this is in fact statistically significant Dorsal laminectomy combined with discectomy does {{have an effect on the}} stability of the lumbosacral joint.

METHODS Dogs with neurologic and {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) findings compatible with DLSS treated by dorsal laminectomy, partial discectomy and transarticular screw fixation were enrolled. Pre- and postoperative neurologic status was compared. Lumbosacral (LS) angle in extension and misalignment in preoperative MRI were compared with the postoperative CT. Residual mobility of the LS joint after fixation was also evaluated. Status of screws, presence of new bone formation over screw heads/articular facets and presence of adjacent segment disease (ASD) were assessed. RESULTS Median CT follow-up was 12 months.

The foraminal enlargement in the cadavers and the patient was documented on postoperative CT scans. The preoperative CT scan of the patient showed moderate cranial telescoping of the sacral roof and a moderate central disk protrusion, leading to moderate to severe compression of the cauda equina. In addition, there was lateral spondylosis with consequential stenosis of the right LS foramen. The right L 7 nerve had lost its fat attenuation and appeared thickened. After a routine L 7 S 1 dorsal laminectomy with a partial discectomy, a CCIO was performed, providing good access to the LS foramen and the adhesions around the proximal L 7 nerve caudoventral to the foramen.

40|$|Various news {{articles}} and documentaries on television had drawn {{the attention of}} the public to the health and welfare problems of pedigree dogs. Due to the criticism of the public towards breeders and the Dutch Kennel Club, the Ministry of Economic Affairs started a project in co-operation with the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of Utrecht University to make an assessment of the incidence of inherited disorders and disorders related to breed standards in the most common dog breeds in the Netherlands. Parallel to this project, the LICG (‘Landelijk Informatie Centrum Gezelschapsdieren’) started a project called: ‘Rashondengids’. The aim of this project is to inform future dog owners and breeders about the various disorders important in popular dog breeds in the Netherlands. In this study a qualitative assessment is made of these disorders in four popular dog breeds in the Netherlands: the Frisian Stabyhoun, German Shepherd, Golden Retriever and Staffordshire Bull Terrier. Current study focuses on the following question: Which possible inherited disorders and disorders related to breedstandards of Frisian Stabyhoun, Golden Retrievers, German Shepherds and Staffordshire Bull Terriers are described in the literature and to which degree are these disorders important in the Dutch population? In order to make such an assessment, a literature study has been conducted focussing on the described (inherited) disorders of the four breeds. A statistical analysis of the database of the UKG (Universiteitskliniek Gezelschapsdieren) was performed to get better insight in the disorders that could be important in the Dutch population. Combining these results has given an indication of the most important (inherited) disorders in these four breeds in the Netherlands. The most important diseases for the Frisian Stabyhoun are: patent ductus arteriosus, cerebral dysfunction and epilepsy. For the German Shepherd are the most important diseases: canine atopy, exocrine pancreas insufficiency, degenerative <b>lumbosacral</b> <b>stenosis,</b> degenerative myelopathy, elbow dysplasia and hip dysplasia. Within the population of the Golden Retriever the following diseases are important: atopic dermatitis, mast cell tumours, melanomas, malignant lymphoma, soft tissue carcinoma, elbow dysplasia and hip dysplasia. The Staffordshire Bull Terrier seems to be a healthy breed. No highly frequent and severe disorders within its population have been found in this study.

40|$|Introduction: Intervertebral disc (IVD) disease {{characterized}} by {{low back pain}} is common in both humans and large breed dogs. Inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) {{play a key role}} in IVD degeneration, causing structural changes of the IVD and low back pain. The current conservative and surgical treatment modalities do not reverse IVD degeneration and have certain drawbacks. Long term systemic administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can cause gastro-intestinal side effects. Decompressive surgery is effective in over 80 % of the patients, but is rather costly and has a long recovery period. Injectable formulations that enable local sustained release of anti-inflammatory drugs aim at decreasing inflammation and thereby inhibiting degeneration and pain. In vitro, controlled release of celecoxib, a COX- 2 inhibitor, from a thermoreversible acetyl-capped PCLA-PEG-PCLA hydrogel inhibited PGE 2 production and enhanced matrix production for 28 days in 3 D culture of canine nucleus pulposus cells that were subjected to the catabolic effects of TNF-α. In vivo, sustained release of celecoxib by the hydrogel for up to 60 days was shown and safely applied intradiscally in laboratory dogs with naturally occurring IVD degeneration. The aim of the present study is to report the safety and feasibility of intradiscal application in client-owned dogs with low back pain related to IVD degeneration. Material and Methods: Client-owned dogs with low back pain were diagnosed by MRI with degenerative <b>lumbosacral</b> <b>stenosis</b> marked by mild to moderate IVD degeneration and protrusion. The dogs were surgical candidates but were offered intradiscal injection. The PCLA-PEG-PCLA thermogel, loaded with 0. 013 mg/ml celecoxib, was percutaneously injected into the nucleus pulposus of L 7 -S 1 under fluoroscopy guidance. Follow-up consisted of clinical examination, owner questionnaires, and objective gait analysis by measurement of ground reaction forces (GRFs) using force plate analysis (FPA) at 6 weeks, and 3 and 6 months after injection. MRI was repeated after 3 months and included T 2 - and T 1 -weighted images and T 2 -mapping. Results: Ten dogs with DLLS were injected with the celecoxib-loaded hydrogel. None of the dogs showed adverse reactions after intradiscal injection. Follow up MRI showed no worsening of the IVD degeneration. Clinical improvement was achieved by reduction of low back pain in 9 / 10 dogs, as was shown by clinical examination, force plate analysis and owner questionnaires. In 3 / 10 dogs low back pain recurred at 3 months and they subsequently underwent standard-of-care surgical treatment. Conclusion: This study showed the safety and feasibility of intradiscal injections with a thermoresponsive hydrogel loaded with celecoxib. Ongoing studies concentrate on the long term clinical follow up of these patients. Future studies will determine the optimal loading dose of celecoxib for clinical efficacy. In this setup, the dog can be used as a model for the development of novel treatment modalities in both canine and human patients with chronic low back pain...|$|E
40|$|Degeneration of the {{intervertebral}} disc (IVD) {{is a common}} problem in dogs and humans. IVD degeneration can lead to herniation of the IVD with subsequent compression of neural structures and various clinical signs, including back pain. Current treatment of IVD disease is conservative or surgical. However, these therapies do not restore health or functionality to the IVD and may lead to spinal instability and recurrence of clinical signs. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} thesis was to investigate the process of IVD degeneration and develop new treatment strategies for dogs with IVD degenerative disease, as well as for humans with IVD degenerative disease using the dog as a research model for translational research purposes. The key findings of the thesis were: Surgical treatments for canine IVD disease that involve partial removal of the IVD result in a significant loss of disc height and spinal stability. Additional stabilization and restoration of IVD functionality are required for optimal treatment of dogs with IVD degenerative diseases. Pedicle screw-rod fixation of the lumbosacral junction can successfully stabilize spinal segments affected by IVD degeneration in middle-sized and large-breed dogs. Although this procedure does not result in interbody fusion of the spinal segment, the surgical outcome is successful and appears to restore the propulsive function of the hind limbs in patients affected by degenerative <b>lumbosacral</b> <b>stenosis.</b> Ways to improve the surgical technique to achieve spinal fusion have been identified. Functional repair of the nuclectomized IVD can be achieved by inserting a nucleus pulposus prosthesis into the nuclear cavity created after nuclectomy. The success of prosthesis insertion can be evaluated by radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. When intact, in situ, and with adequate closure of the annulus fibrosus, the prosthesis significantly restores disc height and spinal stiffness to the nuclectomized spinal segment, and therefore may serve as a valuable future treatment for dogs with IVD disease. IVD degeneration alters the biomechanics of the spine. The spinal biomechanics of chondrodystrophic dogs (with nucleus pulposus rich in chondrocyte-like cells) and non-chondrodystrophic dogs (with nucleus pulposus rich in notochordal cells) are markedly different, probably as a result of differences in the cell population and the extracellular matrix of the nucleus pulposus, and other biomechanical factors. The notochordal cell, the main cell type of the healthy canine nucleus pulposus, exhibits basal canonical Wnt signaling. Early IVD degeneration, which involves the replacement/differentiation of notochordal cells by/into chondrocyte-like cells, is associated with down-regulation of canonical Wnt signaling and with a decreased expression of caveolin- 1, a protein that appears to be fundamental to the preservation of notochordal cells. Early IVD degeneration is accompanied by significant changes in the expression of genes involved in numerous biomolecular signaling pathways, including extracellular matrix remodeling and bone morphogenetic protein signaling. These findings might facilitate the design of strategies for IVD regeneration and help clarify several points debated in the current scientific literature...|$|E
40|$|Degenerative <b>lumbosacral</b> <b>stenosis</b> (DLS) is now {{recognized}} as a significant cause of caudal lumbar pain and pelvic limb lameness in dogs. The condition includes lumbosacral intervertebral disc degeneration and protrusion, spondylosis deformans, sclerosis of the vertebral end plates, osteoarthrosis of articular facets, ventral sacral subluxation, and hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum and joint capsules. The clinical signs are caudal lumbar pain, pelvic limb lameness, reluctance to jump, rise and climb stairs, and neurological signs. Diagnosis of DLS {{is based on the}} history, clinical signs, clinical examination, and imaging findings. The surgical treatment of dogs with DLS aims to relieve the compression on the cauda equina nerve roots. The first aim of this thesis was to determine the diagnostic value of advanced imaging techniques. The findings between computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and surgery were compared There was substantial to almost perfect agreement between the findings on CT and MRI for the degree and location of disc protrusion, the position of the dural sac, the presence of epidural fat, and swelling of nerve roots. There was slight to fair agreement between imaging and surgical findings for the degree and location of disc protrusion, and swelling of nerve roots. CT and MRI provided excellent discrimination of compressive tissues in the spinal canal. The second aim was to investigate the somatosensory function in dogs affected by DLS. Compressive lesions on the cauda equina at L 7 -S 1 in dogs with DLS prolonged the mean latency of tibial nerve somatosensory evoked potentials in dogs with DLS compared with those in clinically normal dogs. The third aim was to objectively evaluate, using force plate analysis (FPA), the result of decompressive surgery in dogs with DLS. In 12 dogs, surgical treatment restored the propulsive forces of the pelvic limbs in a 6 -month period after surgery. The long-term outcome of decompressive surgery in 35 dogs with DLS was assessed by FPA and questionnaires to owners. The propulsive forces of the pelvic limbs, and the ratio between the propulsive forces of the pelvic limbs and the thoracic limbs decreased significantly at 3 days after surgery, and increased during 6 months follow-up, but remained smaller than control values with long-term (? 1. 5 years) follow up. In contrast, the results from the questionnaires showed significant improvement 6 months to 1. 5 years after surgery compared to findings before surgery, and the majority of owners were satisfied. Biomechanical flexion-extension load forces were assessed in cadaveric lumbosacral specimens of healthy middle-sized dogs, before and after dorsal laminectomy with partial discectomy, and after pedicle screw-rod fixation. The flexion and extension load forces after dorsal laminectomy with partial discectomy, were not significantly different from those in the native lumbosacral spine specimen. After pedicle screw-rod fixation, the motions in the instrumented spine segment decreased significantly. Pedicle screw-rod fixation may be used to effectively stabilize the instable L 7 -S 1 junction in dogs with DLS...|$|E

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Degenerative <b>lumbosacral</b> <b>stenosis</b> (DLSS) is a multifactorial condition affecting predominantly large breed dogs. The combination of stenosis and compressive neuropathy cause lumbar pain, lameness and neurologic dysfunction. Previous reports describe urinary and fecal incontinence in severely affected dogs. The objectives of this retrospective case series were to describe the clinical signs associated with dysuria and eventual diagnosis of DLSS in dogs, and to describe factors associated with regained micturition following prompt diagnosis and treatment. Medical records from the University of Georgia and the University of Missouri between 1995 and 2009 of 11 dogs were reviewed. Inclusion required observation of dysuria, urine retention, absence of structural lower urinary tract disease and concurrent presumptive diagnosis of DLSS. Dysuria was defined as inability to initiate or sustain a urine stream. Urine residual volume was evaluated post-voiding. Dysuria was further evaluated using urethral contrast studies, urodynamic testing (urethral profilometry (4) and cystometry (4)), ultrasonography (5), and urine culture (8). Presumptive diagnosis of DLSS was based on imaging using plain radiography and epidurography (8), computed tomography (1) or magnetic resonance imaging (2). Breeds represented included the German Shepherd Dog (n= 3), Golden Retriever (n= 2), Bernese Mountain Dog (n= 2), and 1 each Labrador Retriever, Weimaraner, Rottweiler and mixed-breed. All dogs were male. 8 were intact at onset of clinical signs. Median body weight was 38. 5 kg (range 29. 5 - 46) and median age was 5 years (range 2 - 10). Median duration of clinical signs prior to admission was 2 months (range 0. 25 - 12). Other pertinent presenting clinical signs included dyschezia (2), fecal incontinence (4), general proprioceptive ataxia (2), weakness (2), and difficulty rising (1). Physical examination findings included pelvic limb muscle atrophy (2) and prostatomegaly (1). Abnormal neurologic examination findings included postural reaction deficits (6), hyporeflexia (4), decreased tail tone (3) and lumbosacral hyperesthesia (6). Neurologic examination was normal in 3 dogs. Dorsal laminectomy was performed and diagnosis confirmed in 9 dogs; recovery was monitored for a median of 5. 5 months (range 0. 25 - 9). Three of the 9 dogs (33 %) regained normal micturition within 0. 25 - 1. 5 months of surgery. Though not statistically significant, dogs that regained micturition tended to have a shorter duration of clinical signs (median 0. 25 months, range 0. 25 - 2) versus dogs that remained dysuric (median 5 months, range 2 - 12). Two of the 3 dogs that regained micturition were neutered at the onset of clinical signs, but only 1 of 6 dogs that remained dysuric was neutered. Signs improved in all dogs with postural reaction deficits and decreased tail tone. Hyperesthesia resolved in 5 of 6 dogs (83 %) and fecal continence returned in 2 of 4 dogs (50 %). These findings suggest that following prompt diagnosis and surgical decompression, normal micturition could be regained in DLSS affected dogs presenting with signs of dysuria...|$|E
