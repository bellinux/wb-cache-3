50|$|After works {{had been}} {{completed}} on the raffinate splitter, consideration {{was given to the}} impending start-up of the plant. One of the primary safety critical steps in the prestart-up process was the use of the BP Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) procedure. The purpose of the review was to ensure that complete and thorough technical checks were carried out and that all non-essential personnel were clear during the start-up operation. Once completed, the PSSR would be signed off by refinery operations and safety managers, authorising the start-up work but this essential safety procedure was not completed. In addition, {{there were a number of}} serious issues with items of safety critical equipment which had not been resolved prior to the start-up commencing including an inoperative pressure control valve (PV-5002), a defective high <b>level</b> <b>alarm</b> in the splitter tower (LSH-5102), a defective sight glass used to indicate fluid levels at the base of the splitter tower and the vital splitter tower level transmitter had not been calibrated.|$|E
50|$|The Automatic {{depressurization}} {{system is}} {{not a part of}} the cooling system proper, but is an essential adjunct to the ECCS. It is designed to activate in the event that there is either a loss of high-pressure cooling to the vessel or if the high-pressure cooling systems cannot maintain the RPV water level. ADS can be manually or automatically initiated. When ADS receives an auto-start signal when water reaches the Low-Low-Low Water <b>Level</b> <b>Alarm</b> setpoint. ADS then confirms with the Low Alarm Water Level, verifies at least 1 low-pressure cooling pump is operating, and starts a 105-second timer. When the timer expires, or when the manual ADS initiate buttons are pressed, the system rapidly releases pressure from the RPV in the form of steam through pipes that are piped to below the water level in the suppression pool (the torus/wetwell), which is designed to condense the steam released by ADS or other safety valve activation into water), bringing the reactor vessel below 32 atm (3200 kPa, 465 psi), allowing the low-pressure cooling systems (LPCS/LPCI/LPCF/GDCS) to restore reactor water level. During an ADS blowdown, the steam being removed from the reactor is sufficient to ensure adequate core cooling even if the core is uncovered. The water in the reactor will rapidly flash to steam as reactor pressure drops, carrying away the latent heat of vaporization and providing cooling for the entire reactor. Low pressure ECCS systems will re-flood the core prior to the end of the emergency blowdown, ensuring that the core retains adequate cooling during the entire event.|$|E
5000|$|Investigating this {{pressure}} spike, the Day Board Operator fully opened the level control valve {{to the heavy}} raffinate storage tank and shut off of the gas fueling the furnace, but the raffinate feed into the splitter tower was not shut off. Hot raffinate flowed into the blowdown drum and stack and as it filled, some of the fluid started to flow into the ISOM unit sewer system via a 6 in pipeline {{at the base of}} the blowdown drum, but the high <b>level</b> <b>alarm</b> for the blowdown drum didn't sound. As the blowdown drum and stack filled up, hot raffinate shot out of the top of the stack and into the air, forming a 20 ft [...] "geyser". The hot raffinate rained down on the ground and ran down the side of the blow-down drum and stack and pooled {{at the base of the}} unit. A radio call was received in the control room that hot hydrocarbons were overflowing from the stack. A pick-up truck, with its engine running, had been carelessly parked within 30 ft of the blowdown stack; the vapor cloud reached the vehicle, and hydrocarbon fumes were drawn directly into the air intake valve, causing the engine to race. Nearby workers frantically tried to shut down the engine, without success. The expanding vapor cloud forced the workers who were trying to shut down the overspeeding truck engine to retreat. The cloud continued to spread across the ISOM plant, across the pipe-rack to the West and into the trailer area unimpeded. No emergency alarm sounded, and at approximately 1:20 p.m., the vapor cloud was ignited by a backfire seen from the overheating truck engine by nearby witnesses, producing a massive explosion that was heard for miles. The blast pressure wave struck the contractor trailers, either completely destroying or severely damaging many of them. The force of the explosion sent debris flying, instantly killing 15 people in and around the trailers and severely injuring 180 others. The pressure wave was so powerful it blew out windows off site up to a distance of 3/4 mi away. An area estimated at 200000 sq ft of the refinery was badly burned by the subsequent fire that followed the violent explosion, damaging millions of dollars worth of refinery equipment. The entire ISOM unit was severely damaged by the explosion and subsequent fire, and as a result, remained out of operation for more than 2 years.|$|E

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} is to design and {{implement}} a system that detect driver sleepiness and warn driver in real-time using image processing and machine learning techniques. Material and Method: Viola-Jones detector was used for segmenting face and eye images from the camera-acquired driver video. Left and right eye images were combined into a single image. Thus, an image was obtained in minimum dimensions containing both eyes. Features of these images were extracted by using Gabor filters. These features were used to classifying images for open and closed eyes. Five machine learning algorithms were evaluated with four volunteer’s eye image data set obtained from driving simulator. Nearest neighbor IBk algorithm has highest accuracy by 94. 76 % while J 48 decision tree algorithm has fastest classification speed with 91. 98 % accuracy. J 48 decision tree algorithm was recommended for real time running. PERCLOS the ratio of number of closed eyes in one minute period and CLOSDUR the duration of closed eyes were calculated. The driver is warned with the first <b>level</b> <b>alarm</b> when the PERCLOS value is 0. 15 or above, and with second <b>level</b> <b>alarm</b> when it is 0. 3 or above. In addition, when it is detected that the eyes remain closed for two seconds, the driver is also warned by the second <b>level</b> <b>alarm</b> regardless of the PERCLOS value.

40|$|The {{problem with}} high water <b>level</b> <b>alarm</b> {{that led to}} power {{shutdown}} did first occurred on the 3 rd of May 2008 at Ringhals 1. In the beginning there was a theory that boiling triggered the measurement system that consists of a floating switch, {{it has not been}} verified if the alarm was triggered by steam or liquid. During the investigation process data was collected from Vattenfalls’ information systems and a RELAP 5 model of the drainage system. This model was built with the purpose of simulating different scenario and to gather data that Vattenfall was lacking. It was first stated from Vattenfall that power shutdown was avoided on the 9 th of May due to opening a valve more gradually. Analyzes comparing the cases 3 rd of May and 9 th of May show that the conditions was not equal enough to make the conclusion. Model simulations show that both super heaters take half of the mass flow (assuming negligible differences) from the high pressure turbine under all circumstances, therefore the crossflow pipe takes the other half in cases on the 3 rd and 9 th of May 2008. A theory that one of the super heaters at 3 rd of May was overloaded is not the case according to the model. Liquid that was accumulated and dumped from pipe systems and then triggered the high <b>level</b> <b>alarm</b> was investigated. Results show that the pipe system after the drainage tank can acquire enough water if it is assumed that the water is pushed up into the tank from a back flow.

Although the 0. 4 standard is widely accepted, the derivation of the value lacks rigid theoretical foundations.

In this paper, we incorporate Rawls' principle of fair equality of opportunity into Arrow-Debreu's framework of general equilibrium theory with heterogeneous agents, and derive the <b>alarming</b> <b>level</b> of Gini coefficient formally. Our theory reveals that the exponential distribution of income not only satisfies Pareto optimality, but also obeys social fairness in Rawls' sense.

It includes the ability of the navigation system to provide timely warnings to users when the system fails to meet its stated accuracy. Specifically, a navigation system is required to deliver a warning (alarm) when the error in the derived user position solution exceeds an allowable <b>level</b> (<b>alarm</b> limit). This warning must be issued to the user within a given period of time (time-to-alarm) and with a given probability (integrity risk). The two main approaches to monitoring the integrity of satellite navigation systems are Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM), and monitoring based on an independent network of integrity monitoring stations and a dedicated Ground Integrity Channel (GIC). More recently Satellite Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (SAIM) methods have also been investigated. This paper presents the results of a study to assess the RAIM capability of the Galileo system when used alone and when combined with the Global Positioning System (GPS).
