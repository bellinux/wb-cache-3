6000|$|... "Now down again, Mr. Noel," [...] she said. [...] "Gently down again, in {{this fine}} sunlight. I {{have much to}} say to you, sir, which you never {{expected}} to hear from me. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> little domestic question first. They told me at the house door Mrs. Noel Vanstone was gone away on a journey. Has she gone for long?" ...|$|E
60|$|Cel. I was in {{hope your}} majesty had forgot me; therefore, if you please, madam, I'll only beg a pardon for having taken up arms once to-day against you; for I have a foolish kind of conscience, which I wish {{many of your}} {{subjects}} had, that will not <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> recompence for my loyalty, when I know I have been a rebel.|$|E
5000|$|Mr. Plowman the State: Now, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>a</b> question, ma'am. Do {{you have}} any {{religious}} beliefs or personal beliefs against the death penalty? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{when you}} come down to-morrow night, don't call out! <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>a</b> parting question. What made you cry, 'Halloa! Below there!' to-night?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is beyond}} all measure charming of you," [...] Guillot declared, [...] "but <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>a</b> little question. Is it peace or war?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't know, pray let me go!" [...] she said, {{her bosom}} {{beginning}} to rise. [...] "I am afraid what to do! I {{want to be}} just to you, and to be {{that seems to be}} wronging myself, and perhaps it is breaking the commandments. There is considerable doubt of his death, and then it is dreadful; <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> solicitor, Mr. Boldwood, if I ought or no!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I wouldn't ask you, Mr Noggs,' said Mrs Kenwigs, 'if I didn't {{know what}} a good, kind-hearted {{creature}} you are; no, not for worlds. I am a weak constitution, Mr Noggs, but my spirit would no more <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> favour where I {{thought there was a}} chance of its being refused, than it would let me submit to see my children trampled down and trod upon, by envy and lowness!' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{conversation}} {{was taking a}} direction which frightened Mr. Tom. In the next moment she might be asking advice about {{the choice of a}} husband. It was plain enough that love {{had nothing to do with}} the matter, and Mr. Tom did not wish to act the part of a practical-minded Cupid. [...] "And now <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> favor of you," [...] said he. [...] "Won't you give me time to think over this matter a little?" ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>a</b> question...: {{the first}} time you fucked her, was she any good? Yeah? Now <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you another question: how do you think she got that way? ...|$|R
3000|$|Jimmie:—I’m talkin’. Now <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>a</b> question, Jules. When {{you drove}} in here, {{did you notice}} a sign out front that said, ‘Dead nigger storage?’ [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sorry I look so--I {{try to hide}} it. But {{of course}} we're very simple. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> then <b>a</b> simple earnest childlike question. Are her parents also in society?" ...|$|R
6000|$|And now, in turn, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> few questions. If, by any or {{all these}} matters, {{the repeal of the}} Missouri Compromise was commanded, why was not the command sooner obeyed? Why was the repeal omitted in the Nebraska Bill of 1853? Why was it omitted in the {{original}} bill of 1854? Why in the accompanying report was such a repeal characterized as a departure from the course pursued in 1850 and its continued omission recommended? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will find}} it little enough--in London among strangers. We need not speak any more about it, and you owe me no thanks. It is only right {{that you should have}} one quarter's money of the four I have received." [...] After an {{interval}} of silence, and when her daughter was about to leave the room, she continued, [...] "Before you go, Constance, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> favour of you. If you are going away soon this will be our last conversation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If we {{have any}} chance of tracing {{the person who has}} written this," [...] I said, {{returning}} the letter to Miss Halcombe, [...] "there can be no harm in seizing our opportunity the moment it offers. I think we ought to speak to the gardener again about the elderly woman who gave him the letter, and then to continue our inquiries in the village. But first <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> question. You mentioned just now the alternative of consulting Mr. Fairlie's legal adviser to-morrow. Is there no possibility of communicating with him earlier? Why not to-day?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Glad to see {{you both}} so ruddy; Cobhurst air must agree with you. And now, before we say {{anything}} else, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>a</b> question: Have you had your supper?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A great {{fellow in}} livery opens the door, and says, 'You're the forty- fifth as come about this 'ere place; but, fust, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>a</b> {{preliminary}} question. Are you a Hirishwoman?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} gone," [...] Saton answered, [...] "before {{any of your}} guests are up. In case I do not see you again alone, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>a</b> question, or rather a favor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, my dear fellow. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> {{question}} in turn. You imply that I {{have always known}} these things about my unfortunate kinsmen. So I have. Do you suppose that Attwood hasn't always known them? Do you suppose he hasn't always known you as an honest man who would say these things {{when he got a}} chance? Why does Attwood unmuzzle you like a dog at this moment, after all these years? I know why he does; I know a good many things, far too many things. And therefore, as I have the honor to remark, I am proud of my family at last." ...|$|E
6000|$|He could {{command the}} music-room very well {{from where he}} stood, behind a thick outer fringe of intently {{listening}} men. Verena Tarrant was erect on her little platform, dressed in white, with flowers in her bosom. The red cloth beneath her feet looked rich {{in the light of}} lamps placed on high pedestals {{on either side of the}} stage; it gave her figure a setting of colour which made it more pure and salient. She moved freely in her exposed isolation, yet with great sobriety of gesture; there was no table in front of her, and she had no notes in her hand, but stood there like an actress before the footlights, or a singer spinning vocal sounds to a silver thread. There was such a risk that a slim provincial girl, pretending to fascinate a couple of hundred blasé New Yorkers by simply giving them her ideas, would fail of her effect, that at the end of a few moments Basil Ransom became aware that he was watching her in very much the same excited way as if she had been performing, high above his head, on the trapeze. Yet, as one listened, it was impossible not to perceive that she was in perfect possession of her faculties, her subject, her audience; and he remembered the other time at Miss Birdseye's well enough to be able to measure the ground she had travelled since then. This exhibition was much more complete, her manner much more assured; she seemed to speak and survey the whole place from a much greater height. Her voice, too, had developed; he had forgotten how beautiful it could be when she raised it to its full capacity. Such a tone as that, so pure and rich, and yet so young, so natural, constituted in itself a talent; he didn't wonder that they had made a fuss about her at the Female Convention, if she filled their hideous hall with such a music. He had read, of old, of the improvisatrice of Italy, and this was a chastened, modern, American version of the type, a New England Corinna, with a mission instead of a lyre. The most graceful part of her was her earnestness, the way her delightful eyes, wandering over the [...] "fashionable audience" [...] (before which she was so perfectly unabashed), as if she wished to resolve it into a single sentient personality, seemed to say that the only thing in life she cared for was to put the truth into a form that would render conviction irresistible. She was as simple as she was charming, and there was not a glance or motion that did not seem part of the pure, still-burning passion that animated her. She had indeed--it was manifest--reduced the company to unanimity; their attention was anything but languid; they smiled back at her when she smiled; they were noiseless, motionless when she was solemn; and it was evident that the entertainment which Mrs. Burrage had had the happy thought of offering to her friends would be memorable in the annals of the Wednesday Club. It was agreeable to Basil Ransom to think that Verena noticed him in his corner; her eyes played over her listeners so freely that you couldn't say they rested in one place more than another; nevertheless, a single rapid ray, which, however, didn't in the least strike him as a deviation from her ridiculous, fantastic, delightful argument, let him now that he had been missed and now was particularly spoken to. This glance was a sufficient assurance that his invitation had come to him by the girl's request. He took for granted the matter of her speech was ridiculous; how could it help being, and what did it signify if it was? She was none the less charming for that, and the moonshine she had been plied with was none the less moonshine for her being charming. After he had stood there a quarter of an hour he became conscious that he should not be able to repeat a word she had said; he had not definitely heeded it, and yet he had not lost a vibration of her voice. He had discovered Olive Chancellor by this time; she was in the front row of chairs, at the end, on the left; her back was turned to him, but he could see half her sharp profile, bent down a little and absolutely motionless. Even across the wide interval her attitude expressed to him a kind of rapturous stillness, the concentration of triumph. There were several irrepressible effusions of applause, instantly self-checked, but Olive never looked up, at the loudest, and such a calmness as that could only be the result of passionate volition. Success was in the air, and she was tasting it; she tasted it, as she did everything, in a way of her own. Success for Verena was success for her, and Ransom was sure that the only thing wanting to her triumph was that he should have been placed in the line of her vision, so that she might enjoy his embarrassment and confusion, might say to him, in one of her dumb, cold flashes--"Now do you think our movement is not a force--now do you think that women are meant to be slaves?" [...] Honestly, he was not conscious of any confusion; it subverted none of his heresies to perceive that Verena Tarrant had even more power to fix his attention than he had hitherto supposed. It was fixed in a way it had not been yet, however, by his at last understanding her speech, feeling it reach his inner sense through the impediment of mere dazzled vision. Certain phrases took on a meaning for him--an appeal she was making to those who still resisted the beneficent influence of the truth. They appeared to be mocking, cynical men, mainly; many of whom were such triflers and idlers, so heartless and brainless that it didn't matter much what they thought on any subject; if the old tyranny needed to be propped up by them it showed it was in a pretty bad way. But there were others whose prejudice was stronger and more cultivated, pretended to rest upon study and argument. To those she wished particularly to address herself; she wanted to waylay them, to say, [...] "Look here, you're all wrong; you'll be so much happier when I have convinced you. Just give me five minutes," [...] she should like to say; [...] "just sit down here and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> <b>a</b> simple question. Do you think any state of society can come to good that is based upon an organised wrong?" [...] That was the simple question that Verena desired to propound, and Basil smiled across the room at her with an amused tenderness as he gathered that she conceived it to be a poser. He didn't think it would frighten him much if she were to ask him that, and he would sit down with her for as many minutes as she liked.|$|E

6000|$|... 'If they did! They will. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>a</b> question. I know {{something}} more than your name about you; I knew something about Gaffer Hexam. When did you last set eyes upon his daughter?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, Dick, old chap," [...] he said, [...] "you {{are just}} back from abroad {{and you are not}} quite in the hang of things yet. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>a</b> plain question. What do you think of us all?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am {{delighted to}} hear that our friends have arrived at last,' he said. 'Before I shake hands with them, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>a</b> {{question}} about this queer work of art here. I see photographs of it downstairs. Are they for sale?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I neither {{want any}} thanks, nor merit any," [...] was the {{careless}} rejoinder. [...] "It {{was nothing to}} do, in the first place; and I don't know why I did it, in the second. Mr. Darnay, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>a</b> question." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "My dear young man," [...] the {{professor}} said earnestly, [...] "let {{me point out}} to {{you that this is}} a wonderful position in which you have been placed. You ought to be most proud and grateful. Any trifling inconveniences which may result should be, I venture to say, utterly ignored by you. Now come, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>a</b> question. Are you feeling absolutely your--how shall I call it--revised self to-day?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My friend, the {{question}} you ask cannot be fully answered," [...] said Egede. [...] "I can explain, however, that our first parents were put into {{the world to be}} tried or tested in that way. To have warned Eve would have rendered the test useless. Enough for us to know that she was told what to do. Her duty was to obey. But <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>a</b> question: is not sin--is not murder--hateful?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{begin to}} think I have. But, Mrs. Orme, will you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>a</b> favour? Perhaps you will not say {{anything}} about my coming here.

Of course she gave the required promise; and, looking {{to the character of}} the woman, we may say that, of course, she kept it.|$|R

If you come with any information exculpating them, and showing they are not spies or hostile to the cause, your father's release shall be certain and speedy. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>a</b> single question: Why do you believe them honest?" ...|$|R
