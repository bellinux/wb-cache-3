This research extends the calculation of conventional reliability indices to include customer damage {{in the form of}} increased monetary costs due to power supply failures.

The VBRA process involves having component reliability data, the ability to calculate suitable <b>load</b> <b>point</b> reliability indices and applicable customer damage costs.

50|$|The {{distinction}} between rowing {{and other forms}} of water transport, such as canoeing or kayaking, is that in rowing the oars are held in place at a pivot point that is in a fixed position relative to the boat, this point is the <b>load</b> <b>point</b> for the oar to act as a second class lever (the blade fixed in the water is the fulcrum). In flatwater rowing, the boat (also called a shell or fine boat) is narrow to avoid drag, and the oars are attached to oarlocks at the end of outriggers extending from the sides of the boat. Racing boats also have sliding seats to allow the use of the legs in addition to the body to apply power to the oar. Racing shells are inherently unstable, much like racing kayaks or canoes. The rowing boats require oars on both sides to prevent them from rolling over.|$|E
