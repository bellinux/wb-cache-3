25|$|The November 2009 <b>launch</b> <b>window</b> of Atlantis, between November 16 and November 20, was {{complicated}} by {{the launch of the}} Mini-Russian Research Module 2 (MRM-2) aboard a Soyuz-U rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Further conflict was caused by Eastern Range constraints with two other satellite launches from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, one {{at the beginning of the}} shuttle's <b>launch</b> <b>window</b> and the other at the end. The Eastern Range had been reserved on November 14 and 15, 2009, for the launch of the communications satellite Intelsat 14 aboard an Atlas-V rocket. A Delta-IV rocket carrying a Wideband Global SATCOM satellite was also expected to lift off on November 19, 2009.|$|E
25|$|Phoenix was {{launched}} on August 4, 2007, at 5:26:34a.m. EDT (09:26:34 UTC) on a Delta 7925 launch vehicle from Pad 17-A of the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The launch was nominal with no significant anomalies. The Phoenix lander {{was placed on}} a trajectory of such precision that its first trajectory course correction burn, performed on August 10, 2007 at 7:30a.m. EDT (11:30 UTC), was only 18m/s. The launch took place during a <b>launch</b> <b>window</b> extending from August 3, 2007 to August 24, 2007. Due to the small <b>launch</b> <b>window</b> the rescheduled launch of the Dawn mission (originally planned for July 7) had to stand down and {{was launched}} after Phoenix in September. The Delta 7925 was chosen due to its successful launch history, which includes launches of the Spirit and Opportunity Mars Exploration Rovers in 2003 and Mars Pathfinder in 1996.|$|E
25|$|The Wii U was {{launched}} with 23 games in North America, 26 games in Europe, 25 games in Australia, and 11 games in Japan.

25|$|The Mars Orbiter Mission probe lifted-off {{from the}} First Launch Pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre (Sriharikota Range SHAR), Andhra Pradesh, using a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) rocket C25 at 09:08UTC on 5 November 2013. The <b>launch</b> <b>window</b> was {{approximately}} 20 days long and started on 28 October 2013. The MOM probe spent {{about a month}} in Earth orbit, where it {{made a series of}} seven apogee-raising orbital manoeuvres before trans-Mars injection on 30 November 2013 (UTC).

5000|$|The energy {{needed for}} {{transfer}} between planetary orbits, or [...] "∆V", is lowest at intervals fixed by the synodic period. For Earth / Mars trips, this is every 26 months (2 years and 2 months), so missions are typically planned {{to coincide with}} one of these <b>launch</b> <b>windows.</b> The energy needed in the low-energy windows varies on roughly a 15-year cycle with the easiest windows needing only half the energy of the peaks. In the 20th century, there was a minimum in the 1969 and 1971 <b>launch</b> <b>windows</b> and another low in 1986 and 1988, then the cycle repeated.|$|R

25|$|The {{launch of}} Dawn was rescheduled for September 26, 2007, then September 27, due to bad weather delaying fueling {{of the second}} stage, the same problem that delayed the July 7 launch attempt. The <b>launch</b> <b>window</b> {{extended}} from 07:20–07:49 EDT (11:20–11:49 GMT). During the final built-in hold at T4 minutes, a ship entered the exclusion area offshore, the strip of ocean where the rocket boosters were likely to fall after separation. After commanding the ship to leave the area, the launch was required {{to wait for the}} end of a collision avoidance window with the International Space Station. Dawn finally launched from pad 17-B at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on a Delta 7925-H rocket at 07:34 EDT, reaching escape velocity {{with the help of a}} spin-stabilized solid-fueled third stage. Thereafter, Dawn's ion thrusters took over.|$|E
25|$|The first launch {{attempt was}} delayed by 24 hours due to weather concerns, {{including}} multiple weather violations in NASA's launch rules beginning over 2 {{hours before the}} scheduled launch. During the second attempt on Wednesday morning, {{a problem with a}} LH2 fill-and-drain fuel valve inside Discoverys aft compartment led to another scrubbing. The problem arose when sensors did not detect the closure of the valve when commanded to do so. The issue was thought to be with the sensors rather than the valve itself. After inerting the orbiter's tank, which involved draining it, tests were conducted on the valves. Despite the valves working normally, another delay was called for to have more confidence in the system, and to give the console operators who performed the test some rest. The launch team evaluated the issue, passing on a possible <b>launch</b> <b>window</b> on 27 August 2009 at 01:10 EDT. The launch was delayed until 23:59 EDT, 28 August 2009, to allow the engineers to be fully satisfied with the vehicle. Later the mission was cleared for launch which involved a flight rule waiver for cycling the valve and a discussion to analyze the test failure of an Ares-1 booster that was similar to the SRBs used for the mission. NASA feared another delay when storms formed near the Kennedy Space Center on 28 August 2009, but the weather cleared in time for a successful launch of Discovery at 23:59 EDT.|$|E
500|$|Following {{a poll of}} {{the mission}} {{management}} team at 7:12am EST in which all stations (with {{the exception of the}} Shuttle Range Officer) returned a [...] "go for launch" [...] and the eventual clearance of the range for launch at 7:20am EST, Atlantis raced into the sky {{at the beginning of a}} 10-minute, 9-second <b>launch</b> <b>window</b> following a flawless countdown with no unscheduled holds. The shuttle lifted off the pad at 7:30:43am EST; the main engines were shut down at 7:39am EST.|$|E

At retail, Windows 10 is priced similarly to editions of Windows 8.1, with U.S. prices set at $119 and $199 for Windows 10Home and Pro respectively. A Windows 10 Pro Pack license allows upgrades from Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Pro. Retail copies ship on USB flash drive media or DVD-ROM media.

500|$|Capcom's pre-release sales {{projection}} for the game's <b>launch</b> <b>window,</b> {{through the}} end of March 2017, was 4 million copies. The game had shipped over 2.5 million units worldwide days after the release, while the demo exceeded 7.15 million downloads. The modest shipment figure had an effect on Capcom's stock price, which fell more than three percent following the Tokyo Stock Exchange. It was the best-selling video game in the UK during its week of release according to Chart-Track, amounting to the third-best debut in Resident Evil history behind 5 (7.1 mill) and 6 (6.6 mill). 200,000 copies had also been sold through Steam during that time. It ranked first in the Japanese charts for the week ending January 29; the PS4 sales totalled 187,306 copies, 58.9 percent of its initial shipment. In the month of January in the United States, Resident Evil 7 sold the most out of any video game. On February 1, Capcom communicated to its investors that the game had recouped its budget. It remained {{at the top of the}} UK sales chart in its second week. [...] February saw Resident Evil 7 ranked the second best-selling video game in the United States, behind For Honor. By April 2017, Resident Evil 7 had sold 3.5 million copies worldwide, short of Capcom's expectation of 4 million. In May 2017, Capcom gave the game a lifetime sales forecast of 10 million units, citing favorable reviews, marketing and downloadable content as contributing factors. From July to November, it went from 3.7 million to 4 million copies.|$|E
