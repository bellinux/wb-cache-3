5|$|After Team Plasma's defeat, <b>Looker</b> {{arrives in}} Unova and tasks the player with finding the {{remaining}} Sages of Team Plasma, {{so they can}} be brought to justice. The player can also challenge the Elite Four once again, and challenge Alder, ultimately becoming the Unova region's new Pokémon Champion. The player also gains access to the eastern portion of Unova, which contains Pokémon from the previous games in the series, as well as access to an area unique to each game version: the ultra-metropolitan Black City, home to powerful Pokémon trainers; and the White Forest, home to humans and Pokémon living in harmony. Cynthia, a former Champion of the Sinnoh region, is also found in this area of the game and can be challenged. A non-player character named after Shigeki Morimoto, a Game Freak programmer, creature designer, {{and the director of the}} HeartGold and SoulSilver games, can also be found and battled in the game.|$|E

25|$|St. Louis {{took the}} ball back and drove 57 yards in 15 plays, {{featuring}} a 22-yard reception by Marshall Faulk on fourth down and two, and scored with Faulk's 1-yard touchdown run. Bulger's subsequent 2-point conversion pass to <b>Looker</b> cut the score to 23–20 with 2:39 to go. Then Wilkins recovered his own onside kick, setting up a 43-yard drive that ended with his 33-yard field goal. The field goal would cause some controversy, as the Rams held the ball inside the Carolina 20-yard line {{with less than a}} minute remaining, and one timeout. But Rams coach Mike Martz elected to play for the tie, allowing the clock to run down and kick the tying field goal, rather than let his quick-scoring offense try for the winning touchdown. Wilkins sent the game into overtime when he booted his fifth field goal of the afternoon through the uprights to tie the score at 23 as time expired in regulation.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the present study was to {{investigate}} age and individual differences in visual attention and oral exploration in 6 - and 11 -month old infants. An infant-controlled habituation procedure with an object examination task was used to assess visual attention and oral exploration. This task yields the visual components of casual looking (a passive form of attention) and examining (an active form of visual information processing), and a measure of oral exploration, active mouthing. In addition, use of the object examination task allowed infants to be categorized as long or short <b>lookers</b> based on a median split of their peak examining times on the habituation trials. Performance on the object examination task was then compared to performance on the Fagan Test of Recognition Memory. Results revealed that long <b>lookers</b> scored lower than short <b>lookers</b> on the Fagan test, indicating that the individual differences in examining may influence performance on other visual attention tasks. In addition: (1) long <b>lookers</b> took longer to habituate than short <b>lookers,</b> (2) 6 -month-olds engaged in more casual looking but less examining than 11 -month-olds during habituation, (3) long <b>lookers</b> spent more time in casual looking and examining than did short <b>lookers</b> during habituation, (4) 6 -month-olds engaged in significantly more active mouthing followed by examining than 11 -month-olds. Therefore, younger infants do not appear to engage in as much active visual processing as older infants, but may use oral behaviour as a means of exploration. Furthermore, short <b>lookers</b> did not engage in as much examining as long <b>lookers,</b> which may be a reflection of their more efficient visual processing ability. These findings are important as they indicate that measures of active information processing such as examining and active mouthing should be considered when assessing the developing cognitive capabilities of young infants...|$|R
25|$|St. Louis {{scored on}} their first drive of the game, with Marc Bulger {{completing}} passes to Dane <b>Looker</b> and Isaac Bruce for gains of 24 and 17 yards {{on the way to}} a 20-yard Jeff Wilkins field goal. They went on to add another field goal {{on their first}} drive of the second quarter, set up by Tommy Polley's 37-yard interception return to the Panthers 22-yard line. On the first play after the ensuing kickoff, Carolina managed to take the momentum with a 65-yard run by Stephen Davis, giving them a first down on the Rams 4. Eventually faced with third and goal from the 5, quarterback Jake Delhomme was tackled behind the line and fumbled the ball while attempting a shovel pass, but it rolled into the end zone where receiver Muhsin Muhammad recovered it for a touchdown that gave the Panthers a 7-6 lead. The Rams got the ball back on their own 46 due to a 15-yard face mask penalty by Mike Minter while tackling Arlen Harris at the end of a 30-yard return, and retook the lead with a third field goal from Wilkins. However, the Panthers also received good field position to start their next series, as Brad Hoover returned the next kickoff 19 yards to the Carolina 41. Delhomme then led the Panthers to the St. Louis 27 where John Kasay kicked a 45-yard field goal, giving the team a 10-9 lead at the end of the half.|$|E

2500|$|Recent {{research}} on the early precursors of theory of mind has looked at innovative ways at capturing preverbal infants' understanding of other people's mental states, including perception and beliefs. Using a variety of experimental procedures, {{studies have shown that}} infants in their second year of life have an implicit understanding of what other people see and what they know. A popular paradigm used to study infants' theory of mind is the violation of expectation procedure, which predicates on infants' tendency to look longer at unexpected and surprising events compared to familiar and expected events. Therefore, their looking-times measures would give researchers an indication of what infants might be inferring, or their implicit understanding of events. One recent study using this paradigm found that 16-month-olds tend to attribute beliefs to a person whose visual perception was previously witnessed as being [...] "reliable", compared to someone whose visual perception was [...] "unreliable". Specifically, 16-month-olds were trained to expect a person's excited vocalization and gaze into a container to be associated with finding a toy in the reliable-looker condition or an absence of a toy in the unreliable-looker condition. Following this training phase, infants witnessed, in an object-search task, the same persons either searching for a toy in the correct or incorrect location after they both witnessed the location of where the toy was hidden. Infants who experienced the reliable <b>looker</b> were surprised and therefore looked longer when the person searched for the toy in the incorrect location compared to the correct location. In contrast, the looking time for infants who experienced the unreliable <b>looker</b> did not differ for either search locations. These findings suggest that 16-month-old infants can differentially attribute beliefs about a toy's location based on the person's prior record of visual perception.|$|E

2500|$|Simon Baron-Cohen {{identified}} the infant's understanding {{of attention in}} others, a social skill found by 7 to 9 months of age, as a [...] "critical precursor" [...] {{to the development of}} theory of mind. Understanding attention involves understanding that seeing can be directed selectively as attention, that the <b>looker</b> assesses the seen object as [...] "of interest", and that seeing can induce beliefs. Attention can be directed and shared by the act of pointing, a joint attention behavior that requires taking into account another person's mental state, particularly whether the person notices an object or finds it of interest. [...] Baron-Cohen speculates that the inclination to spontaneously reference an object in the world as of interest ("protodeclarative pointing") and to likewise appreciate the directed attention and interests of another may be the underlying motive behind all human communication.|$|E
