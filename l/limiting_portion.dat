This research brief investigates the impact of eating lowenergy-dense foods on calories consumed, satiety, and body weight. Achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight can be challenging. A person must sustain a careful balance between calories consumed and energy expended {{in order to maintain}} his or her recommended body weight and must consume fewer calories than expended in order to lose weight.

Many individuals attempting to lose weight join formal programs, especially women, but these programs vary widely in focus, as do postprogram weight regain results. We surveyed 2, 106 former participants in a community-based, insurance-sponsored weight management program in the United States to identify the pre, during, and post-intervention behavioral and psychosocial factors that lead to successful WLM.

Logistic regression analyses suggest that interventionists should assess and discuss weight loss and behavior change perceptions early in a program.

40|$|Polyadenylic acid (poly A) was studied {{under various}} {{conditions}} using both DC polarography and phase sensitive AC polarography and by measuring the time-course of the current during the lifetime of a single drop of the dropping mercury electrode. Under certain conditions the current at potentials of the <b>limiting</b> <b>portion</b> of the DC polarographic wave does not reach its limiting value and in extreme situations peak-shaped curves are observed. This phenomenon is {{explained in terms of}} desorption and repulsion from the electrode of neutral poly A due to its polyanionic character. Consequently, the suppression of the current can be enhanced by increasing negative potential of the electrode and by exposing the negative charges of phosphate groups, e. g., by increasing pH and temperature and by decreasing ionic strength and buffer capacity; vice versa, the current suppression can be at least partially eliminated by reversing these conditions. Polyamines which seem to shield the phosphate groups through specific interactions are very effective in eliminating the current suppression. The effectiveness of a polyamine is determined by its chain length and by the density of its amino groups and the geometry of their distribution...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background: The study {{tried to}} {{identify}} coping strategies adopted by urban slum dwellers {{to prevent the}} situation of food insecurity. Methods: A household-based cross-sectional study on a sample of 446 households was conducted. Structured interview schedule was used {{to collect data on}} coping strategies along with group discussions. Standard univariate analysis was done using SPSS (version- 16). Results: Unique coping strategies were found to be adopted by households. Strategies included relying on less expensive foods like seasonal or locally available vegetables, <b>limiting</b> <b>portion</b> size of meals and reducing numbers of meals eaten in a day. To increase short-term availability of food, households borrowed food or lend money from friends or relatives, bought food on credit from private grocery shops, used reserves, and relied on food aid. Households ate at religious places in an attempt to increase access to food, withdrew children from school to save money on the school fees and also sent children to work. In case of extreme insecurity, migration was observed. Conclusions: Coping strategies used by the households can be seen as an expression of negotiated decisions to minimize the impact of food insecurity in the households. Hence, understanding these food insecurity coping strategies could be a good starting point to develo...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the diet diversity, food access and coping strategies applied by single mothers with young children in the Northern Okavango region of Botswana. A qualitative and quantitative survey was chosen as the research design for this study. The study site was Gumare village in rural Ngamiland and the sample included only single female headed households. The questionnaires used were contextualized to reflect the culture, food patterns and specific foods commonly consumed in Botswana. Three questionnaires were used: 1. A socio- demographic questionnaire to document household size, age, marital status, income and water sources and the indigenous and wild foods that were gathered 2. The international standardized Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS) questionnaire to identify the variety of foods from fourteen food groups consumed by households over the previous 24 hours 3. The international standardized Coping Strategies Index (CSI) to determine the coping strategy behaviours of members of the household when faced with food shortages The socio demographic results of the study showed that female headed households had an average 7. 4 members. They were seriously affected by poverty, as 58 % of the households had registered under the Botswana Social Welfare programme as destitute. Therefore qualifies to be assisted through provision of food baskets and cash vouchers. The overall results obtained from the household dietary diversity questionnaire showed a diet diversity score of 2. 0. This is an extremely low diet diversity value, which indicate a high level of vulnerability to food insecurity and inadequate food access. The foods which were mainly consumed by households were from the cereal food group, reflecting the global situation among the poor who rely on starch- based diets. The intake from dairy products (10 %), meats (28 %) and Vitamin A rich vegetables (16 %) was limited. Given the limited food variety resulting in severe restriction to food access, coping strategies to address food shortages were employed. These included; relying on less preferred and less expensive food (100 %), gathering wild food, hunting or harvesting immature crops (68 %), <b>limiting</b> <b>portion</b> sizes (96 %), reducing the number of meals eaten in the day (76 %), depending on government food baskets (58 %) and reducing overall food intake when the government food basket was not adequate (50 %). It can be concluded that, given the restricted food access and a severely limited diversity in consumed food, extended government welfare assistance is crucial. The findings of this study could be used to guide the Botswana government when formulating new approaches and interventions to address food access and ultimately food security in households in this poverty- stricken area.
