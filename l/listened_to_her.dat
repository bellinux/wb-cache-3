5|$|Until about 1571/1572 Dudley {{supported}} Mary Stuart's succession {{rights to}} the English throne. He was also, from the early 1560s, on the best terms with the Protestant lords in Scotland, thereby supporting the English or, as he saw it, the Protestant interest. After Mary Stuart's flight into England (1568) Leicester was, unlike Cecil, in favour of restoring her as Scottish queen under English control, preferably with a Protestant English husband, such as the Duke of Norfolk. In 1577 Leicester had a personal meeting with Mary and <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> complaints about her captivity. By the early 1580s Mary had come to fear Leicester's influence with James VI, her son, in whose privy chamber the English Earl had placed a spy. She spread stories about his supposed lust for the English throne, and when the Catholic anti-Leicester libel, Leicester's Commonwealth, was published in 1584 Dudley believed that Mary was involved in its conception.|$|E
25|$|Songs {{and music}} were a natural {{extension}} of this interest in words and {{her love of}} music began early in life as she <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> father, Walter Pendleton Stringfellow, sing. She had access to a scrapbook of folk songs collected by her grandmother, Rosalie Cope Stringfellow. She began her music career collecting folksongs and performing them, first with her husband Jim in the late 1950s, then later on her own. It was during this time that the Smithsonian Institution's Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage recorded Rosalie and Jim performing her collection of traditional songs. Many of these have been released by Smithsonian Folkways Recordings in various compilation albums throughout the last fifty years.|$|E
25|$|When he was 19, Riley met 15-year-old Marlene Olive while dealing {{drugs at}} her high school. He {{developed}} {{a crush on}} her and began to pursue her. Although she was initially put off by his weight, the couple eventually had sex and began a relationship largely controlled by Marlene Olive. Riley provided her with free drugs, gifts, and transportation, <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> problems, and sometimes helped her carry out sexual or criminal fantasies. She frequently threatened to break up with Riley unless he did what she wanted and claimed to have magical powers of control over him, in which he reportedly believed. He was anxious to please her {{in order to continue}} the relationship and twice attempted suicide when she briefly broke up with him. As she had with previous boyfriends, Marlene Olive soon began to ask Riley for help or advice in killing her mother or suggest that he himself kill her parents. Jim and Naomi Olive initially approved of their daughter dating Riley, finding him polite and responsible.|$|E

[...] Additionally, she <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> parents' favourite records by the likes of Cat Stevens, Neil Young and Fleetwood Mac in her early years.

500|$|Many factors {{went into}} the casting {{decisions}} of the season's guest stars. Linda Blair, famous {{for her role in}} the horror film The Exorcist, appeared in the episode [...] "The Usual Suspects". Though a fan of the show, Blair had turned down a guest appearance in the first season because {{she did not want to}} return to horror, having spent years getting a [...] "clean slate". This changed after the television series Extra aired a three-part profile on her acting career and work with animals. It attempted to find a series that would write a role for her as [...] "an actor's piece", rather than a cameo. Kripke, a fan of The Exorcist, offered to write an episode specifically for her, and she was [...] "really touched" [...] when he <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> request to leave out demons in the storyline.

Carey performed [...] "Touch My Body", [...] "I'm That Chick" [...] and [...] "We Belong Together". After the performance, Carey received strong praise from the program's cast members, with Lauren Conrad saying [...] "I've always been a huge Mariah fan, and she's just so beautiful and talented', while Whitney Port and Audrina Patridge referred to Carey as [...] "an amazing singer", while claiming to have <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> music from a young age. On July 22, 2008, Carey was announced as one of the performers at the 2008 Fashion Rocks ceremony. At the event on September 6, 2008, the event opened with a live performance of [...] "Just Stand Up", a charity single in which Carey partook alongside other female artists including Carrie Underwood. Carey later performed [...] "I'm That Chick" [...] alongside several male dancers, opening the song with a spontaneous a cappella of the track's chorus to positive critical response. A writer from Marie Claire complimented the performance, describing the rendition as [...] "true glamtastic Mariah style". A few days later, Carey reprised her performance of [...] "I'm That Chick" [...] on Canadian Idol, along with [...] "We Belong Together". The track was included on the set-list Carey's eighth concert tour The Elusive Chanteuse Show in 2014.|$|E
500|$|Following the song's digital release, Carey {{promoted}} the song on several live televised appearances and programs throughout the world.

500|$|The hearing {{took six}} days, {{finishing}} on 18 February 2008, with the judgment being made public on 17 March 2008. Mills was eventually awarded {{a lump sum}} of £16.5m, together with assets of £7.8m, which included the properties she owned at the time. The total was £24.3million (nearly $50 million in US currency,) plus payments of £35,000 per annum, for a nanny and school costs for their daughter. In his judgment, Justice Bennett [...] stated: [...] "The husband's evidence was, in my judgment, balanced. He expressed himself moderately though at times with justifiable irritation, if not anger. He was consistent, accurate and honest. But I regret {{to have to say}} I cannot say the same about the wife's evidence. Having watched and <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> give evidence, having studied the documents, and having given in her favour every allowance for the enormous strain she must have been under (and in conducting her own case) I am driven to the conclusion that much of her evidence, both written and oral, was not just inconsistent and inaccurate but also less than candid. Overall, she was a less than impressive witness." [...] Regarding her career, the judge said: [...] "I find that, far from the husband dictating to and restricting the wife's career and charitable activities, he did the exact opposite. He encouraged it and lent his support, name and reputation to her business and charitable activities. The facts as I find them do not in any way support her claim." [...] In anger at the judgment, Mills threw a pitcher of water on the head of Fiona Shackleton, McCartney's solicitor, in the courtroom.|$|E

She continued to say herself and label boss Simon Cowell discussed the possibility of Lewis recording a discussed cover version. Lewis cited her reason for wishing to record her own version as being a [...] "massive" [...] fan of rock bands, and that she wanted to put a [...] "different spin on it". When asked the question of if she knew what Gallagher thought about her version, she replied saying that she had not spoken to them and that she did not know if they had <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> version. Originally written solely by Gallagher, Lewis's cover version was produced by Steve Robson. Both Robson and Lewis were the vocal producers on [...] "Stop Crying Your Heart Out". It was engineered by Richard Flack, who was assisted in the process by vocal engineer Seth Waldmann. It was mixed by Jeremy Wheatly at Twenty-One Studios, located in London, England. A range of instrumentalists were bought in for the song; Karl Brazil played the drums, while Luke Potashnick provided guitar. John Garrison played the bass and Robson the piano. The London Session Orchestra performed the strings on [...] "Stop Crying Your Heart Out" [...] and it was arranged by Will Malone, while the choir was organised and arranged by Lawrence Johnson.

500|$|Before {{production}} began, {{the production}} team sought out Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, or Korean vocal talents. Tia Carrere {{was an early}} candidate to voice the title character, and Lea Salonga, {{who had been the}} singing voice of Princess Jasmine in Aladdin, was also cast as Mulan's speaking voice, but the directors did not find her attempt at a deeper speaking voice when Mulan impersonated Ping convincing, so Ming-Na Wen was brought in to speak the role. Salonga returned to provide the singing voice. Wen herself landed the role after the filmmakers <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> narration at the beginning of The Joy Luck Club. Coats reflected on her decision, stating [...] "When we heard Ming-Na doing that voice-over, we knew we had our Mulan. She has a very likable and lovely voice, and those are the qualities we were looking for." [...] For the role of Mushu, Disney was aiming for top Hollywood talent in the vein of Robin Williams's performance as the Genie, and approached Eddie Murphy, who at first balked during recording in the Disney studios, and asked to record the voice in his basement at his Bubble Hill mansion in Englewood, New Jersey. For the speaking voice of Captain Li Shang, B. D. Wong was hired, although his singing voice, for the song [...] "I'll Make a Man Out of You", was performed by Donny Osmond, who had originally auditioned as the speaking voice of the title character in Hercules. Osmond's casting originated from a suggestion from the casting director, and throughout recording, Osmond studied Wong's dialogue tapes, and aimed to match his inflections and personality. Osmond commented that his sons decided that he had finally [...] "made it" [...] in show business when he was in a Disney film. Likewise for the role of Grandmother Fa, June Foray provided for the speaking voice, and Marni Nixon supplied the singing voice.|$|E

2500|$|In 1995, Harris {{released}} one of {{the most}} critically acclaimed albums of the decade, Wrecking Ball, produced by Daniel Lanois, best known for his work with U2, Peter Gabriel and Bob Dylan.

U2's Larry Mullen, Jr., played drums for the project.

2500|$|Immediately {{after her}} win, Velasquez was signed to OctoArts International (currently PolyEast Records) {{and they began}} mapping out her {{commercial}} debut. Velasquez commenced recording her single [...] "Love Me Again", which was commercially released in early 1986. She was subsequently introduced as 'Chona' Velasquez, a reference to her personal nickname. Shortly after the release, the single failed to enter the Philippine music charts and became a commercial and critical disappointment. Despite the poor reception of her single, Velasquez still had musical ambitions and fully realized the challenges of pursuing a career in music following her tenure in reality singing competitions, she noted that [...] "it remains an enduring struggle, I thought after the win my dreams would all come true, it wasn’t like that". On February 16, 1986, {{at the behest of}} another recording artist under OctoArts, Pops Fernandez, Velasquez, was invited to appear at the former’s live late-night musical television show, The Penthouse Live!. While Velasquez was rehearsing for the live show, the producer and talent manager, Ronnie Henares, who <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> sing live showed keen interest saying [...] "she’s one of the new artists to look out for", and immediately signed her. At the suggestion of Fernandez's then husband and the show’s co-host, Martin Nievera, Velasquez dropped her screen name that ultimately led to her using 'Regine' from thereon.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1640s, the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland were {{dominated}} by a sequence of conflicts termed the English Civil War or the Wars of the Three Kingdoms; within England, the conflict centred on the rival Royalist and Parliamentarian factions. Henrietta Maria, as Charles' Queen, was to become heavily involved in this conflict {{that would result in}} her husband's death and her exile in France. There have been various schools of thought as to Henrietta Maria's role in the civil war period and the degree of her responsibility for the ultimate Royalist defeat. The traditional perspective on the Queen has suggested that she was a strong-willed woman who dominated her weaker-willed husband for the worst; the historian Wedgwood, for example, highlights Henrietta Maria's steadily increasing ascendancy over Charles, observing that [...] "he sought her advice on every subject, except religion" [...] and indeed complained that he could not make her an official member of his council. Reinterpretation in the 1970s argued that Henrietta Maria's political role was more limited, suggesting that the King took more decisions himself personally. Bone concludes, for example, that despite having a very close personal relationship with Henrietta Maria, Charles rarely <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> on matters of state politics. A third, more recent model argues that Henrietta Maria did indeed exercise political power and influence during the conflict, less so directly but more {{as a result of her}} public actions and deeds, which constrained and influenced the choices available to Charles.|$|E
