At the Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory (DMRL), Hyderabad, electroslag melting technologies {{have been developed for}} recycling <b>light</b> <b>scrap</b> of valuable metals and alloys such as superalloys and oxygen free high conductivity (OFHC) copper. Conventionally, electroslag melting processes use consumable electrodes. Because of the difficulty in compaction of scrap into a consumable electrode of satisfactory quality, non-consumable electrodes such as graphite and water-cooled copper have been designed. Electroslag remelting using water-cooled non-consumable electrode was used to melt scrap of a nickel base superalloy. Sound ingots with smooth surface finish and properties comparable to vacuum melted superalloys could be obtained from scrap using this process. OFHC copper scrap was melted by a modified electroslag crucible melting process using graphite crucible and graphite electrode. Process parameters including slag composition were optimised to produce copper ingots with oxygen less than 10 ppm and electrical conductivity approximate to 100 % IACS. The same process was also utilised to produce copper-chromium (Cu-Cr) ingots starting from copper scrap and pure chromium metal. The alloy exhibited superior room temperature tensile properties and high temperature ductility. Alternatively, Cu-Cr could also be produced by in-situ reduction of chromium oxide by aluminium during electroslag crucible melting...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to develop a new re-melting process for fine or <b>light</b> gauge aluminum <b>scrap</b> products that exhibits dramatic improvements in energy efficiency. <b>Light</b> gauge aluminum <b>scrap</b> in the form of chips, turnings, and borings has historically been underutilized in the aluminum recycling process due to its high surface area to volume ratio resulting in low melt recovery. Laboratory scale consolidation experiments were performed using loose aluminum powder as a modeling material as well as shredded aluminum wire scrap. The processing parameters necessary to create consolidated aluminum material were determined. Additionally, re-melting experiments using consolidated and unconsolidated aluminum powder confirmed the hypothesis that metal recovery using consolidated material will significantly improve by as much as 20 %. Based on this research, it is estimated that approximately 495 billion Btu/year can be saved by implementation of this technology in one domestic aluminum rolling plant alone. The energy savings are realized by substituting aluminum scrap for primary aluminum, which requires large amounts of energy to produce. While there will be an initial capital investment, companies will benefit from the reduction of dependence on primary aluminum thus saving considerable costs. Additionally, the technology will allow companies to maintain in-house alloy scrap, rather than purchasing from other vendors and eliminate the need to discard the <b>light</b> gauge <b>scrap</b> to landfills...|$|R

Through analyses of experimental results, some general conclusions were reached which those small cracks, in the surface of LMS that are continually struck by Impacting tools, formed during manufacture, originate very severe concentrations of stress and strain; the concentrations of stress and strain induce stability loss, extension, connection, perforation of small cracks on the surface of LMS; after that single fragments (200 mmx 200 mm) are torn off from the large plate-shaped of LMS. Under the guidance of analytical Study, damaging and shredding modes of LMS are investigated by using experiments.

40|$|Various {{solid state}} or ‘meltless’ {{recycling}} techniques {{have recently been}} developed for <b>light</b> metal <b>scrap</b> in form of chips. Main objective of all approaches is to bypass the need for remelting {{in order to reduce}} the overall required energy, and to avoid the material losses that occur during this step. Within this paper, the use of Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) is proposed as a novel solid state recycling/welding technique for sheet metal scrap. Aluminium 5182 alloy scrap, derived from sheet metal, was successfully consolidated into a fully dense billet via SPS. The use of pulsed electric current heating, in temperatures well below the alloy melting point, combined with mechanical pressure, enchased the densification process resulting into a void-less material. The recycled SPS sample was fully densified and microstructural investigation has been performed in order to confirm effective oxide film breakage. The results illustrate the effectiveness of SPS in aluminium scrap consolidation, also in form of sheet scrap, providing additional means in solid state recycling. The involved mechanisms that contribute to oxide film fracture and scrap consolidation in SPS are being discussed. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Whereas {{industrial}} symbiosis {{has led to}} increased energy and resource efficiency in process industries, this concept {{has not yet been}} applied in discrete product manufacturing. Metal scrap is first conventionally recycled, for which substantial energy and resource efficiency losses have been reported. Recent research has however proven the feasibility of ‘meltless’ recycling of <b>light</b> metal <b>scrap,</b> yielding a first glimpse of potential {{industrial symbiosis}}. Various solid state recycling techniques (such as recycling via hot extrusion, via or Spark Plasma Sintering) have been proposed for scrap consolidation directly into bulk products or semis by physical disruption and dispersion of the oxide surface film by imposing significant plastic and shear strain. Solid State Recycling (SSR) methods can omit these substantial material losses as they bypass the metallurgical recycling step. In this context various SSR methods are presented as well as the case of direct production of bulk aluminium profiles via hot extrusion at industrial scale is demonstrated. The experiments were performed directly into the production line, highlighting the scaling up potentials and the industrial relevance of this research. A significant amount of machining chips were collected, chemically cleaned and cold compacted into chip based billets with ~ 80 % relative density. Afterwards the scrap consolidation was achieved by imposing significant plastic and shear deformation into the material during hot extrusion through a modified 2 -porthole extrusion die.

40|$|ARCO Metals Company (Formerly Anaconda Aluminum Company) is {{proceeding}} as scheduled {{with the construction}} of a $ 400 Million aluminum processing complex in Logan County, Kentucky. When the initial construction phase is completed in the Fall 1983, the complex will be capable of producing 400 million pounds per year of aluminum, sheet and foil using highly automated, computer controlled equipment that will maximize end product quality and minimize the consumption of energy. This paper will describe the basic processes used in the Logan complex and several design features that are being incorporated to reduce energy consumption. Large reverberatroy melting furnaces will remelt scrap aluminum and ingots will be cast on site to supplement those delivered to the site from ARCO Metal's reduction plants. The melting furnaces are expected to achieve a high efficiency which will be further enhanced by the utilization of exhaust gases to preheat the scrap as well as the combustion air. A coreless induction furnace will be used to reduce the melt loss normally associated with <b>light</b> gauge <b>scrap.</b> The ingots will be heated prior to rolling in the hot mill in direct fired preheating furnaces with variable speed fans that minimize cycle time.

If I then press it upon a piece of paper, held against the ball of my thumb, the paper is indelibly perforated with a fine hole, and the thumb is not wounded.
