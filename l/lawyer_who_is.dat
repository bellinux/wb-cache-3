25|$|In the United States, {{the term}} public defender {{is often used}} to {{describe}} a <b>lawyer</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> appointed by a court to represent a defendant who cannot afford to hire an attorney.

The court appoints the public defender's office to represent the defendant, and the office assigns a lawyer to the defendant's case. In the federal criminal court system and some states and counties, representation is through a publicly-funded public defender office.|$|E

25|$|Unlike many {{civil law}} countries; which have some courts on which panels of judges with nearly equal status {{composed}} of both legally trained professional judges and lay judges who lack legal training {{and are not}} career judges, the United States legal system (like most Anglo-American legal systems) makes {{a clear distinction between}} professional judges and laypeople involved in deciding a case who are jurors who are part of a jury. Most but not all US judges have professional credentials as lawyers. Non-lawyer judges in the United States are often elected, and are typically either justices of the peace or part-time judges in rural limited jurisdiction courts. A non-lawyer judge typically has the same rights and responsibilities as a <b>lawyer</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> a judge holding the same office and is addressed in the same manner.|$|E
