5|$|Cunningham {{was allowed}} back onto operations. He was given command of No. 85 Squadron RAF, {{equipped}} with the de Havilland Mosquito NF.II based at Hunsdon. He selected Jimmy Rawnsley as his operator. The radar set displayed the entire picture. A small cathode-ray tube set {{on the left side}} of the instrument panel gave Cunningham a composite image. The duo decided Rawnsley should control the interception in the initial stages until they reached a point where the enemy could take evasive action. Then Cunningham would take over while Rawnsley would call out the ranges and free the pilot from <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> ray-tube.|$|E
5|$|Lichtenstein {{frequently}} explored vision-related themes {{after he}} began {{to work in the}} pop art genre; early examples include I Can See the Whole Room...and There's Nobody in It! and Look Mickey. In this painting, Donald's large eyes indicate his belief that he has caught something big while Mickey's small eyes indicate his disbelief that Donald has caught anything significant. Like Lichenstein's works with subjects looking through a periscope (Torpedo...Los!), a mirror (Girl in Mirror) or a peephole (I Can See the Whole Room... and There's Nobody in It!), Look Mickey, with a subject <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> reflection in the water, is a prominent example of the theme of vision. He uses narrative to emphasize this motif, while presenting several visual elements.|$|E

He instructs Susan, who was the last one known to the police to see Mr. Griffin, to tell them Mr. Griffin kept <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> watch during the conference and left with a pretty woman. Jeff, Mark, and David bury the body in the mountains. Betsy and David also drive Mr. Griffin's car to the airport, but the officer who gave Betsy a ticket sees her there. Worried that the officer might later identify the car as Mr. Griffin's, Jeff and Betsy move the car into Jeff's garage so he can repaint it before they hide it elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Usher {{sitting on a}} sofa with a {{backdrop}} of his girlfriend. When the verse starts, Usher goes to a wide glass window pane, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> girlfriend swimming in the pool. The surface is aflame after she is immersed in the water. In the next scene, Usher and his mistress are having sex. While {{sitting on the edge}} of the bed, Usher reminisces about the moments he and his girlfriend had have in the same bed. The bedsheets burn, the scene then cutting to Usher riding a silver right-hand drive Aston Martin DB5 with a British registration - EGF 158B (the car was featured in the TV series Fastlane). The video cuts with the backdrop also burning. Continuing to the car scene, Usher stops as he sees his imaginary girl again. He and dances, executing various hand routines. Video intercuts follow and the video ends with Usher standing. Right before the last chorus, the screen changes from a small screen to a full one with no framework.|$|E
5|$|A rocket-ship {{carrying}} astronaut John Corcoran (Michael Emmet) launches and orbits the Earth, {{marking the}} United States' first manned space launch. Shortly after taking off, {{the ship is}} struck by an unknown object, forcing Corcoran to abort the mission and land. However, the equipment cannot handle the fast descent back into the atmosphere and the ship crash lands in the woods, killing Corcoran. Dave Randall (Ed Nelson) and Donna Bixby (Georgianna Carter), two technicians from a nearby space agency tracking station, locate the crashed ship and recover Corcoran's body. They are baffled, however, by {{what appears to be}} a giant tear in the side of the destroyed spacecraft and a mud-like substance covering some of the wreckage. Randall and Bixby are joined by lead scientist Dr. Alex Wyman (Tyler McVey), technician Steve Dunlap (John Baer) and physician Julie Benson (Angela Greene), who was also Corcoran's fiancee. Wyman observes that Corcoran's body exhibits no signs of rigor mortis, and that the blood pooling beside him is not livid as it should be. The team brings the corpse back to their lab to run tests and find further irregularities. Although the body lacks a heartbeat or pulse, it maintains the blood pressure of a living human being. After <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> blood in a microscope, they find unusual, unidentifiable cells that seem resistant to destruction from human white blood cells.|$|E

5|$|The film's setting, {{which appears}} to be a major city, is never {{identified}} in The Brute Man, but {{it has been suggested that}} it is Manhattan, since that is where House of Horrors took place. Commentators have noted similarities between The Brute Man and other films, including the Charlie Chaplin silent comedy City Lights (1931), and the Universal Pictures horror film Bride of Frankenstein (1935). City Lights, like The Brute Man, included a protagonist (Chaplin's Tramp character) who falls in love with a blind girl and seeks money for an operation to restore her eyesight. Likewise, the scenes between the Creeper and Helen Paige share a similar premise and dialogue as the scenes between Frankenstein's monster and the blind hermit in Bride of Frankenstein. In both films, the protagonists are shunned by society based on their physical appearance, but find companionship in a blind loner who knows nothing about their deformities. In both instances, the protagonist is first drawn to their blind companions by music. The Creeper heard Helen playing the piano, while Frankenstein's monster heard the hermit playing the violin. Commentators have noted other similarities between the two films. For example, the Creeper smashes a mirror after <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> misshapen face, much like the Monster lashes out at his reflection in a waterfall pool.|$|E

500|$|In early 2004, Usher {{broke up}} with Chilli due to [...] "irreconcilable {{differences}} and because they found {{it almost impossible to}} make compromises." [...] Usher said in an interview: [...] "It's unfortunate when you have to let a situation go because it's not working", which added reference to the breakup. It was later revealed that Chilli in fact {{broke up with}} Usher because of cheating, and the media said otherwise because of the lyrics in the song, which was not based on their relationship. Dupri, however, confessed that his personal life is the real story of the album. Usher said he took inspiration collectively by <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> friends' personal situations.|$|E
500|$|Every summer, Hayao Miyazaki {{spent his}} {{vacation}} at a mountain cabin {{with his family}} and five girls who were friends of the family. The idea for Spirited Away came about when he wanted to make a film for these friends. Miyazaki had previously directed films such as My Neighbor Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service, which were for small children and teenagers, but he had not created a film for ten-year-old girls. For inspiration, he read shōjo manga magazines like [...] Nakayoshi and Ribon the girls had left at the cabin, but felt they only offered subjects on [...] "crushes" [...] and romance. When <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> young friends, Miyazaki felt this was not what they [...] "held dear in their hearts" [...] and decided to produce the film about a girl heroine whom they could look up to instead.|$|E

500|$|After {{not being}} able to find a baby-sitter for Amy, Reagan {{suggests}} that the two throw a game night, an idea Chris doesn't react well to. They invite Ava, Kevin, Missy, but Chris attempts to hide the games due to Reagan's competitive nature. He tries to make her promise that she won't be too competitive, but she does which makes the party awkward. While playing Rock Band the two get in a fight when Chris loses the beat on the drums because he was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> [...] "drumming arm". Reagan decide to a make a list of [...] "Things We Are Going to Stop Doing That Embarrass Each Other in 2012", which features annoying habits that the two want each other to give up. However, before 2011 comes to an end the two erase every thing from the list except for Chris's Borat impression and Reagen's competitive nature.|$|E
500|$|The {{day after}} the game, Vézina was {{diagnosed}} with tuberculosis and advised to return home. He made a last trip into the Canadiens' dressing room on [...] to say a final goodbye to his teammates. Dandurand would later describe Vézina as sitting in his corner of the dressing room with [...] "tears rolling down his cheeks. He was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> old pads and skates that Eddie Dufour [...] had arranged in Georges' corner. Then, he asked one little favour—the sweater he had worn in the last world series." [...] Vézina returned to his hometown of Chicoutimi with his wife Marie, where {{he died in the}} early hours on Saturday, March 27, 1926, at l'Hôtel-Dieu hospital. Though he played only one period for the Canadiens during the entire season, the team honoured his entire $6,000 salary, a testament to how important Vézina had been to the team.|$|E
500|$|The {{special effects}} and makeup {{departments}} {{are also important}} assets to production. Dean has an out-of-body experience in [...] "In My Time of Dying", and some scenes feature him <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> own body in a hospital bed. To forgo the use of visual effects, the special effects department sculpted a full gelatin face from Ackles, and applied it to a body double. To depict a woman burning {{to death in the}} episode [...] "Simon Said", the actress was sealed inside a full body silicone designed to look like her, and was doused with fire accelerant. She was required to breathe through a straw, as well as don underwear soaked in ice-cold fire-retardant gel. Prior to [...] "Heart", Kripke had not wanted to include werewolves in the series, as he felt that the budget would only allow for [...] "a guy with fur glued to his face". As he prefers to have monsters be able to walk among humans, production made the transformation subtle—the character's eyes change, and her canine teeth and fingernails grow. However, writer Sera Gamble believes that they [...] "dropped the ball" [...] in the design, feeling that the creature looked too similar to a vampire.|$|E

500|$|The film cuts to {{the closing}} credits from {{a shot of the}} top {{apparently}} starting to show an ever so faint wobble, inviting speculation about whether the final sequence was reality or another dream. Nolan confirmed that the ambiguity was deliberate, saying, [...] "I've been asked the question more times than I've ever been asked any other question about any other film I've made... What's funny to me is that people really do expect me to answer it." [...] The film's script concludes with [...] "Behind him, on the table, the spinning top is STILL SPINNING. And we – FADE OUT". [...] Nolan said, [...] "I put that cut there at the end, imposing an ambiguity from outside the film. That always felt the right ending to me — it always felt like the appropriate 'kick' to me... The real point of the scene — and this is what I tell people — is that Cobb isn't looking at the top. He's <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> kids. He's left it behind. That's the emotional significance of the thing." [...] Also, Michael Caine explained his interpretation of the ending, saying, [...] "If I'm there it's real, because I'm never in the dream. I'm the guy who invented the dream." ...|$|E
500|$|According to legend, the Gautama Buddha [...] visited Dhanyawadi, {{the capital}} city of Arakan during his travels on a Proselytization mission to spread Buddhism. During the 26th anniversary of the King at the time, a devout Buddhist, the Buddha {{accompanied}} by Shin Ananda and 500 disciples landed at Salagiri mountain peak near Khaukrah town. The King of Arakan, along with his Chief Queen Sandra Mala (with her retinue of 1,600 ladies in waiting), and an entourage of ministers, generals and officials, paid homage to the Buddha. They were deeply moved by his teachings and upon his departure to Thawuthi (Sravasti), the King insisted that he leave his image for people to worship. For this purpose, the Buddha then sat under a Bodhi tree for a week of meditation. During this time Sakka (in Pāli, the ruler of the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven in Buddhist cosmology, supported by his assistant Vissakamma, moulded a lifelike image of the Buddha using ornaments donated by the king and his people. It is also said that Sakka and Vissakamma (or Vishvakarman) created a separate pavilion for the Buddha to live and enjoy during these seven days. After <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> own lifelike image, believed at the time to have been his only true-likeness, Buddha was pleased and [...] "imbued the image with his spiritual essence", or [...] "enlivened and consecrated" [...] the image, naming it [...] "Candasara". He also stated that the image would last for five thousand years as his representative.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} well {{received}} by film critics {{and even the}} passing mentions in The Moving Picture World remarked {{that it was a}} good offering with good photography. Jack Harvey's debut film as a director was well received by the public due to its [...] "universally appealing" [...] theme. Thanhouser writes that the [...] "loyal dog's attachment to his little girl playmate is treated with pictorial beauty and simple, honest sentiment", and notes that when it was released on October 4, 1914, reviewers praised the [...] "double-exposure passages for their dramatic effectiveness". Louis Reeves Harrison of The Moving Picture World review of the film stated, [...] "This play becomes one of delicate pathos toward the end through some remarkable feats of double exposure, and it is one of beauty throughout because of the acting of a four-year-old tot, Baby Helen, a veritable star in her class. Shep contributes with exceptional intelligence - he is not eternally <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> master out of scope for a word of command. ... I do not know what director handled this subject, but I suggest he apply his thought visualizations to the human characters of future stories. It is the exhibition of what passes in the minds and hearts of characters that brings an audience into closer sympathy with them and makes tense interest possible when melodrama merely brings a laugh. The double exposures are timed with such skill in this instance that all concerned in their production deserve high praise. They give beauty and dignity to a very simple story." ...|$|E
