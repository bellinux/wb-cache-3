5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of {{retinopathy of prematurity}} in infants is typically suggested by the clinical setting. Prematurity, <b>low</b> <b>birth</b> <b>weight</b> {{and a history of}} oxygen exposure are the principal indicators, while no hereditary factors have been shown to yield a pattern.|$|E
5|$|Teenage pregnancies, {{especially}} among younger teens, are {{at greater risk}} of adverse outcomes including early birth, <b>low</b> <b>birth</b> <b>weight,</b> and death of the infant. In the United States 82% of pregnancies in those between 15 and 19 are unplanned. Comprehensive sex education and access to birth control are effective in decreasing pregnancy rates in this age group.|$|E
5|$|A {{pregnant}} woman's elevated {{blood lead}} level can lead to miscarriage, prematurity, <b>low</b> <b>birth</b> <b>weight,</b> and problems with development during childhood. Lead is able {{to pass through the}} placenta and into breast milk, and {{blood lead level}}s in mothers and infants are usually similar. A fetus may be poisoned in utero if lead from the mother's bones is subsequently mobilized by the changes in metabolism due to pregnancy; increased calcium intake in pregnancy may help mitigate this phenomenon.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} other factors are less closely linked to COPD. The risk is greater in those who are poor, {{although}} it is not clear if this is due to poverty itself or other risk factors associated with poverty, such as air pollution and malnutrition. There is tentative evidence that those with asthma and airway hyperreactivity are at increased risk of COPD. Birth factors such as <b>low</b> <b>birth</b> <b>weight</b> may also play a role as do a number of infectious diseases including HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Respiratory infections such as pneumonia do not appear to increase the risk of COPD, at least in adults.|$|E
5|$|A {{woman who}} has {{elevated}} blood lead levels during pregnancy is {{at greater risk of}} a prematurely birth or with a <b>low</b> <b>birth</b> <b>weight.</b> Children are more at risk for lead poisoning because their smaller bodies are in a continuous state of growth and development. Lead is absorbed at a faster rate compared to adults, which causes more physical harm than to older people. Furthermore, children, especially as they are learning to crawl and walk, are constantly on the floor and therefore more prone to ingesting and inhaling dust that is contaminated with lead.|$|E
5|$|Acute {{toxicity}} has {{not been}} seen in humans, and the toxicity depends strongly on the chemical state. Studies on rats show a median lethal dose (LD50) as low as 180mg/kg for some Mo compounds. Although human toxicity data is unavailable, animal studies have shown that chronic ingestion of more than 10mg/day of molybdenum can cause diarrhea, growth retardation, infertility, <b>low</b> <b>birth</b> <b>weight,</b> and gout; it can also affect the lungs, kidneys, and liver. Sodium tungstate is a competitive inhibitor of molybdenum. Dietary tungsten reduces the concentration of molybdenum in tissues.|$|E
25|$|In {{recent years}} {{correlations}} between <b>birth</b> <b>weight</b> and shyness have been studied. Findings suggest that those born at <b>low</b> <b>birth</b> <b>weights</b> {{are more likely}} to be shy, risk-aversive and cautious compared to those born at normal <b>birth</b> <b>weights.</b> These results do not however imply a cause-and-effect relationship.|$|R

5|$|Nearly {{two billion}} {{people in the}} {{developing}} world are deficient in zinc. In children, it causes an increase in infection and diarrhea and contributes to the death of about 800,000 children worldwide per year. The World Health Organization advocates zinc supplementation for severe malnutrition and diarrhea. Zinc supplements help prevent disease and reduce mortality, especially among children with <b>low</b> <b>birth</b> <b>weight</b> or stunted growth. However, zinc supplements should not be administered alone, because many {{in the developing world}} have several deficiencies, and zinc interacts with other micronutrients.|$|E
5|$|Those {{who have}} {{bacteria}} in the urine but no symptoms should not generally be treated with antibiotics. This includes those who are old, those with spinal cord injuries, {{and those who have}} urinary catheters. Pregnancy is an exception and it is recommended that women take 7days of antibiotics. If not treated it causes up to 30% of mothers to develop pyelonephritis and increases risk of <b>low</b> <b>birth</b> <b>weight</b> and preterm birth. Some also support treatment of those with diabetes mellitus and treatment before urinary tract procedures which will likely cause bleeding.|$|E
5|$|When {{warfarin}} (or another 4-hydroxycoumarin derivative) {{is given}} {{during the first}} trimester—particularly between the sixth and ninth weeks of pregnancy—a constellation of birth defects known variously as fetal warfarin syndrome (FWS), warfarin embryopathy, or coumarin embryopathy can occur. FWS is characterized mainly by skeletal abnormalities, which include nasal hypoplasia, a depressed or narrowed nasal bridge, scoliosis, and calcifications in the vertebral column, femur, and heel bone, which show a peculiar stippled appearance on X-rays. Limb abnormalities, such as brachydactyly (unusually short fingers and toes) or underdeveloped extremities, can also occur. Common nonskeletal features of FWS include <b>low</b> <b>birth</b> <b>weight</b> and developmental disabilities.|$|E
25|$|Severe {{deficiency}} of copper in pregnant mothers {{increases the risk}} of health problems in their fetuses and infants.

5|$|In the United States, {{infertility}} affects 1.5 million couples. Many couples seek assisted reproductive technology (ART) for infertility. In the United States in 2010, 147,260 {{in vitro}} fertilization (IVF) procedures were carried out, with 47,090 live births resulting. In 2013 these numbers had increased to 160,521 and 53,252. However, about a half of IVF pregnancies result in multiple-birth deliveries, which in turn are associated {{with an increase in}} both morbidity and mortality of the mother and the infant. Causes for this include increased maternal blood pressure, premature birth and <b>low</b> <b>birth</b> <b>weight.</b> In addition, more women are waiting longer to conceive and seeking ART.|$|E
5|$|The {{circumcision}} procedure causes pain, and for neonates {{this pain}} {{may interfere with}} mother-infant interaction or cause other behavioral changes, so the use of analgesia is advocated. Ordinary procedural pain may be managed in pharmacological and non-pharmacological ways. Pharmacological methods, such as localized or regional pain-blocking injections and topical analgesic creams, are safe and effective. The ring block and dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) are the most effective at reducing pain, and the ring block {{may be more effective}} than the DPNB. They are more effective than EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics) cream, which is more effective than a placebo. Topical creams have been found to irritate the skin of <b>low</b> <b>birth</b> <b>weight</b> infants, so penile nerve block techniques are recommended in this group.|$|E

40|$|The risk of <b>low</b> <b>birth</b> <b>weights</b> is {{elevated}} in prenatal expo-sure to polycyclic {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs), which are ubiquitous environmental pollutants generated from combustion of organic compounds, including cigarette smoke.

HSMPCs were isolated by a modified pre-plate technique and cultured in myogenic differentiation media with or without BaP and BPDE (0. 25 and 0. 5 M) for 4 days. The multinucleated myotube formation was morphologically analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin staining.

25|$|Inhalation of PM2.5 – PM10 is {{associated}} with elevated risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as <b>low</b> <b>birth</b> <b>weight.</b> Exposure to PM2.5 {{has been associated with}} greater reductions in birth weight than exposure to PM10. PM exposure can cause inflammation, oxidative stress, endocrine disruption, and impaired oxygen transport access to the placenta, all of which are mechanisms for heightening the risk of <b>low</b> <b>birth</b> <b>weight.</b> Overall epidemiologic and toxicological evidence suggests that a causal relationship exists between long-term exposures to PM2.5 and developmental outcomes (i.e. <b>low</b> <b>birth</b> <b>weight).</b> However, studies investigating the significance of trimester-specific exposure have proven to be inconclusive, and results of international studies have been inconsistent in drawing associations of prenatal particulate matter exposure and <b>low</b> <b>birth</b> <b>weight.</b> As perinatal outcomes have been associated with lifelong health and exposure to particulate matter is widespread, this issue is of critical public health importance and additional research will be essential to inform public policy on the matter.|$|E
