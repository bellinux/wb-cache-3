5000|$|... "Fringe sure has {{a pattern}} alright — take one {{excellent}} plot-propelling episode {{and follow it}} up with a complete waste of time. The only worthwhile development in 'Snakehead' was Walter's decision to place a tracking implant in his neck, which will undoubtedly pay off in a future episode. Aside from that, some solid performances and a gag-inducing mystery of the week, the <b>latest</b> <b>Fringe</b> episode was entirely pointless {{in the grand scheme of}} things."

500|$|... "The Transformation" [...] was co-written by Zack Whedon and supervising {{producer}} J.R. Orci. Whedon {{had last}} co-written the season's ninth episode, [...] "The Dreamscape", while Orci helped write [...] "The Equation", the season's eighth episode. Producer Brad Anderson served as director, his <b>latest</b> <b>Fringe</b> work since directing [...] "In Which We Meet Mr. Jones" [...] six episodes earlier. The episode resolved the John Scott storyline and featured the last appearance of actor Mark Valley. Media outlets speculated that because Valley and Torv married over the holiday break, his departure [...] "would eliminate any chances {{of the marriage}} conflicting with the show." [...] Co-creator Roberto Orci called Scott's final scene a [...] "truly satisfactory conclusion to his story." ...|$|R
500|$|Fearnet's Alyse Wax wrote, [...] "I {{definitely}} {{think that this}} was the best [...] "over there" [...] episode they have had so far. They had an actual case, rather than still setting up who these doppelgangers are." [...] HitFix writer Ryan McGee thought the initial twist over the brothers' identities [...] "was fun", though it [...] "grew old quickly". He praised the series for not [...] "dragging out" [...] Olivia discovering her true identity, explaining [...] "While episodes set Over There are delicious fun, having Olivia unaware for a long stretch would have strained credibility and perhaps damaged audience opinion of her character’s integrity." [...] Writing for Den of Geek, Billy Grifter commented, [...] "I have three words for the <b>latest</b> <b>Fringe</b> episode, and they're all 'brilliant'. Season three has moved gracefully, like a big cat stalking its prey, from the outset, playing a flipside game where we cleverly alternate between our universe and an alternate one where Olivia is currently resident." [...] Grifter praised the Ashmore brothers' acting as well as their characters' storylines, calling their switch [...] "a nice twist that's cleverly played".|$|R
50|$|Primetime is officially, {{in terms}} of ratings figure designations, from 6:00 p.m. until midnight, however the peak audiences are between 6:00 and 10:30 p.m. Primetime {{programming}} is advertised as starting from 7:30 p.m., with more family-friendly programs airing during this time, until classification restrictions allow for racier content from 8:30 p.m. There is a small audience drop off at 9:30 p.m., and a significant audience drop off after 10:30 p.m., with not much promotion given to programmes airing after this time. Late local news programmes only air {{on one of the}} three networks. As a result, the <b>late</b> <b>fringe</b> occurs from 10:30 p.m. to around 12:30 a.m., depending on the programme which proceeds it.|$|E
5000|$|Syndicated {{programs}} {{broadcast by}} KSBI [...] include Law and Order: Criminal Intent, The King of Queens, Supreme Justice with Judge Karen, Access Hollywood Live, King of the Hill and Dr. Phil. In {{addition to its}} primary affiliation with the MyNetworkTV programming service, KSBI is designated as an alternate CBS affiliate, and carries network programs that KWTV-DT must preempt to carry extended breaking news or severe weather coverage or special event programming (the station is not currently used to run select CBS programs that are not cleared to air on KWTV's main channel, with that responsibility continuing to be delegated to its parent station's News 9 Now subchannel). Since the programming service consists of off-network reruns, KSBI may also broadcast MyNetworkTV programs on tape delay to air in the late prime time or <b>late</b> <b>fringe</b> slots (to fulfill contractual advertising makegoods), {{in the event that}} the station carries CBS network programs normally carried on KWTV or sporting events.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} founded on December 20, 1953 as KID-TV, co-owned with KID radio (AM 590 and FM 96.1). The station has been a primary {{affiliate}} of CBS since its debut, but carried secondary affiliations with the DuMont Television Network until its 1955 shutdown, NBC until 1961 (moving to KIFI-TV thereafter until swapping affiliations with KPVI in 1996) and ABC until 1974 when KPVI became a primary affiliate of the network upon that station's sign on. KID-TV changed its callsign to KIDK on December 18, 1984, when the radio stations were sold. After dropping its secondary NBC affiliation, KIDK had an exclusive affiliation with CBS until September 1994, as it began carrying Fox shows in <b>late</b> <b>fringe</b> hours. This allowed the station to continue airing NFL football, which moved to Fox during the 1994 United States broadcast TV realignment. In 1996, KIDK agreed to carry UPN as a third affiliation (KPID-LP, now KXPI-LD, affiliated with the network when it debuted in June 2001; however, KIDK continued its secondary affiliation with the network until 2003). Star Trek: Voyager, the highest-rated UPN program, was cleared in market on KPVI as station management replaced NYPD Blue, feeling it was too vulgar for local market standards. NYPD Blue aired in its scheduled timeslot on KIFI once it became affiliated with ABC.|$|E
5000|$|... "This <b>latest</b> {{installment}} of <b>Fringe</b> certainly {{had some good}} points. It was well directed, it {{had a number of}} funny moments, and it gave us some different perspective on our lead characters.

40|$|The CHARA array {{achieved}} first <b>fringes</b> <b>late</b> {{last year}} and is currently being expanded on Mount Wilson CA. This presentation is a follow on from the overview given by Hal McAlister and will give more technical detail on the optical systems, {{with a focus on}} the telescopes, the delay lines, the control system, and the beam combining scheme. Combining more than three beams is not a simple problem with no obvious best solution, and we have by no means locked ourselves into a particular design. Preliminary designs will be shown, the first beam combiner will also be discussed along with our plans for future development...|$|R
40|$|A {{monolithic}} x-ray interferometer {{has been}} developed which provides a means of producing high-quality x-ray Moire fringes with readily controlled pitch (spacing). It {{was designed as a}} calibrator of sub-microradian angular displacements and it has successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the approach. The quality of its output, when combined with the phase imaging capabilities of interferometry and the <b>latest</b> generation of <b>fringe</b> analysis algorithms, suggests additional, novel applications. This paper first reviews the principles and performance of the system as an angular calibrator and then discusses the potential of x-ray Moire patterns {{in the form of an}} x-ray microscope and as a diagnostic tool for ultra-precision metrology. Demonstration results are given mostly in the form of images of fringe fields, since the point here is the production of original data suitable for processing by existing techniques...|$|R
40|$|New mapping in the Lake Kaweah pendant of {{the southwestern}} Sierra Nevada {{batholith}} reveals a previously unrecognized nonmarine sequence of metamorphosed sedimentary and volcanic strata, defined herein as the Goldstein Peak Formation. The nonmarine origin distinguishes the Goldstein Peak Formation {{from all other}} Sierra Nevada metasedimentary pendants and from virtually all other coeval deposits associated with the Sierra Nevada arc. Basic structural relations, supplemented by new U-Pb zircon ages, suggest an Early Cretaceous depositional age, a time that is poorly represented within the stratigraphic record of California. This unusual age makes the Goldstein Peak Formation the youngest sedimentary deposit preserved within the metamorphic framework of the exhumed batholith, one that was deposited concurrently {{with some of the}} earliest deposits in the Great Valley forearc basin and just preceding the mid-Cretaceous Sierra Nevada arc surge. Preserved sedimentary and volcanic structures, along with whole-rock geochemistry, are consistent with deposition of Goldstein Peak conglomerates and sandstones within fluvial and alluvial fan environments, deposition of mud-rich sediments and air-fall tuffs within a lacustrine(?) environment, and subaqueous to subaerial extrusion of basaltic to dacitic arc volcanic rocks. This volcano-sedimentary section was intruded soon after deposition, with peak hornblende hornfels to low-pressure amphibolite facies metamorphism ultimately driven by intrusion of the surrounding Early Cretaceous Stokes Mountain ring dike complexes. Deposition of the nonmarine Goldstein Peak Formation within a fault-bounded, possibly transtensional, intra-arc basin during the transition from the low-standing, moderately extensional, <b>Late</b> Jurassic <b>fringing</b> arc to the high-standing, compressional mid- to Late Cretaceous arc indicates that at least one section of the Sierra Nevada arc was a fully emergent continental margin arc by the Early Cretaceous Epoch...|$|R
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Andrew Hanson {{from the}} Los Angeles Times thought the episode continued the series' season three [...] "hot streak", but wished the promo had not spoiled Senator Van Horn being a shapeshifter. Hanson {{also did not}} fully buy into the Peter-Fauxlivia relationship, as he expected Peter to realize something different about her. Noel Murray from The A.V. Club loved the shapeshifter focus of the episode and graded it an A-, explaining it was a [...] "very strong episode" [...] that [...] "brings back {{one of my favorite}} Fringe concepts: those crazy super-powered shapeshifters". MTV's Josh Wigler also enjoyed the shapeshifter plot, and wrote that [...] "the <b>latest</b> episode of <b>Fringe</b> marks four fantastic installments in a row, instantly establishing season three as having the strongest opening act of any other previous year in the science fiction series. Fringe has reinvented itself by drastically altering just one ingredient in the show's successful format — namely, the true identity of Olivia Dunham — to create something wholly new and amazing". Television Without Pity gave the episode an A-.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{global warming}} is {{pronounced}} in high-latitude regions (e. g. northern Asia), and will cause the vegetation to change. Future vegetation trends (e. g. the ``arctic greening'') will feed back into atmospheric circulation and the global climate system. Understanding the nature and causes of past vegetation changes is important for predicting the composition and distribution of future vegetation communities. Fossil pollen records from 468 sites in northern and eastern Asia were biomised at selected times between 40  cal ka bp and today. Biomes were also simulated using a climate-driven biome model and results from the two approaches compared {{in order to help}} understand the mechanisms behind the observed vegetation changes. The consistent biome results inferred by both approaches reveal that long-term and broad-scale vegetation patterns reflect global- to hemispheric-scale climate changes. Forest biomes increase around the beginning of the late deglaciation, become more widespread during the early and middle Holocene, and decrease in the <b>late</b> Holocene in <b>fringe</b> areas of the Asian Summer Monsoon. At the southern and southwestern margins of the taiga, forest increases in the early Holocene and shows notable species succession, which may have been caused by winter warming at ca. 7  cal ka bp. At the northeastern taiga margin (central Yakutia and northeastern Siberia), shrub expansion during the last deglaciation appears to prevent the permafrost from thawing and hinders the northward expansion of evergreen needle-leaved species until ca. 7  cal ka bp. The vegetation-climate disequilibrium during the early Holocene in the taiga-tundra transition zone suggests that projected climate warming will not cause a northward expansion of evergreen needle-leaved species...|$|R
