An en banc panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed.|$|E
5|$|At each venue, {{the concert}} {{was treated as}} a major event by the <b>local</b> <b>press</b> and {{attended}} by between ten and twenty thousand fans, whose enthusiastic response to the Beatles produced sound levels that left the music only semi-audible. The tour earned the Beatles over a million dollars in ticket sales. It also stimulated a further increase in record sales, and resulted in the sale of a considerable quantity of Beatle-related merchandise.|$|E

5|$|Local Conservative Associations {{began to}} educate {{citizens}} about the Party's platform and {{encouraged them to}} register to vote annually, as mandated by the Act. Press coverage of national politics in the <b>local</b> <b>press</b> was joined by in-depth reports on provincial politics in the national press. Grassroots Conservatives therefore saw themselves {{as part of a}} national political movement during the 1830s.|$|E
5|$|More {{controversy}} {{surrounded the}} choice of architect. The Manchester Art Federation and other bodies petitioned the city council to hold an open competition, to which the council agreed. The war memorial committee appointed Percy Worthington, a local architect, as the assessor for the competition but attracted severe criticism in the <b>local</b> <b>press</b> when it reserved the right to veto Worthington's choice.

50|$|As new {{universities}} {{opened in}} Africa after 1960, some developed a press {{based on the}} European model. In Nigeria for an example, scholarly presses {{played a central role}} in shaping and encouraging intellectual efforts and gaining international attention for the product. However the established European presses, especially Oxford University Press, dominated the market, allowing a narrow niche for new <b>local</b> <b>presses</b> such as Ibadan University Press.|$|R
40|$|The {{changes that}} have been {{introduced}} lately in Hungary affected several levels of regional organization. Yet they have not realized an overall system that could be put in effect after criteria have changed. In my research I map how the <b>local</b> <b>press’s</b> influene and thematizing scope depend on countrywide power relations and how are the central and the local political directives interrelated. I will make my theses in view of these aspects. ...|$|R

Mayor William Hale Thompson tried to evict the Streeters for selling liquor, and after several eviction attempts and gun battles, Streeter landed in jail. In 1918, the courts ruled against his claim of sovereignty. Today, the district is home {{to some of the most}} expensive real estate in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|Back in Kristiansund, Løvold {{started working}} {{with the idea of}} {{building}} a subsea road tunnel from Kristiansund to the mainland. He discussed the issue in Foreningen Kristiansunderen where it received support. Løvold was an important enthusiast for the fixed link project, which would materialize as the Kristiansund and Frei Fixed Link in 1992. The <b>local</b> <b>press</b> dubbed him the fixed link general. In 1955 he organized an inspection of Freifjorden; using echo sounding it was possible to survey the depth of the fjord. Afterwards he took contact with County Governor Olav Oksvik and the two started working towards implementing the plans.|$|E

5|$|From Leicester {{the march}} moved to Market Harborough. This {{was one of}} the least {{welcoming}} of all the overnight stops. No member of the local council greeted or visited the marchers, and they were forced to spend the night on the stone floor of an unfinished building (the <b>local</b> <b>press</b> later denied that this was so). On Saturday 24 October the marchers reached Northampton, arriving {{at the same time as}} the blind group.

5|$|George Burley {{took over}} from Redknapp in December 2005, though neither manager {{was unable to}} put {{together}} an effective promotion campaign and Southampton ended the season 12th in the Championship. Higginbotham rejected a new contract {{and as a result}} was placed on the transfer list in July 2006. He told the <b>local</b> <b>press</b> that he felt disrespected the way Southampton chairman Rupert Lowe had handled his contract – he had taken a pay cut to move from Derby, a 40% pay cut following relegation, and then the new contract offer was lower still than his current contract.|$|E
5|$|Hammond {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Gloucestershire in August 1920. Although his first four innings yielded only 27 runs, the <b>local</b> <b>press</b> saw enough to predict a great future for him. He spent the winter {{working on a}} farm on the Isle of Wight, then moved to Bristol {{for the start of}} the 1921 English cricket season. Playing only two first-class matches in 1921, both against the powerful Australian tourists, Hammond scored two runs in three innings, overwhelmed by fast bowler Jack Gregory. In between these games, Gloucestershire arranged his appointment as assistant coach at Clifton College, Bristol, where he worked on his batting technique with former county cricketers John Tunnicliffe and George Dennett.|$|E

While in Kansas as early as 2006, residents have suggested the Cairn Terrier as the state dog due to the breed's appearance as Toto in the film The Wizard of Oz. In 2012, Representative Ed Trimmer tabled a bill proposing the Cairn Terrier as a state symbol.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1860s, many {{counties}} in Pennsylvania were staunch {{supporters of the}} Democratic Party, while the newly {{elected president of the}} United States was the Republican Abraham Lincoln. When a large number of men were drafted from Columbia County, tensions led to raids and arrests in Columbia and neighboring counties. As early as 1862, the <b>local</b> <b>press</b> expressed outrage at a draft of 636 men, mostly mechanics and laborers. An 1863 law requiring all men from 20 to 45 years old to be drafted increased tensions further. On July 20 locals broke into the district draft office and stole the items inside. But besides this event, there was little active violence against officials of the 1863 draft.|$|E
