25|$|However, , {{there was}} still a {{significant}} amount of policy-driven distortion in global agricultural product prices. The three agricultural products with the greatest amount of trade distortion were sugar, milk and rice, mainly due to taxation.

Since the 1980s, policy-driven distortions have seen a greater decrease among livestock products than crops during the worldwide reforms in agricultural policy. Despite this progress, certain crops, such as cotton, still see subsidies in developed countries artificially deflating global prices, causing hardship in developing countries with non-subsidized farmers. Unprocessed commodities (i.e. corn, soybeans, cows) are generally graded to indicate quality. The quality affects the price the producer receives.

The model predicts that the higher the level of rigidity in wages and hours the lower are GDP per capita, employment, part-time work and hours worked, but the higher is GDP per hour. In addition, it predicts that a country {{with a high level of}} rigidity in wages and hours and a high level <b>of</b> income <b>taxation</b> has higher GDP per hour and lower GDP per capita, employment and part-time work than a country with less rigidity and a <b>lower</b> level <b>of</b> <b>taxation.</b> This is due mostly to a <b>lower</b> level <b>of</b> employment.

With second-best instruments, {{a higher level of}} income redistribution calls for a <b>lower</b> level <b>of</b> Pigouvian <b>taxation.</b> More redistributionimplies that tax collection via the income tax creates higher distortions, which in turn makes revenues from Pigouvian taxation more valuable.

The paper also shows that the relation between levels of redistribution and Pigouvian taxation is reversed in first-best.

40|$|Abstract: In recent years, {{there has}} been a growing {{recognition}} that some employers illegitimately under-declare employees’ salaries by paying an undeclared (‘envelope’) wage in addition to their official declared salary. The aim {{of this paper is to}} evaluate critically the competing perspectives that variously explain the cross-national variations in the propensity of employ-ers to under-declare wages to be: simply a legacy of under-development (modernisation perspective); due to high taxes, state corruption and burdensome regulations and controls (neo-liberal perspective), or a result of inadequate state intervention in work and welfare arrangements which leaves workers less than fully protected (structuralist perspective). Reporting the re-sults of a 2007 Eurobarometer involving 26, 659 face-to-face interviews across the 27 member states of the European Union (EU- 27) to evaluate the prevalence, size and nature of envelope wage arrangements across the EU- 27, this exploratory study reveals that envelope wages are more common, larger and more likely to be for regular work in poorer, more corrupt and less equal nations with <b>lower</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>taxation,</b> state intervention in the labor market, social protection and redistribution via so-cial transfers.

40|$|This paper proposes {{and tests}} a {{mechanism}} {{through which the}} natural resource curse can operate. I posit that, {{in the presence of}} high natural resource rents, leaders <b>lower</b> the burden <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> on citizens {{in order to reduce the}} demand for democratic accountability. The theory is tested using micro-level data from public opinion surveys across 15 sub-Saharan countries, in addition to country-level data on natural resource rents, taxation and election proximity. It is found that an increase in natural resource rents decreases perceived tax enforcement, which in turn reduces the demand for regular, open and honest elections. Results are robust to alternative specifications. A supplementary analysis reveals that, consistent with the two-period model proposed, the effects are more acute closer to national elections. The findings support political-economy explanations of how natural resources affect economies, in which resource rents are purported to influence the decisions of the political elite through increased returns to staying in power.

The UK tax system requires individuals to pay 50% tax on all income above £150,000. Other taxes, such as Capital Gains Tax, have lower rates.

40|$|This paper aims {{to examine}} the nexus between {{globalization}} and the nation-state, which has been heatedly discussed {{since the end of}} the 1990 's, and present a desirable image of the role of the nation-state in an age of globalization. As will be explained later, globalization, like the two sides of a coin, has brought about positive and negative outcomes. On the positive side, there has been an increase of wealth worldwide through innovations in information, digital, and communication technologies, as well as the enhancement of freedom and women's rights. Yet, globalization has also given birth to potential, and uncertain, dangers such as socio-political frictions and instability caused by social inequality within, and among, nations. The authors conclude by suggesting that globalization poses a threat, one that is not, as has often been argued, to the state itself, but rather to democracy. Since the 1990 s, the processes associated with surplus accumulation throughout the world ultimately have expedited the trend toward <b>lower</b> costs <b>of</b> labor, and <b>lower</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> and regulation, and have become a direct cause for the conversion of welfare states to competitive states keen to induce capital. This situation has become a grave factor, forcing national governments to evade their responsibilities for society's weakness. By raising a critical question as to whether this neo-liberal globalization is what we all have really wished for, the authors argue that the nation-states, presently standing at the crossroads of the 21 st century, need to recapture their roles as welfare states, transforming the contemporary system of capitalism so that the Keynesian system of mixed economy can be prosperous on a worldwide scale...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} democracy and natural resource rents. In our political economy model we allow for two dimensions of democracy: electoral competition and checks and balances. Under certain conditions politicians find it more effective to provide private patronage rather than public goods. Public scrutiny is generally weaker in countries with high natural resource rents because <b>of</b> <b>lower</b> <b>taxation,</b> and such patronage politics are thus more likely. Using a global panel data set we test these predictions and find that in developing countries the combination of high natural resource rents and open democratic systems has been growth reducing. However, our results also show that checks and balances can offset this adverse effect. We suggest that resource rich economies need a distinctive form of democracy, with more emphasis on checks and balances rather than on electoral competition...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to advance a new {{explanation}} for cross-country variations in the participation of small businesses in the informal economy. Drawing upon institutional theory, it proposes that the greater the asymmetry between the codified laws and regulations of formal institutions (state morality) and the unwritten socially shared rules of informal institutions (civic morality), the greater is the propensity of small businesses to participate in the informal economy. To analyse this, the extent to which small businesses evade payroll taxes by paying employees an undeclared (envelope) wage in addition to their official declared salary is analysed. Design/methodology/approach – To evaluate this, data are reported from a 2013 Eurobarometer survey involving 5, 174 face-to-face interviews with employees in small businesses across the 28 member states of the European Union (EU- 28). Findings – The finding is that small businesses display a greater propensity to engage in this informal wage practice in countries where there is a higher degree of asymmetry between the codified laws and regulations of formal institutions (state morality) and the unwritten socially shared rules of informal institutions (civic morality). A multi-level logistic regression analysis reveals these to be countries which have <b>lower</b> qualities <b>of</b> governance, <b>lower</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> and intervention in the labour market and less effective social transfer systems. Research limitations/implications – The major limitation of this study is that it has only examined whether employees in small businesses receive informal wages. Future cross-country surveys should analyse a wider range of ways in which small businesses participate in the informal economy such as under-reporting turnover. Originality/value – This is the first known analysis of cross-country variations in the participation of small businesses in the informal economy...|$|R
