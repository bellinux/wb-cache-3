The wall of arbitrary cross-section consists of several (actually three) elastic, anisotropic layers.

This system is coupled with the Navier–Stokes equations through the stress and velocity, i. e. dynamic and kinematic conditions at the interior surface of the wall. Explicit formulas are deduced for the effective rigidity tensor of the wall in two natural cases.

40|$|Experimental {{data are}} {{presented}} which show that hypervelocity impact spallation and penetration failures {{of a single}} solid aluminum plate and of a solid aluminum plate spaced a distance behind a Whipple meteor bumper may be retarded by replacing the solid aluminum plate with a laminated plate. Four sets of experiments were conducted. The first set of experiments was conducted with projectile mass and velocity held constant and with polycarbonate cylinders impacted into single plates of different construction. The second set of experiments was done with single plates of various construction and aluminum spherical projectiles of similar mass but different velocities. These two experiments showed that a laminated plate of aluminum and polycarbonate or aluminum and methyl methacrylate could prevent spallation and penetration failures with a lower areal density than either an all-aluminum laminated plate or a solid aluminum plate. The aluminum laminated plate was in turn superior to the solid aluminum plate in resisting spallation and penetration failures. In addition, through an example of 6061 -T 6 aluminum and methyl methacrylate, it is shown that a laminated structure ballistically superior to its parent materials may be built.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to assess the fire {{performance}} of <b>laminated</b> <b>wall</b> panels comprised of medium density fibreboard (MDF) core sandwiched between two outer layers of a thin sheet Arborite laminates. Both fire retarded (FR) and non-fire-retarded (NFR) versions of each material were tested by themselves and also in various laminated combinations. In this research, the hypothesis is that the fire performance of each individual material will be mirrored layer by layer in the properties of the overall assembly. Important questions then included, how many of the layers need to contain fire retardant additives to achieve a target performance for the panel assembly? In addition, the effect of the glue used in the construction of the panel was unknown, but it was hypothesized that due to the flammability of most glues, the adhesives have a significant impact on the requirement for FR additives in each layer. The main apparatus used in the investigation is a Cone Calorimeter. Testing followed the ASTM E- 1345 protocol, so the time to ignition, mass loss rates, heat release rates (HRR) during open flaming periods, peak heat release rates and time to reach peak heat release rate were measured. These parameters were used to assess the relative fire performance of each base material and assembly, thus deducing the efficacy of the fire retardant additives in each combination. The panel assembly selected for the present study is typical of laminated MDF panels used as elevator cab lining materials. All materials were obtained from Elevator Cab Renovations (ECR), the industrial partner for much of this work. Both front and backer materials were made by Arborite and both regular NFR and FR versions of each were used. Similarly NFR and FR core MDF specimens were used in custom assembled test panels glued together using Permagrip PG 107, a common glue in the industry. In total seven different individual materials, eight unglued panel assemblies and eight fully assembled and glued laminated panels were tested for this research. In most cases, three repeat tests were run for each specimen to determine repeatability and, where necessary, allowing averaging to reduce overall variability in the results. Key performance indicators were determined using the results from each test and the relationships between various combinations of samples were examined. A recommendation is presented that FR additives should be used in the front and core sections of the panel assembly. This is based on the results across all tests and the observations made regarding the effectiveness of FR additives to each individual material, as well as to the panel assembly. It was also concluded that there is no strong evidence to demonstrate that the use of NFR backer materials significantly reduces the fire performance characteristics of the panel assembly when FR additives are used in the other two layers. Finally, there is strong evidence that the glue in a laminated assembly does lead to increased values of measured HRR, and also has a discernible effect on the rate of Carbon Monoxide (CO) production from the assembly...|$|R

40|$|Composite {{materials}} {{can be used}} to upgrade the load-carrying capacities of unreinforced masonry walls. The strength of the upgraded wall, however, is often limited by failure that occurs near the bottom of a wall due to a low capacity for load transfer between the wall and the foundation. The present paper provides information on an experimental investigation of a composite anchoring system on unreinforced concrete masonry walls. This system provides high-capacity load transfer between the fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) <b>laminate</b> retrofitted <b>wall</b> and the foundation. Six masonry wall-concrete footing assemblages were built, strengthened with FRP laminates, and tested. On all walls, a composite anchoring system provided the only connection between concrete foundation and masonry wall. Three walls (1219 mm x 1219 mm) had composite laminate applied in edge strips to both faces and were subjected to in-plane shear and a 22. 24 kN axial load. The capacity of these walls reached more than 120 kN (lateral load) before failure, which resulted from extensive cracking of the masonry units. The other three walls (406 mm x 1016 mm) had the tension surface fully covered with CFRP laminate and were tested in tension (bending) reaching a maximum load of 32 kN before failing due to masonry unit crushing. In each loading case, the anchoring system provided sufficient strength allowing the masonry units to fail before the CFRP laminate or composite anchors failed. The results of this research reveal that strength gains due to FRP laminate upgrades on unreinforced concrete masonry walls can be fully realized {{through the use of a}} composite anchoring system. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract]: Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) is {{made from}} {{dimensional}} lumber, laminated in layers with the grain in each layer placed orthogonal to the layer before it. The resultant product is not dissimilar to thick plywood. CLT {{is made from}} timber, which is an environmentally attractive option {{in comparison to the}} reinforced concrete or steel structures which dominate the multistorey building market sector. Timber is {{one of the very few}} sustainable carbon neutral building materials available. New technology such as advanced Building Information Modeling (BIM) software and high accuracy CNC machinery are giving CLT the advantage over traditional on-site construction methods. Prefabrication is the key to CLT’s improved construction time-frames, far greater quality control, than on-site construction can deliver. There are no CLT manufacturers currently producing in Australia. Hyne and Son Pty Ltd. is a leading Australian manufacturer and distributor of engineered, structural and decorative softwood products to the building industry. This project forms part of an initial investigation into cross <b>laminated</b> timber <b>wall</b> panels, manufactured from non-structural low grade pine. Initially, the investigations will be directed solely at the low-rise multistorey residential market sector, which Hyne already services with other products.

Considerations such as fire, and deflection under load are also made. Results from initial investigations show that, even though fabricated from low grade structural timber, CLT has enormous axial capacity.

The studied curtain wall, spanning floor to floor, {{consisted of a}} laminated glass panel, a continuous bead of structural silicone sealant, a split screw spline frame and four rigid brackets. Firstly, a linear elastic FE-model (M 01) is presented to investigate dynamic stresses and deflections due to explosion, by taking into account geometrical nonlinearities. Since, in similar glazing systems, {{it is important to}} take into account the possible cracking of glass lites, a second model (M 02), calibrated to previous experimental data, is proposed. In it, glass behaves as a brittle-elastic material, whereas an elastoplastic characteristic curve is assumed for mullions. As a result, the design explosion seriously affects the main components of the curtain wall, especially the bead of silicone. To address these criticalities, additional viscoelastic (VE) devices are installed at the frame corners (M 03). Their effectiveness explains the additional deformability provided to the conventional curtain wall, as well as the obvious dissipation of the incoming energy due to blast loading. Structural and energy capabilities provided by devices are highlighted by means of numerical simulations...|$|R

Facades and floor slabs were identified as the primary contributors to building cost and environmental impacts and therefore the easiest targets for optimization. The primary method for optimizing facades is replacing curtain wall with solid cross <b>laminated</b> timber (CLT) <b>walls,</b> this method runs counter to developer driven standards of fully glazed facades making short term adoption of this strategy unlikely without major shifts in building developer and owner expectations.

Three different types of braided structure were produced namely (1) simple braids made of polyester yarns, (2) braids made of polyester yarns and axially reinforced with glass fibres and (3) braids made of polyester yarns and axially reinforced with carbon fibres. Three masonry wall specimens were built with traditional perforated clay bricks, embedding these braided structures within the mortar paste in specific mesh like configuration. Besides that, another <b>wall</b> containing glass/epoxy <b>laminates</b> was also fabricated in order to compare the performance of braided structures with the commonly used glass/epoxy <b>laminates.</b> The masonry <b>wall</b> specimens were characterized for flexural properties using four point load configuration and the experimental {{results showed that the}} best ductile behaviour was achieved with the braided structure having carbon fibre core.

Moreover, the present research also demonstrates that the ductility of these novel materials can be further enhanced through use of a hybrid core containing a mixture of glass and carbon fibres. According to the experimental results, a hybrid core containing 25 % glass and 75 % carbon fibre results in better mechanical behaviour than 100 % carbon core and therefore, can be advantageously used for strengthening of masonry walls...|$|R

Compared to single family houses, trailers were asso-ciated with more dampness, consequently a significant increased prevalence of asthma (AOR 1. 5 with 95 % confident interval (CI) 1. 0 – 2. 3), rhinitis (AOR 1. 4, 95 % CI 1. 0 – 2. 0) and hay fever (AOR 1. 5, 95 % CI 1. 1 – 2. 1). Central air-conditioning system, which re-circulates indoor air, was associated with less damp-ness problems. However, an increment trend of allergic symptoms was found in homes with air-conditioning system, especially for rhinitis (AOR 1. 6, 95 % CI 1. 1 – 2. 2). Carpet as floor covering and <b>laminated</b> panel as <b>wall</b> covering were associated with rhinitis (AOR 1. 6, 95 % CI 1. 0 – 2. 5) and wheez...|$|R
40|$|Lubambe Copper Mine {{is located}} in Chililabombwe Zambia and is a joint copper mining venture with three {{partners}} that include African Rainbow Minerals 40 Vale 40 and the Government of Zambia 20. The current mining method utilises Longitudinal Room and Pillar Mining LRP on 70 m long panels strike length. However these long panels have resulted in unprecedented levels of dilution mainly from the collapse of hanging <b>wall</b> <b>laminated</b> ore shale OS 2 leading to reduced recoveries. Observations made underground show high variability in geological and geotechnical conditions of the rock mass with factors such as weathering on joints lamina spaced joints and stress changes induced by mining all contributing to weakening and early collapse of the hanging wall. Therefore a study was undertaken to establish the optimal stope strike length of steep ore bodies at Lubambe. The exercise involved the use of Faro Laser Scanner every four stope rings blasted with time when the scan was performed noted. The spatial coherence of lasers makes them ideal measuring tools in situations where measurements {{need to be taken}} in inaccessible areas. Recent advances in laser scanning coupled with the exponential increase in processing power have greatly improved the methods used to estimate stope tonnages extracted from massive inaccessible stopes. The collected data was then used to construct digital three dimensional models of the stope contents. Sections were cut every metre with deformations taken and analysed with respect to time. Deformation rates from the hanging wall was reducing from 0. 14 thr to 0. 07 thr between rings 1 to 8. This reduction was as a result of slot blasting that involved drilling and blasting a number of holes at the same time. Between rings 8 to 25 deformation was constant averaging 0. 28 thr and between rings 26 and 28 a sharp increase in deformation rate was experienced from as low as 0. 16 thr to 6. 33 thr. This sharp increase defines the optimal stope length as 50 m beyond which there is excessive levels of dilution mainly from the hanging wall...|$|R
