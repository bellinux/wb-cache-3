30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{core spun yarn}} used to impart {{elasticity}} to fabrics and their usage has recently been increasing. Most significantly, {{in the production of}} denim fabrics when the core spun yarn and the paper yarn are used properly as weft, it is found that the disadvantages of the paper denim fabric’s heaviness, roughness, and wrinkles caused by <b>low</b> <b>stretchability,</b> can be greatly improved.|$|E
40|$|Fabrication of {{unconventional}} {{energy storage}} devices with high stretchability and performance is challenging, but critical to practical operations of fully power-independent stretchable electronics. While supercapacitors represent a promising candidate for unconventional energy-storage devices, existing stretchable supercapacitors {{are limited by}} their <b>low</b> <b>stretchability,</b> complicated fabrication process, and high cost. Here, we report a simple and low-cost method to fabricate extremely stretchable and high-performance electrodes for supercapacitors based on new crumpled-graphene papers. Electrolyte-mediated-graphene paper bonded on a compliant substrate can be crumpled into self-organized patterns by harnessing mechanical instabilities in the graphene paper. As the substrate is stretched, the crumpled patterns unfold, maintaining high reliability of the graphene paper under multiple cycles of large deformation. Supercapacitor electrodes based on the crumpled graphene papers exhibit a unique combination of high stretchability (e. g., linear strain ~ 300 %, areal strain ~ 800 %), high electrochemical performance (e. g., specific capacitance ~ 196 F g[superscript − 1]), and high reliability (e. g., over 1000 stretch/relax cycles). An all-solid-state supercapacitor capable of large deformation is further fabricated to demonstrate practical applications of the crumpled-graphene-paper electrodes. Our method and design open {{a wide range of}} opportunities for manufacturing future energy-storage devices with desired deformability together with high performance. United States.

30|$|Since the denim {{fabric is}} stiff {{and the color}} of indigo blue fades over time, without an {{application}} of finishing methods by either conventional industrial washing or new laser fading, {{it is not easy to}} achieve high quality denim wear (Juciene et al. 2006; Kan and Wong 2011; Khedher et al. 2011). In the world today, the premium denim fabric’s dye has been known as a dye that gradually and slightly fades with repeated washings and with a dehydration process. Also, there is need for comfort with softer touch, a lighter weight, and stretch to this premium fabric. With this trend, recently, there has been a development of functional denim fabrics. For example, in Japan in 2015, a paper denim fabric has been developed and used as the premium denim fabric (Park and Lee 2016). This denim fabric has received attention as it introduces the need for lightweight with improved comfort by using a cotton yarn (indigo rope-dyeing) as the warp, and the Japanese paper yarn as the weft. The Japanese paper denim fabric is proper for denim jean pants and/or shirts worn in warm summer months. However, problems exist with wrinkles due to the fabric’s high rigidity and <b>low</b> <b>stretchability</b> of the paper yarn. In addition, there are consumers who want to wear denim jean pants or denim shirts, but they have a tendency to avoid these denim products due to skin allergies that are caused by a reaction to a chemical dye in the denim fabric.|$|E
30|$|To acquire {{electrical}} conductivity, conducting polymers {{and carbon}} series semiconductor materials {{are often used}} as functional elements in the fabrication of membrane. Polyaniline (PANI) {{is a kind of}} conductive polymer with high conductivity and is easily to be polymerized. However, the strong polarity, which induces high conductivity, leads to poor elasticity of PANI [16]. Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), as one of the high-elasticity materials, is characterized with high elasticity, low-temperature flexibility, and abrasion resistance [17]. The combination of TPU and PANI can make up the disadvantage of PANI, and the strong polarity of PANI makes efforts to combination. Besides, the TPU membrane obtained by electrospinning is of high elasticity, high <b>stretchability,</b> <b>low</b> cost, and light weight. In situ polymerization exhibits a good way to combine TPU membrane and PANI together. As for flexible strain sensor and stretchable conductor, which could be applied in wearable electronic devices, elasticity and conductivity are essential, so we choose TPU and PANI as raw materials to fabricate nanofibrous composites. In this paper, highly stretchable and electrically conductive TPU nanofibrous membrane based on electrospinning for flexible strain sensor and stretchable conductor has been fabricated via post-processing strategies. The PANI/TPU composite sensor could sustain a maximum tension of 165 %, and the conductivity of our strain sensor can be calculated to be about 7.5 [*]×[*] 10 − 3  S cm− 1. Meanwhile, the composite displays good stability and durability. Moreover, the composite could be applied to various non-flat working environments and could maintain almost good conductivity at different operating temperatures. This work provides a facile operating and low-cost method to fabricate highly stretchable and electrically conductive nanofibrous membranes, which have potential applications in flexible strain sensors and stretchable conductors for wearable devices.|$|R
