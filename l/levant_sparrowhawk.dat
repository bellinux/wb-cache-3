40|$|Aims Different {{aspects of}} soaring-bird {{migration}} {{are influenced by}} weather. However, the relationship between weather and the onset of soaring-bird migration, particularly in autumn, is not clear. Although long-term migration counts are often unavailable near the breeding areas of many soaring birds in the western Palaearctic, soaring-bird migration has been systematically monitored in Israel, a region where populations from large geographical areas converge. This study tests several fundamental hypotheses regarding the onset of migration and explores the connection between weather, migration onset and arrival at a distant site. Location Globally gridded meteorological data from the breeding areas in north-eastern Europe were used as predictive variables {{in relation to the}} arrival of soaring migrants in Israel. Methods Inverse modelling was used to study the temporal and spatial influence of weather on initiation of migration based on autumn soaring-bird migration counts in Israel. Numerous combinations of migration duration and temporal influence of meteorological variables (temperature, sea-level pressure and precipitable water) were tested with different models for meteorological sensitivity. Results The day of arrival in Israel of white storks, honey buzzards, <b>Levant</b> <b>sparrowhawks</b> and lesser spotted eagles was significantly and strongly related to meteorological conditions in the breeding area days or even weeks before arrival in Israel. The cumulative number of days or cumulative value above or below a meteorological threshold performed significantly better than other models tested. Models provided reliable estimates of migration duration for each species. Main conclusions The meteorological triggers of migration at the breeding grounds differed between species and were related to deteriorating living conditions and deteriorating migratory flight conditions. Soaring birds are sensitive to meteorological triggers at the same period every year and their temporal response to weather appears to be constrained by their annual routine...|$|R

50|$|First {{described}} by Nikolai Alekseevich Severtzov in 1850, the <b>Levant</b> <b>sparrowhawk</b> {{is a small}} bird of prey in the genus Accipiter. It is sometimes {{considered to be a}} subspecies of the shikra, though it differs in measurements, proportions and plumage, and breeds contiguously with the latter (typically considered a reliable indicator of speciation) over at least part of its range. Along with the shikra, the Chinese sparrowhawk and the Nicobar sparrowhawk, it makes up a complex species group. It is known to have hybridised with the shikra and the Eurasian sparrowhawk. Despite its extensive range, it has no subspecies.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Levant</b> <b>sparrowhawk</b> breeds from mid-May through August. The pair is {{territorial}} while breeding, often performing high-circling aerial displays. The female {{is thought}} to make the nest. She builds a new one every year, a small structure of twigs on a branch or in a fork of a broad-leaved tree. The nest tree is often near running water, typically in open woodland, on a forest edge, or in an isolated clump of trees. The nest, which measures up to 30 cm across and 15 cm deep, is lined with green leaves. Most nests are located between 5 - 10 m above the ground, {{but they have been}} found as low as 4 m and as high as 20 m.|$|E

Moreover, it provides shelter for than 80 species of birds, such as 10 types of rare bird species including the eastern imperial eagle, golden eagle, <b>Levant</b> <b>sparrowhawk</b> and the lanner falcon,which indicates the ornithological importance of the area. One of the rare birds found in the park is the shore lark (Eremophilla alpestris), found in the alpine meadows, and the great grey shrike (Lanius excubitor), which migrates in the summer from Africa. The dense and mature forests of the area host eight types of woodpecker, including the white-backed, the middle spotted, the lesser spotted and the black woodpecker.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Levant</b> <b>sparrowhawk</b> (Accipiter brevipes) {{is a small}} bird of prey. It {{measures}} 32 - 38 cm {{in length}} with a wingspan of 65 - 75 cm.

The adult male is blue-grey above, with dark wingtips, and barred reddish below.The adult female is slate-grey above with darkish wingtips. She is barred reddish brown below, and may show a dark throat line. The juvenile is dark brown above and has dark-streaked underparts. It shows a dark throat line. It breeds in forests from Greece and the Balkans east to southern Russia. It is migratory, wintering from Egypt across to southwestern Iran. It will migrate in large flocks, unlike the more widespread Eurasian sparrowhawk.|$|E
5000|$|To {{many other}} {{raptorial}} birds, the northern goshawk is more significant as a predatory threat than as competition. The northern goshawk {{is one of}} the most dangerous species to other raptors, especially to those considerably smaller than itself. In many cases, raptors of any age from nestlings to adults are taken around their nests but free-flying raptors too are readily taken or ambushed at a perch. One example is a study from northern England, the common kestrels (Falco tinnunculus), which average about 184 g, recorded as prey at goshawk nests (mainly in March and April) numbered 139, a larger number than kestrels recorded alive in the spring in the same area. In the Veluwe province of the Netherlands, the percentage of nest of European honey buzzards (Pernis apivorus), weighing on average 760 g, predated by goshawks increased from a little as 7.7% in 1981-1990 to 33% in 2000-2004. As their habitat preferences may overlap with goshawks, all other Accipiters encountered may be predated in multiple cases, including the 238 g Eurasian sparrowhawk, the 188 g <b>levant</b> <b>sparrowhawk</b> (Accipiter brevipes), the 136 g sharp-shinned hawk, the 122 g Japanese sparrowhawk (Accipiter gularis) and the 440 g Cooper's hawk.|$|E
5000|$|The bird life of {{the region}} is quite rich. Most of these bird species are widely spread in the country. Some of these {{typically}} inhabit the fields - partridge (Perdix perdix), quail (Coturnix coturnix), field-lark (Alauda arvensis), yellow wagtail (Motacilla flava), grey rook (Corvus corone), blue crow (Coracias garrulus), bee-eater (Merops apiaster), others inhabitants of the forests - nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos), wood-lark (Lullula arborea), garden warbler (Sylvia atricapilla), long-eared owl (Asio otus), tawny owl (Strix aluco). There are also several birds which inhabit the area that {{are listed in the}} Bulgaria section of the IUCN Red List. These include, (but are not limited to), black stork (Ciconia nigra), pygmy cormorant (Microcarbo pygmeus), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), <b>Levant</b> <b>sparrowhawk</b> (Accipiter brevipes) and the lesser spotted eagle (Aquila pomarina). The area is home to many reptiles, among which feature the great crested newt (Triturus cristatus),Interestingly, a common occurrence is for these animals to come into contact with the local people, either directly or indirectly. For example, badgers, weasels, and beech martens are regularly blamed for attacking local livestock, (mostly chicken and small fowl). Indeed, this is a major problem in some instances as jackals, for example, may wander into the village and attack sheep, livestock, and sometimes even guard dogs. For this reason most livestock owners tend to lock up their animals during the night ...|$|E

40|$|Counts of {{migrating}} raptors at Batumi, Georgia, {{revealed the}} eastern Black Sea coast to form {{one of the}} most important bottlenecks for raptor migration during autumn in the Eurasian-African migration system.

We compare the observed abundance of each species to estimates of the presumed source populations in European Russia. Counts of most species involved only a limited subset of these source populations, except for European Honey-buzzard and Lesser Spotted Eagle, which were more numerous than predicted. This could be due to inaccurate population estimates or because birds from NE Europe or W Asia are also using this migration route...|$|E
40|$|Monitoring raptors along {{migration}} corridors {{can be used}} {{to assess}} changes in population size. The Balkan population of the endangered Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus is declining rapidly, but no trend information exists of the larger adjacent population in western Turkey. In September 2013, we explored 13 localities around the gulf of Iskenderun, southern Turkey, to establish whether long-term migration monitoring would be possible in the area. We found that the small hills north of the gulf of Iskenderun were consistently better for observing migration than locations at the Belen pass, southeast of the gulf. Long-term raptor monitoring should be established at three points north of the gulf of Iskenderun near the villages of Sarimazi and Selimiye. If attended by 2 – 3 observers mid August–mid October, these observation points would likely allow monitoring of the majority of Egyptian Vultures migrating around the eastern coast of the Mediterranean sea. Summing observations at the 13 localities, we counted 552 Egyptian Vultures with a peak between 10 and 24 September. In addition, we observed> 50 000 individuals of 24 other raptor species, with Lesser Spotted Eagle, <b>Levant</b> <b>Sparrowhawk,</b> European Honey Buzzard, and Short-toed Snake Eagle being the most common...|$|E
