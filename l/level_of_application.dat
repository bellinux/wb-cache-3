The method used in selection in the crop improvement was based on values of their genetic parameters. Bisma {{is one of the}} maize varieties that has a broad genetic background. New maize varieties {{could be obtained}} by improving their population through selection under different environmental conditions. Genetic parameter value were estimated by conducting an experiment under NCD II crossing at Bogor. Twenty seven sets, which were developed from three females and three males of S 1 as parents of each set, were evaluated under three different fertilization schemes. Results of the experiment showed that the additive genetic variance was significantly different from zero, and so among the different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> fertilizer <b>applications.</b> The dominant variances was not significant under the three different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> fertilization <b>applications.</b> The additive genetic variance was lower under the low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> fertilizer <b>application</b> than that on the higher <b>level</b> <b>of</b> fertilization <b>application.</b> This might be due to the scale effect. To reduce effect of scale, the data were transformed by dividing the grand mean value. After the data transformation, the genetic variance under the low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> fertilizer <b>application</b> tended to be greater than that under the higher <b>level</b> <b>of</b> fertilizer <b>application.</b> There was a tendency that population improvement of Bisma variety could be achieved better under lower <b>level</b> <b>of</b> fertilizer <b>applications</b> than under the higher ones...|$|R

These principles are considered important components of exemplary middle school programs. ^ Specific research questions addressed were: (1) To what degree are the eighteen middle school principles being applied to middle schools in the state of Nebraska and in randomly sampled middle schools throughout the United States? (2) Are there significant differences in the application of the eighteen middle school principles in middle schools in Nebraska as compared to application of these principles in randomly sampled middle schools throughout the United States? (3) Among middle schools throughout the United States, are there differences in the application of middle school principles in 1986 as compared to 1980 ? (4) Are there differences in the findings among selected studies related to the application of middle school principles?^ A questionnaire survey instrument measured the application of eighteen middle school principles both in the Nebraska population and in a national sample of middle schools. Survey forms were returned by 21 of 22 (95. 45 percent) principals in Nebraska and from 117 of 150 (78 percent) principals of the national sample. ^ Findings and conclusions were: (1) Nebraska middle schools reported a slightly lower <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> (48. 48 percent) of the eighteen middle school principles when compared to the 1986 national <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> of 51. 51 percent.

40|$|Interactive {{effect of}} {{inorganic}} fertilizer and sewage sludge on nitrogen nutrition {{and growth of}} wheat was studied. Nitrogen was applied as 15 N-labelled (NH 4) 2 SO 4 at 0, 50, 150, and 300 mg pot 1 in all possible combinations with 0, 16, 24, 32, and 64 g pot 1 sewage sludge (SS). Fertilizer N had no {{significant effect on the}} dry weight of roots. The above-ground plant components responded positively to the application of both fertilizer N and SS. The positive effect increased with the rate of application. In absence of SS, grain yield increased from 4. 8 g pot 1 in the control to 10. 6 g pot 1 at the highest level of fertilizer N. Likewise, the increase in grain yield due to different treatments ranged between 97 and 233 % as compared to 23. 3 and 82. 5 % recorded for straw component. The trends in N content of different plant components were fairly similar to those observed for dry matter yield and a significant correlation was observed between two parameters. Combination of both treatments at highest rate resulted in 127 % increase in the total N yield of the plants. The contribution of N fertilizer to the total N content of the whole plant and its components remained fairly low and ranged between 11 and 45 % in different treatments. The percent fertilizer N uptake (%FNU) varied from 22. 6 % at the highest <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> in the absence of sludge to 79. 4 % at the lowest <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> and in the presence of highest amount of SS.
