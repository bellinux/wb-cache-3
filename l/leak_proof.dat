Our most technically substantial result is a Ω(n) lower bound on the UAM complexity of the NP-complete set-intersection function; the proof uses information complexity arguments in a new, indirect way and overcomes the “zero-information barrier” described above.

40|$|Göös, Pitassi and Watson (ITCS, 2015) have {{recently}} introduced {{the notion of}} Zero-Information Arthur-Merlin Protocols (ZAM). In this model, which {{can be viewed as}} a private version of the standard Arthur-Merlin communication complexity game, Alice and Bob are holding a pair of inputs x and y respectively, and Merlin, the prover, attempts to convince them that some public function f evaluates to 1 on (x, y).

In this paper, we relate this new notion to the well-studied model of Private Simultane-ous Messages (PSM) that was originally suggested by Feige, Naor and Kilian (STOC, 1994). Roughly speaking, we show that the randomness complexity of ZAM corresponds to the com-munication complexity of PSM, and that the communication complexity of ZAM corresponds to the randomness complexity of PSM. This relation works in both directions where different vari-ants of PSM are being used. As a secondary contribution, we reveal new connections between different variants of PSM protocols which we believe to be of independent interest. Our results give rise to better ZAM protocols based on existing PSM protocols, and to better protocols for conditional disclosure of secrets (a variant of PSM) from existing ZAMs. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{consistent}} query protocol (CQP) {{allows a}} database owner {{to publish a}} very short string c which commits her and everybody else to a particular database D, so that any copy of the database can later be used to answer queries and give short proofs that the answers {{are consistent with the}} commitment c. Here commits means that there is at most one database D that anybody can find (in polynomial time) which is consistent with c. (Unlike in some previous work, this strong guarantee holds even for owners who try to cheat while creating c.) Efficient CQPs for membership and one-dimensional range queries are known [4, 11, 16]: given a query pair a,b ∈ IR, the server answers with all the keys in the database which lie in the interval [a, b] and a proof that the answer is correct. This paper explores CQPs for more general types of databases. We put forward a general technique for constructing CQPs for any type of query, assuming the existence of a data structure/algorithm with certain inherent robustness properties that we define (called a data robust algorithm). We illustrate our technique by constructing an efficient protocol for orthogonal range queries, where the database keys are points in R d and a query asks for all keys in a rectangle [a 1, b 1] × [...] . × [ad, bd]. Our data-robust algorithm is within a O(log N) factor of the best known standard data structure (a range tree, due to Bentley [2]). We modify our protocol so that it is also private, that is, the <b>proofs</b> <b>leak</b> no information about the database beyond the query answers. We show a generic modification to ensure privacy based on zero-knowledge proofs, and also give a new, more efficient protocol tailored to hash trees.

ABSTRACT Leakage from an object or component {{is a common}} and often underestimated problem which can generate inferior quality of the product, loss of energy and eventually generate economical consequences if the leakage becomes too large. There also exists an environmental hazard and health risk if a product or component is leaking substantial amounts of chemicals or metals. Therefore there are great profits to gain if a possibility to minimize the leakage exists. Nolek AB assembles instruments for finding leakage, leak detection, and measure leakage, leak testing. The company arranges educations for their customers, but hasn’t had any updated material for doing this. The aim of this master thesis is to produce a compendium that explains leak testing, <b>leak</b> detection and <b>proof</b> testing, to produce a PowerPoint-presentation and to inquire into theories for writing pedagogical papers. The target groups for the compendium are course leaders, newly employed personnel at Nolek and the company’s customers. Density is a relative concept {{and it is not}} possible to prove a leak which does not exist. The base for leak testing is the density demands, which has to clearly define the leakage’s greatest quantity that is allowed per time unit. The density demands must also tell which medium, which pressure and which temperature that is being used for the testing. The testing is being carried out with a suitable method according to the density demands by deciding whether the component is leaking more or less than the density demands. Theoretical knowledge about pressure, gas and currents are central for determining what an acceptable leakage is or to understand why a certain deflection is shown on the instrument. Proof testing is a test of the strength of a component or a product. There exists multiple regulations that has to be considered when proof testing. A course compendium is a pedagogical text. Different texts are being read in different ways and leaves different room for the reader’s own interpretations. A pedagogical text should leave less room for interpretations than a fiction text. The author of a pedagogical text has a pre-defined opinion of what the reader is going to achieve by reading the text. The pedagogical text is supposed to be descriptive and has to be structured on the basis of pedagogical demands in order to make facts and explanations simple and tangible for the reader. When the author is writing in a simple and concrete fashion and uses a lot of examples, the text can be sensed as understandable, personally profitable and significant for the receiver. The thoughts of the author are supposed to be conveyed to the reader at the same time as the reader are being stimulated to think even further unaided...|$|R

Ansys simulation is carried out to gain accurate and critical understanding of crimp forming process. Simulation of elastoplastic behavior of aluminum sheet is carried out with non-linear condition to investigate sheet metal crimping process. Maximum stress regions are identified. This can be improved by suitable curvature radius which is possible once FEM process is understood.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to Design Parameters for Shielded Metal Arc Welding to ensure no leak to occur during the process. To achieve the objective an attempt has been made to select importantwelding parameters like welding current, welding speed, root gap and position of electrode based on field expert’s suggestions, available literature and on scientific reasons. On the selected parameters, trails have been conducted as per Taguchi method and fixed the levels for the parameters. Further, for each parameter 3 different levels are fixed,. so that the experiment have become 4 parameters (factors) and each with 3 levels. Based on this, L 9 (34) Orthogonal Array (OA) experiments are conducted and results are obtained. The results have indicated that <b>leak</b> <b>proof</b> joints can be produced in few specificoperating conditions. Under these conditions effects of noise are nullified. The contribution of each parameter towards the leak is also estimated by ANOVA...|$|E
