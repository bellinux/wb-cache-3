This makes it very important to have accurate and time-efficient models for system planning. We have previously published measurement results for an indoor channel investigation from 2. 4 GHz to 24 GHz. We now propose a new combined E/H-plane 2 D ray tracing method. This method includes 2 D ray-tracing calculations from both horizontal and vertical sections (E/H-planes). The method predicts loss accurately for both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) paths at five frequency bands from 2. 4 GHz to 24 GHz.

50|$|Because {{the radio}} waves travel in narrow beams {{confined}} to a <b>line-of-sight</b> <b>path</b> from one antenna to the other, they don't interfere with other microwave equipment, so nearby microwave links can use the same frequencies, called frequency reuse. Antennas must be highly directional (high gain); these antennas are installed in elevated locations such as large radio towers {{in order to be}} able to transmit across long distances. Typical types of antenna used in radio relay link installations are parabolic antennas, dielectric lens, and horn-reflector antennas, which have a diameter of up to 4 meters. Highly directive antennas permit an economical use of the available frequency spectrum, despite long transmission distances.|$|E

Thus, there is a non-line-of-sight multipath propagation channel between base stations and users, describing how the signal is reflected at different obstacles on its way from the transmitter to the receiver.

40|$|Abstract- In sensor localization, {{ultrasound}} based distance measurements {{will have}} large errors if <b>line-of-sight</b> <b>paths</b> are blocked between pairwise sensors. Because these outliers, once mixed {{together with other}} correct distance measurements, are difficult for localization algorithms to identify, we propose to exclude the outliers in {{the first step of}} distance measurement. Although the distance between pairwise sensors measured by ultrasound can have multiple values due to the multipath effect, our experiments find that a sensor's incorrect position, estimated from the distance measurement along a reflected path instead of a straight line, is always mirrored to the sensor's correct position. Based on this phenomena, we propose to use mobile beacons to measure the distance between pairwise sensors from multiple perspectives and filter incorrect values through a statistical approach. Our performance evaluation shows that the proposed algorithm can achieve better localization results than previous approaches in an indoor environment where multipath effects cannot be avoided.

5000|$|Millimeter waves {{propagate}} {{solely by}} <b>line-of-sight</b> <b>paths,</b> {{they are not}} reflected by the ionosphere nor do they travel along the Earth as ground waves as lower frequency radio waves do. [...] At typical power densities they are blocked by building walls and suffer significant attenuation passing through foliage. [...] Absorption by atmospheric gases is a significant factor throughout the band and increases with frequency. However it is maximum at a few specific absorption lines, mainly those of oxygen at 60 GHz and water vapor at 24 GHz and 184 GHz. [...] At frequencies in the [...] "windows" [...] between these absorption peaks, millimeter waves have much less atmospheric attenuation and greater range, so many applications use these frequencies. Millimeter wavelengths are the same order of size as raindrops, so precipitation causes additional attenuation due to scattering (rain fade) as well as absorption. [...] The high free space loss and atmospheric absorption limits useful propagation to a few kilometers. Thus, they are useful for densely packed communications networks such as personal area networks that improve spectrum utilization through frequency reuse.|$|R

This information can be provided by a dedi-cated indoor location system. A consumer location system should be robust, safe, easy to set up, low cost, and should have a minimal infrastructure. In this paper, a step towards consumer location systems is taken by proposing an ultra-sonic positioning method that needs just a single compact base station to measure 3 D positions of mobile devices in a room. The method employs ultrasound time-of-flight tri-lateration to estimate device positions, using a base sta-tion containing an array of three ultrasound transducers. Five potential problems of the proposed method are iden-tified; the main problem being <b>line-of-sight</b> <b>path</b> occlusion.

40|$|This thesis studies {{iterative}} and recursive {{least squares}} algorithms for maximum-likelihood joint channel/data estimation. The proposed schemes use the sphere decoding algorithm for data detection, and short training sequences for an initial channel estimation. Three new algorithms were developed for block- and continuous-fading frequency flat MIMO channels. The {{effects on the}} algorithms' performance {{of the existence of}} spatially correlated fading and <b>line-of-sight</b> <b>paths</b> are also studied. The multi-user MIMO scenario were also considered, where temporal and spatial correlated interference is present. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the investigated schemes under realistic fading conditions. In {{the second part of the}} thesis, two new adaptive equalizers were proposed for time-varying and frequency selective DS-CDMA systems. The proposed equalizers consist of serially connected stages and detect users in an ordered manner. At each stage, only one user is detected. The equalizer filters and the order in which the users are extracted are updated in a recursive least squares manner, efficiently realized through time- and order-update recursions. The first algorithm does not use the code sequences while the second scheme exploits the RAKE receiver concept. The proposed algorithms exhibit improved bit error rate performance compared to existing adaptive DS-CDMA equalizers. ...|$|R

40|$|Indoor {{wireless}} LAN systems currently {{operate at}} ranges {{of up to}} 30 meters, with practical data rates of 10 Mbps. In order to achieve higher data rates, higher frequencies are under consideration. Smaller antennas are required at these frequencies, but path loss increases. To combat the large path loss and multipath, 24 GHz phased arrays are being considered. The advantage of a phased array {{is that it can}} form narrow beams to favored directions, and nulls to combat interference. A 24 GHz active antenna with a 5 -element patch array is demonstrated that includes an integrated GaAs MMIC power amplifier and low noise amplifier chip. Bias switching is used for changing from transmit to receive. The measured active gain is 31 dB in receive and 35 dB in transmit. The measured noise figure in receive is 3. 5 dB and the maximum output power in transmit is 22 dBm (158 mW). Indoor wireless channels are investigated at five different frequency bands. The understanding of the channel will help link budgeting and system planning for future wireless communication. An automatic testing system has been developed using remote control by LABVIEW. This increases testing efficiency and reduces near field interference from the operator. A combined E/H plane 2 -D ray-tracing method is proposed to predict the channel performance. This approach accurately predicts path loss for both <b>line-of-sight</b> and non-line-of-sight <b>paths.</b> It predicts the delay spread in <b>line-of-sight</b> <b>paths</b> well but fails for non-line-of-sight paths. This could be due to the ignorance of some higher order paths with small amplitudes but near random phases. In addition, a 3 -D simplified ray-tracing code is developed to for access point optimization and to predict human shadow effects. ...|$|R
