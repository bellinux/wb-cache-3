40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis {{research}} was on developing an assessment protocol which assists the structural engineer in visualizing the structural possibilities for multi-story industrial heritage constructed between 1910 and 1950. The protocol distinguishes seven assessment steps {{which can be used}} to (1) indicate the material and structural quality (2) visualize the structural design possibilities and (3) assess the structural safety. The systematic approach introduced by the protocol stimulates a faster and more efficient determination of the comprehensive capabilities of the concrete <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>frame.</b> The protocol is developed from the context of integrated designing, giving the structural engineer an independent role in the redevelopment process. The individual assessment steps [the historic assessment, the visual assessment, the technical assessment, evaluation, the preliminary assessment, the [refined] structural safety assessment and the strenghtening assessment] are provided with current knowledge and trends available for the assessment of existing reinforced concrete structures. These steps are subjected to constant change and development. The structural engineer is therefore encouraged to supplement the protocol with experience gained during projects, and with future developments. The engineer is recommended to follow the assessment steps as proposed by the protocol. In cases where this is not possible the engineer should use the protocol to formulate a targeted assessment strategy, which minimizes the influences of the obstructed process. The protocol will provide the information, but requires the motivation and capabilities of the engineer to come to the desired results. QUALITY The first four assessment steps are designed to assist the visualization of the structural and material quality. The steps are focussed in gathering a sufficient amount of information to prevent unexpected situations in the construction or execution phase. The engineer should be aware that in the design of new buildings the information produced on paper will be realized, whereas in the situation of redesigning existing buildings what is realized should be put on paper. The information that is needed to estimate the remaining life span and to perform the structural safety assessment can only be found insitu. In some situations also design information {{can be found in the}} original document, but the engineer should be aware that his information always brings a certain level of inaccuracy and uncertainty. The first assessment step is the historic assessment which helps the engineer to collect a sufficient amount of original documentation [architectural design, structural design, reinforcement design, foundation etc. ] to visualize the quality and characteristics of the load bearing system. The assessment step is substantiated by a historic database which informs the modern structural engineer about the material and structural characteristics of historic concrete. This concept is introduced to bridge the knowledge gap between past and present and eliminate possible risks occurring from this gap by visualizing the differences in material durability, and provide structural information to clarify the original documentation or when no original information is available to substantiate the making of assessment assumptions. The quality assessment of materials and structures is time consuming, expensive and difficult when performed into detail. The structural engineer is therefore challenged to formulate a targeted and efficient approach without compromising the desired information. To stimulate this process the protocol introduces at the end of the historic assessment a general strategy which helps to formulate the desired and required input and output regarding the visual and technical assessment. The visual assessment stimulates the engineer to visualize the structural and material quality in-situ, by proposing a visual inspection towards deterioration and the optical verification of the original drawings. The assessment V step also provides a description of the non-destructive measuring techniques which can either be used to verify certain forms of deterioration or to verify the test results found with the technical assessment. At the end of the visual assessment the engineer is granted the possibility to take concrete and steel samples for additional research to be performed in the laboratory to indicate, the mechanical properties, the cause of deterioration or to estimate future deterioration. The protocol provides an estimate of the required research pool, and the considerations which have to be taken into account when estimating the sample location. The technical assessment step provides the structural engineer with a general introduction on the different laboratory tests, and their specifications. The quality assessment is completed by introducing the evaluation step, which provides the structural engineer with the general methodology for reinforced concrete repair and protection. This methodology points out the importance for conservation, and a durable and compatible approach. The assessment step also provides a list with the general methods that can be used for repair and protection. DESIGN POSSIBILITIES The identification of the quality and the visualization of the structural design is the basic input of the preliminary assessment stage. This stage is focussed on generating structural redevelopment concepts based on a pragmatic approach, and from the context of integrated designing. This process stimulates the designer’s creativity in visualizing the structural possibilities with respect to functional change. The success of redevelopment seen from a structural perspective depends on the aspects of structural flexibility, the structural adaptability, the relation between building and user, and the standard redevelopment criteria [climate, day light entrance, emergency routing etc. ]. To stimulate the successful integration of these design aspects into the redevelopment, the engineer is advised to use a morphological overview. Such an overview gathers the different structural aspects and combines them with possible structural redevelopment alternatives. The overview facilitates the making of combinations, generating redevelopment concepts and to rerun the design steps in a later stadium of the process. As a last note, the preliminary assessment recommends the engineer to generate the structural concepts from the concept of durable and sustainable design. The sustainable perspective requires the engineer to design with an eye on the future, whereas a durable design minimizes the need for functional change in the future. STRUCTURAL SAFETY The safety assessment of existing structures is different than the safety assessment for new structures. The differences can be found in the required aspects of the limit state design, and the considerations towards the structural reliability, the fire safety and the capacity estimation. The [refined] structural safety assessment visualizes the options regarding these different subjects, and clarifies their influences. The assessment stage also gives a general introduction on the methodology influencing the in depth detailing of the calculations and their reflection onto the desired results. In some situations the functional requirements exceed the bearing capacity of the load bearing structure. In such a case strengthening could be an option to improve the chances on redevelopment. Therefore, as last assessments stage the strengthening assessment is introduced. This assessment step visualizes the methodology towards estimating the required strengthening in respect to the ultimate and serviceability limit state design, and gives a general introduction on the strengthening methods available on today’s market.

A structural thermal coupled non-linear {{analysis was used to}} predict locations, directions and propagation of cracks. A commercially available finite element code ANSYS was used to construct the model. It is shown that masonry walls under a concrete slab that is exposed to solar radiation can experience cracking, and that this cracking can be predicted based on the features of the wall i. e. whether the wall is <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> or <b>framed</b> and the presence of openings and lintels. The results were compared with the information obtained from a survey of buildings having cracks and also with a few physical models. It was found that the pattern (orientation and location) of cracking depends significantly on whether the wall is <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> or <b>framed</b> by the reinforced concrete elements.

In {{last years}} {{researchers}} preferred behavior-based design of structure to force-based one for designing {{and construction of}} the earthquake- resistance structures, this method is named performance based designing. The main goal of this method is designing of structure members for a certain performance or behavior. On the other hand in most of buildings, <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>frames</b> are infilled with masonry materials which leads to considerable changes in mechanical properties of frames. But usually infilling wall’s effect has been ignored in nonlinear analysis of structures because of complication {{of the problem and}} lack of simple logical solution. As a result lateral stiffness, strength, ductility and performance of the structure will be computed with less accuracy. In this paper by use of Smooth hysteretic model for masonry infillings, some high ductile RC frames (4, 8 stories including 1, 2 and 3 spans) designed according to Iranian code are considered. They have been analyzed by nonlinear dynamic method in two states, with and without infilling.

50|$|Most {{construction}} projects {{require the use}} of hundreds of different materials.

Cost is commonly the controlling element; however, other considerations such as weight, strength, constructability, availability, sustainability, and fire resistance will be taken into account before a final decision is made.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a tool used for the life cycle assessment of residential buildings located in three different European towns: Brussels (Belgium), Coimbra (Portugal) and Luleå (Sweden). The basic tool focuses on the structure and the materials of the buildings and permits the evaluation of the Embodied energy, Embodied carbon and yearly energy consumption. For that purpose, a different set of original data is taken into account for each location, in which the monthly temperatures, energy mix, heating and cooling systems are defined. The energy consumption, being for heating space or water, for cooling or for lighting is transformed into CO 2 emissions to deduce the Operational carbon as well. The influence of the energy mix can therefore be assessed in the basic tool. As a matter of fact, the heating and cooling systems habitually used in the three countries are also of great importance. The District Heating system, is, for instance, incorporated in the basic tool. The presence of solar water heater or photovoltaic panels is also strongly influencing the operational carbon. After a short literature review on building LCA and the description of the basic tool, the software Pleiades + Comfie combined with Equer is used to achieve the complete LCA for one building using two different <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>frames.</b> The results of the calculations for Brussels climate are verified against these software results.

40|$|Fire is {{a serious}} threat to people and the {{structures}} they build. There is a continuous development of newer methods and materials to prevent its effects on them. Nowadays, a lot of attention is being paid in the design of public and commercial buildings by incorporating fire safety. Passive fireproofing of high-rise structures has become very important due to the use of steel in <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> mode and has attracted increased attention {{after the collapse of the}} WTC towers. Conventional passive fireproofing materials include concrete covering, gypsum board and cementitious coatings which have a poor aesthetic. Intumescent fire-resistive coatings are a newer type of passive fireproofing coatings usually applied as thin film and they swell many times their original thickness forming an insulating char which acts as a barrier between the fire and the structural steel. It prevents the temperatures of the steel members from reaching a critical value and helps in maintaining the integrity of the structure in fire event. They are the preferred choice for passive fire protection of <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> steel <b>frame</b> structures of architects and designers as they offer aesthetic appearance, flexibility, speed of application, and ease of inspection and maintenance. The present review covers recent developments in the field of intumescent coatings with a major emphasis on organic intumescent coatings.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the in vitro <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity of four-unit posterior frameworks made of glass ceramic with lithium-disilicate crystals (E 2), of zirconia-reinforced glass-infiltrated alumina (ICZ) and of zirconia stabilized with 3 mol% yttria (CEZ). METHODS: All frameworks mimicked a four-unit posterior situation with 7. 3 mm 2 interdental cross-sections and possessed exactly the same dimensions. The <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity was measured on a special bridge test setup with 15 specimens for each of the materials. The data were analyzed with Weibull statistics giving the characteristic <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity F 0 at 63 % failure probability and the Weibull modulus m as indicator for the reliability and reproducibility. RESULTS: For the E 2 frameworks the average <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity and the SD was 260 (+/- 53) N, the characteristic load F 0 282 N and the reliability m = 5. 7. For the ICZ frameworks the average <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity was 470 (+/- 101) N, F 0 518 N and m = 4. 5.

The <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> structure is made of reinforced concrete, based on strip and isolated foundation footings, slabs, columns and walls. It is analysed with the programme Tower 7, which utilises the final elements method. Two computational models of the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> structure are built. The first one is used to analyse the typical ceiling construction in the building. Besides the slab, we also include some vertical <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> elements {{above and below the}} slab into the model. To analyse the vertical <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> elements we create a more complex three-dimensional computational model of the whole <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> construction. The ceiling slab analysis takes into account both the dead load as well as the live load. The analysis of the whole <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> structure also includes snow load and the horizontal effects of wind and earthquake.

40|$|Pressure locked {{gratings}} {{have many}} uses, both {{on land and}} at sea. This is mainly due to {{the high degree of}} flexibility in dimensions and <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity. Despite the many uses in our surroundings, the term pressure locked grating is unknown to many. This term refers {{to the way in which}} the most important connection in pressure locked gratings is manufactured. Pressure locked gratings are galvanized and/or coated to prevent corrosion, galvanization is almost always used. This thesis is primarily focused on the behavior of galvanized pressure locked gratings. A pressure locked grating is made up of three type of bars: <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars, cross bars and support bars. The connections between the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars and the cross bars are realized by pressing the cross bar into premade notch in the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bar. The bars will deform plastically, which results in a connection based only on friction. This connection is called a pressure locked connection. The <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars serve primarily for load transfer in one direction. The pressure locked connection weakens the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars. The cross bars redistribute a local load over the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars outside of the loading area and reduce the buckling length of the individual <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bar. The support bars are spot-welded to both the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> and cross bars. Pressure locked gratings are calculated according to RAL-GZ- 638, a standard published by the Deutsches Institut für Gütesicherung und Kennzeichnung e. V. In this standard, pressure locked gratings are calculated on the basis of linear elasticity theory. A calculation according to the EN 1993 - 1 - 1 is not possible because it is not suited for pressure locked gratings. The main objective of this thesis is to determine if a calculation based on the plasticity theory is possible for pressure locked gratings. Through the application of this theory the design strength can be greatly increased, which has a large economic potential. This research is divided up into four parts that are stated below. 9 ̆ 5 Analytical study 9 ̆ 5 Experimental study 9 ̆ 5 FEM validation 9 ̆ 5 Parametric study The vast diversity in size and properties and the complex functioning of the pressure locked connection make pressure locked gratings a difficult product to research. The pressure locked connection also has a big influence on the strength and stiffness. In this galvanizing has a big influence. The analytical study shows that pressure locked gratings fail through: local lateral torsional buckling of one of the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars, global lateral torsional buckling for the entire pressure locked grating or by a mechanism due to a plastic hinge in de <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars. To research the behavior, numerical models were developed in the FEM-package ABAQUS. To determine the accuracy of these models, experiments were carried out on a number of pressure locked grating geometries. The results of the tests were compared with FEM simulations which made it possible to validate the FEM-models. The validation has taken place on the basis of four test series. Three test series focused on failure mechanisms, namely: collapse due to a mechanism as a result of plastic hinges in the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars, test series 1 A, collapse due to local lateral torsional buckling, test series 2 A and collapse due to global lateral torsional buckling of the entire pressure locked grating, test series 2 B. The last test series, test series 1 B, is aimed at examining the structural behavior of a common used pressure locked grating. After this validation it is possible to make FEM-models for a large number of different geometries. The behavior of these geometries can then be analyzed. The validation shows that failure mode and failure load are correctly determined by the FEM models. There is however a notable difference between the stiffness of the FEM-model and the stiffness of the test specimens. This difference is likely the result of the influence of the pressure locked connection between the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> and cross bars. The research shows that all aforementioned failure modes play a role depending on the dimensions of <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars and cross bars. For relatively thick-set <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars pressure locked gratings fail due to a mechanism as the result of plastic hinges in the <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars. For slender <b>load</b> <b>bearing</b> bars pressure locked gratings fail as a result of instabilities. With the aid of FEM models, it is possible to estimate the extent in which the plastic capacity is present in actually produced pressure locked gratings. This analysis shows that in 72...|$|R
