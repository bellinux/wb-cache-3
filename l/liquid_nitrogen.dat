5|$|Because the liquid-to-gas {{expansion}} ratio of nitrogen is 1:694 at 20°C, {{a tremendous amount}} of force can be generated if <b>liquid</b> <b>nitrogen</b> is rapidly vaporised in an enclosed space. In an incident on January 12, 2006 at Texas A University, the pressure-relief devices of a tank of <b>liquid</b> <b>nitrogen</b> were malfunctioning and later sealed. As a result of the subsequent pressure buildup, the tank failed catastrophically. The force of the explosion was sufficient to propel the tank through the ceiling immediately above it, shatter a reinforced concrete beam immediately below it, and blow the walls of the laboratory 0.1–0.2m off their foundations.|$|E
5|$|Vessels {{containing}} <b>liquid</b> <b>nitrogen</b> can condense oxygen from air. The {{liquid in}} such a vessel becomes increasingly enriched in oxygen (boiling point −183°C) as the nitrogen evaporates, and can cause violent oxidation of organic material.|$|E

5|$|At {{atmospheric}} pressure, {{molecular nitrogen}} condenses (liquefies) at 77K (−195.79°C) and freezes at 63K (−210.01°C) into the beta hexagonal close-packed crystal allotropic form. Below 35.4K (−237.6°C) nitrogen assumes the cubic crystal allotropic form (called the alpha phase). <b>Liquid</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> a colourless fluid resembling water in appearance, but with 80.8% of the density (the density of <b>liquid</b> <b>nitrogen</b> at its boiling point is 0.808g/mL), {{is a common}} cryogen. Solid nitrogen has many crystalline modifications. It forms a significant dynamic surface coverage on Pluto and outer moons of the Solar System such as Triton. Even at the low temperatures of solid nitrogen it is fairly volatile and can sublime to form an atmosphere, or condense back into nitrogen frost.

5|$|Like dry ice, {{the main}} use of <b>liquid</b> <b>nitrogen</b> is as a refrigerant. Among other things, {{it is used}} in the {{cryopreservation}} of blood, reproductive cells (sperm and egg), and other biological samples and materials.

It is used in cold traps for certain laboratory equipment and to cool infrared detectors or X-ray detectors. It has also been used to cool central processing units and other devices in computers that are overclocked, and that produce more heat than during normal operation. Other uses include freeze-grinding and machining materials that are soft or rubbery at room temperature, shrink-fitting and assembling engineering components, and more generally to attain very low temperatures whenever necessary (around −200°C). Because of its low cost, <b>liquid</b> <b>nitrogen</b> is also often used when such low temperatures are not strictly necessary, such as refrigeration of food, freeze-branding livestock, freezing pipes to halt flow when valves are not present, and consolidating unstable soil by freezing whenever excavation is going on underneath.|$|E

The Municipality of La Pintada (Antioquia), {{is characterized by the}} presence of dry tropical forest relicts, fishing, tourism, farms and mining. An entomological research was performed for explore the possible circulation of arboviruses of public health importance. Materials and methods. Mosquitoes were captured in urban and rural sites in February-April of 2012. The specimens were stored in <b>liquid</b> <b>nitrogens</b> tanks and were grouped using taxonomic keys for genera. RNA extraction from pools and generic/nested RT-PCR was performed for Flavivirus, Alphavirus, Orthobunyavirus (Group Bunyamwera) and Phlebovirus. Results. 1274 mosquitoes were collected, mainly belonging to Culex and Aedes genera. RNA extracts of 64 pools were tested by RT-PCR and one pool was positive for Alphavirus. Sequencing of the RT-PCR product and the analysis with sequences storage in GenBank designate the presence of Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV). Conclusions. This is the first record of natural infection from EEEV in mosquitoes from La Pintada (Antioquia), an area with ecological elements that favor the emergence of emerging and re-emerging arboviruses of medical and veterinarian importance...|$|R

5|$|Using {{synchrotron}} radiation frequently has specific requirements for X-ray crystallography. The intense ionizing radiation can cause radiation damage to samples, particularly macromolecular crystals. Cryo crystallography protects the sample from radiation damage, by freezing the crystal at <b>liquid</b> <b>nitrogen</b> temperatures (~100 K). However, {{synchrotron radiation}} frequently {{has the advantage}} of user selectable wavelengths, allowing for anomalous scattering experiments which maximizes anomalous signal.

Since <b>liquid</b> <b>nitrogen</b> is less expensive than the liquid helium required for metallic superconductors, the operating costs for applications would be less.|$|E
