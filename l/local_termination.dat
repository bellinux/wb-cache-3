The Fe/SiO 2 {{ratio in}} slag {{is one of}} the {{important}} control parameters for copper flash smelting process, {{but it is difficult to}} describe the complex relationship between the technological parameters and the Fe/SiO 2 ratio in slag using accurate mathematic formulae, because the copper flash smelting process is a complicated nonlinear system. An neural network model for the Fe/SiO 2 ratio in copper flash smelting slag was developed, whose net structure is 8 - 15 - 12 - 1, and input nodes include the oxygen volume per ton concentrate, the oxygen grade, the flux rate, the quantity of Cu, S, Fe, SiO 2 and MgO in concentrate. In order to avoid <b>local</b> minimum <b>terminations</b> when the model is trained by back propagation (BP) algorithm, a new algorithm called GA-BP is presented by using genetic algorithm (GA) to determine the initial weights and threshold values.

40|$|Abstract. The {{characterisation}} of termination using well-founded monotone algebras {{has been}} a milestone {{on the way to}} automated termination techniques, of which we have seen an extensive development over the past years. Both the semantic characterisation and most known termination methods are concerned with global termination, uniformly of all the terms of a term rewriting system (TRS). In this paper we consider <b>local</b> <b>termination,</b> of specific sets of terms within a given TRS. The principal goal of this paper is generalising the semantic characterisation of global termination to <b>local</b> <b>termination.</b> This is made possible by admitting the well-founded monotone algebras to be partial. We also extend our approach to local relative termination. The interest in <b>local</b> <b>termination</b> naturally arises in program verification, where one is probably interested only in sensible inputs, or just wants to characterise the set of inputs for which a program terminates. <b>Local</b> <b>termination</b> will be also be of interest when dealing with a specific class of terms within a TRS that is known to be non-terminating, such as combinatory logic (CL) or a TRS encoding recursive program schemes or Turing machines. We show how some of the well-known techniques for proving global termination, such as stepwise removal of rewrite rules and semantic labelling, can be adapted to the local case. We also describe transformations reducing local to global termination problems. The resulting techniques for proving <b>local</b> <b>termination</b> have in some cases already been automated. One of our applications concerns the characterisation of the terminating S-terms in CL as regular language. Previously this language had already been found via a tedious analysis of the reduction behaviour of S-terms. These findings have now been vindicated by a fully automated and verified proof. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Disconnections between {{structures}} in the brain have long been hypothesized to be the mechanism behind numerous disease states and pathological behavioral phe-notypes. Advances in diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) {{provide an opportunity to}} study white matter, and there-fore brain connectivity, in great detail. DWI-based research assesses white matter at two different scales: voxelwise indexes of anisotropy such as fractional anisotropy (FA) are used to compare small units of tissue and network-based methods compare tractography-based models of whole-brain connectivity. We propose a method called local termi-nation pattern analysis (LTPA) that considers information about both local and global brain connectivity simultane-ously. LTPA itemizes the subset of streamlines that pass through a small set of white matter voxels. The “local termi-nation pattern ” is a vector defined by counts of these stream-lines terminating in pairs of cortical regions. To assess the reliability of our method we applied LTPA exhaustively over white matter voxels to produce complete maps of <b>local</b> <b>termination</b> pattern similarity, based on diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) data from 11 individuals in triplicate. Here we show that <b>local</b> <b>termination</b> patterns from an individual are highly reproducible across the entire brain.

Four anatomic aspects were considered: 1) Number of testicular veins, 2) The <b>local</b> of vein <b>termination,</b> 3) Type and number of collaterals present and 4) Testicular vein termination angle. Results: Cadavers – Right side – One testicular vein occurred in 85 % and 2 veins in 5 % of the cases. There were communi-cating veins with the colon in 21 % of the cases. Left side – One testicular vein occurred in 82 %, two veins in 15 %, three veins in 2 % and four veins in 1 % of the cases. There were communicating veins with the colon in 31 % of the cases. Fetuses – Right side –One testicular vein occurred in all cases. This vein drained to the vena cava in 83. 3 % of the cases, to the junction of the vena cava with the renal vein in 12. 5 % and to the renal vein in 4. 2 %. There were communicating veins with the colon in 25 % of the cases. Left side – One testicular vein occurred in 66. 6 % of the cases, and 2 veins in occurred 33. 3 %.

This new approach al-lows to translate transformations in (C 1,M 1) into corresponding transformations in (C 2,M 2) and, vice versa, to create transformations in (C 1,M 1) from those in (C 2,M 2). This is helpful because our tool for reconfigurable Petri nets, the RON-tool, performs the analysis of Petri net transformations by analyzing corresponding graph transformations using the AGG-tool. Up to now, this correspondence has been implemented as a converter on an informal level. The formal correspondence results given by our framework make the RON-tool more reliable. In this paper we extend this framework to the transfer of <b>local</b> confluence, <b>termination</b> and func-tional behavior. In particular, {{we are able to}} create these properties for transforma-tions in (C 1,M 1) from corresponding properties of transformations in (C 2,M 2), where (C 1,M 1) are Petri nets with individual tokens and (C 2,M 2) typed attributed graphs.
