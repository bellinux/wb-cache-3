50|$|<b>Leaky</b> <b>feeder</b> {{system is}} also used for {{underground}} mobile communication in mass transit railways. In Hong Kong the <b>leaky</b> <b>feeder</b> aerial was incorporated in the specification of the capital project and installed during construction. This allows emergency services seamless mobile communication from the underground to the surface.|$|E
50|$|Mobile {{connectivity}} {{is provided}} in the underground section through <b>leaky</b> <b>feeder</b> cables installed underground tunnel. The <b>leaky</b> <b>feeder</b> cable is a cable whose insulation has been removed at certain locations. The cable carries radio frequency signals, and the exposed wire works like an antenna allowing mobile phones to send and receive information.|$|E
50|$|<b>Leaky</b> <b>feeder</b> {{antenna system}} {{can also be}} used to allow {{reception}} of on-board GSM and WiFi signals on passenger aircraft. The weight and space requirements of <b>leaky</b> <b>feeder</b> systems are usually lower than comparable antenna systems, thus saving space and fuel. The even field strengths produced by runs of leaky feeders spanning the entire fuselage improve coverage while requiring less transmitting power.|$|E
30|$|The {{measurements}} {{have been}} performed using standard antennas. An alternative to providing in-cabin coverage is using radiating cables, also called <b>leaky</b> <b>feeders,</b> laid along {{the roof of the}} cabin [3].|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{invention}} by Saleh et al., tunnel transmitters and <b>leaky</b> <b>feeders</b> {{had been used}} to provide radio reception in tunnels, mines, subway lines, and other indoor and underground spaces.|$|R
25|$|In the 1990s, the two phone booths {{inside each}} {{trainset}} {{were connected to}} Deutsche Telekom's C-Netz by 13 so-called Funkfeststationen. Inside the tunnels {{of the first two}} high-speed lines, repeaters were installed at a distance of 1500 meters that communicated with the trains using <b>leaky</b> <b>feeders.</b> Between the tunnels, directional antennas were used. Inside the trains, antennas were installed in the service cars. Calls cost 0.7 DM per time unit. The same time unit cost 0.23 DM when using a landline.|$|R
5000|$|The tunnel {{has been}} {{fitted with a}} <b>leaky</b> <b>feeder</b> system to permit {{operation}} of mobile phones. The tunnel is [...] long.|$|E
50|$|The Euroloop is an {{extension}} for Eurobalises in ETCS Level 1. It is a special <b>Leaky</b> <b>feeder</b> for transmitting information telegrams to the car.|$|E
50|$|<b>Leaky</b> <b>feeder</b> {{has been}} used in the mining {{industry}} as a method of wireless communication between miners. The system is used as a primary communication system which has a transceiver small enough to be comfortably worn on a miner throughout an entire shift.|$|E
40|$|The optimum {{efficiency}} of a leaky cable as a support for radio communications in tunnels involves {{a compromise between}} high leakage fields and a low increase of the coaxial mode attenuation. The latter is an important disadvantage of continuous <b>leaky</b> <b>feeders.</b> To obviate this, short leaky sections can be inserted in an otherwise well-shielded coaxial cable. These sections act as mode converters or radiators. A theoretical analysis based on coupled line theory enables us to determine the optimum characteristics of the leaky sections. Numerous experiments were carried out in a tunnel at various frequencies, using different lengths and characteristics of the leaky sections. Anglai...|$|R
40|$|This paper gives a brief {{review of}} various aspects of {{electromagnetic}} (EM) wave propagation in tunnels and of radio communication in such media. First a quantitative description is given for the propagation in empty tunnels and in tunnels containing axial conductors or <b>leaky</b> <b>feeders.</b> The limitations of such simplified approaches are stressed. A review of quantitative studies of these phenomena is then presented. Engineering considerations are briefly mentioned. Attention is drawn to mode conversion techniques, which play an important role, and to the multimode operation of systems. It is concluded that the theoretical aspects of EM wave propagation in tunnels are currently well understood, although work remains to be done on wide-band and microwave communication systems...|$|R
30|$|In {{the past}} 10  years, the {{independent}} and innovative communications-based {{train control system}} has experienced breakthroughs in key technologies by conducting pilot experiments, field tests, and demonstration projects. For the first time, the design theories and technical aspects of moving block systems, which cover the entire life cycle of fail-safe systems, are set up. The models and algorithms are proposed to control the safe operation of trains. The safety technologies for short-interval train sequencing are adopted to realize the 90  s headway between consecutive trains. The optimized automatic train operation strategies are used to save energy and allow trains to safely reach their destinations. The highly dependable and bi-directional train-to-ground communication technologies are introduced for reliable transmission of safety related train-to-ground information in a complex environment which is compatible with multiple media, such as free waves, leaky waveguides, and <b>leaky</b> <b>feeders.</b> The simulation, tests, and verification technologies based on the minimum system and test cases were adopted to conduct the following: principle demonstration, functional tests, integrated tests, field failure data replay, analysis and disposal, system upgrade, and maintenance.|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} to using <b>leaky</b> <b>feeder</b> in underground railways {{is to use}} Distributed Antenna System (DAS). A DAS system was deployed in some New York City Subway stations by Transit Wireless to provide WiFi and mobile phone and data coverage for customers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Leaky</b> <b>feeder</b> is {{also being}} used in {{warehouses}} and other industrial buildings where {{it is difficult to}} get WiFi coverage using normal access points. Real life installations with 50-75 meters of leaky wire connected to the antenna input of Access Points exist, and are working fine.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>leaky</b> <b>feeder</b> is a {{communications}} system used in underground mining and other tunnel environments. [...] Manufacturers and cabling professionals {{use the term}} [...] "radiating cable" [...] as this implies that the cable is designed to radiate: something that coaxial cable is not generally supposed to do.|$|E
50|$|London Underground uses a <b>leaky</b> <b>feeder</b> {{system for}} their {{internal}} communication network Connect. The emergency services' communications system however was not compatible {{and did not}} work underground. The fact that this situation continued to exist after the 1987 King's Cross fire was criticized in the reports from the 7 July 2005 London bombings, where it hampered rescue efforts.|$|E
50|$|Communication system.The CBTC systems {{integrate}} {{a digital}} networked radio system {{by means of}} antennas or <b>leaky</b> <b>feeder</b> cable for the bi-directional communication between the track equipment and the trains. The 2,4GHz band is commonly used in these systems (same as WiFi), though other alternative frequencies such as 900 MHz (US), 5.8 GHz or other licensed bands {{may be used as}} well.|$|E
50|$|In {{systems with}} poor {{line of sight}} or spectrum/bandwidth {{limitations}} a larger than anticipated number of transponders {{may be required to}} enhance the service. This is usually more of an issue with applying CBTC to existing transit systems in tunnels that were not designed from the outset to support it. An alternate method to improve system availability in tunnels is the use of <b>leaky</b> <b>feeder</b> cable that, while having higher initial costs (material + installation) achieves a more reliable radio link.|$|E
50|$|A balise transmits telegrams at a {{specific}} site. To allow a continuous transmission the telegrams may be sent along <b>leaky</b> <b>feeder</b> cable being up to 1000 metres long. The Euroloop cable is always connected with a balise at its end which serves as the End of Loop Marker (EOLM). The telegram structure {{is the same as}} for the balise it is connected to. Originally the Euroloop used the same frequency as the Eurobalises but that was changed for specification 2.0.1 in September 2004. Euroloops had been used in Switzerland which completed the change in July 2010.|$|E
50|$|IC Radio {{was founded}} in November 1975 with the {{intention}} of broadcasting to the student halls of residence from a studio under Southside. Broadcasting actually commenced in late 1976 on 999 AM although IC Radio has since stopped broadcasting over this frequency. Imperial College Radio pioneered a new system of broadcast, known as <b>Leaky</b> <b>feeder</b> and was the first station to be licensed by the Home Office for the use of this technique. For a short period in 1989, IC Radio broadcast on FM under a Test and Development license, but this way never expanded into a full FM license. In 2001 it moved to its current location, in the West Basement of Beit Quad over the internet www.icradio.com and, since 2004, on 1134 AM in Wye.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>leaky</b> <b>feeder</b> {{communication}} system {{consists of a}} coaxial cable run along tunnels which emits and receives radio waves, functioning as an extended antenna. The cable is [...] "leaky" [...] in that it has gaps or slots in its outer conductor to allow the radio signal to leak into {{or out of the}} cable along its entire length. Because of this leakage of signal, line amplifiers are required to be inserted at regular intervals, typically every 350 to 500 m, to boost the signal back up to acceptable levels. The signal is usually picked up by portable transceivers carried by personnel. Transmissions from the transceivers are picked up by the feeder and carried {{to other parts of the}} tunnel, allowing two-way radio communication throughout the tunnel system.|$|E
50|$|For {{most of its}} history, UKC Radio was {{available}} on 300m Medium Wave (officially 998 kHz AM, though it apparently used a 1 MHz crystal as these were far cheaper) via induction loops which were {{on the top of}} the college buildings - meaning you could only hear the station in limited parts of the campus. The inductive loops used a figure-of-eight configuration to prevent off-campus radiation in accordance with the licence conditions. These loops actually operated as a kind of <b>leaky</b> <b>feeder,</b> with a single strand of cable draped around the roof of the buildings, connected to a coax cable that linked via the central boiler room to the original transmitter (called Amanda by the engineers) in Eliot. This was replaced with a Wireless Workshop transmitter in 1995 (called Fred).|$|E
50|$|Texas Tech's first {{radio station}} wasn’t a true {{broadcast}} radio station, but a carrier current station, where a low-power AM signal {{is sent to}} receivers through a building's electrical wiring. Signal reception was limited to receivers either plugged directly into the building's electrical system or placed {{close enough to the}} power lines which would act as a <b>leaky</b> <b>feeder.</b> The signal was limited to the building in which it was broadcast, because the electrical transformers and switch gear that supplied electricity to the building, would prevent the signal being passed elsewhere. Additional wiring had to be run directly to other buildings for the signal to be heard in them. Carrier current stations are not licensed by the FCC, but operate under the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, Part 15 (Title 47 CFR Part 15). Such stations are not issued official call signs nor are they subject to federal regulation as commercial radio stations are. Despite their limited range, carrier current stations offer several benefits: their transmitters are rather cheap and easy to construct, they can operate on any AM frequency, and if the signal originates on the campus of an educational institution, there is theoretically no power limit. By increasing the transmitter power and using inline filters, the signal quality is improved and a greater number of buildings can be served. It was these qualities that made carrier current stations quite popular among many educational institutions throughout the 1950s, including Texas Tech.|$|E

40|$|The basic {{mechanisms}} of tunnel propagation and of underground radio systems are briefly reviewed. The TEM approximation of the monofilar mode is compared with available rigorous solutions. Below the tunnel cutoff frequencies, the <b>leaky</b> <b>feeder</b> techniques {{can be described}} by the coupled line methods or, with a simpler physical picture, {{by the use of}} two eigenmodes. The only valid explanation of the <b>leaky</b> <b>feeder</b> radiation at higher frequencies is the random diffraction of the feeder leakage fields by the wall irregularities. To avoid the inefficiency of this process, the insertion of leaky stubs in a well-shielded coaxial cable is proposed. Anglai...|$|E

40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{tremendous}} development of GSM services over the last years, the number of related services used by organizations has drastically increased. Therefore, monitoring GSM services is becoming a business critical issue {{in order to be able}} to react appropriately in case of incident. In order to provide with GSM coverage all the CERN underground facilities, more than 50 km of <b>leaky</b> <b>feeder</b> cable have been deployed. This infrastructure is also used to propagate VHF radio signals for the CERN’s fire brigade. Even though CERN’s mobile operator monitors the network, it cannot guarantee the availability of GSM services, and for sure not VHF services, where signals are carried by the <b>leaky</b> <b>feeder</b> cable. So, a global monitoring system has become critical to CERN. In addition, monitoring this infrastructure will allow to characterize its behaviour over time, especially with LHC operation. Given that commercial solutions were not yet mature, CERN developed a system based on GSM probes and an application server which collects data from them via the CERN GPRS network. By placing probes in strategic locations and comparing measurements between probes, it is possible now possible to determine if there is a GSM or VHF problem on one <b>leaky</b> <b>feeder</b> cable segment. This system has been successfully working for several months in underground facilities, allowing CERN to inform GSM users and fire brigade in case of incidents...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a hybrid leaky feeder/fiber-optic transmission system {{for use in}} underground transportation networks. The system has a 1. 6 -Gb/s throughput and features an ultrawideband axial slot <b>leaky</b> <b>feeder,</b> {{which is based on}} a standard semirigid coaxial cable as a fixed antenna. Patch antennas with a 4 -GHz center frequency and a 1 -GHz, 10 -dB bandwidth are proposed for the rolling stock. This highest reported data rate was achieved by combining two 800 -Mb/s in-phase and quadrature (I and Q) phase-shift keying (PSK) modulated data streams. A specially designed carrier and data synchronization system provided a convenient interface to a 1. 3 / 1. 5 -μm diplex single-mode fiber-remoting network. The measured 2. 4 - to 6 -GHz <b>leaky</b> <b>feeder</b> bandwidth allows multiradio multiband wireless mesh networking and, therefore, low-contention gigabit rolling stock data communications. © 2008 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|It {{is often}} {{desirable}} to control mobile phone services {{in areas where}} complete silence is either expected or mandatory, including schools, places of worship, hospitals, and prisons. In contrast to conventional techniques, such as jammers or Faraday cages, we present a novel technique to selectively control mobile phone services within a desired area. Our solution enables the area’s keeper to allow mobile phones on a whitelist to freely use mobile services without disruption while denying services to all other mobile phones that are {{within the boundaries of}} the desired area to be controlled. Our solution uses a base station controller to identify all mobile devices located within the area to be controlled, while an antenna is placed inside the area to attract all mobile devices in the area to connect to the base station controller. In previous work, we proposed a system that uses directional antennas for the attraction technique. In this work, we show that replacement of the directional antennas with a <b>leaky</b> <b>feeder</b> antenna enables more accurate control of mobile phone services in and around the area to be controlled. Simulations and experiments of the <b>leaky</b> <b>feeder</b> technique confirm its precise control of mobile phone services within the desired areas...|$|E
