40|$|Background The rate of extra-hepatic <b>lactate</b> {{production}} and the route of influx of <b>lactate</b> to the liver may influence both hepatic and extra-hepatic <b>lactate</b> exchange. We assessed the dose-response of hepatic and extra-hepatic <b>lactate</b> exchange during portal and central venous <b>lactate</b> infusion. Methods Eighteen pigs randomly received either portal (n= 5) or central venous (n= 7) <b>lactate</b> infusion or saline (n= 6). Sodium <b>lactate</b> was infused at 33, 66, 99, and 133 µmol kg− 1 min− 1 for 20 min each. Systemic and regional abdominal blood flows and plasma <b>lactate</b> were measured at 20 min intervals until 1 h post-infusion, and regional <b>lactate</b> exchange was calculated (area under <b>lactate</b> uptake-time curve). Results Total hepatic <b>lactate</b> uptake [median (95 % confidence interval) ] during the experimental protocol (140 min) was higher during portal [8198 (5487 - 12 798) µmol kg− 1] than during central venous <b>lactate</b> infusion [4530 (3903 - 5514) µmol kg− 1, P< 0. 05]. At a similar hepatic <b>lactate</b> delivery (∼ 400 µmol kg− 1 min− 1), hepatic <b>lactate</b> uptake [mean and standard deviation (sd) ] was higher during portal [118 (sd 55) µmol kg− 1 min− 1] than during central venous <b>lactate</b> infusion [44 (12) µmol kg− 1 min− 1, P< 0. 05]. Time courses of arterial <b>lactate</b> concentrations and <b>lactate</b> uptake at other measured regions were similar in both groups.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the accuracy of the <b>Lactate</b> Pro hand-held analyser in measuring blood <b>lactate</b> levels. METHODS: Blood was drawn from 15 healthy dogs into five tubes containing Na-EDTA. <b>Lactate</b> was measured immediately using the <b>Lactate</b> Pro analyser and a laboratory reference method. Further samples were analysed 120, 240, 480 and 1440 minutes later to artificially increase the <b>lactate</b> levels. <b>Lactate</b> was measured in blood samples of 60 healthy dogs using the <b>Lactate</b> Pro analyser to determine the reference interval of <b>lactate</b> concentration in normal dogs. RESULTS: The correlation between the <b>lactate</b> concentration measured with the <b>Lactate</b> Pro analyser and the reference method was high. <b>Lactate</b> levels were lower when measured with the handheld analyser than with the traditional laboratory determination. The reference interval for blood <b>lactate</b> concentrations in healthy dogs established by the <b>Lactate</b> Pro analyser was from the detection limit (0. 8 mmol/l) up to 3. 3 mmol/l. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The <b>Lactate</b> Pro analyser provides quick and reliable measurements of blood <b>lactate</b> in dogs with blood <b>lactate</b> levels up to 10 mmol/l.

40|$|High-intensity {{exercise}} training {{contributes to}} the production and accumulation of blood <b>lactate,</b> which is cleared by active recovery. However, there is no commonly agreed intensity or mode for clearing accumulated blood <b>lactate.</b> We studied clearance of accumulated blood <b>lactate</b> during recovery at various exercise intensities at or below the <b>lactate</b> threshold after high-intensity interval runs that prompted <b>lactate</b> accumulation. Ten males repeated 5 -min running bouts at 90 % of maximal oxygen uptake ([Vdot]O 2 max), which increased blood <b>lactate</b> concentration from 1. 0 ± 0. 1 to 3. 9 ± 0. 3 mmol · l- 1. This was followed by recovery exercises ranging from 0 to 100 % of <b>lactate</b> threshold. Repeated blood <b>lactate</b> measurements showed faster clearance of <b>lactate</b> during active versus passive recovery, and that the decrease in <b>lactate</b> was more rapid during higher (60 - 100 % of <b>lactate</b> threshold) than lower (0 - 40 % of <b>lactate</b> threshold) (P &# 60; 0. 05) intensities.

Ethanol was administered by mouth at hourly intervals, 60 ml of bonded whiskey initially and 30 ml/hr thereafter. Blood <b>lactate</b> concentrations increased precipitously after {{the administration of}} ethanol, reached a plateau within 120 - 180 min, and remained constant thereafter despite the continued administration of ethanol. Before ethanol, the <b>lactate</b> turnover rate was 0. 76 mmoles/kg per hr ± 0. 05 (SEM) and <b>lactate</b> inflow and outflow rates were closely balanced. During the administration of ethanol, the <b>lactate</b> inflow rate was unchanged, but the <b>lactate</b> outflow rate was significantly inhibited, decreasing to 50 % of the inflow rate.

40|$|Streptococcus cremoris {{was grown}} in pH-regulated batch and {{continuous}} cultures with lactose as the energy source. During growth {{the magnitude and}} composition of the electrochemical proton gradient and the <b>lactate</b> concentration gradient were determined. The upper limit {{of the number of}} protons translocated with a <b>lactate</b> molecule during <b>lactate</b> excretion (the proton-lactate stoichiometry) was calculated from the magnitudes of the membrane potential, the transmembrane pH difference, and the <b>lactate</b> concentration gradient. In cells growing in continuous culture, a low <b>lactate</b> concentration gradient (an internal <b>lactate</b> concentration of 35 to 45 mM at an external <b>lactate</b> concentration of 25 mM) existed. The cell yield (Ymax lactose) increased with increasing growth pH. In batch culture at pH 6. 34, a considerable <b>lactate</b> gradient (more than 60 mV) was present during the early stages of growth. As growth continued, the electrochemical proton gradient did not change significantly (from - 100 to - 110 mV), but the <b>lactate</b> gradient decreased gradually. The H+-lactate stoichiometry of the excretion process decreased from 1. 5 to about 0. 9. In nongrowing cells, the magnitude and composition of the electrochemical proton gradient was dependent on the external pH but not on the external <b>lactate</b> concentration (up to 50 mM). The magnitude of the <b>lactate</b> gradient was independent of the external pH but decreased greatly with increasing external <b>lactate</b> concentrations. At very low <b>lactate</b> concentrations, a <b>lactate</b> gradient of 100 mV existed, which decreased to about 40 mV at 50 mM external <b>lactate.</b> As a consequence, the proton-lactate stoichiometry decreased with increasing external concentrations of protons and <b>lactate</b> at pH 7. 0 from 1 mM <b>lactate</b> to 1. 1 at 50 mM <b>lactate</b> and at pH 5. 5 from 1. 4 at l mM <b>lactate</b> to 0. 7 at 50 mM <b>lactate.</b> The data presented in this paper suggest that a decrease in external pH and an increase in external <b>lactate</b> concentration both result in lower proton-lactate stoichiometry values and therefore in a decrease of the generation of metabolic energy by the end product efflux process...|$|R
40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of hyperlactatemia during sepsis {{is poorly}} understood. We have previously described {{an increase in}} <b>lactate</b> concentration across the lung in the dog during early endotoxemia. Accordingly, we sought {{to determine if the}} lung releases <b>lactate</b> in humans and what relation this has with lung injury. Methods: We measured <b>lactate</b> concentrations across the lung and lung injury scores (LIS) in two groups of patients. Group 1 consisted of nine patients with acute lung injury (LIS ≤ 2. 0) and elevated <b>lactate</b> concentrations (> 2. 0 mmol/L). Group 2 contained 12 patients with no acute lung injury (LIS scores ≤ 1. 5), with or without increased <b>lactate</b> concentrations. Simultaneous measurements of plasma <b>lactate</b> and blood gases were obtained from indwelling arterial and pulmonary artery, catheters. Measurements of cardiac output were also obtained. <b>Lactate</b> measurements were done using a <b>lactate</b> analyzer (YSI; Yellow Springs, Ohio). Results: For each patient with acute lung injury and hyperlactatemia, an arterial-venous <b>lactate</b> gradient existed demonstrating release of <b>lactate</b> by the lung. This gradient persisted after correction for changes in hemoconcentration across the lung. The mean <b>lactate</b> gradient across the lung was 0. 4 ± 0. 2 mmol/L for group 1 vs 0. 05 ± 0. 1 mmol/L for group 2 (p= 0. 001). This corresponded to a mean pulmonary <b>lactate</b> flux of 231. 3 ± 211. 3 vs 5. 0 ± 37. 2 mmol/h (p= 0. 001). The <b>lactate</b> flux and the arterial-venous <b>lactate</b> difference correlated with LIS both for the entire sample and for the subgroup with hyperlactatemia (r= 0. 69, p < 0. 01). Pulmonary <b>lactate</b> flux was not related to arterial <b>lactate</b> levels (r= 0. 25).

Parallel to these changes, the myocardium {{is expected to}} switch {{from the use of}} primarily <b>lactate</b> before birth to fatty acids thereafter. However, myocardial <b>lactate</b> uptake and oxidation around birth has not been measured in vivo. Methods and Results-We measured myocardial <b>lactate</b> uptake, oxidation, and release with infusion of [1 -C- 13]lactate and myocardial flux of fatty acids and glucose in chronically instrumented fetal and newborn (1 to 15 days) lambs. Myocardial <b>lactate</b> oxidation was the same in newborn (81. 7 +/- 14. 7 mu mol. min(- 1). 100 g(- 1), n= 11) as in fetal Iambs (60. 7 +/- 26. 7 mu mol. min(- 1). 100 g(- 1), n= 7). <b>Lactate</b> uptake was also the same in newborn as in fetal lambs. <b>Lactate</b> uptake was higher than <b>lactate</b> flux, indicating <b>lactate</b> release simultaneously with uptake. In the newborn lambs, <b>lactate</b> uptake declined with age. <b>Lactate</b> uptake was strongly related to <b>lactate</b> supply, whereas <b>lactate</b> oxidation was not. The supply of fatty acids or glucose did not interfere with <b>lactate</b> uptake, but the nux of fatty acids was inversely related to <b>lactate</b> oxidation. Conclusions-We show that <b>lactate</b> is an important energy source for the myocardium before birth {{as well as in the}} first 2 weeks after birth in lambs.

40|$|At rest, {{the brain}} takes up oxygen and {{carbohydrate}} at an ~ 6 : 1 ratio. Exercise increases systemic <b>lactate</b> availability reducing this to {{as little as}} 1. 7 : 1 despite a ~ 20 % increase in cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRo₂), thus indicating a disproportionate increase of carbohydrate metabolism. Underlining mechanisms and metabolic fate for the augmented <b>lactate</b> uptake are unknown. This meta-analysis examines whether adrenergic activation explains the increased <b>lactate</b> uptake, cerebral <b>lactate</b> release following cerebral activation compensates for the extra carbohydrate uptake during exercise, and cerebral <b>lactate</b> uptake spares glucose as fuel. Ten studies (n= 96) measuring arteriovenous differences for <b>lactate,</b> glucose, and oxygen and cerebral blood flow were included. Cerebral <b>lactate</b> uptake increased during brain activation by whole-body exercise compared to the resting state. Unlike glucose, <b>lactate</b> uptake is proportional to its arterial concentration but is unaffected by sympathetic activity. Following exercise, significant cerebral <b>lactate</b> released as arterial <b>lactate</b> levels decreased, which may balance the surplus <b>lactate</b> uptake in the brain during physical activity in the long term. Finally, cerebral glucose uptake was reduced by ~ 25 % in relation to CMRo₂ when cerebral <b>lactate</b> uptake increased, suggesting, in part, preferential <b>lactate</b> consumption during activation. This meta-analysis favors the notion that cerebral <b>lactate</b> uptake is mainly passively governed by its availability, but when <b>lactate</b> is available, <b>lactate</b> supplements glucose and supports an increase in cerebral energy metabolism in an activity-dependent manner...|$|R
