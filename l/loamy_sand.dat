25|$|This {{species has}} a very limited {{distribution}} in the Australian Northern Territory. It is endemic to the area between Darwin and Berry Springs, but is fairly common there. It grows in the <b>loamy</b> <b>sand</b> of seasonally flooded depressions and in the shallow margins of freshwater lagoons. Here it shares its habitat with B. liniflora. which is however native to dryer regions elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{periodic}} inundation of Southern California by the ocean, most of the Aliso Creek watershed is underlain by several layers of marine sedimentary strata, the oldest dating from the Eocene (55.8–33.9MYA) and the most recent, the Pliocene (5.33–2.59MYA). These alluvial sediments range from [...] in depth. Generally throughout the watershed, there are five major soil and rock outcrop types—Capistrano sandy loam, Cieneba sandy loam, Marina <b>loamy</b> <b>sand,</b> Myford sandy loam, and Cieneba-rock outcrop.

2500|$|Local soil is Quaternary Alluvium. Common {{soil series}} include the Baywood fine sand {{on the east}} side, Narlon <b>loamy</b> <b>sand</b> on the west side, Sheridan coarse sandy loam on hilly terrain, and the pale Tangair sand on hills {{supporting}} closed-cone pine habitat. [...] The city is in a moderate to high seismic risk zone, the principal threat being the active San Andreas Fault approximately 26 miles (42km) to the east. The Monterey Bay fault, which tracks three miles (4.8km) to the north, is also active, as is the Palo Colorado fault seven miles (11.3km) to the south. Also nearby, minor but potentially active, are the Berwick Canyon, Seaside, Tularcitos and Chupines faults.|$|E
50|$|Few of the island's {{soils are}} {{well suited to}} agriculture. Most are coarse and, in well-drained areas, have classic podzol profile development; they are mapped as Kye <b>loamy</b> <b>sand</b> and Quinsam gravelly sandy loam. A small area of dark well-drained unpodzolized soil (Lazo <b>loamy</b> <b>sand)</b> is mapped around the {{southeast}} corner. Dashwood gravelly <b>loamy</b> <b>sand,</b> a brown podzolic trending to podzol, is commonly associated with Kye and Quinsam. Imperfectly drained areas have brown podzolic Bowser <b>loamy</b> <b>sand</b> or classic podzol Sayward <b>loamy</b> <b>sand.</b> The more moist Custer <b>loamy</b> <b>sand,</b> a groundwater podzol, is present locally. Poorly drained areas have Arrowsmith peat, Parksville sandy loam, or Tolmie loam (the latter two are gleysols).|$|E
50|$|A 1959 {{soil map}} identifies, {{from north to}} south, the {{following}} complex units: Kye-Coastal Beach; Bowser-Custer; Parksville-Bowser. Kye <b>loamy</b> <b>sand</b> is a classic podzol with well-defined eluvial (A2 or Ae) horizon. This series supports the well-drained forests. Coastal Beach land type represents bare or grassy regosol sand. The imperfectly drained Bowser <b>loamy</b> <b>sand</b> is podzolic but usually {{does not have an}} A2 horizon. Similarly moist <b>loamy</b> <b>sand</b> podzolic soils with strong A2 development are assigned to the Custer series. The Parksville sandy loam represents poorly drained gleysolic soils.|$|E
25|$|This ash {{has since}} {{developed}} a soil type called andisol. Soils in Crater Lake National Park are brown, dark brown or dark grayish-brown sandy loams or <b>loamy</b> <b>sands</b> which have plentiful cobbles, gravel and stones. They are slightly to moderately acidic and their drainage is somewhat excessive.|$|R
50|$|Soils {{around the}} lake are mostly well drained or rapidly drained gravelly sandy loams or gravelly <b>loamy</b> <b>sands</b> with brown podzolic profile development.

50|$|Cowles Bog is {{considered}} a fen, rather than a 'true' bog since it is more alkaline than a bog such as Pinhook Bog, {{also a part of}} the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. The main body of the bog is composed of muck created from marsh plants and the woody plants that have encroached into the area. Surrounding the bog proper is an area covered with a thin layer of leaf litter over a thin layer of topsoil. The area is moderately acidic. Wet depressions exist which reveal a substratum of Maumee soils, a <b>loamy</b> fine <b>sand.</b> These <b>loamy</b> <b>sands</b> extend southward through the marsh area. To the north the dunes consist of Plainfield fine sand, which is heavily oxidized.|$|R
40|$|Occupying cereal stubble-fields weed flora is {{the most}} {{characteristic}} of the environmental (especially soil) conditions. Because of its developing and accomplishing the reproductive stages there it can threatens cultivated plants. They are considered to complete the seed store in a soil by 393 min per ha. The results presented in the paper concern the species composition, number and constancy (S) and indice of coverage (D) of the cereal stubble-field weed species on various soils in the Kielce region (the central part of Poland). The report was based upon 885 phytosociological records collected in the 268 stands. The records were carried out after the crop harvest, {{in the latter part}} of September, in 1976 - 1980. Soil were chosen on the base of soil maps. The analyse of soil samples, taken at the investigation process, were done in order to confirm the soil quality. The worked out material was divided into three parts. The first part, including 369 phytosociological records collected in the 112 stands (in 90 localities) concerns stubble-field weeds on podzolic and brown soils developed from <b>sands</b> (loose, weakly <b>loamy</b> and loamy) and loams (light and medium). It was found that these soils were grown by 108 (<b>loamy</b> <b>sands)</b> to 132 (weakly <b>loamy</b> <b>sands)</b> weed species. Among them 66 species were common for all of the soils. Species composition was not differentiated by the soil type (brown, podzolic) within kind of the. soil (sand or loams). Among soil examined, the brown loams was the most abundant with species of high constancy degree (30 species) but brown loose <b>sands</b> and podzolic <b>loamy</b> <b>sands</b> was the poorest one with (16 species) ...|$|R

50|$|Vegetation in {{the park}} is typical for the region's forests with Douglas-fir most prominent. Common {{associates}} include Western hemlock, Sitka spruce, red alder and bigleaf maple. Salal is the most abundant shrub. Most of the park's soils were mapped as well-drained gravelly <b>loamy</b> <b>sands</b> or sandy loams and classified as brown podzolic in a soil survey published in 1959; however, the abundance of bleached sand grains on forest trails is evidence of an albic horizon characteristic of podzols.|$|R
50|$|Soils of Koksilah Ridge {{are well}} or rapidly drained gravelly sandy loams and gravelly <b>loamy</b> <b>sands</b> with podzol profile development. They support Coastal Western Hemlock-type forests in which Douglas-fir and western hemlock are most common at lower elevations.

It can be found less commonly on sandplains composed of deep <b>loamy</b> <b>sands,</b> where it will be found growing with ironwood (Acacia excelsa) and mulga (Acacia aneura). In the far west of New South Wales it grows in small terminal drainage depressions with sandy soils overlying clay at depth.|$|R
5000|$|The ground {{upon which}} the {{foundation}} must be built is unique in that it contains a [...] "technogenic layer" [...] {{just below the surface}} that is approximately 2.5 to 3 m in overall depth. The technogenic layer was created by radioactive contamination from the accident and consists of various materials including nuclear material, stone, <b>sand,</b> <b>loamy</b> <b>sands,</b> concrete (probably unreinforced), and construction wastes. It is considered unfeasible to determine the geotechnical characteristics of this soil layer. As a result of this, no assumptions about the load-bearing properties of the technogenic layer were made during the design of the foundation.|$|R

40|$|Crop {{water and}} {{irrigation}} water requirements of maize were estimated using the FAO CROPWAT {{model for the}} <b>loamy</b> <b>sands</b> of Kuwait. Agro-meteorological data 0 f 43 years was used for this purpose. The crop water requirement (ETc), irrigation requirement (IR) and net irrigation requirement (NIR) of maize vary with the planting date. Water use of grain maize was the lowest with planting date of 5 th November. The period 25 th October to 5 th December is suitable for maize planting. The ETc of grain maize varied from 210 mm for a 90 day crop to 273 mm for a 110 day crop with planting date 5 th November. The IR of grain maize varied from 126 mm for a 90 day crop to 179 mm for a 110 day crop with same planting date. The NIR varied from 1226 m 3 ha- 1 for a 90 day crop to 1898 m 3 ha- 1 for 110 day crop with planting date 5 th November. Grain maize planting may not be advanced beyond 5 th December, in order to economise the water use. Water use of sweet corn (60 days) was the lowest with planting date of 5 th December. The period 5 th November to 15 th December is suitable for sweet corn planting. ETc of sweet corn ranged from 125 mm (5 th December planting) to 182 mm (15 th October planting). The IR of sweet corn, ranged from 66 mm (5 th December planting) to 148 mm (15 th October planting). The NIR of sweet corn was 532 m 3 ha- 1 with planting date 5 th December.
