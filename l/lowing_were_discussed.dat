40|$|A failure {{analysis}} of the parachute on the Space Transportation System 3 flight's solid rocket booster's is presented. During the reentry phase of the two Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), one 115 ft diameter main parachute failed on the right hand SRB (A 12). This parachute failure caused the SRB to impact the Ocean at 110 ft/sec {{in lieu of the}} expected 3 parachute impact velocity of 88 ft/sec.
