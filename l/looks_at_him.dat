25|$|At {{the rise}} of the curtain, peasants, {{shepherd}}s and shepherdesses come to rest on the grass after their toil. Among them is a shepherd called Gyges, who plays on his pipe and induces the company to dance. Near him is his betrothed, Clytia, who <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> tenderly. Gradually the light fades. The peasants look fearfully at the cave and take their departure. Night falls.|$|E
25|$|After {{being called}} Kid Apocalypse by Kid Omega, Evan begins {{learning}} about Apocalypse and is saddened {{that he himself}} looks like the villain, raising {{the possibility of a}} future that Evan rejects. After saving Angel and discovering that he possesses the ability to see the essence of those he looks upon, Evan asks him to tell him what he sees when he <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Angel tells En he sees only goodness inside him, which makes Evan happy, so he thanks Angel for being a good friend. In fact, Angel lied, as the only thing he could see was the dark image of Apocalypse.|$|E
25|$|Michigan J. Frog, {{featured}} in a Warner Brothers cartoon, only performs his singing and dancing routine for his owner. Once another person <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> he returns to a frog-like pose, and begins calling. Slippy Toad, a character from the Star Fox series of video games, is a talented mechanic, but mediocre pilot, who often ends up needing to be rescued by his teammates. Kermit the Frog, on the other hand, is a conscientious and disciplined character of Sesame Street and The Muppet Show; while openly friendly and greatly talented, he is often portrayed as cringing at the fanciful behaviour of more flamboyant characters.|$|E

60|$|The {{silence of}} that minute was horrible to Undy, {{and yet he}} could hardly bring himself to break it. The judge <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with eyes which seemed to read his inmost soul; the jury <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> condemning him one and all; Alaric <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with fierce, glaring eyes of hatred, the same eyes that had glared <b>at</b> <b>him</b> that night {{when he had been}} {{collared}} in the street; the whole crowd <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> derisively; but the eyes of them all were as nothing to the eyes of Mr. Chaffanbrass.|$|R
25|$|The {{next day}} Lizaveta Prokofyevna {{and her daughters}} visit Myshkin to check on his health and assure him of their friendship. They are {{followed}} by Ippolit, who informs the Prince that he and others (such as Lebedyev and Ganya) have been intriguing against him, and have been unsettling Aglaya with talk of Nastassya Filippovna. Ippolit has arranged, at Aglaya'a request and with Rogozhin's help, a meeting between the two women. That evening Aglaya, having left her home in secret, calls for the Prince. They proceed in silence to the appointed meeting place, where Nastassya Filippovna waits for Aglaya to begin. It soon becomes apparent that Aglaya has not come there to discuss anything, but to chastise and humiliate Nastassya Filippovna. Nastassya Filippovna responds in kind and a bitter exchange of accusations and insults ensues. Nastassya Filippovna orders Rogozhin to leave and hysterically demands of Myshkin that he stay with her. Myshkin, once again torn by her suffering, is unable to deny her and reproaches Aglaya for her attack. Aglaya <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with pain and hatred, and runs off. He goes after her but Nastassya Filippovna stops him desperately and then faints. Myshkin stays with her.|$|E
25|$|From time to time, {{the link}} between the Crown and Aboriginal peoples will be symbolically expressed, through pow-wows or other types of {{ceremony}} held to mark the anniversary of a particular treaty — sometimes with the participation of the monarch, another member of the Canadian Royal Family, or one of the Sovereign's representatives—or simply an occasion mounted to coincide with the presence of a member of the Royal Family on a royal tour, Aboriginals having always been a part of such tours of Canada. Gifts have been frequently exchanged and Aboriginal titles have been bestowed upon royal and viceregal figures {{since the early days of}} indigenous contact with the Crown: The Ojibwa referred to King George III as the Great Father and Queen Victoria was later dubbed as the Great White Mother. Queen Elizabeth II was named Mother of all People by the Salish nation in 1959 and her son, Prince Charles, was in 1976 given by the Inuit the title of Attaniout Ikeneego, meaning Son of the Big Boss. Charles was further honoured in 1986, when Cree and Ojibwa students in Winnipeg named Charles Leading Star, and again in 2001, during the Prince's first visit to Saskatchewan, when he was named Pisimwa Kamiwohkitahpamikohk, or The Sun <b>Looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>Him</b> in a Good Way, by an elder in a ceremony at Wanuskewin Heritage Park.|$|E

500|$|Female emus {{court the}} males; the female's plumage darkens {{slightly}} {{and the small}} patches of bare, featherless skin just below the eyes and near the beak turn turquoise-blue. The colour of the male's plumage remains unchanged, although the bare patches of skin also turn light blue. [...] When courting, females stride around, pulling their neck back while puffing out their feathers and emitting low, monosyllabic calls that have been compared to drum beats. This calling can occur when males are out of sight or more than [...] away. [...] Once the male's attention has been gained, the female circles her prospective mate {{at a distance of}} [...] As she does this, she <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> by turning her neck, {{while at the same time}} keeping her rump facing towards him. If the male shows interest in the parading female, he will move closer; the female continues the courtship by shuffling further away but continuing to circle him.|$|E
2500|$|In The Phantom Menace, Portman had {{to portray}} a {{character}} younger than herself. In Attack of the Clones, however, her character had aged 10 years.

2500|$|The {{historian}} Gordon S. Wood {{says that}} Lance Banning, {{as in his}} Sacred Fire of Liberty (1995), is the [...] "only present-day scholar to maintain that Madison did not change his views in the 1790s." [...] In claiming this, Banning downplays Madison's nationalism in the 1780s. Wood notes that many historians struggle to understand Madison, but Wood <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{in the terms of}} Madison's own times—as a nationalist but one with a different conception of nationalism from that of the Federalists. He wanted to avoid a European-style government and always thought that the embargo would ultimately have been successful. Thus, Wood assesses Madison from a different point of view. Gary Rosen and Banning use other approaches to suggest Madison's consistency.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, {{he played}} {{co-pilot}} Roger Murdock in Airplane!. Abdul-Jabbar has {{a scene in}} which a little boy <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and remarks that he is in fact Abdul-Jabbar—spoofing the appearance of football star Elroy [...] "Crazylegs" [...] Hirsch as an airplane pilot in the 1957 drama that served as the inspiration for Airplane!, Zero Hour!. Staying in character, Abdul-Jabbar states that he is merely Roger Murdock, an airline co-pilot, but the boy continues to insist that Abdul-Jabbar is [...] "the greatest", but that, according to his father, he doesn't [...] "work hard on defense" [...] and [...] "never really tries, except during the playoffs". This causes Abdul-Jabbar's character to snap, [...] "The hell I don't!", then grab the boy and snarl he has [...] " [...] that crap ever since ... UCLA", he [...] "busts his buns every night" [...] and the boy should tell his [...] "old man to drag [...] Walton and [...] Lanier up and down the court for 48 minutes". When Murdock loses consciousness later in the film, he collapses at the controls wearing Abdul-Jabbar's goggles and yellow Lakers' shorts.|$|E
2500|$|Female protagonists in aggressively sexual vice {{films were}} usually of two general kinds: the bad girl or the fallen woman. In {{so-called}} [...] "bad girl" [...] pictures, female characters profit from promiscuity and immoral behavior. Jean Harlow, an actress who was by all reports a lighthearted, kind person off the screen, frequently played bad girl characters and dubbed them [...] "sex vultures". Two {{of the most}} prominent examples of bad girl films were Red-Headed Woman (1932) and Baby Face (1933). In Red-Headed Woman, Jean Harlow plays a secretary determined to sleep her way into a more luxurious lifestyle. She seduces her boss and intentionally breaks up his marriage. During her seductions, he tries to resist and slaps her, at which point she <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> deliriously and replies [...] "Do it again, I like it! Do it again!" [...] They eventually marry but Harlow seduces a wealthy aged industrialist who is in business with her husband so that she can move to New York. Although this plan succeeds, she is cast aside when she is discovered having an affair with her chauffeur, in essence cheating on her paramour. Harlow shoots the original boss, nearly killing him. When she is last seen in the film, she is in France {{in the back seat of}} a limousine with an elderly wealthy gentleman being driven along by the same chauffeur. The film was a boon to Harlow's career and has been described as a [...] "trash masterpiece." [...] Similarly, in Baby Face Barbara Stanwyck is an abused runaway determined to use sex to advance herself financially and sleeps her way to the top of Gotham Trust. Her progress is illustrated in a recurring visual metaphor of the movie camera panning ever upward along the front of Gotham Trust's skyscraper. Men are driven mad with lust over her and they commit murder, attempt suicide, and are ruined financially for associating with her before she mends her ways in the final reel. In another departure from post-code films, Stanwyck's sole companion for the duration of the picture is a black woman named Chico she took with her when she ran away from home at age 14.|$|E
