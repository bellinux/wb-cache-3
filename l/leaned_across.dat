500|$|Those still {{conscious}} at {{that point}} might have seen their entrails burned, before their heart was removed and the body decapitated and quartered (chopped into four pieces). [...] The regicide Major-General Thomas Harrison, after being hanged for several minutes and then cut open in October 1660, {{was reported to have}} <b>leaned</b> <b>across</b> and hit his executioner—resulting in the swift removal of his head. [...] His entrails were thrown onto a nearby fire. [...] John Houghton was reported to have prayed while being disembowelled in 1535, and in his final moments to have cried [...] "Good Jesu, what will you do with my heart?"

[...] In 1584 Richard White's executioner removed his bowels piece by piece, through a small hole in his belly, [...] "the which device taking no good success, he mangled his breast with a butcher's axe to the very chine most pitifully". [...] At his execution in January 1606 for his involvement in the Gunpowder Plot, Guy Fawkes managed to break his neck by jumping from the gallows, cheating the executioner.|$|E
2500|$|One Friday {{evening in}} March, 1980, Bonin offered a 17-year-old named William Ray Pugh {{a ride home}} as the pair left the house of Everett Fraser. Within minutes of {{accepting}} the ride, Bonin asked Pugh whether {{he would like to}} engage in sex with him. Pugh later stated he panicked and stuttered upon hearing this question and, after sitting in silence for several minutes, attempted to leave the vehicle once Bonin had slowed the van at a stoplight. In response, Bonin wordlessly <b>leaned</b> <b>across</b> and grabbed Pugh by the collar, dragging him back into the passenger seat. According to Pugh, Bonin then confided in him that he enjoyed abducting young male hitchhikers on Friday and Saturday nights, whom he then restrained and abused before strangling them to death with their own T-shirts. In a matter-of-fact tone, Bonin then informed Pugh: [...] "If you want to kill somebody, you should make a plan and find a place to dump the body before you even pick a victim." [...] Bonin then informed Pugh he had not chosen to refrain from assaulting and killing him out of sentiment; he'd been spared because the pair had been seen leaving Fraser's party together.|$|E

50|$|In {{woodworking}} {{the term}} circular saw is {{most commonly used}} to refer to a hand-held, electric circular saw designed for cutting wood, but may be used for cutting other materials with different blades. Circular saws can be either left or right-handed, depending {{on the side of the}} blade where the motor sits. A left-handed saw is typically easier to use if held in the right hand, and contrariwise for the right-handed saw, because the user does not need to <b>lean</b> <b>across</b> the saw to see the cutting line.|$|R
