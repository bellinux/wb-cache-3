Following a poor wheat crop, the Class 45s were placed in store at Junee Locomotive Depot in December 1991. A locomotive shortage saw most return to service from March 1993.

25|$|In October 2012, the <b>lead</b> <b>locomotive,</b> a GE C30-7 #5017 {{was sent}} to MMA's repair shop {{following}} an engine failure.

The locos left the Port of Wellington on 8 December 1998 on the Arktis Dream, and arrived in Bell Bay on 15 December 1998. They were still painted in the Cato Blue livery, still with Tranz Rails winged logo still painted on. The logo was later modified with [...] "Tranz Rail" [...] being replaced by [...] "Tasrail".

25|$|The MMA has {{alleged that}} the <b>lead</b> <b>locomotive</b> was {{tampered}} with after Harding had left; that the diesel engine was shut down, thereby disabling the compressor powering the air brakes, which allowed the train to roll downhill from Nantes into Lac-Mégantic once the air pressure dropped in the reservoirs on the cars. Teamsters Canada Rail Conference vice-president Doug Finnson disputed this theory, stating that the key braking system on a stopped, unsupervised train are the hand brakes, which are completely independent from the motor-powered compressor that feeds the air brakes.|$|E
25|$|Harding {{left the}} <b>lead</b> <b>locomotive</b> No.5017 running to keep air {{pressure}} supplied to the train's air brakes and also applied {{a number of}} hand brakes. Yves Bourdon, a member of MMA's Board of Directors, stated that the air brakes of all locomotives and freight cars had been activated, as well as hand brakes on 5 locomotives and 10 of the 72 freight cars. However, the TSB agrees with a July 6 statement to police by the train's engineer that he set hand brakes on just the five locomotive engines, a buffer car, and a car housing the remote control apparatus. The engineer also attempted a brake test but incorrectly left the locomotive air brakes on; this gave the false impression that the hand brakes alone would hold the train.|$|E
25|$|Air {{brakes on}} the train are {{supplied}} with air from a compressor on each locomotive. When a locomotive is shut off, the compressor no longer supplies the brake system with air. An air brake pipe connects to each car and locomotive {{on the train}}. When air leaks from the various components, the air pressure drops. If {{the system is not}} recharged with air, the locomotive air brakes will become ineffective and provide no braking force. When the air brake control valves sense a drop in pressure in the brake pipe, they are designed to activate the brakes on each car. However, if the rate of leakage is slow and steady, the automatic brakes may not be applied {{as in the case of}} the Lac-Mégantic accident. The train had locomotives that could automatically restart the air-brake system in the event of a brake failure, provided that these locomotives were not shut down as they would be. Also, the TSB found that the “reset safety control” on the <b>lead</b> <b>locomotive</b> was not wired to set the entire train’s brakes in the event of an engine failure.|$|E

50|$|As soon as {{the train}} crested {{the apex of the}} grade at Hiland and started {{downgrade}} {{on the south side of}} Cajon Pass, it became apparent to Holland at the head end that he was having trouble controlling the speed of the train. When he realized that the train was gathering too much speed, he did all he could to control the train speed using the train's air brakes and the dynamic brakes of the <b>lead</b> <b>locomotives,</b> and asked the helper engine's engineer to do as much as he could to help also, not knowing that he had only one working dynamic brake in his set. As a last attempt to stop the train, the helper engineer initiated an emergency brake application from his helper locomotive, but this ended up disabling all of the dynamic brakes on the train, allowing the train to pick up speed. After the activation of the emergency brake, the only brakes which were operational were the air brakes, which were now melting from the friction and heat. When the NTSB investigators arrived at the crash site (about twelve hours after the accident), they observed that the wheels had gotten so hot that they had started to expand off the wheel axles by the time they left the rails.|$|R
50|$|On May 12, 1989, at 7:36 a.m. a 6-locomotive/69-car Southern Pacific {{freight train}} (SP 7551 East, {{computer}} symbol 1 MJLBP-11) that was transporting trona, lost control while descending Cajon Pass, derailed on an elevated curve and plowed into a residential area on Duffy Street. The location is just northeast {{of where the}} 210 Foothill Freeway crosses the Cajon Creek wash.The conductor, head-end brakeman, and two residents {{were killed in the}} wreck. Seven houses on the street immediately next to the tracks were demolished by the wreck, as were the <b>lead</b> <b>locomotives</b> and all of the freight cars. Clerks in Mojave had miscalculated the weight of the train, while the engineer and crew at the head end were unaware that one of the rear helper engines had inoperative dynamic brakes. Hence there was not enough dynamic braking force available to maintain control of train speed during the descent. When the helper engineer realized that the train speed was not being adequately controlled, he made an emergency brake application, which deactivated dynamic braking, resulting in a runaway condition. The train reached a speed of about 100 miles per hour (mph) before derailing on an elevated 35 mph curve next to Duffy Street, sending the head end locomotives and several cars off the high railroad bed and into houses on the street below, completely demolishing them.|$|R

50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was delivered}} on 21 March 1919 {{as the first}} of the four test locomotives.

Another reason were the planned test with the electrical brake on the Lötschbergbahn. 1 September 1919 the locomotive was officially taken over by the SBB. This was followed by services in commuter trains to Spiez and partly to Brig too. After a break in 1920, the <b>locomotive</b> <b>lead</b> trains in planned services together with the Be 4/6 12303-12342 - which were in the delivery phase - over the Lötschberg railway line until Brig.|$|R
