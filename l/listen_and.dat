This paper starts from the basic theory of “cooperative” teaching mode, and then analyzes the status quo of academic English <b>listening</b> <b>and</b> speaking in regular colleges, and finally carries out comparative analysis by the use of fuzzy mathematics method based on the traditional <b>listening</b> <b>and</b> speaking English teaching mode <b>and</b> cooperative <b>listening</b> <b>and</b> speaking English teaching mode and other methods, and finally concludes the main trend of future development of the cooperative <b>listening</b> <b>and</b> speaking English teaching mode...|$|R

The focus of the present study was to explore Bangladesh secondary English teachers’ understandings about <b>listening</b> <b>and</b> speaking skills assessment as well as to learn the barriers and enablers they encounter in assessing those two skills. The study showed that the Bangladesh secondary English curriculum does not include the assessment of <b>listening</b> <b>and</b> speaking skills, although the curriculum document gives a mandate to teachers to practise and assess all the four language skills – <b>listening,</b> speaking, reading, <b>and</b> writing. The study also indicated that teachers taught English mixing with Bangla language; they had not been trained to assess <b>listening</b> <b>and</b> speaking skills; the English curriculum required restructuring to make way for <b>listening</b> <b>and</b> speaking skills assessment; teachers needed <b>listening</b> <b>and</b> speaking resources to enable them to undertake both <b>listening</b> <b>and</b> speaking practices and assessment; and above all, it shows that the teachers need instruction from the education authority in order to start auraloral skills assessment in schools.

However, Sue is perhaps the least suited person for the job; she is mean-spirited, insensitive, unsympathetic, controlling and vain. Her office is a place where the impossible tends to happen, and anyone who enters is normally treated with a mixture of verbal abuse and psychological torture, so she can get back to doing nothing, or thinking about how to upset the next visitor. The only person she treats with any affection is Mac, whom she loves to the point of madness, but Mac, like almost everyone else, tries his best to avoid her. Anyone who attempts to get involved with Mac is treated with contempt and hatred by Sue, in particular Caroline, whom Sue attempts several times to murder.|$|E

They then confront Apu {{and he says he}} will break up with the Squishee Lady named Annette. However, he breaks his promise (as it gets his mind off the octuplets and she forces him). Later, Manjula watches the surveillance footage of Apu cheating and kicks him out.

5|$|Heading into Bound for Glory IV, TNA {{created a}} {{company-wide}} narrative {{that led to}} an on-screen rivalry between professional wrestling veterans, who played the villains, and the younger talent of the company, who played the heroic characters. Several matches and storylines {{that led to the}} event were connected to this narrative, such as the storyline surrounding the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and the bout pitting Kurt Angle against Jeff Jarrett. This narrative started at TNA's Victory Road PPV event on July13, where Samoa Joe defended the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against Booker T. During the match, Joe relentlessly assaulted Booker T to the point that referees nor security could stop him. This led to Sting interfering in the contest trying to calm Joe down. Joe refused to <b>listen</b> <b>and</b> continued his assault, causing Sting to hit Joe in the stomach with a baseball in order for Joe to stop, resulting in a no contest. Sting did not state a reason as to why he hit Joe in the weeks after the event. At TNA's Hard Justice PPV event on August10, A.J. Styles fought Angle in a Last Man Standing match, which he won after injuring Angle's neck in the contest. After the bout, Styles attacked Angle's injured neck, making the injury more severe in the storyline until Sting attacked Styles to prevent the assault from continuing. On the August14 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!, Sting explained that both Joe and Styles had been disrespectful and violent in their current rivalries and matches. He stated that his actions were to end that type of behavior between the younger wrestlers and the veteran wrestlers.|$|E

To shed more light on this issue, {{the present study was}} conducted to compare the effect of jigsaw and decision-making tasks on improving <b>listening</b> <b>and</b> speaking abilities of EFL learners. To this end, 75 female Iranian EFL learners, assumed homogenous based on their performance on the Nelson Test, were employed as the participants.

The experimental group A received decision-making-based <b>listening</b> <b>and</b> speaking instruction for 12 sessions of 45 minutes, and the experimental group B received jigsaw-based <b>listening</b> <b>and</b> speaking instruction. In order to analyze the data, descriptive statistics and multiple inferential statistical analyses were conducted.
