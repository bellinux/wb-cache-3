40|$|Abstract. To avoid data races, {{concurrent}} operations should {{either be}} at distinct times or on distinct data. Atomicity is the abstraction that an operation takes effect at a single, discrete instant in time, with lin-earisability being a well-known correctness condition which asserts that concurrent operations appear to behave atomically. Disjointness is the abstraction that operations act on distinct data resource, with concur-rent separation logics enabling reasoning about threads {{that appear to}} operate independently on disjoint resources. Building on separation logic with concurrent abstract predicates (CAP), we introduce TaDA, a program logic which combines the benefits of ab-stract atomicity and abstract disjointness. We give several examples: an atomic <b>lock</b> <b>module,</b> a CAP example with a twist, which cannot be done using linearisability; an atomic MCAS module implemented using our <b>lock</b> <b>module,</b> a classic linearisability example which cannot be done us-ing CAP; and a double-ended queue module implemented using MCAS. ...|$|R
30|$|Chemical {{transfer}} via RF saturation is {{a classic}} and commonly practiced method for chemical exchange, however, {{is not the only}} way. Another often used approach, sometimes referred as on-resonance saturation, is chemical exchange spin lock (CESL), which employs a spin <b>lock</b> <b>module</b> similar to that used in T 1 -rho imaging [36 – 38]. Similar to CEST, CESL can also be performed off-resonant providing an attractive feature that is the freedom to use higher RF power while avoiding increased levels of direct water saturation. This feature is particularly beneficial for imaging agents with smaller chemical shifts, as reviewed systematically in [34, 36].|$|R

Cartridges were envisioned to be a primary medium for software distribution on the Mindset, but sales of the system were too low for cartridges to be economical, and software was distributed on disk instead.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. An {{efficient}} {{method for}} GPS multipath mitiga-tion is proposed. The motivation for this proposed {{method is to}} integrate the Teager-Kaiser Operator (TKO) with the Multipath Estimating Delay <b>Lock</b> Loop (MEDLL) <b>module</b> to mitigate the GPS multipath efficiently. The general im-plementation process of the proposed method is that we first utilize the TKO to operate on the received signal’s Auto-Correlation Function (ACF) to get an initial estimate of the multipaths. Then we transfer the initial estimated results to the MEDLL module for a further estimation. Finally, with a few iterations which are less {{than those of the}} original MEDLL algorithm, we can get a more accu-rate estimate of the Line-Of-Sight (LOS) signal, and thus the goal of the GPS multipath mitigation is achieved. The simulation results show that compared to the original MEDLL algorithm, the proposed method can reduce the computation load and the hardware and/or software con-sumption of the MEDLL module, meanwhile, without de-creasing the algorithm accuracy...|$|R

40|$|Biochemical and {{regulatory}} interactions central to biological networks {{are expected to}} cause extensive genetic interactions or epistasis affecting the heritability of complex traits {{and the distribution of}} genotypes in populations. However, the inference of epistasis from the observed phenotype-genotype correlation is impeded by statistical difficulties, while the theoretical understanding of the effects of epistasis remains limited, in turn limiting our ability to interpret data. Of particular interest is the biologically relevant situation of numerous interacting genetic loci with small individual contributions to fitness. Here, we present a computational model of selection dynamics involving many epistatic loci in a recombining population. We demonstrate {{that a large number of}} polymorphic interacting loci can, despite frequent recombination, exhibit cooperative behavior that locks alleles into favorable genotypes leading to a population consisting of a set of competing clones. When the recombination rate exceeds a certain critical value that depends on the strength of epistasis, this "genotype selection" regime disappears in an abrupt transition, giving way to "allele selection" [...] the regime where different loci are only weakly correlated as expected in sexually reproducing populations. We show that large populations attain highest fitness at a recombination rate just below critical. Clustering of interacting sets of genes on a chromosome leads to the emergence of an intermediate regime, where blocks of cooperating alleles <b>lock</b> into genetic <b>modules.</b> These haplotype blocks disappear in a second transition to pure allele selection. Our results demonstrate that the collective effect of many weak epistatic interactions can have dramatic effects on the population structure...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{development}} and practical assessment of a contemporary Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) controller for grid-tied converters. The increasing popularity of renewable energy resources necessitates intelligent power converters to interface with utility network. The proposed control methodology can effectively regulate converter powers/currents under highly unbalanced voltage conditions. The methodology can be easily applied to rotating electrical machines that have similar dynamic models. A LPV model of grid-tied converter with filters are derived in synchronous positive and negative rotating frames and a detailed controller design procedure is then carried out using Matrix Linear Inequality technique. The proposed controller uses network frequency as a reference {{and it has the}} capability to handle the system frequency variations. Off-line controller design stage is computed by Matlab software while on-line controller calculations are dealt by a Digital Signal Processor (DSP). The highly distorted voltage at the point of common coupling between Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) and utility network may degrade the outputs of the phase <b>locked</b> loop (PLL) <b>module</b> and overall controller performance. An enhanced version of PLL technique is proposed to overcome the voltage distortions and a significant reduction of Total Harmonic Distortion has been recorded. The harmonic issue is successfully treated further with an additional harmonic observer supporting the main controller. To verify the proposed control approach, studies are carried out using Matlab/SIMULINK platform with the code-based simulation. This simulation method can ensure the results close to a real DSP system and enables the user to transfer the simulation studies effectively to the experimental setup without major modifications. A prototype of a three phase VSI with a DSP controller is then investigated using dSPACE DS 1104 development board. Experimental results from this system validate the proposed control technique and its benefits...|$|R
