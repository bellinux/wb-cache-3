5|$|At 06:00, {{a breeze}} pushed Boadicea forward {{and she began}} to close with her former consort, Rowley {{watching}} as all three of Africaines masts gave way and collapsed over the side one by one. By 08:00, Africaine was a dismasted hull and Corbet was dead {{in the bowels of the}} ship, although the exact manner of his death was to cause lasting controversy. By 10:00, Boadicea had been joined by Otter and Staunch and bore down on the French ships and their prize, so that by 15:30 Bouvet was persuaded to abandon Africaine and tow the damaged Iphigénie back to Port Napoleon. By 17:00, Boadicea pulled alongside Africaine and the French prize crew surrendered. Rowley later reported that a number of British sailors <b>leaped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sea at his approach and swam to Boadicea, requesting that they be allowed to pursue the French ships in the hope of capturing one.|$|E
25|$|According to some colonial Mayan sources (e.g., the Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel), Hunac Ceel, {{ruler of}} Mayapan, conquered Chichen Itza in the 13th century. Hunac Ceel {{supposedly}} prophesied his own rise to power. According to custom at the time, individuals {{thrown into the}} Cenote Sagrado were believed to have the power of prophecy if they survived. During one such ceremony, the chronicles state, there were no survivors, so Hunac Ceel <b>leaped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Cenote Sagrado, and when removed, prophesied his own ascension.|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} of 1777, Philippe Charles Tronson du Coudray, a French {{artillery}} expert, arrived from France. Congress appointed him a major general and inspector general of ordnance, and Washington assigned him the task of strengthening Philadelphia's river defenses. His aristocratic airs soon irritated people. He began to quarrel with another French military engineer, Louis Lebègue Duportail, about how the defenses were to be prepared and even managed to anger Gilbert Motier, marquis de La Fayette. To the relief of many, Coudray drowned on September 16 after he foolishly rode his horse onto a Schuylkill ferry and the animal <b>leaped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> river.|$|E

25|$|Still in his sailor's deck shoes, Richard <b>leaped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sea and waded {{through the}} waves {{to reach the}} beach. The King again showed his {{personal}} bravery and martial prowess, leading fifty-four knights, a few hundred infantrymen, and about 2,000 Genoese and Pisan crossbowmen into battle. The Muslim army began to panic at the sudden offensive launched by Richard's newly arrived force; they feared it was but a spearhead {{of a much larger}} army coming to relieve Jaffa. The English king fought in person at the forefront of his attack, and Saladin's men were routed. Many of the Christian prisoners who had surrendered earlier also seized their arms and resumed combat, for their captors were in such disarray that they were unable to stop them. Saladin's fleeing army spilled out of Jaffa and escaped in a disorderly manner; Saladin was unable to regroup his forces until they had retreated more than five miles inland.|$|E
25|$|On 8 June 1944, the 3rd Battalion of the 116th Infantry was {{advancing}} on the strongly held German defenses at Grandcamp-Maisy, France, {{when the}} leading elements were suddenly halted by decimating machine gun fire from a firmly entrenched enemy {{force on the}} high ground overlooking the town. After numerous attempts to neutralize the enemy position by supporting artillery and tank fire had proved ineffective, T/Sgt. Peregory, on his own initiative, advanced up the hill under withering fire, and worked {{his way to the}} crest where he discovered an entrenchment leading to the main enemy fortifications 200 yards away. Without hesitating, he <b>leaped</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> trench and moved toward the emplacement. Encountering a squad of enemy riflemen, he fearlessly attacked them with hand grenades and bayonet, killed 8 and forced 3 to surrender. Continuing along the trench, he single-handedly forced the surrender of 32 more riflemen, captured the machine gunners, and opened the way for the leading elements of the battalion to advance and secure its objective. The extraordinary gallantry and aggressiveness displayed by T/Sgt. Peregory are exemplary of the highest tradition of the armed forces.|$|E
