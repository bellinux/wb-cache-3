5|$|On 9 October, Banksy {{unveiled}} one of {{the more}} elaborate and politically strong pieces of the series. It featured armed soldiers and horses spray-painted on a car and trailer in an empty <b>lot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lower East Side. Instead of commentary about the work, the accompanying audio was that of a classified video from the July 12, 2007 Baghdad airstrike. After being dismantled, the car was towed away to prevent further defacement.|$|E
5|$|Fodor {{argues that}} mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are {{relations}} between individuals and mental representations. He maintains that these representations {{can only be}} correctly {{explained in terms of}} a language of thought (<b>LOT)</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mind. Furthermore, this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified in the brain and not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adheres to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{believe that}} as many as 256 {{soldiers}} of the First Maryland Regiment under Colonel William Smallwood fell in the battle, about two-thirds of the regiment. It is known that they were buried in a mass-grave, but the grave's exact location has been a mystery for 240 years. In 2012 Brooklyn historian and president of the Brooklyn Preservation Council, Robert Furman, stated that he had a strong suspicion of the location of the gravesite, believing it to be in an empty <b>lot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gowanus section of Brooklyn.|$|E
5|$|MD 300 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with MD 213 (Church Hill Road) {{in the northern}} part of the town of Church Hill. The highway heads east as two-lane Sudlersville Road and intersects MD 19 (Main Street) before leaving the town. The state highway heads northeast and intersects US 301 (Blue Star Memorial Highway) at a superstreet intersection next to a park and ride <b>lot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southwest quadrant. Traffic on MD 300 is required to turn right onto US 301, perform a U-turn, then turn right again to continue on MD 300. The highway curves east at Dudley Corners, where the route crosses Red Lion Branch and meets the southern end of MD 290 (Dudley Corner Road) and the north end of Benton Corners Road, which leads to the historic Dudley's Chapel.|$|E

Doc demonstrates the time navigation system by punching in the date November 5, 1955: the day he invented time travel. A moment later, the Libyans arrive and shoot Doc. Marty escapes in the DeLorean, but inadvertently activates the time machine, and arrives in 1955 without enough plutonium to return.|$|E

5|$|At Aliso Beach, {{the mouth}} of Aliso Creek, lies a {{freshwater}} pond that changes frequently in elevation and extent. Tidal activity at the creek's mouth results in sediment building gradually up into a sandbar, impounding it in a small lake about 0.2 miles (0.3km) long at its fullest extent. Afterwards, the water level rises upstream of the sandbar until one of two factors causes it to breach: either waves at high tide wash away {{the top of the}} sandbar, or the lagoon rises enough to overtop the sandbar by itself. Once the water level rises above the sandbar, rapid erosion quickly cuts through the sand and drains the approximately 3–5-foot (0.9–1.5 m)-deep lake in a matter of minutes. Peak flows through the sandbar can reach , even if the incoming flow of the creek is nowhere near that size. Because of the raised flow of the creek and the construction of a parking <b>lot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lagoon area since the 1960s, the lagoon has never been able to fill to its much larger, historic extent without breaching. Species such as the tidewater goby have suffered because of loss of their habitat this way.|$|E
5|$|In the 1792 constitution, the {{governor}} and state senators were chosen by electors, {{in a manner similar}} to the operation of the United States Electoral College. In the 1795 gubernatorial election, Benjamin Logan received 21 electoral votes, James Garrard received 17, Thomas Todd received 14, and John Brown received 1. The constitution did not specify whether election required a plurality or a majority of the electoral votes cast; in the absence of any instruction, the electors held a runoff vote, wherein most of Todd's electors voted for Garrard, giving him a majority. The secretary of state certified Garrard's election, though Attorney General John Breckinridge questioned the legality of the second vote and Logan formally protested it. Ultimately, Breckinridge determined that he was not empowered by the state constitution to intervene, and Logan gave up the challenge. The 1799 constitution changed the method of selecting {{the governor}} to direct election by majority vote and prescribed that, in the event of a tie vote, the governor would be chosen by <b>lot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Kentucky General Assembly. This provision has remained since 1799.|$|E

25|$|Novy Peterburg (Goloday Island development) {{was a huge}} Palladian fantasy. In 1911, a British {{investment}} company launched a development project on a 1 square kilometer <b>lot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> western Goloday Island, awarding general planning to Fomin. Building design was split between Fomin and Fyodor Lidval. Fomin wanted to recreate the monumental imperial classics in a middle class community. Only a fraction of his plan materialized before World War I. One building, a school on Kakhovsky Street, stands today.|$|E
25|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Depression in 1929, {{building}} in the area slowed, but in 1934, as the FHA made credit more available, construction again resumed, and another growth spurt in the neighborhood occurred in the late 1930s and early 1940s. By the 1950s, there was a house on nearly every <b>lot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neighborhood. In the later part of the century, as the population in Detroit declined, Rosedale Park has remained a desirable neighborhood due to its high grade housing stock, charming setting and active neighborhood association.|$|E

25|$|Architecturally speaking, the Armstrong-Toro Residence is {{significant}} {{in the history of}} Ponce because it is one of Domenech's most distinguished eclectic designs and probably the best known. Its unique caryatid-framed main entrance, its intricate ornamental details and its location upon the most prominent <b>lot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city of Ponce (across from the Cathedral and public plaza) have made this house a true architectural landmark in the city's traditional urban core. As a result, many houses were built during the early 20th century with similar elements in a similar vocabulary, contributing to the unique historic district of Ponce.|$|E
25|$|Stojan Simić, a {{politician}} and a businessman, {{member of the}} influential , notable in the 19th century Serbia both in politics and culture, purchased the <b>lot</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1830s.

Simić drained the marsh, filled and leveled the terrain and on the northern side of the modern Kralja Milana street constructed a house 1840-42. The edifice became known as the Old Konak. Development of the first Serbian royal compound began in 1843-43, when the ruling prince Alexander Karađorđević purchased the konak with the surrounding garden.|$|E
