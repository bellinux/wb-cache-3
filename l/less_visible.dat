5|$|Animal {{coloration}} is {{the general}} appearance of an animal resulting from the reflection or emission of light from its surfaces. Some animals are brightly coloured, while others are hard to see. In some species, such as the peafowl, the male has strong patterns, conspicuous colours and is iridescent, while the female is far <b>less</b> <b>visible.</b>|$|E
5|$|Animals {{that are}} most active at dawn and dusk, when {{temperatures}} are cooler than mid-day, are called crepuscular. The subdued morning and evening light helps make them <b>less</b> <b>visible</b> to predators, but is bright enough {{to allow them to}} locate food. Some animals are crepuscular mainly because their prey is. Crepuscular animals in the area include mule deer, coyotes, porcupines, mountain cottontails, jackrabbits, and many songbirds.|$|E

5|$|Adams did {{not speak}} French, the {{international}} language of diplomacy at the time. He therefore assumed a <b>less</b> <b>visible</b> role, but emerged as the commission's chief administrator, imposing order and methods lacking in his delegation's finances and record-keeping affairs. His first stay in Europe, between April 1, 1778, and June 17, 1779, was otherwise unremarkable, and {{he returned to his}} home in Braintree in early August 1779. Back home, Adams became one of the founders and charter members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1780.|$|E
5|$|Animals produce colour in {{different}} ways. Pigments are particles of coloured material. Chromatophores are cells containing pigment, which can change their size {{to make their}} colour more or <b>less</b> <b>visible.</b> Some animals, including many butterflies and birds, have microscopic structures in scales, bristles or feathers which give them brilliant iridescent colours. Other animals including squid and some deep-sea fish can produce light, sometimes of different colours. Animals often use {{two or more of}} these mechanisms together to produce the colours and effects they need.|$|E
50|$|Visible light {{includes}} radiation with wavelengths between 400 nm and 700 nm, {{meaning that}} far infrared photons have <b>less</b> energy than <b>visible</b> light photons.|$|R

Hepzibah's form, though its sable outline {{mingled with the}} dusk, was now <b>less</b> imperfectly <b>visible.</b> In the remoter parts of the room, however, its walls being so ill adapted to reflect light, there was nearly the same obscurity as before.|$|R

5|$|Mickiewicz and {{his family}} lived in {{relative}} poverty, their major source of income being occasional publication of his work – not a very profitable endeavor. They received support from friends and patrons, {{but not enough to}} substantially change their situation. Despite spending most of his remaining years in France, Mickiewicz would never receive French citizenship, nor any support from the French government. By the late 1830s he was less active as a writer, and also <b>less</b> <b>visible</b> on the Polish émigré political scene.|$|E
5|$|Oil-fired {{propulsion}} {{had many}} advantages for naval architects and officers at sea alike. It reduced smoke, making ships <b>less</b> <b>visible.</b> It could be fed into boilers automatically, rather than needing a complement of stokers {{to do it}} by hand. Oil has roughly twice the thermal content of coal. This meant that the boilers themselves could be smaller; and for the same volume of fuel, an oil-fired ship would have much greater range.|$|E
5|$|The crew took {{advantage}} of both natural and practical light at filming locations. The director sought various approaches to the lighting setups, for example choosing several urban locations for the city lights' effects on the shots' backgrounds. He and the crew also embraced fluorescent lighting at other practical locations to maintain an element of reality and to light the prostheses depicting the characters' injuries. On the other hand, Fincher also ensured that scenes were not so strongly lit so the characters' eyes were <b>less</b> <b>visible,</b> citing cinematographer Gordon Willis' technique as the influence.|$|E

It is today known as [...] , {{formerly}} also Unteres Schloss (lower castle) to distinguish it from the Oberes Schloss or Oberschloss (upper castle). All that remains of this structure is a mound, later planted with trees.|$|R

50|$|Lagria hirta {{can reach}} {{a length of}} 7 - 8 mm. These beetles have a soft body and a head and thorax brown or black. The {{relatively}} elongated elytra are yellowish-brown and covered by dense fine light hairs. The {{rest of the body}} is also hairy, but they are <b>less</b> clearly <b>visible.</b> Antennae, underside of body and legs are black. The eyes are remarkably large and round.|$|R
5|$|The tree {{previously}} {{dominated the}} valley's farmed and grazed land, {{due to its}} height and full foliage, and was visible from a long distance, as is shown in old photographs. However, much of the surrounding land has now {{been taken over by}} forest, and Pi de les Tres Branques now has many other trees in its vicinity, which, together with its current skeletal form, make it much <b>less</b> <b>visible</b> than before.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of military camouflage {{was driven by}} the increasing range and accuracy of infantry firearms in the 19th century. In particular {{the replacement of the}} inaccurate musket with weapons such as the Baker rifle made personal concealment in battle essential. Two Napoleonic War skirmishing units of the British Army, the 95th Rifle Regiment and the 60th Rifle Regiment, were the first to adopt camouflage {{in the form of a}} rifle green jacket, while the Line regiments continued to wear scarlet tunics. A contemporary study in 1800 by the English artist and soldier Charles Hamilton Smith provided evidence that grey uniforms were <b>less</b> <b>visible</b> than green ones at a range of 150 yards.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the Palladian country house {{in the seventeenth century}} separated the family of the householder from the servants. Previously sharing the hall, and bedding down at a master's feet, or door, servants were now given separate small chambers. Sometimes these were placed on a mezzanine floor, as at Kinross. Servants were <b>less</b> <b>visible,</b> using backstairs that kept them away from members of the family and guests and they fulfilled necessary and sometimes unpleasant tasks. They were also fewer in number, of lower social status and predominately female. A country house could have 10 to 20 servants and large houses had more. A hierarchy of positions developed from the butler and housekeeper to footmen and maids. The sexes were increasingly segregated into their own quarters.|$|E
25|$|Before 1950 {{clusters}} of villages centered on small market towns that linked {{them to the}} wider economy and society. Most peasants {{were only a few}} hours' walk or less from a market town, which provided not only opportunities to buy and sell but also opportunities for entertainment, information, social life, and a host of specialized services. The villages around a market formed a social unit that, although <b>less</b> immediately <b>visible</b> than the villages, was equally significant.|$|R

5|$|The {{clitoral}} glans doubles {{in diameter}} upon arousal, and, upon further stimulation, it becomes <b>less</b> <b>visible</b> {{as it is}} covered by the swelling of tissues of the clitoral hood. The swelling protects the glans from direct contact, as direct contact at this stage can be more irritating than pleasurable. Vasocongestion eventually triggers a muscular reflex, which expels the blood that was trapped in surrounding tissues, and leads to an orgasm. A short time after stimulation has stopped, especially if orgasm has been achieved, the glans becomes visible again and returns to its normal state, with a few seconds (usually 5–10) to return to its normal position and 5–10 minutes to return to its original size. If orgasm is not achieved, the clitoris may remain engorged for a few hours, which women often find uncomfortable. Additionally, the clitoris is very sensitive after orgasm, making further stimulation initially painful for some women. Masters and Johnson documented the sexual response cycle, which has four phases and is still the clinically accepted definition of the human orgasm.|$|E
5|$|The library has {{undergone}} a number of repairs and renovations. Between 1948 and 1949, Macon was closed for a repainting, the installation of new windows, {{the addition of a}} new heater, and the removal of partitions in its reading areas. Efforts to modernize the library's interior space took place from 1973 to 1977 including an HVAC upgrade, the construction of an auditorium, and the installation of fluorescent lighting. Around 1996, the library was being rehabilitated once again, with efforts underway to improve library accessibility and the building's air conditioning system, and to install a new roof designed to mimic the original roof. The latter project was headed by the architect Leslie Defer. Macon was again renovated between 2006 and 2008 by Sen Architects. The project was intended to bring the library closer to its original appearance by making HVAC systems <b>less</b> <b>visible</b> and replacing the hanging fluorescent lights with lamps like those in the space when it opened. The renovation also included the addition of the African American Heritage Center.|$|E
5|$|The primary duty of {{the foreign}} {{ministry}} was directing the general line of Soviet foreign policy. The MER represented the country abroad and participated in talks with foreign delegations {{on behalf of the}} Soviet government. It also appointed diplomatic officers, with the exception of Soviet ambassadors, who were appointed by the Council of Ministers. The MER was responsible for taking care of the USSR's economic and political interests abroad, although economic interests were also the joint responsibility of the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The State Committee of the Council of Ministers on Cultural Links with Foreign Nations and the Ministry of Culture worked jointly with the MER in regards to the protection of Soviet citizens abroad, the exercise of overall Soviet consular relations abroad and the promotion of Soviet culture abroad. A <b>less</b> <b>visible</b> {{duty of the}} MER was its role in the coordination of Soviet intelligence operations abroad.|$|E
50|$|Interior {{alterations}} {{that resulted}} in the occasional eccentric scheme of wainscoting no doubt date from the Georgian modernisation. Where small square panel wainscoting was no longer deemed fashionable enough it was stripped out and relegated as finishes to <b>less</b> publicly <b>visible</b> rooms, such as the garrets. New schemes were also introduced, including the ‘modern’ wainscoting of the first floor study and that in situ within the kitchen chamber {{on the first floor of}} the east wing.|$|R
