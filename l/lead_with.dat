Michael Schumacher was second with 68 points, seven points ahead of Coulthard and nineteen ahead of Barrichello. Ralf Schumacher passed Fisichella for fifth place with 20 points, and Frentzen moved ahead of teammate Trulli and Salo. In the Constructors' Championship, McLaren maintained their <b>lead</b> <b>with</b> 125 points and Ferrari {{remained in}} second with 117 points. Williams increased their lead over Benetton to twelve points, and Jordan remained fifth with 13 points.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundNo {{information}} is currently {{available on the}} prognostic significance {{of the number of}} <b>leads</b> <b>with</b> fragmented QRS (fQRS). The objective {{of the study was to}} clarify the prognostic significance of the number of <b>leads</b> <b>with</b> fQRS in prior myocardial infarction (MI). Methods and resultsWe retrospectively examined 170 patients with prior MI. The primary end point was cardiac death or hospitalization for heart failure. During a mean follow-up period of 6. 4 ± 2. 9 years, 37 patients developed the primary end point. Univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses showed that age, male gender, chronic kidney disease, anterior wall MI, number of <b>leads</b> <b>with</b> fQRS, left ventricular ejection fraction, loop diuretic use, and spironolactone use were significantly associated with the primary end point. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis selected age (hazard ratio [HR] 1. 09, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 04 – 1. 14, p< 0. 001) and the number of <b>leads</b> <b>with</b> fQRS (HR 1. 33, 95 % CI 1. 11 – 1. 60, p= 0. 002) as predictors of the primary end point. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the presence of ≥ 3 <b>leads</b> <b>with</b> fQRS was most useful for distinguishing between patients with and without the primary end point. A Kaplan–Meier analysis showed a lower primary event-free rate in patients <b>with</b> ≥ 3 <b>leads</b> <b>with</b> fQRS than in those <b>with</b> < 3 <b>leads</b> <b>with</b> fQRS. ConclusionsThe number of <b>leads</b> <b>with</b> fQRS, especially the presence of ≥ 3 <b>leads</b> <b>with</b> fQRS, is an independent predictor of cardiac death or hospitalization for heart failure in patients with prior MI...|$|R

5|$|As in the {{previous}} two drives, Virginia Tech relied upon its rushing offense: The first five plays of the drive were runs by David Wilson, who gained 26 yards. The Hokies then switched gears, surprising Tennessee, whose defense allowed a 30-yard pass completion from Taylor to Boykin. Tech reverted to running plays, but Tennessee again allowed a long gain, as Roberts advanced 21 yards on a run, then Wilson ran three yards into the end zone.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the second quarter, the Hokies' defense began to stiffen. Aided by a 10-yard holding penalty against the Eagles, Matt Ryan was forced to complete a 14-yard pass on 4th-and-9 to earn a first down and keep the drive alive. Three incomplete passes followed, however, and the Eagles again settled for a field goal attempt.
