40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of doses of sewage sludge (SS) when applied for sixteen consecutive years to the Brazilian Oxisols Typic Haplothox (sandy) and Typic Eutrorthox (clayey), on the chemical characteristics of soil fertility. The experiment {{was carried out in}} a field at Jaboticabal, SP, Brazil, using experimental design in randomized blocks with 4 treatments and 5 replications. Sewage sludge was applied on soil surface and incorporated at the 0 – 10 cm depth with a <b>light</b> <b>harrow.</b> Sixty days after SS application, soil samples were collected at the depth 0 – 20 cm (10 simple samples per plot, which were mixed to obtain a composite sample). The treatments were T 1 = no SS and mineral fertilization based on soil chemical analysis, T 2 = 5...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} the depth of a compacted layer in the yields of some vegetables, in an Andisol, (Tibaitata, Sabana de Bogota) experimental plots compacted to 5, 10, 15 and 30 cm were used. Each depth resembled the compactation caused by the constant use of rotovator, <b>light</b> <b>harrow,</b> heavy harrow and disk plough, tools that are commonly used by formers in tillage operations in "La Sabana de Bogota". To test the influence of depth of compaction a split plot design experiment was used in which the main plot was the depth of compaction and the subplots the type of vegetables (cabbage, silver beet and carrots). The depth of the compacted layer had a big influence in the yields of all the tested vegetables. Assuming that the 30 cm depth of compacted layer produced 100 percent, when it was 5 cm the relative yields decreased down to 38, 32 and 22 percent for the same crops respectively, showing the negative influence of oompaction, which affects soil water storage capacity and nutrient absorption by reducing the available soil volume for rooting...|$|E
5000|$|In various {{regions of}} the United States, farmers call these {{implements}} just discs (or disks), and they reserve the word <b>harrow</b> for the <b>lighter</b> types of <b>harrow,</b> such as chain and tooth harrows. Therefore, in these regions, the phrase [...] "plowing, disking, and harrowing" [...] refers to three separate tillage steps. This is not any official distinction but is how farmers tend to speak.|$|R
50|$|The club - {{also known}} as 'Combe' - was founded by rugby fanatic Dudley E Roughton, a {{disabled}} man unable {{to play the game}} himself, making the club unique in that its founder was not an original player. In the summer of 1904 he decided to form his own team. Founding members included siblings, friends and extended family. The Church aided the formation of the club {{in the shape of the}} Rev W T Money, who played until the age of 52. Several pictures from this time are on display on the club website. The club's early results were encouraging and sometimes two or more sides turned out. Before the Great War the club shifted its headquarters several times and eventually <b>lighted</b> upon <b>Harrow</b> Field Farm, Lee.|$|R
40|$|This {{study of}} {{conditions}} making {{for the decline}} of an organization examines a col-lege from the advent of charismatic leadership (emerging in a crisis) through its routinization to the period of decline. Critical factors in its decline are revealed as: sharp discontinuaties in succession of personnel (faculty, student traits to be processed), absentee leadership and Trustees unable to give or respond to early warning signals, program innovations resisted by workers, or that workers veere incompetent to execute, external programs that siphoned resources from the par-ent organization, and conditions in the social surround that contributed to dis-ruption. The central orienting notion is that factors making for decline or death emerge {{at the intersection of}} an organization's legacy—its inherited purpose, pro-cedures, and product—and influences that pour through its permeable boundary from its social and cultural environment. This composition has a minor and a major key. There is on the one hand the astounding dechne in an organization's fortunes. On this score, like the ghost in Hamlet, I could a tale unfold whose <b>lightest</b> word Would <b>harrow</b> up thy soul, freeze thy young blood [...] . (I-v- 15). For as with any artistic or intellectual creation, it is sad and perplexing to see a social creation vandalized. But that, except incidentally, is not the tale I would unfold. Mine is a happier tale in a major key, the story of the useful insights from the lore *Presidential address delivered {{at the annual meeting of}} the Southern Sociological Society, 1985.

40|$|Clay portrays Martin Van Buren {{driven from}} the White House by nightmares of cider barrels and Whig presidential {{challenger}} William Henry Harrison. Van Buren flees the presidential mansion in his nightshirt, dropping a purse {{on the steps}} behind him. He is pursued by {{the specter of a}} winged barrel of hard cider with the head of Harrison. Van Buren speaks in quasi-Shakespearean verse: Oh I have had a dream so horrible, Twould make the wiry stubble of your head [...] Stand stiff as cabbage stalks in frozen field! Methought, whilst slumbering in my chair of state, My custom always of an afternoon, a cider barrel Rose from out the earth, and, nearly simultaneous, A horrid engine like unto a cider press; Within which press, by some invisible hand, I felt myself impelled! Oh then, methought, What pain it are to smash! and how intolerable [...] Our sufferings is! as I my vital juices did pour forth. Anon a legion of foul fiends in shape Of cider barrels, did environ me, and one, With head resembling an old hero, Screamed in my ears "Remember March the 4 th & Harrison", But ha! that form and voice again! See how he beckons me! I must absquatulate! March 4 was at that time the traditional inauguration day. For another use of the curious term "absquatulate" (also "absquabulate") see James Akin's "The Little Magician's Sleight of Hand Performance" (no. 1840 - 40). In the street Van Buren encounters two startled allies, Senators John Calhoun and Thomas Hart Benton. Calhoun exclaims, also in verse: My liege what dreadful vision has, In the lone dreary hour of night,Thus harrowed and unstrung your royal nerves? Benton, peering through his monocle, says: My liege this is the very coinage of your brain! I see no cider barrel fiend nor aught Save these few mint drops from your highness purse No doubt escaped which I within the folds of my cravat Will keep secured. The "mint drops" to which Benton refers are the coins which spill from Van Buren's purse. This is a double reference to the perennial Whig charge of corruption of the Democratic administration and to Benton's bullionist championing of hard money fiscal policy. The verse sounds Shakespearean and, given the supernatural subject matter, may allude to "MacBeth" or "Hamlet. For example, when Hamlet first meets his father's ghost in Act 1, Scene 5, the ghost says, "I could a tale unfold whose <b>lightest</b> word would <b>harrow</b> up thy soul... and each particular hair to stand an end, Like quills upon the fretful porpentine. " Based on the subject, Weitenkampf dates "Matty's Dream" 1841. The Whigs were victorious in the 1840 election but, like "Notice to Quit" (no. 1840 - 59) the print represents confident but premature hopes on the artist's part, rather than post-election gloating. As the Library's impression shows, the print was deposited for copyright on August 26, 1840. "Price 25 Cents" is printed in the margin of the print. Entered... 1848 by J. Childs.
