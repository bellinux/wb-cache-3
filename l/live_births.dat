5|$|The {{parents of}} the {{affected}} individual are typically genetically normal. The extra chromosome occurs by chance. The possibility increases from less than 0.1% in 20-year-old mothers to 3% in those age 45. There is no known behavioral activity or environmental factor that changes the possibility. Down syndrome can be identified during pregnancy by prenatal screening followed by diagnostic testing or after birth by direct observation and genetic testing. More children are born with Down syndrome in countries where abortion is not allowed and in countries where pregnancy more commonly occurs at a later age.

40|$|Background: The {{extent to}} which {{baseline}} couple characteristics affect the probability of <b>live</b> <b>birth</b> and adverse perinatal outcomes after assisted conception is unknown. Methods and Findings: We utilised the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority database to examine the predictors of <b>live</b> <b>birth</b> in all in vitro fertilisation (IVF) cycles undertaken in the UK between 2003 and 2007 (n = 144, 018). We examined the potential clinical utility of a validated model that pre-dated the introduction of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) as compared to a novel model. For those treatment cycles {{that resulted in a}} <b>live</b> singleton <b>birth</b> (n = 24, 226), we determined the associates of potential risk factors with preterm birth, low birth weight, and macrosomia. The overall rate of at least one <b>live</b> <b>birth</b> was 23. 4 per 100 cycles (95 % confidence interval [CI] 23. 2 – 23. 7). In multivariable models the odds of at least one <b>live</b> <b>birth</b> decreased with increasing maternal age, increasing duration of infertility, a greater number of previously unsuccessful IVF treatments, use of own oocytes, necessity for a second or third treatment cycle, or if it was not unexplained infertility. The association of own versus donor oocyte with reduced odds of <b>live</b> <b>birth</b> strengthened with increasing age of the mother.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess whether}} the {{estimates}} of treatment effect in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in reproductive medicine differ when either clinical pregnancy or <b>live</b> <b>birth</b> is used as the outcome measure. Design: Metaanalysis. Setting: We analyzed RCTs in reproductive medicine found in systematic reviews published in the Cochrane Library that reported on both clinical pregnancy and <b>live</b> <b>birth.</b> Patient(s) : Subfertile couples. Intervention(s) : For each individual RCT, data on clinical pregnancy and <b>live</b> <b>birth</b> were extracted. Main Outcome Measure(s) : We compared the outcome of each study by calculating a kappa-statistic (statistically significant treatment effective or not) and by comparing the odds ratio by calculating {{the ratio of the}} odds ratios (ROR). Result(s) : We found 67 systematic reviews, of which 42 reported on pregnancy and <b>live</b> <b>birth.</b> These 42 reviews included 654 RCTs, of which 143 (22 %) reported both on pregnancy and <b>live</b> <b>birth.</b> The pregnancy loss rates in the treatment and control groups were comparable. Of the 143 RCTs, the conclusion based on pregnancy rate and <b>live</b> <b>birth</b> rate was comparable (kappa value of 0. 81; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 68 - 0. 94).

Metformin should be used as a second-line drug if clomifene treatment fails. Another review recommended metformin unreservedly as a first-line treatment option because it has positive effects not only on anovulation, but also on insulin resistance, hirsutism and obesity often associated with PCOS.

5|$|Female {{cockroaches}} {{are sometimes}} seen carrying egg cases {{on the end}} of their abdomens; the German cockroach holds about 30 to 40 long, thin eggs in a case called an ootheca. She drops the capsule prior to hatching, though <b>live</b> <b>births</b> do occur in rare instances. The egg capsule may take more than five hours to lay and is initially bright white in color. The eggs are hatched from the combined pressure of the hatchlings gulping air. The hatchlings are initially bright white nymphs and continue inflating themselves with air, becoming harder and darker within about four hours. Their transient white stage while hatching and later while molting has led to claims of albino cockroaches. Development from eggs to adults takes three to four months. Cockroaches live up to a year, and the female may produce up to eight egg cases in a lifetime; in favorable conditions, she can produce 300 to 400 offspring. Other species of cockroaches, however, can produce far more eggs; in some cases a female needs to be impregnated only once to be able to lay eggs {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E
5|$|Globally, women's {{access to}} health care remains a challenge, both in {{developing}} and developed countries. In the United States, before the Affordable Health Care Act came into effect, 25% of women of child bearing age lacked health insurance. In the absence of adequate insurance, women are likely to avoid important steps to self care such as routine physical examination, screening and prevention testing, and prenatal care. The situation is aggravated by the fact that women living below the poverty line are at greater risk of unplanned pregnancy, unplanned delivery and elective abortion. Added to the financial burden in this group are poor educational achievement, lack of transportation, inflexible work schedules and difficulty obtaining child care, all of which function to create barriers to accessing health care. These problems are much worse in developing countries. Under 50% of childbirths in these countries are assisted by healthcare providers (e.g. midwives, nurses, doctors) which accounts for higher rates of maternal death, up to 1:1,000 <b>live</b> <b>births.</b> This is despite the WHO setting standards, such as a minimum of four antenatal visits.
