The MAG uses a series of proven design concepts from other successful firearms, for example the locking mechanism is modeled on that of the Browning M1918 (BAR) automatic rifle, and the feed and trigger mechanisms are from the WWII-era MG42 universal machine gun.|$|E

5000|$|In 1961, an {{optional}} locking mechanism consisting of an outer hex nut encasing a captured threaded barrel {{was added to}} the 874 line. [...] It {{can be seen in the}} photograph of a GR-900 to GR-874 adapter,. The <b>locking</b> <b>assembly</b> is not captive and can be backed off the RF connector. The threaded barrel is supplied on each connector. The threaded barrel was withdrawn into the nut on one connector and extended on the other to allow the barrel to engage the nut of both mating connectors. This style of locking mechanism was continued in GR-874's thematic successors; the GR-900 precision 14 mm connector that retains a crenelated hermaphroditic mechanical anti-spin feature to protect the sexless RF interface from rotating and galling when the locking mechanism is tightened, and the fully sexless APC-7 7 mm connector.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Aiming at rapid {{response}} to requirements of mechanical transmission products customization, {{a system for}} rapid <b>locking</b> <b>assembly</b> variant design was proposed in terms of features of <b>locking</b> <b>assembly.</b> The bases of the system are Product Configuration Model (PCM) and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). According to the system, PCM of <b>locking</b> <b>assembly</b> was built by extending traditional Generic Bill of Materials (GBOM). In addition, integration of PCM and CBR was completed by combining method of transforming PCM to a case with similarity assessment algorithm. Moreover, a rapid variant design software system based on PCM and CBR for <b>locking</b> <b>assembly</b> was developed. Finally, the software system was applied to design new <b>locking</b> <b>assembly.</b> Results demonstrate that it is effective for PCM-CBR to support {{rapid response}} to customization...|$|E

50|$|The Maschinengewehr 08 (or MG 08)—so-named after 1908, its year of adoption—was a {{development}} of the license made Maschinengewehr 01. The firing rate depends on the <b>lock</b> <b>assembly</b> used and averages 500 rounds per minute for the Schloss 08 and 600 rounds per minute for the Schloss 16. The gun used 250-round fabric belts of 7.92×57mm ammunition. Sustained firing would lead to overheating. It was water-cooled, using a jacket around the barrel that held approximately one gallon of water. Using a separate attachment sight with range calculator for indirect fire, the MG 08 could be operated from cover. Additional telescopic sights were also developed and used in quantity during the war.|$|R

40|$|Origami-inspired {{manufacturing}} {{can produce}} complex structures and machines by folding two-dimensional composites into three-dimensional structures. This fabrication technique is potentially less expensive, faster, {{and easier to}} transport than more traditional machining methods, including 3 -D printing. Self-folding enhances this method by minimizing the manual labor involved in folding, allowing for complex geometries and enabling remote or automated assembly. This paper demonstrates a novel method of self-folding hinges using shape memory polymers (SMPs), paper, and resistive circuits to achieve localized and individually addressable folding at low cost. A model for the torque exerted by these composites was developed and validated against experimental data, {{in order to determine}} design rules for selecting materials and designing hinges. Torque was shown to increase with SMP thickness, resistive circuit width, and supplied electrical current. This technique was shown to be capable of complex geometries, as well as <b>locking</b> <b>assemblies</b> with sequential folds. Its functionality and low cost make it an ideal basis for a new type of printable manufacturing based on two-dimensional fabrication techniques. ...|$|R
