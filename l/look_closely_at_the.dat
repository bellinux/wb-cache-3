I {{was so close to}} him I could see the bristles from his brushes caught in the paint; and the mucky thumbprints he'd left along his margins. The first thing that impressed me was his speed. Michelangelo worked at Schumacher pace. Adam's famous little penis was captured with a single brushstroke: a flick of the wrist, and the first man had his manhood. I also enjoyed his sense of humour, which, from close up, turned out to be refreshingly puerile. If you <b>look</b> <b>closely</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> angels who attend the scary prophetess on the Sistine ceiling known as the Cumaean Sibyl, you will see that one of them has stuck his thumb between his fingers in that mysteriously obscene gesture that visiting fans are still treated to today at Italian football matches." ...|$|E

Sergei Markov, an MP from the United Russia party, called Freedom House a [...] "Russophobic" [...] organization: [...] "You can listen to everything they say, except {{when it comes to}} Russia... There are many Russophobes there". In response, Christopher Walker, director of studies at Freedom House, argued that Freedom House made its evaluations based on objective criteria explained on the organization's web site, and he denied that it had a pro-U.S. agenda. [...] "If you <b>look</b> <b>closely</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 193 countries that we evaluate, you'll find that we criticize what are often considered strategic allies of the United States," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1930s Kornél Tolnai {{sometimes}} had his {{meetings with the}} L. M. Ericsson board of directors in the South Kings' Tower in Kungsgatan 33, as the company had until 1940 its representative office here. The South Kings' Tower is {{the one of the}} two towers, it is a 17-storey and 61m (200ft) and was built between 1924 and 1925. Together, they are considered the first modern skyscrapers in Europe. The South Kings' Tower was adorned with four towers figures from Roman mythology (Fortuna, Mercury, Neptune and Victoria) created by sculptor [...] Constructor was L. M. Ericsson's real estate company, and the company had until 1940 its representative office here. If you <b>look</b> <b>closely</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tower figures you will see that one of them (Victoria) carries a gilded Ericsson phone with the letters [...] "LME". In the top of the tower was until 1963 the restaurant Pagod which was a temperance restaurant, decorated by Aaron Sandberg in Chinese theme, which was run by the Salvation Army.|$|E
2500|$|A compass {{should be}} laid {{down on a}} level surface so that the needle only rests or hangs on the bearing fused to the compass casing – if used at a tilt, the needle might touch the casing on the compass and not move freely, hence not {{pointing}} to the magnetic north accurately, giving a faulty reading. To see if the needle is well leveled, <b>look</b> <b>closely</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> needle, and tilt it slightly {{to see if the}} needle is swaying side to side freely and the needle is not contacting the casing of the compass. If the needle tilts to one direction, tilt the compass slightly and gently to the opposing direction until the compass needle is horizontal, lengthwise. Items to avoid around compasses are magnets of any kind and any electronics. Magnetic fields from electronics can easily disrupt the needle, preventing it from aligning with the Earth's magnetic fields, causing inaccurate readings. The Earth's natural magnetic forces are considerably weak, measuring at 0.5 Gauss and magnetic fields from household electronics can easily exceed it, overpowering the compass needle. Exposure to strong magnets, or magnetic interference can sometimes cause the magnetic poles of the compass needle to differ or even reverse. Avoid iron rich deposits when using a compass, for example, certain rocks which contain magnetic minerals, like Magnetite. This is often indicated by a rock with a surface which is dark and has a metallic luster, not all magnetic mineral bearing rocks have this indication. [...] To see if a rock or an area is causing interference on a compass, get out of the area, and see if the needle on the compass moves. If it does, it means that the area or rock the compass was previously at is causing interference and should be avoided.|$|E

60|$|Not {{until he}} had eaten his fill did Martin begin to <b>look</b> <b>closely</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> flowers on the plant. It was the passion-flower, {{and he had never}} seen it before, and now that he looked well at it he thought it the loveliest and strangest flower he had ever beheld; not {{brilliant}} and shining, jewel-like, in the sun, like the scarlet verbena of the plains, or some yellow flower, but pale and misty, the petals being of a dim greenish cream-colour, with a large blue circle in the centre; and the blue, too, was misty like the blue haze in the distance on a summer day. To see and admire it better he reached out his hand and tried to pluck one of the flowers; then in an instant he dropped his hand, {{as if he had been}} pricked by a thorn. But there was no thorn and nothing to hurt him; he dropped his hand only because he felt that he had hurt the flower. Moving a step back he stared at it, and the flower seemed like a thing alive that looked back at him, and asked him why he had hurt it.|$|E
60|$|Why do I {{introduce}} these familiar truths so entirely {{irrelevant to}} my subject? I {{do it to}} show, in the first place, the contrast between a vague conception of a cause and a distinct conception of it; or rather, the contrast between that conception of a cause which results when it is simply classed with some other or others which familiarity makes us think we understand, and that conception of a cause which results when it is represented in terms of definite physical forces admitting of measurement. And I do it to show, in the second place, that when we insist on resolving a verbally-intelligible cause into its actual factors, we get not only a clear solution of the problem before us, but {{we find that the}} way is opened to solutions of sundry other problems. While we rest satisfied with unanalyzed causes, we may be sure both that we do not rightly comprehend the production of the particular effects ascribed to them, and that we overlook other effects which would be revealed to us by contemplation of the causes as analyzed. Especially must this be so where the causation is complex. Hence we may infer that the phenomena presented by the development of species, {{are not likely to be}} truly conceived unless we keep in view the concrete agencies at work. Let us <b>look</b> <b>closely</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> facts to be dealt with.|$|E
