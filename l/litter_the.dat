The group take shelter under cars to avoid conflict, though in his haste, T-Dog (IronE Singleton) severely cuts his arm. Some walkers spot Sophia (Madison Lintz), daughter of Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride), hiding under a car, and she flees into the nearby forest. Rick follows her and tells her to find someplace safe to hide while he dispatches the walkers.|$|E

5|$|Ants first arose {{during the}} mid-Cretaceous, more than 100 million years ago, {{associated}} {{with the rise of}} flowering plants and an increase in forest ground <b>litter.</b> <b>The</b> earliest known ants evolved from a lineage within the aculeate wasps, and a recent study suggests that they are a sister group of Apoidea. During the Cretaceous ants were confined to the northern Laurasian supercontinent, with only a few widespread primitive species. By the middle Eocene, around 50 million years ago, ants had diversified and become ecologically dominant as predators and scavengers. Ant species are less than 2% {{of the total number of}} insect species but make up one third of the insect biomass.|$|E
5|$|In 963, {{following}} the death of Emperor Romanos II, Nikephoros {{turned his attention to the}} power struggle that saw him ascend the imperial throne. The defeats of the previous years, and particularly the occupation of Aleppo, had dealt a heavy blow on Sayf al-Dawla's power and authority. At the same time, the Hamdanid prince also suffered from physical decline, with the onset of hemiplegia as well as worsening intestinal and urinary disorders, that henceforth confined him to a <b>litter.</b> <b>The</b> disease limited Sayf al-Dawla's ability to intervene personally in the affairs of his state; he soon abandoned Aleppo to the charge of his chamberlain, Qarquya, and spent most of his final years in Mayyafariqin, leaving his senior lieutenants to carry the burden of warfare against the Byzantines and the various rebellions that increasingly occurred in his domains.|$|E
5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle usually chooses {{tall trees}} or {{man-made}} pylons to nest in. Often, locations are sought {{where there is}} a tall dead tree or high branch with good visibility which {{can be used as a}} perch to survey the surrounding area, which is generally a low-lying locale near water with some forest cover. The perch becomes covered in faeces and pellets and animal remains <b>litter</b> <b>the</b> immediate surrounding area. The nest is a large deep bowl constructed of sticks and branches, and lined with such materials as grass or seaweed. Yearly renovations result in nests getting gradually bigger. Nests are generally sited in the forks of large trees overlooking bodies of water. Old nests of wedge-tailed eagles or whistling kites have been renovated and used. Cliffs are also suitable nesting sites, and on islands nests are sometimes built directly on the ground. A breeding pair, with the male being more active, spends three to six weeks building or renovating the nest before laying eggs. Normally a clutch of two dull, white, oval eggs are laid. Measuring 73×55mm, they are incubated over six weeks before hatching. The young are semi-altricial, and covered in white down when they emerge from the egg. Initially, the male brings food and the female feeds the chicks, but both parents feed the chicks as they grow larger. Although two eggs are laid, it is unusual for two young to be reared successfully to fledging (leaving the nest). One egg may be infertile, or the second chick may die in the nest. If the first clutch is lost, the parents may attempt a second brood. Nestlings have been recorded fledging when 70 to 80 days old, and remaining around the parents' territory for up to six months or until the following breeding season.|$|E

25|$|Oocysts in cat feces take {{at least}} a day to sporulate and become {{infectious}} after they are shed, so disposing of cat litter daily greatly reduces the chances of infectious oocysts being present in litter. As infectious oocysts from cat feces can spread and survive in the environment for months, humans should wear gloves when gardening or working with soil, and should wash their hands promptly after disposing of cat <b>litter.</b> <b>The</b> same precautions apply to outdoor sandboxes, which should be covered when not in use.|$|E
25|$|The {{spread of}} {{infection}} to pods above bare soil {{was shown to}} be greater relative to pods above <b>litter.</b> <b>The</b> {{reason for this is}} due to the splash of rain from bare soil spreads the inoculum to pods. However, litter under the tree prevented water droplets from splashing the soil particles as well as the inoculum beneath the litter to the above pods. Further, it was also reported that pods near the ground showed greater infections compared to higher pods due to greater soil was splashed and stick on the lower pods, therefore causes more infections.|$|E

25|$|Yosef Ben-Matityahu {{had hidden}} {{in one of}} the caves that <b>litter</b> <b>the</b> site, along with 40 other {{prominent}} citizens of Yodfat. Although Ben-Matityahu was in favour of surrendering to the Romans, the majority of his comrades opted to kill themselves rather than fall into Roman hands. As suicide is considered sinful, they decided to draw lots to kill each other. Ben-Matityahu and another man, however, were the last to survive, and both resolved to give themselves up. Taken to see the Roman general, Ben-Matityahu prophesied that Vespasian would one day become emperor. Vespasian subsequently spared the rebel leader, who began collaborating with the Romans. At first a slave, he would later be freed and be granted Roman citizenship as Flavius Josephus.|$|E
25|$|Their diet {{can include}} insects, earthworms, millipedes, lizards and amphibians. The blue vanga and chabert vanga {{occasionally}} eat fruit. Many species feed in small groups, often in mixed-species foraging flocks. The hook-billed vanga and Lafresnaye's vanga tend to forage alone. Vangas {{have a variety}} of different foraging strategies. Many species glean food as they move through the branches. The nuthatch vanga climbs up trunks and branches like a nuthatch but does not climb downwards as nuthatches do. Crossley's babbler forages by walking along the forest floor amongst the leaf <b>litter.</b> <b>The</b> chabert vanga and the tylas vanga often fly into the air to catch prey.

25|$|The Pompeians then {{attempted}} to flee over land, constantly pursued and harassed by Caesarian forces. In {{course of the}} flight, Pompeius the Younger was once more wounded, {{this time in the}} shoulder and left leg, so that his men had to carry him on a <b>litter.</b> <b>The</b> Pompeians eventually took refuge at a well defendable wooded hill near the town of Lauro, but they were discovered by a local, who reported them to the Caesarians. As result, Pompeius and his men were surrounded. The Caesarians, under command of Lucius Caesennius Lento, began to attack the Pompeian positions, but thanks to the natural conditions, the defenders were able to repulse multiple assaults. Thus thwarted, Lento's forces settled down to besiege and starve out the Pompeians. Recognizing this, the defenders resolved to try to break through the siege.|$|E
25|$|Dhar Tichitt and Oualata {{in present-day}} Mauritania figure {{prominently}} among the early urban centers, dated to 2,000 BC. About 500 stone settlements <b>litter</b> <b>the</b> {{region in the}} former savannah of the Sahara. Its inhabitants fished and grew millet. It {{has been found that}} the Soninke of the Mandé peoples were responsible for constructing such settlements. Around 300 BC the region became more desiccated and the settlements began to decline, most likely relocating to Koumbi Saleh. Architectural evidence and the comparison of pottery styles suggest that Dhar Tichitt was related to the subsequent Ghana Empire. Djenné-Djenno (in present-day Mali) was settled around 300 BC, and the town grew to house a sizable Iron Age population, as evidenced by crowded cemeteries. Living structures were made of sun-dried mud. By 250 BC Djenné-Djenno had become a large, thriving market town.|$|E
25|$|Hamsters are {{seasonal}} breeders {{and will}} produce several litters {{a year with}} several pups in each <b>litter.</b> <b>The</b> breeding season is from April to October in the Northern Hemisphere, with two to five litters of one to 13 young being born after a gestation period of 16 to 23 days. Gestation lasts 16 to 18 days for Syrian hamsters, 18 to 21 days for Russian hamsters, 21 to 23 days for Chinese hamsters and 23 to 30 for Roborovski hamsters. The average litter size for Syrian hamsters is about seven pups, but can be as great as 24, which is {{the maximum number of}} pups that can be contained in the uterus. Campbell's dwarf hamsters tend to have four to eight pups in a litter, but can have up to 13. Djungarian hamsters tend to have slightly smaller litters, as do Chinese and Roborovski hamsters.|$|E
