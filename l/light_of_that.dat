5|$|Routine {{observations}} {{were taken by}} the team on October 21, 2003, using the 1.2m Samuel Oschin Schmidt telescope at Palomar Observatory, California, but the image of Eris was not discovered at that point due to its very slow motion across the sky: The team's automatic image-searching software excluded all objects moving at less than 1.5arcseconds per hour {{to reduce the number}} of false positives returned. When Sedna was discovered, it was moving at 1.75arcsec/h, and in <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> the team reanalyzed their old data with a lower limit on the angular motion, sorting through the previously excluded images by eye. In January 2005, the re-analysis revealed Eris's slow motion against the background stars.|$|E
5|$|When making observations, {{scientists}} {{look through}} telescopes, study images on electronic screens, record meter readings, and so on. Generally, on a basic level, they {{can agree on}} what they see, e.g., the thermometer shows 37.9 degrees C. But, if these scientists have different ideas about the theories {{that have been developed}} to explain these basic observations, they may disagree about what they are observing. For example, before Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, observers would have likely interpreted the image at left as five different objects in space. In <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> theory, however, astronomers will tell you that there are actually only two objects, one in the center and four different images of a second object around the sides. Alternatively, if other scientists suspect that something is wrong with the telescope and only one object is actually being observed, they are operating under yet another theory. Observations that cannot be separated from theoretical interpretation are said to be theory-laden.|$|E

25|$|Justice Douglas {{asserted}} {{that there should}} be no distinction made between prospective relief and retrospective relief, as the drain on the state's treasury is the same in either case. He also strongly contended that Illinois had waived its immunity by entering the federal program, because the Court had recently found other states to have waived immunity by joining similar programs. Therefore, Douglas reasoned that Illinois had to have been aware of the possibility that entering the program would waive its own immunity, and its decision to participate in <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> danger showed a willingness to be held liable.|$|E
25|$|Socrates {{also says}} that the accusations {{for which he is}} {{answering}} in court already had been spoken and published by the comic poet Aristophanes, and are therefore beyond the legal scope of a trial for corruption and impiety. Years earlier, in the play The Clouds (423 BC), Aristophanes lampooned Socrates as a charlatan, the paradigm philosopher of atheist and scientific sophistry — carefully arranged arguments constructed of ornate words and phrases — misrepresented as wisdom. In <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> definition, Socrates defensively argues that he cannot be mistaken for a Sophist philosopher because Sophists are wise men, are thought to be wise by the people of Athens, and, thus, are highly paid for their teaching; whereas he (Socrates) lives in ten-thousand-fold poverty, and knows nothing noble and good (23c).|$|E

25|$|Issues {{surrounding}} {{the use of}} reason ('Aql) and rational came about {{in relation to the}} attributes of God for which he faced much resistance. At the time the Islamic scholars thought the attributes of God as stated in the Qur'an were contradictory to reason so sought other explanations instead. Ibn Taymiyyah believed that reason itself validated the entire Qur'an as being reliable and in <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> he argued, if some part of the scripture was to be rejected then this would render the use of reason as an unacceptable avenue through which to seek knowledge. He thought that the most perfect rational method and use of reason was contained within the Qur'an and sunnah and that the theologians of his time had used rational and reason in a flawed manner.|$|E
500|$|The Federalist Papers {{were written}} {{to support the}} {{ratification}} of the Constitution, specifically in New York. Whether they succeeded in this mission is questionable. Separate ratification proceedings took place in each state, and the essays were not reliably reprinted outside of New York; furthermore, {{by the time the}} series was well underway, a number of important states had already ratified it, for instance Pennsylvania on December 12. New York held out until July 26; certainly The Federalist was more important there than anywhere else, but Furtwangler argues that it [...] "could hardly rival other major forces in the ratification contests"—specifically, these forces included the personal influence of well-known Federalists, for instance Hamilton and Jay, and Anti-Federalists, including Governor George Clinton. Further, by the time New York came to a vote, ten states had already ratified the Constitution and it had thus already passed—only nine states had to ratify it for the new government to be established among them; the ratification by Virginia, the tenth state, placed pressure on New York to ratify. In <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> Furtwangler observes, [...] "New York's refusal would make that state an odd outsider." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Waters, the {{university}} petitioned the Supreme Court for certiorari. The Supreme Court told the Second Circuit {{to reconsider the}} case in <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> holding. In 1995, the Second Circuit reversed its original ruling, finding that under Waters the College could have reasonably considered Jeffries' speech disruptive enough to justify adverse action. Judge Joseph M. McLaughlin interpreted Waters to hold, relevant to the Jeffries case, [...] "that the closer the employee's speech reflects on matters of public concern, the greater must be the employer's showing that the speech {{is likely to be}} disruptive before it may be punished".|$|E

2500|$|Furthermore, the {{proposed}} design needed new testing. A purely mathematical solution to designing suspension spans {{was not possible}} because little was known about the forces that brought down Gertie. In <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> fact, engineers chose to design the replacement, then subject scale mockups of the design in a specially-built wind tunnel constructed at the University of Washington. According to Charles Andrew, [...] "The only way to attack the problem, was to design a bridge, then build a model of that design and subject it to wind action." [...] The testing was performed by Professor F. B. Farquharson, who had researched Gertie's motions prior to its collapse on November 7, 1940.|$|E

2500|$|However, as a result, {{the first}} Foundation has learned {{something}} of the Second Foundation beyond {{the simple fact that}} it exists, and has some understanding of its role. This means their behavior will now be chosen in <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> knowledge, and not based on uninformed natural human behavior, which means their behavior will no longer be the natural responses required by the mathematics of the Seldon Plan. This places the Plan itself at great risk. Additionally, the first Foundation instead starts to resentfully consider the other as a rival, and begins to develop equipment related to detecting and blocking mental influence, in order to detect members of the Second Foundation. After many attempts to unravel the Second Foundation's whereabouts from the minimal clues available, the Foundation is led to believe the Second Foundation is located on Terminus (being the [...] "opposite end" [...] of a galaxy, for a galaxy with a circular shape). The Foundation uncovers and destroys a group of 50 members of the Second Foundation and is left believing they have destroyed the Second Foundation.

2500|$|During his 23 {{years at}} Harvard, Lake {{continuously}} taught one very popular course, the English Bible, familiarly known as [...] "English 35". [...] When he taught {{the course for}} the first time in 1914, the course had less than 40 students, whereas his final year there were over 250—a [...] "625 per cent increase," [...] as the Harvard Crimson touted when announcing his final lecture would be 16 December 1937. [...] His book An Introduction to the New Testament (1937) is a [...] "skeleton of the course." [...] However, [...] "it does not give the flesh put on that skeleton by the lecturer" [...] (p. ix). [...] It was of course that [...] "flesh" [...] which made the course so interesting, due to Lake's lively imagination and engaging wit. [...] As he himself explains: [...] "The most important thing in a teacher's life is not to impart the knowledge of facts—which can be found much better in books—but to encourage another generation to look steadfastly at the vision which it sees, and to face its own problems in the <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> vision, controlled and guided by an understanding of what the past has done or not done" [...] (Paul, His Heritage and Legacy, 1934, p. xii). [...] He seems to have been effective, for James Luther Adams, one of his students during 1924–27, recalls: [...] "It was his characteristic interest to make historical figures come alive, so that we might see their significance today and not merely study them as so many items from a dead past." [...] "Something we all recognized in Kirsopp Lake," [...] writes Adams, [...] "was that he had the imagination of a Sherlock Holmes. [...] He took an almost childlike interest in digging out alternative answers to historical questions ... Students who thought themselves completely secularized and immune to any 'religious nonsense' attended his lectures and heard him publicly burrow down into the biblical concepts, taking as his point of departure something highly imaginative in one of the parables, and then rise up to fly with it. [...] The students used to call his courses 'Kirsopp's Fables.'" ...|$|E
