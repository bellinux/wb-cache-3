But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

They must then leave the first group and do a second outrun to fetch the others and bring them to join the first group.|$|E

We had sent Ken Joy, the former BBAR, to {{challenge}} for the Grand Prix des Nations, then 140 kilometres long, and dragging through the hills of the Chevreuse valley. All over Paris they talked about this burly Englishman who had ridden 160km in 4 hours and 6 minutes: and when it came to it, he was hammered by a 19-year-old, but a teenager with a will of iron that was to prove inflexible for the next 19 years.|$|E

The story focuses on individuals such as Tsutomu Yamaguchi, a hibakusha (explosion-affected person) who was the only person confirmed by the government of Japan to have survived the pika-don (flash-bang) of both attacks. The story of the impacts in Japan on the residents of the two targeted cities and of the response of the Japanese government to the attack is interwoven with details of the Americans who carried out the missions and their reactions to the damage they had wrought.|$|E

Out of the 300 Southern Rhodesians who had joined the KRRC in Egypt, only three officers and 109 other ranks remained {{at the end of}} the Tunisian Campaign. The Rhodesian Anti-Tank Battery retraced many of the movements it had taken during the campaign as it returned to Egypt. [...] "Left for Matruh at 0830 hours today," [...] one Rhodesian gunner wrote.

500|$|The {{novel is}} narrated {{in the first}} person through a series of [...] nine journaux intimes, kept by Mountstuart from age 17 until shortly before his death at 85. French {{literary}} journals, always published posthumously, are often extremely candid accounts, particularly of the author's sexual life. Boyd, himself a francophile, includes masturbation, prostitution and Mountstuart's three marriages. While Boyd had earlier written work in the form of memoir or biography, a journal is different: [...] "For a start, it's written without the benefit of hindsight, so there isn't the same feeling you get when you <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> add shape to a life. There are huge chunks missing." [...] The novel's grounding in everyday life and focus on characterisation place it firmly within realism.|$|E

[...] He later added during the Making of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom documentary, [...] "Temple of Doom is my least favorite of the trilogy. I <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> I say, 'Well the greatest thing that I got out of that was I met Kate Capshaw.' We married years later and that to me was the reason I was fated to make Temple of Doom." ...|$|E

[...] And you realize that the answer lies somewhere in a complex web of all kinds of stuff, like genetic make-up, upbringing, coincidences, choices you made along the way, missed opportunities, [...] lucky breaks." [...] She felt that it was a natural choice to centre on a relationship between two people, [...] "because relationships, and especially the romantic ones, play a huge role in shaping our lives, and also, obviously, in creating new ones." ...|$|E

He also presented two logos with the pink equal sign, symbol of the LBGT movement. The first one, featured the sign represented with two long braids; while the second one, featured the sign represented with two marijuana cigarettes. The use of the logos became viral instantly in social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook.|$|E
500|$|At {{approximately}} 7:20 pm on Friday, September 19, 2014, Gonzalez scaled {{the iron}} perimeter fence of the White House. Several agents pursued him, {{as he ran}} directly towards the North Portico doors, which were unlocked. President Barack Obama and his daughters had just left the White House and were heading to Camp David {{at the time of}} the incident. Michelle Obama was also not home, having travelled to the retreat earlier. Agents stated they chose not to shoot at Gonzalez as he did not have a weapon in his hands, and was not wearing clothing that could conceal a significant amount of explosives; the possibility of accidentally hitting civilians beyond the fence was also cited. A senior official stated: [...] "A lot of people want to judge the Secret Service for not shooting, but [...] number of things have to be considered in this situation, including whether or not the principal is in the residence" [...] adding, [...] "given what's emerged about [...] since the arrest, maybe we'll <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> say the Secret Service played a role in saving his life." ...|$|E

500|$|On its release, Rebel Heart {{received}} positive critical reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns {{a weighted}} mean rating out of 100 to reviews by music critics, the album received an average score of 68, based on 29 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". The Daily Telegraph writer Neil McCormick, Andy Gill of The Independent, AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine, and Lauren Murphy of The Irish Times each gave the album 4 out of 5 stars. McCormick felt that [...] "(f)or {{the first time}} in years, [...] doesn't sound desperate", praising it in comparison to Hard Candy and MDNA. Saeed called it: [...] "a fine collection of sturdy pop tunes in which Madonna finally allows herself to <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> sometimes pilfer from her peak periods of the late 80s and early 2000s". Murphy wrote [...] "the indisputable pop icon is back with a tentative bang" [...] after MDNA had [...] "few memorable pop hits". For Gill, the most impressive aspect of Rebel Heart was Madonna's vocals, while Erlewine found the album to be a revival of Madonna's defiant side and her confessional mood.|$|E
500|$|Code: Veronica {{producer}} Shinji Mikami said [...] "Claire {{became a}} lot tougher than I Imagined. I thought she should look the same, but the game director made her that way because she had such an experience in Resident Evil 2, she could handle any situation now!" [...] For Revelations 2, the now hardened and aggressive Claire was redesigned to be a contrasting character to the young, immature and easily scared Moira Burton, who {{was defined as a}} purely supporting character, and they both serve different roles in the story and have different functions. Producer Michiteru Okabe said: [...] "Really, only after did we <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> say, 'Oh, I guess they are both girls.' Which is good, because it means we’re treating them as whole characters and not just as their gender. What we settled on is the idea that you have different roles -- it isn’t two against the world, it’s one against the world with a helper." [...] Okabe also said the game's writer Dai Satō [...] "is a big fan of her personally" [...] {{which was one of the}} factors that led to Claire's return.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Clarence Waldron from Jet, Cole said the idea of recording a Christmas album started after {{a telephone call from}} producer and longtime friend Michael Masser, with whom Cole had worked on the song [...] "Someone That I Used to Love" [...] from her 1980 album Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Back</b> <b>and</b> her 1989 single [...] "Miss You Like Crazy". Cole described the telephone call from Masser as unexpected; Masser told her, [...] "I've got this beautiful Christmas song I wrote just for you". When they met, Messer played [...] "No More Blue Christmas"; after the session they both agreed to record a Christmas album. Cole described the decision to form a Christmas album as leaving her [...] "running around in April, looking for Christmas songs". Cole expressed hope that the album would remind her fans about [...] "the true spirit of the holiday season". She wanted it to communicate that Christmas is [...] "a time for families to reflect and not just wait until the holidays to be a family". Cole's twin sister Timolin Cole said, [...] "Christmas Eve has always been a magical time with Natalie" [...] when she could connect with family over holiday traditions.|$|E

500|$|California has {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 63 out of 100, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews" [...] based on seventeen reviews. AllMusic's Neil Z. Yeung dubbed the record [...] "their best in 15 years," [...] considering it [...] "a return {{to form and}} an admirable maturation of the band's classic pop-punk sound... It's not a desperate grasp at youth and faded glory, but rather a reflective <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> an expert execution {{of what they do}} best." [...] Gav Lloyd from Rock Sound wrote that [...] "Blink-182 have delivered an album that recalls everything that makes this band great and gives it all a fresh twist, the end result is California being amongst the best albums they've ever produced." [...] NME Charlotte Gunn felt California [...] "has the humour, pace, emotion and huge choruses of a classic Blink record." [...] Evan Lucy at Alternative Press felt it [...] "upbeat, hooky and, above anything else, a total blast." [...] Exclaim!s Josiah Hughes was more critical, calling it [...] "uneven and disjointed" [...] and [...] "hard to take in as one larger whole".|$|E
500|$|Even {{though the}} show was set in Miami, filming took place at Sunset Gower Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles. Stock {{exterior}} shots of Miami {{were used for the}} opening credits and transitions between scenes. The series was filmed with a multiple-camera setup, with each episode last roughly 20 to 22 minutes excluding commercials. Eve said she was initially intimidated by the amount of work required to prepare for and film a television series. During an interview with Billboard, she explained that while filming the first season she felt like she [...] "just wanted to leave because there was so much to learn, it's just a different world". Since she found comedy to be challenging due to the [...] "certain beats you have to learn", Eve hired two acting coaches to help improve her timing. One of her coaches was Chip Fields, who visited the show's set to offer Eve acting advice. During the development of the second season, Eve viewed the set as her home, and felt the process was easier, having grown closer to the cast and crew. In a 2016 interview with Grazia, she revealed her regret at not fully committing herself to her character and the series. She explained: [...] "I was the youngest person on set and was clubbing in between being on set and learning my lines. I <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> wish I was more dedicated.
