40|$|As Hong Kong's {{property}} {{prices have been}} skyrocketing particularly {{in the last several}} years, housing has become even less affordable than it was prior to the Asian Financial Crisis, compromising Hong Kong residents' living standards. The general public mostly blames the supply-side actors (i. e. property developers and/or the government) for such a predicament, and vociferously demands for higher supply of residential flats both in the private and public sectors. The government, in response, proposes the supply of more residential land, among other measures, in addressing the public's demands, with the notion of "higher land supply results in higher housing supply". Nonetheless, there are other channels, other than land sale, which provide land for housing construction, such as land exchange, which are usually overlooked in public debates. In the light of this, this paper aims to investigate the respective impact of land sale and land exchange on Hong Kong's housing supply. The findings, interestingly, show that land exchange has a much larger long-run impact on housing supply than land sale does; that housing supply responds to short-run fluctuations in property price; and that best lending rate has neither a short- nor long-run relationship with the supply of housing. The reason behind the finding regarding land sale and land exchange is that, the former is initiated by the government which overlooks property developers' profit incentives and development strategies, while the latter essentially reflects that a particular <b>land</b> site is <b>ripe</b> <b>for</b> <b>development</b> (i. e. profitable) from the developers' standpoint. Some implications relating to the recently announced government land policy measures are also discussed. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|R

50|$|Zwanenburg {{takes its}} name from Gemeenlandshuis Zwanenburg, the former {{headquarters}} of the Hoogheemraadschap Rijnland, a water board that used to have its headquarters in Halfweg, {{on the other side of}} the canal known today as the Ringvaart. Up until the 19th century, Zwanenburg was under water. When the pumping station at Halfweg had succeeded in making the <b>land</b> <b>ripe</b> <b>for</b> building, the workers who had settled at Halfweg purchased this cheap land below the dike for their homes. The infrastructure linking Halfweg to Haarlem and Amsterdam was already quite good, so Zwanenburg became a true commuter town. Halfweg was also the site of a large sugar factory, first opened in 1863, that served as an employer for Zwanenburg residents for more than a century. For this reason, the history of Zwanenburg cannot be seen separately from the history of Halfweg.|$|R

50|$|As the Bronze Age {{began in}} the early 1970s, {{popularity}} shifted away from the established superhero genre towards comic book titles from which superheroes were absent altogether. These non-superhero comics were typically inspired by genres like Westerns or fantasy & pulp fiction. As previously noted, 1971's revised Comics Code left the horror genre <b>ripe</b> <b>for</b> <b>development</b> and several supernaturally-themed series resulted, such as the popular The Tomb of Dracula, Ghost Rider, and Swamp Thing. In the science fiction genre, post-apocalyptic survival stories were an early trend, as evidenced by characters like Deathlok, Killraven, and Kamandi. The long-running sci-fi/fantasy anthology comic magazine Metal Hurlant and its American counterpart Heavy Metal began publishing in the late '70s. Marvel's Star Wars series was very popular with a nine-year run.|$|R

50|$|With {{the arrival}} of the Normans, the Manor of Beckenham took on added importance, and {{controlled}} much of what is modern Beckenham. St George's Church was built in the 12th century. In the Middle Ages, the manor lands were divided: at this time the estates of Kelsey and Langley came into being. Beckenham still remained a small village until well into the 19th century. The beginning of its growth began when, in 1773, John Cator built Beckenham Place and became Lord of the Manor. After he died in 1807, his sons soon became aware that the area in such close proximity to London was <b>ripe</b> <b>for</b> <b>development,</b> especially once the railway had arrived in 1857; and large villas began to be built around the new station. Wide roads and large gardens epitomised these properties.|$|R

Manchester {{was late in}} commissioning a war memorial compared to most British towns and cities—the city council did not convene a war memorial committee until 1922. The committee quickly raised £10,000 but finding a suitable location for the monument proved controversial. The preferred site in Albert Square required the removal and relocation of several statues, and was opposed by the city's artistic community. The next choice was Piccadilly Gardens, an area <b>ripe</b> <b>for</b> <b>development,</b> but {{in the interests of}} expediency, the council chose St Peter's Square, although it already contained a cross commemorating the former St Peter's Church. Negotiations to move the cross were unsuccessful and the cenotaph was built with the cross in situ.|$|R

Future everyday life is certain to be different from today, but how is it shaped in the present, how might such futures be made differently, and what theories and methods would be required to do this? This Everyday Futures essay collection brings a range of concepts and methods to bear on these questions, exploring what everyday futures are, and how and why they might form the starting point for a new research agenda. The essays develop discussions initiated at the Everyday Futures Workshop held at the Institute for Social Futures, Lancaster University in July 2016...|$|R

A power plant that served parts of Safety Harbor, Dunedin, and Clearwater was constructed. The streets were paved with oyster shells obtained nearby. Olds named many of the streets himself. Woodward, Jefferson, and Congress reminded him of Detroit. Olds named Gim Gong Road after a Chinese American horticulturist from DeLand, Florida. Gim Gong was working on developing frost-resistant citrus. The streets of Oldsmar were unusually wide and more than 20 mi of sidewalk were installed.
