5|$|The first {{crude oil}} arrived at Phoenixville via the Big Inch on August 14, 1943, {{and the first}} refined product in the <b>Little</b> <b>Big</b> Inch arrived on March 2, 1944. The Big Inch carried up to 334,456 barrels of crude oil a day, the <b>Little</b> <b>Big</b> Inch 239,844 barrels of gasoline; the lines were among the largest {{industrial}} consumers of electricity in the US, requiring 3.89 million kilowatt {{hours a day to}} pump the oil along the pipes.|$|E

5|$|The American {{historian}} Gary Clayton Anderson of the University of Oklahoma published Sitting Bull and the Paradox of Lakota Nationhood (2010), a revisionist {{examination of}} the Lakota medicine man. Anderson stresses the <b>Little</b> <b>Big</b> Horn in light of past successes of the Lakota Nation and the merits of Sitting Bull himself, rather than simply a mishap by Custer.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the {{war there}} were {{extended}} arguments over how the pipelines should be used. In 1947, the Texas East Transmission Corporation purchased the pipelines for $143,127,000, the largest post-war disposal of war-surplus property. The corporation converted them to transport natural gas, transforming the energy market in the north-east. The <b>Little</b> <b>Big</b> Inch was returned to carry oil in 1957. The pipelines are owned by Spectra Energy Partners and Enterprise Products and remain in use.|$|E
5|$|Congressional {{reaction}} to the losses suffered by Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer's unit at the Battle of the <b>Little</b> <b>Big</b> Horn in 1876 was shock and dismay at {{the failure of the}} Peace Policy. Grant blamed Custer wholly for the defeat stating that the sacrifice of troops was unnecessary. The Indian appropriations measure of August 1876 marked the end of Grant's Peace Policy. The Sioux were given the choice of either selling their lands in the Black Hills for cash or not receiving government gifts of food and other supplies.|$|E

5|$|Work on the Inch {{pipelines}} began {{immediately after}} {{the establishment of the}} WEP on June 26, 1942. They were built in three phases. The first part to be constructed was the Big Inch, its initial leg running to an interim terminal at Norris City, where oil was to be off-loaded to the railroad network. Once this leg was complete, it was extended to its terminus at Phoenixville. When the Big Inch was complete, work began on the third phase of the project, the <b>Little</b> <b>Big</b> Inch.|$|E

5|$|Custer’s 7th Cavalry {{advance party}} {{attacked}} Cheyenne and Lakota tribes at their {{camp on the}} <b>Little</b> <b>Big</b> Horn River (known as the Greasy Grass River to the Lakota) on June 25, 1876. The U.S. Army did not realize how large the camp was. More than 2,000 Native American warriors had left their reservations to follow Sitting Bull. Inspired by a vision of Sitting Bull’s, in which he saw U.S. soldiers being killed {{as they entered the}} tribe’s camp, the Cheyenne and Lakota fought back. Custer's badly outnumbered troops lost ground quickly and were forced to retreat. The tribes led a counter-attack against the soldiers on a nearby ridge, ultimately annihilating them.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, the {{operation}} of the <b>Little</b> <b>Big</b> Inch, and its ownership south of Ohio, was transferred from TETCO to the subsidiary Texas Eastern Petroleum Products Corporation (TEPPCO), and converted back to use for petroleum products. TEPPCO was purchased by Enterprise Products in 2010. Around 1961, there was discussion of converting the Big Inch pipeline back to petroleum use, but it continued in use as a gas pipeline. In 1989, TETCO was taken over by the Panhandle Eastern Corporation, and in 1997 this company was merged with Duke Power, to form the Duke Energy Corporation; in 2007, the oil pipelines were spun off from Duke Energy, to form part of Spectra Energy Partners.|$|E

5|$|The Big Inch and <b>Little</b> <b>Big</b> Inch, collectively {{known as}} the Inch pipelines, are {{petroleum}} pipelines extending from Texas to New Jersey, built between 1942 and 1944 as emergency war measures in the U.S. Before World War II, petroleum products were transported from the oil fields of Texas to the north-eastern states by sea by oil tankers. After the United States entered the war on 1 January 1942, this vital link was attacked by German submarines in the Operation Paukenschlag, threatening both the oil supplies to the north-east and its onward transshipment to Great Britain. The Secretary of the Interior, Harold Ickes, championed the pipeline project {{as a way of}} transporting petroleum by the more-secure, interior route.|$|E
5|$|Where it was {{necessary}} for the pipeline to curve to fit the route, the steel pipes were bent, using either a cold-bending approach, in which tractors would pull and push the pipelines into position, or a hot-bending method, with the pipe heated up by blow-torches and pulled into place using a jig. A new, specialized piece of equipment for bending pipes, the Cummings bending jig, was invented during the Big Inch build, and used on the construction of the <b>Little</b> <b>Big</b> Inch pipeline. To protect the pipeline from corrosion, its outside was then cleaned by machine, and painted in first a layer of coal tar enamel, and then hot coal tar coating, before being wrapped in asbestos felt. Finally the pipeline was lowered into position, taking care not to damage the ends of the pipes; the larger pipes were so heavy that they required a D-8 caterpillar tractor equipped with counter-weights to lift them. The trench was then back-filled, completing the process.|$|E
