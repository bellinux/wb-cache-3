40|$|Interferon was optimally {{produced}} in human peripheral leukocyte cultures incubated for approximately 19 hr {{in the presence}} of Sendai virus at a multiplicity of 10 to 50 EID 50 /cell. For determining whether deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis per se was essential for interferon production, 1 -β-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara-C), a potent DNA inhibitor was studied for its effect on interferon production in leukocytic and bone marrow cell cultures. These cells showed no impaired capacity to produce interferon when treated with 15 μg of Ara-C per ml. Interferon yields were also determined in leukocyte cultures treated with actinomycin D (0. 1 μg/ml) and puromycin (10 μg/ml) at various times before and after virus inoculation. The data suggested that sequential transcriptive and translational events were required for the de novo synthesis of interferon by the infected leukocytes, {{in a manner similar to}} other known virus-induced interferon-producing systems.

The molecular weights of the <b>leukocyte</b> <b>interferon</b> components, as determined on Sephadex G- 75, are quite similar or identical, approximately 26, 000.

IFN-alpha J appeared to interact with receptors for IFN on NK cells since it was found to interfere with the boosting of NK activity by other species of IFN-alpha. In contrast to its deficient ability to augment NK activity, IFN-alpha J has potent antiviral and antiproliferative activities. Such extensive dissociation of these biological activities has not been observed previously with any other natural or recombinant IFN species.

Spontaneously produced interferon was liberated by cells only during logarithmic growth phase, reaching levels ranging from about 10 reference units/ml of growth medium for some cell lines to 1000 reference units/ml for others. The interferons produced by induced lymphoblastoid cells and the spontaneously produced interferons were all characterized as type I human <b>leukocyte</b> <b>interferon</b> by high levels of cross-species antiviral activities on bovine cells and by neutralizations by antiserum to human <b>leukocyte</b> <b>interferon</b> but not by antiserum to human fibroblast interferon.

Eosinophils, common in allergic asthma, secrete cationic proteins, particularly major basic protein (MBP). The effect of poly-L-arginine, an analogue of MBP, on airway epithelial cells was investigated. Poly-L-arginine induced membrane damage, resulting in increased permeability, loss of cell-cell contracts (tight junctions and desmosomes) and generalized cell damage. Adhesion molecules on airway epithelial cells may be important in recruiting <b>leukocytes.</b> <b>Interferon</b> (IFN) -γ increased intracellular adhesion molecule- 1 expression in airway epithelial cell lines. A combination of interleukin- 4 and IFN-γ opened the tight junctions. Epithelial damage in asthma was studied at the ultrastructural level in bronchial biopsies from patients with atopic or non-atopic asthma, and healthy controls. Epithelial damage was extensive in both asthma groups. In basal and columnar cells, relative desmosome length was reduced by 30 - 40 %. In columnar cells, half-desmosomes were noticed. Changes {{tended to be more}} extensive in atopic asthma, but {{there was no significant difference}} between the two groups. Reduced desmosomal contact may be important in the epithelial shedding observed in asthma. The contact area between columnar cells and basal lamina is relatively small in the human airway. Attachment of columnar cells to the basal lamina occurs indirectly, via desmosomal attachment to basal cells. Direct attachment of columnar cells to the basal lamina is weakened in asthmatics. Nasal polyposis is a chronic inflammatory disease often associated with asthma. An ultrastructural study showed that epithelial damage of columnar cells is more pronounced in allergic patients. The length of columnar cell desmosomes was significantly reduced in asthmatics vs. non-asthmatics, and in allergics vs. non-allergics. Cell contacts in airway epithelium in asthmatics are weakened, which may be an intrinsic feature or due to the presence of eosinophils producing toxic proteins...|$|R
