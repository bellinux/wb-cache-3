The first study examines the nomological networks of two proprietary measures of learning agility in sample of 832 individuals. The <b>learning</b> agility <b>simulation</b> {{is designed to be}} an objective measure of learning agility ability. The learning agility indicator is a self-report measure designed to measure the preference towards learning agile behaviors. The results of study one indicate two different nomological networks for the <b>learning</b> agility <b>simulation</b> and the <b>learning</b> agility indicator. Specifically, the <b>learning</b> agility <b>simulation</b> was related to cognitive personality variables (i. e., tolerance for ambiguity and cognitive flexibility) and cognitive ability, and the learning agility indicator was more strongly related to personality variables. The second study explores the work-related outcomes associated with the <b>learning</b> agility <b>simulation,</b> and the incremental validity of the <b>learning</b> agility <b>simulation</b> over traditional predictors of performance (i. e., Big Five personality variables, cognitive ability). The second study was performed with a sample of early career employees with supervisor rated performance/potential measures in a sample of 89 paired responses. The results of study two indicated that the <b>learning</b> agility <b>simulation</b> was significantly related to two areas of employee potential (learning from experience and speed-to-competence) and provided incremental validity over traditional predictors of performance/potential for these areas of performance...|$|R

This paper presents a <b>learning</b> <b>simulation</b> game for EPCM (engineering, procurement, and construction management) project management training. The simulation model utilises system dynamics, {{which is a}} methodology for understanding the behaviour of dynamic complex systems of different domains using modelling and simulation. The system dynamics model in turn uses the equation-based Modelica modelling language: a system dynamics model created with the graphical user interface is converted to a pure Modelica model. Two Modelica environments, namely, OpenModelica and the custom Modelica solver, {{have been used to}} simulate the generated Modelica model. The focus of this article is on how generic systems modelling and simulation platforms such as Modelica based environments can be utilised in developing a <b>learning</b> <b>simulation</b> game: what benefits do they bring and what disadvantages do they have? On the one hand, it is evaluated how the Modelica language as such is suitable for being used in a learning game development.

The investigation was conducted using a crossover repeated measures design based on a sample of 128 high school biology/biotech students. The results showed that the virtual <b>learning</b> <b>simulation</b> increased knowledge of evolution significantly, compared to the traditional lesson. No significant differences between the simulation and lesson were found in their ability to increase the non-cognitive measures. Both interventions increased self-efficacy significantly, and none of them had a significant effect on motivation. In addition, the results showed that the simulation increased interest in biology related tasks, but not outcome expectations. The findings suggest that virtual learning simulations are at least as efficient in enhancing learning and self-efficacy as traditional lessons, and high schools can thus use them as supplementary educational methods. In addition, the findings indicate that virtual learning simulations may be a useful tool in enhancing student’s interest in and goals toward STEM related careers...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} steps in curriculum development is the introduction of simulation- based medical teaching and <b>learning.</b> <b>Simulation</b> is a generic term that refers to an artificial representation of a real world process to achieve educational goals through experiential <b>learning.</b> <b>Simulation</b> based medical education is defined as any educational activity that utilizes simulation aides to replicate clinical scenarios. Although medical simulation is relatively new, simulation has been used {{for a long time in}} other high risk professions such as aviation. Medical simulation allows the acquisition of clinical skills through deliberate practice rather than an apprentice style of <b>learning.</b> <b>Simulation</b> tools serve as an alternative to real patients. A trainee can make mistakes and learn from them without the fear of harming the patient. There are different types and classification of simulators and their cost vary according to the degree of their resemblance to the reality, or ‘fidelity’. Simulation- based learning is expensive. However, it is cost-effective if utilized properly. Medical simulation has been found to enhance clinical competence at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. It has also been found to have many advantages that can improve patient safety and reduce health care costs through the improvement of the medical provider's competencies. The objective of this narrative review article is to highlight the importance of simulation as a new teaching method in undergraduate and postgraduate education...|$|E
