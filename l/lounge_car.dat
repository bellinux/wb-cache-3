25|$|Since the 1980s dome {{cars have}} become rare since Amtrak {{introduced}} Superliner bi-level passenger {{cars that are}} 16 feet tall over {{the length of the}} car (but at a stretch the Superliner <b>lounge</b> <b>car</b> could be considered a dome car). Dome cars are very popular on tourist railways and private charter rail services. Some railroad museums have preserved several dome cars.

25|$|A {{dome car}} {{is a type of}} railway {{passenger}} car that has a glass dome {{on the top of the}} car where passengers can ride and see in all directions around the train. It also can include features of a coach, <b>lounge</b> <b>car,</b> dining car, sleeping car or observation. Beginning in 1945, dome cars were primarily used in the United States and Canada, though a small number were constructed in Europe for Trans Europ Express service, and similar panorama cars are in service on Alpine tourist railways like the Bernina Express.|$|E
500|$|Also {{introduced}} was a twin-unit {{dining car}} and a mid-train <b>lounge</b> <b>car,</b> such as Harbor Rest, [...] described by a PRR brochure as [...] "cheerful, spacious ... richly appointed for leisure with deep, soft carpets ... latest periodicals are in the libraries." [...] The February 1956 Official Guide listed the westbound Broadway Limited (train 29) consist as having fourteen cars normally assigned: nine sleeping cars between New York and Chicago, one additional sleeping car from New York continuing through to Los Angeles on the Santa Fe's Super Chief, the twin-unit dining car, <b>lounge</b> <b>car,</b> and observation car. The train departed New York at 6:00p.m. Eastern Standard Time and arrived at Chicago the following morning at 9:00a.m. Central Time.|$|E
500|$|Between 1937 and 1958, the Royal Blue was {{equipped}} with air-conditioned coaches, parlor cars with private drawing rooms, a <b>lounge</b> <b>car</b> for coach passengers, a full dining car serving complete meals, and a flat-end observation car with a [...] "cafe-lounge" [...] {{bringing up the rear}} of the train. Beginning in mid-August 1947, onboard telephone service was provided, making the B (along with the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central Railroad) one of the first three railroads in the U.S. to offer telephone service on its trains, using a forerunner of cell phone technology.|$|E

2500|$|In North America, dome {{cars were}} {{manufactured}} by the Budd Company, Pullman Standard and American Car & Foundry. Southern Pacific Railroad built its own dome cars in its Sacramento, California, shops. In the 1990s Colorado Railcar began producing dome cars. Generally, {{seats in the}} dome were considered [...] "non-revenue" [...] like <b>lounge</b> <b>car</b> seats. When dome cars operate today in excursion trains, the dome seats often command a premium fare.|$|E
2500|$|Amtrak {{operated}} the City of New Orleans reliably through the 1980s {{and into the}} 1990s; in 1992, the City of New Orleans had the highest on-time performance rate of all Amtrak services at 87%. Nevertheless, on-board service had declined; Trains magazine editor J. David Ingles called the train [...] "Amtrak's least-glamorous long-distance train." [...] On March 3, 1994, new Superliner cars replaced the single-level cars. Real dining service returned; by the early 1990s an Amfleet dinette had doubled with the <b>lounge</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Lounge</b> <b>cars</b> {{operated}} by Pullman were {{exclusively for the}} use of sleeping car passengers, while those {{operated by}} the railroad were available to coach as well as first-class travelers. Buffet <b>lounge</b> <b>cars</b> were often found in trains which did not offer full dining car service. On other trains they supplemented the diner and offered sandwiches, burgers and short orders at times when the diner was not serving; e.g. mid-afternoon and late night. To qualify as a buffet <b>lounge</b> the <b>car</b> had to offer both food and drink service. Buffet lounges {{should not be confused with}} snack or grill cars which did not offer a full range of libations.|$|R

2500|$|Siemens {{was founded}} in 1847 in Berlin, Germany {{building}} Conglomerates, Electric and Industry products, Healthcare Radioative systems, rolling stock, etc. The Siemens [...] "Viaggio" [...] passenger car models are to all purposes in the European railways: Viaggio Twin: double-deck coaches used on CityNightLine and ÖBB CityShuttle regional trains; Viaggio Classic: Original Siemens passenger cars, similar to Eurofima UIC cars, used in Germany, Greece, Czech Republic and Austria; Viaggio Light: new low-floor regional passenger coaches now used in Israel and Viaggio Comfort: New luxury articulated coaches used on ÖBB's railjet and Siemens Coach 2000 prototype <b>lounge</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Between the 1930s and its {{discontinuance}} in 1956, the Marylander {{was equipped}} with air-conditioned coaches, parlor cars with private drawing rooms, a <b>lounge</b> <b>car,</b> and a full dining car serving complete meals. [...] Beginning in mid-August 1947, onboard telephone service was provided, making the B (along with the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central Railroad) {{one of the first}} three railroads in the U.S. to offer telephone service on its trains, using a forerunner of cell phone technology. The train's accelerated four-hour schedule necessitated the use of track pans to replenish the Marylanders 4-6-2 President-class Pacific steam locomotives' water supply without stopping, to maintain as fast a schedule as possible. By September 1947, the Marylander and all other B New YorkWashington passenger trains were powered by diesel locomotives.|$|E
2500|$|With the two Hi-Level prototypes {{in service}} and proving {{to not only}} {{meet the needs of}} line but also being popular with {{passengers}} who were afforded a much better view of the scenery from the upper level, the Santa Fe again approached Budd with the idea of building additional two-level cars, this time in five different configurations: Step-down coaches like the two prototype cars, convertible coaches which could have one end of the car converted from the high level on both ends to a step-down car as needed, coaches with both ends of the car having the end door at the upper level's height to provide access to adjoining passenger cars, dining <b>cars</b> and <b>lounge</b> <b>cars</b> (with kitchens on the lower level) which featured a partial glassed-in roof similar to the Big Dome <b>lounge</b> <b>cars</b> that were also built by Budd and delivered around the time the prototype Hi-Level cars were built. (The Hi-Level <b>lounge</b> <b>cars</b> are the only Hi-Level cars that remain in use by Amtrak.) ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Lounge</b> <b>cars</b> are an {{important}} part of the appeal of passenger trains when compared to aircraft, buses and cars; there is more space to move around, socialize, eat and drink, and a good view.|$|R
50|$|In 1947 and 1948, {{after the}} demise of the Golden Rocket, {{streamlined}} sleeping, chair, meal and <b>lounge</b> <b>cars</b> were added. As five consists were necessary, RI and SP each supplied two or three different cars.|$|R
2500|$|M-10004 was {{matched with}} a {{trainset}} of tapered cross-section, low profile articulated cars {{of the type}} built for the earlier M-1000x trainsets. [...] The first cars had been built in anticipation of another tapered turret cab locomotive, but Union Pacific decided instead to cancel the proposed turret cab, expand the set to nine cars, and match it with a more powerful locomotive set of the newer design. [...] The <b>lounge</b> <b>car</b> of the M-10004 set was also built with a food preparation facility occupying its blind rear, which was revised with a new layout and porthole style rear windows between the train's City of San Francisco and City of Los Angeles service periods. [...] The M-10005 and M-10006 trainsets were built straight-sided to increase interior space, semi-articulated, and shorter by two sleeper cars than the M-10004 set. [...] All of the M-1000x trainsets were lower profile than standard passenger railcars.|$|E
2500|$|A {{dome car}} can include {{features}} of a <b>lounge</b> <b>car,</b> dining car, and an observation car. [...] Within the United States, the primary manufacturers were The Budd Co.(Stainless Steel construction), The Pullman Co (Steel construction), and ACF(American Car & Foundry. Aluminum construction). [...] A portion of the car, usually in the center, is split between two levels, with stairs leading both up and down from the train's regular passenger car floor level. [...] The lower level of the dome usually consisted of a small lounge area, while the upper portion was usually coach or lounge seating within a [...] "bubble" [...] of glass on the car's roof. [...] Budd Co. dome cars used curved class, whereas Pullman company cars used flat panels of glass that were positioned at different angles above the roofline. [...] Passengers in the upper portion of the dome {{were able to see}} in all directions from a vantage point above the train's roof line. [...] On some dome cars, the lower portion was built as a galley, where car attendants used dumbwaiters to transfer items between the galley and a dining area in the dome portion of the car(within the USA, the Union Pacific, prior to Amtrak, was the primary owner/user of 'dome dining cars.') [...]|$|E
2500|$|The Super Chief {{included}} dining cars, {{staffed by}} Fred Harvey Company personnel, {{as part of}} its standard consist from the outset. In general, the Super Chief operated 36-seat dining cars, although most of them were convertible to 48-seat dining cars with a flip-top (or change of) table and addition of chairs. Dining cars almost always operated with a <b>lounge</b> <b>car</b> coupled to them for bar-lounge service and a waiting area when the dining car was full. [...] Unlike the Union Pacific [...] "City" [...] trains, the Super Chief and other Santa Fe trains did not use the [...] "twin-unit" [...] dining cars. [...] Santa Fe, in general, ran somewhat shorter trains that could be serviced with a single dining car (although the heavyweight trains frequently operated in several sections, the streamlined trains generally did not). The height of Super Chief lounge and dining facilities came in 1951 with the new 600-series Dining Cars bracketed by the 500 series Pleasure Domes in front and a bar-lounge-dormitory unit in back (moved {{from the front of the}} trains). [...] The train still operated with the Vista-series 4 Drawing Room, 1 double bedroom observation cars on the rear, albeit without any bar or buffet service.|$|E
5|$|Car types include coaches, dining <b>cars,</b> <b>lounges,</b> and {{sleeping}} <b>cars.</b> Most passenger spaces {{are on the}} upper level, which features a row of windows on both sides. The Sightseer <b>Lounge</b> observation <b>cars</b> have distinctive floor-to-ceiling windows on the upper level. Boarding is on the lower level; passengers climb up a center stairwell to access the upper level.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Sightseer lounges, Amtrak converted five Superliner I dining <b>cars</b> to <b>lounge</b> <b>cars</b> in 1998 for use on the Auto Train, an automobile-carrying overnight train between Virginia and Florida. These cars may be distinguished from the Sightseer lounges by their conventional windows.|$|R
5000|$|The premier New York-Boston {{passenger}} train was the Merchants Limited, leaving Grand Central and South Station at 5 PM. Also prominent was the Yankee Clipper, with 1 PM departures. For many years these trains carried no coaches; only parlor cars and dining and <b>lounge</b> <b>cars.</b>|$|R
2500|$|While {{the partial}} dome cars {{were the most}} common, a number of {{variations}} on the dome car (typically called [...] "observation" [...] cars) were developed. [...] In particular the full length dome car, the dome <b>lounge</b> <b>car,</b> {{as well as the}} [...] "transition" [...] car stand out. [...] In the case of the former, the observation dome extended the full length of the car, with a lower level which contained a lounge or bar beneath it. [...] This type of car was used extensively by the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe and Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (Milwaukee Road) railroads. [...] Transition cars were similar to full length dome cars, save in one regard. These cars were intended to serve as a transition between regular rolling stock, and double deck stock. [...] To facilitate this, one vestibule of the car was lower, while the other was {{at the height of the}} upper vestibule of the double deck stock. [...] Amtrak utilized these transition cars for a time, primarily in situations where cars inherited from other railroads made up the bulk of Amtrak's rolling stock. [...] The transition cars were utilized primarily in the early days of Amtrak, and began to be phased out of service as Amtrak began to purchase, or produce, its own double deck cars. [...] The majority of transition cars were scrapped, though a few were kept in service and rebuilt into more [...] "traditional" [...] high vestibule double deck cars.|$|E
