5000|$|Crystal {{structure}} {{analysis showed}} that the first generation NNRTIs (for example TIBO, nevirapine and α-APA) bind HIV-1 RT in a “butterfly-like” conformation. These first generation NNRTIs were vulnerable against the common drug-resistance mutations like Tyr-181C and Tyr-188L/H. This triggered the need for finding new and more effective NNRTIs. ITU (imidoylthiourea), a promising series of NNRTIs emerged from α-APA analogs (figure 4). The ITU compounds were obtained by extending the linker that binds the aryl side groups of the α-APA. A potent ITU compound, R100943, was obtained by an arrangement of the chemical composition of the side groups based on structure-activity relationships (SAR). A crystal structure of the HIV-1/R100943 complex demonstrated that ITU compounds are more flexible than α-APA compound. The ITU compounds showed distinct mode of binding where they bound with [...] "horseshoe" [...] or [...] "U" [...] mode. The 2,6-dichlorophenyl part of R100943 which corresponds chemically to the wing II 2,6-dibromophenyl part of the α-APA occupied the wing I part in the NNIBP whereas the 4-cyanoanilino part of R100943 occupies the wing II position in the NNIBP.R100943 inhibited HIV-1 and was considerably effective against {{a number of key}} NNRTI-resistant mutants like G190A mutation, which caused high-level resistance to <b>loviride</b> (α-APA) and nevirapine.

Tween 80 /poloxamer 188 -stabilized nanosuspensions were produced on a laboratory scale using media milling. The milling process was monitored by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and resulted in particles with a mean size of 264 +/- 14 nm and a distribution width of 59 +/- 6 nm after 4 h of milling. Co-freeze-drying of the nanosuspensions with sucrose had an inhibiting effect on nanoparticle agglomeration and yielded solid "nanopowders" that were resuspendable and homogeneous with respect to <b>loviride</b> content. X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) confirmed the presence of small <b>loviride</b> crystallites and indicated that sucrose and poloxamer 188 were crystalline. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed melting peaks of poloxamer 188, sucrose and <b>loviride.</b> Time-resolved XRPD indicated that sucrose crystallization was complete within 24 h of storage. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) suggested the formation of sheet-like matrix structures. The dissolution rate of <b>loviride</b> from the nanopowders was excellent.

We have characterized HIV- 1 resistance to <b>loviride</b> {{and the extent of}} cross-resistance to nevirapine, delavirdine, efavirenz, HBY- 097, and tivirapine in a set of 24 clinical samples from patients treated with long-term <b>loviride</b> monotherapy by using a recombinant virus assay. Genotypic changes associated with resistance were analyzed by population sequencing. Overall, phenotypic resistance to <b>loviride</b> ranged from 0. 04 to 3. 47 log 10 -fold. Resistance was observed in samples from patients who had discontinued <b>loviride</b> for up to 27 months. Cross-resistance to the other compounds was extensive; however, fold resistance to efavirenz was significantly lower than fold resistance to nevirapine. No genotypic changes were detected in three samples; these were sensitive to all of the NNRTIs tested. The most common genotypic change was the K 103 N substitution. The range of phenotypic resistance in samples containing the K 103 N substitution could not be predicted from a genotypic analysis of known NNRTI resistance-associated mutations.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial {{was to investigate the}} effect of combination antiretroviral therapy on plasma HIV- 1 RNA as measured by HIV RNA PCR and to assess the safety and tolerability of such regimens. The trial was carried out in seven European countries, Australia and Canada and involved antiretroviral-naive patients (n = 106) with CD 4 counts between 150 - 300 cells/mm 3 (CDC group A) and 150 - 500 cells/mm 3 (CDC group B/C). Patients were randomly assigned to zidovudine (200 mg three times daily) plus lamivudine (300 mg twice daily) or to zidovudine plus lamivudine plus <b>loviride</b> (100 mg three times daily) for 52 weeks. The main outcome measures were degree and duration of reduction of plasma HIV- 1 RNA as measured by RNA PCR and the development of drug-related toxicities sufficiently severe to warrant dose modification, interruption or permanent discontinuation. A mild, though statistically significant difference in favour of zidovudine plus lamivudine plus <b>loviride</b> for log 10 plasma HIV- 1 RNA (P = 0. 022), as compared to zidovudine plus lamivudine, was observed using area-under-the-curve minus baseline (AUCMB).

Study design: An open, case-controlled, pharmacokinetic and 24 -week continuous treatment pilot study. Patients: Twenty p 24 antigen-positive patients, 10 per treatment group, were matched according to p 24 antigenaemia less or more than 100 pg, CD 4 count less or more than 150 x 10 (6) / 1, and gender. Eight out of 10 cases and seven out of 10 Controls had received previous antiretroviral therapy. Results: No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed. Both treatment combinations were well tolerated. Median absolute and percentage CD 4 count increases above baseline were more pronounced in the triple combination arm than in the double combination arm. Median p 24 -antigen and plasma viraemia level decreases below baseline were more pronounced in the triple combination arm. The M(184) I/V mutation was detected in all plasma samples of triple combination patients examined at week 12. Mutations conferring resistance to <b>loviride</b> and ZDV were found in a significant subset of patients in both treatment arms. Conclusions: Both combination regimens have an excellent safety/tolerability profile, but {{a higher level of}} in vivo efficacy is achieved by the triple combination, despite genotypic changes conferring resistance to one or all of these agents. The conclusions drawn are limited by small population size and the heterogenous pretreatment history.

The HIV inhibitors studied were the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) zidovudine and lamivudine, the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) nevirapine, delavirdine and <b>loviride,</b> the acyclic nucleoside phosphonate RT inhibitor (R) - 9 -(2 -phosphonylmethoxypropyl) adenine (tenofovir) and the protease inhibitors (PIs) saquinavir, indinavir and ritonavir. The compounds, at 50 and 500 times their 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC(50), determined at a m. o. i. = 0. 01), were added immediately after virus adsorption and removed after an incubation period of 0 (wash control), 24, 48 or 72 h. Virus breakthrough was monitored by microscopical examination of cytopathicity, viral infectivity (yield) and p 24 levels in the supernatant. The presence of HIV- 1 (HTLV-III(B)) proviral DNA was determined after a 72 -h incubation period. None of the antiviral drugs studied was able to prevent resumption of viral growth after removal of the compound. Tenofovir, lamivudine and the NNRTIs nevirapine, delavirdine and <b>loviride,</b> at 500 times their respective IC(50), were able to delay viral breakthrough for approximately 2 - 3 days. The NRTI zidovudine and the PIs saquinavir, indinavir and ritonavir, under the same conditions, were not able to delay viral breakthrough at all. Virus recovered upon treatment proved as sensitive to the anti-HIV drugs as wild-type virus. Our results suggest that viral replication at the cellular level was not completely inhibited by drug monotherapy. Consequently, virus rebounded when drug therapy stopped. In conclusion, our findings suggest that drug holidays would result in viral breakthrough, even after virus replication has been previously suppressed by adequate drug levels. status: publishe...|$|E

The hallmark of NNRTI {{has been based on}} their ability to interact with a specific site ('pocket') of HIV- 1 RT. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether, in addition to HIV- 1, different strains of HIV- 2 (ROD and EHO) and SIV (mac 251, agm 3 and mndGB 1) are sensitive to a selection of NNRTI i. e. delavirdine, the HEPT derivative I-EBU (MKC- 442), 8 -chloro-TIBO (tivirapine), alpha-APA (<b>loviride),</b> nevirapine and the pyridinone derivative L- 697, 661. METHODS AND RESULTS: The NNRTI tested inhibited the replication of the different strains of HIV- 2 and SIV at micromolar concentrations. The inhibitory effects of the NNRTI on HIV- 2 -induced cytopathicity correlated well with their inhibitory effects on HIV- 2 RT activity. Drug-resistant HIV- 2 (EHO) variants containing the Ser 102 Leu and/or Glu 219 Asp mutations in their RT were selected after passaging the virus in MT- 4 cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of delavirdine. The EHO virus mutants were at least 20 -fold less susceptible to the antiviral effects of delavirdine. Some cross-resistance, depending on the mutant strain, was observed with the other NNRTI tested (i. e. MKC- 442, tivirapine, <b>loviride</b> and pyridinone L- 697, 661). CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that NNRTI are not exclusively specific for HIV- 1 but are also inhibitory to different HIV- 2 and SIV strains. These observations will have important implications for the development of new NNRTI with higher activity against both HIV- 1 and HIV- 2. Furthermore, in view of their anti-SIV activity, NNRTI could be evaluated further for their in vivo anti-retrovirus efficacy in non-human primate models. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|D-alpha-Tocopherol {{polyethylene}} glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) -stabilized nanosuspensions (25 wt%, {{relative to the}} drug weight) were produced by media milling for 9 model drug compounds [cinnarizine, griseofulvin, indomethacin, itraconazole, <b>loviride,</b> mebendazole, naproxen, phenylbutazone and phenytoin]. After 3 months of storage at room temperature, Ostwald ripening occurred {{in all of the}} samples, except for indomethacin. Whereas lowering the temperature could slow down the ripening, it markedly increased upon storage at 40 degrees C. As for ripening, settling generally became more pronounced at 40 degrees C compared to 4 degrees C. As the nanosuspensions were afflicted by Ostwald ripening and settling, we explored nanosuspension drying as a strategy to circumvent these stability issues. Spray-drying and freeze-drying were evaluated for nanosuspensions and coarse reference suspensions of the compounds. Nanoparticle agglomeration could be visually observed in all of the powders. To evaluate the effect of agglomeration on the key characteristic of drug nanocrystals (i. e. rapid dissolution), dissolution experiments were performed under poor sink conditions. It was found that the compounds could be categorized into 3 groups: (i) compounds for which it was impossible to differentiate between coarse and nanosized products (griseofulvin, mebendazole, naproxen), (ii) compounds that gave clear differences in dissolution profiles between the nanosized and the coarse products, but for which drying of the nanosuspensions did not decrease the dissolution performance of the product (indomethacin, <b>loviride,</b> phenytoin) and (iii) compounds that showed differences between coarse and nanosized products, but for which drying of the nanosuspensions resulted in a significant decrease of the dissolution rate (cinnarizine, itraconazole, phenylbutazone). To gain insight on the influence of the drug compound characteristics on the dissolution of the dried products, the dissolution behavior of the compounds of the second and the third group was linked to the compound's characteristics. It was found that compounds with a more hydrophobic surface resulted in agglomerates which were harder to disintegrate, for which dissolution was compromised upon drying. The same was found for compounds having higher log P values. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Inhibitors {{of human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase (RT) are widely used {{in the treatment of}} HIV infection. <b>Loviride</b> (an alpha-APA derivative) and HBY 097 (a quinoxaline derivative) are two potent non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs) that have been used in human clinical trials. A major problem for existing anti-retroviral therapy is the emergence of drug-resistant mutants with reduced susceptibility to the inhibitors. Amino acid residue 103 in the p 66 subunit of HIV- 1 RT is located near a putative entrance to a hydrophobic pocket that binds NNRTIs. Substitution of asparagine for lysine at position 103 of HIV- 1 RT is associated with the development of resistance to NNRTIs; this mutation contributes to clinical failure of treatments employing NNRTIs. We have determined the structures of the unliganded form of the Lys 103 Asn mutant HIV- 1 RT and in complexes with <b>loviride</b> and HBY 097. The structures of wild-type and Lys 103 Asn mutant HIV- 1 RT in complexes with NNRTIs are quite similar overall {{as well as in the}} vicinity of the bound NNRTIs. Comparison of unliganded wild-type and Lys 103 Asn mutant HIV- 1 RT structures reveals a network of hydrogen bonds in the Lys 103 Asn mutant that is not present in the wild-type enzyme. Hydrogen bonds in the unliganded Lys 103 Asn mutant but not in wild-type HIV- 1 RT are observed between (1) the side-chains of Asn 103 and Tyr 188 and (2) well-ordered water molecules in the pocket and nearby pocket residues. The structural differences between unliganded wild-type and Lys 103 Asn mutant HIV- 1 RT may correspond to stabilization of the closed-pocket form of the enzyme, which could interfere with the ability of inhibitors to bind to the enzyme. These results are consistent with kinetic data indicating that NNRTIs bind more slowly to Lys 103 Asn mutant than to wild-type HIV- 1 RT. This novel drug-resistance mechanism explains the broad cross-resistance of Lys 103 Asn mutant HIV- 1 RT to different classes of NNRTIs. Design of NNRTIs that make favorable interactions with the Asn 103 side-chain should be relatively effective against the Lys 103 Asn drug-resistant mutant. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Of the {{multitude}} of reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors that have been pursued {{for the treatment of}} HIV infections, nine compounds (viz. zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine, stavudine, lamivudine, saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir and nevirapine) have been approved and several others (i. e. adefovir dipivoxyl [bis(POM) -PMEA], PMPA, bis(POC) -PMPA, 1592 U 89, delavirdine, <b>loviride,</b> MKC- 442, nelfinavir and VX- 478) are under clinical development. All these compounds can select for mutations in the reverse transcriptase or protease that confer various degrees of resistance or diminished susceptibility to the compounds. Both the reverse transcriptase and protease are able to accumulate multiple mutations in their genome, thus engendering high-level resistance. To avoid drug resistance from emerging it is recommended to use from the beginning combinations of the different drugs at sufficiently high (that is maximal tolerated) doses. If installed as soon as possible after infection, when it has become evident that the virus is replicating, these drug combinations may achieve a pronounced and sustained virus suppression. This should be reflected by a dramatic reduction of viral load in both the plasma and lymphnodes. With the most effective drug combination regimens, the viral load may even fall under the threshold of detection, and this may clinically translate into an arrest or prevention of progression to AIDS. status: publishe...|$|E

The RT-coding region was cloned from a new HIV- 1 group O isolate from Spain, expressed inEscherichia coli,and purified by affinity chromatography. This new RT showed 79 % amino acid sequence identity with the corresponding enzyme of group M subtype B strain BH 10. The two enzymes showed very similar kinetics of RNA-dependent DNA polymerization using homopolymeric template-primers and RNase H specific activity. Inhibitor sensitivity to ddTTP and 3 ′-azido- 2 ′, 3 ′-dideoxythymidine triphosphate (AZTTP) was also similar for both enzymes. However, the two enzymes differed dramatically in their sensitivity to several inhibitors. While the RT of the BH 10 isolate was sensitive to nevirapine and <b>loviride</b> (IC 50 ranged from 0. 16 to 8. 2 μM,depending on the substrates used), the enzyme of the Spanish HIV- 1 group O isolate showed high-level resistance to those compounds (IC 50 > 200 μM).

40|$|Estimates {{are that}} around 70 % of todays drug {{candidates}} are handicapped by poor aqueous solubility. As gastrointestinal dissolution {{is a prerequisite}} for absorption, it is evident that the exposure of these drug candidates will be little to zero after oral administration as such. However, experience with a variety of formulation approaches, so called supersaturating drug delivery systems (SDDS), has shown that intraluminal concentrations of a drug are not necessarily limited by their thermodynamicsolubility in gastrointestinal fluids. Drugs may be in solution at a concentration exceeding the solubility, i. e., in a state of supersaturation. However, the supersaturated state is thermodynamically unstable and, on itself, the driving force for precipitation. As long as supersaturated drugs do not precipitate from this thermodynamic unstable condition, intestinal absorption may be enabled. Considering the vast potential of the supersaturation concept for oral delivery of poorly water soluble drug candidates, industry and academia show a growing interest in studying both induction of supersaturation and subsequent precipitation. Since the added value of gastrointestinal supersaturation will depend on its stability in vivo, efficient exploitation of this strategy requires in vitro evaluation procedures predictive for the behavior of supersaturation inducing formulations in vivo. However, the current knowledge onthe effects of gastrointestinal physiology (including the composition of gastrointestinal fluids, gastrointestinal transit, hydrodynamics and transepithelial transport rate) on drug supersaturation/precipitation is extremely limited, hampering the implementation of biorelevant supersaturation assays in drug and formulation development. The research performed in the framework of this thesis therefore investigated the impact of different biorelevant aspects on drug supersaturation and precipitation to provide the insights needed to advance the biorelevance of the current supersaturation evaluation. As it is extremely difficult to demonstrate drug supersaturation in situ in the intraluminal environment, in a first step, human gastric and intestinal fluids representative for fastedand fed state conditions, were aspirated from healthy volunteers, to serve as biorelevant in vitro test medium for exploring the potential of supersaturation. As such, the supersaturation/precipitation behavior of various poorly soluble drugs (itraconazole, etravirine, <b>loviride,</b> danazol, ritonavir, fenofibrate and glibenclamide) was evaluated in vitro in human gastrointestinal aspirates. The results clearly illustrated that supersaturation of drug compounds with different physicochemical characteristics can be created and maintained up to a certain degree in human gastrointestinal fluids representing different nutritional states, validating the potential of supersaturating drug delivery systems, in vivo. The stability of the induced supersaturation proved to be compound- and medium-dependent. Comparison of the supersaturation stability in human gastric fluids versus fasted state human intestinal fluids indicated inferior supersaturation stability in human gastric fluids. Regarding the effect of food on supersaturation behavior, it was illustrated for allcompounds, except for itraconazole, that supersaturation stability was reduced in postprandial conditions. In addition to the studies performedin human gastrointestinal aspirates, commonly used gastric and intestinal simulation media and simple buffer solutions were benchmarked for their predictive value in a supersaturation/precipitation context. The supersaturation/precipitation behavior in human gastric fluids was adequately predicted using fasted state simulated gastric fluids (FaSSGF). In contrast, SGF overestimated supersaturation stability in 3 out of 5 cases suggesting that the use of FaSSGF is to be preferred for the biorelevant evaluation of drug precipitation in a gastric environment. To predict precipitation kinetics in the intestinal environment, simple aqueous buffer solutions at pH 6. 5 should be avoided as they significantly overestimate the stability of supersaturation. The commonly used FaSSIF performs reasonably well in predicting the precipitation behavior in fasted state human fluids. For the fed state, in contrast, fed state simulated intestinal fluid (FeSSIF) may significantly underestimate precipitation. In a second step, the potential of various excipients to inhibit drug precipitation was evaluated in human gastrointestinal aspirates and compared to the excipient mediated precipitation inhibition obtained commonly used artificial media. The extent to which precipitation inhibition could be obtained appeared to be medium, compound and excipientdependent. Experiments using human intestinal fluids from volunteers inthe fasted or fed state evidenced that the nutritional state did not significantly affect the extent of excipient-mediated precipitation inhibition. Achieving substantial excipient-mediated precipitation inhibition in human gastric fluids or FaSSGF proved to be difficult with only modest effects of Eudragit® E PO and HPMC-E 5 and no effect of PVP K 25. Takinginto account the limited supersaturation stability in human gastric fluids and the modest capacity of excipients to slow down gastric precipitation, one could argue that supersaturation should be targeted to the small intestine. Precipitation inhibition studies performed in human intestinal fluids provide evidence that cellulosic polymers posses the potential to decelerate drug precipitation, possibly resulting in enhanced absorption of low solubility compounds. The usefulness of simple aqueous buffers or simulated intestinal fluids representative for the fasted or fed state as solvent systems to predict excipient-mediated precipitationinhibition in human intestinal fluids appeared to be limited, illustrating the need for further evaluation of media for supersaturation screening. However, since lack of supersaturation stabilization by a given excipient in aqueous buffer or simulated intestinal fluids was always confirmed in human intestinal fluids, elimination of excipients based on screening tests in simple media appears feasible. Since in the intestinal tract, absorption might serve as an alternative for precipitation of supersaturated drug molecules, precipitation kinetics might be altered in an absorption environment compared to a non-absorption environment. Therefore, in a last step, the impact of supersaturation/precipitation on transepithelial transport and vice versa was investigated. The interplaybetween absorption and supersaturation was investigated by comparing classic precipitation assessment in a non-absorption environment with precipitation/permeation assessment in an absorption environment for the poorly soluble drug <b>loviride.</b> While absorption was clearly enhanced when supersaturation was induced, subsequent precipitation also proved to limitthe absorption enhancement. Through comparison of precipitation in absorption versus non-absorption setups, this study explicitly revealed, forthe first time, that, <b>loviride</b> precipitation is overestimated in a non-absorption environment. Consequently, the added value of precipitation inhibitors was also overestimated in a non-absorption setup. These results confirm the hypothesis that absorption in vivo could serve as an alternative for drug precipitation. As such, ignoring permeation is detrimental for accurate prediction of the impact of supersaturation on absorption. Implementing transepithelial permeation into in vitro precipitation assays will therefore be crucial for the efficient development of supersaturating drug delivery systems. In conclusion, this dissertation research has demonstrated that, although very complex, supersaturation and excipient mediated precipitation inhibition are feasible in human gastrointestinal fluids and provides a better understanding of intraluminal supersaturation under biorelevant conditions. Different artificial media were validated for their predictive capacity towards human gastrointestinal fluid and absorption was identified as a precipitation altering factor. Integration of the obtained knowledge in non-clinical evaluation procedures will improve their biorelevance and contribute to the successful exploitation of the supersaturation concept as absorption-enhancing strategy in the future. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} {{of the in}} vivo biopharmaceutical performance of oral drug formulations is critical to efficient drug development. Traditionally, in vitro evaluation of oral drug formulations has focused on disintegration and dissolution testing for quality control (QC) purposes. The connection with in vivo biopharmaceutical performance has often been ignored. More recently, the switch to assessing drug products in a more biorelevant and mechanistic manner has advanced the understanding of drug formulation behavior. Notwithstanding this evolution, predicting the in vivo biopharmaceutical performance of formulations that rely on complex intraluminal processes (e. g. solubilization, supersaturation, precipitation [...] .) remains extremely challenging. Concomitantly, the increasing demand for complex formulations to overcome low drug solubility or to control drug release rates urges {{the development of new}} in vitro tools. Development and optimizing innovative, predictive Oral Biopharmaceutical Tools is the main target of the OrBiTo project within the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) framework. A combination of physico-chemical measurements, in vitro tests, in vivo methods, and physiology-based pharmacokinetic modeling is expected to create a unique knowledge platform, enabling the bottlenecks in drug development to be removed and the whole process of drug development to become more efficient. As part of the basis for the OrBiTo project, this review summarizes the current status of predictive in vitro assessment tools for formulation behavior. Both pharmacopoeia-listed apparatus and more advanced tools are discussed. Special attention is paid to major issues limiting the predictive power of traditional tools, including the simulation of dynamic changes in gastrointestinal conditions, the adequate reproduction of gastrointestinal motility, the simulation of supersaturation and precipitation, and the implementation of the solubility-permeability interplay. It is anticipated that the innovative in vitro biopharmaceutical tools arising from the OrBiTo project will lead to improved predictions for in vivo behavior of drug formulations in the GI tract. © 2013 Elsevier B.
