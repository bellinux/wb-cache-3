50|$|Meningeal carcinomatosis is a {{condition}} in which a solid tumor diffusely spreads to the <b>leptomeninges.</b> Lung tumors, breast tumors, and malignant melanoma comprise the majority of solid tumors spreading to the <b>leptomeninges.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{arachnoid}} and {{pia mater}} together are {{sometimes called the}} <b>leptomeninges,</b> literally [...] "thin meninges" [...] (λεπτός leptos - thin). Acute meningococcal meningitis can lead to an exudate within the <b>leptomeninges</b> along {{the surface of the}} brain. Because the arachnoid is connected to the pia by cob-web like strands, it is structurally continuous with the pia, hence the name pia-arachnoid or <b>leptomeninges.</b> They are responsible for the production of beta-trace.|$|E
50|$|Macroscopic {{findings}} include purulent exudates, opaque <b>leptomeninges</b> (thinning of meninges), pus, and ventriculitis/ ependymitis.|$|E
50|$|An acute {{progressive}} pyogranulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis {{is seen in}} mature Pointer dogs. There is monocytic and neutrophilic {{infiltration of}} the <b>leptomeninges.</b> Symptoms include incoordination, reluctance to move, and neck rigidity.|$|E
50|$|Leptomeningeal {{metastasis}} (LM) {{is a rare}} {{complication of}} systemic cancer in which the <b>leptomeninges</b> are infiltrated by cancer cells. The overall incidence is 3-8% but is increasing as more cancer patients survive following initial treatment.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A brain autopsy demonstrating {{signs of}} meningitis. The forceps (center) are {{retracting}} the dura mater (white). Underneath the dura mater are the <b>leptomeninges,</b> which {{appear to be}} edematous and have multiple small hemorrhagic foci.|$|E
50|$|The tumors most {{frequently}} {{spread through the}} CSF. As a result, metastases frequently occur along the central nervous system, particularly in the <b>leptomeninges.</b> In rare cases, metastases {{have been reported to}} spread to the abdomen and extra-cranial sites.|$|E
50|$|Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma usually {{develops}} {{within the}} supratentorial region (the {{area of the}} brain located above the tentorium cerebelli). It is generally located superficially (in the uppermost sections) in the cerebral hemispheres, and involves the <b>leptomeninges.</b> It rarely arises from the spinal cord.|$|E
50|$|At these sites, the parasites {{lodge and}} form cysts, {{producing}} imflammatory reactions and clinical issues when they die, sometimes causing serious or fatal damage. In the eye, the parasites can cause visual loss, and {{infection of the}} spine and adjacent <b>leptomeninges</b> can cause paresthesias, pain, or paralysis.|$|E
50|$|Audiometry shows a {{progressive}} sensineural deafness. Visual examination shows optic atrophy {{and an increase}} in the blind spot. CT is usually normal but may show enlargement of the ventricles. MRI with contrast may show enhancement of <b>leptomeninges</b> and cochlea consistent with chronic meningitis. EEG shows is non specific with slow waves and spike discharges.|$|E
50|$|Nasal glial heterotopia {{refers to}} {{congenital}} malformations of displaced normal, mature glial tissue, which {{are no longer}} in continuity with an intracranial component. This is distinctly different from an encephalocele, which is a herniation of brain tissue and/or <b>leptomeninges,</b> that develops through a defect in the skull, where there is a continuity with the cranial cavity.|$|E
50|$|Neurocutaneous {{melanosis}} {{is associated}} with the presence of either giant congenital melanocytic nevi or non-giant nevi of the skin. It is estimated that neurocutaneous melanosis is present in 2% to 45% of patients with giant congenital melanocytic nevi. Neurocutaneous melanosis is characterized by the presence of congenital melanocytic nevi on the skin and melanocytic tumors in the <b>leptomeninges</b> of the central nervous system.|$|E
5000|$|The {{arachnoid}} mater {{covering the}} brain {{is referred to as}} the [...] "arachnoidea encephali," [...] and the portion covering the spinal cord as the [...] "arachnoidea spinalis." [...] The arachnoid and pia mater are sometimes considered as a single structure, the leptomeninx, or the plural version, <b>leptomeninges.</b> ("Lepto"- from the Greek root meaning [...] "thin"). Similarly, the dura in this situation is called the pachymeninx.|$|E
50|$|All these {{transporters}} {{are highly}} hydrophobic proteins with 12 transmembrane segments, extracellular glycosylation sites, and intracellular consensus sites for phosphorylation, {{and there is}} over 50% amino acid homology between each of them. Each binds GABA with varying affinities with BGT1 having the lowest affinity and GAT3 the highest. GAT2 (SLC6A13) is predominantly expressed in hepatocytes in the liver, but {{is also found in}} proximal tubules in the kidney {{as well as in the}} <b>leptomeninges</b> and in some blood vessels in the brain.|$|E
50|$|Approximately 10% {{of patient}} with neurocutaneous {{melanosis}} also present the Dandy-Walker syndrome and associated Dandy-Walker malformation. This malformation involves an {{enlargement of the}} posterior fossae and fourth ventricle along with agenesis of the cerebellar vermis. The abnormalities of the <b>leptomeninges</b> during fetal development due to neurocutaneous melanosis may {{be the cause of}} this increased incidence of the Dandy-Walker malformation. The development of hydrocephalus is the most common symptom associated with a combination of neurocutaneous melanosis and a Dandy-Walker malformation, occurring in about 2 out of 3 patients.|$|E
50|$|Imaging {{has been}} shown to be the only {{reliable}} detection method for the presence of neurocutaneous melanosis that can be performed in living patients. Currently, the preferred imaging modality for diagnosis of neurocutaneous melanosis is Magnetic Resonance Imaging, although ultrasound is another viable option. The signal due melanin deposits in the <b>leptomeninges</b> typical of neurocutaneous melanosis can be easily detected in MRI scans of patients under 4 months old. In patients above this age, there is some suggestion that normal brain myelination may partially obscure these signals.|$|E
5000|$|Meningioangiomatosis is a {{rare disease}} of the brain. It is {{characterized}} by a benign lesion of the <b>leptomeninges</b> usually involving the cerebral cortex, and by leptomeningeal and meningovascular proliferation. Often the patient will present with seizures. The disease may be either sporadic or associated with neurofibromatosis type 2. The lesion is usually focused in one place, though extremely rare multifocal cases have been reported in both adults and children. [...] Biopsy is usually necessary for diagnosis. Treatment conventionally involves surgical removal of the lesion.|$|E
50|$|In contrast, {{macroscopic}} {{changes have}} not been reported for fetuses infected after they become immunocompetent for PPV. Microscopic lesions are primarily endothelial hypertrophy and mononuclear cell infiltrations consistent with an immune response. Meningoencephalitis characterized by perivascular cuffing with proliferating adventitial cells, histiocytes, and a few plasma cells {{was seen in the}} gray and white matter of the cerebrum and in the <b>leptomeninges</b> of PPV-infected stillborn pigs. These lesions were believed to be pathognomonic for PPV infection. Similar lesions have been observed in PPV-infected, live fetuses collected late in gestation (Fig. 7B).|$|E
5000|$|Neurocutaneous {{melanosis}} {{is associated}} with the presence of either giant congenital melanocytic nevi or non-giant nevi of the skin. It is estimated that neurocutaneous melanosis is present in 2% to 45% of patients with giant congenital melanocytic nevi. Patients with non-giant congenital melanocytic nevi seem to have a much lower, but undefined risk. Of these patients, only a small number are symptomatic, usually displaying symptoms before the age of 2. These symptoms are the result of melanocytic lesions being present in the <b>leptomeninges</b> of the central nervous system.Symptoms can include: ...|$|E
50|$|NM is a {{secondary}} cancer {{meaning that it}} is the result of neoplastic cells that have metastasized from a primary cancer site. These cancers develop an enzyme that is able to break down blood vessels at a microscopic level. These cells enter the blood vessels and travel across the body. Once the brain is reached, they break down the Blood-Brain Barrier to enter the Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF). There the cancerous cells seed and disseminate into the <b>leptomeninges</b> which are composed of the arachnoid and the pia. The CSF continues to carry neoplastic cells through the brain tracts and spreads the cancerous cells.|$|E
50|$|Neurocutaneous {{melanosis}} is a congenital disorder {{characterized by}} the presence of congenital melanocytic nevi on the skin and melanocytic tumors in the <b>leptomeninges</b> of the central nervous system. These lesions may occur in the amygdala, cerebellum, cerebrum, pons, and spinal cord of patients. Although typically asymptomatic, malignancy occurs in the form of leptomeningeal melanoma in over half of patients. Regardless of the presence of malignancy, patients with symptomatic neurocutaneous melanosis generally have a poor prognosis with few treatment options. The pathogenesis of neurocutaneous melanosis is believed {{to be related to the}} abnormal postzygotic development of melanoblasts and mutations of the NRAS gene.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} types of {{intracranial}} metastasis: brain metastasis, dural metastasis, and leptomeningeal metastasis. Brain metastasis can be single or multiple and involve any portion of the brain. Metastasis to dural structures generally occurs by hematogenous spread or direct invasion from a contiguous bone. Dural metastases can invade the underlying brain and cause focal edema and associated neurologic symptoms. These processes tend to cause seizures early in the course because of their cortical location. Metastasis to the <b>leptomeninges</b> is an uncommon but well-recognized clinical presentation in cancer patients. Leptomeningeal metastasis most commonly is due to breast, lung, or melanoma primary tumors.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that the structure of VRS in the cerebral cortex {{may contribute to the}} development of Alzheimer’s disease. In contrast to VRS of the basal ganglia, VRS in the cerebral cortex are surrounded by only one layer of <b>leptomeninges.</b> As such, VRS in the cerebral cortex may drain β-amyloid in interstitial fluid less effectively than VRS in the basal ganglia. The less-effective drainage may lead to the development of the β-amyloid plaques that characterize Alzheimer’s disease. In support of this hypothesis, studies have noted the greater frequency of β-amyloid plaques in the cerebral cortex than in the basal ganglia of Alzheimer’s disease patients.|$|E
50|$|The {{mammalian}} betaine transporter (BGT1; SLC6A12) {{is predominantly}} {{expressed in the}} liver (hepatocytes). It is also expressed in the kidney where it is regulated by NFAT5 during a response to osmotic stress. Further, BGT1 is also present in the <b>leptomeninges</b> surrounding the brain. Deletion of the BGT1 gene in mice {{did not appear to}} have any impact on the tendency to develop epilepsy. This is to be expected considering that BGT1 is expressed at far lower levels than GAT1 and also has lower affinity for GABA. This implies that it is not likely to contribute significantly to the inactivation of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA.|$|E
5000|$|Arachnoiditis is an {{inflammatory}} {{condition of the}} arachnoid mater or 'arachnoid', one of the membranes known as meninges that surround and protect the nerves of the central nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord. The arachnoid can become inflamed because of adverse reactions to chemicals, infection from bacteria or viruses, {{as the result of}} direct injury to the spine, chronic compression of spinal nerves, complications from spinal surgery or other invasive spinal procedures, or the accidental intrathecal injection of steroids intended for the epidural space. Inflammation can sometimes lead to the formation of scar tissue and adhesion that can make the spinal nerves [...] "stick" [...] together, a condition where such tissue develops in and between the <b>leptomeninges.</b> The condition is extremely painful, especially when progressing to adhesive arachnoiditis. Another form of the condition is arachnoiditis ossificans, in which the arachnoid becomes ossified, or turns to bone, and is thought to be a late-stage complication of the adhesive form of arachnoiditis.|$|E
5000|$|Perivascular {{spaces are}} gaps {{containing}} interstitial fluid that span between {{blood vessels and}} the brain matter which they penetrate. Like the blood vessels around which they form, perivascular spaces are found in both the subarachnoid space and the subpial space.Perivascular spaces surrounding arteries in the cerebral cortex and the basal ganglia are separated from the subpial space by one or two layers of <b>leptomeninges,</b> respectively, {{as well as the}} pia mater. By virtue of the leptomeningeal cell layer, the perivascular spaces belonging to the subarachnoid space are continuous with those of the subpial space. The direct communication between the perivascular spaces of the subarachnoid space and the subpial space is unique to the brain’s arteries, as no leptomeningeal layers surround the brain’s veins. Use of the scanning electron microscope has determined that the spaces surrounding blood vessels in the subarachnoid space are not continuous with the subarachnoid space {{because of the presence of}} pia mater cells joined by desmosomes.|$|E
5000|$|Pia mater is the thin, translucent, mesh-like meningeal envelope, {{spanning}} {{nearly the}} entire surface of the brain. It is absent only at the natural openings between the ventricles, the median aperture, and the lateral aperture. The pia firmly adheres {{to the surface of}} the brain and loosely connects to the arachnoid layer. [...] Because of this continuum, the layers are often referred to as the pia arachnoid or <b>leptomeninges.</b> A subarachnoid space exists between the arachnoid layer and the pia, into which the choroid plexus releases and maintains the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The subarachnoid space contains trabeculae, or fibrous filaments, that connect and bring stability to the two layers, allowing for the appropriate protection from and movement of the proteins, electrolytes, ions, and glucose contained within the CSF. Romanian biologist Viorel Pais, through recent electron microscopy studies, has demonstrated for the first time in the specialty literature that pia mater is formed by cordocytes and blood vessels.|$|E
50|$|Bing-Neel {{syndrome}} (BNS) is {{an extremely}} rare neurologic complication of Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM), which is a chronic lymphoproliferative disorder.There's no clear definition of BNS but what is known so far is that unlike WM, It involves {{the central nervous system}} (CNS), infiltrated by differentiated malignant B cells and by having hyperglobulinemia. This infiltration increases blood viscosity, which impairs blood circulation through small blood vessels of the brain and the eye. Some scientists proposed that a person diagnosed with BNS is typically classified into Group A and Group B depending on whether or not plasma cells are present within the brain parenchyma, <b>leptomeninges,</b> dura, and/or the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). Symptoms are diverse and nonspecific, and they can vary depending on which aspect of the CNS is being affected. Symptoms can include a range of severity of nausea and seizures. Since the symptoms vary, there are multiple treatment options to treat the symptoms for this non-curable disease. Although there is no specific set of diagnosis for BNS, different combinations of diagnostic tools are used to narrow down and conclude the presence of BNS.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{localization}} of prostaglandin D receptor in {{the mouse}} brain was examined by {{in situ hybridization}} histochemistry. The autoradiography showed significant hybridization signals of mRNA for prostaglandin D receptor in the <b>leptomeninges</b> covering {{the surface of the}} brain, but not in neurons or glia in the brain parenchyma. This finding was confirmed by Northern blot analysis using mRNA prepared from either the whole brain with the <b>leptomeninges,</b> brain parenchyma without the <b>leptomeninges</b> or the <b>leptomeninges</b> alone. A weak signal corresponding to the major 3. 5 -kbp transcript was detected in the whole brain. This band was significantly enriched in the <b>leptomeninges,</b> but was not detected in the brain parenchyma. These results suggest that prostaglandin D receptor is most highly, if not exclusively, expressed in the <b>leptomeninges</b> of the mouse brain...|$|E

Magnetic resonance imaging showed nodular lesions on the cerebellar and pontine surface and thickening of the thoracic spinal <b>leptomeninges.</b> Throughout {{the course of the}} disease, contrast enhancement was detected in the spinal <b>leptomeninges</b> but not intracranially. Primary diffuse leptomeningeal gliomatosis (PDLG) was diagnosed by biopsy and later confirmed on necropsy. The present case is remarkable for the nodular superficial cerebellar lesions and the absence of intracranial contrast enhancement of the <b>leptomeninges.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Primary melanocytosis of the <b>leptomeninges</b> {{is a rare}} tumor, {{most likely}} {{originating}} from the melanocytes in the <b>leptomeninges.</b> The average survival is only about 5 months. Case report. A 61 - years-old woman presented with headache, amaurosis and hallucinations lasted for two months, {{and she had been}} treated at the Clinic for Psychiatry and Clinic for Infectious Diseases. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed a lower level of glucose and a higher level of proteins. Small shaded areas of basal <b>leptomeninges</b> and hydrocephalus were found by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The autopsy showed a dark brown mass on basal <b>leptomeninges</b> with blurred boundaries. No pigmented skin lesions were found. Histopathological analysis revealed a primary leptomeningeal melanocytosis. Conclusion. Primary leptomeningeal melanocytosis is a rare tumor, difficult to diagnose. This case is being presented for its specificity, since this diagnosis is not frequently seen in practice...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Transmembrane {{resistance}} {{is a measure}} of ionic permeability. The occurrence of ionic permeability on the leptomeningeal tissue may suggest its contribution to the cerebrospinal fluid turnover. This property will support the background for a new in vitro model for the study of subarachnoid physiology. The aim {{of this study is to}} identify the occurrence and mean value of transmembrane resistance of <b>leptomeninges</b> in sheep at the basal state. Methods: Cranial leptomeningeal tissues from 26 adult sheep were isolated. Electrophysiological measurements were performed with the Ussing system. Histological samples of leptomeningeal tissue were prepared under light microscopy and hematoxylin-eosin staining. Results: The mean transmembrane resistance of the <b>leptomeninges</b> in sheep was found to be 11. 38 +/- 1. 28 Omega cm(2). The histological preparations revealed the homology with the <b>leptomeninges</b> of humans under light microscopy. Discussion: Leptomeningeal tissue demonstrates ionic permeability as it was indicated by the measured transmembrane resistance. The low transmembrane resistance observed is comparable to a 'leaky' epithelium. The observation of transmembrane resistance might reflect a mesothelial type of activity. This novel property of <b>leptomeninges</b> may be involved in cerebrospinal fluid turnover...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} shows that neural stem/ progenitor cells (NSPCs) can be activated in the nonconventional neurogenic zones such as the cortex following ischemic stroke. However, the precise origin, identity, and subtypes of the ischemia-induced NSPCs (iNSPCs), which can contribute to cortical neurogenesis, is currently still unclear. In our present study, using an adult mouse cortical infarction model, {{we found that the}} <b>leptomeninges</b> (pia mater), which is widely distributed within and closely associated with blood vessels as microvascular pericytes/perivascular cells throughout central nervous system (CNS), have NSPC activity in response to ischemia and can generate neurons. These observations indicate that microvascular pericytes residing near blood vessels that are distributed from the <b>leptomeninges</b> to the cortex are potential sources of iNSPCs for neurogenesis following cortical infarction. In addition, our results propose a novel concept that the <b>leptomeninges,</b> which cover the entire brain, have an important role in CNS restoration following brain injury such as stroke...|$|E
40|$|Glutathione-independent {{prostaglandin}} D synthase [prostaglandin-H 2 D-isomerase; (5 Z, 13 E) -(15 S) - 9 alpha, 11 alpha-epidioxy- 15 -hydroxyprosta- 5, 13 -dienoate D-isomerase, EC 5. 3. 99. 2] is {{an enzyme}} responsible for biosynthesis of prostaglandin D 2 {{in the central}} nervous system. In situ hybridization with antisense RNA for the enzyme indicated that mRNA for the enzyme was predominantly expressed in the <b>leptomeninges,</b> choroid plexus, and oligodendrocytes of the adult rat brain. The findings agree with those obtained by immunohistochemical staining with antibodies against the enzyme. It was further revealed that prostaglandin D synthase activity was considerably greater in the isolated <b>leptomeninges</b> (14. 2 nmol per min per mg of protein) and choroid plexus (7. 0 nmol per min per mg of protein) than the activity in the whole brain (2. 0 nmol per min per mg of protein). These results, taken together, indicate that the enzyme is mainly synthesized and located in the <b>leptomeninges,</b> choroid plexus, and oligodendrocytes in the brain...|$|E
30|$|Mediastinal neuroenteric cysts are {{anomalous}} protrusions of the <b>leptomeninges</b> through intervertebral foramen or {{defects in}} the vertebral body. They {{are associated with}} multiple vertebral anomalies and with neurofibromatosis [15, 16].|$|E
40|$|Although {{previous}} {{studies in the}} field of NSPC biology have focused on neuroepithelial cells that originate from the neural tube, our recent studies demonstrated that ischemiainduced NSPCs (iNSPCs) are induced in stroke-affected areas and originate, at least in part, from brain pericytes residing near blood vessels that are distributed from the <b>leptomeninges</b> to the cortex. Because brain pericytes, including the <b>leptomeninges,</b> are neural crest derivatives and iNSPCs express various neural crest markers, these findings provide a novel concept that neural crest-derived cells can {{play a crucial role in}} central nervous system (CNS) as NSPCs after brain injury...|$|E
