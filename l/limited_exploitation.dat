40|$|ABSTRACT. The use {{of marine}} {{protected}} areas (MPAs) {{as a basic}} management tool to <b>limit</b> <b>exploitation</b> rates in marine fisheries has been widely suggested. Models are important in predicting the consequences of management decisions and the design of monitoring programs in terms of policy goals. However, few tools are available that consider both multiple fleets and ecosystem scale dynamics. We use a new applied game theory tool, Ecoseed, that operates within a temporally and spatially explicit biomass dynamics model, Ecopath with Ecosim, to evaluate the efficacy of marine protected areas in the North Sea in both ecological and economic terms. The Ecoseed model builds MPAs based on the change in values of predicted economic rents of fisheries and the existence value of biomass pools in the ecosystem. We consider the market values of four fisheries operating in the North Sea: a traw...|$|R

Just extra function units are, however, little beneficial in non-numerical applications since control dependence severely <b>limits</b> <b>exploitation</b> of instruction-level parallelism (ILP) and frequent branches consume ILP due to its long latency. Boosting is an interesting technique to reduce control dependence. It allows general speculative execution with little cycle time penalty. From the cost/performance point of view, we propose the efficient implementation of boosting, which requires the small support hardware and maximizes performance gain from boosting in the limited hardware. We also propose a new branch scheme to reduce the branch penalty which has a particularly big performance impact in a parallel issue machine. Our scheme fetches from both directions of the branch with small hardware cost through integration of a code movement and hardware support. We evaluate our schemes and fi [...] ...|$|R

Under the assumption that agents remain in the system for significant time periods, or that the agent composition changes only slowly, we have previously presented a prescriptive strategy for promoting and sustaining cooperation in the group. This strategy was shown to improve both individual and group performance in the long run. Our prescribed strategy has been an adaptive, probabilistic, reciprocity-based policy for deciding which other individual to cooperate with. In this paper we investigate two mechanisms to <b>limit</b> <b>exploitation</b> of the reciprocative strategy by deceptive agents : 1) a penalty factor for declining requests for help, and 2) a cutoff limit on outstanding balance of help.

Under extreme conditions, however, the process {{may no longer be}} probabilistic. Those that meet certain conditions survive and may reproduce while others perish. By introducing the corresponding binary birth-death dynamics to spatial evolutionary games, we observe solutions that are fundamentally different from those reported previously based on imitation dynamics.

Strategies that dominate are those that are collectively most apt in meeting the survival threshold, rather than those who succeed in exploiting others for unfair benefits. Revisiting Darwinian principles with the focus on survival rather than imitation thus reveals the most counterintuitive ways of reconciling cooperation with competition.

40|$|When {{selecting}} a resource to exploit, an insect colony {{must take into}} account at least two constraints: the resource must be abundant enough to sustain the whole group, but not too large to <b>limit</b> <b>exploitation</b> costs, and risks of conflicts with other colonies. Following recent results on cockroaches and ants, we introduce here a behavioral mechanism that satisfies these two constraints. Individuals simply modulate their probability to switch to another resource {{as a function of the}} local density of conspecifics locally detected. As a result, the individuals gather at the smallest resource that can host the whole group, hence reducing competition and exploitation costs while fulfilling the overall group’s needs. Our analysis reveals that the group becomes better at discriminating between similar resources as it grows in size. Also, the discrimination mechanism is flexible and the group readily switches to a better suited resource as it appears in the environment. The collective decision emerges through the self-organization of individuals, that is, in absence of any centralized control. It also requires a minimal individual cognitive investment, making the proposed mechanism likely to occur in other social specie...|$|R
