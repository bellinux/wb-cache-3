50|$|Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is an {{uncommon}} syndrome that {{is due to}} the presence of leukocyte antibodies in transfused plasma. TRALI is believed to occur in approximately one in every 5000 transfusions. <b>Leukoagglutination</b> and pooling of granulocytes in the recipient's lungs may occur, with release of the contents of leukocyte granules, and resulting injury to cellular membranes, endothelial surfaces, and potentially to lung parenchyma. In most cases <b>leukoagglutination</b> results in mild dyspnea and pulmonary infiltrates within about 6 hours of transfusion, and spontaneously resolves.|$|E
50|$|Occasionally {{more severe}} lung injury occurs {{as a result}} of this {{phenomenon}} and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) results. Leukocyte filters may prevent TRALI for those patients whose lung injury is due to <b>leukoagglutination</b> of the donor white blood cells, but because most TRALI is due to donor antibodies to leukocytes, filters are not helpful in TRALI prevention. Transfused plasma (from any component source) may also contain antibodies that cross-react with platelets in the recipient, producing usually mild forms of posttransfusion purpura or platelet aggregation after transfusion.|$|E
40|$|Results {{of testing}} sera from normal {{individuals}} and pathological patients, using a bromelin technique {{for the detection}} of leukoagglutinins, are reported. These results, supported further by an in vivo experiment, suggested that the phenomenon of <b>leukoagglutination</b> is immunologic in nature and that leukoagglutinins may be the cause of some febrile transfusion reactions. These are specifically directed against leukocytes, and do not involve the red cell series. Furthermore, the antigen (or antigens) is probably present in both the granulocytes and the mononuclear leukocytes. Anti-platelet antibodies could be presumed to be the cause of thrombocytopenia...|$|E
40|$|The mitogenic agent, {{phytohemagglutinin}} (PHA), {{added to}} human mixed leukocyte cultures and to lymphocyte cultures converted small lymphocytes into lymphoblasts and increased lymphocyte susceptibility to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Maximum virus yields were 30 - to 1, 000 -fold higher in PHA-treated than in control cultures. VSV replicated to peak titers before lymphocytes were morphologically transformed by PHA, and virus titers fell as lymphoblast destruction began. PHA neither induced significant VSV replication in polymorphonuclear leukocyte cultures, nor increased the large virus yields in monocyte cultures. The treatment of PHA with heat, digestive enzymes, rabbit anti-PHA serum and serial dilutions failed to dissociate {{that portion of}} the PHA extract responsible for the conversion of lymphocytes into virus-susceptible cells from those components responsible for <b>leukoagglutination</b> or lymphocyte transformation...|$|E
40|$|THE {{desirability}} of a suitable method of serological diagnosis for the avian leukosis complex {{has long been}} recognized. Numerous investigations have shown {{that there is an}} antibody response in fowls to the agent of avian leukosis. (Johnson, 1945; Olson 1945; Lee, 1942; Kabat and Furth, 1940). However, as yet no practi-cal method of detecting these specific antibodies has been developed. (Stafseth, 1941). It has been demonstrated that animals may produce antibodies against their own tissue, especially if there is a foreign agent closely associated with the tissue against which the antibody is formed. Investiga-tions have suggested that the agent of avian leukosis is closely associated with the blood cells because of the difficulty in obtaining filtrates which are as potent as whole blood. Agglutinins against human white blood cells have been demonstrated by means of tube <b>leukoagglutination</b> and used to dif-ferentiate various types of leukemia...|$|E
40|$|Cardiopulmonary {{effects of}} cuprophaneâ€“activated plasma in the swine. Hemodialysis with cuprophane {{membrane}} {{is associated with}} complement activation {{and the formation of}} anaphylatoxins. Frequently, it is also complicated by various adverse reactions which include hypoxemia and hemodynamic changes. This study examined the cardiopulmonary effects of cuprophane membrane on experimental animals. To support the hypothesis that these effects were mediated by complement activation products, the effects of zymosan-activated plasma and C 5 adesArg challenge on the same variables were compared. We showed that intravenous infusion of autologous cuprophane-activated plasma into swine produced severe pulmonary hypertension, hypoxemia and leukopenia. In addition, mean systemic arterial pressure fluctuated and cardiac output fell. Infusion of zymosan-activated plasma produced similar results, suggesting that complement activation products are responsible for these alterations. Similar responses to porcine C 5 adesArg infusion suggested further that this polypeptide was the mediator. When swine were subjected to extracorporeal circulation using cuprophane membrane but without dialysis, acute pulmonary hypertension was seen preceding the onset of significant leukopenia. These data suggest that blood contact with cuprophane membrane produces both pulmonary and systemic hemodynamic changes, which are mediated by complement activation products. Furthermore, these products and/or other humoral factors, but not <b>leukoagglutination,</b> cause the pulmonary hypertension...|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} {{antibody}} response to human platelet transfusions, nine thrombocytopenia patients with bone marrow failure were given 6 U (3 X 10 (11)) of random platelet concentrates twice a week. Before transfusion, {{none of the}} patients had preexisting antibodies detectable with lymphocytotoxicity, platelet aggregation, or capillary <b>leukoagglutination</b> techniques. After receiving 18 - 78 U of platelets, they became refractory to further transfusions of random platelets and alloantibodies were detectable. Two patterns of antibody response could be identified. In three patients, the sera were not lymphocytotoxic with a panel of standard cells {{in which all the}} known HLA antigens in the first and second series were represented at least once. Yet, they caused platelet aggregation with 30, 24, and 60 %, respectively, of a donor population studied. The aggregating activities were inhibited by antihuman IgG but not by antihuman IgA or antihuman IgM antiserum. The aggregating antibodies could be absorbed out with donor platelets but not lymphocytes or granulocytes. Antibodies from two of these patients aggregated platelets of their respective siblings matched for both HLA haplotypes. Transfusion of platelets from these two siblings did not increase the platelet count while platelets obtained from aggregation-negative donors did. The sera from the remaining six patients were lymphocytotoxic with 15 - 100 % of the panel of standard cells. They also had aggregating antibodies, which could be absorbed out by both platelets and lymphocytes, suggesting that they were HLA antibodies. These data suggest that the development of platelet-specific antibodies may {{play an important role in}} the immunological rejection of isologous platelets, and should be considered in the selection of donors for patients who are refractory to platelets from random donors...|$|E
