2500|$|As of April 2008, the British {{government}} added swords with {{a curved}} blade of 50cm (20in) or over in length ("the {{length of the}} blade shall be the straight <b>line</b> <b>distance</b> {{from the top of}} the handle to the tip of the blade") to the Offensive Weapons Order. [...] This ban was a response to reports that samurai swords were used in more than 80 attacks and four killings over the preceding four years. Those who violate the ban would be jailed up to six months and charged a fine of £5,000. Martial arts practitioners, historical re-enactors and others may still own such swords. The sword can also be legal provided it was made in Japan before 1954, or was made using traditional sword making methods. It is also legal to buy if it can be classed as a [...] "martial artist's weapon". This ban applies to England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. This ban was amended in August 2008 to allow sale and ownership without licence of [...] "traditional" [...] hand-forged katana.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Health studies {{sometimes}} rely on {{postal code}} location {{as a proxy}} for the location of residence. This study compares the postal code location to that of the street address using a database from the Alberta Provincial Project for Outcome Assessment in Coronary Heart Disease (APPROACH ©). Cardiac catheterization cases in an urban Canadian City were used for calendar year 1999. We determined location in meters for both the address (using the City of Calgary Street Network File in ArcView 3. 2) and postal code location (using Statistic Canada's Postal Code Conversion File). Results The distance between the two estimates of location for each case were measured and it was found that 87. 9 % of the postal code locations were within 200 meters of the true address location (straight <b>line</b> <b>distances)</b> and 96. 5 % were within 500 meters of the address location (straight <b>line</b> <b>distances).</b> Conclusions We conclude that postal code locations are a reasonably accurate proxy for address location. However, there may be research questions for which a more accurate description of location is required. </p...|$|R
