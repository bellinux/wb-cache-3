2500|$|The podaegi ( [...] , also spelled podegi) is a Korean carrier with {{a medium}} to large {{rectangle}} of fabric {{hanging from a}} very <b>long</b> <b>strap.</b> Traditionally the rectangle is quilted for warmth and wraps around the mother's torso, while the straps are wrapped snug under the baby's bottom and tied {{around to the front}} to support and secure the baby on the mother's back. Western interest in the podaegi style has led to new wrapping methods which do go over the shoulders, and to narrower [...] "blankets". Variants of this shape include the Iu-Mienh/Hmong carrier and the Chinese bei bei. Iu-Mienh/Hmong carriers and bei beis are both customarily used with over-the-shoulder wrapping and often have stiff sections which help provide head support or block wind.|$|E
60|$|Another moment {{found me}} {{at the top of}} the {{partition}} wall again with the boy beside me. Unbuckling my harness I snapped it together with a single <b>long</b> <b>strap</b> which I lowered to the waiting Xodar below. He grasped the end and was soon sitting beside us.|$|E
60|$|Then {{making a}} noose of the <b>longest</b> <b>strap,</b> {{he watched his}} chance and dropped it over the brute’s neck.|$|R
5000|$|Other ways to {{circumvent}} the need for authentic equipment include [...] "hiding" [...] plastic bottles (usually by wrapping them in cloths or furs), using [...] "bindings" [...] (<b>long</b> <b>straps</b> of cloth or fur) to make inauthentic footgear look more adequate, or simply hiding coolboxes inside wooden chests.|$|R

60|$|She turned {{round with}} a {{somewhat}} languid greeting. A tall, well-made man, a little past middle-age, in gaiters and light tweed coat, had stepped out {{on to the}} balcony {{from one of the}} open windows. In his right hand he was swinging carelessly backwards and forwards by a <b>long</b> <b>strap</b> a well-worn letter-bag.|$|E
60|$|With many {{deep and}} hearty {{thanks for the}} {{kindness}} he had shown them, the boys parted from him, and, setting their faces to the west, took the road to Odessa. Jack carried his crutches on his shoulders, as also the <b>long</b> <b>strap</b> which, when he used them, was to pass over his neck, and down under his foot, keeping it off the ground.|$|E
60|$|He wore, {{hanging with}} a <b>long</b> <b>strap</b> round his neck, {{a kind of}} scrip or wallet, in which to carry food. The widow set some bread and cheese before him, but he thanked her, and said that through the {{kindness}} of the charitable he had broken his fast once since morning, and was not hungry. When he had made her this reply, he opened his wallet, {{and took out a}} few pence, which was all it appeared to contain.|$|E
60|$|We {{waited to}} hear no more. Slinging my harness into a <b>long</b> single <b>strap,</b> I lowered Tars Tarkas to the {{courtyard}} beneath, and {{an instant later}} dropped to his side.|$|R
50|$|The Deception {{template}} {{was maintained}} for the 2011 reboot with minor differences. Ermac's outfit was more form-fitting with the mask neater in presentation and conformed {{to the shape}} of his head, but emphasis was placed on black with the red palette a darker carmine and reduced to trimming on the tabard and on the underarm and outer thigh sections of the suit. A new cosmetic addition was two <b>long</b> <b>straps,</b> similar to the ones that extended {{from the back of his}} mask, that dangled from his forearms, and the green gems and their placement remained unchanged, with the forehead mount smaller in size.|$|R
50|$|Reins or Lines. <b>Long</b> leather <b>straps</b> (occasionally ropes) {{running from}} the bit to the driver's hands, used to guide the horses. In teams of several animals these may be joined {{together}} so the driver only need hold one pair.|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my word," [...] said old Peter, {{resting his}} pipe-hand {{on his knee}} and looking steadfastly at me, [...] "you're the queerest {{fisherman}} I've see'd yet. Nigh every year, some {{two or three of}} 'em stop here in the fishin' season, and there was never a man who didn't bring his jinted pole, and his reels, and his lines, and his hooks, and his dry-goods flies, and his whiskey-flask with a <b>long</b> <b>strap</b> to it. Now, if you want all these things, I haven't got 'em." ...|$|E
6000|$|While they {{uncovered}} the sheaves he stood apathetic beside his portable repository of force, round whose hot blackness the morning air quivered. He {{had nothing to}} do with preparatory labour. His fire was waiting incandescent, his steam was at high pressure, in a few seconds he could make the <b>long</b> <b>strap</b> move at an invisible velocity. Beyond its extent the environment might be corn, straw, or chaos; it was all the same to him. If any of the autochthonous idlers asked him what he called himself, he replied shortly, [...] "an engineer." ...|$|E
6000|$|So {{he began}} unharnessing the Sawhorse, and Button-Bright and Dorothy helped him. When they had removed the harness, the Patchwork Girl {{told them to}} take it all apart and buckle the straps together, end to end. And after they had done this, they found they had one very <b>long</b> <b>strap</b> that was {{stronger}} than any rope. [...] "It would reach across the gulf easily," [...] said the Lion, who with the other animals had sat on his haunches and watched this proceeding. [...] "But I don't see how it could be fastened to one of those dizzy mountains." ...|$|E
50|$|Opanci {{made with}} a broad sole {{covering}} the foot with upper part covering the toes, originally tied round the foot and legs with <b>long</b> leather <b>straps.</b> In the inter-war period buckled opanky first appeared, and are still worn in some rural areas by men.|$|R

5000|$|... "Through-{{registered}} pouches" [...] {{were not}} only made of canvas, but had several thick staples at the top where a <b>long</b> leather <b>strap</b> passed through and locked for extra security. These pouches that transported registered mail between large cities were made with leather bottoms for extra strength.|$|R
60|$|It was {{the fourth}} of July and a crowd was at the station, but though I {{recognized}} half the faces, {{not one of them}} lightened at sight of me. The 'bus driver, the ragged old dray-man (scandalously profane), the common loafers shuffling about, chewing and spitting, seemed absolutely unchanged. One or two elderly citizens eyed me closely as I slung my little Boston valise with a <b>long</b> <b>strap</b> over my shoulder and started up the billowing board sidewalk {{toward the center of the}} town, but I gave out no word of recognition. Indeed I took a boyish pride in the disguising effect of my beard.|$|E
60|$|All this I saw indistinctly and by much effort: for my {{personal}} condition had been greatly changed during slumber. I now lay upon my back, and at full length, on {{a species of}} low framework of wood. To this I was securely bound by a <b>long</b> <b>strap</b> resembling a surcingle. It passed in many convolutions about my limbs and body, leaving at liberty only my head, and my left arm to such extent that I could, by dint of much exertion, supply myself with food from an earthen dish which lay by my side on the floor. I saw, to my horror, that the pitcher had been removed. I say to my horror; for I was consumed with intolerable thirst. This thirst {{it appeared to be}} the design of my persecutors to stimulate: for the food in the dish was meat pungently seasoned.|$|E
60|$|What {{he looked}} he felt. He {{was in the}} {{agricultural}} world, but not of it. He served fire and smoke; these denizens of the fields served vegetation, weather, frost, and sun. He travelled with his engine from farm to farm, from county to county, for as yet the steam threshing-machine was itinerant {{in this part of}} Wessex. He spoke in a strange northern accent; his thoughts being turned inwards upon himself, his eye on his iron charge, hardly perceiving the scenes around him, and caring for them not at all: holding only strictly necessary intercourse with the natives, as if some ancient doom compelled him to wander here against his will in the service of his Plutonic master. The <b>long</b> <b>strap</b> which ran from the driving-wheel of his engine to the red thresher under the rick was the sole tie-line between agriculture and him.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>strap,</b> a <b>long</b> leather <b>strap</b> {{that reaches}} from the butt {{end of the}} rifle to {{about two-thirds of the}} way to the nose of the rifle. The strap has {{functional}} and visual purposes, and it is also used to produce a snapping sound. The strap is similar to a firearm's sling.|$|R
60|$|Clinging to {{the wall}} with my feet and one hand, I unloosened one of the <b>long</b> leather <b>straps</b> of my trappings {{at the end of}} which dangled a great hook by which air sailors are hung to the sides and bottoms of their craft for various {{purposes}} of repair, and by means of which landing parties are lowered to the ground from the battleships.|$|R
5000|$|A Chinchinero is {{an urban}} street {{performer}} in Chile, usually {{a man or}} young boy, who plays a bass drum-type percussion instrument with <b>long</b> drumsticks <b>strapped</b> to his back which also involves a rope with a noose tied around the performer's foot to play the cymbals which also form part of this improvised instrument. Said instrument has been invented and produced informally and can carry any rhythm or melody.|$|R

50|$|The espantoon is {{an ornate}} wooden baton, {{equipped}} with a <b>long</b> swiveled leather <b>strap</b> for twirling. It originated, and is still strongly associated, with the Baltimore Police Department {{in the city of}} Baltimore, Maryland. The term is considered distinctly Baltimorean.|$|R
50|$|Another {{equivalently}} famous apparel is the Xhubleta-clothing. A xhubleta is a bell wavy skirt {{which is}} held by two straps on the shoulders, worn {{on top of a}} long sleeved white linen shirt. It’s texture consists of long suspended <b>long</b> black <b>straps</b> etched in the material, which was usually chestnut velvet. The socks and shoes were the same as the pështjellak clothing. In the Rugova region (Kosovar West) the xhubleta clothing was worn especially after the Second World War.|$|R
30|$|We {{routinely}} {{apply the}} body casts under general endotracheal anesthesia. Following endotracheal intubation, a bite block is placed {{to protect the}} tongue and cheeks, {{as well as the}} tube, from accidental bite as traction is applied with a halter strap. A cast t-shirt is placed on the patient and two stacked towels are placed under the t-shirt to prevent the cast from being too tight. A stockinet may be used instead of the cast t-shirt. A towel is wrapped around the patient’s occiput and covers the ears as well as the eyes. This towel helps protect the ears from the pressure of the halter strap and is also useful to protect the face from the saw dust {{at the end of the}} procedure. Then, a halter strap is placed around the occiput and under the chin. <b>Long</b> <b>straps</b> are cut from a cloth wrap and placed around the patient’s waist above the iliac wings on both sides. These straps are placed over the cast t-shirt to prevent skin irritation during removal. The patient is then transferred onto the cast frame. Different cast frames are available commercially depending on the surgeon’s preference.|$|R

50|$|Gahnia aspera {{known as}} the rough saw-sedge or round sawsedge is a tussock forming {{perennial}} plant, often seen in moist situations. The <b>long</b> <b>strap</b> like leaves grow to 80 cm long.|$|E
5000|$|The {{dramatic}} {{curvature of}} the bows makes stringing them very different from straighter bows found in Europe. There is an old saying in Turkey that there are [...] "120 ways to string a bow," [...] though the most common methods involve sitting on ground with one's feet pressed against the grip. Heavier bows usually {{require the use of}} a <b>long,</b> looped <b>strap</b> called a [...] "kemend" [...] to pull the limbs back and hold them while the string is seated.|$|R
5000|$|Gauchos dressed quite {{distinctly}} from North American cowboys, {{and used}} bolas or boleadoras - in Portuguese boleadeiras - (three leather bound rocks tied together with approximately three feet <b>long</b> leather <b>straps)</b> {{in addition to}} the familiar [...] "North American" [...] lariat or riata. The typical gaucho outfit would include a poncho (which doubled as a saddle blanket and as sleeping gear), a facón (large knife), a rebenque (leather whip), and loose-fitting trousers called bombachas, belted with a tirador, or a chiripá, a loincloth. During winters, gauchos wore heavy wool ponchos to protect against cold.|$|R
25|$|Traditional babywearing in Japan {{was done}} with a wrap carry, using an obi (sash). In the 1940s, a carrier known as the onbuhimo became popular. Similar to the Hmong and Mei tai carriers, the onbuhimo has <b>long</b> top <b>straps</b> and a {{rectangular}} body. But {{at the bottom of}} the rectangle, loops or rings allow the top straps to be threaded through and tightened, while the straps are tied at the waist. The body is much smaller than the bodies of most mei tais and other Asian-style carriers, and the onbuhimo is traditionally used on the back. Variations may have stiff headrests or padding in the body.|$|R
