50|$|A Lock keeper, Lock Tender, or <b>lock</b> <b>operator</b> {{looks after}} a canal or river lock, {{operating}} {{it and if}} necessary maintaining it or organizing its maintenance. Traditionally, lock keepers live on-site, often in a small purpose-built cottage. A lock keeper {{may also be the}} operator for the lock's Weir, and in many cases lock keepers {{play an important role in}} moderating and controlling water levels in response to drought and heavy rain. With the decline in commercial traffic the occupation is dying out, at least in Britain. Many previously manned locks are now unmanned.|$|E
40|$|A ship {{colliding with}} a lock gate {{can result in}} severe {{structural}} damage and disrupt the lock operations. For heavily trafficked waterways containing locks such disruption of the lock operation can result in severe economic consequences if the gate has to be repaired, both for the <b>lock</b> <b>operator</b> and for the delayed ships. Consequently, {{the consequences of a}} ship colliding with a lock gate must be assessed. Therefore, this paper will present current regulatory requirements and recommendations including gate protection systems. Furthermore, simulation methods will be presented to allow for a direct assessment of the structural consequences. Thus, these methods will potentially lead to new structural design considerations as well as operational limitations in terms of specific ship approach velocities to remain below critical impact energies and thus allow for an undisrupted lock operation.

The ten uppermost ones (locks 5 through 14) are now operated by the Kentucky River Authority.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} dense coding scheme between one sender and two receivers, which {{guarantees}} that the receivers simultaneously obtain their respective messages. In our scheme, the quantum entanglement channel is first locked by the sender {{so that the}} receivers cannot learn their messages unless they collaborate to perform the unlocking operation. We also show that the quantum Fourier transform can act as the <b>locking</b> <b>operator</b> both in simultaneous dense coding and teleportation. Comment: 8 pages, comments are welcom...|$|R
40|$|Simultaneous dense coding {{guarantees}} that Bob and Charlie simultaneously receive their respective information from Alice {{in their respective}} processes of dense coding. The idea {{is to use the}} so-called locking operation to "lock" the entanglement channels, thus requiring a joint unlocking operation by Bob and Charlie in order to simultaneously obtain the information sent by Alice. We present some new results on simultaneous dense coding: (1) We propose three simultaneous dense coding protocols, which use different $N$-dimensional entanglement (Bell state, W state and GHZ state). (2) Besides the quantum Fourier transform, two new <b>locking</b> <b>operators</b> are introduced (the double controlled-NOT operator and the SWAP operator). (3) In the case that spatially distant Bob and Charlie have to finalise the protocol by implementing the unlocking operation through communication, we improve our protocol's fairness, with respect to Bob and Charlie, by implementing the unlocking operation in series of steps. (4) We improve the security of simultaneous dense coding against the intercept-resend attack. (5) We show that simultaneous dense coding can be used to implement a fair contract signing protocol. (6) We also show that the $N$-dimensional quantum Fourier transform can act as the <b>locking</b> <b>operator</b> in simultaneous teleportation of $N$-level quantum systems.

50|$|A Tunnel {{boring machine}} {{was used for}} the construction. Manufactured by the German firm, Herrenknecht, it arrived in Australia in October 1996. While the use of a Tunnel boring machine {{relieved}} the need for large numbers of workers at increased pressure, a caisson system is formed at the cutting head. Workers entering this space for inspection, maintenance and repair had to be trained. Medical direction was utilised for planning compression and decompression, assessment of fitness to dive, training of workers and <b>lock</b> <b>operators,</b> health monitoring of workers and treatment of related injuries. This project was the first time oxygen decompression tables were used for caisson work in Australia. The incidence of decompression illness was 1 case in every 286 pressurisations (0.35%) and this problem affected 5.9% of the workers.|$|R
50|$|The {{network is}} {{designed}} {{to minimize the risk}} of having both empty and full docking stations. In order to achieve this, the size of the stations varies with the expected volume. Furthermore, if a bicycle is to be docked in a full station, there are extra stands with non-physical docking capability to which the bicycles can be attached. Each bicycle is equipped with an additional lock which sends an alert to network <b>operators</b> if <b>locked.</b> Then <b>operators</b> can intervene and reallocate bicycles.|$|R
40|$|All of the {{previously}} described effects of integration host factor (IHF) on bacteriophage Mu development have supported the view that IHF favours transposition‐replication over the alternative state of lysogenic phage growth. In this report we show that, consistent with a model in which Mu repressor binding to its operators requires a particular topology of the operator DNA, IHF stimulates repressor binding to the Ol and O 2 operators and enhances Mu repression. IHF would thus {{be one of the}} keys, besides supercoiling and the H‐NS protein, that <b>lock</b> the <b>operator</b> region into the appropriate topological conformation for high‐affinity binding not only of the phage transposase but also of the phage repressor.

I must explain that Flatbroke was fifteen miles away; I was then at Swan Creek, the State capital.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, most bus services, whether {{local or}} {{intercity}} originated {{from the city}} centre, especially in the areas around Jalan Tun Tan Cheng <b>Lock.</b> Recently transport <b>operators</b> have decided to unilaterally move operations elsewhere. For example, executive bus operators, especially those headed for Singapore, have switched to less congested locations like the Kuala Lumpur Railway Station, KL Sentral, Bangsar and Petaling Jaya. Rapid KL itself has shifted operations to its city hubs. The government meanwhile has been encouraging buses to use other newer terminals like Pasarakyat and Duta Bus Terminal.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere {{are many}} {{mechanisms}} for concurrency control in high-level programming languages. In Java, the original mechanism for concurrency control, based on synchronized blocks, is lexically scoped. For more flexible control, Java 5 introduced non-lexical lock primitives on re-entrant <b>locks.</b> These <b>operators</b> {{may lead to}} run-time errors and unwanted behavior; e. g., taking a lock without releasing it, {{which could lead to}} a deadlock, or trying to release a lock without owning it. This paper develops a static type and effect system to prevent the mentioned lock errors for a formal, object-oriented calculus which supports non-lexical lock handling and exceptions. Based on an operational semantics, we prove soundness of the effect type analysis. Challenges {{in the design of the}} effect type system are dynamic creation of threads, objects, and especially of locks, aliasing of lock references, passing of lock references between threads, and reentrant locks as found in Java. Furthermore, the exception handling mechanism complicates the control-flow and thus the analysis...|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of Minuteman missile launch crews, once a launch order is received, both {{operators}} must {{agree that it is}} valid by comparing the authorization code in the order against a Sealed Authenticator (a special sealed envelope which holds the code). These Sealed Authenticators are stored in a safe which has two separate <b>locks.</b> Each <b>operator</b> has the key to only one lock, so neither can open the safe alone. Also, each operator has one of two launch keys; once the order is verified, they must insert the keys in slots on the control panel and turn them simultaneously. A total of four keys are thus required to initiate a launch. For additional protection, the missile crew in another launch control center must do the same for the missiles to be launched. As a further precaution, the slots for the two launch keys are positioned far enough apart to make it impossible for one operator to reach both of them at once.|$|R
5000|$|Some adherents {{identified}} the Instagram account of Alefantis {{and pointed to}} some of the photos posted there as evidence of the conspiracy. Many of the images shown were friends and family who had liked Comet Ping Pong's page on Facebook. In some cases, imagery was taken from unrelated websites and claimed to be Alefantis' own. The restaurant's owners and staff were harassed, threatened on social media websites, and the owner received death threats. The restaurant's Yelp page was <b>locked</b> by the <b>operators</b> of the site citing reviews that were [...] "motivated more by the news coverage itself than the reviewer's personal consumer experience".|$|R
5000|$|Steam engines {{frequently}} possess {{two independent}} mechanisms for {{ensuring that the}} pressure in the boiler does not go too high; one may be adjusted by the user, the second is typically designed as an ultimate fail-safe. Such safety valves traditionally used a simple lever to restrain a plug valve {{in the top of}} a boiler. One end of the lever carried a weight or spring that restrained the valve against steam pressure. Early valves could be adjusted by engine drivers, leading to many accidents when a driver fastened the valve down to allow greater steam pressure and more power from the engine. The more recent type of safety valve uses an adjustable spring-loaded valve, which is <b>locked</b> such that <b>operators</b> may not tamper with its adjustment unless a seal illegally is broken. This arrangement is considerably safer.|$|R
40|$|A {{mechanical}} connection system comprises a first body {{defining a}} receptable {{and a second}} body defining a pin matingly receivable in the receptacle by relative movement in a first directional mode. A primary latch is engagable between the two bodies to retain the pin in the receptacle. The primary latch is reciprocable in a second directional mode transverse to the first directional mode. A lock member carried {{by one of the}} bodies is operatively associated with the primary latch and movable, transverse to the second directional mode, between a locking position maintaining engagement of the primary latch and a releasing position permitting release of the primary latch. The <b>lock</b> includes an <b>operator</b> portion engagable to move the lock member from its locking position to its releasing position. The operator is located internally of the first body. An actuator is selectivity insertable into and disengagable from the first body. The actuator is movable relative to the first body when it is inserted for engagement with and operation of the operator...|$|R
50|$|Akron {{was one of}} {{the first}} Mafia cities in the 20th century Midwest. The Black Hand, led by Don Rosario Borgio, who arrived in Akron in the early 1900s, was {{headquartered}} on the city's north side. Using a general goods store as a front, Borgio set up two back rooms for illegal operations. All of the gambling and brothels in the city were subjected to extortion, along with wealthy citizens of the Italian North Hill neighborhood. In 1918 the Akron Police Department started aggressively raiding Borgio's gambling and prostitution houses, <b>locking</b> up the <b>operators</b> and patrons. Due to the interference, Borgio held a meeting in his store with Black Hand leaders, giving the order to slay all the police in the city, offering a $250 reward for each one killed. The order led to the murders of Officers Robert Norris, Edward Costigan, Joe Hunt, and Gethin Richards. Following the case filed against him by New York Detective Fiaschetti over the slayings, Borgio was executed in the electric chair. After the execution Mafia activity in Akron greatly decreased. As in most cities, by the 21st century, mob activity had vanished.|$|R
