40|$|AICPA {{auditing}} standards (e. g., AU-C 210, par. 11) for audits of nonissuers require CPA auditors to use engagement letters or another suitable written understanding to clarify their {{and their clients}} ’ duties; these letters also minimize CPAs ’ potential legal <b>liabilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>clients.</b> But, the SEC, PCAOB and other authoritative bodies prohibit those clauses-fear-ing their use would impair auditors ’ independence. We survey 209 CPAs ’ responses to increasing risk across three engagement letter clauses that can change the level of auditor risk exposure, and measure the amount of data and fees auditors gather relative to chang-ing engagement letter clauses in normal and unusual risk scenarios. We find that CPAs say they increase both the quantity of evidence gathered and their engagement fees in response to increasing risk, which suggests that CPAs ’ level of work depends much more on their assessment of perceived risks than on the three clauses minimizing their legal liabilities. Auditors further respond to an engagement’s aggregate risk {{in the presence of}} risk-reducing clauses. We also find that while the clauses can lower the cost of the enga-gement’s risk, auditors do not lower the amount of evidence gathered under the no...|$|E

Since the leading decision in Bridgewater v Leahy, in addition to undue influence and unconscionable bargain claims, actions based on equitable estoppel, constructive and resulting trusts, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of legislative duties that mirror equitable obligations are increasingly being brought in contemporary estate litigation. Such litigation often raises challenging issues for claimants, including evidentiary hurdles and allegations of undue delay, especially when claims are made post-mortem in relation to inter vivos dealings with property. Accordingly, solicitors need {{to ensure that they}} fully understand the nature and potential application of equitable claims in estate litigation, or face the prospect of incurring <b>liability</b> <b>to</b> <b>clients</b> for professional negligence.

50|$|CPAs may {{defend against}} {{a breach of}} {{contract}} if they can prove that the client’s loss occurred because of factors other than negligence by the auditors. If the auditor proves the loss resulted from causes other than the auditor’s negligence, a client may be accused of contributory negligence. If a state follows the doctrine of contributory negligence, the auditor may eliminate their <b>liability</b> <b>to</b> the <b>client</b> based on contributory negligence by the client. Many states do not follow this doctrine. Most states permit a jury to assess the fault and apply the correct percentage of fault to the parties involved. This is called comparative negligence.|$|R

The duties of architect in the construction stage such as inspection for make sure all the works are follow on specifications and plan and advise a client for works on credible contractor to carry the construction project. The architect will require delivering his duties with reasonable skill and care. In a case law, they are many problems related with inspection of work by architect towards a <b>client.</b> The breach <b>to</b> a <b>client</b> under on reasonable skill and care is a failure and negligence inspection.

This study found that generally, the architect owe a duty of care to perform his duty with diligent and with reasonable skill in accordance to the standard of duties stated <b>to</b> a <b>client.</b> If he fails to make inspection he is liable for resulting damages <b>to</b> his <b>client.</b> The architect cannot be claim by a client if he inspect a work with certain degree...|$|R
40|$|Construction {{professionals}} owe {{duties of}} care and skill <b>to</b> <b>clients</b> in both contract and tort. Usually the principal or the corporate employer takes responsibility for employees' negligence under the principle of vicarious liability. But analysis of court judgments from England, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Florida (USA) reveals circumstances in which professional employees might attract personal <b>liability</b> <b>to</b> the firm's <b>client,</b> despite an apparent lack of contractual or tortious relationship with that client. Professional employees of unincorporated businesses might be more exposed to this risk than employees of incorporated businesses. Factors causing professional employees to be uninsured include lack of contractual privity between client and employee and absence of compelling rules or statutes. Professional employees seem unaware of these risks. Increased awareness of these risks could encourage employees to take out insurance but clients will resist paying twice to insure the negligence of both principal and employee.

50|$|Cyber-insurance {{is a risk}} {{management}} technique via which network user risks are transferred to an insurance company, {{in return for a}} fee, i.e., the insurance premium. Examples of potential cyber-insurers might include ISP, cloud provider, traditional insurance organizations. Proponents of cyber-insurance believe that cyber-insurance would lead to the design of insurance contracts that would shift appropriate amounts of self-defense <b>liability</b> <b>to</b> the <b>clients,</b> thereby making the cyberspace more robust. Here the term ‘self-defense' implies the efforts by a network user to secure their system through technical solutions such as anti-virus and anti-spam software, firewalls, using secure operating systems, etc. Cyber-insurance has also {{the potential to be a}} market solution that can align with economic incentives of cyber-insurers, users (individuals/organizations), policy makers, and security software vendors. i.e., the cyber-insurers will earn profit from appropriately pricing premiums, network users will seek to hedge potential losses by jointly buying insurance and investing in self-defense mechanisms, policy makers would ensure the increase in overall network security, and the security software vendors could experience an increase in their product sales via forming alliances with cyber-insurers.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a new theory of civil <b>liability</b> <b>to</b> hold tax return preparers liable <b>to</b> their <b>clients</b> for tax malpractice, {{applying}} to understatements, overstatements, and non-optimal tax advice.

5000|$|Lord Brown concurred. He {{said that}} [...] "the gains to {{be derived from}} denying {{witnesses}} immunity from suit for breach of that duty substantially exceed whatever loss might be thought likely to result from this", since a potential <b>liability</b> would lead <b>to</b> a [...] "sharpened awareness of the risks of pitching their initial views of the merits of their client’s case too high or too inflexibly lest these views come to expose and embarrass them at a later date." [...] He thought that this was a [...] "healthy development". It would also ensure that a client who was caused loss by an expert witness acting in [...] "an egregious manner" [...] would receive a proper remedy; he said that such cases were likely to be [...] "highly exceptional". Lord Collins, agreeing, noted that the result did not affect the position of the expert vis-a-vis the opposing litigant, where there were [...] "wider considerations of policy" [...] against allowing claims. He also remarked that the existing ability to prosecute expert witnesses for perjury or to take disciplinary proceedings against them for unprofessional conduct in preparing or presenting their evidence did not fit with the claim that a <b>liability</b> <b>to</b> their <b>clients</b> for breach of duty would have a chilling effect on experts' willingness to give evidence. Lord Kerr, who also agreed with the decision, said that if [...] "an expert expresses an honestly held view, even if it differs from that which he may have originally expressed, provided it is an opinion which is tenable, he has nothing to fear from a disgruntled party." ...|$|R

40|$|Background Few studies {{examining}} the genetic architecture of cigarette smoking {{have focused on}} adolescents or examined developmental changes in additive genetic, shared environment and unique environmental influences on <b>liability</b> <b>to</b> initiate cigarette smoking and quantity of cigarettes smoked. The {{aim of this study}} is to add to the literature on <b>liability</b> <b>to</b> initiate and use cigarettes during adolescence using a nationally representative sample. Method Data for this study came from adolescent and young adult twin pairs (ages 14 - 33) from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. We ran a series of developmental causal-contingent-common pathway models to examine whether additive genetic, shared and unique environmental influences on <b>liability</b> <b>to</b> the initiation of cigarette use are shared with those on smoking quantity, and whether their contributions change across development. Results We found evidence for a developmental shift in genetic and shared environmental contributions to cigarette use. Early in adolescence genetic and environmental influences work independently on <b>liability</b> <b>to</b> cigarette smoking initiation and quantity of cigarettes smoked, but <b>liability</b> <b>to</b> these behaviors becomes correlated as individuals age into young adulthood. Conclusions These findings provide insight into the causal processes underlying the <b>liability</b> <b>to</b> smoke cigarettes. With age, there is greater overlap in the genetic and environmental factors that influence the initiation of cigarette smoking and quantity of cigarettes smoked...|$|R
