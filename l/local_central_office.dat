50|$|Introduced to {{the public}} in 1963 by AT&T, Touch-Tone dialing greatly {{shortened}} the time of initiating a telephone call. It also enabled direct signaling from a telephone across the long-distance network using audio-frequency tones, which was impossible with the rotary dials that generated digital direct current pulses that had to be decoded by the <b>local</b> <b>central</b> <b>office.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{technician}} {{calls the}} local telephone {{number of the}} automatic number announcement service. This call is connected to equipment at a <b>local</b> <b>central</b> <b>office</b> that uses a voice synthesizer or digital samples to announce the telephone number of the line calling in. The main purpose of this system is to allow telephone company technicians to identify the telephone line they are connected to.|$|E
50|$|Verizon High Speed Internet is {{available}} in Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, and Washington D.C where Verizon has coverage. Availability and speed {{are determined by the}} presence of a DSLAM in the <b>local</b> <b>central</b> <b>office</b> or remote terminal and the overall local loop length/distance from the C.O./RT to the customer premises. Maximum DSL connection speed decreases as the loop length increases.|$|E
25|$|Long {{distance}} switches may use a slower, {{more efficient}} switch-allocation algorithm than <b>local</b> <b>central</b> <b>offices,</b> {{because they have}} near 100% utilization of their input and output channels. <b>Central</b> <b>offices</b> have more than 90% of their channel capacity unused.|$|R
25|$|Switches {{are used}} in both <b>local</b> <b>central</b> <b>offices</b> and in long {{distance}} centers. There are two major types in the Public switched telephone network (PSTN), the Class 4 telephone switches designed for toll or switch-to-switch connections, and the Class 5 telephone switches or subscriber switches, which manage connections from subscriber telephones. Since the 1990s, hybrid Class 4/5 switching systems that serve both functions have become common.|$|R
50|$|The 1970s {{also saw}} a major <b>central</b> <b>office</b> {{technology}} evolve from crossbar electromechanical relay-based technology and discrete transistor logic to Bell Labs-developed thick film hybrid and transistor-transistor logic (TTL), stored program-controlled switching systems; 1A/#4 TOLL Electronic Switching Systems (ESS) and 2A <b>Local</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Offices</b> produced at the Bell Labs Naperville and Western Electric Lisle, Illinois facilities. This technology evolution dramatically reduced floor space needs. The new ESS also came with its own diagnostic software that needed only a switchman and several frame technicians to maintain. The technology was often touted in the Bell Labs Technical Journals and Western Electric magazine (WE People).|$|R
50|$|The {{formatting}} convention for {{phone numbers}} is (NPA) NXX-XXXX, where NPA is the {{numbering plan area code}} and NXX-XXXX is the subscriber number. The prefix NXX of the subscriber number is a code for the <b>local</b> <b>central</b> <b>office,</b> {{unique in the}} numbering plan area. The place holder N stands for the digits 2 to 9, as the subscriber number may not begin with the digits 0 and 1.|$|E
50|$|During the World War I several Jews from Oldenburg {{and nearby}} towns {{were killed in}} the battles. Plaques commemorating their names was placed in the local synagogue. In 1924, the <b>local</b> <b>central</b> <b>office</b> for the Jewish welfare was established, helping members of the {{community}} in need. Shortly after, another charity fund was founded under the name Gemilus Chassodim. In addition, a Jewish youth organization and Maccabi sports club branch were active in town, as well as the Israelite Women's association.|$|E
50|$|In North American telephony, VSCs were {{developed}} by AT&T Corp. as Custom Local Area Signaling Services (CLASS) codes, sometimes LASS, in the 1960s and 70s. Their use became ubiquitous throughout the 1990s and eventually became a recognized standard. As CLASS was an AT&T trademark, the term vertical service code {{was adopted by the}} North American Numbering Plan Administration. The use of vertical is a somewhat dated reference to older switching methods and the fact that these services can only be accessed by a local telephone subscriber, going up (vertically) inside the <b>local</b> <b>central</b> <b>office</b> instead of out (horizontally) to another telephone company.|$|E

50|$|A Class-5 {{telephone}} switch is {{a telephone}} switch or telephone exchange {{in the public}} switched telephone network located at the <b>local</b> telephone company's <b>central</b> <b>office,</b> directly serving subscribers. Class-5 switch services include basic dial-tone, calling features, and additional digital and data services to subscribers connected to a local loop.|$|R
50|$|The first {{telephones}} {{were directly}} connected to each other from one customer's office or residence to another customer's location. Being impractical beyond just a few customers, these systems were quickly replaced by manually operated centrally located switchboards. This gave rise to landline telephone service in which each telephone is connected {{by a pair of}} dedicated wires to a <b>local</b> <b>central</b> <b>office</b> switching system, which developed into fully automated systems starting in the early 1900s. For greater mobility, various radio systems were developed for transmission between mobile stations on ships and automobiles in the middle 20th century. Hand-held mobile phones were introduced for personal service starting in 1973. By the late 1970s several mobile telephone networks operated around the world. In 1983, the Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS) was launched, offering a standardized technology providing portability for users far beyond the personal residence or office. These analog cellular system evolved into digital networks with better security, greater capacity, better regional coverage, and lower cost. The public switched telephone network, with its hierarchical system of many switching centers, interconnects telephones around the world for communication with each other. With the standardized international numbering system, E.164, each telephone line has an identifying telephone number, that may be called from any authorized telephone on the network.|$|E
40|$|Published online: 09 July 2013 While the {{literature}} on directly elected mayors has largely neglected the relationship between mayors and their parties, studies of party transformation have generally ignored how changes in local democratic rules and practices affect parties. This article addresses these questions using a qualitative case study {{of the relationship between}} mayors and the three faces of their parties (in local public office, <b>local</b> <b>central</b> <b>office</b> and on the ground) in Genoa and Lausanne. Based on interviews with the mayors, elected representatives and party members, it finds in the two cases that, as long as these mayors can count on high levels of popularity and are not nearing the end of their term, they are ‘party detached’. When these factors do not apply and/or party institutionalization increases, the relationship with the party in <b>local</b> <b>central</b> <b>office</b> (although not with the party in local public office or on the ground) becomes more significant...|$|E

40|$|The North American {{telecommunications}} {{system is a}} vast network with thousands of switching nodes. The main function of the telecommunications network is to interconnect all of these nodes, {{as well as the}} telephone subscriber, with one another. The optimization of the equipment configurations to achieve these interconnections in the most economical manner presents an ideal opportunity for the application of simulation techniques. [...] The vast majority of switching centres in Newfoundland and the rest of North America employ analog technology. Most of these switches are vintage equipment and do not have the service, feature and maintenance capabilities of the newer-generation digital switches. It is generally agreed among telecommunications engineers that converting to digital will have long-term benefits. The planning problem has therefore become one of how to convert from analog to digital technology with a minimum of disruption of service and a minimum of cost. [...] The introduction of digital technology into communications has compounded the network planning problem because of the distributed nature of digital communications as well as the large amount of capital required for digital conversion. [...] This report uses system dynamics techniques to examine the planning aspects of the local telecommunication network. A model was developed which was capable of simulating up to seven <b>local</b> <b>central</b> <b>offices.</b> This model utilizes present worth of annual charges (PWAC) as the evaluator to assess a number of simulations for different planning configurations and arrives at the optimum plan for local network evolution.

5000|$|The New York Telephone Exchange fire {{occurred}} on February 27, 1975 at the New York Telephone Company switching center at 204 Second Avenue (at Thirteenth Street in lower Manhattan). At this time, the building contained a <b>local</b> exchange (<b>central</b> <b>office)</b> used to connect local customer phone lines. The fire disrupted service for 175,000 customers, {{connected to the}} building through 105,000 service loops. Just after midnight on February 27, 1975 a short circuit {{on the first floor}} of the building started the fire. Because the cables were insulated by plastic, it spread quickly to the higher levels cutting off nearly all connection to the Bell System Network. As a result, calls to the Fire Department of New York failed because the telephone lines were disconnected.In an attempt to activate the alarm in the street, a call got through to the fire department at 12:55 A.M. However, the fire was not declared under control until 3:40 A.M. Shortly after that, the fire reignited and was officially declared under control at 4:46 AM. This was the worst single service disaster suffered by any single Bell operating company in the 20th century.|$|R

50|$|A {{telephone}} exchange name or <b>central</b> <b>office</b> name was a distinguishing and memorable name {{assigned to a}} <b>central</b> <b>office.</b> It identified the switching system to which a telephone was connected. Each <b>central</b> <b>office</b> served a maximum of 10,000 subscriber lines identified by the last four digits of the telephone number. Areas or cities with more subscribers were served by multiple <b>central</b> <b>offices,</b> possibly hosted in the same building.
