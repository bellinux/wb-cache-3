5|$|After Mexico gained {{independence}} in 1821, Spain began to govern Manila directly. Under direct Spanish rule, banking, industry and education flourished {{more than they}} had in the previous two centuries. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 facilitated direct trade and communications with Spain. The city's growing wealth and education attracted indigenous people, Chinese, Indians, <b>Latinos,</b> <b>and</b> Europeans from the surrounding provinces and facilitated the rise of an ilustrado class that espoused liberal ideas: the ideological foundations of the Philippine Revolution, which sought independence from Spain.|$|E
5|$|I think I can't {{be happy}} if I'm the only one that's getting {{published}} by Random House when I know there are such magnificent writers – both <b>Latinos</b> <b>and</b> Latinas, both Chicanos and Chicanas – in the U.S. whose books are not published by mainstream presses or whom the mainstream isn't even aware of.

In League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry (2006), the Court ruled that House Majority Leader Tom DeLay's Texas redistricting plan intentionally diluted the votes of <b>Latinos</b> <b>and</b> thus violated the Equal Protection Clause.|$|E

5|$|The {{austerity}} and the passivity of {{the first}} character is, however, contrasted vividly with the passion and activity of the second character. Madonna in this portrayal wears a red voluminous extravagant Spanish style dress, which shows off her décolletage, with a middle parting in the skirt, while wearing red carnations in her hair. Complementing this passionate look, the second setting features a bright red room with red candles and candelabra. While the spiritual and pious Madonna shyly watches the <b>Latinos</b> <b>and</b> prays silently in her room, the passionate Madonna dances and leaves the room to join the dancers in the streets.|$|E

40|$|Latinos are {{the fastest}} growing ethnic {{minority}} in the United States; however statistics indicate that their college education attainment is not increasing proportionately to other ethnic groups. This study examined college aspirations, generational status, socioeconomic status (SES), perceived parental support, and gender influences among <b>Latino</b> <b>and</b> Euro- American fifth grade students (N= 111). The student sample consisted of 78 % <b>Latino</b> <b>and</b> 22 % Euro-American students. All participants completed a demographic and college aspiration questionnaire and 17 % of the students completed a face-to-face interview regarding college aspirations. It was predicted {{that there would be}} a significant difference between the college aspirations of <b>Latino</b> <b>and</b> Euro-American elementary school students; this was found in the total sample but was not found in the analysis of <b>Latino</b> <b>and</b> Euro-American students from the higher SES school. It was also hypothesized that perceived parental support would be positively related to students??? college aspirations, which was supported for both <b>Latino</b> <b>and</b> Euro- American students. Interestingly, gender differences in college aspirations were not found among Latino or Euro-American elementary school students. Implications and future directions are discussed...|$|R

50|$|The {{achievement}} gap describes the inconsistencies in standardized test scores, rates {{of high school}} and college completion, grade point average between students of color (Black <b>and</b> <b>Latino)</b> <b>and</b> White students. It is significant because White students tend to achieve far more academically compared to Black <b>and</b> <b>Latino</b> students. <b>Latino</b> <b>and</b> Black students have some of the lowest college school completion rates in the United States, on average, they also have lower literacy rates in school, and lag behind White students in terms of math and science proficiency.  It is important to understand that these discrepancies have long-term achievement effects on <b>Latino</b> <b>and</b> Black students.|$|R

25|$|Lena Lovato Archuleta (July 25, 1920 – April 3, 2011) was a Mexican-American educator, school librarian, and {{administrator}} in New Mexico and Colorado {{for more than}} three decades. In 1976 she became the first Hispanic woman principal in the Denver Public Schools system. She was also the first Hispanic president of the Denver Classroom Teachers' Association and the Colorado Library Association, and the first female president of the Latin American Education Foundation. She was instrumental in the founding of several political and community advocacy groups for <b>Latinos</b> <b>and</b> served on numerous city and community boards. Following her retirement in 1979, she became a full-time volunteer for the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP). She was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 1985.

25|$|Racial {{segregation}} {{is another}} environmental factor that occurs through the discriminatory action of those organizations and working individuals within {{the real estate}} industry, whether in the housing markets or rentals. Even though residential segregation is noted in all minority groups, blacks tend to be segregated regardless of income level when compared to <b>Latinos</b> <b>and</b> Asians. Thus, segregation results in minorities clustering in poor neighborhoods that have limited employment, medical care, and educational resources, which is associated with high rates of criminal behavior. In addition, segregation affects the health of individual residents because the environment is not conducive to physical exercise due to unsafe neighborhoods that lack recreational facilities and have nonexistent park space. Racial and ethnic discrimination adds an additional element to the environment that individuals have to interact with daily. Individuals that reported discrimination {{have been shown to}} have an increase risk of hypertension in addition to other physiological stress related affects. The high magnitude of environmental, structural, socioeconomic stressors leads to further compromise on the psychological and physical being, which leads to poor health and disease.|$|E
25|$|With {{the major}} {{demographic}} shifts {{occurring in the}} country in terms of the racial-ethnic composition of the population, the FCC has been criticized for ignoring the issue of decreasing racial-ethnic diversity of the media. This includes charges that the FCC has been watering down the limited affirmative action regulations it had on the books, including no longer requiring stations to make public their data on their minority staffing and hiring. In the second half of 2006, groups such as the National Hispanic Media Coalition, the National Latino Media Council, the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, the National Institute for Latino Policy, the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) and others held town hall meetings in California, New York and Texas on media diversity as its effects <b>Latinos</b> <b>and</b> minority communities. They documented widespread and deeply felt community concerns about the negative effects of media concentration and consolidation on racial-ethnic diversity in staffing and programming. At these Latino town hall meetings, the issue of the FCC's lax monitoring of obscene and pornographic material in Spanish-language radio and the lack of racial and national-origin diversity among Latino staff in Spanish-language television were other major themes.|$|E
