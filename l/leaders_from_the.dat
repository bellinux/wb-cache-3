5|$|Halfway {{through the}} year South Katanga was further divided into the provinces of Katanga Oriental and Lualaba (also known as the new South Katanga). Though they were opposed to such divisions, many Katangese <b>leaders</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> secession joined the new provincial governments. A new {{constitutional}} commission was established, and in March 1964 it recommended that the Congo switch from its parliamentary system to a presidential model of government.|$|E

5|$|A 2009 report, {{authored}} by Justice Manmohan Singh Liberhan, found that 68 people {{were responsible for}} the demolition, mostly <b>leaders</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> BJP. Among those named were Vajpayee, Advani, and Murli Manohar Joshi. The report also criticised Kalyan Singh, Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh during the demolition. He was accused of posting bureaucrats and police officers who would stay silent during the demolition. Anju Gupta, an Indian Police Service officer in charge of Advani's security, appeared as a prominent witness before the commission. She said that Advani and Joshi made provocative speeches that were {{a major factor in the}} mob's behaviour.|$|E
5|$|After World War I, {{and with}} another European war looming, <b>leaders</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{historic}} peace churches met to strategize {{about how to}} cooperate with the government to avoid the difficulties of World War I. Holding a common view that any participation in military service was not acceptable, they devised a plan of civilian alternative service, based on experience gained by American Friends Service Committee work in Europe during and after World War I and forestry service done by Russian Mennonites in lieu of military service in Tsarist Russia.|$|E
5|$|In 1805 U.S. Lieutenant Zebulon Pike {{was sent}} by General Wilkinson, {{governor}} of the Louisiana Territory, to enforce U.S. sovereignty against British traders {{in the area and}} establish diplomatic and trading relationships with the native tribes. He met with the Sioux leadership in central Minnesota to secure rights for the U.S. to an area near Saint Anthony Falls, which would later become the city of Saint Paul. Though a treaty was signed by some <b>leaders</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sioux tribes, its legitimacy (including whether the Sioux understood it) was dubious and ultimately his efforts did little to establish the authority of the U.S. in the area.|$|E

5|$|SAS Institute {{started as}} a project at North Carolina State University to create a {{statistical}} analysis system (hence the proper name, Statistical Analysis System) that was originally used primarily by agricultural departments at universities in the late 1960s. It became an independent, private business led by current CEO James Goodnight and three other project <b>leaders</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> university in 1976. SAS grew from $10 million in revenues in 1980 to $1.1 billion by 2000. A larger proportion of these revenues are spent {{on research and development}} than at most other software companies, at one point more than double the industry average.|$|E
5|$|The press, the radio, and the {{television}} also contributed to these discussions by hosting meetings where students and young workers could ask questions of writers such as Goldstucker, Pavel Kohout, and Jan Prochazka and political victims such as Josef Smrkovský, Zdenek Hejzlar, and Gustav Husak. Television also broadcast meetings between former political prisoners and the communist <b>leaders</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> secret police or prisons where they were held. Most importantly, this new {{freedom of the press}} and the introduction of television into the lives of everyday Czechoslovak citizens moved the political dialogue from the intellectual to the popular sphere.|$|E
5|$|Another {{strike in}} Szczecin broke out on 22 January 1971. In a risky move, Gierek went to Szczecin on 24 January and to Gdańsk the next day. He met the workers personally, apologizing for the {{mistakes}} of the past and saying that as a former worker himself he understood their plight and would now govern Poland for the people. Workers striking in Szczecin formulated demands in the area of freely elected worker councils and union representatives. Gierek agreed, but the authorities soon marginalized and eliminated the worker <b>leaders</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> legally existing structures and their places of employment. The February 1971 Łódź strikes followed and concentrated on economic demands. Afterwards prices were lowered, wage increases were announced, and sweeping economic and political changes were promised.|$|E

He held this post for 14 months before returning to the Pentagon as Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans in August 1987. In a second role, Schwarzkopf served as the Army's senior member on the Military Staff Committee at the United Nations Security Council, where he began to build diplomatic skills in dealings with representatives from other countries. As a part of his duties during the posting, he sat in on arms reduction talks with <b>leaders</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Su Dingfang was a {{commander}} from south-central Hebei who, {{earlier in his}} career as an officer, was responsible for leading the attack against the military camp of Illig Qaghan, qaghan of the Eastern Turks. He also gained military experience {{as a leader of}} a regional militia during the civil war fought between the transition from Sui to Tang. Su was a general with military experience in Central Asia, and was familiar with the culture of the steppes. He had been in contact with military <b>leaders</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> region. He was one of nine multi-ethnic commanders invited by Emperor Gaozong to a military event in 655. The Turkic general Ashina Zhong, second cousin of Ashina She'er, was another commander in attendance.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, Marrakesh {{underwent}} {{several years of}} unrest. After the premature death in 1900 of the grand vizier Ba Ahmed, who had been designated regent until the designated sultan Abd al-Aziz became of age, the country was plagued by anarchy, tribal revolts, the plotting of feudal lords, and European intrigues. In 1907, Marrakesh caliph Moulay Abd al-Hafid was proclaimed sultan by the powerful tribes of the High Atlas and by Ulama scholars who denied the legitimacy of his brother, Abd al-Aziz. It was also in 1907 that Dr. Mauchamp, a French doctor, was murdered in Marrakesh, suspected of spying for his country. France used the event as a pretext for sending its troops from the eastern Moroccan town of Oujda to the major metropolitan centre of Casablanca in the west. The French colonial army encountered strong resistance from Ahmed al-Hiba, a son of Sheikh Ma al-'Aynayn, who arrived from the Sahara accompanied by his nomadic Reguibat tribal warriors. On 30 March 1912, the French Protectorate in Morocco was established. After the Battle of Sidi Bou Othman, which saw {{the victory of the}} French Mangin column over the al-Hiba forces in September 1912, the French seized Marrakesh. The conquest was facilitated by the rallying of the Imzwarn tribes and their <b>leaders</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> powerful Glaoui family, leading to a massacre of Marrakesh citizens in the resulting turmoil.|$|E

5|$|Subsequently, the {{legislature}} and local press started questioning {{the actions of the}} Puerto Rico Police, the Puerto Rico Justice Department, the U.S. Justice Department, and the FBI actions during the first investigation, alleging corruption within the agencies and a conspiracy to cover-up evidence. Letters were sent by various community and political leaders to then Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Senator Edward M. Kennedy, asking for an inquiry into the conduct of the Federal investigations. Several letters even accused former US Attorney General Benjamin R. Civiletti of providing aid to Gov. Romero Barceló during the investigations. Two <b>leaders</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> opposing parties, the Popular Democratic Party and the Puerto Rican Independence Party, charged that after a December 1979 meeting between the two, the Governor, then considered as a lifelong Republican, began campaigning to deliver the 41 Democratic Party convention votes of the island for President Jimmy Carter's (D) nomination for the presidency (ironically, Carter’s opponent for the nomination was Senator Kennedy). Almost 45 days after President Carter won the nomination by only one delegate, the U.S. Justice Department announced that due to lack of evidence it was bringing its investigation of the case to an end. A Justice Department internal memorandum that was issued the same month of Romero Barceló’s and Civiletti’s meeting later proved that the investigations were closed even when agents were still investigating important evidence of the case that could potentially incriminate the officers, including “several unexplained contusions” on a victim's face and the fact that one of the police officers recanted his original story, stating that there was in fact “two bursts of firing”.|$|E
5|$|To the {{disappointment}} of the Catholic party, however, Mary tolerated {{the newly established}} Protestant ascendancy, and kept her half-brother Lord Moray as her chief advisor. Her privy council of 16 men, appointed on 6 September 1561, retained those who already held the offices of state and was dominated by the Protestant <b>leaders</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> reformation crisis of 1559–1560: the Earls of Argyll, Glencairn, and Moray. Only four of the councillors were Catholic: the Earls of Atholl, Erroll, Montrose, and Huntly, who was Lord Chancellor. Modern historian Jenny Wormald found this remarkable, suggesting that Mary's failure to appoint a council sympathetic to Catholic and French interests was an indication of her focus on {{the goal of the}} English throne over the internal problems of Scotland. Even the one significant later addition to the council, Lord Ruthven in December 1563, was another Protestant whom Mary personally disliked. In this, she was acknowledging her lack of effective military power {{in the face of the}} Protestant lords, while also following a policy that strengthened her links with England. She joined with Lord Moray in the destruction of Scotland's leading Catholic magnate, Lord Huntly, in 1562 after he led a rebellion in the Highlands against her.|$|E
