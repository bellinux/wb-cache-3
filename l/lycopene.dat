5|$|Pigments {{responsible}} for the orange to red colors of the mature fruit bodies {{have been identified as}} carotenes, predominantly <b>lycopene</b> and beta-carotene—the same compounds {{responsible for}} the red and orange colors of tomatoes and carrots, respectively. <b>Lycopene</b> is also the main pigment in the closely related fungus Clathrus archeri, while beta-carotene is the predominant pigment in the Phallaceae species Mutinus caninus, M.ravenelii, and M.elegans.|$|E
5|$|Optical properties, {{including}} the PL efficiency, {{can be modified}} by encapsulating organic dyes (carotene, <b>lycopene,</b> etc.) inside the tubes. Efficient energy transfer occurs between the encapsulated dye and nanotube — light is efficiently absorbed by the dye and without significant loss is transferred to the SWCNT. Thus potentially, optical properties of a carbon nanotube can be controlled by encapsulating certain molecule inside it. Besides, encapsulation allows isolation and characterization of organic molecules which are unstable under ambient conditions. For example, Raman spectra are extremely difficult to measure from dyes because of their strong PL (efficiency close to 100%). However, encapsulation of dye molecules inside SWCNTs completely quenches dye PL, thus allowing measurement and analysis of their Raman spectra.|$|E
25|$|In addition, some {{foods that}} do not appear red also contain <b>lycopene,</b> e.g., asparagus, which {{contains}} approximately 30μg of <b>lycopene</b> per 100 gram serving (0.3μg/g) and dried parsley and basil, which contain approximately 3.5-7 μg of <b>lycopene</b> per gram.|$|E
25|$|Fruits and {{vegetables}} that {{are high in}} <b>lycopene</b> include autumn olive, gac, tomatoes, watermelon, pink grapefruit, pink guava, papaya, seabuckthorn, wolfberry (goji, a berry relative of tomato), and rosehip. Ketchup is a common dietary source of <b>lycopene.</b> Although gac (Momordica cochinchinensis Spreng) has the highest content of <b>lycopene</b> of any known fruit or vegetable (multiple times more than tomatoes), tomatoes and tomato-based sauces, juices, and ketchup {{account for more than}} 85% of the dietary intake of <b>lycopene</b> for most people. The <b>lycopene</b> content of tomatoes depends on species and increases as the fruit ripens.|$|E
25|$|Cooking and {{crushing}} tomatoes (as in the canning process) {{and serving}} in oil-rich dishes (such as spaghetti sauce or pizza) greatly increases assimilation from {{the digestive tract}} into the bloodstream. <b>Lycopene</b> is fat-soluble, so the oil is said to help absorption. Gac is a possible commercial source of <b>lycopene</b> {{for the purposes of}} extraction and purification, as its seed content of <b>lycopene</b> is high. Another source of <b>lycopene</b> is the fungus Blakeslea trispora.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lycopene</b> may {{increase}} the risk of bleeding when taken with anticoagulant drugs. Because <b>lycopene</b> may cause low blood pressure, interactions with drugs that affect blood pressure may occur. <b>Lycopene</b> may affect the immune system, the nervous system, sensitivity to sunlight, or drugs used for stomach ailments.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other {{fruits and}} vegetables, where {{nutritional}} content such as vitamin C is diminished upon cooking, processing of tomatoes increases {{the concentration of}} bioavailable <b>lycopene.</b> <b>Lycopene</b> in tomato paste is up to four times more bioavailable than in fresh tomatoes. The reason is that in raw plant foods, <b>lycopene</b> is insoluble in water and is tightly bound to vegetable fiber. Processed tomato products such as pasteurized tomato juice, soup, sauce, and ketchup contain a higher concentration of bioavailable <b>lycopene</b> compared to raw tomatoes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lycopene</b> {{from the}} neo-Latin Lycopersicum, the tomato species, {{is a bright}} red {{carotene}} and carotenoid pigment and phytochemical found in tomatoes and other red fruits and vegetables, such as red carrots, watermelons, gac, and papayas, although not in strawberries or cherries. Although <b>lycopene</b> is chemically a carotene, it has no vitamin A activity. Foods that are not red may also contain <b>lycopene,</b> such as asparagus and parsley.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lycopene</b> is {{non-toxic}} and {{commonly found}} in the diet, mainly from tomato products. There are cases of intolerance or allergic reaction to dietary <b>lycopene,</b> which may cause diarrhea, nausea, stomach pain or cramps, gas, and loss of appetite.|$|E
25|$|In plants, algae, {{and other}} {{photosynthetic}} organisms, <b>lycopene</b> {{is an important}} intermediate in the biosynthesis of many carotenoids, including beta-carotene, {{which is responsible for}} yellow, orange, or red pigmentation, photosynthesis, and photoprotection. Like all carotenoids, <b>lycopene</b> is a polyunsaturated hydrocarbon, i.e. an unsubstituted alkene. Structurally, <b>lycopene</b> is a tetraterpene and assembled from eight isoprene units that are composed entirely of carbon and hydrogen. It is insoluble in water. Lycopene's eleven conjugated double bonds give its deep red color and its antioxidant activity in vitro. Owing to the strong color, <b>lycopene</b> is a useful food coloring (registered as E160d) and is approved for usage in the USA, Australia and New Zealand (registered as 160d) and the EU.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lycopene</b> {{is under}} a variety of basic and {{clinical}} research, including primarily its potential effects on cardiovascular diseases and prostate cancer. A 2011 review shows insufficient evidence to support the use of <b>lycopene</b> for the prevention of prostate cancer.|$|E
25|$|In {{a review}} of {{literature}} on <b>lycopene</b> and its potential role as a dietary antioxidant, the European Food Safety Authority {{concluded that there was}} insufficient evidence for <b>lycopene</b> having this effect in humans, particularly as it may affect skin, heart function or vision protection from ultraviolet light.|$|E
25|$|Plants and {{photosynthetic}} bacteria naturally produce all-trans <b>lycopene.</b> When exposed to light or heat, <b>lycopene</b> can undergo isomerization {{to any of}} a number of cis-isomers, which have a bent rather than linear shape. Different isomers were shown to have different stabilities due to their molecular energy (highest stability: 5-cis ≥ all-trans ≥ 9-cis ≥ 13-cis > 15-cis > 7-cis > 11-cis: lowest). In the human bloodstream, various cis-isomers constitute more than 60% of the total <b>lycopene</b> concentration, but the biological effects of individual isomers have not been investigated.|$|E
25|$|Peter Bramley {{discovered}} in the 1990s that a single phytoene desaturase gene (bacterial CrtI) {{can be used to}} produce <b>lycopene</b> from phytoene in GM tomato, rather than having to introduce multiple carotene desaturases that are normally used by higher plants. <b>Lycopene</b> is then cyclized to beta-carotene by the endogenous cyclase in Golden Rice.|$|E
25|$|Carotenoids like <b>lycopene</b> are {{important}} pigments found in photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes in plants, photosynthetic bacteria, fungi, and algae. They {{are responsible for}} the bright orangered colors of fruits and vegetables, perform various functions in photosynthesis, and protect photosynthetic organisms from excessive light damage. <b>Lycopene</b> is a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of many important carotenoids, such as beta-carotene, and xanthophylls.|$|E
25|$|The psy and crtI genes were {{transferred}} into the rice nuclear genome and {{placed under the}} control of an endosperm-specific promoter, so that they are only expressed in the endosperm. The exogenous lcy gene has a transit peptide sequence attached, so it is targeted to the plastid, where geranylgeranyl diphosphate is formed. The bacterial crtI gene was an important inclusion to complete the pathway, since it can catalyze multiple steps in the synthesis of carotenoids up to <b>lycopene,</b> while these steps require more than one enzyme in plants. The end product of the engineered pathway is <b>lycopene,</b> but if the plant accumulated <b>lycopene,</b> the rice would be red. Recent analysis has shown the plant's endogenous enzymes process the <b>lycopene</b> to beta-carotene in the endosperm, giving the rice the distinctive yellow color for which it is named. The original golden rice was called SGR1, and under greenhouse conditions it produced 1.6µg/g of carotenoids.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that there}} are some {{resources}} which make the mistaken assumption that all red fruits contain <b>lycopene,</b> when in fact many are pigmented by other chemicals. An example is the blood orange, which is colored by anthocyanins, while other red colored oranges, such as the Cara cara navel, and other citrus fruit, such as pink grapefruit, are colored by <b>lycopene.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Lycopene</b> is {{the pigment}} in tomato-containing sauces, turning plastic {{cookware}} orange and is insoluble in water. It can be dissolved only in organic solvents and oils. Because of its non-polarity, <b>lycopene</b> in food preparations will stain any sufficiently porous material, including most plastics. To remove this staining, the plastics can be soaked {{in a solution}} containing {{a small amount of}} household bleach.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lycopene</b> is a {{symmetrical}} tetraterpene assembled {{from eight}} isoprene units. It {{is a member}} of the carotenoid family of compounds, and because it consists entirely of carbon and hydrogen, is also a carotene. Isolation procedures for <b>lycopene</b> were first reported in 1910, and the structure of the molecule was determined by 1931. In its natural, all-trans form, the molecule is long and straight, constrained by its system of eleven conjugated double bonds. Each extension in this conjugated system reduces the energy required for electrons to transition to higher energy states, allowing the molecule to absorb visible light of progressively longer wavelengths. <b>Lycopene</b> absorbs all but the longest wavelengths of visible light, so it appears red.|$|E
25|$|While also pigmented, Cara cara navels and Vainiglia Sanguignos have {{pigmentation}} {{based on}} <b>lycopene,</b> not anthocyanins like blood oranges.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lycopene</b> {{is not an}} {{essential}} nutrient for humans, but is commonly found in the diet mainly from dishes prepared from tomatoes.|$|E
25|$|Parsley is {{a source}} of {{flavonoids}} and antioxidants, especially luteolin, apigenin, folic acid, vitamin K, vitamin C, and vitamin A. Half a tablespoon (a gram) of dried parsley contains about 6.0µg of <b>lycopene</b> and 10.7µg of alpha carotene as well as 82.9µg of lutein+zeaxanthin and 80.7µg of beta carotene.|$|E
25|$|Ozone {{application}} on freshly cut pineapple {{and banana}} shows increase in flavonoids and total phenol contents when exposure {{is up to}} 20 minutes. Decrease in ascorbic acid (one form of vitamin C) content is observed but the positive effect on total phenol content and flavonoids can overcome the negative effect. Tomatoes upon treatment with ozone shows an increase in β-carotene, lutein and <b>lycopene.</b> However, ozone application on strawberries in pre-harvest period shows decrease in ascorbic acid content.|$|E
25|$|The {{data on the}} {{relationship}} between diet and prostate cancer is poor. In light of this the rate of prostate cancer is linked to the consumption of the Western diet. There is little if any evidence to support an association between trans fat, saturated fat and carbohydrate intake and risk of prostate cancer. Evidence regarding the role of omega-3 fatty acids in preventing prostate cancer does not suggest that they reduce the risk of prostate cancer, although additional research is needed. Vitamin supplements appear to have no effect and some may increase the risk. High calcium intake has been linked to advanced prostate cancer. Consuming fish may lower prostate cancer deaths but does not appear to affect its occurrence. Some evidence supports lower rates of prostate cancer with a vegetarian diet. There is some tentative evidence for foods containing <b>lycopene</b> and selenium. Diets rich in cruciferous vegetables, soy, beans and other legumes may be associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer, especially more advanced cancers.|$|E
25|$|Saffron {{contains}} more than 150 volatile and aroma-yielding compounds. It also has many nonvolatile active components, {{many of which are}} carotenoids, including zeaxanthin, <b>lycopene,</b> and various α- and β-carotenes. However, saffron's golden yellow-orange colour is primarily the result of α-crocin. This crocin is trans-crocetin di-(β-D-gentiobiosyl) ester; it bears the systematic (IUPAC) name 8,8-diapo-8,8-carotenoic acid. This means that the crocin underlying saffron's aroma is a digentiobiose ester of the carotenoid crocetin. Crocins themselves are a series of hydrophilic carotenoids that are either monoglycosyl or diglycosyl polyene esters of crocetin. Crocetin is a conjugated polyene dicarboxylic acid that is hydrophobic, and thus oil-soluble. When crocetin is esterified with two water-soluble gentiobioses, which are sugars, a product results that is itself water-soluble. The resultant α-crocin is a carotenoid pigment that may comprise more than 10% of dry saffron's mass. The two esterified gentiobioses make α-crocin ideal for colouring water-based and non-fatty foods such as rice dishes.|$|E
500|$|The {{fruit body}} {{initially}} appears like a whitish [...] "egg" [...] {{attached to the}} ground at the base by cords called rhizomorphs. The egg has a delicate, leathery outer membrane enclosing the compressed lattice that surrounds a layer of olive-green spore-bearing slime called the gleba, which contains high levels of calcium that help protect the fruit body during development. As the egg ruptures and the fruit body expands, the gleba is carried upward on the inner surfaces of the spongy lattice, and the egg membrane remains as a volva {{around the base of the}} structure. The fruit body can reach heights of up to [...] The color of the fruit body, which can range from pink to orange to red, results primarily from the carotenoid pigments <b>lycopene</b> and beta-carotene. The gleba has a fetid odor, somewhat like rotting meat, which attracts flies and other insects to help disperse its spores. Although the edibility of the fungus is not known with certainty, its odor would deter most from consuming it. C.ruber was not regarded highly in tales in southern European folklore, which suggested that those who handled the mushroom risked contracting various ailments.|$|E
500|$|The {{nutritional}} {{components of}} R.virescens mushrooms have been characterized. Fresh mushrooms contain about 92.5% moisture. A [...] sample of dried mushroom (100gdw) has 365 kcal (1527 kilojoules). Carbohydrates {{make up the}} bulk of the fruit bodies, comprising 62% of the dry weight; 11.1% of the carbohydrates are sugars, the large majority of which (10.9%) is mannitol. The total lipid, or crude fat, content makes up 1.85% of the dry matter of the mushroom. The proportion of fatty acids (expressed as a percentage of total fatty acids) are 28.78% saturated, 41.51% monounsaturated, and 29.71% polyunsaturated. The most prevalent fatty acids include: palmitic acid, 17.3% of total fatty acids; stearic acid, 7.16%; oleic acid, 40.27%; and linoleic acid, 29.18%. Several bioactive compounds are present in the mushroom. One hundred grams (dry weight) contains 49.3 micrograms (µg) of tocopherols (20.0µg alpha, 21.3µg beta, and 8.0µg gamma) and 0.19 milligrams (mg) of the carotenoid pigment <b>lycopene.</b> There are 4.46g of organic acids per 100g of dry mushrooms, including oxalic acid (0.78g), malic acid (2.71g), citric acid (0.55g), and fumaric acid (0.23g). Mushrooms have 22.6mg/100gdw of the phenolic compound 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, and 15.8mg/100gdw of cinnamic acid.|$|E
2500|$|Absorption of <b>lycopene</b> {{requires}} {{that it be}} combined with bile salts and fat to form micelles. Intestinal absorption [...] of <b>lycopene</b> is enhanced {{by the presence of}} fat and by cooking. <b>Lycopene</b> dietary supplements (in oil) may be more efficiently absorbed than <b>lycopene</b> from food.|$|E
2500|$|.....no studies {{provided}} information about whether <b>lycopene</b> intake {{may reduce the}} risk of any of the specific forms of cancer. Based on the above, FDA concludes that there is no credible evidence supporting a relationship between <b>lycopene</b> consumption, either as a food ingredient, a component of food, or as a dietary supplement, and any of these cancers." ...|$|E
2500|$|The unconditioned {{biosynthesis}} of <b>lycopene</b> in eukaryotic {{plants and}} in prokaryotic cyanobacteria is similar, {{as are the}} enzymes involved. Synthesis begins with mevalonic acid, which is converted into dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. [...] This is then condensed with three molecules of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (an isomer of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate), to give the twenty-carbon geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. [...] Two molecules of this product are then condensed in a tail-to-tail configuration to give the forty-carbon phytoene, the first committed step in carotenoid biosynthesis. [...] Through several desaturation steps, phytoene is converted into <b>lycopene.</b> [...] The two terminal isoprene groups of <b>lycopene</b> can be cyclized to produce beta-carotene, which can then {{be transformed into a}} wide variety of xanthophylls.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Lycopene</b> from {{tomatoes}} {{has been}} tested in human studies in the United States and other countries for cardiovascular diseases and prostate cancer. These studies, however, did not attain sufficient scientific agreement to conclude an effect on any disease. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in rejecting manufacturers' requests in 2005 to allow [...] "qualified labeling" [...] for <b>lycopene</b> and the reduction of various cancer risks, provided a conclusion remaining in effect in 2017: ...|$|E
2500|$|... (The {{insertion}} of a lcy (<b>lycopene</b> cyclase) gene {{was thought to}} be needed, but further research showed it is already produced in wild-type rice endosperm.) ...|$|E
2500|$|... ζ-Carotene is the biosynthetic {{precursor}} of neurosporene, {{which is the}} {{precursor of}} <b>lycopene,</b> which, in turn, is the precursor of the carotenes α through ε.|$|E
2500|$|Concerns {{have been}} raised that the {{nutrients}} in Juice Plus+ capsules may not be bioavailable or effectively absorbed by the human body, {{and that some of}} the nutrients claimed to be in the products may not be present in significant amounts. Studies on nutrient absorption showed that subjects taking Juice Plus had elevated blood levels of folate and β-carotene, but the effects on blood levels of vitamin E and vitamin C were inconsistent. Some studies have shown significant increases in vitamin E and C levels, while other studies have shown much weaker effects on vitamin E and C levels, and that the levels of vitamin E and vitamin C are not significantly increased. Juice Plus was found to increase blood <b>lycopene</b> levels in several studies, while other studies have indicated that Juice Plus does not raise blood levels of <b>lycopene</b> or other phytochemicals in fresh fruits and vegetables such as lutein, zeaxanthin, [...] and β-cryptoxanthin.|$|E
2500|$|... β-Carotene and <b>lycopene</b> {{molecules}} can be encapsulated into carbon nanotubes {{enhancing the}} optical properties of carbon nanotubes. Efficient energy transfer occurs between the encapsulated dye and nanotube — light is {{absorbed by the}} dye and without significant loss is transferred to the single wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT). Encapsulation increases chemical and thermal stability of carotene molecules; it also allows their isolation and individual characterization.|$|E
2500|$|Carotenoids are red, orange, {{or yellow}} tetraterpenoids. [...] They {{function}} as accessory pigments in plants, helping to fuel photosynthesis by gathering wavelengths of light not readily absorbed by chlorophyll. [...] The most familiar carotenoids are carotene (an orange pigment found in carrots), lutein (a yellow pigment found in fruits and vegetables), and <b>lycopene</b> (the red pigment {{responsible for the}} color of tomatoes). [...] Carotenoids {{have been shown to}} act as antioxidants and to promote healthy eyesight in humans.|$|E
