30|$|The {{aircraft}} {{ready to}} <b>load</b> <b>date</b> is the earliest date upon which an aircraft can be loaded and depart the APOE. After selecting a pallet cargo load, DALP-TS computes an appropriate aircraft departure {{date from the}} APOE that considers pallet available to <b>load</b> <b>date.</b> The aircraft arrival date describes the date upon which the aircraft arrives at the APOD, incorporating the departure date and the required travel time from APOE to APOD. The aircraft departure date can {{be the same as}} the ready to load date; however, delaying the departure date to a later date may prevent or reduce the amount of pallet temporal violations. The ready to <b>load</b> <b>date</b> for each aircraft’s first trip is day 1. The ready to <b>load</b> <b>date</b> of each subsequent trip for a particular aircraft considers the previous trip’s departure date and the travel, down, and return time.|$|R
30|$|Numerous {{changes to}} an {{aircraft}} trip’s temporal information {{results from the}} unload entire aircraft and inter-aircraft pallet swap neighborhoods. First, an aircraft trip departure date might require modification to minimize pallet temporal violations. If the current departure date of a trip is later than the ready to <b>load</b> <b>date,</b> DALP-TS can decrease the departure date; however, the algorithm does not schedule an aircraft trip’s departure date prior to its ready to <b>load</b> <b>date.</b> Decreasing a departure date only occurs if doing so improves the solution. Changing the departure date to a date which causes infeasibilities {{in the majority of}} the loaded pallets is unproductive. Decreasing the departure date of an aircraft trip creates a series of ready to <b>load</b> <b>date</b> decreases in subsequent aircraft trips; DALP-TS modifies the departure date of the succeeding aircraft trips if doing so improves the overall objective function value. Note that the trip ready to <b>load</b> <b>date</b> is the earliest date upon which an aircraft may depart; this date does not necessarily correspond to the best departure date for a given pallet load. By increasing a trip’s departure date, DALP-TS could trigger a series of updates to the subsequent aircraft trips. This occurs when a trip’s altered departure date causes the ready to <b>load</b> <b>date</b> of the succeeding trip to be after its departure date; DALP-TS then equates the departure date with the ready to <b>load</b> <b>date.</b>|$|R

30|$|To {{generate}} an initial solution, DALP-TS sequentially sorts the pallets by increasing available <b>load</b> <b>date,</b> earliest arrival date, latest arrival date, and required delivery date, {{and then by}} decreasing weight, at this point, all pallets are theoretically “loaded” in the “storage aircraft.” The DALP-TS initial solution generator selects the pallet {{at the head of}} the sorted pallet list. Next, the best suitable aircraft is selected. Three states of feasible (i.e., no temporal or ACL violations) aircraft trip availability exist for every pallet: (1) At least one non-empty aircraft (i.e., with one or more pallets loaded) is scheduled to be at the APOE with feasible temporal constraints and sufficient weight and space capacity remaining to support the pallet. In this case, DALP-TS selects the aircraft with the largest ratio of ACL to number of pallet positions and the smallest weight capacity remaining. (2) An available aircraft has returned from a trip and has a ready to <b>load</b> <b>date</b> which enables the pallet to arrive on or before its latest arrival date. In state 2, DALP-TS the aircraft with the largest ratio of ACL to number of pallet positions and the largest trip index. (3) No additional aircraft trips satisfy the pallet’s temporal window requirements. For state 3, DALP-TS utilizes the next unused aircraft from the user-provided list of available aircraft.|$|R

30|$|Airlift {{provides}} {{military forces}} the global reach capability to quickly apply strategic power to various crisis situations worldwide [1]. Airlift {{has a history}} spanning over 80  years [6, 14]. While numerous advances have been achieved in both aircraft capabilities and airlift procedures, many areas for improvement still exist. As noted in [34], an area of airlift not yet adequately addressed involves (1) packing cargo items onto pallets, (2) partitioning the pallets into aircraft loads, (3) selecting an efficient and effective subset of aircraft from an available pool of aircraft, and (4) feasibly placing the pallets in the best allowable positions. These four tasks are interdependent and their combination, augmented with temporal considerations (e.g., earliest cargo available <b>load</b> <b>date</b> at its aerial port of embarkation (APOE) and earliest and latest delivery dates to its designated aerial port of debarkation (APOD)), defines the dynamic airlift loading problem (DALP).|$|R

30|$|After {{selecting}} the aircraft, DALP-TS removes the pallet from the “storage aircraft” and assigns {{it to the}} first available position in the aircraft. If the aircraft’s trip is in state 1, no changes to the aircraft departure date or solution object are necessary; however, updates are required for states 2 or 3. First, DALP-TS increments the number of flights flown in the solution object. DALP-TS also updates the aircraft’s departure date and arrival date to reflect the new temporal constraints. DALP-TS sets the aircraft arrival date identical to the pallet latest arrival date and adjusts the aircraft’s departure date to incorporate travel time; this also causes the insertion of an additional aircraft trip in the solution object. The ready to <b>load</b> <b>date</b> of this trip incorporates the previous trip’s departure date and total travel time. For this trip, the aircraft is empty but available for future loading. If the initial solution generator is in state 3, the aircraft is being used for the first time; the aircraft departure date is updated such that the aircraft arrival date corresponds with the pallet’s earliest arrival date.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{antiretroviral}} therapy on both T-cell numbers and T-cell function in peripheral blood was studied. CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-cell numbers, T-cell reactivity to CD 3 monoclonal antibodies (mAb), and viral RNA <b>load</b> <b>date</b> {{were obtained from}} patients treated for at least 28 weeks with either the HIV- 1 protease inhibitor ritonavir, the nonnucleoside HIV- 1 reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor nevirapine, or the nucleoside-analogue RT inhibitor zidovudine. Compared with both RT inhibitors, treatment with the protease inhibitor ritonavir resulted in the most significant and persistent elevation of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-cell counts. However, in vitro T-cell functional improvement was of limited duration in the ritonavir-treated group and was inversely correlated with viral RNA load changes during the entire follow-up period. Thus, despite what can be assumed of responses during RT inhibitor therapy, quantitative responses on therapy did not necessarily correlate with qualitative immunologic responses, {{as can be seen}} during treatment with ritonavir. For optimal immune reconstitution, both numeric and functional immunologic improvements are essential.

30|$|The pallet input object {{presented}} in Table  1 contains three physical and four temporal data fields. The pallet object physical data fields detail an identification {{number and the}} height and weight of the loaded pallet which indicate whether a pallet feasibly fits into an aircraft’s pallet position. Utilization of the military standard 463 L pallet system removes the necessity of including length and width dimensions for a loaded pallet, which are 108 ″ ×  88 ″. The pallet’s available <b>load</b> <b>date</b> corresponds to the earliest <b>date</b> available for <b>loading</b> on an aircraft; as such, it is strictly enforced by DALP-TS. Violations of the remaining three temporal fields are allowed but penalized. Pallets reaching the APOD prior to the earliest arrival date may arrive before the necessary equipment and/or personnel required for cargo unloading are in place and may also cause port congestion issues (i.e., exceeding airfield storage capacity) at the APOD. The pallet latest arrival date and pallet required delivery date are very similar and often identical. The latest arrival date is the latest date by which the pallet should arrive at the APOD to enable proper unloading and assembly; the required delivery date is the latest date by which the pallet must arrive at the APOD prior to the deploying force departing the APOD.|$|R
40|$|The {{agricultural}} wastes {{proposed for the}} removal of water pollutants in this study are seeds of two Saudi date lines which are quite abundant in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, having high ion exchange capacity for organic compounds.

30|$|A loaded aircraft’s CB is the {{distance}} (measured in inches) {{of the cargo}} load CB from an associated reference line. For an aircraft’s longitudinal CB, the reference line is {{at or near the}} front of the aircraft (varies for each aircraft type); for aircraft with two pallet rows, the reference line for the lateral CB follows the center of the aircraft from nose to tail. An aircraft’s CB is computed as the sum of the pallets’ moments divided by the total weight of the cargo, where a pallet’s moment is the product of the pallet weight and {{the distance}} from the associated reference line. For a given cargo load’s total weight, each aircraft type stipulates a lower and upper bound CB which enables safe flight; additionally, each aircraft type specifies an optimal or target CB location for the best fuel consumption rate at a given cargo load’s total weight. The ready to <b>load</b> <b>date</b> specifies the earliest date the aircraft is available for use. The required travel time indicates the amount of time required for the aircraft to travel from the APOE to APOD. The crew rest time specifies the amount of time required for the crew to rest at the APOD prior to returning to the APOE. Since the DALP’s initial focus is to be effective first and efficient second, the aircraft set is sufficiently large to transport all pallets (i.e., available aircraft is not a limitation in solving the DALP). Senior decision makers may modify the set of aircraft to coincide with their preferences.|$|R

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 187 - 193. The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the effects of load modeling on transient stability studies and to analyze the phenomenon of voltage collapse. In addition, the different generator models are compared {{and the effects of}} voltage dips on induction motor performance are investigated. The modeling of <b>loads</b> <b>dates</b> back to the late forties when network analyzers were still in use. The prohibitive computational requirements resulted in many approximations being made to the load models. In turn, this resulted in the use of simple models which did not provide sufficient information about the dynamic behavior of loads. With the advent of digital computers, more accurate load models could be used in dynamic simulations. Despite this improvement in computational tools, the problem of load modeling for stability studies is still very complex. The load composition changes with the time of the day, the consumer's lifestyle, weather, state of the economy and other factors. The accurate load model would include amongst other things, the effects of the abovementioned factors. Since these factors are unpredictable, accurate load modeling becomes very complex indeed. It is mainly for these reasons that the approximate are still widely in use. Ideally, the response of these approximate models should be compared to the actual loads under similar disturbances. A further concern of the thesis is the study of voltage stability. The voltage stability problem has become a matter of growing concern amongst bulk transmission utilities worldwide over the last decade. For long, the stability of a power system was related exclusively to the synchronous stability of the generators...|$|R
