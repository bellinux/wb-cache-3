40|$|International audienceA {{physically}} based {{model for}} bake-hardening (BH) steels is developed suitable {{to predict the}} BH {{as well as the}} macroscopic behavior of strain-aged steels in tensile tests, such as the <b>lower</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> and the yield point elongation or Lüders strain. A description of the strain aging kinetics is given by considering two aging steps: Cottrell atmospheres formation and precipitation of coherent carbides. The modeling includes the effect of solute carbon content, aging time, temperature, and prestrain. Then, a numerical approach of Lüders phenomenon using finite element (FE) method codes is conducted. The strain aging model is eventually coupled with the previous numerical study thanks to a local mechanical behavior that schematically describes the local dislocation behavior. Simulations of tensile tests are performed and agree well with experiments carried out on aluminum-killed (AlK) and ULC BH steels, in terms of <b>lower</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> and yield point elongation. Effects of aging treatment, grain size, and strain rate on the macroscopic behavior are particularly enlightened...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{describes}} dynamic tensile tests {{carried out}} on a medium carbon steel to determine the true shape of the stress-permanent strain curve for rapid straining. The variation of this curve with change in strain rate, and the progressive deformation of the steel are also studied. An impact testing machine was used, straining being carried out {{as a series of}} dynamic loadings, and the stress was measured by means of electrical resistance strain gauges attached directly to the specimens. Comparison is effected between dynamic and static stress-strain curves, the existence of a “dynamic upper yield stress ” and a “dynamic <b>lower</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> ” being shown, together with a difference in the rate of strain hardening for the two straining conditions. Non-uniform yielding of the metal is shown to be more pronounced for dynamic straining and, like static yielding, to {{be an integral part of}} the <b>lower</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> phenomenon. The manner in which all these factors are aEected by normalizing the steel is shown. A special form of deformation of the steel peculiar to rapid straining is indicated.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{anhydrous}} lactose {{particle size distribution}} on its performance in the wet granulation process was evaluated. Three grades of anhydrous lactose {{were used in the}} study: “as is” manufacturer grade and 2 particle size fractions obtained by screening of the 60 M lactose. Particle growth behavior of the 3 lactose grades was evaluated in a high shear mixer. Compactibility and porosity of the resulting granules were also evaluated. A uniaxial compression test on moist agglomerates of the 3 lactose grades was performed in an attempt to explain the mechanism of particle size effect observed in the high shear mixer. Particle growth of anhydrous lactose in the high shear mixer was inversely related to the particle size of the starting material. In addition, granulation manufactured using the grade with the smallest particle size was more porous and demonstrated enhanced compactibility compared with the other grades. Compacts with similar porosity and low liquid saturation demonstrated brittle behavior and their breakage strength was inversely related to lactose particle size in the uniaxial compression test, suggesting that material with smaller particle size may exhibit more pronounced nucleation behavior during wet granulation. On the other hand, compacts prepared at higher liquid saturation and similar compression force exhibited more plastic behavior and showed <b>lower</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> for the grade with smallest particle size. The <b>lower</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> of compacts prepared with this grade may indicate a higher coalescence tendency for its granules during wet granulation...|$|E

Exposure at 30 and 1200 °C/min to 400 °C resulted in yield strengths of 90  MPa and 170  MPa, respectively.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of an experimental investigation of the initiation of brittle fracture and the nature of discontinuous yielding in small plastic enclaves in an annealed mild steel. Upper and <b>lower</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> data have been obtained from unnotched specimens and nominal fracture stress data have been obtained from specimens of two scale factors and two grain sizes over a range of nominal stress rates from 10 ^ 2 to 10 ^ 7 lb/in. ^ 2 sec at - 111 °F and - 200 °F. The size and shape of plastic enclaves near the notches were revealed by an etch technique. A stress analysis utilizing slip-line field theory in the plastic region has been developed for the notched specimen geometry employed in this investigation. The yield stress of the material in the plastic enclaves near the notch root has been correlated with the <b>lower</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> measured on unnotched specimens through a consideration of the plastic boundary velocity under dynamic loading. A maximum tensile stress of about 122, 000 lb/in. ^ 2 at the instant of fracture initiation was calculated with the aid of the stress analysis for the large scale specimens of ASTM grain size 8 1 / 4. The plastic strain state adjacent to a plastic-elastic interface has been shown to cause the maximum shear stress to have a larger value on the elastic than the plastic side of the interface. This characteristic of dis continuous yielding is instrumental in causing the plastic boundaries to be nearly parallel to the slip-line field where the plastic strain is of the order of the Lüder's strain. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} shear on {{dewatering}} behaviour and particle interactions of Na-exchanged smectite and kaolinite clay dispersions {{has been investigated}} at pH 7. 5, using hydrolysable Ca(II) and Mn(II) ions as coagulants and high molecular weight anionic and non-ionic polyacrylamide (PAM A and PAM N, respectively) and polyethylene oxide (PEO) flocculants. Metal ion addition enhanced the flocculation performance by dramatically reducing {{the magnitude of the}} particle zeta potential and, in the case of smectite pulp, suppressing osmotic swelling. Under optimum orthokinetic flocculation conditions of controlled agitation rate and duration, PAM A and PEO-based flocs settled faster than those of PAM N whilst kaolinite pulps produced higher sedimentation rates than smectite pulps. The settling rates are nearly an order of magnitude greater than those observed under standard flocculant–pulp mixing/flocculation methods of inversion and plunging. The difference in the flocculant behaviour is attributed to the more expanded conformation of PAM A and PEO polymer chains in contrast to PAM N, whilst the <b>lower</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stresses,</b> reflecting inter-particle bridging and floc network structure strength that are conducive to faster clarification, were displayed by kaolinite pulps. Following shear, similar consolidation enhancement of ≈ 5 – 7 wt. % solid for both pulps was achieved at an optimum agitation range of 100 – 200 rpm. This was accompanied by decreased <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> in the case of PAM A-based pulps, indicating non-reversible disruption of polymer mediated particle and floc network structure. In contrast, the <b>yield</b> <b>stresses</b> of PAM N and PEO flocculated dispersions indicated similar and stronger particle interactions, respectively, upon consolidation following shear.

The lignite-free bentonite suspensions thickened considerably when heated at 177 degrees C for 16 h, as was indicated by a two-fold {{increase of the}} <b>yield</b> <b>stress,</b> when compared to samples hydrated only at room temperature.

Addition of lignite maintained {{the stability of the}} suspensions exposed to high temperatures (177 degrees C) by keeping the <b>yield</b> <b>stress</b> low and did not affect plastic viscosity. Some of the Greek lignites performed equally well with a commercial lignite product and improvements of 80 to 100 % of the stability of the suspensions, compared to lignite-free suspensions, have been found. Lignite addition also <b>lowered</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stresses</b> for the hydrated samples. No specific trends have been identified between the {{effectiveness of}} lignites to stabilize bentonite suspensions and their humic and fulvic acids and humins content. However, those lignites with highest humic and fulvic acid contents have maximum stabilization capacity. Similarly, no specific trends have been observed between the stabilization capacity of lignites and their inorganic components such as oxygen and ash content and also with the cation exchange capacity. The effectiveness of the Greek lignites to stabilize bentonite suspensions is very high and the minor differences in the efficiency of the different lignites cannot be attributed solely to any specific component.

Based on {{a general}} model for {{cleavage}} fracture including three criteria: εp≥εpc for initiating a crack nucleus; σm / σe≥Tc for preventing the nucleated crack tip from blunting; σyy≥σf for propagating the crack, the author proposes the critical events controlling cleavage at various temperatures. At {{a very low}} temperature (- 196 o C), critical event is the nucleation of a crack in ferrite at the precrack tip or at a second phase particle. At a moderate low temperature (around- 100 o C), the critical event moves to the propagation of a crack initiating at a carbide into the ferrite grain. With increasing temperature (- 80 o C~- 30 o C), the carbide crack eligible to initiate cleavage {{should be the one}} nucleated by a higher critical strain to gain increments in the flow stress and the effective shear stress by work hardening for making up the effect of <b>lowering</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stress.</b> At a higher temperature (- 30 o C) after the crack tip is blunted to more than 60 µm and a fibrous crack extends, the critical event for cleavage fracture is the propagation of a grain-sized crack.

Homogenized nonlinear finite element (FE) analysis of whole bones can deliver improved fracture risk and implant loosening assessment. Such simulations require the knowledge of mechanical properties such as an appropriate yield behavior and criterion for trabecular bone. Identification of a complete yield surface is extremely difficult experimentally but can be achieved in silico by using micro-FE analysis on cubical trabecular volume elements. Nevertheless, {{the influence of the}} boundary conditions (BCs), which are applied to such volume elements, on the obtained yield properties remains unknown. Therefore, this study compared homogenized yield properties along 17 load cases of 126 human femoral trabecular cubic specimens computed with classical kinematic uniform BCs (KUBCs) and a new set of mixed uniform BCs, namely periodicity-compatible mixed uniform BCs (PMUBCs). In stress space, PMUBCs lead to 7 – 72 % <b>lower</b> <b>yield</b> <b>stresses</b> compared to KUBCs.

A volume fraction and fabric-based quadric yield function successfully fitted the yield surfaces of both BCs with a correlation coefficient R 2 ≥ 0. 93. As expected, yield strains show only a weak dependency on bone volume fraction and fabric.
