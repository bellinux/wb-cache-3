The existence {{and the intensity of}} the Peierls distortion is mainly related to the hardness of the repulsive potential as demonstrated both by theoretical calculations and by the experimental systematic analysis of liquid structures. In particular, As is threefold coordinated and Sb is sixfold coordinated in the liquid; the qualitative difference is explained by the ratio of the distortion energy DeltaE to the thermal energy k BT. The As xSb 1 -x alloys show continuously varying average coordination numbers showing that the semiconductor-metal transition is continuous with concentration.

Grant then confesses he loves her and proposes to her. Julia happily says yes. Julia and Grant go to a wedding planner named Jell-O (Valery Ortiz), who has a big butt. She suggests that they go to a restaurant called Taco Butt (in alternate versions of the movie, she uses her butt as a pencil sharpener and recommends that they use a garbage barge as their wedding location). When they decline, she gets annoyed. When Grant says he has a best man, she shows them what she booked for the entertainment, after which she uses her butt to knock over her desk then rips off her clothes to reveal a gold <b>liquid</b> spandex <b>tight</b> suit. She shows off her dance moves, then twerks and bounce and backs up to the couple with her massive rear for them to scream while she bounces and crushing and suffocate them for them to scream more for the screen to cut to the next scene. The alternate scene is she has backup dancers and she bounces and shows off her dance moves until she shakes her massive booty right to them for them to scream and knocks them over with her right and left buttcheek to end it. Andy helps Julia shop for her wedding dress. At the dress store, Julia hits her head on a power box and finds that she can read people's thoughts. Julia finds from reading Andy's mind that she wants to get back together with Grant and plans to split the two of them up. Julia and Andy fight each other, Kill Bill-style.

40|$|The airway {{epithelium}} is {{the first}} point of contact in the lung for inhaled material, including infectious pathogens and particulate matter, and protects against toxicity from these substances by trapping and clearance via the mucociliary escalator, presence of a protective barrier with tight junctions and initiation of a local inflammatory response. The inflammatory response involves recruitment of phagocytic cells to neutralise and remove and invading materials and is oftern modelled using rodents. However, development of valid in vitro airway epithelial models is of great importance due to the restrictions on animal studies for cosmetic compound testing implicit in the 7 th amendment to the European Union Cosmetics Directive. Further, rodent innate immune responses have fundamental differences to human. Pulmonary endothelial cells and leukocytes are also involved in the innate response initiated during pulmonary inflammation. Co-culture models of the airways, in particular where epithelial cells are cultured at air liquid interface {{with the presence of}} tight junctions and differentiated mucociliary cells, offer a solution to this problem. Ideally validated models will allow for detection of early biomarkers of response to exposure and investigation into inflammatory response during exposure. This thesis describes the approaches taken towards developing an in vitro epithelial/endothelial cell model of the human airways and identification biomarkers of response to exposure to xenobiotics. The model comprised normal human primary microvascular endothelial cells and the bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS- 2 B or normal human bronchial epithelial cells. BEAS- 2 B were chosen as their characterisation at air liquid interface is limited but they are robust in culture, thereby predicted to provide a more reliable test system. Proteomics analysis was undertaken on challenged cells to investigate biomarkers of exposure. BEAS- 2 B morphology was characterised at air liquid interface compared with normal human bronchial epithelial cells. The results indicate that BEAS- 2 B cells at an air <b>liquid</b> interface form <b>tight</b> junctions as shown by expression of the tight junction protein zonula occludens- 1. To this author’s knowledge this {{is the first}} time this result has been reported. The inflammatory response of BEAS- 2 B (measured as secretion of the inflammatory mediators interleukin- 8 and - 6) air liquid interface mono-cultures to Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide or particulate matter (fine and ultrafine titanium dioxide) was comparable to published data for epithelial cells. Cells were also exposed to polymers of “commercial interest” which were in the nanoparticle range (and referred to particles hereafter). BEAS- 2 B mono-cultures showed an increased secretion of inflammatory mediators after challenge. Inclusion of microvascular endothelial cells resulted in protection against LPS- and particle- induced epithelial toxicity, measured as cell viability and inflammatory response, indicating the importance of co-cultures for investigations into toxicity. Two-dimensional proteomic analysis of lysates from particle-challenged cells failed to identify biomarkers of toxicity due to assay interference and experimental variability. Separately, decreased plasma concentrations of serine protease inhibitors, and the negative acute phase proteins transthyretin, histidine-rich glycoprotein and alpha 2 -HS glycoprotein were identified as potential biomarkers of methyl methacrylate/ethyl methacrylate/butylacrylate treatment in rats.

40|$|This {{work has}} been {{performed}} primarily utilizing field measurement holdup and pressure data provided by Saudi Aramco Oil Company. The holdup data was obtained using gamma measurement technique and simulated using two slug prediction models; slug capturing in LedaFlow and slug tracking in OLGA. The work presents {{a unique set of}} large diameter, high pressure data which can be utilized to develop and/or improve multiphase flow simulation tools for industrial oil and gas applications. The data were presented to the OLGA Verification and Improvement Project (OVIP) as part of Saudi Aramco contribution to the improvement program. Recent OVIP reports which were published by OLGA development team in the 3 rd and 4 th quarters of 2014 confirmed the author conclusion which indicates a significant over-prediction of the pipelines pressure drop when slug tracking is enabled in most of the cases. The OLGA development team explored this issue and reported a critical flaw in the slug tracking module which is currently being tackled by the team in order to resolve it in a timely manner. A temporary solution was implemented which improved the results as per the published reports, however a more thorough analysis is required before any final solution is implemented. The discovery of this major flaw in OLGA slug capturing module proves the importance of field measurement data in developing accurate multiphase flow simulation models. LedaFlow on the other hand required the use of a fine mesh in order to obtain good results using the slug capturing module. In most of the cases, a fine mesh which was constructed using (10 * Diameter) was found to provide reasonable results. A finer mesh could have been used but that would require a significant increase in computational time, especially for long pipeline cases which sometimes exceeded (50) Km. In addition to the simulation work, a detailed statistical analysis was carried out to extract the most important information from the holdup data. This mostly included information about the slugs lengths, tail and front velocities, amplitude and frequency. The data was obtained using a Matlab code which was customized specifically for each case. The analyzed data consists of two main parts: •The first part, Field-A, was obtained by Mikal Espedal in 1999 as part of a field measurement project. The work was focused on extremely high hilly terrain multiphase flow pipelines which were 16 inch and 20 inch in diameter. These pipelines were operated in a very high pressure mode, 30 to 60 bar. The high hilly terrain, 100 meter high hills, implies that the dominant slugging mechanism is terrainslugging and as such accurate predictions of pressure drop and pressure cycles were expected from the simulation tools. However, the combination of terrain slugging with choked valves introduced a new phenomenon which provided an interesting and challenging simulation problem. The simulation work indicates a negative impact of the choke on most of the slugging cases. This is counter-intuitive and has not been addressed by any researcher in large diameter oil and gas pipelines prior to this work. Most of the earlier work on choke-slug interactions indicates a positive impact on slug reduction/elimination in offshore pipeline-riser systems. However, the present work indicates that with terrain-induced slugs, the slugging behavior is amplified and a careful investigation of the pipeline system is required before any installation of choked valves. The new phenomenon was further confirmed by the experimental work carried out at NTNU multiphase flow lab. The lab experiments indicate that the additional force created by the choked valves does not help to overcome the compressibility force that exists in the pipeline system. As a result, slugs are still created in the pipeline system and they are amplified by the accumulation of <b>liquid</b> at the <b>tight</b> valve opening. This liquid accumulation compresses the gas upstream and causes a further pressurizing of the system, which eventually leads to larger pressure fluctuations. In addition, OLGA simulation results indicated that, with exception of one pipeline, G 2 NT 1, the nonslug tracking option provided the best results as expected in the cases were large terrain-induced slugs dominate the multiphase flow behavior. Utilizing the slug tracking option in OLGA did not improve the results and in some cases caused larger deviations from the field measurements. Slug tracking also was not able to correctly predict any of the small hydrodynamic slugs measured during holdup measurements. On the other hand, LedaFlow simulation results provided similar results to OLGA as expected. Both multiphase flow codes utilize the same unit cell model to predict large terrain-induced slugs with possibly minor differences in the correlations used in each code. The non-slug capturing cases provided the best results with LedaFlow and the use of slug capturing module did not significantly improve the results as these pipelines where mostly exhibiting large terrain slugging. Slug capturing with relatively fine grid, (5) meters sections, was evaluated to simulate the small hydrodynamic slugs observed between the large slugs. However, LedaFlow could not correctly predict these hydrodynamics slugs using the utilized fine mesh. In general OLGA and LedaFlow produced large deviations in average pressure drops which ranged between 15 % and 25 %, especially in the longer pipelines, G 3 ST 1 pipeline (18) Km and G 3 ST 2 pipeline (20) Km. On the other hand, the frequency and amplitude of slugs were better predicted by both multiphase flow transient codes. The deviations cannot be solely attributed to the multiphase flow simulation codes as uncertainties with field measurements exist and particularly the ones related to fluid flow rates, which were estimated based on historical well production data. •The second part, field measurement of Field-B, C, D and E, was obtained by the author and members of the flow assurance team at Saudi Aramco in 2012, {{with the help of a}} gamma-licensed contractor, Tracerco Ltd., who carried out the physical gamma measurement based on the project requirements set by Saudi Aramco. The work covered variety of onshore and offshore pipelines with very large diameters that ranges from 24 inch to 42 inch. The analysis of the data was performed by the author and are presented in the present work. Although slugging was not experienced in most of these pipelines, a different set of challenges were encountered in each one of them as explained separately in each chapter. The hydrodynamic-slugs initiated differently by the simulation codes OLGA and LedaFlow, seem to have a significant impact on the pressure drop results obtained in each case and as such should be used with caution when simulating multiphase flow pipelines. OLGA simulation indicated an overall good agreement with pressure and holdup field measurements when slug tracking option was disabled. A significant over-prediction in pressure drop was observed in OLGA predictions when slug tracking option was enabled, as was also noticed by OLGA development team in their latest reports. However, there was an exception for this overall good agreement which was observed at Field-E TL- 12. At TL- 12 pipeline, the oil wells where connected to the trunkline over a long distance along the pipeline, which created a situation where the flow rates were considerably low at the start of the pipeline. The superficial gas and liquid velocities ranges from 0. 15 m/sec and 0. 14 m/sec at the beginning of the pipeline to 10 m/sec and 0. 75 m/sec at the end of the pipeline, respectively. The OLGA pressure under-prediction in the non-slug tracking case was approximately (75) psi, which is equivalent to 20 % error. LedaFlow on the other hand showed a similar behavior to OLGA predictions without slug capturing. When slug capturing is enabled, then a fine grid is required to obtain accurate predictions. The slug capturing generally provided better results in terms of pressure drop and holdup if a fine grid is utilized. The one exception where LedaFlow did not perform very well was the same Field-E TL- 12 remote header case where OLGA also did not perform very well. In that particular case, both options in LedaFlow, the slug capturing and non-slug capturing cases proved equally poor with pressure underpredictions of approximately (60) psi which is equivalent to approximately 16 % error. The large pressure discrepancy noted for Field-E TL- 12 pipeline case could partially be attributed to the uncertainties with pipeline profile which is closely related to the static head pressure component known to be the dominant phenomena in low multiphase flow rates cases. However, a large pressure discrepancy was also noted about two years ago in a 36 inch pipeline which was operating in the same area. OLGA simulation at that time was carried out using an approximated pipeline profile and resulted in a pressure under-prediction of more than 100 %. When using a more accurate pipeline profile, the pressure predictions where greatly improved but still showed significant under-prediction in pressure of approximately 35 %. Therefore, there seems to be a general tendency for multiphase simulation packages to under-predict pressure drop in very low flow rates pipelines such as TL- 12. Finally, the work included a thorough analysis of the gamma measurement technique. It showed how a careful and deep understanding of the methodology is required in order to obtain accurate holdup results especially in a field measurement environment were uncertainties are normally higher than the controlled experimental laboratory environment. In particular, there was a focus on the gamma calibration techniques and the unavailability of calibration pipeline spools with the same wall thickness during the field measurements. This issue created a great challenge that had to be pursued carefully by correcting for the additional wall thickness in order to obtain the right mixture density...|$|R
40|$|The Gunite and Associated Tanks (GAAT) are inactive, liquid {{low-level}} waste (LLLW) tanks located {{in and around}} the North and South Tank Farms (NTF and STF) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). These tanks, which contain a supernatant over a layer of radioactive sludge, are the subject of an ongoing treatability study that will determine the best way to remove the sludge and remediate the tanks. As part of this study, a preliminary assessment of liquid integrity (or ``tightness``) monitoring methods for the Gunite tanks has been conducted. Both an external and an internal liquid integrity monitoring method were evaluated, and a preliminary assessment of the liquid integrity of eight Gunite tanks was made with the internal method. The work presented in this report shows that six of the eight GAAT considered here are <b>liquid</b> <b>tight</b> and that, {{in the case of the}} other two, data quality was too poor to allow a conclusive decision. The analysis indicates that when the release detection approach described in this report is used during the upcoming treatability study, it will function as a sensitive and robust integrity monitoring system. Integrity assessments based on both the internal and external methods can be used as a means of documenting the integrity of the tanks before the initiation of in-tank operations. Assessments based on the external method can be used during these operations as a means of providing a nearly immediate indication of a release, should one occur. The external method of release detection measures the electrical conductivity of the water found in the dry wells associated with each of the tanks. This method is based on the fact that the conductivity of the liquid in the GAAT is very high, while the conductivity of the groundwater in the dry wells and the underdrain system for the GAAT is very low...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this project has been to design a ship for LNG trade between Port Moresby and Singapore, with a cargo capacity corresponding to a total freight work {{in the range of}} 1. 000, 000 - 800, 000 m 3 annually. The main design emphases have been on propulsion- and cargo handling systems. The project is divided in to three parts. The first part gives a thorough investigation into design theory and design optimization methods. The second part gives description of current state of the art within LNG carrier designs and technical interrelationships in ship design. The third part contains the ship design process, following the systematic approach illustrated below. Based on a qualitative analysis of the most promising containment systems offered in the market, LNT A-BOX was found favourable. The LNT A-BOX consists of an independent tank type A as primary barrier, with <b>liquid</b> <b>tight</b> thermal insulation connected to the hull compartment as secondary barrier, resulting in a fabrication friendly and cost effective design with access to both primary and secondary barrier for ease of inspection and repairs. The insulation system is built up by two layers of insulation and can either consist solely of polyurethane foam, polyurethane panels or expanded polystyrene panels or a combination of these. No obvious benefits of each insulation material were clear, so six different insulation systems were determined for further investigations. Based on the given trade rout, a cargo capacity within the range of 35, 500 - 49. 000 m 3, divided in three equal sized cargo tanks, were found necessary to meet required annual freight work as well as damage stability requirements. The physical parameters of each cargo tank were furthermore determined by dimension ratios from previously built IMO A tanks in combination of with free board evaluations on existing gas carriers. A maximum allowable insulation thickness of 1040 mm was set as constraint when determining required cargo hull compartment size. The cargo compartment size was furthermore used as basis in the ship design process. In order to determine ship dimensions and hull form, ship statistics and empirical formulas was used. DWT was initially determined from comparison ships with cargo capacities within the same range, and was further used to set initial ship dimensions. Based on initial dimensions, LWT was determined from recommended empirical formulas and coefficients. An idea of required installed power for propulsion was early set by statistics, and weight of machinery systems was determined by weight coefficients. Some ship dimension iterations were performed before final dimensions where set. Hull form was furthermore determined by empirical formulas and suggestions given in various literatures. Some minor changes where later on changes after determination of main engine alternatives, and during general arrangement modelling in Autocad. In order to select the best propulsion system for the vessel, evaluation of propulsion systems currently in use on LNG carriers were performed. Thermal efficiency, propulsion efficiency and fuel efficiency was decisive factors in the evaluation process. Slow speed duel fuel and diesel engines with direct drive and fixed propeller were found beneficial and MAN engines were selected. Required engine output was determined by resistance calculations. Boil-off handling systems for each propulsion systems have been selected based on recommendations given by engine supplier. In order to determine cost and power consumption of each system, statistics of previously built systems was gathered. Based on engine and boil-off handling evaluation the following ship configurations where determined as favourable for the vessel Ship configuration	 1 	 2 	 3 Propulsion system	MAN B&W 6 S 50 MEB 9 1 set. SMCR: 10680 kW at 117 RPM Direct drive, FPP 	MAN B&W 6 S 50 ME-GI-B 9 1 set.

Optimal insulation thickness of each insulation material was first identified by using a direct search optimization approach, and optimal insulation thickness was identified from NPV graphs given as function of insulation thickness. Insulation system 1 was identified as the best insulation material for all insulation thicknesses. In order to determine the best ship configuration, ship profitability for each configuration with optimal insulation thickness was estimated and the result is presented in the bar chart below...|$|E
