Two distinct mechanisms appear to retard mPER 1 nuclear entry. First, coexpression of mPER 2 leads to mPER 1 -mPER 2 heterodimer formation and cytoplasmic colocalization. Second, coexpression of CKIɛ leads to masking of the mPER 1 nuclear localization signal and phosphorylation-dependent cytoplasmic retention of both proteins.

40|$|Abstract—Cache locking is an {{effective}} technique to improve timing predictability in real-time systems. In static cache locking, the locked memory blocks remain unchanged throughout the program execution. Thus static locking may not be effective for large programs where multiple memory blocks are competing for few cache lines available for locking. In comparison, dynamic cache locking overcomes cache space limitation through time-multiplexing of locked memory blocks. Prior dynamic locking technique partitions the program into regions and takes indepen-dent locking decisions for each region. We propose a flexible loop-based dynamic cache locking approach. We not only select the memory blocks to be locked but also the locking points (e. g., loop level). We judiciously allow memory blocks from the same loop to be locked at different program points for WCET improvement. We design a constraint-based approach that incorporates a global view {{to decide on the}} number of locking slots at each <b>loop</b> <b>entry</b> point and then select the memory blocks to be locked for each loop. Experimental evaluation shows that our dynamic cache locking approach achieves substantial improvement of WCET compared to prior techniques. I...|$|E

The resulting novelty signal is conveyed through the subiculum, accumbens, and ventral pallidum to the VTA where it contributes (along with salience and goal information) to the novelty-dependent firing of these cells. In the upward arm of the loop, dopamine (DA) is released within the hippocampus; this produces an enhancement of LTP and learning.

40|$|Behaviour {{models are}} the most {{commonly}} used input for predicting the reliability of a software system at the early design stage. A component behaviour model reveals the structure and behaviour of the component during the execution of system-level functionalities. There are various challenges related to component reliability prediction at the early design stage based on behaviour models. For example, most of the current reliability techniques do not provide fine-grained sequential behaviour models of individual components and fail to consider the <b>loop</b> <b>entry</b> and exit points in the reliability computation. Moreover, some of the current techniques do not tackle the problem of operational data unavailability and the lack of analysis results that can be valuable for software architects at the early design stage. This paper proposes a reliability prediction technique that, pragmatically, synthesizes system behaviour {{in the form of a}} state machine, given a set of scenarios and corresponding constraints as input. The state machine is utilized as a base for generating the component-relevant operational data. The state machine is also used as a source for identifying the nodes and edges of a component probabilistic dependency graph (CPDG). Based on the CPDG, a stack-based algorithm is used to compute the reliability. The proposed technique is evaluated by a comparison with existing techniques and the application of sensitivity analysis to a robotic wheelchair system as a case study. The results indicate that the proposed technique is more relevant at the early design stage compared to existing works, and can provide a more realistic and meaningful prediction...|$|E

The conserved gB and gH/gL execute fusion. Central to understanding HSV entry/fusion has become the dissection of how the four glycoproteins engage in cross talk. While the independent interactions of gD with gB and gD with gH/gL have been documented, less is known of the interaction of gB with gH/gL. So far, this interaction has been detected only {{in the presence of}} gD by means of a split green fluorescent protein complementation assay. Here, we show that gB interacts with gH/gL in the absence of gD. The gB-gH/gL complex was best detected with a form of gB in which the endocytosis and phosphorylation motif have been deleted; this form of gB persists in the membranes of the exocytic pathway and is not endocytosed. The gB-gH/gL interaction was detected both in whole transfected cells by means of a split yellow fluorescent protein complementation assay and, biochemi-cally, by a pull-down assay. Results with a panel of chimeric forms of gB, in which portions of the glycoprotein bracketed by consecutive cysteines were replaced with the corresponding portions from human herpesvirus 8 gB, favor the view that gB carries multiple sites for interaction with gH/gL, and one of these sites is located in the pleckstrin-like domain 1 carrying the bipartite fusion <b>loop.</b> <b>Entry</b> of herpes simplex virus (HSV) into the cell requires...|$|E

These loops were crosslinked generating CL-EcoRV which binds and releases linear DNA only slowly, because threading linear DNA {{into and out}} of the DNA-binding 'tunnel' of CL-EcoRV is not very effective. If the crosslinking reaction is carried out with a circular bound DNA, CL-EcoRV is hyperactive towards the trapped substrate which is cleaved very quickly but not very accurately. CL-EcoRV also binds to, but does not cleave, circular DNA when added from the outside, because it cannot enter the active site.

Whereas abstract interpretation techniques typically over-approximate {{the set of}} reachable states iteratively, abstract accel-eration captures {{the effect of the}} loop with a single, non-iterative transfer function applied to the initial states at the loop head. In contrast to previous acceleration techniques, our approach applies to any linear loop without restrictions. Its novelty lies {{in the use of the}} Jordan normal form decomposition of the loop body to de-rive symbolic expressions for the entries of the matrix modeling the effect of n ≥ 0 iterations of the <b>loop.</b> The <b>entries</b> of such a matrix depend on n through complex polynomial, exponential and trigonometric functions. Therefore, we introduces an abstract do-main for matrices that captures the linear inequality relations be-tween these complex expressions. This results in an abstract matrix for describing the fixpoint semantics of the loop. Our approach integrates smoothly into standard abstract inter-preters and can handle programs with nested loops and loops con-taining conditional branches. We evaluate it over small but complex loops that are commonly found in control software, comparing it with other tools for computing linear loop invariants. The loops in our benchmarks typically exhibit polynomial, exponential and os-cillatory behaviors that present challenges to existing approaches. Our approach finds non-trivial invariants to prove useful bounds on the values of variables for such loops, clearly outperforming the existing approaches in terms of precision while exhibiting good performance. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Over {{the life}} of a modern computer, the energy cost of running the system can exceed the cost of the {{original}} hardware purchase. This has driven the community to attempt to understand and minimize energy costs wherever possible. Towards these ends, we present an automated, fine-grained approach to selecting per-loop processor clock frequencies. The clock frequency selection criteria is established through a combination of lightweight static analysis and runtime tracing that automatically acquires application signatures- characterizations of the patterns of execution of each loop in an application. This application characterization is matched with a series of benchmark loops, which have been run on the target system and exercise it various ways. These benchmarks are intended to form a covering set, a machine characterization of the expected power consumption and performance traits of the machine over the space of execution patterns and clock frequencies. The frequency that confers the best power-delay product to the benchmark that most closely resembles each application loop is the one chosen for that loop. The application’s frequency management strategy is then permanently integrated into the compiled executable via static binary instrumentation. This process is lightweight, only has to be done once per application (and the benchmarks just once per machine), and thus is much less laborious than running every application loop at every possible frequency on the machine to see what the optimal frequencies would be. Unlike most frequency management schemes, we toggle frequencies very frequently, potentially at every <b>loop</b> <b>entry</b> and exit, saving as much as 10 % of the energy bill in the process. The set of tools that implement this scheme is fully automated, built on top of freely available open source software, and uses an inexpensive power measurement apparatus. We use these tools to show a measured, system-wide energy savings of up to 7. 6 % o...|$|E
40|$|CMOS {{technology}} scaling {{improves the}} speed and functionality of microprocessors by reducing the size of transistors. Static power dissipation also increases {{as a result of}} scaling however, and has been identified as a limiting factor in technology scaling. As current technology approaches that limit, techniques are required both at the technology-level and in the architecture design to reduce sub-threshold leakage, which accounts for the majority of static power dissipation. This thesis presents an approach to predict the idle periods of execution units at runtime and power-gate them during these periods to eliminate their static power leakage. We exploit similar execution characteristics across loop iterations to build a prediction of the units required to execute an entire loop from the units used over the first few iterations. The utilisation of each execution unit is monitored for each iteration, and thresholds are used to determine which units should be power-gated {{for the remainder of the}} loop. Three techniques are presented: Loop-Directed Mothballing (LDM), Extended Loop-Directed Mothballing (ELDM) and schedule balancing. LDM power-gates execution units only during innermost loops, which are simple to detect at runtime. ELDM extends this method to all loops using <b>loop</b> <b>entry</b> and exit information gathered offline. The balancing scheduler is developed to balance the types of instruction issued each cycle, to encourage reuse of execution units and make unnecessary units easier to detect. Extensive simulation using traces of 16 benchmarks from the SPEC CPU 2006 suite demonstrates that LDM reduces the energy-delay product of our simulated superscalar processor by 10. 3 %. For traces with a low proportion of executed instructions inside innermost loops, ELDM improves the energy-delay product by up to 13 % by allowing the technique to be applied to other loops in the trace. Employing schedule balancing with ELDM achieves similar savings, and simplifies the hardware required to make predictions. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|International audienceEntry into mitosis or meiosis {{relies on}} the coordinated action of kinases and phosphatases that {{ultimately}} leads to the activation of Cyclin-B-Cdk 1, also known as MPF for M-phase promoting factor. Vertebrate oocytes are blocked in prophase of the first meiotic division, an arrest that is tightly controlled by high PKA activity. Re-entry into meiosis depends on activation of Cdk 1, which obeys a two-step mechanism: a catalytic amount of Cdk 1 is generated in a PKA and protein-synthesis-dependent manner; then a regulatory network known as the MPF auto-amplification loop is initiated. This second step is independent of PKA and protein synthesis. However, none of the molecular components of the auto-amplification loop identified so far act independently of PKA. Therefore, the protein rendering this process independent of PKA in oocytes remains unknown. Using a physiologically intact cell system, the Xenopus oocyte, we show that the phosphorylation of ARPP 19 at S 67 by the Greatwall kinase promotes its binding to the PP 2 A-B 55 delta phosphatase, thus inhibiting its activity. This process is controlled by Cdk 1 and has an essential role within the Cdk 1 auto-amplification <b>loop</b> for <b>entry</b> into the first meiotic division. Moreover, once phosphorylated by Greatwall, ARPP 19 escapes the negative regulation exerted by PKA. It also promotes activation of MPF independently of protein synthesis, provided that {{a small amount of}} Mos is present. Taken together, these findings reveal that PP 2 A-B 55 delta, Greatwall and ARPP 19 are not only required for entry into meiotic divisions, but are also pivotal effectors within the Cdk 1 auto-regulatory loop responsible for its independence with respect to the PKA-negative control...|$|R
