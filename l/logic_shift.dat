5000|$|Recent {{research}} has also documented the co-existence or potential conflict of multiple logics within particular organizations. Zilber (2002), for example, described the organizational consequences of a shift from one logic to another within an Israeli rape crisis center, in which new organization members reshaped the center and its practices to reflect a new dominant logic that they have carried into the organization. Tilcsik (2010) documented a <b>logic</b> <b>shift</b> in a post-Communist government agency, describing a conflict between the agency's old guard (carriers of the logic of Communist state bureaucracies) and its new guard (carriers of a market logic). This study shows that, paradoxically, an intra-organizational group's efforts to resist a particular logic might in fact open the organization's door to carriers of that very logic. Almandoz (2012) examined the embeddedness of new local banks' founding teams in a community logic or a financial logic, linking institutional logics to new banking venture's establishment and entrepreneurial success. As these studies demonstrate, the institutional logics perspective offers valuable insights into important intra-organizational processes affecting organizational practices, change, and success. These studies represent an effort to understand institutional complexity due to conflicting or inconsistent logics within particular organizations, a situation that might results from the entry of new organization members or the layering (or [...] "sedimentation") of new organizational imprints upon old ones over time.|$|E

In current VLSI circuits, where mixture of static and dynamic implementation is very common, {{it is important}} to identify possible noise failure modes to help designers develop techniques to prevent such failures. Injection of noise causes temporary or permanent signal deviation on a circuit node depending on the level of noise and the affected circuit. The deviation of signal level of the circuit node may lead to functional failure in digital circuits, particularly in dynamic circuit families.

40|$|With firms {{concentrating on}} core competencies, more {{emphasis}} {{has been placed}} on outsourcing and dealing with external sourcing agents. This has led to a stronger academic focus on buyer-seller exchanges and the corresponding mechanisms for governing these exchanges. This paper gives an overview of previous research investigating the exchange governance phenomenon based on transaction cost theory or co-operative interorganizational relationships. The results reveal that few research studies have investigated the overall picture of exchange governance, including both contractual and relational governance and taking into account antecedents as well as performance outcomes of the governance mechanisms involved. Moreover, despite the service-dominant <b>logic</b> <b>shift,</b> limited attention is given to specific service characteristics and their impact on exchange governance. This paper attempts to meld economic and social related antecedents into a model with regard to exchange governance in business services settings. Contractual and relational governance issues and their impact on performance outcomes are also considered. The resulting model indicates that to govern business services exchanges efficiently, more emphasis should be placed on behavioral uncertainty, human and process asset specificity and contractual governance.

40|$|This two-essay {{dissertation}} aims {{to study}} institutional logics {{in the context}} of Apple's independent third-party software developers. In essay 1, I investigate the embedded agency aspect of the institutional logics theory. It builds on the premise that logics constrain preferences, interests and behaviors of individuals and organizations, thereby determining the appropriate and legitimate decisions and actions of actors. In the meantime, most social actors operate in fields characterized by multiple institutional logics where contradictions exist, allowing individuals and organizations with opportunities for negotiation and change through exploitation or management of these contradictions. I specifically study two competing institutional logics: professional and market logics when they are experienced simultaneously by independent iOS app entrepreneurs. Using participant observation and semi-structured interviews, I delineate the ways in which logic tension is reconciled through mechanisms of logic synthesis in three entrepreneurial areas - app ideation, app execution and app marketing, and conditions which facilitate or inhibit logic synthesis. In essay 2, I study the emergence and evolution of field-level logics {{in the context of}} Apple's desktop developers - Mac indies. Following the cultural emergence model of field-level logics in Thornton et al. (2012), and the argument that "field-level logics are both embedded in societal-level logics and subject to field-level processes that generate distinct forms of instantiation, variation, and combination of societal logics" (p 148), I particularly examine the relationship between resource environment and the emergence and evolution of field-level logics. Taking advantage of a critical change in developers' resource environment - Apple's opening of the iOS App Store and subsequently the Mac App Store, and hence its governance model shifting from mainly a technological platform to a platform that includes a market exchange place, I identify developers' logics before and after the change, namely, the software ecosystem logic and platform ecosystem logic. Two ideal types are constructed for the logics along elemental categories, and a content analysis demonstrates the <b>logic</b> <b>shift</b> pattern as resource environments change. A further analysis of the two logics suggests that the software ecosystem logic and platform ecosystem logic are in contestation at this early stage of institutional change...|$|E

One variant emphasizes how logics can focus the attention of key decision-makers on {{a particular set of}} issues and solutions (Ocasio, 1997), leading to logic-consistent decisions (Thornton, 2002). A fair amount of research on logics has focused on the importance of dominant <b>logics</b> and <b>shifts</b> from one <b>logic</b> to another (e.g., Lounsbury, 2002; Thornton, 2002; Suddaby & Greenwood, 2005).

40|$|We {{explore the}} impact of {{corporate}} social responsibility (CSR) ratings on sell-side analysts' assessments of firms' future financial performance. We suggest that when analysts perceive CSR as an agency cost, due to the prevalence of an agency logic, they produce pessimistic recommendations for firms with high CSR ratings. Moreover, we theorize that over time, {{the emergence of a}} stakeholder focus, and the gradual weakening of the agency <b>logic,</b> <b>shifts</b> the analysts' perceptions of CSR ratings and results in increasingly less pessimistic recommendations for firms with high CSR ratings. Using a large sample of publicly traded U. S. firms over 15 years, we confirm that in the early 1990 s, analysts issue more pessimistic recommendations for firms with high CSR ratings. However, in more recent years analysts progressively assess these firms less pessimistically, and eventually they assess them optimistically. Furthermore, we find that more experienced analysts and analysts at higher-status brokerage houses are the first to shift the relation between CSR ratings and investment recommendation optimism. We find no significant link between firms' CSR ratings and analysts' forecast errors, indicating that learning is unlikely to account for the observed shifts in recommendations...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} new venture {{creation}} {{is characterized by}} the need to decide and take action in the face of uncertainty.

30|$|Thus, the S-D <b>logic</b> <b>shifts</b> {{the locus}} of value {{creation}} from the firm-level to the network-level. Instead of a linear sequence of events along a chain where firms individually contribute by value-adding activities, value creation processes in an emerging digital environment {{are based on the}} contribution of multiple stakeholders who integrate and apply resources for themselves and for others (Barret et al. 2015, pp. 137; El Sawy and Pereira 2013, p. 4; Lusch and Vargo 2014, pp. 136). The S-D logic is not just a re-conceptualization of economic exchange but helps to understand how firms create value in a digitally permeated economy. The generative character of digital technology makes products inherently unfinished. Firms constantly create new meanings of goods and services by redefining the product boundaries (Verganti 2009; Chandler and Vargo 2011). The dynamic and flexible nature of products makes it necessary to rethink the rather static added-value approach. The shift from the output of something to the process of doing something and the focus on use value instead of exchange value is, thus, a consequence of the evolving dynamics. Generativity is the primary source of value creation: Firms engage in increasingly dynamic, complex, and diverse networks of relationships in order to seek ways to create value. Consequently, the clear distinction of industries begins to vanish.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to answer the {{research}} question of how a service company (ServiceCo) could achieve a transfer price of its services. This is of particular interest, due to the growth of service firms that have rapidly increased and surpassed the manufacturing firms, as well as the dominant <b>logic</b> <b>shifting</b> towards services. However, the problem with this field of study is that transfer pricing with regards to the service industry, is a rather unexplored phenomenon in which the guidelines and theories are mostly directed towards manufacturing firms. This study uses a single case study approach where ServiceCo’s organizational characteristics were analyzed in order to attain the information required to understand how ServiceCo could achieve a transfer price of its services. Furthermore, this study uses the Eccles (1983) MAP and the OECD Guidelines, as well as incorporating Porter’s (1985) value chain. This study assesses that ServiceCo, in its current state, uses a sub-optimal transfer pricing method of its services. Therefore, a change in the transfer pricing method was suggested to ServiceCo. Given the organizational characteristics of ServiceCo, the results led to the conclusion that ServiceCo could benefit from a residual analysis in the profit split method, in which an actual full cost plus mark-up compensation could be used on its routine functions, and the residual profit could be split between the entities based on the intangible assets employed, functions performed and the risks carried...|$|R
