She arrived on the island two days later. In her defence, Sandiford claimed that she had been pressured into carrying the drugs by a gang who had made threats against her children, while her lawyers argued she was suffering from mental health problems. In a statement to the court she expressed regret over her involvement, [...] "I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> by apologising to the Republic of Indonesia and the Indonesian people for my involvement. I would never have become involved in something like this but the lives of my children were in danger and I felt I had to protect them." [...] Her son gave a statement to the court in which he said he believed she was forced to carry the drugs following a disagreement over rent money she had paid on his behalf. A report by Dr. Jennifer Fleetwood, a lecturer in criminology at the University of Kent and expert on women in the international drugs trade was also presented to the court, suggesting Sandiford was an ideal target for drug traffickers. [...] "There is … evidence to suggest that a trafficker would seek someone who was vulnerable. Having reviewed extracts from Lindsay's medical records I know that Lindsay has a history of mental health issues … This may have unfortunately made her an attractive target for threats, manipulation and coercion." ...|$|E

5000|$|The President's Management Agenda is {{an example}} of the {{increasing}} emphasis on results in government management. It states:"Government <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> things — <b>to</b> declare grand new programs and causes. But good beginnings are not the measure of success. What matters in the end is completion. Performance. Results." ...|$|R
6000|$|On Monday {{evening after}} dinner Mr. Everard {{and his son}} sat {{for a while in}} silence. They had not met since morning; and in the {{presence}} of the servants conversation had been scrupulously polite. Now, though they were both waiting <b>to</b> talk, neither <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin.</b> The older man was outwardly placid, when Leonard, a little flushed and a little nervous of voice, began: ...|$|R

6000|$|... "We can do {{very well}} without them, captain. There were thirty of us here two days ago. Essos and Polinski quarrelled, and Essos was killed. Then Polinski wanted us to elect him captain, and to move away at once. Four or five, who have always been grumblers, joined him at once, and persuaded some of the others, till we were about equally divided. It came pretty nearly to a fight; but neither <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin,</b> and they moved away." ...|$|R

6000|$|One of them {{declined}} the risk, {{but the other}} one said he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> again if the Major would join him. So they spread an overcoat over their knees and the game proceeded. Pretty soon the parlour-car conductor arrived, and said, brusquely: ...|$|E

She may have written to you because she would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> a {{correspondence}} with an author. Or she may have done {{it out of the}} love of excitement. Or for the sake of distraction, to get away from herself and her gloomy forebodings." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The question," [...] {{retorted}} Harry indignantly, [...] "is how it's to be done. I'll own up that I {{know very}} little about training dogs, and that's not the kind of one I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> on." [...] He turned to Frank. [...] "Considering that a good many of the ranchers live almost alone, it's rather a curious thing that there are very few dogs {{in this part of the}} country." ...|$|E
50|$|Silverman, who had {{not been}} {{informed}} of the commentary beforehand due to a series of communication failures, was furious. He believed that SNL producer Lorne Michaels, who {{was in the midst of}} negotiating a new contract, had orchestrated it as revenge for Silverman's failure to attend a meeting with Michaels to discuss those talks the previous day. After hundreds of letters and postcards were delivered to Silverman's office the following Monday, he refused to accept a letter of apology offered by Franken, whom he said later he had never <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> with.|$|R

60|$|He was {{practicing}} law in London still, {{but he had}} had time to repent of having been {{on the wrong side}} when he saw what it had come to, and had the Protector at the head of affairs. He said, however, that negotiations for peace with France were <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin,</b> and that Mr. Secretary Milton was casting about for one learned in French law to assist in drawing the papers, so that he had little doubt that Mr. Darpent would be readily taken into one of the public officers in London.|$|E

But it's a disagreeable affair all round. What a character for anybody with decent connections to show himself in!--one of those newspaper fellows! You have only to look at Keck, who manages the 'Trumpet.' I saw him the other day with Hawley. His writing is sound enough, I believe, but he's such a low fellow, that I wished {{he had been on}} the wrong side." ...|$|E

6000|$|Having shaken hands, the wrestlers <b>began</b> <b>to</b> walk round each other, eagerly {{looking for}} a chance to get the [...] "catch." [...] It seemed at first as if neither <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin,</b> when, suddenly, the Bulgarian turned sharp on Petroff, and tried a {{favourite}} throw; but with the lithe easy motion of a panther, the blacksmith eluded his grasp. The excitement of the spectators became intense, for it now seemed as if the two huge fellows were well-matched, and that a prolonged struggle was about to take place. This, however, was a mistake. The villagers apparently had underrated the powers of their own champion, and the gipsy girls looked anxious, evidently fearing that the hitherto victorious stranger would again triumph.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, so have I. I {{should think}} that it is a very likely place for a man like Bastow to go to if he has any liking for play. Of course he would get up as a gentleman. At any rate, I have been making what {{inquiries}} I can in some of the thieves' quarters, and {{have come to the conclusion}} that he is not likely to have taken up his abode there, and I don't think I can do better than make a round of some of these doubtful houses. I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> with this, and then work downwards." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite. There's {{nothing wrong}} with me now except here." [...] She drew his hand to her and pressed it against her heart. [...] "What's given, one can't get back. I can't help it; I would if I could. It's been so dreadful for you. I'm so sorry." [...] Winton made an unintelligible sound, and she went on: [...] "If I had them to see after, I shouldn't {{be able to think}} so much; the more I had to do the better. Good for our gipsy-bird, too, to have them there. I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> it at once." ...|$|E
