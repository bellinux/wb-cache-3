40|$|The Power Management and Distribution (PMAD) DC Testbed Control System for Space Station Freedom was {{developed}} using a top down approach based on classical control system and conventional terrestrial power utilities design techniques. The design methodology includes {{the development of}} a testbed operating concept. This operating concept describes the operation of the testbed under all possible scenarios. A unique set of operating states was identified and a description of each state, along with state transitions, was generated. Each state is represented by a unique set of attributes and constraints, and its description reflects the degree of system security within which the power system is operating. Using the testbed operating states description, a functional design for the control system {{was developed}}. This functional design consists of a functional outline, a text description, and a <b>logical</b> <b>flowchart</b> for all the major control system functions. Described here are the control system design techniques, various control system functions, and the status of the design and implementation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes to}} {{highlight}} the importance of developing of a business plan, which is an indispensable tool for any entrepreneur, aims to reduce the degree of uncertainty in entrepreneurial activity, to reduce the company's environmental vulnerability. Thus {{the objectives of the}} paper consist on presentation of the concept define, the role, the functions of the business plan, also the typology, the stages concerning the preparation and the content. of it. The research method was to use a comparative study of the specialty literature. The business plan represents a <b>logical</b> <b>flowchart</b> of action, which involves perspective on thinking on a business, starting from certain objectives, helping to create an overall picture of the whole business. Basically it covers all stages and resources which will be necessary to an entrepreneur to achieve the proposed objectives in a predetermined time period. The business plan offers the possibility to assess the chances of success of businesses, representing a means to control for the entrepreneur on profitability and business viability through a systemic analysis of a comprehensive set of rigorously structured informations, providing thereby the knowing of all aspects involved in business and the effective and in depth preparing...|$|E
40|$|Design of {{integrated}} solutions fusing existing facility practices with emerging technology is creating new platforms for enhancing operations. Review of current business methods uncovered several areas of improvement including; operating efficiency, document routing, accountability, reporting, records management, format standardization, and control system interaction. A new Defense Programs (DP) facility at the Savannah River Site (SRS) is implementing an electronic procedure environment {{to overcome these}} challenges. Electronic procedures merge disciplines of design engineering, procedure writing, controls engineering, and operations into a central development platform for creating optimal plant processes. Users develop procedures {{through a combination of}} <b>logical</b> <b>flowcharts,</b> customizable properties, and Distributed Control System (DCS) functions resulting in the generation of static and dynamic operating procedures, software documentation, and automation code. Execution of developed procedures occurs in a single, uniform, procedure-oriented interface designed specifically for the operator in order to reduce process mistakes, present online information, list approved procedures, organize systems, launch audible alerts, and strengthen communications with automation. Creation of executed documents upon procedure completion and custom reports containing detailed shift turnover information are additional managerial benefits incorporated into the interface. Initial and continuing application improvements from an evaluation of developer feedback, process configurations, and facility integration are reviewed. Incorporation of manual and automated electronic procedures into the Novatech D/ 3 Distributed Control System (DCS) and other sub-systems is also discussed with specific examples. A final analysis is performed on the results of meeting facility challenges and potential areas for new application expansion and growth...|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} an overview of the activities to date and schedule for future testing, validation, and authorized enhancements of Natural Gas Systems Analysis Model (GSAM). The goal of this report is to inform DOE managers of progress in model development and to provide a benchmark for ongoing and future research. Section II of the report provides a detailed discussion on the major GSAM development programs performed and completed during the period of performance, July 1, 1998 to September 30, 1999. Key improvements in the new GSAM version are summarized in Section III. Programmer's guides for GSAM main modules were produced to provide detailed descriptions of all major subroutines and main variables of the computer code. General <b>logical</b> <b>flowcharts</b> of the subroutines are also presented in the guides to provide overall picture of interactions between the subroutines. A standard structure of routine explanation is applied in every programmer's guide. The explanation is started with a brief description or main purpose of the routine, lists of input and output files read and created, and lists of invoked/child and calling/parent routines. In some of the guides, interactions between the routine itself and its parent and child routines are presented in the form of graphical flowchart. The explanation is then proceeded with step by step description of computer code in the subroutine where each step delegates a section of related code. Between steps, if a certain section of code needs further explanation, a Note is inserted with relevant explanation...|$|R
40|$|Instructions for {{operating}} a control panel {{were presented in}} five different formats: <b>flowchart,</b> <b>logical</b> tree, yes/no tree, decision table, and list. Subjects had to choose one out of eight buttons, depending on the settings of the control panel. The {{results show that the}} decision table resulted in more errors, and that both the decision table and the list took longer than the three other formats, which did not show mutual differences. It turned out that the subjects valued most the format they had been using, except for those who had worked with the list. It is suggested that the users' ease of orientation for a diagram's format, both during reading and after “switching” between equipment and instructional text, explains the differences between the format...|$|R
