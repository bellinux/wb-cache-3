40|$|The cDNA for the {{sea urchin}} {{mitochondrial}} D-loop-binding protein (mtDBP), a 40 kDa protein which binds two homologous regions of mitochondrial DNA (the D-loop {{region and the}} boundary between the oppositely transcribed ND 5 and ND 6 genes), has been cloned. Four different 3 '-untranslated regions have been detected that are related to each other in pairs and do not contain the canonical polyadenylation signal. The in vitro synthesised mature protein (348 amino acids), deprived of the putative signal sequence, binds specifically to its DNA target sequence and produces a DNase I footprint identical to that given by the natural protein. mtDBP contains two <b>leucine</b> <b>zippers,</b> one of which is bipartite, and two small N- and C-terminal basic domains. A deletion mutation analysis of the recombinant protein has shown that the N-terminal region and the two <b>leucine</b> <b>zippers</b> are necessary for the binding. Furthermore, evidence was provided that mtDBP binds DNA as a monomer. This rules out a dimerization role for the <b>leucine</b> <b>zippers</b> and rather suggests that intramolecular interactions between <b>leucine</b> <b>zippers</b> take place. A database search has revealed as the most significative homology a match with the human mitochondrial transcription termination factor (mTERF), a protein that also binds DNA as a monomer and contains three <b>leucine</b> <b>zippers</b> forming intramolecular interactions. These similarities, and the observation that mtDBP-binding sites contain the 3 '-ends of mtRNAs coded by opposite strands and the 3 '-end of the D-loop structure, point to a dual function of the protein in modulating sea urchin mitochondrial DNA transcription and replication...|$|R

2500|$|In 2000, Ghosh et al {{developed}} {{a system that}} allowed a green fluorescent protein (GFP) to be reassembled using an anti-parallel <b>leucine</b> <b>zipper</b> in E. coli cells. This was achieved by dissecting GFP into C- and N-terminal GFP fragments. As the GFP fragment was attached to each <b>leucine</b> <b>zipper</b> by a linker, the heterodimerisation of the anti-parallel <b>leucine</b> <b>zipper</b> resulted in a reconstituted, or re-formed, GFP protein that could be visualised. [...] The successful fluorescent signal indicated that the separate GFP peptide fragments were able to correctly reassemble and achieve tertiary folding. It was, therefore, postulated that using this technique, fragmented GFP {{could be used to}} study interaction of protein–protein pairs that have their N–C termini in close proximity.|$|E

2500|$|Coiled-coil α helices {{are highly}} stable forms {{in which two}} or more helices wrap around {{each other in a}} [...] "supercoil" [...] structure. Coiled coils contain a highly {{characteristic}} sequence motif known as a heptad repeat, in which the motif repeats itself every seven residues along the sequence (amino acid residues, not DNA base-pairs). The first and especially the fourth residues (known as the a and d positions) are almost always hydrophobic; the fourth residue is typically leucine this gives rise to the name of the structural motif called a <b>leucine</b> <b>zipper,</b> which is a type of coiled-coil. These hydrophobic residues pack together in the interior of the helix bundle. In general, the fifth and seventh residues (the e and g positions) have opposing charges and form a salt bridge stabilized by electrostatic interactions. Fibrous proteins such as keratin or the [...] "stalks" [...] of myosin or kinesin often adopt coiled-coil structures, as do several dimerizing proteins. A pair of coiled-coils a four-helix bundle is a very common structural motif in proteins. For example, it occurs in human growth hormone and several varieties of cytochrome. The Rop protein, which promotes plasmid replication in bacteria, is an interesting case in which a single polypeptide forms a coiled-coil and two monomers assemble to form a four-helix bundle.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Coiled coils {{possess a}} {{quaternary}} structure comprised of the side-by-side arrangement of a-helices. Due their inherent structural simplicity, they are ideal model systems for both theoretical and experimental studies. Among the coiled coils are the <b>leucine</b> <b>zippers,</b> which {{play an important}} role in the activation of DNA transcription. In contrast to the large amount of available experimental data, an overview of which is presented, there are very few theoretical studies. To address this need, the status of existing theoretical approaches to predict coiled coil quaternary structure is described. Furthermore, to treat the conformational equilibria inherent in these systems, an extension of entropy sampling Monte Carlo simulations is developed that can treat multimers. Here, the approach is applied to GCN 4 <b>leucine</b> <b>zippers</b> in the context of a reduced protein model. Not only is the native conformation successfully predicted, but the model also reproduces the experimentally observed helix content in the denatured state and the observed two-state thermodynamic behavior. Such two-state behavior arises from the dissociation of highly helical dimeric chains to form monomers of low, isolated chai...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA highly {{specific}} {{method for}} the dissociation of protein dimers has been developed. The method involves {{exposure of the}} dimers to free leucine at a concentration ranging between 3 and 10 mM. Using this method it has been possible to dissociate goat uterine oestrogen receptor homodimers, heterodimers formed between the non-activated oestrogen receptor (naER) and the oestrogen receptor activation factor (E-RAF) of the goat uterus, c-jun homodimers derived from bovine bone marrow and also glucocorticoid receptor homodimers isolated from rat liver cytosol. The pattern of dimer dissociation by leucine clearly differentiates two classes of proteins. The first is represented by steroid hormone receptors where dimerization is apparently contributed by both coiled-coil dimerization interfaces and the conserved heptad repeats of leucine. The second is represented by oncoproteins like c-fos and c-jun which dimerize through the exclusive involvement of <b>leucine</b> <b>zippers.</b> The patterns of dissociation of these two groups of proteins from the concerned affinity columns are distinctly different. This indicates a possibility that the elution pattern {{may be used as}} a yardstick to determine whether two proteins dimerize through the exclusive involvement of <b>leucine</b> <b>zippers</b> or whether coiled-coil interfaces are also involved in the dimerization process...|$|R

40|$|We {{screened}} {{a chicken}} liver cDNA expression library with a probe spanning the distal {{region of the}} chicken vitellogenin II (VTGII) gene promoter and isolated clones for a transcription factor that we have named VBP (for vitellogenin gene-binding protein). VBP binds {{to one of the}} most important positive elements in the VTGII promoter and appears to play a pivotal role in the estrogen-dependent regulation of this gene. The protein sequence of VBP was deduced from a nearly full length cDNA copy and was found to contain a basic/zipper (bZIP) motif. As expected for a bZIP factor, VBP binds to its target DNA site as a dimer. Moreover, VBP is a stable dimer free in solution. A data base search revealed that VBP is related to rat DBP. However, despite the fact that the basic/hinge regions of VBP and DBP differ at only three amino acid positions, the DBP binding site in the rat albumin promoter is a relatively poor binding site for VBP. Thus, the optimal binding sites for VBP and DBP may be distinct. Similarities between the VBP and DBP <b>leucine</b> <b>zippers</b> are largely confined to only four of the seven helical spokes. Nevertheless, these <b>leucine</b> <b>zippers</b> are functionally compatible and appear to define a novel subfamily.
