2500|$|The second {{generation}} Umnumzaan saw numerous modifications that utilizes {{some of the}} newer technologies found on the Sebenza 25. The single-most visual change was replacing the oversized custom pivot with a more traditional (Sebenza-style) pivot brushing. This new pivot no longer requires the Umnumzaan Take-down Tool and instead a traditional hex wrench {{is all that is}} needed to disassemble and reassemble the knife. This pivot is larger than most blade pivot brushing systems and is identical to the one used on the newer Large Sebenza 25 (mid-2012 release and with a pivot that is significantly thicker than the pivot used on the previous Large Sebenza 21). This pivot also incorporates a newer generation washer system with larger washer perforations, which helps retain <b>lubricating</b> <b>grease</b> better than previous designs, while simultaneously keeping elements out of the pivot system to increase service intervals. The change in pivot and washers is complimented by the modifications made to the ceramic ball and detent system, in which a larger ceramic ball in a slightly different location is used to make opening smoother and reduce wear (although it is unclear as to exactly when this specific change began).|$|E
2500|$|Beatings at Kemna, as {{at other}} early {{concentration}} camps, were frequent, {{beginning with the}} [...] "welcome beating" [...] on arrival at the camp right through to having to run a gauntlet when leaving. Because prisoners and guards were political opponents who were former neighbors and co-workers, punishment and torture at Kemna took on a personal nature. Prisoners were brought to interrogations naked and gagged with cloth stuffed in their mouths, were tied to special whipping benches, where they were whipped with rubber clubs, whips and sticks. Bleeding, they were then locked in a cubicle under the stairs, where they could neither sit nor stand and cigarette smoke was blown through the air holes. Beforehand, prisoners were made to eat [...] "appetizers" [...] of unsoaked salt herring smeared with <b>lubricating</b> <b>grease</b> or feces; when they regurgitated, {{they were forced to}} lick up the vomit. In November, prisoners with fresh wounds were thrown into the cold waters of the Wupper and afterwards, made to stay in their wet clothes. There were also simulated executions. According to one former SA paramedic, about 25 prisoners attempted suicide; others succeeded or simply died from the effects of the torture. Some survivors were crippled mentally or physically from their treatment, some {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} that recycled low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and lithium thickener concentrations exerts on the thermal and rheological properties of lithium <b>lubricating</b> <b>greases</b> was investigated using different rheological techniques in a temperature range of 25 – 175 ◦C. In this way, different lubri-cating grease formulations were manufactured by modifying {{the concentration of}} lithium 12 -hydroxystearate and content of recycled LDPE. These <b>lubricating</b> <b>greases</b> were rheologi-cally characterized through small-amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) and viscous flow measurements. In addition, bomb oxidation tests (BOTs) and thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis were carried out. From the experimental results obtained, it can be deduced that modified lithium <b>lubricating</b> <b>greases</b> can be considered thermo-rheologically complex materials. Different behaviors of the viscoelastic modulus with temperature {{as a function of}} thickener and recycled LDPE concentration were found. Two types of viscous flow behavior were observed de-pending on the grease composition: A plateau region appeared {{in a wide range of}} shear rates and, in some cases, a minimum in the flow curve was more pronounced at high temperatures.

30|$|Three {{kinds of}} new {{conductive}} <b>lubricating</b> <b>greases</b> were prepared using lithium ionic liquids {{as the base}} oil and the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) as the thickener. These lithium ionic liquids ([Li(PEG)X]) were obtained by blending lithium salts (LiBF 4, LiPF 6 and LiNTf 2) with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) because lithium salts have an extremely high solubility in PEG. The conductivities and contact resistances of the prepared <b>lubricating</b> <b>greases</b> were investigated using the DDSJ- 308 A conductivity meter and the reciprocating ball-on-disk UMT- 2 MT sliding tester.

The {{results suggest that the}} prepared <b>lubricating</b> <b>greases</b> have high conductivities and excellent tribological properties.

Moreover, IOMMT as a novel lubricant additive (1.5 wt% in grease) significantly enhances the friction reducing and anti-wear abilities for steel/steel contact that comprises a unique layered structure to prevent friction between the contact pairs and the protective tribofilm generated by physical adsorption and chemical reaction.|$|R
40|$|The {{scope of}} this study is to {{elucidate}} the physical mechanisms influencing the transient flow behavior of <b>lubricating</b> <b>greases</b> based on biogenic oleochemicals from a polarity point of view. This includes the mutually interacting influence of base oil polarity and thickening agents on the rheologically-measured mechanical structural degradation in transient shear flow. Due to the high temperature dependence of Keesom forces in the background of polar-active bond mechanisms, the analysis of the transient flow response as a function of temperature allows to attribute the observed influences to differences in base oil polarity. In general, clay-thickened greases show a greater tendency to be rheologically influenced by base oil polarities than soap-thickened <b>lubricating</b> <b>greases...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Lubricating</b> <b>greases</b> {{are widely}} used in several heavily loaded tribopairs such as rolling element bearings, gears, chains, etc. Each {{application}} represents its own unique load/speed/temperature operating condition that the grease needs to be designed to. Since the non-conforming surfaces are elastically deformed and the pressure involved sufficiently high to give significant effects on viscosity the prevailing lubrication mechanism in <b>grease</b> <b>lubricated</b> pairs is elastohydrodynamic (EHL). However, under more severe loading case and low speeds in transient operation a boundary lubrication component may appear, i. e. when metal surfaces actually come into direct contact with no fluid layer between. The additive formulations of greases integrate a substantial degree of components that reduce wear in boundary conditions. Different types and combinations of thickeners and base oils, along with supplemental structure modifiers and performance additives, combine to give the end user product its special lubricating properties. In this paper the performances of nano-formulated grease through inorganic based additives were tested. In particular, one-pot syntheses was used to obtain free-floating nanosheets of tungsten and/or molybdenum disulphide functionalized by long chain amines {{in the form of}} fluid suspension or solid paste. The nanosheets obtained are constituted by one or few layers of crystalline metal chalcogenides completely covered by an organic coating. With respect to similar inorganic materials, the presence of coating stabilizes the suspension, avoids aggregation and oxidation phenomena. The nano-materials, successfully tested in base lubricating oils, were dispersed in the <b>lubricating</b> <b>greases</b> and compared by rheological and tribological tests to the conventional <b>lubricating</b> <b>greases...</b>|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work was the incorporation of reactive isocyanate groups into chitin and chitosan in order to effectively use the products as reactive thickening agents in castor oil. The resulting gel-like dispersions could be potentially used as biodegradable <b>lubricating</b> <b>greases.</b> Three different NCO–functionalized polymers were obtained: two of them by promoting the reaction of chitosan with 1, 6 -hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDI), and the other by using chitin instead of chitosan. These polymers were characterized through 1 H-NMR, FTIR and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Thermal and rheological behaviours of the oleogels prepared by dispersing these polymers in castor oil were studied by means of TGA and small-amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) measurements. The evolution {{and values of the}} linear viscoelasticity functions with frequency for –NCO–functionalized chitosan- and chitin-based oleogels are quite similar to those found for standard <b>lubricating</b> <b>greases.</b> In relation to long-term stability of these oleogels, no phase separation was observed and the values of viscoelastic functions increase significantly during the first seven days of ageing, and then remain almost constant. TGA analysis showed that the degradation temperature of the resulting oleogels is higher than that found for traditional <b>lubricating</b> <b>greases.</b> This work is part of a research project (CTQ 2010 - 15338) sponsored by a MINECO-FEDER Programme (70 % European cofunding rate).
