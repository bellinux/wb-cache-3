50|$|Elsewhere in the {{shipping}} industry, cargo is normally {{measured by the}} metric tonne, but RORO cargo is typically measured in lanes in metres (LIMs). This is calculated by multiplying the cargo <b>length</b> <b>in</b> <b>metres</b> {{by the number of}} decks and by its width in lanes (lane width differs from vessel to vessel, and there are several industry standards). On PCCs, cargo capacity is often measured in RT or RT43 units (based on a 1966 Toyota Corona, the first mass-produced car to be shipped in specialised car-carriers and used as the basis of RORO vessel size. 1 RT is approximately 4m of lane space required to store a 1.5m wide Toyota Corona) or in car-equivalent units (CEU).|$|E
5000|$|The {{focal length}} of the {{paraboloid}} {{is related to the}} angular speed at which the liquid is rotated by the equation: , where [...] is the focal length, [...] is the rotation speed, and [...] is the acceleration due to gravity.

50|$|In 1996, after scrutinizing 73 {{great white}} shark specimens, Michael D. Gottfried, Leonard Compagno and S. Curtis Bowman {{proposed}} a linear relationship between the shark's total length and {{the height of the}} largest upper anterior tooth. The proposed relationship is: total <b>length</b> <b>in</b> <b>metres</b> &#61; − (0.096) × maximum height (mm)-(0.22). Gottfried and colleagues then extrapolated their technique to C. megalodon. The biggest C. megalodon tooth in the possession of this team, one discovered by Compagno in 1993, was an upper second anterior specimen, the maximum height of which was 168 mm. It yielded an estimated total length for C. megalodon of 15.9 m. Rumors of larger C. megalodon teeth persisted at the time. The maximum tooth height for this method is measured as a vertical line from the tip of the crown {{to the bottom of the}} lobes of the root, parallel to the long axis of the tooth. In layman's terms, the maximum height of the tooth is its slant height.|$|E
5000|$|The young {{human eye}} can change focus from {{distance}} (infinity) to {{as near as}} 6.5 cm from the eye. This dramatic change in focal power of the eye of approximately 15 dioptres (the reciprocal of focal <b>length</b> <b>in</b> <b>metres)</b> occurs {{as a consequence of}} a reduction in zonular tension induced by ciliary muscle contraction. This process can occur in as little as 350 milliseconds [...] The amplitude of accommodation declines with age. By the fifth decade of life the accommodative amplitude can decline so that the near point of the eye is more remote than the reading distance. When this occurs the patient is presbyopic. Once presbyopia occurs, those who are emmetropic (do not require optical correction for distance vision) will need an optical aid for near vision; those who are myopic (nearsighted and require an optical correction for distance vision), will find that they see better at near without their distance correction; and those who are hyperopic (farsighted) will find that they may need a correction for both distance and near vision. Note that these effects are most noticeable when the pupil is large; i.e. in dim light. The age-related decline in accommodation occurs almost universally to less than 2 dioptres by the time a person reaches 45 to 50 years, by which time most of the population will have noticed a decrease in their ability to focus on close objects and hence require glasses for reading or bifocal lenses. Accommodation decreases to about 1 dioptre at the age of 70 years. The dependency of accommodation amplitude on age is graphically summarized by Duane's classical curves.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to support {{literature}} representing the importance of lower body technique in the over-arm throw through the comparison of skilled and un-skilled cricket players. Ball velocity, stride <b>length</b> (<b>in</b> <b>metres</b> and as a percentage of performer's body height), trunk forward tilt and the change in knee angle from front foot contact to ball release were compared between performers to check for variations in technique. The Twenty participant (10 skilled and 10 un skilled) performers performed 20 successful throws at maximum velocity at a target area at stump from 20 m distance. Cricket players were filmed and digitized and data was entered into SPSS where independent t-tests was run to check for significant differences (p <. 05) in the parameters between the cricket ball throwers. Results showed significant differences in stride length (m), knee flexion, trunk flexion, ball velocity, and stride length (% body height). Findings suggest that lower body technique in the throw is of high importance and more time should be devoted to it during the coaching of the throw.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Supermarkets provide {{healthy and}} {{affordable}} food options while simultaneously heavily promoting energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods and drinks. Store size may impact body weight via multiple mechanisms. Large stores encourage purchasing of more {{food in a}} single visit, and in larger packages. In addition they provide greater product choice (usually at lower prices) and allow greater exposure to foods of all types. These characteristics may promote purchasing and consumption. Our objective {{was to assess the}} relationship between supermarket size and obesity, which has rarely been assessed. RESULTS: Data on supermarket size (measured as total aisle <b>length</b> <b>in</b> <b>metres)</b> was from 170 stores in eight developed countries with Western-style diets. Data for national obesity prevalence was obtained from the UK National Obesity Observatory. We found a strong correlation between average store size and national obesity prevalence (r[*]=[*] 0. 96). CONCLUSIONS: Explanations for the association between store size and national obesity prevalence may include larger and less frequent shopping trips and greater choice and exposure to foods in countries with larger stores. Large supermarkets may represent a food system that focuses on quantity ahead of quality and therefore may be an important and novel environmental indicator of a pattern of behaviour that encourages obesity...|$|E
