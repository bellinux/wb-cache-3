40|$|Abstract: GTM have {{developed}} a primary torque standard which covers the range from 1 Nm to 1 kNm with a single load frame and only one weight stack per direction of operation. The design comprises a double-sided lever, supported on strain-controlled elastic hinges, a binary weight stack of exchange disk design for each direction, mounting accessories for the transducer under test and a counter-torque drive with servo-controller. Compared to conventional types with air bearings and a multitude of several stacks, the chosen design offers distinctive advantages: Higher reliability of the <b>lever</b> <b>support,</b> less complicated auxiliary systems, easier method of operation, low overall height. Calculations show that the parasitic moment of the crossed hour-glass shaped springs for the <b>lever</b> <b>support</b> can be controlled to less than 10 - 5 Nm for a 1 kNm machine, and that the uncertainty of lever length falls within a 20 ppm band, including the equality of both sides.

The TSM has three mass stacks to cover all transducer capacities from 20 N·m up to 3000 N·m in each ten steps. The masses are calibrated within 5 · 10 - 6 by German DKD. The lever arms were precisely adjusted and also DKD-calibrated within 5 · 10 - 6. The adjustment procedure is described. The measurement uncertainty is calculated by the design data according GUM. In addition the best measurement capability of the TSM and the relative deviations are calculated by the results of several torque transfer standards, former calibrated at PTB.

Although {{there has been}} some work on mechanistic reasoning in the research literature and standards documents, much of this work targets domain-general characterizations of mechanistic reasoning; this study provides domain-specific illustrations of mechanistic reasoning. The data in this study comes from the Assessment of Mechanistic Reasoning Project (AMRP) (Weinberg, 2012), designed using item response theory modeling to diagnose individuals’ mechanistic reasoning about systems of levers. Such a characterization of mechanistic reasoning illuminates what is easy and difficult about this form of reasoning, within the subdomain of simple machines. Moreover, this work indicates how domain-general principles may be limited. The study participants included elementary, middle, and high school students as well as college undergraduates and adults without higher education. Although the majority of participants responded to the AMRP by diagnosing at least one mechanistic element (elements inherent to the working of systems of levers) as they predicted its motion, such reasoning was not trivial.

40|$|For {{some types}} of visuo-motor transformations like large visuo-motor {{rotations}} or the complex transformation of a sliding first-order lever, distinct adaptive processes have been hypothesized that produce a rapid, discrete approximation of the transformation and a slow, graded fine tuning, respectively. Here we investigate whether part-task training of only the second of these processes, namely the fine tuning, transfers to the subsequent performance in a condition with the full transformation of the sliding first-order lever. Therefore, we compared performance of three groups with different practice conditions during transfer to the full transformation. While two groups only practiced the fine tuning without the right-left inversion of the lever prior to transfer, a third group practiced the full lever transformation. Our results show a positive, but less than perfect transfer of the isolated practice of the fine tuning on performance with the full transformation. For the fine tuning itself, transfer was not reliably different from being perfect. The observation that the fine tuning can be acquired separately and added to the later adaptation to the left-right inversion of the <b>lever</b> <b>supports</b> the notion that these slow and fast processes progress rather independently. The additional finding that the preceding acquisition of the fine tuning also facilitates the subsequent rapid process {{could be due to}} generalized learning-to-learn or to a more precise assignment of movement errors to the process from which they originate...|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{transit telescope}} was not {{placed in the}} middle of the axis, but nearer to one end, to prevent the axis from bending under the weight of the telescope. Later, it was usually placed in the centre of the axis, which consisted of one piece of brass or gun metal with turned cylindrical steel pivots at each end. Several instruments were made entirely of steel, which was much more rigid than brass. The pivots rested on V-shaped bearings, either set into massive stone or brick piers which supported the instrument, or attached to metal frameworks on the tops of the piers. The temperature of the bearings was monitored by thermometers.The piers were usually separate from the foundation of the building, to prevent transmission of vibration from the building to the telescope. To relieve the pivots from the weight of the instrument, which would have distorted their shape, each end of the axis was supported by a hook with friction rollers, suspended from a <b>lever</b> <b>supported</b> by the pier, counterbalanced so as to leave only about 10 pounds force (45 N) on each bearing. In some cases, the counterweight pushed up on the bearing from below. The bearings were set nearly in a true east-west line, but fine adjustment was possible by horizontal and vertical screws. A spirit level was used to monitor for any inclination of the axis to the horizon. Eccentricity (an off-center condition) of the telescope's axis was accounted for, in some cases, by providing another telescope through the axis itself. By observing the motion of an artificial star through this axis telescope as the main telescope was rotated, the shape of the pivots, and any wobble of the axis, could be determined.|$|R

The objective {{of this study is to}} identify: i) the main obstacles to crop diversification at agro-industrial supply chain and farm levels; ii) the levers that can be employed to encourage these stakeholders to integrate greater crop diversity within their production system. An interdisciplinary analysis framework was used, integrating farming system agronomy, sociotechnical transition approach and new institutional economics. This theoretical framework is centred on the "technological lock-in" theory, derived from the innovation economy, and socio-technical transition theory, which proposes potential "break-out" avenues. This framework is tested on twelve crop diversification cases studies with three in-depth analyses. Our results show that the socio-technical system organized on the basis of dominant crops and the simplification of cropping plans is therefore an obstacle to the development of diversification crops as a result of various closely interlinked processes: (i) genetic progress that is less rapid than for "major crops"; (ii) a lack of crop protection solutions (agrochemicals one but also genetic and agronomic ones); (iii) a shortage of technical references concerning minor crops to explain low yield or quality defects at regional scale; (iv) a competition with "major crops" on the raw material market not only due to price but also accessibility and homogeneity differences (v) the diversity of coordination methods between the different stakeholders in the supply chains Finally, to encourage the development of diversification crops, it would appear to be essential to act simultaneously on three <b>levers</b> <b>supported</b> by public action: (1) Promotion of new market outlets, (2) Coordination of stakeholders and structuration of supply chains and (3) getting R&D, advisory and plant breeding actors involved on a national nd regional level to develop innovative technologies and varieties...|$|R

We then examine the appropriate debt management policy for the consolidated government. We argue that traditional considerations favoring longer-term debt may be overstated, and suggest that there are several advantages to issuing greater quantities of short-term debt. Under current institutional arrangements, neither the Federal Reserve nor the Treasury is caused to view debt management policy {{on the basis of the}} overall national interest.

Electrometer.--The {{measuring}} instrument I have employed {{has been the}} torsion balance electrometer of Coulomb, constructed, generally, according to his directions[A], but with certain variations and additions, which I will briefly describe. The lower part was a glass cylinder eight inches in height and eight inches in diameter; the tube for the torsion thread was seventeen inches in length. The torsion thread itself was not of metal, but glass, according to the excellent suggestion of the late Dr. Ritchie[B]. It was twenty inches in length, and of such tenuity that when the shell-lac lever and attached ball, &c. were connected with it, they made about ten vibrations in a minute. It would bear torsion through four revolutions or 1440°, and yet, when released, return accurately to its position; probably it would have borne considerably more than this without injury. The repelled ball was of pith, gilt, and was 0.3 of an inch in diameter. The horizontal stem or <b>lever</b> <b>supporting</b> it was of shell-lac, according to Coulomb's direction, the arm carrying the ball being 2.4 inches long, and the other only 1.2 inches: to this was attached the vane, also described by Coulomb, which I found to answer admirably its purpose of quickly destroying vibrations. That the inductive action within the electrometer might be uniform in all positions of the repelled ball and in all states of the apparatus, two bands of tin foil, about an inch wide each, were attached to the inner surface of the glass cylinder, going entirely round it, at the distance of 0.4 of an inch from each other, and at such a height that the intermediate clear surface {{was in the same}} horizontal plane with the lever and ball. These bands were connected {{with each other and with}} the earth, and, being perfect conductors, always exerted a uniform influence on the electrified balls within, which the glass surface, from its irregularity of condition at different times, I found, did not. For the purpose of keeping the air within the electrometer in a constant state as to dryness, a glass dish, of such size as to enter easily within the cylinder, had a layer of fused potash placed within it, and this being covered with a disc of fine wire-gauze to render its inductive action uniform at all parts, was placed within the instrument at the bottom and left there.|$|R
