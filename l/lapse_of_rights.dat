40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} is to decrease the emergence of specific intellectual property risks within the production process as well as increasing risk management performance of IP by preventing them. In order to achieve this, previous studies regarding the main specific intellectual property risks from industrial companies were analyzed together with their managerial methods as well as the possibility of reducing their emergence. As a result of the research conducted were identified five types of intellectual property risks that have a high potential of emergence in the production process, namely: the risk of production of goods in violation of IP rights; the know-how, production knowledge and trade secret disclosure risk; the technological risk of unprotected utility models; the technological risk of unprotected integrated circuits topographies and finally the risk of product counterfeit. In order to achieve the {{main purpose of}} our investigation, we have proposed new formulas for estimating the specific intellectual property risks identified in the production process. Their purpose was to minimalize the risk’s negative effects on industrial companies and to increase the managerial performance from the intellectual property domain through a new type of management appropriately named: intellectual property management. The research is finalized with a case study regarding the <b>lapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> of a patented invention. Based on a case analysis, it was proved that the exploitation of an invention without a contract represents a counterfeit...|$|E

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to acts of {{corporations}} as the main factor in the <b>lapse</b> <b>of</b> the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> participation in corporations. In recent years corporate relations in general were the object of scrutiny. The main discussion was expanded {{in the field of}} explanations of their nature and place in the system of civil law. The priority was the concept of special and not contractual nature of corporate relations. The result of developed dispute was large-scale changes in the legislation of the Russian Federation on legal entities. The changes affected not only the Civil code of the Russian Federation (hereinafter- the CC), but the Federal law of 08. 02. 1998 No. 14 -FL “On limited liability companies", the Federal law dated 26. 12. 1995 No. 208 -FL "On joint stock companies". The <b>lapse</b> <b>of</b> the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> participation is associated primarily with the disappearance of one of the parties of the membership relationship. It is either a liquidation of the corporation, the output of member of the corporation, or conclusion of disposing civil transactions. Liquidation is considered as a corporate procedure, resulting in the termination of a legal entity. Liquidation is considered as a corporate procedure, resulting in the <b>lapse</b> <b>of</b> a legal entity. The output of member of the economic society is carried out {{on the basis of his}} act. Thus, such an act would be in itself a ground for <b>lapse</b> <b>of</b> the participation <b>rights</b> as since its implementation the legal status of the participant is lapsed. Participation right is lapsed by one partner and begins with another. For a business entity any effect does not occur, because the identity of a particular participan...|$|R

40|$|In August of 2005, {{fishing in}} the Bering Sea and Aleutian Island crab {{fisheries}} began under a new sharebased management program (the “program”). The program is unique in several ways, including the allocation of processing shares corresponding to {{a portion of the}} harvest share pool. These processor shares were allocated to processors based on their respective processing histories. To protect community interests, holders of most processor shares were required to enter agreements granting community designated entities a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> first refusal on certain transfers of those shares. Since implementation, community representatives and fishery participants have suggested that some aspects <b>of</b> the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> first refusal may inhibit their effectiveness in protecting community interests. This amendment package considers actions intended to address the following five concerns: 1) the {{relatively short period of time}} allowed for exercising and performing under the right; 2) the <b>lapse</b> <b>of</b> the <b>right</b> after three consecutive years of use of the individual processing quota (IPQ) outside the community or if a community entity elects not to exercise the right on a transaction to which it applies; 3) the requirement that the right apply to all assets involved in a transaction, which could include assets outside the community...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Attentional {{processes}} in children {{play a critical}} role in daily school demands and accomplishments. Studies on the association of attentional processes with school achievement and age in healthy school children are scarce. The aim of the present study was to identify correlations between dimensions of attentional performance, scholastic achievement and age. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: An extensive testing battery was used to assess a wide range of attentional dimensions. A principal component analysis revealed three factors that are related to attentional performance (distractibility, <b>lapses</b> <b>of</b> attention, cognitive speed). Age was negatively associated with distractibility, <b>lapses</b> <b>of</b> attention and cognitive speed, indicating that distractibility and <b>lapses</b> <b>of</b> attention decreased with age in healthy children and resulted in lower cognitive speed. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Attentional {{processes in}} healthy children should be measured in relation to distractibility, <b>lapses</b> <b>of</b> attention and cognitive speed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In many high-risk occupations, it is {{critical}} that a person remains alert at all times. There is much to be gained by being able to monitor a person on-line and detect <b>lapses</b> <b>of</b> consciousness (LoC) so that remedial action can be taken (e. g., a rest break) to ensure that safety is maintained. In this study, 15 normal subjects were observed on two sessions while they performed a continuous tracking task for a period of 1 hour. EEG, eye movements, tracking performance data and a video of the subject were recorded during the session. This paper presents some preliminary results on the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>lapsing.</b> Only 4 <b>of</b> the 15 subjects did not have a LoC at some stage. Seven subjects had LoCs more than 45 times and 4 more than 100 times during the 2 hours. The mean rate <b>of</b> <b>lapsing</b> over all subjects was 29. 1 LoC/h. In contrast, lapses in performance were caused by both <b>lapses</b> <b>of</b> consciousness (30. 1 %) and attention (69. 9 %). There was no correlation found between age of subject and number <b>of</b> <b>lapses</b> <b>of</b> consciousness. Keywords—Alertness, <b>lapses</b> <b>of</b> consciousness, visuomotor tracking...|$|R
