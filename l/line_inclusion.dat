40|$|AbstractWe derive closed-form {{solutions}} to the mixed boundary value problem of a partially debonded rigid <b>line</b> <b>inclusion</b> penetrating a circular elastic inhomogeneity under antiplane shear deformation. The two tips of the rigid <b>line</b> <b>inclusion</b> are just mutual mirror images {{with respect to the}} inhomogeneity/matrix interface, and {{the upper part of the}} rigid <b>line</b> <b>inclusion</b> is debonded from the surrounding materials. By using conformal mapping and the method of image, closed-form solutions are derived for three loading cases: (i) the matrix is subjected to remote uniform stresses; (ii) the matrix is subjected to a line force and a screw dislocation; and (iii) the inhomogeneity is subjected to a line force and a screw dislocation. In the mapped ξ-plane, the solutions for all the three loading cases are interpreted in terms of image singularities. For the remote loading case, explicit full-field expressions of all the field variables such as displacement, stress function and stresses are obtained. Also derived is the near tip asymptotic elastic field governed by two generalized stress intensity factors. The generalized stress intensity factors for all the three loading cases are derived...|$|E

40|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} {{technology is}} widely used in most oil-water wells to improve production. However, the mechanism of fracturing in a reservoir with inclusion fissures is still unclear. In this study, a theoretical model was developed to determine the stress distribution during hydraulic fracturing. The <b>line</b> <b>inclusion</b> fissure {{was regarded as a}} thin bar and the stress around the artificial fracture, which is affected by a single <b>line</b> <b>inclusion,</b> was determined using the Eshelby equivalent inclusion theory. Stress intensity factors at the tip of both the artificial fracture and the inclusion were achieved, and initiation of the fracture was predicted. Furthermore, to validate the theoretical model, re-fracturing experiments were performed on a large-scale tri-axial system. The results showed that the defects reduce the intensity of the rock, which introduces the possibility that more complex fractures emerge in the reservoir. The results also showed that the fracture direction is governed by far-field stress.

There is a need to identify specific tissue markers which can be applied in routine histopathological practice. AIM: To examine the clinical potential of a monoclonal antibody, LhS 28, which reacts with basal bodies of ciliated epithelial cells. METHODS: A panel of normal and pathological gynaecological tissues was processed and labelled with LhS 28. RESULTS: LhS 28 immunoreactivity was found in the normal Fallopian tube where it was confined to ciliated rather than secretory epithelial cells. In the remaining specimens, LhS 28 was associated exclusively with ciliated cells in tubal metaplasias of the cervix and endometrium and in benign serous <b>lined</b> <b>inclusion</b> cysts.

40|$|Autologous serum {{antibodies}} to molecules that are aberrantly expressed in tumors represent potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of cancer. In this study, we identified the homeobox gene HOXA 7 as encoding an antigen in epithelial {{tumors of the}} ovary. These tumors are thought to arise from the simple epithelium lining the ovarian surface, but they often resemble the specialized epithelia derived from the müllerian ducts. Expression of HOXA 7 was detected in ovarian tumors exhibiting müllerian-like features and correlated with the generation of anti-HOXA 7 antibodies by patients. In contrast, {{it was observed that}} healthy women lack anti-HOXA 7 antibodies (P < 0. 0001) and that HOXA 7 expression is absent from normal ovarian surface epithelium.

It is assumed that the bonding between dissimilar elastic materials is weak so that the interface is a preferential path for the crack. The perturbation analysis is made possible {{by means of the}} fundamental solutions (symmetric and skew-symmetric weight functions) derived in Piccolroaz et al. (2009). We derive the dipole matrices of the defects in question and use the corresponding dipole fields to evaluate “effective” tractions along the crack faces and interface to describe the interaction between the main interfacial crack and the defects. For a stable propagation of the crack, the perturbation of the stress intensity factor induced by the defects is then balanced by the elongation of the crack along the interface, thus giving an explicit asymptotic formula for the calculation of the crack advance. The method is general and applicable to interfacial cracks with general distributed loading on the crack faces, taking into account possible asymmetry in the boundary conditions. The analytical results are used to analyse the shielding and amplification effects of various types of defects in different configurations.
