Halcrow Group, the engineering consultancy, were responsible for carrying out the assessment, which <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> benefits that each route might provide, not only for navigation but also for water quality, water resources and habitat for wildlife. The study was expected to provide a short-list of routes, which would then be the subject of further consultation.|$|E

40|$|This thesis <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> discord between {{asymmetric}} warfare and just war theory. Specifically, it <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> place of just war theory in political science, and the competing theories that analyse war. Consequently, it <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> specific problems that face just war theory in an {{asymmetric warfare}} context, by <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> three parts of just war theory. The first is jus ad bellum, {{the justice of}} war, and <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{decision to go to}} war. The second is jus in bello, the justice in war, and <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> conduct of war. The final is jus post bellum, and <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> conclusion of war. By the end of this thesis, I aim to have provided a basis for reconciling asymmetric warfare and just war theory. Department of Government and International Relation...|$|R

As {{the head of the}} University of Toronto's political economy department, he worked to build up a cadre of Canadian scholars so that universities would not continue to rely as heavily on British or American-trained professors unfamiliar with Canada's history and culture. He was successful in establishing sources of financing for Canadian scholarly research.|$|E

5|$|Rutherford gave Chadwick a {{part-time}} teaching position at Manchester, {{allowing him to}} continue research. He <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> nuclear charge of platinum, silver, and copper, and experimentally found {{that this was the}} same as the atomic number within an error of less than 1.5 per cent. In April 1919, Rutherford became director of the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, and Chadwick joined him there a few months later. Chadwick was awarded a Clerk-Maxwell studentship in 1920, and enrolled as a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) student at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. The first half of his thesis was his work with atomic numbers. In the second, he <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> forces inside the nucleus. His degree was awarded in June 1921. In November, he became a Fellow of Gonville and Caius College.|$|E

5|$|Burnet's work on graft-versus-host was in {{collaboration}} with Lone Simonsen between 1960 and 1962. Simonsen had shown in 1957 that when a chick embryo was inoculated intravenously with adult-fowl blood, a graft-versus-host reaction occurred; this {{was known as the}} Simonsen phenomenon. Their work in this system would later help to explain passenger leukocytes in transplantation. The last project he worked on at the Institute was a study with assistant Margaret Holmes of autoimmune disease in the New Zealand black mouse model; this mouse has a high incidence of spontaneous autoimmune hemolytic anemia. They <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> inheritance of autoimmune disease, and their use of immunosuppressive drug cyclophosphamide to treat the disease influenced the use of immunosuppressive drugs in human autoimmune disease.|$|E
5|$|Even Born was {{surprised}} to discover that Paul Dirac had been thinking along the same lines as Heisenberg. Soon Wolfgang Pauli used the matrix method to calculate the energy values of the hydrogen atom, and found that they agreed with the Bohr model. Another important contribution was made by Erwin Schrödinger, who <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> problem using wave mechanics. This {{had a great deal of}} appeal to many at the time, as it offered the possibility of returning to deterministic classical physics. Born would have none of this, as it ran counter to facts determined by experiment. He formulated the now-standard interpretation of the probability density function for ψ*ψ in the Schrödinger equation, which he published in July 1926.|$|E

Wall <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> increasing complexity of games {{as an opportunity to}} give players a soundtrack with as much force as a movie score, and tried to create a distinctive sound that was still recognizable as Myst music. In Revelation, Wall adapted the themes for the recurring characters of Myst, and collaborated with Peter Gabriel, who provided a song to the game as well as voicework.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Letlive {{began writing}} on the third album. Butler said that their writing {{approach}} changed in comparison to their previous releases, as they were now doing most of it while on tour. During pre-production, the band listened to styles and ideas that, according to Butler, changed the way they <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> songs they had initially written. The styles were their most expansive to date, and came from the diversity of their members: Butler had involved himself in the punk rock skateboarding culture when he was eleven, but had also been influenced by his father, {{who was in a}} soul band.|$|E
5|$|In a {{situation}} analogous {{with that of}} other European countries, the progressive internal decay of the Polish Church created conditions favorable for the dissemination of the Reformation ideas and currents. For example, there was a chasm between the lower clergy and the nobility-based Church hierarchy, which was quite laicized and preoccupied with temporal issues, such as power and wealth, and often corrupt. The middle nobility, which had already {{been exposed to the}} Hussite reformist persuasion, increasingly <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Church's many privileges with envy and hostility.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Barry Cunliffe decided {{to examine a}} single hill fort and its {{surrounding}} territory {{in an attempt to}} shed light on Iron Age society, its politics, and population. With the permission of the site's owner, Hampshire County Council, archaeological excavations began in 1969 and continued until 1988. Over the twentyseasons archaeologists spent examining the site, they <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> defences and the gateway, and excavated 57% of the interior, where the remains of wattle and timber houses were discovered. It was the lengthiest investigation of any hill fort in western Europe.|$|E

In 1960, Morgan {{was a member of}} a committee that <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> toxicity of pesticides used in agriculture.

5|$|The inquiry was {{launched}} on 31 May 2001, and was {{split into two}} phases: phase one and phase two. Phase one investigated the involvement of people and agencies in Climbié's death, {{in the form of}} hearings. Two hundred and seventy witnesses were involved. The phase one hearings began on 26 September 2001 and finished on 31 July 2002; it was originally supposed to end on 4 February 2002 but late documents caused delays. Phase two of the inquiry, taking place between 15 March 2002 and 26 April 2002, took the form of five seminars, which <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> child protection system in general.

5|$|The {{presence}} of outsiders {{such as the}} Strangers and the Particulars was a considerable annoyance to the Pilgrims.

Furthermore, a group of Strangers founded the nearby settlement of Wessagussett and the Pilgrims were highly strained, both emotionally {{and in terms of}} resources, by their lack of discipline.

5|$|A {{study by}} Sanchez and Wiley showed that seductive details caused poor {{learning}} outcomes because they take {{up some of}} the limited space in working memory. The experiment compared people's ability to control their attention to scientific text that contained either seductive images, relevant images, or no images. The study showed that people with low working memory capacity were especially vulnerable to the seductive details effect. Sanchez and Wiley also did an experiment where eye-tracking was monitored to evaluate how people were reading the same seductively illustrated scientific text. The results showed that people with low working memory <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> seductive illustrations more often and for longer than those with high working memory capacity. It could be argued that differences in performance between high- and low- working memory capacity individuals is really due to general reading ability, an attribute that has been correlated with working memory capacity in other studies.|$|E
