It is shown that together with the band states of Frenkel excitons in the molecular chain the contribution to light absorption and luminescence comes from local levels that split off from the exciton band {{as a result of}} the interaction between the molecular chain and the luminophore. It is also demonstrated that the contribution to light absorption and photoluminescence from local levels is non-linearly dependent on the coupling parameter between the luminophore and the J-aggregate molecular chain.

40|$|Quantum {{interference}} (QI) in molecular transport junctions {{can lead}} to dramatic reductions of the electron transmission at certain energies. In a recent work [Markussen et al., Nano Lett. 2010, 10, 4260] we showed how the presence of such transmission nodes near the Fermi energy can be predicted solely from {{the structure of a}} conjugated molecule when the energies of the atomic p_z orbitals do not vary too much. Here we relax the assumption of equal on-site energies and generalize the graphical scheme to molecules containing different atomic species. We use this diagrammatic scheme together with tight-binding and density functional theory calculations to investigate QI in <b>linear</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>chains</b> and aromatic molecules with different side groups. For the <b>molecular</b> <b>chains</b> we find a linear relation between the position of the transmission nodes and the side group pi orbital energy. In contrast, the transmission functions of functionalized aromatic molecules generally display a rather complex nodal structure due to the interplay between molecular topology and the energy of the side group orbital.

40|$|Navier-Stokes-Fourier hydrodynamics {{breaks down}} {{on the order of}} {{molecular}} length and time scales. Once the confinement approaches molecular dimensions, classical theory must be generalized to allow for local position dependent coefficients. It has been recently shown that for flow fields with high gradients in the strain rate over the with of the r-space kernels nonlocality plays a significant role [1]. We present an extended analysis of the exact homogeneous nonlocal viscosity kernels [2] for simple <b>linear</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>chains</b> at a variety of state points and chain lengths. This allows using nonlocal generalization of the linear constitutive relation with appropriate boundary conditions to predict the flow profiles for highly confined molecular fluids. We compute the k-space and r-space kernels calculated from the stress autocorrelation functions and the transverse momentum density autocorrelation functions in atomic and molecular hydrodynamic representation. Functional forms have been found to fit the kernel data over a large density range and k-vectors and a comparative analysis of fitting is presented. The results show that the kernels have a width of a few molecular diameters which means that the generalized hydrodynamic viscosity must be used in predicting the flow properties of fluids on length scales where the gradient in the strain rate is of the order of molecular dimensions (eg in nanofluidics) ...|$|R

40|$|Functionalization {{of carbon}} {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) with <b>linear</b> <b>molecular</b> side <b>chains</b> of polyphenylene ether (PPE) {{has been shown}} to be effective in solubilizing the CNTs in the solvent components of solutions that are cast to make epoxy/CNT composite films. (In the absence of solubilization, the CNTs tend to clump together instead of becoming dispersed in solution as needed to impart, to the films, the desired CNT properties of electrical conductivity and mechanical strength.) Because the PPE functionalizes the CNTs in a noncovalent manner, the functionalization does not damage the CNTs. The functionalization can also be exploited to improve the interactions between CNTs and epoxy matrices to enhance the properties of the resulting composite films. In addition to the CNTs, solvent, epoxy resin, epoxy hardener, and PPE, a properly formulated solution also includes a small amount of polycarbonate, which serves to fill voids that, if allowed to remain, would degrade the performance of the film. To form the film, the solution is drop-cast or spin-cast, then the solvent is allowed to evaporate...|$|R

Its performance is tested on the ionization potential and the energy gap between singlet ground state and lowest triplet for <b>linear</b> <b>molecular</b> hydrogen <b>chains</b> and more realistic systems, such as polyenes and polysilenes, using full configuration interaction (FCI) wave functions with a minimal basis set. The influence of different block sizes and the extent of interblock interactions are investigated. It has been demonstrated that satisfactory results can be obtained if the near degeneracies between the model space and the outer space are avoided and if interactions between the next-nearest neighbor blocks are considered. The method can be used with larger basis sets and other accurate enough ab initio evaluations (instead of FCI) of local excited states, from blocks, or from dimers or trimers of blocks. It provides a new possibility to accurately and economically describe the low-lying delocalized excited states of large systems, even inhomogeneous ones...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} results of a {{theoretical}} analysis of a completely general linear chain model for transduction in photoreceptors from which we have derived a statistical test for the intrinsic linearity of the single-photon transduction process. By linearity we mean comprising first-order chemical reactions only. We show results of our own measurements in Limulus ventral photoreceptors that pass this linearity test, suggesting that the single-photon transduction in Limulus may be a simple chain of first-order biochemical reactions (plus possible diffusional processes). However, we also demonstrate that published data show the existence of strong nonlinearities in the single-photon responses of toad and perhaps also of locust. Such nonlinearities are not difficult to construct from existing biochemical notions (feedback, cooperativity), but all but one [Kramer, L. (1975) Biophys. Struct.

The nonequilibrium stationary state is obtained as an eigenstate of the Liouvillian which is constructed through the collision invariant of the kinetic equation. The eigenstate of the Liouvillian contains an information of spatial correlation between the <b>molecular</b> <b>chain</b> and the thermal baths.

30|$|In addition, the {{fluctuation}} of {{the linear}} polymer is less severe {{than that of the}} polymer–surfactant and HAHPAM. The reason for the fluctuations in the polymer–surfactant and HAHPAM is as follows. Due to crosslinking forces between the <b>molecular</b> <b>chains</b> combined with the aggregation forces of hydrophobic groupings for the polymer–surfactant and HAHPAM, the two polymer solutions form a “regional” three-dimensional structure of polymer molecular aggregations, showing more heterogeneous characteristics than the linear polymer solution. Therefore, the frequency sweep results of the HAHPAM and polymer–surfactant present more fluctuations than the linear polymer solution. In addition, we conducted TEM analyses of the three polymer solutions to study the internal structure. From the TEM results, we can see that the three polymers present different <b>molecular</b> structures. The <b>linear</b> polymer shows the long-chain structure and the electrostatic repulsion between intermolecular chains is strong, and thus the <b>molecular</b> <b>chain</b> conformation is stretching. For the HAHPAM solution, the <b>molecular</b> <b>chains</b> of the polymers can cross one another, forming a random network structure. For the polymer–surfactant solution, there are coarse trunks and fine branches in the solution, and {{it appears to be a}} “slice-network” structure because the <b>molecular</b> <b>chain</b> combines short side chains with polar groups, and the active groups are grafted. Therefore, the extension ability of the primary chain is improved (Fig.  9).|$|R
