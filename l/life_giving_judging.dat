5000|$|In Judaism and Samaritanism, it is {{believed}} that Yehowah, the God of Israel, will one day give [...] "Teḥiyyat Ha-Metim" [...] or [...] "life to the dead", to the righteous. Judaists base this belief on the prophecies regarding the event in the Tanakh: the books of Yeshayahu, Yeḥez'qel, and Dani'el. Samaritans base it solely on a passage called the Ha'azeinu in the Torah, since they only accept the Torah and reject the rest of the Hebrew Bible. Judaists believe that both the righteous and the wicked who are deceased of this world will be <b>given</b> <b>life</b> and <b>judged.</b> They believe the righteous of Israel and the Noahide laws, of the righteous among the gentiles, will have eternal life on earth, while the wicked will be punished and executed. Samaritans believe that only the righteous of Israel will be resurrected and <b>given</b> eternal <b>life</b> on earth.|$|R
