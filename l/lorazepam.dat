5|$|A 1990 study {{claimed that}} {{diazepam}} {{has a higher}} misuse potential relative to other benzodiazepines, and that some data suggests that alprazolam and <b>lorazepam</b> resemble diazepam in this respect.|$|E
5|$|Administration of alprazolam, as {{compared}} to <b>lorazepam,</b> has been demonstrated to elicit a statistically significant increase in extracellular dopamine D1 and D2 concentrations in the striatum.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are usually}} {{administered}} orally; however, very occasionally <b>lorazepam</b> or diazepam {{may be given}} intravenously {{for the treatment of}} panic attacks.|$|E
5|$|Prolonged convulsive epileptic {{seizures}} are {{a medical}} emergency that {{can usually be}} dealt with effectively by administering fast-acting benzodiazepines, which are potent anticonvulsants. In a hospital environment, intravenous clonazepam, <b>lorazepam,</b> and diazepam are first-line choices, clonazepam due to its stronger and more potent anticonvulsant action, diazepam due to its faster onset and <b>lorazepam</b> for its longer duration of action. In the community, intravenous administration is not practical and so rectal diazepam or (more recently) buccal midazolam are used, with a preference for midazolam as its administration is easier and more socially acceptable.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{effective}} as medication given {{a couple of}} hours before surgery to relieve anxiety. They also produce amnesia, which can be useful, as patients may not remember unpleasantness from the procedure. They are also used in patients with dental phobia as well as some ophthalmic procedures like refractive surgery; although such use is controversial and only recommended for those who are very anxious. Midazolam is the most commonly prescribed for this use because of its strong sedative actions and fast recovery time, as well as its water solubility, which reduces pain upon injection. Diazepam and <b>lorazepam</b> are sometimes used. <b>Lorazepam</b> has particularly marked amnesic properties that may make it more effective when amnesia is the desired effect.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines are the {{preferred}} {{choice in the}} management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, in particular, for the prevention and treatment of the dangerous complication of seizures and in subduing severe delirium. <b>Lorazepam</b> is the only benzodiazepine with predictable intramuscular absorption and it is the most effective in preventing and controlling acute seizures.|$|E
5|$|Intermediate-acting {{compounds}} have {{a median}} half-life of 12–40 hours. They {{may have some}} residual effects {{in the first half}} of the day if used as a hypnotic. Rebound insomnia, however, is more common upon discontinuation of intermediate-acting benzodiazepines than longer-acting benzodiazepines. Examples are alprazolam, estazolam, flunitrazepam, clonazepam, lormetazepam, <b>lorazepam,</b> nitrazepam, and temazepam.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of death, Jackson had been {{administered}} propofol, <b>lorazepam,</b> and midazolam, and the Los Angeles coroner decided to treat the death as a homicide. Law enforcement officials conducted a manslaughter investigation of his personal physician Conrad Murray, and charged him with involuntary manslaughter in Los Angeles on February 8, 2010. Jackson's body was entombed on September 3, 2009, at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.|$|E
5|$|Individual benzodiazepines {{may have}} {{different}} interactions with certain drugs. Depending on their metabolism pathway, benzodiazepines can be divided roughly into two groups. The largest group consists of those that are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes and possess significant potential for interactions with other drugs. The other group comprises those that are metabolized through glucuronidation, such as <b>lorazepam,</b> oxazepam, and temazepam, and, in general, have few drug interactions.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} prescribed and misused benzodiazepines in the United States. A large-scale nationwide U.S. government study conducted by SAMHSA found that, in the U.S., benzodiazepines are recreationally the most frequently used pharmaceuticals due to their widespread availability, accounting for 35% of all drug-related visits to hospital emergency and urgent care facilities. Men and women are equally likely to use benzodiazepines recreationally. The report found that alprazolam is the most common benzodiazepine for recreational use, followed by clonazepam, <b>lorazepam,</b> and diazepam. The number of emergency room visits due to benzodiazepines increased by 36% between 2004 and 2006.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, Canadian Psychiatric Association (CPA) {{recommends}} benzodiazepines alprazolam, bromazepam, <b>lorazepam,</b> and diazepam {{only as a}} second-line choice, if {{the treatment}} with two different antidepressants was unsuccessful. Although they are second-line agents, benzodiazepines {{can be used for}} a limited time to relieve severe anxiety and agitation. CPA guidelines note that after 4–6 weeks the effect of benzodiazepines may decrease to the level of placebo, and that benzodiazepines are less effective than antidepressants in alleviating ruminative worry, the core symptom of GAD. However, in some cases, a prolonged treatment with benzodiazepines as the add-on to an antidepressant may be justified.|$|E
5|$|The benzodiazepines {{diazepam}} (Valium) and oxazepam (Serepax) {{have been}} found to produce fewer withdrawal reactions than alprazolam (Xanax), temazepam (Restoril/Normison), or <b>lorazepam</b> (Temesta/Ativan). Factors that determine the risk of psychological dependence or physical dependence and the severity of the benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms during dose reduction of alprazolam include: dosage used, length of use, frequency of dosing, personality characteristics of the individual, previous use of cross-dependent/cross-tolerant drugs (alcohol or other sedative-hypnotic drugs), current use of cross-dependent/-tolerant drugs, use of other short-acting, high-potency benzodiazepines, and method of discontinuation.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are also}} used to treat the acute panic caused by {{hallucinogen}} intoxication. Benzodiazepines {{are also used}} to calm the acutely agitated individual and can, if required, be given via an intramuscular injection. They can sometimes be effective in the short-term treatment of psychiatric emergencies such as acute psychosis as in schizophrenia or mania, bringing about rapid tranquillization and sedation until the effects of lithium or neuroleptics (antipsychotics) take effect. <b>Lorazepam</b> is most commonly used but clonazepam is sometimes prescribed for acute psychosis or mania; their long-term use is not recommended due to risks of dependence. Further research investigating the use of benzodiazepines alone and in combination with antipsychotic medications for treating acute psychosis is warranted.|$|E
5|$|Chlordiazepoxide is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used benzodiazepine for alcohol detoxification, but diazepam may be used as an alternative. Both are used in the detoxification of individuals who are motivated to stop drinking, and are prescribed {{for a short period of}} time to reduce the risks of developing tolerance and dependence to the benzodiazepine medication itself. The benzodiazepines with a longer half-life make detoxification more tolerable, and dangerous (and potentially lethal) alcohol withdrawal effects are less likely to occur. On the other hand, short-acting benzodiazepines may lead to breakthrough seizures, and are, therefore, not recommended for detoxification in an outpatient setting. Oxazepam and <b>lorazepam</b> are often used in patients at risk of drug accumulation, in particular, the elderly and those with cirrhosis, because they are metabolized differently from other benzodiazepines, through conjugation.|$|E
5|$|If {{a seizure}} lasts longer than 5minutes {{or if there}} are more than two {{seizures}} in an hour without a return to a normal level of consciousness between them, it is considered a medical emergency known as status epilepticus. This may require medical help to keep the airway open and protected; a nasopharyngeal airway may be useful for this. At home the recommended initial medication for seizure of a long duration is midazolam placed in the mouth. Diazepam may also be used rectally. In hospital, intravenous <b>lorazepam</b> is preferred. If two doses of benzodiazepines are not effective, other medications such as phenytoin are recommended. Convulsive status epilepticus that does not respond to initial treatment typically requires admission to the intensive care unit and treatment with stronger agents such as thiopentone or propofol.|$|E
5|$|Intravenous {{midazolam}} {{is indicated}} for procedural sedation (often {{in combination with}} an opioid, such as fentanyl), for preoperative sedation, for the induction of general anesthesia, and for sedation {{of people who are}} ventilated in critical care units. Midazolam is superior to diazepam in impairing memory of endoscopy procedures, but propofol has a quicker recovery time and a better memory-impairing effect. It is the most popular benzodiazepine {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU) because of its short elimination half-life, combined with its water solubility and its suitability for continuous infusion. However, for long-term sedation, <b>lorazepam</b> is preferred due to its long duration of action, and propofol has advantages over midazolam when used in the ICU for sedation, such as shorter weaning time and earlier tracheal extubation.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam {{is among}} about 35 benzodiazepines {{currently}} used medically, and was synthesised in 1975 by Walser and Fryer at Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc in the United States. Owing to its water solubility, {{it was found}} to be less likely to cause thrombophlebitis than similar drugs. The anticonvulsant properties of midazolam were studied in the late 1970s, but not until the 1990s did it emerge as an effective treatment for convulsive status epilepticus. , it is the most commonly used benzodiazepine in anesthetic medicine. In acute medicine, midazolam has become more popular than other benzodiazepines, such as <b>lorazepam</b> and diazepam, because it is shorter lasting, is more potent, and causes less pain at the injection site. Midazolam is also becoming increasingly popular in veterinary medicine due to its water solubility.|$|E
5|$|There is no antidote, and {{supportive}} care is {{the mainstay of}} further treatment for intoxication. Though {{sometimes referred to as}} a deliriant and while muscarine was first isolated from A. muscaria and as such is its namesake, muscimol does not have action, either as an agonist or antagonist, at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor site, and therefore atropine or physostigmine as an antidote is not recommended. If a patient is delirious or agitated, this can usually be treated by reassurance and, if necessary, physical restraints. A benzodiazepine such as diazepam or <b>lorazepam</b> can be used to control combativeness, agitation, muscular overactivity, and seizures. Only small doses should be used, as they may worsen the respiratory depressant effects of muscimol. Recurrent vomiting is rare, but if present may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances; intravenous rehydration or electrolyte replacement may be required. Serious cases may develop loss of consciousness or coma, and may need intubation and artificial ventilation. Hemodialysis can remove the toxins, although this intervention is generally considered unnecessary. With modern medical treatment the prognosis is typically good following supportive treatment.|$|E
25|$|Ativan (<b>lorazepam)</b> for {{anxiety and}} panic disorders.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} {{hydroxyzine}} {{has also been}} tested {{on the ability of}} humans in the registration and storage of memory, and was used in comparison with relatively safe drugs, such as <b>lorazepam,</b> to illustrate the effects of benzodiazepines, which are thought to have adverse effects on the capacity of memory storage. Hydroxyzine was found to have no adverse effects on memory in relation to <b>lorazepam,</b> which caused several deficiencies in the capacity of memory storage.|$|E
25|$|Intravenous {{diazepam}} or <b>lorazepam</b> are first-line {{treatments for}} status epilepticus. However, intravenous <b>lorazepam</b> has advantages over intravenous diazepam, including {{a higher rate}} of terminating seizures and a more prolonged anticonvulsant effect. Diazepam gel was better than placebo gel in reducing the risk of non-cessation of seizures. Diazepam is rarely used for the long-term treatment of epilepsy because tolerance to its anticonvulsant effects usually develops within six to 12 months of treatment, effectively rendering it useless for that purpose.|$|E
25|$|The {{benzodiazepine}} {{of choice}} in North America for initial treatment is <b>lorazepam</b> due to its relatively long duration of action (2–8 hours) when injected, and its rapid onset of action, which {{is thought to be}} due to its high affinity for GABA receptors and to its low lipid solubility, which causes it to remain in the vascular compartment. If <b>lorazepam</b> is not available, or intravenous access is not possible, then diazepam should be given. In several countries outside North America, intravenous clonazepam is regarded as the drug of first choice. For instance a guideline from the Netherlands recommends clonazepam. Cited advantages of clonazepam include a longer duration of action than diazepam and a lower propensity for the development of acute tolerance than <b>lorazepam.</b> The use of clonazepam for this indication has not caught on in North America, as it is not available as an intravenous formulation there.|$|E
25|$|When given intravenously, <b>lorazepam</b> {{appears to}} be {{superior}} to diazepam for stopping seizure activity. Intramuscular midazolam {{appears to be}} a reasonable option especially in those who are not in hospital.|$|E
25|$|Abuse of {{benzodiazepine}} {{drugs is}} a serious problem in North America. The most frequently abused of the benzodiazepines in both the United States and Canada are alprazolam, clonazepam, <b>lorazepam</b> and diazepam.|$|E
25|$|In a 2017 publication, an {{analysis}} of the blood samples of 22 victims of drug-facilitated robberies in Bangladesh revealed that criminals use different mixtures of Benzodiazepines including <b>Lorazepam,</b> Midazolam, Diazepam and Nordiazepam to immobilize and then rob their victims.|$|E
25|$|Delirium tremens due {{to alcohol}} {{withdrawal}} {{can be treated}} with benzodiazepines. High doses {{may be necessary to}} prevent death. Amounts given are based on the symptoms. Typically the person is kept sedated with benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, <b>lorazepam,</b> chlordiazepoxide, or oxazepam.|$|E
25|$|Particularly in children, {{another popular}} {{treatment}} choice is midazolam, given {{into the side}} of the mouth or the nose. Sometimes, the failure of <b>lorazepam</b> alone is considered to be enough to classify a case of SE as resistant to treatment.|$|E
25|$|Convulsions from GHB can {{be treated}} with the benzodiazepines {{diazepam}} or <b>lorazepam.</b> Even though these benzodiazepines are also CNS depressants, they are GABAA agonists whereas GHB is primarily a GABAB agonist, and so do not worsen CNS depression as much as might be expected.|$|E
25|$|Sedative {{drugs are}} often {{prescribed}} for vertigo and dizziness, but these usually treat the symptoms {{rather than the}} underlying cause. <b>Lorazepam</b> (Ativan) is often used and is a sedative which {{has no effect on}} the disease process, but rather helps patients cope with the sensation.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines {{are one of}} {{the largest}} classes of abused drugs; they are classed as {{schedule}} IV controlled drugs because of their recognized medical uses. Across the world the most frequently diverted and abused benzodiazepines include temazepam, diazepam, nimetazepam, nitrazepam, triazolam, flunitrazepam, midazolam, and in the United States alprazolam, clonazepam, and <b>lorazepam.</b>|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines possess anti-anxiety {{properties}} {{and can be}} useful for the short-term treatment of severe anxiety. Like the anticonvulsants, {{they tend to be}} mild and well tolerated, although there is a risk of habit-forming. Benzodiazepines are usually administered orally for the treatment of anxiety; however, occasionally <b>lorazepam</b> or diazepam may be given intravenously for the treatment of panic attacks.|$|E
25|$|If this proves {{ineffective}} or if barbiturates {{cannot be}} used for some reason, then a general anesthetic such as propofol may be tried; sometimes it is used second after the failure of <b>lorazepam.</b> This also means putting the people on artificial ventilation. Propofol {{has been shown to}} be effective in suppressing the jerks seen in myoclonus status epilepticus.|$|E
25|$|In {{tests in}} {{pentobarbital}} trained rhesus monkeys benzodiazepines produced effects similar to barbiturates. In a 1991 study, triazolam {{had the highest}} self-administration rate in cocaine trained baboons, among the five benzodiazepines examined: alprazolam, bromazepam, chlordiazepoxide, <b>lorazepam,</b> triazolam. A 1985 study found that triazolam and temazepam maintained higher rates of self-injection than {{a variety of other}} benzodiazepines. A 1991 study indicated that diazepam, in particular, had a greater abuse liability among people who were drug abusers than did many of the other benzodiazepines. Some of the available data also suggested that <b>lorazepam</b> and alprazolam are more diazepam-like in having relatively high abuse liability, while oxazepam, halazepam, and possibly chlordiazepoxide, are relatively low in this regard. A 1991–1993 British study found that the hypnotics flurazepam and temazepam were more toxic than average benzodiazepines in overdose. A 1995 study found that temazepam is more rapidly absorbed and oxazepam is more slowly absorbed than most other benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|The {{first-line}} {{drugs for}} treatment of status epilepticus are benzodiazepines, such as <b>lorazepam</b> or diazepam. If these fail, then phenytoin may be used, with phenobarbital being an alternative in the US, but used only third-line in the UK. Failing that, the only treatment is anaesthesia in intensive care. The World Health Organization gives phenobarbital a first-line recommendation {{in the developing world}} and it is commonly used there.|$|E
25|$|Like alcohol, benzodiazepines, such as alprazolam, clonazepam, <b>lorazepam</b> and diazepam, are {{commonly}} used to treat insomnia in the short-term (both prescribed and self-medicated), but worsen sleep in the long-term. While benzodiazepines can put people to sleep (i.e., inhibit NREM stage 1 and 2 sleep), while asleep, the drugs disrupt sleep architecture: decreasing sleep time, delaying time to REM sleep, and decreasing deep slow-wave sleep (the most restorative part of sleep for both energy and mood).|$|E
25|$|A 1985 {{study found}} that {{temazepam}} and triazolam maintained significantly higher rates of self-injection than {{a variety of other}} benzodiazepines. The study tested and compared the abuse liability of temazepam, triazolam, diazepam, <b>lorazepam,</b> oxazepam, flurazepam, alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, bromazepam, and clorazepate. The study tested self-injection rates on human, baboon, and rat subjects. All test subjects consistently showed a strong preference for temazepam and triazolam over {{all the rest of the}} benzodiazepines included in the study.|$|E
