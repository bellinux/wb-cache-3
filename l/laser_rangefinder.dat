40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. This thesis analyzes {{the feasibility of}} using new technology such as <b>laser</b> <b>rangefinders</b> to enhance ship stationkeeping during Underway Replenishment (UNREP) Operations. The introduction of new technology is the single best method to reduce manpower requirements on board Navy vessels today. UNREP at sea is the most manning intensive evolution required by the Navy for Commanders and sailors to execute. This research explores new methods to communicate and determine approach and alongside ranges between ships at sea. Research was conducted on five classes of combatants using <b>laser</b> <b>rangefinders.</b> <b>Laser</b> <b>rangefinders</b> {{were found to be}} the only mature, suitable technology to replace the Phone and Distance line legacy system. An analysis of alternatives based upon cost estimates and observed benefits revealed that using lasers could provide enhanced situational awareness to ship Commanders, Officers of the Deck and Conning officers. A modest investment in <b>laser</b> <b>rangefinders</b> for each ship in conjunction with billboard range displays on replenishment ships and reconfigured sound powered phone lines would cost effectively simplify Underway Replenishment evolutions by reducing time alongside, increasing safety to personnel and vessels at sea, and sailors Quality of Life.

25|$|The Virginia {{class is}} the first to utilize {{photonic}} sensors instead of a traditional periscope: the class is equipped with high-resolution cameras, along with light-intensification and infrared sensors, an infrared <b>laser</b> <b>rangefinder,</b> and an integrated Electronic Support Measures (ESM) array. Two redundant sets of these sensors are mounted on two AN/BVS-1 photonics masts located outside the pressure hull. Signals from the masts' sensors are transmitted through optical fiber data lines through signal processors to the control center. Visual feeds from the masts are displayed on liquid-crystal display interfaces in the command center.|$|E
25|$|Even {{within the}} {{development}} stages, a Hawk variant {{was intended to}} {{also serve as a}} single-seat ground-attack fighter; both the trainer and fighter models were developed with the export market in mind. On single seat models, the forward cockpit area which normally houses a pilot is replaced by an electronics bay for avionics and onboard systems, including a fire control computer, multi-mode radar, <b>laser</b> <b>rangefinder</b> and forward-looking infrared (FLIR). Some export customers, such as Malaysia, have extensive modifications to their aircraft, including the addition of wingtip hardpoint stations and a fittable inflight refuelling probe.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In {{order to}} realize the {{automation}} of space control of automobile, an intelligent control system was designed, which consists of a <b>laser</b> <b>rangefinders,</b> a speed sensor, a digital controller and a performing motor. The <b>laser</b> <b>rangefinders</b> were developed for the system. The digital controller adopted PIC 16 F 877 SCM, and a step motor was utilized for the performing. Using fuzzy logic theory, an intelligent control scheme was developed {{to realize the}} automation of space control according to the error for space and speed in the automobile cruise control system. The method needn’t build the accurate mathematic model of object, {{but according to the}} artificial experience or state to build the control rule. It avoids the object’s uncertainty, noise, infection of nonlinearity and variable time. The experimental results show that anticipative aims are achieved on the prototype machine.

40|$|<b>Laser</b> <b>rangefinders,</b> which measure {{distances}} by {{detecting the}} phase shift of intensity modulated laser light reflected by objects, are very useful for obtaining 3 -D {{models of the}} surrounding environment. A drawback of single-frequency <b>laser</b> <b>rangefinders</b> is that the phase measurement is always ambiguous. The consequence of this phase ambiguity is a range ambiguity interval equal to one-half of the wavelength of the modulation signal. Objects outside this interval are not ranged correctly. This thesis describes the theory and implementation of a dual-frequency laser rangefinding {{system in which the}} sum of two sinusoidal signals modulates the laser intensity. The resulting two ambiguous distance measurements are used to calculate the true distance to the target. This method allows a greater ambiguity interval without sacrificing measurement accuracy. The system built at Rice University has performed as expected, verified the algorithms and theories presented, and demonstrated the practicality of dual-frequency <b>laser</b> <b>rangefinders...</b>|$|R

25|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, an {{additional}} 15 aircraft, designated Alpha Jet MS2, were ordered. The Alpha Jet MS2 bore {{high levels of}} similarity to Dassault's proposed Alpha Jet NGEA, featuring a Sagem-built Uliss 81 nav/attack system, a Thomson-CSF-built <b>laser</b> <b>rangefinder</b> and HUD, along with a digital multiplex databus. The Egptian Air Force used the Alpha Jet MS1 fleet to replace the Aero L-29 Delfín and Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 in the trainer role, while the later-built MS2 standard aircraft served to replace the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17 in the ground-attack role. In February 2000, Egypt was reportedly seeking to replace their Alpha Jet fleet, and was investigating several options, including the BAE Systems Hawk.|$|E
25|$|This {{program was}} {{managed by the}} firm Thune-Eureka. The American firm NAPCO {{developed}} an improved power pack based around the 6V53T diesel engine used in the M113 armored personnel carrier mated to an Allison MT-653 transmission. The original 75mm Gun M6 L/39 was replaced with a French D-925 90mm low pressure gun, with a co-axial 0.50-inch (12.7 mm) M2 heavy machine gun. The bow gunner position was eliminated in favor of ammunition stowage. A new fire-control system was installed, complete with a Simrad LV3 <b>laser</b> <b>rangefinder.</b> Norwegian firms also converted eight M24 light tanks into light armored recovery vehicles to support the NM-116. The NM-116 were retired from service in 1993.|$|E
