5|$|The {{different}} styles of Cabernet Sauvignon from different regions can also influence how well the wine matches up with certain foods. Old World wines, such as Bordeaux, have earthier influences and will pair better with mushrooms. Wines from cooler climates that have noticeable vegetal notes can be balanced with vegetables and greens. New World wines, with bolder fruit flavors that may even be perceived as sweet, will pair well with bolder dishes that have <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> flavor influences. While Cabernet Sauvignon {{has the potential to}} pair well with bitter dark chocolate, it will not pair well with sweeter styles such as milk chocolate. The wine can typically pair well with a variety of cheeses, such as Cheddar, mozzarella and Brie, but full flavored or blue cheeses will typically compete too much with the flavors of Cabernet Sauvignon to be a complementary pairing.|$|E

Leaf matter incorporated into sediment is largely deposited during the autumn, so seasonal variations in leaf waxes must be considered accordingly. Furthermore, sediments average leaf waxes over <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> plants in both space and time, making it difficult to calibrate the biological constraints on εl/w. Finally, preservation of biomolecules in the geologic record does not faithfully represent whole ecosystems, and there is always the threat of hydrogen exchange, particularly if the sediments are subjected to high temperatures.|$|E

500|$|The Media Action Network for Asian-Americans (MANAA) {{criticized the}} casting of white actor Mackenzie Davis as Mindy Park who it said was {{described}} by author Andy Weir as Korean-American. The group also criticized the casting of Chiwetel Ejiofor as Vincent Kapoor, who the MANAA said Weir described as an Asian-Indian character. In the novel, the character's name was Venkat Kapoor, and he identifies religiously as a Hindu (a Baptist and a Hindu in the film). The group called the casting whitewashing and said that Asian actors, being under-represented in Hollywood, were deprived of acting opportunities. Weir said in October 2015 he perceived Mindy Park as Korean but {{said he did not}} explicitly write her as Korean. He also dismissed criticism of Ejiofor's casting as Kapoor, [...] "He's an American. Americans come from <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> sources. You can be Venkat Kapoor and black."

500|$|Eight years {{previous}} to the Once Upon a Time pilot (the two {{had just}} completed their work on Felicity, in 2002), Kitsis and Horowitz became inspired to write fairytales out of a love of [...] "mystery and excitement of exploring <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> worlds." [...] They presented the premise to networks, but were refused because of its fantastical nature. The two learned from their time on Lost {{to look at the}} story in a different way, that [...] "character has to trump mythology"; they expanded, [...] "as people, you've got to see what the void in their heart or in their lives is to care about them... For us, this was as much about the character journeys and seeing what was ripped from them in coming to Storybrooke– going at it that way as opposed to making it the 'break-the-curse show.'" [...] Despite the comparisons and similarities to Lost, the writers intend them to be very different shows. To them, Lost concerned itself with redemption, while Once Upon a Time is about [...] "hope".

500|$|She {{initially}} travelled to India to meet A. R. Rahman, {{but found}} it hard to communicate her ideas to him and the planned musical collaboration did not take place. Rahman did, however, provide M.I.A. with a number of contacts and allow her to use his studio, where 22 members of drumming group The Tapes were recorded for Kala. Producer Switch, who had initially travelled to India purely to engineer the planned sessions, ultimately became involved in the composition of several tracks for the album. A visit to Angola to work with DJ Znobia was cancelled after Znobia was involved in a car accident, but M.I.A. was able to record in Trinidad, Liberia, Jamaica and Australia. She and Switch relied heavily on Logic Pro, a digital audio workstation produced by Apple, and were able to capture vocals and background sounds outside the traditional studio environment, using a microphone and a Macbook Pro. The album features guest vocals from Afrikan Boy, The Wilcannia Mob, and Timbaland, and further collaborations with Switch, Blaqstarr, Morganics and Diplo. She likened the process of recording the album to [...] "making a big old marble cake with <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> countries and influences. Then you slice it up and call each slice a song".|$|E
500|$|Karen Hartley-Thomas was {{the hair}} and make-up {{designer}} for the production. She began prepping {{a couple of months}} before filming began, and she met with the director and producer early on to discuss the whole look of the film. Like the costumers, she read books and went to art galleries during her research. The female characters in Sense and Sensibility wear a [...] "no make-up look" [...] because in the time period in which the film is set, only the lower classes would have worn white and pink make-up. The Dashwood sisters wore no mascara and only a little corrective and blush. Hartley-Thomas also used very little make-up on the men, as she does not like them looking made up. Discussing the hair, Hartley-Thomas said [...] "Elinor's hair is always quite neat and done, where Marianne, being a freer character and more rebellious, she has <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> looks and lots of wild looks with the hair loose." [...] She also explained that some of the male actors wore wigs because the men in those days would have had a lot more volume to their hair, whereas the modern styles tend to be shorter and clippered. John Dashwood and his son were given red hair, as Hartley-Thomas wanted them to stand out amongst the more natural colours of the other male characters.|$|E

500|$|... "Ride Me to Hell" [...] {{was written}} by Mike Rowe and {{directed}} by Aaron Augenblick and series creator Devin Clark. Screenwriter and executive producer Daniel Powell said that the episode explores [...] "a little bit more" [...] about Mark's background, particularly that his father left {{him when he was}} younger, and that it [...] "sort of informs why he became a social worker". Unlike the series' first season, which paid homage mainly to horror films, season two referenced a variety of genres. In an interview with Matt Barone of the magazine Complex, Clark used [...] "Ride Me to Hell" [...] as an example that the season [...] "taps into a little bit beyond the horror culture". He referred it to as [...] "one of our big episodes" [...] and stated that it references contemporary shows with [...] "unsatisfied endings", such as Monk and Lost. In the episode, Grimes unleashes memories of being a cop in the 1970s, which Clark saw as an opportunity to make fun of 1970s cop shows, such as CHiPs and Starsky and Hutch. He said, [...] "It's always a fun opportunity to see what other worlds I can pull from, even beyond horror. We had some really fun opportunities this season to pull from old '70s cop shows. ... So, it's fun for me just to step out and try <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> styles and looks. I'm excited for whatever the writers throw at me, thematically. It's just a new opportunity to try something different." [...] "Ride Me to Hell" [...] was the fifth episode to be produced for the second season. In addition to the regular cast, the episode features appearances by recurring guest voice actors Pete Holmes, Julie Klausner and Mike O'Gorman.|$|E
500|$|Development of {{the game}} begun {{after the release of}} Nights into Dreams... in July 1996, after Sonic Team {{received}} a lot of letters from fans asking [...] "who Sonic was". Naka and Naoto Ohshima thought it was important to introduce people to the Sonic character, which was the basis for introducing [...] "Project Sonic" [...] to the public. Until the release of Sonic Jam, the studio themselves had not worked on a Sonic title since Sonic & Knuckles in 1994, in which Naka thought that Sonic Team had a good rest period to [...] "recharge our batteries" [...] and had new ideas regarding a new game. [...] "Sonic World"—Sonic Jams 3D hub world—served as a prototype for the first fully 3D Sonic game—Sonic Adventure—which began development for the Saturn but was moved to its successor, the Dreamcast. In a retrospective interview, Naka stated that the 3D section of Sonic Jam was part of an experiment to see how a Sonic the Hedgehog game would work in full 3D. [...] "Sonic World" [...] uses the same engine as Nights; there is speculation that Naka's refusal to share the Nights engine with the Sega Technical Institute (STI) team developing Sonic X-treme—a factor in the latter's cancellation—was motivated by his preference for Sonic Team's own efforts to create an original 3D Sonic title. Naka later expressed [...] "relief" [...] that X-treme was cancelled. Naka and Ohshima reflected that the most difficult part during the development process was gathering game-specific information in [...] "Sonic World", as [...] "there are so many games we have never even heard of...
