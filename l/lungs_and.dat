5|$|Birds {{have one}} of the most complex {{respiratory}} systems of all animal groups. Upon inhalation, 75% of the fresh air bypasses the <b>lungs</b> <b>and</b> flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the <b>lungs</b> <b>and</b> connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air. The other 25% of the air goes directly into the lungs. When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the <b>lungs</b> <b>and</b> the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs. Thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation. Sound production is achieved using the syrinx, a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from {{the lower end of the}} trachea; the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalisations and the perception of the bird's size.|$|E

40|$|Failure of {{the human}} heart to {{maintain}} sufficient output of blood for the demands of the body, heart failure, is a common condition with high mortality even with modern therapeutic alternatives. To identify molecular determinants of mortality in patients with new-onset heart failure, we performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies and follow-up genotyping in independent populations. We identified and replicated an association for a genetic variant on chromosome 5 q 22 with 36 % increased risk of death in subjects with heart failure (rs 9885413, P = 2. 7 x 10 ⁻⁹. We provide evidence from reporter gene assays, computational predictions and epigenomic marks that this polymorphism increases activity of an enhancer region active in multiple human tissues. The polymorphism was further reproducibly associated with a DNA methylation signature in whole blood (P = 4. 5 x 10 ⁻⁴⁰) that also associated with allergic sensitization and expression in blood of the cytokine TSLP (P = 1. 1 x 10 ⁻⁴). Knockdown of the transcription factor predicted to bind the enhancer region (NHLH 1) in a human cell line (HEK 293) expressing NHLH 1 resulted in lower TSLP expression. In addition, we observed evidence of recent positive selection acting on the risk allele in populations of African descent. Our findings provide novel genetic leads to factors that influence mortality in patients with heart failure.
