5|$|The {{great auk}} {{is the subject}} of a novel, The <b>Last</b> <b>Great</b> Auk by Allen Eckert, which tells of the events leading to the {{extinction}} of the great auk as seen from the perspective of the last one alive.|$|E
5|$|However, {{others argue}} that the Sun is {{currently}} close to the galactic plane, and yet the <b>last</b> <b>great</b> extinction event was 15 million years ago. Therefore, the Sun's vertical position cannot alone explain such periodic extinctions, and that extinctions instead occur when the Sun passes through the galaxy's spiral arms. Spiral arms are home not only to larger numbers of molecular clouds, whose gravity may distort the Oort cloud, but also to higher concentrations of bright blue giants, which live for relatively short periods and then explode violently as supernovae.|$|E
5|$|In 1871 {{he became}} the first Cavendish Professor of Physics at Cambridge. Maxwell was put in charge of the {{development}} of the Cavendish Laboratory, supervising every step in the progress of the building and of the purchase of the collection of apparatus. One of Maxwell's <b>last</b> <b>great</b> contributions to science was the editing (with copious original notes) of the research of Henry Cavendish, from which it appeared that Cavendish researched, amongst other things, such questions as the density of the Earth and the composition of water.|$|E

30|$|This {{analysis}} showed that diabetes was a significant independent risk factor {{for the development of}} chronic iritis <b>lasting</b> <b>greater</b> than 6  months in patients without a history of inflammation. Additionally, African American race was significantly correlated with post-operative iritis <b>lasting</b> <b>greater</b> than 1  month. We propose that altering the peri-operative treatment regimen for patients who are diabetic and/or African American could shorten and improve their post-operative recovery. Further investigation with a large-scale prospective trial would allow for a more powerful statistical analysis and may help to explain how these factors may contribute to post-operative inflammation.|$|R
5|$|In the {{following}} year, under Prince Henry of Prussia, Hülsen was entrusted {{with the defense}} of occupied Saxony, and was appointed commander-in-chief on 21 April, when the prince was removed to Silesia. At this point, {{the memory of the}} old general evidently diminished, for the king gave him a major general to assist his command. On 29 October 1762 at the Battle of Freiberg, the <b>last</b> <b>great</b> battle of the Seven Years' War, he could not participate as planned, since his replacement had not yet arrived, but he advanced to Pretzschendorf after the battle.|$|E
5|$|The Walls of Constantinople are {{a series}} of {{defensive}} stone walls that have surrounded and protected the city of Constantinople (today Istanbul in Turkey) since its founding as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Constantine the Great. With numerous additions and modifications during their history, they were the <b>last</b> <b>great</b> fortification system of antiquity, {{and one of the most}} complex and elaborate systems ever built.|$|E

5|$|The <b>last</b> <b>great</b> {{ruler of}} the Middle Kingdom, Amenemhat III, allowed Semitic-speaking Canaanite {{settlers}} from the Near East into the delta region to provide a sufficient labour force for his especially active mining and building campaigns. These ambitious building and mining activities, however, combined with severe Nile floods later in his reign, strained the economy and precipitated the slow decline into the Second Intermediate Period during the later Thirteenth and Fourteenth dynasties. During this decline, the Canaanite settlers began to seize control of the delta region, eventually coming to power in Egypt as the Hyksos.|$|E
5|$|In 287 BC, the plebeians again seceded. To end the secession, the lex Hortensia was passed, which {{required}} that plebiscites, laws {{passed by the}} Plebeian Council, be binding on the whole Roman people. The Hortensian law resolved the <b>last</b> <b>great</b> political question of the earlier era; the electoral and legislative sovereignty of the assemblies was confirmed and would remain part of the constitution until {{the demise of the}} Republic. As a whole, the outcome of the political struggles of the early republic was to eliminate the privileged status of patricians in the constitution and grant the plebs recognition of their own officers. The institution of the Senate was also now arguably stronger, as it became a repository of former magistrates rather than a body of hereditary nobles.|$|E
5|$|In this way, much to Metternich's {{disappointment}} and to Franz Josef's embarrassment, Austria began the Second Italian War of Independence against the combined forces of Piedmont-Sardinia and its ally France. Though Metternich {{was able to}} secure the replacement of Buol with his friend Rechberg, who had helped him so much in 1848, involvement in the war itself was now beyond his capacity. Even a special task given him by Franz Josef in June 1859—to draw up secret papers addressing the event of Franz Josef's death—was now too taxing. Shortly afterwards Metternich died in Vienna on 11 June 1859, aged 86, and the <b>last</b> <b>great</b> figure of his generation. Almost everyone of note in Vienna came to pay tribute; in the foreign press his death went virtually unnoticed.|$|E

5|$|It was in {{the later}} medieval era that the borders of Scotland reached {{approximately}} their modern extent. The Isle of Man fell under English control in the 14th century, despite several attempts to restore Scottish authority. The English were able to annexe a large slice of the lowlands under Edward III, but these losses were gradually regained, particularly while England was preoccupied with the Wars of the Roses (1455–85). In 1468 the <b>last</b> <b>great</b> acquisition of Scottish territory occurred when James III married Margaret of Denmark, receiving the Orkney Islands and the Shetland Islands in payment of her dowry. However, in 1482 Berwick, a border fortress and the largest port in medieval Scotland, fell to the English once again, for {{what was to be}} the final change of hands.|$|E
5|$|La Cousine Bette is {{considered}} Balzac's <b>last</b> <b>great</b> work. His trademark use of realist detail combines with a panorama of characters returning from earlier novels. Several critics have hailed it as {{a turning point}} in the author's career, and others have called it a prototypical naturalist text. It has been compared to William Shakespeare's Othello as well as Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace. The novel explores themes of vice and virtue, as well as the influence of money on French society. Bette's relationship with Valérie is also seen as an important exploration of homoerotic themes. A number of film versions of the story have been produced, including a 1971 BBC mini-series starring Margaret Tyzack and Helen Mirren, and a 1998 feature film with Jessica Lange in the title role.|$|E
5|$|Lancaster {{spent the}} 1350s {{intermittently}} campaigning and negotiating peace treaties with the French. In 1350 he {{was present at}} the naval victory at Winchelsea, where he allegedly saved the lives of the Black Prince and John of Gaunt. The years 1351–1352 he spent on crusade in Prussia. It was here that a quarrel with Otto, Duke of Brunswick, almost led to a duel between the two men, narrowly averted by the intervention of the French king, John II. In the later half of the decade campaigning in France resumed. After a chevauchée in Normandy in 1356 and the siege of Rennes in 1358, Lancaster participated in the <b>last</b> <b>great</b> offensive of {{the first phase of the}} Hundred Years' War: the Rheims campaign of 1359–1360. Then he was appointed principal negotiator for the Treaty of Brétigny, where the English achieved very favourable terms.|$|E
50|$|The NICHD {{nomenclature}} defines an acceleration as a visually apparent abrupt {{increase in}} fetal heart rate. An abrupt increase {{is defined as}} an increase from the onset of acceleration to the peak in {{less than or equal}} to 30 seconds. To be called an acceleration, the peak must be greater than or equal to 15 bpm, and the acceleration must <b>last</b> <b>greater</b> than or equal to 15 seconds from the onset to return to baseline.A prolonged acceleration is greater than or equal to 2 minutes but less than 10 minutes in duration. An acceleration <b>lasting</b> <b>greater</b> than or equal to 10 minutes is defined as a baseline change. Before 32 weeks of gestation, accelerations are defined as having a peak greater than or equal to 10 bpm and a duration of greater than or equal to 10 seconds.|$|R

5|$|Luoyang, {{the region}} of his birthplace, was {{recovered}} by government forces {{in the winter of}} 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill-health (by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments). They stayed in Kuizhou (in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing) {{at the entrance to the}} Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 766. This period was Du Fu's <b>last</b> <b>great</b> poetic flowering, and here he wrote 400 poems in his dense, late style.|$|E
5|$|The Hortensian Law {{deprived}} the patricians {{of their}} last weapon against the plebeians, and thus resolved the <b>last</b> <b>great</b> political question of the era. No such important political changes occurred between 287 BC and 133 BC. The important laws of this era were still enacted by the senate. In effect, the plebeians {{were satisfied with the}} possession of power, but did not care to use it. The senate was supreme during this era because the era was dominated by questions of foreign and military policy. This was the most militarily active era of the Roman Republic.|$|E
5|$|The film {{begins with}} an episode in 1279AD, when the {{successor}} of the <b>last</b> <b>great</b> Chola Emperor, pending invasion, sends his people to a mystery location, to survive the threat. The story resumes with an archaeologist, a coolie {{and a member of}} the army going in search of the archaeologist's father to the ruined city that was the place the exiled Chola Prince retreated to. An expedition is promptly arranged, and on the course they stumble on the lost Chola civilization and its king and find unexplained links between them and the culture. The shocking events and the problems that arise forms the crux of the story.|$|E

5|$|The first book, The Quest Begins, {{shows how}} {{each of the}} four bears are either {{abandoned}} or separated from their parents. Kallik is separated from her mother and brother when a pod of orcas (killer whales) eat her mother, while her brother was still {{on the other side of}} the canal, thinking they were both dead. After this, Kallik travels to find her brother. Toklo is abandoned by his mother after his brother, Tobi, dies and his mother sees how the salmon is disappearing, and left Toklo to travel alone. Lusa was born and raised in a zoo. Her story intertwines with Toklo's after his mother is brought to the zoo and Lusa hears of the wild. Hoping to leave her home, she escapes the zoo and looks for Toklo. Meanwhile, Toklo finds Ujurak injured and helps him; they begin to travel together. They meet up with Lusa at the end of the book. By Great Bear Lake, the four bears have joined together and they try to go to the Arctic. Although Kallik finds her brother Taqqiq, he has joined a group of bullying bears who kidnap a black bear cub. Taqqiq sees that what he did was wrong and joins the questing bears but he soon leaves the group in the third book when he feels he does not belong with them. The remaining four cubs learn of a place called the <b>Last</b> <b>Great</b> Wilderness in the third book, where there is plentiful food and shelter. After defying hardships such as hunger and bear hunters, they finally make it to the <b>Last</b> <b>Great</b> Wilderness. However, even though they are there, Ujurak, who leads the journey, feels that they need to go further, into the Arctic. In Fire in the Sky, the bears leave the <b>Last</b> <b>Great</b> Wilderness and travel towards the Arctic. In the sixth and final book of the first series, Spirits in the Stars, the four bears make it to Star Island, a place where many polar bears live. They find a sick mother polar bear and her cub. The mother dies from sickness and the four bears look after her cub. Toklo finds that he also struggles with his urge to become a brown bear and travel alone. The bears save the polar bears that inhabit Star Island by destroying an oil rig that was poisoning the seals that they eat, but Ujurak dies in an avalanche while saving the others. Yakone, a young white bear who lived on the strange Star Island with the sick bears, is added to the group of bears on the last page of the book.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately {{the revolutionary}} {{excesses of the}} period would prove {{disastrous}} for the French Navy. Poor leadership, conflicting and arbitrary orders and the decimation of the experienced seamen in the ranks promoted a negative attitude in the French officer corps. The French battlefleet did not contest British dominance in Northern European waters again, and their raiding operations repeatedly ended in failure {{at the hands of}} more confident British squadrons and the unforgiving Atlantic weather. By 1805, when the <b>last</b> <b>great</b> French fleet to take to the sea was crushed at the Battle of Trafalgar, poor training and low investment in the Navy had reduced its efficiency to levels unthinkable 20years earlier.|$|E
5|$|During {{the rule}} of Krishna II, the empire faced a revolt from the Eastern Chalukyas and its size {{decreased}} to the area including most of the Western Deccan and Gujarat. Krishna II ended the independent status of the Gujarat branch and brought it under direct control from Manyakheta. Indra III recovered the dynasty's fortunes in central India by defeating the Paramara and then invaded the doab region of the Ganges and Jamuna rivers. He also defeated the dynasty's traditional enemies, the Pratiharas and the Palas, while maintaining his influence over Vengi. The effect of his victories in Kannauj lasted several years according to the 930 copper plate inscription of Emperor Govinda IV. After a succession of weak kings during whose reigns the empire lost control of territories {{in the north and}} east, Krishna III the <b>last</b> <b>great</b> ruler consolidated the empire so that it stretched from the Narmada River to Kaveri River and included the northern Tamil country (Tondaimandalam) while levying tribute on the king of Ceylon.|$|E
