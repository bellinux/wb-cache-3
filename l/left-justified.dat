Players are listed by last name in the order in which they were listed on the lineup card for the game, showing all players who enter the game at any point whether they make a plate appearance or not. Their fielding positions or batting roles are normally listed next to their last name. Typically only last names are used, unless two players with the same name appear in the game, in which case a distinctive first initial is also used. When a player switches fielding position, both positions are listed. (Brian Hunter, in the sixth position of the Braves' batting order, started at left field but also served as the first baseman.) Substitute players are listed where they were placed in the batting order (in cases such as a double switch, not necessarily in the position of the player they replaced). Players who had an offensive role only are listed by that role: [...] "ph" [...] if they entered as a pinch hitter or [...] "pr" [...] if as a pinch runner. Substitutes who enter for defensive purposes and do not make a plate appearance have their fielding position shown and their batting line score shown as zeros. When a pinch hitter or pinch runner remains in the game, his fielding position is also listed. Some box scores will indent substitutes' names to indicate their spot in the order was the same as the non-indented starter's name above it; others will leave all names <b>left-justified.</b> (The Twins' Brian Harper pinch hit for Junior Ortiz and then remained in the game as catcher.) ...|$|E

Here we show {{that in some cases}} spurious correlations between scales can be introduced by the common <b>left-justified</b> definition. The consequences for a Markov process are discussed. These spurious correlations can be avoided by an appropriate nesting of increments. We demonstrate this effect for different data sets and show how it can be detected and quantified.
