5|$|In February 1946, Mutual {{introduced}} a quiz show, Twenty Questions, that would run {{for more than}} seven years. In October, the detective series Let George Do It, starring Bob Bailey, launched as a Mutual/Don Lee presentation; it would also run into the mid-1950s. For two years, starting in 1946 as well, Steve Allen got his first network exposure on the Mutual/Don Lee morning show Smile Time, out of Los Angeles's KHJ. In February 1947, the religiously oriented Family Theater premiered; with frequent appearances by major Hollywood stars, the series aired on Mutual for ten and a half years. That March, Kate Smith, a major star on CBS since 1931, moved over to Mutual. During most of her initial run at the network, which lasted until September 1951, she had two distinct weekday shows, each 15 minutes long: Kate Smith Speaks, at noon, and Kate Smith Sings, <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hour.</b> The network gave an outlet to radio dramatist Wyllis Cooper and his highly regarded suspense anthology Quiet, Please, which ran on Mutual from June 1947 to September 1948. It also aired actor Alan Ladd's similarly lauded drama about a crime-solving mystery novelist, Box 13, which ran for precisely a year. Its 52 episodes, which aired every Sunday beginning August 22, 1948, were produced by Ladd's own company, Mayfair Productions.|$|E

Facing the panelists in the Crowd Rules studio are representatives of three small businesses. On behalf of the audience, the panelists challenge the three businesses to describe their operations, successes, failures and future plans. Three times in each episode, electronic devices are used to poll the audience to determine which company is most worthy of the episode's cash prize. The initial vote is a [...] "first impression" [...] vote.

60|$|For {{many years}} I {{believed}} that every scrap of his writings had been burnt, but in July of 1914 the Librarian of the University of Cracow calling on me during our short visit to Poland, mentioned {{the existence of}} a few manuscripts of my father and especially of a series of letters written before and during his exile to his most intimate friend who had sent them to the University for preservation. I went to the Library at once, but had only time then for a mere glance. I intended to come back next day and arrange for copies being made of the whole correspondence. But next day there was war. So perhaps I shall never know now what he wrote to his most intimate friend <b>in</b> <b>the</b> time of his domestic happiness, of his new paternity, of his strong hopes--and <b>later,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hours</b> of disillusion, bereavement and gloom.|$|R

30|$|The LEMI diurnal-seasonal {{behavior}} of B 0 is somewhat {{different from the}} IRI prediction (Fig. 6 (b)).

The IRI’s evening collapse occurs <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evening <b>hours</b> (18 – 21 LT) in comparison to LEMI. Both models give comparable daytime seasonal patterns of B 0, though IRI overestimates the winter B 0 and underestimates the summer B 0. Compared to LEMI, the IRI predicts an opposite nighttime seasonal behavior with the December minimum (68 km) and the June maximum (92 km).|$|R

5|$|Moving very little, the {{depression}} was disorganized due to continued shear, leaving {{the center of}} circulation west of the convective activity. By <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning <b>hours</b> of May27, <b>the</b> system began to show overall signs of organization, primarily related to a burst of convection <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eastern semicircle. At the same time, the center of circulation either reformed or began to move farther north, possibly north-northeast. Embedded within the steering currents of a ridge, most forecasts anticipated the storm would drift northward for several days, though some computer models predicted the storm would eventually move inland near Acapulco. At 1800UTC on May27, {{the depression}} organized into a tropical storm, and as such was named Aletta by the National Hurricane Center.|$|R
40|$|On 11 May 1995 the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) was {{extended}} indefinitely without a vote after {{almost a month}} of deliberations amongst states parties at UN headquarters in New York.

The failure of the Conference to agree a Final Declaration means that it cannot be regarded as an overwhelming success.

25|$|Most {{businesses}} {{continued to}} operate when possible and stocks lasted. They {{were not allowed}} to discriminate between local and German customers. The Germans had a very favourable exchange rate, so while shops had goods, including clothes, boots, cigarettes, tea and coffee, they bought everything up in massive quantities and posted them back to Germany, many for resale at a profit. Shops did not hold stocks back for locals until <b>later</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> war. Business <b>hours</b> were reduced, shop workers who had worked nine-hour days, 15 on Saturdays, were reduced to 20 hours a week.|$|R

During 1988 The Hit Man and Her was moved to 2am in some areas, while London still broadcast the show at 4am. The Hitman and Her remained at the 2am slot from April 1989 until its very last broadcast.

On 12 June it was suggested that the Queen's Speech, which had been due to set out the government's legislative agenda on 19 June, could be delayed to give the DUP and Conservatives more time to negotiate. It was reported that the ongoing dialogue could have delayed the start of Brexit negotiations with the EU, which were also due to begin on 19 June.|$|R
5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{case was}} that Bamber, motivated by hatred and greed, had left White House Farm around 10pm on 6 August 1985, after dining with his family, {{to drive to}} his home in Head Street, Goldhanger. <b>Later,</b> perhaps <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early <b>hours</b> of <b>the</b> morning of 7 August, he had returned to the farm on his mother's bicycle—which he had borrowed a few days earlier—cycling along a route that avoided the main roads and approaching the house from the back.

40|$|Following an ischemic stroke, T {{lymphocytes}} become activated, {{infiltrate the}} brain, {{and appear to}} release cytokines and reactive oxygen species to contribute to early inflammation and brain injury. However, some subsets of T lymphocytes may be beneficial even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early stages after a stroke, and recent evidence suggests that T lymphocytes can {{also contribute to the}} repair and regeneration of the brain at <b>later</b> stages. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>hours</b> to days after stroke, T-lymphocyte numbers are then reduced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blood and <b>in</b> secondary lymphoid organs as part of a ‘stroke-induced immunodeficiency syndrome,’ which is mediated by hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, resulting in increased risk of infectious complications. Whether or not poststroke T-lymphocyte activation occurs via an antigen-independent process, as opposed to a classical antigen-dependent process, is still controversial. Although considerable recent progress has been made, {{a better understanding of the}} roles of the different T-lymphocyte subpopulations and their temporal profile of damage versus repair will help to clarify whether T-lymphocyte targeting may be a viable poststroke therapy for clinical use...|$|R
