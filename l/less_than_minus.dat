The sensing system is characterized from room temperature (25 C) to 300 C for a pressure range from 0 to 100 psi. The wireless pressure system consists of a Clapp-type oscillator design with a capacitive MEMS pressure sensor located in the LC-tank circuit of the oscillator. Therefore, as {{the pressure of the}} aircraft engine changes, so does the output resonant frequency of the sensing system. A chip antenna is integrated to transmit the system output to a receive antenna 10 m away. The design frequency of the wireless pressure sensor is 127 MHz and a 2 increase in resonant frequency over the temperature range of 25 to 300 C from 0 to 100 psi is observed.

Setting: Low-income areas (income < 20 th percentile) in semi-urban Mexico (defined as towns or cities with 2500 - 50 000 inhabitants). Subjects: Eight hundred and ninety-six children aged 12. 5 - 23. 5 months surveyed from September to December 2001. Methods: Questionnaire survey and anthropometric survey of households. Multivariate regression models evaluated differences across age in anthropometry (height-for-age Z-score (HAZ) and weight-for-height Z-score) and cognitive function (Mental Development Index (MDI) of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development) while controlling for socio-economic and parental characteristics. Results: There was a significant decline in HAZ and in age-adjusted MDI score across the second year of life. Although the children showed MDI scores close to the mean, normed US values at 13 - 14 months, the scores were significantly lower than expected in older children (P < 0. 0001), even after controlling for socio-economic status and parental characteristics. At 13 - 14 months, only 3 % of children received scores below 70 (<b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>minus</b> two standard deviations), whereas by 19 - 20 months, almost 17 % of children were performing below this level. No socio-economic or parental characteristics were significant predictors of HAZ or MDI. Conclusions: Parallel deficits are evident in both height-for-age and cognitive functioning during the second year of life in low-income Mexican infants.

40|$|The {{asymptotically}} flat {{structure of}} N=(2, 0) supergravity in three spacetime dimensions is explored. The asymptotic symmetries are spanned by {{an extension of}} the super-BMS_ 3 algebra, with two independent û(1) currents of electric and magnetic type. These currents are associated to U(1) fields being even and odd under parity, respectively. Remarkably, although the U(1) fields do not generate a backreaction on the metric, they provide nontrivial Sugawara-like contributions to the BMS_ 3 generators, and hence to the energy and the angular momentum. The entropy of flat cosmological spacetimes with U(1) fields then acquires a nontrivial dependence on the û(1) charges. If the spin structure is odd, the ground state corresponds to Minkowski spacetime, and although the anticommutator of the canonical supercharges is linear in the energy and in the electric-like û(1) charge, the energy becomes bounded from below by the energy of the ground state shifted by the square of the electric-like û(1) charge. If the spin structure is even, the same bound for the energy generically holds, unless the absolute value of the electric-like charge is <b>less</b> <b>than</b> <b>minus</b> the mass of Minkowski spacetime in vacuum, so that the energy has to be nonnegative. The explicit form of the Killing spinors is found for a wide class of configurations that fulfills our boundary conditions, and they exist precisely when the corresponding bounds are saturated. It is also shown that the spectra with periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions for the fermionic fields are related by spectral flow, in a similar way as it occurs for the N= 2 super-Virasoro algebra. Indeed, our super-BMS_ 3 algebra can be recovered from the flat limit of the superconformal algebra with N=(2, 2), truncating the fermionic generators of the right copy.

Objetivos: Examinar o efeito de suplementaÃÃo oral de AG ou placebo glicina (G) na funÃÃo de barreira intestinal e crescimento em crianÃas sob risco nutricional residentes na comunidade do Parque UniversitÃrio do Pici. MÃtodos: Ensaio clÃnico randomizado controlado em crianÃas maiores de 6 meses e menores de 8 anos de idade, com pelo menos um dos escores z para os indicadores antropomÃtricos (IAs) (peso-para-idade, estatura-para-idade e peso-para-estatura) < - 1. Cento e sete crianÃas foram randomizadas, entre julho de 2003 a novembro de 2004, para receberem AG (24 g/dia) ou G (25 g/dia) em quantidades isonitrogÃnicas por 10 dias.

Objectives: Examine the effect of oral AG supplementation or the placebo Glycine (G) on intestinal barrier function and growth in children {{who are at risk}} for malnutrition and are residents of the University Park of Pici community.

One hundred and seven children were randomized between July 2003 and November 2004, to receive AG (24 g/day) or G (25 g/day) in iso-nitrogenic quantities for 10 days. The urinary excretion of Lactulose:Mannitol was used as a measure of intestinal permeability, and was performed on the first and tenth days of the study protocol. The weight and height of the children were collected on the 1, 10, 30, and 120 days of the study protocol to calculate the AIs. Results: The percentage of urinary excretion of Lactulose decreased significantly in the group that received AG (p < 0. 05 Student T test), but not in the group that received G. The cumulative improvement in the Anthropometrical Indicators, weight-for-height and weight-for-age on the 120 day of the study protocol were significant when covariant analysis was performed in the group which received AG versus the control group G (p < 0. 04 and < 0. 029, respectively).
