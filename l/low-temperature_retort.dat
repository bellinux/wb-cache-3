40|$|The {{chlorinated}} {{organic compounds}} in sewage sludges are only partially decomposed during low-temperature (300 - 400 C) conversion. Remaining intermediate products posses high toxicities. By catalytic gas phase treatment of <b>low-temperature</b> <b>retort</b> sewage sludge gas an almost complete dehalogenation (> 99 %) can be achieved. The most efficient catalysts consist of Fe, Ni or Co oxides on a #gamma#-Al_ 2 O_ 3 carrier. By this additional catalytic treatment of pyrolysis oil is obtained, which is almost free of chlorinated toxic compounds.

40|$|AbstractAs a kind {{of fossil}} fuels, oil shale has earn more and more {{attention}} with the soaring of international oil price. The calorific capacity of the oil shale is only inferior {{to that of the}} coal. Oil shale can be exploited to extract oil and gas by retorting and power generation by direct combustion. Shale oil, a synthetic crude oil which was produced by low temperature retorting of oil shale may be used as fuel oil directly, also may be transformed as the gasoline, the diesel oil by further treatment. Coal gas and semi-coke are the by-product of oil shale production after <b>low-temperature</b> <b>retorting</b> which can be used as power plant fuel, the oil shale ash may be used as the building materials and soil fertilization matter. The oil shale retorting, the refinery oil, the semi-coke combustion power generation and the ash residue utilization organic union in the together theory realizes the comprehensive utilization of non-solid waste emissions finally. Comprehensive utilization of oil shale resources not only makes up the petroleum shortage but also phases down environmental pollution. Furthermore, circulation economic efficiency, the environmental benefit and the social efficiency are enhanced obviously...|$|R
40|$|A {{step-by-step}} {{mathematical model}} was deduced for {{description of the}} co-effect of time, temperature and heating rate at low-temperature (370 – 410 °C) on the yield of kukersite oil shale pyrolysis products in a laboratory retort. According to the scheme applied, the parallel formation of thermobitumen and volatiles from kukersite, and parallel-consequent formation of volatiles and coke from the thermobitumen formed were approximated to the first order kinetic reactions. The algorithms for estimation of the corresponding rate coefficients (k 1 –k 4) were proposed. The values of apparent activation energy (E 1 -E 4) and frequency factor (A 1 -A 4) were calculated using the temperature dependencies of the rate coefficients estimated {{on the basis of}} experimental results obtained at isothermal retorting. A kinetic compensation effect was revealed between the bulk of kinetic constants found: lnA = 0. 176 (± 0. 009) E – 2. 59 (± 2. 29). The share factors and their temperature dependencies for distribution of malthenes and asphaltenes in thermo-bitumen, and gas and oil in volatiles were found from the experimental results of kukersite <b>low-temperature</b> <b>retorting.</b> The effect of time on the yield of the products predicted introducing the constants found into the model deduced agreed satisfactory with the experimental results obtained at retort-ing of kukersite under non-linear increase of temperature up to 370 – 410 °C and keeping 20 – 60 minutes under the nominal temperature...|$|R
