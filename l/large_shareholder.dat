25|$|Operation of the {{railroad}} was hampered by its partial government ownership. Of the thirty members on its board of directors, twelve were elected by shareholders while the other eighteen were appointed either by Maryland or the Baltimore City Council.

These conflicts became more intense in the 1850s after the completion of the C Canal, which brought additional competition to the B for transport services. In 1858, after being nominated by <b>large</b> <b>shareholder</b> and director Johns Hopkins, John W. Garrett became president of the B, a position he would hold until his death in 1884.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{reports on}} {{empirical}} {{investigations into the}} relationship between dividend policy and ownership structure of firms, using a sample of 139 listed Italian companies. Ownership structure in Italy is highly concentrated and hence the relevant agency problem to analyse {{seems to be the}} one that arises from the conflicting interests of <b>large</b> <b>shareholders</b> and minority shareholders. This paper therefore attempts to test the rent extraction hypothesis by relating the firm’s dividend payout ratio to various ownership variables, which measure the degree of concentration in terms of the voting rights of <b>large</b> <b>shareholders.</b> The hypothesis that other non-controlling <b>large</b> <b>shareholders</b> may have incentives to monitor the <b>largest</b> <b>shareholder</b> is also tested. The results of the empirical analysis reveal that firms make lower dividend payouts as the voting rights of the <b>largest</b> <b>shareholder</b> increase. Results also suggest that the presence of agreements among <b>large</b> <b>shareholders</b> might explain the limited monitoring power of other ‘strong’ non-controlling shareholders.

30|$|According {{to studies}} on {{multiple}} <b>large</b> <b>shareholders</b> (Zwiebel 1995; Laeven and Levine 2008), <b>large</b> <b>shareholders</b> {{are less likely}} to be active in monitoring when the distribution of shareholdings is more diversified. We calculate the ownership dispersion by dividing the shares held by the controller over the sum of shares owned by the second to fifth <b>largest</b> <b>shareholders.</b> A lower ratio indicates a more balanced ownership structure. In this case, we expect that non-family-chair firms would be more likely to underperform family-chair firms when there are <b>large</b> <b>shareholders</b> with comparable ownerships than those with a leading controlling shareholder.|$|R
