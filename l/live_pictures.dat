The most ferocious battle occurred when Mackenzie wanted Sky News to run an interview with Lady Bienvenida Buck. Frykberg refused to air the interview and resigned shortly afterwards. The interview was broadcast on Sky One.

2500|$|Fluoroscopy (...) is an imaging {{technique}} that uses X-rays to obtain real-time moving {{images of the}} interior of an object. In its primary application of medical imaging, a fluoroscope (...) allows a physician to see the internal structure and function of a patient, so that the pumping action of the heart or the motion of swallowing, for example, can be watched. This is useful for both diagnosis and therapy and occurs in general radiology, interventional radiology, and image-guided surgery. In its simplest form, a fluoroscope consists of an X-ray source and a fluorescent screen, between which a patient is placed. However, since the 1950s most fluoroscopes have included X-ray image intensifiers and cameras as well, to improve the image's visibility and make it available on a remote display screen. For many decades fluoroscopy tended to produce <b>live</b> <b>pictures</b> that were not recorded, but since the 1960s, as technology improved, recording and playback became the norm.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{user-interface}} and distributed imaging system for controlling robotic web-cameras via a wireless cellular phone. A user scrolls an image canvas {{to select a}} new <b>live</b> <b>picture.</b> The cellular phone application (a Java MIDlet) sends a URL request, which encodes the new pan/tilt/optical-zoom of a <b>live</b> <b>picture,</b> to a web-camera server. The user downloads a new <b>live</b> <b>picture</b> centered on the user's new viewpoint. The web-camera server mediates requests from users, by time-sharing control of the physical robotic hardware. By processing a queue of user requests at different pan/tilt/zoom locations, the server can capture a single photograph for each user. While one user downloads a new live image, the robotic camera moves to capture images and service other independent user requests. The end-toend system enables each user to independently steer the robotic camera, viewing <b>live</b> snapshot <b>pictures</b> from a cellular phone...|$|R
