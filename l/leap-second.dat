2500|$|MSF {{does not}} {{broadcast}} any explicit advance warning of upcoming leap seconds, which occur less {{than once a}} year on average. [...] The only indication {{is a change in}} the number of padding bits before the time code during the minute before the leap second. [...] Therefore, unless a <b>leap-second</b> announcement is manually entered into a receiver in advance, it may take some time until an autonomous MSF receiver regains synchronization with UTC after a leap second (especially if the reception is not robust {{at the time of the}} leap second).|$|E
2500|$|In 1972, the <b>leap-second</b> {{system was}} {{introduced}} {{so that the}} broadcast UTC seconds could be made exactly equal to the standard SI second, while still maintaining the UTC time of day and changes of UTC date synchronized with those of UT1 (the solar time standard that superseded GMT). By then, the UTC clock was already 10 seconds behind TAI, which had been synchronized with UT1 in 1958, but had been counting true SI seconds since then. After 1972, both clocks have been ticking in SI seconds, so the difference between their readouts at any time is 10 seconds plus {{the total number of}} leap seconds that have been applied to UTC (37 seconds [...] ).|$|E

50|$|BPM is {{idiosyncratic}} {{in that it}} transmits UT1 {{time between}} minutes 25 through to 29 and 55 through to 59, which creates an odd click-beep effect when heard below a stronger time signal station such as WWV especially when UT1 seconds are halfway between UTC seconds, close to a <b>leap-second</b> event.|$|E

40|$|Today {{we talk to}} {{photographer}} Arianna Lodeserto. Her work {{explores the}} urban environment through aerial photomontages which defuse and disrupt the city grid. Arianna has studied and exhibited widely in Paris and Rome where she currently lives and works. As <b>Leap-Second</b> moves from Marylebone to our new location on the First Floor of 183 - 185 Bermondsey St we’d like {{to introduce you to}} another of our exhibiting artists. Johannes Rigal of Gasket has asked each artist a series of questions to explore the concepts and processes involved in their work, and by doing so, show what makes us so excited about this exhibition...|$|E
40|$|A {{recommendation}} pending {{before the}} study {{groups of the}} International Telecommuni-cations Union – Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) would abolish leap seconds in Coordi-nated Universal Time (UTC). This would have significant near-term consequences to astro-dynamics, astronomy, and other technical fields, and long-term societal and cultural impli-cations. This paper invigorates the long standing <b>leap-second</b> debate with an open discussion of issues quietly considered for over a decade. It presents {{the pros and cons}} of the proposed change to UTC to those potentially affected by it. With the understanding that standards al-ready accepted and implemented should be changed only in the most strongly justifiable cir-cumstances, this paper recommends an approach that the authors feel meets technical, po-litical, and operational needs.

30|$|The {{most common}} use of GPS is to {{determine}} the coordinates of the receiver, however, for PMU, one pulse-per-second transmitted by the GPS is the most important element. This pulse received by any receiver on earth is coincident with all other pulses received within 1 μs. These pulses are provided by the accurate clock signals which are maintained by GPS and these clock signals are known as the GPS time which {{does not take into account}} the earth’s rotation. Corrections to the GPS time are made in the GPS receivers to account for this difference (<b>leap-second</b> correction), so that the receivers provide coordinated universal time. It should be noted that the PMU standard uses UNIX time base with a “second-of-century” (SOC) counter which began counting at midnight on January 1, 1970.|$|E
30|$|In the {{automatic}} detection process, we first performed a FFT {{analysis of the}} PFX waveform data to detect the signal around 10.2  kHz. When the monochromatic signal at 10.2  kHz was detected in the PFX data, we determined the station that broadcast the signal, referring to the unique frequency pattern {{for each of the}} eight different Omega stations. For this process, it was first necessary to synchronize the Omega time with UTC time because the Omega system did not have <b>leap-second</b> correction. Next, we calculated the delay time of the signal by subtracting the raise time of the signal from the transmission time. The raise time is the arrival time of the Omega signal at 10.2  kHz, as determined by detecting the sudden increase in signal intensity at the center frequency (10.2  kHz), compared with those of surrounding frequencies (Suarjaya et al. 2016). As a next step, the signal intensity was determined when the average intensity at the center frequency was large enough to compare with those of surrounding frequency and ambient noise. Some error detection and correction were also applied to produce reliable results. The detection method developed by Suarjaya et al. (2016) is based on transmission frequency pattern, transmission time, and location of each Omega station combined with a fixed threshold, that minimizes the contamination of the VLF sources (for example, from other Omega stations). In addition, comparison of upper and lower frequencies introduced in their detection method enables exclusion of any events contaminated by whistlers.|$|E
