40|$|On four dairy farms, {{the labour}} demand {{and effects of}} {{alternate}} farming plans on labour efficiency and financial results are studied. Insight into the development of labour demand during a year was obtained by <b>labour</b> <b>recording</b> during three weeks (week 39, 43 and 46) and by labour budgeting. To record labour demand, every worker on the farms recorded exactly how many quarters of an hour were spent on welldefined treatments. Labour budgeting is done using the computer-model AgroWerk. To obtain detailed input data for this model, all farms were visited and data were collected together with the farmers. As expected, the results of <b>labour</b> <b>recording</b> and labour budgeting were different. <b>Labour</b> <b>recording</b> during three weeks gave specific information about the farms in question and during these three weeks, but did not represent the labour demand for seasonal activities. Further, {{it was difficult for}} the workers to distinguish some categories of treatments. It was concluded that labour budgeting gave the best insight into labour demand and its distribution over the year, especially when combined with the data obtained by <b>labour</b> <b>recording.</b> Total labour demands were between 4268 hours on the dairy farm with 91 dairy cows and 6659 hours on the farm with 89 cows. Labour demand per 1000 kg milk was between 5. 6 and 8. 0 hours. Labour demand was affected by farm size (scale effects), farming out the cattle breed, calling in agricultural contractors and the intensity of the grassland use (kg milk per ha). For each farm, effects of one or two alternative business plans on labour demand and financial results were calculated. The alternatives consisted of combinations of expansion of farm size, expansion of the milking shed or purchase of a milking robot, and several other changes in equipment and management. In all cases the work efficiency improved. Six alternatives resulted in reduction of total work demand, three of them also in a light improvement of financial results. In three other cases, the financial results decreased firmly. Evaluating the project, the farmers judged it gave them good insight in labour input and labour demand on their farms and in effects of alternate farming plans on labour efficiency and financial results. They intend to use the results in their business plans...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The partograph (or partogram) is {{recommended}} by the World Health Organisation (WHO), for monitoring labour wellbeing and progress. Concerns about limitations {{in the way the}} partograph is used in the clinical context and the potential impact on its effectiveness have led to this realist systematic review of partograph use. Methods This review aimed to answer two key questions, 1) What is it about the partograph that works (or does not work); for whom does it work; and in what circumstances? 2) What are the essential inputs required for the partograph to work? A comprehensive search strategy encompassed key databases; including papers of varying methodologies. Papers were selected for inclusion if the focus of the paper was the partograph and related to context, mechanism or outcome. Ninety five papers were included for data synthesis. Two authors completed data extraction and synthesis. Results The evidence synthesis relates the evidence to identified theories of health worker acceptability, health system support, effective referral systems, human resources and health worker competence, highlighting barriers and facilitators. Conclusions This first comprehensive realist synthesis of the partograph, provides the international community of maternity clinicians with a picture of potential issues and solutions related to successful <b>labour</b> <b>recording</b> and management, which is also translatable to other monitoring approaches...|$|E

40|$|Information {{provides}} {{the basis for}} decisions and therefore, {{the quality of a}} decision will be affected by the type and quality of information available. The information requirements of plant nursery businesses, with special reference to production planning and costing systems, were determined. To achieve this a three-stage approach was undertaken. A survey of management information systems in 343 plant nurseries was conducted. Information requirements and the types of information systems were ascertained. Nursery managers mainly use financial and accounting information systems, such as accounts payable (90 %), accounts receivable (93 %) and payroll (65 %) with only 20 % of nurseries having production <b>labour</b> <b>recording</b> systems. Most nurseries are small to medium sized businesses with 71 percent of respondents having a turnover of less than $ 0. 5 m. Seventy one percent of larger nurseries (>$ 1 m turnover) are intending to implement additional information systems. In contrast, only 35 percent of small (<$ 100, 000) businesses are seeking to implement more comprehensive systems. Their main pricing methods were cost-plus, perceived value and comparative pricing. However, only 30 percent had records of resource use per crop to enable costing of plants. Time (63 %) and cost (21 %) were the main constraints. The second stage involved developing a computer planning model as a catalyst for discussion in case study interviews. This model was designed to aid the scheduling plant production to meet a sales plan. The model allowed a specified sales plan to utilise plant production details and resource inputs and produced production schedules and consequent resource use information. The third, and main, stage involved intensively interviewing selected nursery managers about their information requirements. The 10 nursery managers were identified from the survey as having an interest in information systems. Managers use historical sales' records to make product mix and production timing decisions. Nurseries are a complex ' biological manufacturing system' where techniques developed in manufacturing industries show potential in overcoming many information problems. The main constraints on information system development, maintenance, adoption and use were time and cost and the collection and processing of plant production field data. A system of descriptive crop labelling is suggested to overcome the data collection problem by utilising activity-based costing techniques developed in manufacturing industries, and bar codes from the retail sector. Improved production planning and control systems with linkages to a costing and accounting system are required. An activity-based costing system could be used to overcome many of the problems and reduce data collection and administrative time...|$|E
