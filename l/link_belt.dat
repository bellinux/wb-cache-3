2500|$|The M242 Bushmaster is a 25 mm (25×137mm) chain-fed autocannon. It is used {{extensively}} by the United States and NATO forces in ground combat vehicles and watercraft. Originally, the weapon {{was designed and}} manufactured by McDonnell Douglas. it is now produced by ATK at its Mesa, Arizona facility. It is an externally powered, chain driven, single-barrel weapon which may be fired in semi-automatic, burst, or automatic modes. It is fed by a metallic <b>link</b> <b>belt</b> and has dual-feed capability. The term [...] "chain gun" [...] derives {{from the use of}} a roller chain that drives the bolt back and forth. The gun can destroy lightly armored vehicles and aerial targets, such as helicopters and slow-flying aircraft. It can also suppress enemy positions such as exposed troops, dug-in positions, and occupied built-up areas. The standard rate of fire is 200 rounds per minute. The weapon has an effective range of , {{depending on the type of}} ammunition used.|$|E

5000|$|William Dana Ewart (April 24, 1851 - May 3, 1908) invented and {{patented}} the <b>linked</b> <b>belt,</b> {{a square}} detachable <b>link</b> for chain <b>belts,</b> on September 1, 1874. The metal chain [...] "linked belt" [...] replaced the leather and strap belts used on agricultural equipment at the time.|$|R
50|$|The V6 {{engine is}} fitted with four {{overhead}} camshafts driven by synchronous tooth belts. It has a single, long, serpentine belt {{at the front}} driving the inlet cams and also the coolant pump. The exhaust cams are driven by short <b>link</b> <b>belts</b> driven from {{the ends of the}} inlet cams {{at the rear of the}} engine. The system was a joint development between Dayco (belt supplier) and Rover.The rear <b>link</b> <b>belts</b> do not incorporate any tensioning device. Belt tension is maintained by very careful control of belt length and the pulley pair is pre-tensioned during fitting. The front belt drive is tensioned by a spring-loaded tensioner pulley incorporating a hydraulic damping element.|$|R
5|$|The M249 is a belt-fed {{light machine}} gun. It fires the 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge, usually a {{combination}} of one M856 tracer and four M855 ball cartridges fed from M27 <b>linked</b> <b>belts.</b> Belts are typically held in a hard plastic or soft canvas box attached to {{the underside of the}} weapon.|$|R

50|$|The AGS-17 Plamya (Russian: Пламя) is a Soviet-designed {{automatic}} {{grenade launcher}} currently in {{production in the}} Russian Federation. The AG-17 weapon system uses VOG-17M fragmentation rounds with a non-delay point fuse detonating on impact, designed to engage soft-targets in cover. The weapon is fed from a box-stowed, metal <b>linked</b> <b>belt</b> holding 166 rounds.|$|R

50|$|As {{the gun was}} {{originally}} designed, ammunition could be fed by a 5-round clip, a 15-round <b>link</b> <b>belt,</b> or a non-disintegrating 30-round endless belt magazine. The 30-round endless belt version was used exclusively in production. The M4 gun fed only from the left.|$|E

5000|$|Today the CVT works {{according}} to the same principle of split pulleys allowing infinitely variable gear ratios. Rather than the pulled rubber drive belts as originally used by DAF, the modern transmission is made much more durable {{by the use of}} steel <b>link</b> <b>belts</b> that are pushed by their pulleys. This update was pioneered by Fiat, Ford and Van Doorne in the Netherlands from the late 1970s. [...] The gearbox is also under electronic control.|$|R
50|$|The initial M61 used <b>linked,</b> <b>belted</b> ammunition, but the {{ejection}} of spent links created considerable (and ultimately insuperable) problems. The original {{weapon was}} soon {{replaced by the}} M61A1, with a linkless feed system. Depending on the application, the feed system can be either single-ended (ejecting spent cases and unfired rounds) or double-ended (returning casings back to the magazine). A disadvantage of the M61 is {{that the bulk of}} the weapon, its feed system, and ammunition drum makes it difficult to fit it into a densely packed airframe.|$|R

50|$|A {{key element}} of the ShKAS' high rate of fire is the {{revolving}} drum (feed cage) that holds ten rounds and provides a very smooth, progressive removal of the cartridges from their disintegrating <b>link</b> <b>belt.</b> Another element is the lightweight recoiling portion of the gun, weighing only 921 grams (2.07 lb).|$|E

5000|$|Technically not a [...] "cannon", the Minigun is more {{correctly}} {{classified as}} a rotary machine gun.During the Vietnam War, the 7.62 mm caliber M134 Minigun was originally created to arm rotary-wing aircraft, and could be fitted to various helicopters as either a crew-served or a remotely operated weapon. With a rate of fire from 2,000 to 6,000 rounds per minute from a 4,000-round <b>linked</b> <b>belt,</b> the Minigun proved {{to be one of}} the most effective non-explosive projectile weapons ever built [...] and is still used in helicopters today.|$|R
5000|$|As an {{alternative}} to manual synchromesh gearboxes, automatic continuously variable transmission (CVT) gearboxes are optional on some economy cars, such as Audi, Honda, and the MINI ONE and MINI Cooper. Tata Motors from India, recently announced that it too would use a variomatic transmission in its [...] Nano. CVT application to economy cars was pioneered by Fiat, Ford, and Van Doorne in the 1980s. Rather than the pulled rubber drive belts as {{used in the past}} by DAF, the modern transmission is made much more durable by the use of electronic control and steel <b>link</b> <b>belts</b> pushed by their pulleys.|$|R

5000|$|The 37 mm M10 autocannon {{was a minor}} {{improvement}} of the M4. It was fed by metallic disintegrating <b>link</b> <b>belt</b> and had slightly higher rate of fire at around 165 rpm.

The M10 replaced the M4 in aircraft, starting with the A-9 model of the Bell P-63 Kingcobra., ...|$|E

500|$|Of {{the coins}} {{that were not}} redeemed, some were likely lost in the fires that devastated Honolulu's Chinatown in 1887 and 1900. [...] Members of that {{community}} were often distrustful of banks, and hid valuables in their homes. Quantities of the remainder {{were used in the}} jewelry trade, which bought several thousand dollars worth in the final months the coins remained legal tender. In the years after territorial status was granted Hawaii in 1900, many sought keepsakes of the vanished kingdom, and a large variety of souvenir items featuring the coins were [...] sold as enameled (and unenameled) jewelry: pins, watch fobs, cuff <b>links,</b> <b>belt</b> buckles, hat bands and hat pins. Decorative items such as spoons and napkin rings were also made. Generally, the side featuring the coat of arms is the one enameled.|$|R
