40|$|International audienceIn this paper, a {{study of}} quality {{monitoring}} technology for the <b>laser</b> <b>welding</b> was conducted. The <b>laser</b> <b>welding</b> and the industrial robotic systems were used with robot-based <b>laser</b> <b>welding</b> systems. The <b>laser</b> system {{used in this study}} was 1. 6 kW fiber laser, while the robot system was Industrial robot (pay-load : 130 kg). The robot-based <b>laser</b> <b>welding</b> system was equipped with a laser scanner system for remote <b>laser</b> <b>welding.</b> The welding joints of steel plate and steel plate coated with zinc were butt and lapped joints. The remote <b>laser</b> <b>welding</b> system with <b>laser</b> scanner system is used to increase the processing speed and to improve the efficiency of processes. The welding joints of steel plate and steel plate coated with zinc were butt and lapped joints. The quality testing of the <b>laser</b> <b>welding</b> was conducted by observing the shape of the beads on the plate and the cross-section of the welded parts, analyzing the results of mechanical tension test, and monitoring the plasma intensity by using UV and IR sensor.

40|$|Conduction <b>laser</b> <b>welding</b> {{opens up}} a range of {{innovative}} applications for <b>laser</b> <b>welding.</b> This relatively novel mode of laser processing expands the application potential significantly beyond what is normally achieved today. The main reason for this {{could be attributed to}} the different characteristics of conduction process when compared to keyhole <b>laser</b> <b>welding.</b> An example is the higher stability of conduction which results in welds of higher quality and better control of the welding process. Despite the advantages of conduction <b>laser</b> <b>welding,</b> it is yet to be exploited significantly for industrial applications and there are very few applications for which this mode of operation is used. This paper is aimed at presenting different varieties of applications for conduction <b>laser</b> <b>welding</b> using a fibre laser.

40|$|The {{application}} of <b>laser</b> <b>welding</b> is increasing for joining automotive components {{to the body}} in white.

50|$|Silver brazed diamond blades' diamond {{segments}} are brazed to {{the steel}} core using a silver solder. These blades {{can only be}} used in wet cuttings. If they are used in dry cuttings, the silver solder may melt and the segments can break from the steel core and become a serious safety hazard. A laser melts and combines the metal of the diamond segment and the steel core creating a stronger weld, which can hold the segments even in high temperatures, meaning that <b>laser</b> <b>welded</b> diamond blades {{can be used to}} cut many types of stone without water cooling. However, when cutting very hard or abrasive materials, e.g., concrete containing reinforcing rebar, <b>laser</b> <b>welded</b> diamond blades should also be used with adequate water. Otherwise, it is possible for the diamond segment itself to break or the steel core below the segment to wear and break, creating serious safety hazards.|$|E

50|$|Silver brazed and <b>laser</b> <b>welded</b> diamond blades do {{not have}} this {{weakness}} because their diamond segments and steel core are treated separately.

50|$|Diamond hole saws {{are also}} called diamond core drill bits. <b>Laser</b> <b>welded</b> diamond core drill bits {{can be used}} in wet and dry drilling, but not all {{materials}} to be drilled are suitable for dry drilling. Very hard materials like reinforced concrete normally should be drilled with water, otherwise the excessive heat generated during the drilling process may cause the diamonds on the core bit to become blunt, and then lead to poor drilling performance.|$|E
50|$|Wet or dry cutting. Though {{diamond saw}} blades for {{concrete}} are usually <b>laser</b> <b>welded,</b> they are normally designed for wet cutting because the concrete {{to be cut}} is often very hard or abrasive. If the blades are used without adequate water, the diamond segment itself may break or the steel core below the segment may wear and break, and then the segment may fly out and may hurt the operator or people nearby. If you have to perform dry cutting for some reason (e.g. there is no water source near your work area), you can choose sharper diamond blades, and the dry cutting should be intermittent and shallow (you can do several passes of shallow cuttings to gain a deep cut) to keep the diamond blade cool.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Laser</b> <b>welding</b> {{is known}} for its low heat input {{compared}} to arc welding methods. This could enable <b>laser</b> <b>welding</b> of sheet metals with lighter fastening solutions and less time-consuming tack welding alternatives. A feasibility study was carried out to study four different corner joint types for 2 mm thick cold-rolled steel sheet by using filler-free <b>laser</b> <b>welding.</b> The aim of the research was to get more experimental knowledge about the <b>laser</b> <b>welding</b> of corner joints.

The 170 mm long joints were welded without air gap or pressing. All corner joint types proved to be weldable with a continuous wave Yb:YAG diode-pumped disk laser. It was also found during the experiment that <b>laser</b> <b>welding</b> enables the use of light and inexpensive fasteners such as magnetic holders instead of traditional clamps and fixturing. With some joint types, the insufficient fastening power of magnetic fasteners against distortions was compensated by making a spot-like <b>laser</b> tack <b>weld</b> {{at the end of the}} weld before welding the actual seam.
