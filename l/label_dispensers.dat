50|$|Patents on Manual <b>label</b> <b>dispensers</b> {{go back to}} the 1920s. They are {{designed}} for light-duty use. They are operated by hand and are not automated, but still assist in the process of removing labels from their liners. Many manual <b>label</b> <b>dispensers</b> can dispense multiple rolls at once. Operation is performed by pulling the liner/backing paper around a plate or bar which causes the label to peel away from the backing paper. This happens because the backing paper is usually thinner than the label itself and is also underneath. When the liner is forced around a tight radius the label lifts away and protrudes through the front or top of the dispenser.|$|E
50|$|<b>Label</b> <b>dispensers</b> and label applicators are {{machines}} {{built to}} simplify the process of removing a label from its liner or backing tape. Some are bench-top for dispensing the labels while others include {{the application of the}} label to the item (such as a package).|$|E
5000|$|Motor: The motor automates the <b>label</b> <b>dispenser</b> and {{controls}} {{the speed at}} which labels are dispensed.|$|R
5000|$|Photodetector or Limit switch: Used {{to trigger}} label advancement. Every {{semi-automatic}} <b>label</b> <b>dispenser</b> {{is equipped with}} one or the other. These detect the absence or presence of a label to facilitate dispensing.|$|R
50|$|Stickers {{are very}} widely used when an object {{requires}} with {{a word or}} idea. Brand stickers may be attached to products to label these products as coming from a certain company. They may {{also be used to}} describe characteristics of the products that would not be obvious from simple examination. A <b>label</b> <b>dispenser</b> is often used as a convenient way to separate the sticky label from its liner or backing tape.|$|R
50|$|<b>Label</b> <b>dispensers</b> are {{generally}} intended to dispense a label to an operator who manually applies the label to the package. They {{are designed with}} varying sizes and features which are often specific {{to the type of}} label they can dispense and to the degree of automation desired.|$|E
50|$|<b>Label</b> <b>dispensers</b> {{have many}} uses. Imagine how many items you {{purchase}} have labels, almost everything. Those labels were either applied by a machine or by hand, {{and most likely}} were peeled from the backing paper using some sort of label dispenser. Some {{of the more popular}} are bulk mailing, manufacturing, packaging, food and beverage, fast food, photo labs, and more.|$|E
50|$|The {{return address}} {{has been used}} on U. S. postage since the 1880s. As {{pressure}} printing became more commonplace during the early 1900s, labels became cheaper and more easily distributed. The profession involved with producing these labels was known as lithography. During the 1950s in the United States, more and more mail was not arriving at intended recipients, {{and as a result}} of the lack of a return address, said mail ended up in the dead letter office. With this rise in dead mail, the post office pleaded for people to use a return address. Even after this, the public still tended to neglect adding a return address. This prompted the postmaster to inform the public that mail without a return address would be less of a priority than mail with a return address. Still, the public did not widely use a return address until the 1960s when companies began to offer deals for preprinted return labels such as 2,500 labels for $2.00. They became more popular with the invention of <b>label</b> <b>dispensers.</b> With the invention of the personal computer, software enabled people to print their own labels. As e-mail began to overtake written mail, the return address became automatic in an e-mail.|$|E
50|$|Labels may be {{supplied}} separately or {{on a roll}} or sheet. Many labels are pre-printed by the manufacturer. Others have printing applied manually or automatically {{at the time of}} application. Specialized high speed label printer applicators may be used to apply labels to packages; these and other methods may be subject to recognized standards. Some labels have protective overcoats, laminates, or tape to cover them after the final print is applied. This is sometimes before application and sometimes after. Labels are often difficult to peel and apply. A <b>label</b> <b>dispenser</b> can speed up this task.|$|R
5000|$|Feed-Roller: This {{actually}} {{is the first}} patented method used in the semi-automatic <b>label</b> <b>dispenser</b> to advance the label forward. The label material is fed over the peeling edge, then through a feed-roller assembly which pinches the label material between a metal roller and a rubber roller. The metal roller is held in place with bushings pressed into aluminum blocks which hinge on a rod supported between two sideframes. The blocks use springs on each side to hold tension against the rubber roller (driven by a motor), and this also holds the tracking of the label material {{to the side of}} the machine with the sensor. Using this method label stock up to 16" [...] width can be advanced and tracked perfectly. The disadvantage/advantage to this method is waste is not collected, but pushed out through the rear of the machine where it can be fed into a trash receptacle.|$|R

Caution: Always be sure that containers are in correct locations as indicated. This is very important., 3. Fill with ice to top of juice containers. This will require approximately eighty pounds of ice. Always keep well filled with ice to secure best results. Do not turn water into dispenser until initial icino has been made. Caution!

5000|$|Electric Semi-automatic <b>label</b> <b>dispensers</b> {{were first}} {{patented}} {{in the early}} 1970s. They were originally designed for multiple-row address labels for bulk mailing houses. On average a good mailing house employee could apply approximately 500 labels per hour to envelopes. The label dispenser increased this to over 2,000 per hour. These dispensers advance individual or multiple-row labels and remove them from their lining similar to a manual dispenser, but instead of manually pulling on the liner, label advancement occurs when a trigger on the dispenser detects {{the absence of a}} label, such as when the operator removes the label. The sensor then closes the circuit and engages the motor, dispensing the next label until the sensor once again detects the label which opens the circuit.The first electric dispenser was designed with the limit switch on the left of a 16" [...] wide machine. 4-up multiple-row labels were loaded into the machine and once activated would advance one row of labels. The operator would take the labels from right to left, so that when the leftmost label was taken, the next row advanced, automatically providing a constant supply of labels to apply. The labels are also peeled without the natural curl that will happen when pulled from the backing paper with fingers. Also, only one hand was needed to take the label, the other hand could be used to move the material the label was being applied to.|$|E
