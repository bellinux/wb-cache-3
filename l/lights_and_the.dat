5|$|Like many Elizabethan mansions, Barrington {{is built}} in an 'E' shape with large {{projecting}} wings with square projections that contain staircases. The {{house is not}} truly symmetrical as the hall has two <b>lights</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> buttery one. The south front has seven gables supported by octagonal buttresses and decorated with twisted finials with ogee scale-work caps and English Crockets.|$|E

5|$|The Apollonio Stadium {{was used}} for select games of the ice hockey tournament. Considerable work {{had to be done}} to bring the stadium up to date. A second rink was added to allow for two games to be held simultaneously.

5|$|The Savoy Hotel, {{designed}} by the architect Thomas Edward Collcutt, opened in 1889. Financed by profits from The Mikado, {{it was the first}} hotel lit by electric <b>lights</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> first with electric lifts. In the 1890s, under its famous manager, César Ritz, and chef Auguste Escoffier, it became a well-known luxury hotel and would generate more income and contribute more to the D'Oyly Carte fortunes than any other enterprise, including the opera companies. Carte later acquired and refurbished Claridge's (1893), The Grand Hotel in Rome (1896), Simpson's-in-the-Strand (1898) and The Berkeley (1900).|$|E
5|$|The primary {{types of}} visual {{signalling}} were Semaphore flags, lamps and flags, lamps and <b>lights,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> heliograph. In open warfare, visual signalling (employing signal flags and the heliograph) was the norm. A competent signaller could transmit 12 {{words a minute}} with signal flags (during daylight) and signal lights (at night). Signal lights, which were secured in a wooden case, employed a battery-operated Morse code key. These signalling techniques had certain disadvantages, however. In trench warfare, operators using these methods were forced to expose themselves to enemy fire; while messages sent to the rear by signal lights could not be seen by enemy forces, replies to such messages were readily spotted, and operators were, once again, exposed to enemy fire.|$|E

5|$|Briarcliff Manor's fire company {{existed for}} more than a year before Briarcliff Manor's incorporation. Frederick C. Messinger (a fireman in Kingston for ten years) and {{thirteen}} local men founded the private fire company in 1901. Thirty-six men became the company's charter members on March 4, 1902, and dues were set at 25cents per month. On April 15 of that year, the company took the name Briarcliff Steamer Company No. 1. The company's first equipment was a 1901 hand-drawn chemical apparatus, with a tank containing a mixture of water and sodium bicarbonate. Sulfuric acid would be added to the tank, creating carbon dioxide, which would propel the solution through the hose and help extinguish the fire. That first apparatus was white, which Messinger thought more visible than the conventional red in a village without street <b>lights,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> village's engines remain white.|$|E
5|$|Pigozzi {{maintained}} {{a schedule of}} year-to-year model revisions, much like US manufacturers. For 1956, an estate version called the Simca Vedette Marly joined the line-up and the whole range was revised. A new license plate holder {{was added to the}} front bumper and the rear license plate now concealed the fuel tank filler. A peculiar addition was a pedal-operated windscreen washer, while other more ordinary changes included a second odometer, also known as a 'trip meter', for measuring partial distances. The Versailles and Régence were made even more comfortable with the addition of central armrests (Versailles in the rear only, Régence in front and rear), while the Trianon was simplified, losing bumper guards and chrome windscreen decor. In 1957, an option of the Gravina automatic clutch was added, along with better brakes and more direct steering. The Trianon regained the chrome decor around the windscreen, while the other models acquired slimmer tail <b>lights</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> front ornament was replaced with a new design. Fender-mounted V8 badges were introduced but, although the whole range featured the same V8 engine, the new badges appeared on the fenders of only the Régence and Marly.|$|E
5|$|The {{content is}} divided into 14 chapters. The first chapter serves as an {{introduction}} and considers the mythological and geological origin of night. The next 12 chapters are each titled after an hour starting with chapter 2's 6 pm and ending with chapter 13's 5 am. Chapter 2 discusses the transition into night, including sunsets, the green flash, the stages of twilight, as well as Olbers' paradox, and a definition of the size and speed of night. The 7 pm chapter deals with nature at night, how animals see and hear differently at night {{with a focus on}} bats, nighthawks, and nocturnal insects. The 8 pm chapter analyzes children's literature and bedtime stories. The 9 pm chapter discusses aspects of the city at night, including the evolution of nightclubs, street <b>lights,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> impacts of light pollution. The 10 pm chapter discusses night festivals around the world and throughout history. The 11 pm chapter explains the circadian rhythm and the physiology of sleep and dreams.|$|E

25|$|The First Great Awakening divided Congregationalists {{into the}} pro-revival New <b>Lights</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> anti-revival Old Lights (who were {{themselves}} divided between tradtional, Old Calvinists and liberal Calvinists who leaned toward Arminianism).

25|$|Philip Pullman's fantasy series, His Dark Materials, {{is seen as}} a {{response}} to The Chronicles.

In another parallel, the first books in each series – Pullman's Northern <b>Lights</b> <b>and</b> <b>The</b> Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe – both open with a young girl hiding in a wardrobe.|$|E

Penned by Osamu Shikado, the V30's design is much rounder {{when compared to the}} V20 series. Sedans purge the V20's six-window greenhouse for a four-part setup with integrated window sashes. Up front, the sedan's curved headlamps converge with a slimline grille insert; hardtops get a thinner front assembly with narrower <b>lights,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> C-pillar is raked more sharply. Base cars gain full body-colour coding of peripheral exterior components.|$|E
