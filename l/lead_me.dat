500|$|In 1876, Director of the Mint Henry Linderman began {{efforts to}} {{redesign}} the nation's silver coins. Linderman contacted C.W. Fremantle, Deputy Master of the Royal Mint in London, requesting him to [...] "find a first class die-sinker {{who would be}} willing to take the position of Assistant Engraver at the Mint at Philadelphia." [...] In response to Linderman's request, Fremantle wrote [...] "My inquiries as to an Assistant Engraver <b>lead</b> <b>me</b> very strongly to recommend for the post Mr. George Morgan, age 30, who has made himself a considerable name, but for whom there is not much opening at present in this country." [...] An agreement was reached between Linderman and Morgan for the engraver to work at the Philadelphia Mint under Chief Engraver William Barber on a six-month trial basis.|$|E
500|$|Williams {{sings the}} lead vocals while Beyoncé and Rowland sing their {{respective}} solo verses {{and serve as}} background vocalists throughout the song. Eric Corpus from The Christian Post interpreted the song's lyrics as a praise of God's sovereignty and [...] "magnetism" [...] of Jesus' love. [...] "Say Yes" [...] opens with a message of faith as Williams sings the first lines, [...] "I'm not worried about a thing/'Cause I know you are guiding me / Where you <b>lead</b> <b>me</b> / Lord I will go / I have not fear / 'Cause I know who's in control." [...] The chorus is constructed as a call and response with the trio repeatedly praising Jesus through the lines [...] "When Jesus say yes, nobody can say no!" [...] while being backed by a choir which repeats the verses.|$|E
500|$|A peace {{agreement}} of ten years was concluded between the Muslims and Quraysh of Mecca at the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah in 628. It {{has been recorded}} that Muhammad told Khalid's brother, Walid bin Walid, that: [...] "A man like Khalid, can't keep himself away from Islam for long". Walid wrote letters to Khalid persuading him to convert. Khalid, who was not unduly drawn towards the idols of the Kaaba, decided to convert to Islam and {{is said to have}} shared this matter with his childhood friend Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl who opposed him. Khalid was threatened by Abu Sufyan ibn Harb with dire consequences, but was restrained by Ikrimah who is reported to have said: [...] "Steady, O Abu Sufyan! Your anger may well <b>lead</b> <b>me</b> also to join Muhammad. Khalid is free to follow whatever religion he chooses".|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Mi Chico Latino" [...] {{was directed by}} Doug Nichol and filmed in Sardinia from 5-8 July 1999. Halliwell wanted the video for the song to be very different in style to her previous single [...] "Look At Me", as that one was filmed in Prague in the freezing cold, and she wanted something to connect with her fans. According to her, the video was also pretty easy to get: [...] "a yacht, {{a girl in a}} bikini and some sexy boy dancers to keep both sets of fans [...] happy". After the video was released, the singer got a huge amount of attention from it. [...] "People {{came up to me and}} told me how great and how sexy it was. They also told me I looked really healthy, but how wrong they were. I wasn't healthy because I wasn't eating properly and although I was slim at the time, that was a mirage too because the tough regime of the diet was always going to <b>lead</b> <b>me</b> to binge and put the weight back on", and later, she began taking recovery meetings for bulimia.|$|E
500|$|In November 2004 it was {{announced}} that Leslie Grantham had not renewed his contract and that Den Watts would depart EastEnders in what was described by The Mirror as an [...] "explosive" [...] and final exit. The storyline became one of [...] "the program's biggest and most high-profile narratives", dominating the entire year, and made the character of Chrissie Watts the [...] "centrepiece" [...] of the show. The lead-up to the 20th anniversary episode in February was an immensely high-profile affair, with Imogen Ridgway and Richard Godwin of the Evening Standard dryly observing that [...] "unless you've been living on Titan you probably know that EastEnders is 20 years old and Dirty Den is once again leaving Albert Square." [...] Events in the show centre around Chrissie manipulating Sam Mitchell and Zoe Slater in a plot of revenge against Den, the three women being dubbed the [...] "Witches of Walford" [...] by the popular press in reference to Shakespeare's play, Macbeth. The prelude to Den's death further highlighted and showcased Chrissie's manipulative character and conniving personality in her representation as a [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "forceful" [...] figure. When she secretly learns that Zoe is pregnant by Den, she plays on Zoe's insecurities and vulnerabilities and [...] "coerces" [...] her into having an abortion. The pregnancy represented a double blow to Chrissie as Den had always resisted having children with her, and as with Kate Mitchell, Chrissie determines to teach Zoe a harsh lesson about [...] "messing with other people's husbands". The possessive nature of his wife was noted by Den, who warns Zoe that Chrissie [...] "tends to blame the women that <b>lead</b> <b>me</b> astray." ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>Lead</b> <b>Me</b> On (1988) {{contained}} many {{songs that}} were about Christianity and love relationships, but some interpreted it {{as not being}} an obviously [...] "Christian" [...] record. Years later, <b>Lead</b> <b>Me</b> On would be chosen as the greatest Contemporary Christian album of all time by CCM Magazine. The mainstream song [...] "Saved by Love" [...] was a minor hit, receiving airplay on radio stations featuring the newly emerging Adult Contemporary format. The album's title song received some pop radio airplay and crossed over to No. 96 on the Billboard Hot 100, and [...] "1974 (We Were Young)" [...] and [...] "Saved By Love" [...] also charted as Adult Contemporary songs. In 1989, she appeared in a Target ad campaign, performing songs off the album.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Rats in the Walls" [...] is loosely {{connected}} to Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos stories; toward the end, the narrator {{notes that the}} rats seem [...] "determined to <b>lead</b> <b>me</b> on even unto those grinning caverns of earth's centre where Nyarlathotep, the mad faceless god, howls blindly to the piping of two amorphous idiot flute-players." [...] In this reference to Nyarlathotep, the first after his introduction in the prose poem of the same name, the entity seems to have many of the attributes of the god Azathoth.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} part of Girard's career, there seemed no place for {{beneficial}} imitation. Jean-Michel Oughourlian objected that [...] "imitation can be totally peaceful and beneficial; I don't believe that I am the other, I don't want to take [...] his place [...] This imitation can <b>lead</b> <b>me</b> to become sensitive to social and political problems." [...] Rebecca Adams argued that because Girard's theories fixated on violence, he was creating a 'scapegoat' himself with his own theory: the scapegoat of positive mimesis. [...] Adams proposed a reassessment of Girard's theory that includes an account of loving mimesis or, as she preferred to call it, creative mimesis.|$|E

2500|$|In 1957, Coltrane had a {{religious}} experience {{that may have}} helped him overcome the heroin addiction and alcoholism he had struggled with since 1948. In the liner notes of A Love Supreme, Coltrane states that, in 1957, [...] "I experienced, {{by the grace of}} God, a spiritual awakening which was to <b>lead</b> <b>me</b> to a richer, fuller, more productive life. At that time, in gratitude, I humbly asked to be given the means and privilege to make others happy through music." [...] The liner notes appear to mention God in a Universalist sense, and do not advocate one religion over another. Further evidence of this universal view regarding spirituality {{can be found in the}} liner notes of Meditations (1965), in which Coltrane declares, [...] "I believe in all religions." ...|$|E
2500|$|... to [...] "unveil his eyes." [...] Alter {{concluded}} that the story insists that God is the exclusive source of vision. Alter also noted reiterated phrase-motifs bearing on blessings and curses. In [...] Balak sent for Balaam to curse Israel believing that [...] "Whom you bless is blessed and whom you curse is cursed." [...] In [...] God set matters straight using the same two verb-stems: [...] "You shall not curse the people, for it is blessed." [...] In [...] Balaam concluded: [...] "From Aram did Balak <b>lead</b> <b>me</b> [...] [...] [...] : ‘Go, curse me Jacob, and go, doom Israel.’ What can I curse that El has not cursed, and what can I doom that the Lord has not doomed?" [...] Alter observed that Balaam was a poet {{as well as a}} seer, and taught that the story ultimately addresses whether language confers or confirms blessings and curses, and what the source of language's power is.|$|E

She made her debut as a teenager, and gained fame in Christian music during the 1980s with such hits as [...] "Father's Eyes", [...] "El Shaddai", and [...] "Angels". In the mid-1980s, she began broadening her audience and soon {{became one of the}} first CCM artists to cross over into mainstream pop on the heels of her successful albums Unguarded and <b>Lead</b> <b>Me</b> On. In 1986, she scored her first Billboard Hot 100 No.1 song in a duet with Peter Cetera, [...] "The Next Time I Fall". In 1991, she released the blockbuster album Heart in Motion which became her best-selling album to date, topping the Billboard Christian album chart for 32 weeks, selling five million copies in the U.S., and producing her second No.1 pop single [...] "Baby Baby". She is the author of several books, including a memoir, , and a book based on the popular Christmas song Breath of Heaven (Mary's Song) which she co-wrote.|$|E
