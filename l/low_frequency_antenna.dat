They then extended their research over deeper water beyond the Continental Shelf. Clay also conducted a geophysical survey of the Extremely <b>Low</b> <b>Frequency</b> <b>antenna</b> array in northern Wisconsin that was used for communication with ships anywhere on Earth.

Medwin. These two books have appeared in Russian translations and are the international standard references for marine acoustics. Clay also published a textbook for exploration seismology (1990). In 1993, the Acoustical Society of America recognized Clay’s preeminence by awarding him its Silver Medal, “for contributions to understanding acoustic propagation in layered waveguides, scattering from the ocean's boundaries and marine life, and ocean parameters and processes”.|$|E

30|$|The depth {{that can}} be {{investigated}} by GPR {{is related to the}} antenna frequencies. The lower the frequency, the deeper the radar wave penetrates. Both low and high antenna frequencies have different advantages and disadvantages. For shallow surveying, <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>antenna</b> of approximately 100  MHz are appropriate to acquire data from less than 2  m depth to about 15  m depth with satisfactory resolution. At a higher frequency (> 400  MHz) the depth of penetration is limited to < 2  m but the resolution is quite remarkable [13]. The size of high frequency antennas are relatively small and can be shielded from unwanted electromagnetic energy, whereas it is impractical to shield lower frequency antennas due to their larger dimensions. Although the unshielded GPR system is more difficult to work with, it still has advantages over the shielded system in collecting data for velocity analysis or conducting a common mid-point survey (a standard practice for stacking reflection data in the field).|$|E

40|$|Rock mass is {{typically}} characterized by inherent fractures that cause natural blocks of rocks. Unplanned cutting of stone deposits in quarries {{may lead to}} over-producing waste (rock debris) or extracting unfit (fractured) stone blocks. This paper presents two case studies {{through the use of}} low and high frequency Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) antennas to detect fractures in two benches of a quarry. In the first case study, a high frequency GPR antenna was used aiming to: (i) compare the GPR results with a map of the out-cropping fracture intensity in the bench surface, developed using the data of the GPR survey marks and interpolated by the Ordinary Kriging technique, and (ii) present how sub-vertical fractures can be numerically modelled in three dimensions from the GPR results.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{integration of}} antennas and active electronics manufactured {{on the same}} substrate. The main topic is on-chip antennas for commercial silicon processes, but hybrid integration using printed circuit board technology is also addressed. The possible use of micromachining techniques {{as a means of}} reducing substrate losses of antennas manufactured on low resistivity silicon wafers is investigated. Compact dipole, loop, and inverted-F antennas for the 20 - 40 GHz frequency range are designed, implemented, and characterized. The results show significantly improved antenna efficiency when micromachining is used as a post-processing step for on-chip antennas manufactured in silicon technology. High resistivity wafers are used in a commercial silicon germanium technology to improve the efficiency of dipole antennas realized using the available circuit metal layers in the process. Monolithically integrated 24 GHz receivers with on-chip antennas are designed and evaluated with regard to antenna and system performance. No noticeable degradation of the receiver performance caused by cross talk between the antenna and the integrated circuit is observed. For <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>antenna</b> arrays, such as base station antennas, hybrid integration of active devices within the antenna aperture is treated. A compact varactor based phase shifter for traveling wave antenna applications is proposed and evaluated.

40|$|The {{period between}} the {{creation}} of the cosmic microwave background at a redshift of ~ 1000 and the formation of the first stars and black holes that re-ionize the intergalactic medium at redshifts of 10 - 20 is currently unobservable. The baryonic component of the universe during this period is almost entirely neutral hydrogen, which falls into local regions of higher dark matter density. This seeds the formation of large-scale structures including the cosmic web that we see today in the filamentary distribution of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. The only detectable signal from these dark ages is the 21 -cm spectral line of hydrogen, redshifted down to frequencies of approximately 10 - 100 MHz. Space-based observations of this signal will allow us to determine the formation epoch and physics of the first sources of ionizing radiation, and potentially detect evidence for the decay of dark matter particles. JPL is developing deployable <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>antenna</b> and receiver prototypes to enable both all-sky spectral measurements of neutral hydrogen and ultimately to map the spatial distribution of the signal as a function of redshift. Such observations must be done from space because of Earth's ionosphere and ubiquitous radio interference. A specific application of these technologies is the Dark Ages Radio Explorer (DARE) mission. This small Explorer class mission is designed to measure the sky-averaged hydrogen signal from the shielded region above {{the far side of the}} Moon. These data will complement ground-based radio observations of the final stages of intergalactic re-ionization at higher frequencies. DARE will also serve as a scientific percursor for space-based interferometry missions to image the distribution of hydrogen during the cosmic dark ages. Comment: 2015 IEEE Aerospace Conferenc...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{full wave}} {{electromagnetic}} {{modeling and simulation}} tools allows for accurate performance predictions of unique RF structures that exhibit multi-dimensional scales. Full wave simulation tools need to cover {{the broad range of}} frequency including RF and terahertz bands that is focused as RF technology is developed. In this dissertation, three structures with multi-dimensional scales and different operating frequency ranges are modeled and simulated. The first structure involves nanostructured solar cells. The silicon solar cell design is interesting research to cover terahertz frequency range in terms of the economic and environmental aspects. Two unique solar cell surfaces, nanowire and branched nanowire are modeled and simulated. The surface of nanowire is modeled with two full wave simulators and the results are well-matched to the reference results. This dissertation compares and contrasts the simulators and their suitability for extensive simulation studies. Nanostructured Si cells have large and small dimensional scales and the material characteristics of Si change rapidly over the solar spectrum. The second structure is a reconfigurable four element antenna array antenna operating at 60 GHz for wireless communications between computing cores in high performance computing systems. The array is reconfigurable, provides improved transmission gain between cores, and can be used to create a more failure resilient computing system. The on-chip antenna array involves modeling the design of a specially designed ground plane that acts as an artificial magnetic conductor. The work involves modeling antennas in a complex computing environment. The third structure is a unique collar integrated zig-zag antenna that operates at 154. 5 MHz for use as a ground link in a GPS based location system for wildlife tracking. In this problem, an intricate antenna is modeled in the proximity of an animal. Besides placing a <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>antenna</b> in a constricted area (the collar), the antenna performance near the large animal body must also be considered.

40|$|CubeSats {{have been}} under {{intensive}} investigation {{for the last decade}} or so. The concept of constellations has emerged in response to increasing CubeSat capabilities, especially in altitude and positioning control. A constellation will most likely consist of CubeSats distributed across a finite planar region parallel to the earth’s surface, perhaps a few hundred metres or a kilometre across (depending on numbers). Besides spreading the risks and the costs of a mission, constellations can be far larger from edge to edge than the arms of even the largest conventional satellites (typically a handful of metres). For example, the OLFAR (Orbiting Low Frequency Array) mission is designed for radio astronomy observation below 30 MHz. At those low frequencies, large aperture of over 10 km is a must to achieve required spatial resolution, operating as a distributed aperture synthesis array. High-data rate communication is key for the success of such a configuration. The 60 GHz band provides 12 GHz of bandwidth for inter-satellite communication (59 GHz to 71 GHz). Yet the communication system must respect the mechanical and electrical requirements of the Cubesat platform, such as the tradeoff between radio power and communication distance. We will first describe the design and simulation of a very low profile antenna package including two 60 GHz Bull’s eye antennas and a <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>antenna</b> for channel control tasks. We previously experimentally demonstrated an individual Bull’s eye antenna with good agreement to simulated results. In our double antenna design, we expect to obtain 4. 7 GHz of bandwidth, a moderately high gain of 18 dBi and a high efficiency (95 %), using two orthogonal polarisations for the transmit and receive antennas. Each antenna is fixed as transmit or receive only, due to the 60 GHz chipset that is currently available to us. This antenna package is completed by an omnidirectional 2. 4 GHz-modified Planar Inverted F Antenna (PIFA) suitable for a reliable low-data-rate link over which channel management data can be sent. The full antenna package is readily integrable onto a 0. 5 U face of a CubeSat with a total thickness of 6. 4 mm.
