The real money for the investors was in supplying electric power to new communities and in developing and selling real estate. To get the railways and electricity to their towns, local groups offered the Huntington interests opportunities in local land.

Massachusetts Bay had conquered Block Island in 1636 in retaliation for the murder of a trader {{at the start of the}} Pequot War, and Massachusetts families settled there in 1661.

50|$|The Hedgcoxe War of 1852, {{also known}} as the Peters colony rebellion, was an armed {{uprising}} of Texas colonists protesting what they viewed as an attempt by the Peters Colony <b>land</b> <b>company</b> to invalidate their land claims. From its inception the colony had been embroiled in controversy regarding the terms of agreement between the <b>land</b> <b>company</b> and the settlers. On February 10, 1852, the state legislature, in an attempt to satisfy both the colonists and the <b>land</b> <b>company,</b> passed a compromise law. According to its terms all lawsuits between the <b>land</b> <b>company</b> and the state were to be withdrawn, the colonists were to be given new guidelines and extended time for filing their claims, and the state was to give the <b>land</b> <b>company</b> 1088000 acre of land. But the colonists, concerned over the possible sale of some claims and angered over the legislature's generosity towards the <b>land</b> <b>company,</b> continued their protest and demanded that the law be repealed.|$|R
25|$|Settlement policy, set by {{the federal}} government, the Canadian Pacific Railway, the Hudson's Bay Company and {{associated}} <b>land</b> <b>companies</b> encouraged immigration. The key event was the decision to emulate the American Homestead Law by offering, at no cost, 160 acres of farmland to any man over 18 (or to a woman head of family) who settled there. Dramatic advertising campaigns promoted the benefits of prairie living. Potential immigrants read leaflets information painted Canada as a veritable garden of Eden, and downplayed the need for agricultural expertise. Ads in The Nor'-West Farmer by the Commissioner of Immigration implied that western land was blessed with water, wood, gold, silver, iron, copper, and cheap coal for fuel, {{all of which were}} readily at hand. Reality was far harsher, especially for the first arrivals who lived in sod houses. However eastern money poured in and by 1913, long term mortgage loans to Saskatchewan farmers had reached $65 million.|$|E

[...] Disston founded the town of Tarpon Springs, much of which was built by Lake Butler Villa Company, including a commercial pier and two hotels, using lumber from his sawmill in Atlantic City, New Jersey. [...] After deciding that Tarpon Springs would not become the metropolis he hoped for, Disston shifted his efforts south and established a town he called Disston City. [...] He invested heavily in steamboats and built a wharf, a school, and the area's first hotel. [...] In 1885, a Maryland doctor declared the area to be the healthiest in the world which drew many investors and developers including F. A.

2500|$|Mackenzie {{frequently}} {{complained about}} {{the manner in which}} members of the Family Compact utilized their official positions for monetary gain, especially through corporations such as the Bank of Upper Canada, and the two <b>land</b> <b>companies</b> (the Clergy Corporation and the Canada Company) that between them controlled two sevenths of all the land in the province. The Bank of Upper Canada, for example, had been founded by William Allan and the Rev. John Strachan, key members of the Family Compact, both of whom were Executive and Legislative Councillors. Although they lacked the minimum capital needed to found the bank, they persuaded the government to subscribe for a quarter of its shares. During the 1830s, a third of the bank's board were Legislative or Executive Councillors, and the remaining all magistrates. Despite repeated attempts, the elected Legislature - which had chartered the bank - could obtain no details about the bank's workings. [...] Mackenzie saw the bank as a prop of the Government and demanded farmers withdraw their support from it, by withdrawing their specie. [...] The small confidence in the security which most banks gave for their redemption of their issues and the managers refusal to answer reasonable questions put forth by the House resulted in public confidence plummeting. Mackenzie was attempting to drain the banks of their money as a political weapon against the Government in hopes to avoid an armed revolution. However, the bank rebounded from this attack, making this attempt at peaceful revolution a failure.|$|E

6000|$|Pedrito Montero {{saw in the}} {{elevation}} of his brother the road wide open to his wildest imaginings. This was what made the Monterist pronunciamiento so unpreventable. The general himself probably could have been bought off, pacified with flatteries, despatched on a diplomatic mission to Europe. It was his brother who had egged him on from first to last. He wanted {{to become the most}} brilliant statesman of South America. He did not desire supreme power. He would have been afraid of its labour and risk, in fact. Before all, Pedrito Montero, taught by his European experience, meant to acquire a serious fortune for himself. With this object in view he obtained from his brother, on the very morrow of the successful battle, the permission to push on over the mountains and take possession of Sulaco. Sulaco was the land of future prosperity, the chosen land of material progress, the only province in the Republic of interest to European capitalists. Pedrito Montero, following the example of the Duc de Morny, meant to have his share of this prosperity. This is what he meant literally. Now his brother was master of the country, whether as President, Dictator, or even as Emperor--why not as an Emperor?--he meant to demand a share in every enterprise--in railways, in mines, in sugar estates, in cotton mills, in <b>land</b> <b>companies,</b> in each and every undertaking--as the price of his protection. The desire to be on the spot early was the real cause of the celebrated ride over the mountains with some two hundred llaneros, an enterprise of which the dangers had not appeared at first clearly to his impatience. Coming from a series of victories, {{it seemed to him that}} a Montero had only to appear to be master of the situation. This illusion had betrayed him into a rashness of which he was becoming aware. As he rode at the head of his llaneros he regretted that there were so few of them. The enthusiasm of the populace reassured him. They yelled [...] "Viva Montero! Viva Pedrito!" [...] In order to make them still more enthusiastic, and from the natural pleasure he had in dissembling, he dropped the reins on his horse's neck, and with a tremendous effect of familiarity and confidence slipped his hands under the arms of Senores Fuentes and Gamacho. In that posture, with a ragged town mozo holding his horse by the bridle, he rode triumphantly across the Plaza to the door of the Intendencia. Its old gloomy walls seemed to shake in the acclamations that rent the air and covered the crashing peals of the cathedral bells.|$|E
