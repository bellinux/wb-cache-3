40|$|Abstract One of {{the crucial}} steps in image {{processing}} is the thresholding, meaning the image segmentation needed to separate the foreground (canopy) from the background (sky). Due to the plethora of factors affecting image grey levels (lens vignetting, gamma correction, heterogeneity of sky irradiance, etc.), with current thresholding procedures the estimation of canopy gap fraction is rather uncertain. Both manual and automatic segmentation methods are highly dependent on exposure, operator experience or assumptions of thresholding algorithms, and therefore produce rather subjective and non-repeatable results. However, since CCD and CMOS sensors used in digital cameras respond linearly to light, it is nowadays possible to obtain images in which digital numbers are proportional to canopy brightness. For this purpose the standard in-camera logarithmic conversion (gamma correction) has to be replaced with a <b>linear</b> <b>conversion</b> of the sensor analog signal. In this work, {{the potential of the}} <b>linear</b> <b>conversion</b> of digital images in the estimation of canopy gap fraction is assessed and discussed, comparing the estimates obtained with digital cameras and with the LI-COR LAI- 2000. In addition, the performance of the <b>linear</b> <b>conversion</b> is compared with standard automatic or manual thresholding methods, both in terms of canopy gap fraction and of plant architectural parameters. The ability to acquire hemispherical photographs with digital numbers proportional to radiance opens new possibilities in the analysis of canopy structure and microclimate, with important feedbacks in ecology and remote sensing. In particular, using two synchronized cameras above and below the canopy, it is possible to calculate high-resolution gap fraction data, which provide an accurate and objective estimation of the intercepted radiation and of typical architectural parameters, such as LAI. In addition, the effectiveness of this methodology for the estimation of linear and logarithmic averages of canopy gap fraction, makes this technique an important step forward in the estimation of leaf area index of non-random canopies.

40|$|Abstract. Previous {{experiments}} at the Large Plasma Device (LAPD) at UCLA {{provide evidence}} that whistler waves incident on a field-aligned density striation will produce lower hybrid waves via a linear mode-coupling mechanism [Bamber, et. al, 1994; Bamber, et. al, 1995]. These experiments were limited in that only the magnetic fields of the waves were measured. Recent experiments at the LAPD directly measure the whistler and lower hybrid wave electric fields.

40|$|<b>Linear</b> mode <b>conversion</b> of Langmuir {{waves to}} {{radiation}} near the plasma frequency at density gradients is potentially relevant to multiple solar radio emissions, ionospheric radar experiments, laboratory plasma devices, and pulsars. Here we study mode conversion in warm magnetized plasmas using a numerical electron fluid simulation code with the density gradient {{parallel to the}} ambient magnetic field B 0 {{for a range of}} incident Langmuir wavevectors. Our results include: (1) Both o- and x-mode waves are produced for Ω ∝ (ωL) 1 / 3 (ωc/ω) somewhat less than 1, contrary to previous ideas. Only o mode is produced for Ω and somewhat greater than 1. 5. Here ωc is the (angular) electron cyclotron frequency, ω the angular wave frequency, and L the length scale of the (linear) density gradient. (2) In the unmagnetized limit, equal amounts of o- and x-mode radiation are produced. (3) The mode conversion window narrows as Ω increases. (4) As Ω increases the total electromagnetic field changes from linear to circular polarization, with the o- and x- mode signals remaining circularly polarized. (5) The conversion efficiency to the x mode decreases monotonically as Ω increases while the o-mode conversion efficiency oscillates due to an interference phenomenon between incoming and reflected Langmuir/z modes. (6) The total conversion efficiency for wave energy from the Langmuir/z mode to radiation is typically less than 10 %, but the corresponding power efficiencies differ by the ratio of the group speeds for each mode and are of order 50 − 70 %. (7) The interference effect and the disappearance of the x mode at Ω somewhat greater than 1 can be accounted for semiquantitatively using a WKB-like analysis. (8) Constraints on density turbulence are developed for the x mode to be generated and be able to propagate from the source. (9) Standard parameters for the corona and the solar wind near 1 AU suggest that <b>linear</b> mode <b>conversion</b> should produce both o- and x- mode radiation for solar and interplanetary radio bursts.
