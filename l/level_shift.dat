We propose two <b>level</b> <b>shifting</b> circuits that reduce problems that exist in complementary <b>level</b> <b>shifting</b> circuits described previously. Using HSPICE parameters of a 0. 35 um CMOS process, simulations have been performed under various capacitive loading and operating conditions. The simulation results show that our design method can achieve 16. 6 % low-to-high propagation delay decrease and 27. 2 % low-to-high power delay product improvement when converting 3. 3 V to 5 V compared with conventional <b>level</b> <b>shifting</b> circuits. In addition, as the working voltages being converted are reduced, the design yields still greater advantage without degrading circuit performance...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I analyse {{the effects of}} {{ignoring}} <b>level</b> <b>shifts</b> in the data generating process (DGP) on systems cointegration tests that do not accommodate <b>level</b> <b>shifts.</b> I consider two groups of Likelihood Ratio tests based on procedures suggested by Johansen (1988, 1995) and Saikkonen & L (2000 b). The Monte Carlo analysis reveals that ignoring <b>level</b> <b>shifts</b> reduces the tests' sizes to zero and causes an important drop in the small sample power for increasing shift magnitudes. These observations are also reflected in two empirical applications {{in such a way}} that the tests find a cointegrating rank smaller than one suggested by procedures which accommodate the shifts...|$|R
40|$|We study {{alternative}} {{models for}} capturing abrupt structural changes (<b>level</b> <b>shifts)</b> in a times series. The problem is confounded {{by the presence}} of transient outliers. We compare the performance of non-Gaussian time-varying parameter models and multiprocess mixture models within a Monte Carlo experimental setup. Our findings suggest that once we incorporate shocks with thick-tailed probability distributions, the superiority of the multiprocess mixture models over the time-varying parameter models, reported in an earlier study, disappears. The behavior of the two models, both in adapting to <b>level</b> <b>shifts</b> and in reacting to transient outliers, is very similar. time-varying parameter (TVP) models, non-Gaussian state space models, multiprocess mixture models, <b>level</b> <b>shifts,</b> outliers...|$|R

It may however be that empirical evidence for long memory {{is caused by}} neglecting one or more <b>level</b> <b>shifts.</b> Since such <b>level</b> <b>shifts</b> are not unlikely for inflation, where the shifts {{may be caused by}} sudden oil price shocks, we examine whether evidence for long memory (indicated by the relevance of an ARFIMA model) in G 7 inflation rates is spurious or exaggerated.

30|$|A new {{approach}} {{was developed by}} Monfared and Steiner (2000) to deal with <b>level</b> <b>shifts</b> in time series. The idea behind the {{new approach}} was to turn the infinite-horizon SES method into a finite-horizon one. The new method was implemented on an automated scheduling and control manufacturing system when the random order stream faces <b>level</b> <b>shifts</b> (Monfared and Yang 2005). It was shown that the new finite-horizon SES method could outperform the traditional one in dealing with non-stationary <b>level</b> <b>shifts.</b> In fact, the finite version of SES generalizes the traditional infinite one {{in a sense that}} it can easily be extended to the infinite one in the absence of <b>level</b> <b>shifts.</b> Monfared and Yang (2004) further developed the finite version of SES method by performing a sensitivity analysis on the smoothing parameters. It was shown that the number of observations which enters the forecasting process influences the accuracy of predictions. However, no mechanism was proposed to calculate the size of the observations which should be taken into the forecasting process in an adaptive manner.|$|R

40|$|Consider a {{time series}} model which is {{stationary}} {{apart from a}} single shift in mean. If the time of a <b>level</b> <b>shift</b> is known, the least squares estimator {{of the magnitude of}} this <b>level</b> <b>shift</b> is a minimum variance unbiased estimator. If the time is unknown, however, this estimator is biased. Here, we first carry out extensive simulation studies to determine the relationship between the bias and three parameters of our time series model: the true magnitude of the <b>level</b> <b>shift,</b> the true time point and the autocorrelation of adjacent observations. Thereafter, we use two generalized additive models to generalize the simulation results. Finally, we examine to what extent the bias can be reduced by multiplying the least squares estimator with a shrinkage factor. Our results showed that the bias of the estimated magnitude of the <b>level</b> <b>shift</b> can be reduced when the <b>level</b> <b>shift</b> does not occur close to the beginning or end of the time series. However, {{it was not possible to}} simultaneously reduce the bias for all possible time points and magnitudes of the <b>level</b> <b>shift...</b>|$|E
30|$|A <b>level</b> <b>shift</b> is {{perceived}} better as more observations are seen out-of-control limits, i.e., as n is increasing. However, {{even a single}} out-of- control limit observation can signal a true <b>level</b> <b>shift</b> with a certainty factor of p(B|A′). In other words, with probability 1 −p(B|A′), such a single observation could {{be associated with a}} spike or an outlier and not a true <b>level</b> <b>shift.</b> Thus, our certainty factor improves as more out-of-control limit data are seen (i.e. as n increases), causing the probability p(B|A′) to increase.|$|E
40|$|Photoelectron core level {{spectroscopy}} {{is commonly}} used to monitor atomic and molecular adsorption on metal surfaces.

Here, density functional theory calculations {{have been used to}} systematically evaluate core <b>level</b> <b>shifts</b> for (111) and (100) surfaces of 3 d, 4 d, and 5 d transition metals upon CO, H, O and S adsorption.

The approach combines ideas from the FastLTS algorithm for robust regression with alternating least squares.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has found that processes with occasional structural breaks could be hardly distinguished from long memory ones because the memory properties may spuriously arise in model with <b>level</b> <b>shifts.</b> In this paper, we investigate if a long memory model will provide good forecasts even if the real DGP is affected by <b>level</b> <b>shifts</b> (as suggested by Diebold and Inoue, 2001).

To cope with this uncertainty, we assign a confidence level equal to 1 −α to our perceived <b>level</b> <b>shift</b> event in which α is the Type I error, i.e., the error that seeing an out-of-control value such as a spike or an outlier confuses with a <b>level</b> <b>shift.</b> Also, we introduce the shift arising probability as a new measure of uncertainty and launch the shift change process according to this uncertainty measure as will be considered in the following.|$|E

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} forecasting time series that are subject to <b>level</b> <b>shifts.</b> Processes with <b>level</b> <b>shifts</b> possess a nonlinear dependence structure. Using the stochastic permanent breaks (STOPBREAK) model, I model this nonlinearity in a direct and flexible way that avoids imposing a discrete regime structure. I apply this model to the rate of price inflation in the United States, which I show is subject to <b>level</b> <b>shifts.</b> These shifts significantly affect the accuracy of out-of-sample forecasts, causing models that assume covariance stationarity to be substantially biased. Models that do not assume covariance stationarity, such as the random walk, are unbiased but lack precision in periods without shifts. I show that the STOPBREAK model outperforms several alternative models in an out-of-sample inflation forecasting experiment. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R

The distributions depend on a Brown-ian motion and a Poisson-type jump process. The latter is related to the occurrence of <b>level</b> <b>shifts,</b> and induces for tests based on standard critical values power losses increasing rapidly with the number and the magnitude of the shifts. A new approach to unit root testing is suggested which does not require to know either the location or the number of <b>level</b> <b>shifts.</b> It is proposed to remove possible shifts from a time series by weighting each of its increments according to how likely it is, with respect to an ad hoc postulated distribution, a shift to have occurred in the respective period.
