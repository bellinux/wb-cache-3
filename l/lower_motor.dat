5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve carries <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> neurons that synapse with {{upper motor neurons}} at the hypoglossal nucleus. Symptoms related to damage {{will depend on the}} position of damage in this pathway. If the damage is to the nerve itself (a <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> neuron lesion), the tongue will curve toward the damaged side, owing to weakness of the genioglossus muscle of affected side. If the damage is to the nerve pathway (an upper motor neuron lesion) the tongue will curve away from the side of damage, due to action of the affected genioglossus muscle, and will occur without fasciculations or wasting, with speech difficulties more evident. Damage to the hypoglossal nucleus will lead to wasting of muscles of the tongue and deviation towards the affected side when it is stuck out. This is because of the weaker genioglossal muscle.|$|E

40|$|Introduction and Aim: Epidural {{analgesia}} is {{an effective}} technique for postoperative pain relief following thoracoabdominal surgeries. <b>Lower</b> limb <b>motor</b> weakness is a well-known complication of epidural analgesia with local anesthetics and delays postoperative rehabilitation. Our aim in conducting this observational study {{was to assess the}} frequency of <b>lower</b> limb <b>motor</b> weakness in patients receiving epidural analgesia following upper abdominal surgery and the factors associated with it. Materials and Methods: All adult patients, aged 20 - 70 years, who underwent upper abdominal surgery and received postoperative analgesia with an epidural infusion of bupivacaine with fentanyl, were included. Data were collected over 4 months from notes entered by acute pain service after each round. Data collected included level of epidural placement, drug solution and volume, degree of <b>lower</b> limb <b>motor</b> weakness and measures taken to relieve it. Bromage scale was used to assess motor weakness. Results: Data were collected on 123 patients. Bupivacaine 0. 1 % with fentanyl 2 mg/mL was used in 113 (92 %) patients. <b>Lower</b> limb <b>motor</b> weakness developed in 45 patients (36. 5 %). The highest frequency was seen in patients with epidural at L 2 -L 3 level. The common management steps were a change of patient′s position or decrease in concentration of local anesthetic. These measures produced improvement in 39 (87 %) patients whereas the local anesthetic was stopped temporarily in the remaining six patients. Conclusion: <b>Lower</b> limb <b>motor</b> weakness occurred in 36. 5 % patients. It was more common with a lumbar epidural. It was successfully managed in all patients.

5|$|Gross {{movement}} – such as locomotion and {{the movement}} of arms and legs – is generated in the motor cortex, divided into three parts: the primary motor cortex, found in the prefrontal gyrus and has sections dedicated to the movement of different body parts. These movements are supported and regulated by two other areas, lying anterior to the primary motor cortex: the premotor area and the supplementary motor area. The hands and mouth have a much larger area dedicated to them than other body parts, allowing finer movement; this has been visualised in a motor cortical homunculus. Impulses generated from the motor cortex travel along the corticospinal tract along the front of the medulla and cross over (decussate) at the medullary pyramids. These then travel down the spinal cord, with most connecting to interneurons, in turn connecting to <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> neurons within the grey matter that then transmit the impulse to move to muscles themselves. The cerebellum and basal ganglia, play a role in fine, complex and coordinated muscle movements. Connections between the cortex and the basal ganglia control muscle tone, posture and movement initiation, and are referred to as the extrapyramidal system.|$|E

Subjects: First time onset of stroke with mean post-stroke duration of 6. 41 days, able to respond to verbal instructions, and Brunnstrom recovery stage 2 and above were enrolled. Intervention: Mirror therapy group performed 30 minutes of functional synergy movements of non-paretic lower extremity, whereas control group underwent sham therapy with similar duration. In addition, both groups were administered with conventional stroke rehabilitation regime. Altogether 90 minutes therapy session per day, six days a week, for two weeks duration was administered to both groups. Outcome Measures: <b>Lower</b> extremity <b>motor</b> subscale of Fugl Meyer Assessment (FMA), Brunnel Balance Assessment (BBA) and Functional Ambulation Categories (FAC).

40|$|Objective. Gait {{performance}} is {{an indicator of}} mobility impairment after stroke. This study evaluated changes in balance, <b>lower</b> extremity <b>motor</b> function, and spatiotemporal gait parameters after receiving body weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT) and conventional overground walking training (CT) in patients with subacute stroke using 3 D motion analysis. Setting. Inpatient department of rehabilitation medicine at a university-affiliated hospital. Participants. 24 subjects with unilateral hemiplegia in the subacute stage were randomized to the BWSTT (n= 12) and CT (n= 12) groups. Parameters were compared between the two groups. Data from twelve age matched healthy subjects were recorded as reference. Interventions. Patients received gait training with BWSTT or CT {{for an average of}} 30 minutes/day, 5 days/week, for 3 weeks. Main Outcome Measures. Balance was measured by the Brunel balance assessment. <b>Lower</b> extremity <b>motor</b> function was evaluated by the Fugl-Meyer assessment scale.

40|$|There {{is limited}} {{understanding}} of potential mechanisms underpinning postural control deficits {{in people with}} neck pain. This study examined several characteristics that might explain impaired postural stability {{in a group of}} older adults with neck pain, and compared the results in this cohort with that of asymptomatic controls. In this cross-sectional study we compared physical activity, <b>lower</b> limb <b>motor</b> and sensory function, vestibular and visual function, falls efficacy and dizziness handicap in 84 older adults with (n = 35, age 69. 6 ± 6. 3) and without (n = 49, age 69. 4 ± 4. 7) idiopathic neck-pain. Additionally, dynamic balance was assessed using the dynamic gait index (DGI) and standard and wavelet analysis of static balance was computed after data capture. Physical activity levels, <b>lower</b> limb <b>motor</b> and sensory function, vestibular function and visual contrast sensitivity were not different between groups (p > 0. 05). The neck-pain group demonstrated higher falls efficacy (p = 0. 01), greater levels of dizziness handicap (p < 0. 01), and higher CoP velocity measures in the moderate (1. 56 – 6. 25 Hz) and low (0. 39 – 1. 56 Hz) frequency bandwidths. Our results suggest that neck-pain induced postural control deficits in older adults may not be associated with the physical activity levels, <b>lower</b> limb <b>motor</b> and sensory function, or vestibular and visual function.

Symptoms of <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> neuron degeneration include muscle weakness and atrophy, muscle cramps, and fleeting twitches of muscles {{that can be}} seen under the skin (fasciculations) although twitching is not a diagnostic symptom and more of a side effect so twitching would either occur after or accompany weakness and atrophy.|$|E
40|$|Muscular {{strength}} and power generating ability decline with advancing age. Older adults adapt their <b>lower</b> limb <b>motor</b> patterns {{to cope with}} these declines in muscle function. When mechanical demands approach limits of lower limb muscular capacity, motor patterns must be adapted to produce a desired movement. The term “motor pattern” is used to broadly represent the kinematic and kinetic profile of a person accomplishing a given task. Generally, these adaptations involve higher reliance on stronger proximal muscles to compensate for limitations or weakness of distal muscles. Three studies were conducted to examine factors affecting differences between older and young adults in lower extremity mechanics for walking and cycling. In the first two studies, the effects of physical activity status, walking speed, and step length on <b>lower</b> extremity <b>motor</b> patterns of older and young adults were examined. As walking speed and step length increased, lower extremity muscular effort, as reflected by joint moments and power, increased. Differences in motor patterns between older and young participants, were preserved for multiple speed and step length conditions. In general, older adults showed higher reliance on hip musculature to compensate for lower muscle strength of plantarflexors. Moreover, sedentary and older groups, who had lower leg strength, exhibited similar <b>lower</b> limb <b>motor</b> patterns during walking. Likewise, physically active and young participants, who had higher lower extremity strength, displayed similar <b>lower</b> limb <b>motor</b> patterns. Consistent with the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, {{these results suggest that}} adopting and maintaining a physically active life-style can help maintain walking abilities in older adults. When cycling at a submaximal intensities, both older and young participants showed higher reliance on muscles about the knee and had higher rates of energy cost for higher power outputs and cadences. Older adults had higher rates of energy cost and higher co-activation of thigh antagonistic muscles during cycling than young adults. The higher antagonist co-activation likely contributes to older adults higher energy cost. Considering all study outcomes, differences in motor patterns used by older and young adults were more apparent for walking than cycling. The less prominent age-related differences in cycling are likely related to its non-weight bearing characteristic, heavier reliance on hip and knee muscular effort, and the kinematically constrained nature of the cycling task...|$|R

Current-smokers were also characterized by a <b>lower</b> off UPDRS-III <b>motor</b> score. A logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, disease duration, Hoehn and Yahr staging, and medication indicated a significant lower [123 I]FP–CIT uptake {{not only in the}} putamen (odds ratio, 0. 1; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 01 to 0. 65; P = 0. 02) but also in the caudate (odds ratio, 0. 2; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 04 to 0. 71; P = 0. 015) as well as a <b>lower</b> UPDRS-III <b>motor</b> score (odds ratio, 0. 9; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 81 to 0. 99; P = 0. 04) in current-smokers.

On rare instances, these lesions can acutely hemorrhage, leading to sudden neurological decline. To date, there are only 16 reported cases of intradural capillary hemangiomas in the cauda equina. Case Description: We report a case of an intradural extramedullary cauda equina capillary hemangioma that resulted in back pain and <b>lower</b> extremity <b>motor</b> deficit. Initial magnetic resonance (MR) imaging demonstrated a bilobular intradural L 3 - 4 cauda equina lesion.

Methods A total of 60 stroke patients (duration < 6 months) accepted conventional rehabilitation training combined with body weight support treadmill training (BWSTT group, N = 30) or conventional rehabilitation training combined with lower limb rehabilitation robot training (Robot group, N = 30). Fugl - Meyer Assessment Scale for Lower Extremity (FMA-LE) {{was used to evaluate}} <b>lower</b> limb <b>motor</b> function. Berg Balance Scale (BBS) was used to evaluate balance function. Lower limb rehabilitation robot torque feedback system was used to evaluate lower limb muscle strength.

40|$|Stroke is {{the leading}} cause of serious and {{long-term}} disabilities in developed countries. Of those who survive a stroke, common disabilities are upper and <b>lower</b> extremity <b>motor</b> deficits. Despite intensive training programs, stroke survivors regularly show deterioration of motor function during or after their rehabilitation period. In order to explain any functional progress or decline of motor function, information on body movements performed during daily life is necessary. However, regularly used standardized lab-based systems for the evaluation of body movements are not suitable for measurements of body movements in a daily life setting. Within the international project: ‘INTERACTION’ a wearable sensing system is developed for the ambulatory monitoring and assessment of upper and <b>lower</b> extremity <b>motor</b> performance. The final version of the system consists of multiple sensors integrated in clothing and shoes. Challenging in monitoring body movements in a daily life setting over a longer period of time, is the complexity and the amount of data such a system generates. The main goal of this dissertation therefore was to develop clinically relevant metrics for the ambulatory assessment of stroke survivors' quality of upper and <b>lower</b> extremity <b>motor</b> performance, using wearable sensors. The newly developed data analysis processes enable the assessment of motor performance on a level of body function during functional tasks in a daily life setting. Furthermore, data processing methods are proposed to present all measured data into concise functional reports. The automatically generated reports make it more feasible for the health care professional to evaluate large sets of movement data. In future, these reports may be used to objectively describe any progress or deterioration in motor performance and optimize individual rehabilitation processes. The presented methods are not limited to the evaluation of motor performance in stroke survivors, but could also be used in other clinical cases to objectively evaluate motor performance...|$|R
