5000|$|... ===United States context=== Before 1909 {{there were}} only 100 <b>Leavers</b> <b>machines</b> in the United States. Importing them was prohibitively {{expensive}} due to a 45% import tarif. The US lost many soldiers to malaria in a squirmish in Spanish America, and need for mosquito netting was seen. The US Tarif Act of 1909 provided free entry for <b>Leavers</b> <b>machines,</b> during a 19 month window from 6 August 1909 to 31 December 1910. Thus by 1947 there were 730 machines in 54 mills employing 5000 people.|$|R

The design on the digitally printed fabric was taken from a collage composed of an image of me taken by the museum body scanner and elements of the <b>Leavers</b> lace making <b>machines.</b> It {{was made into a}} 3 D anaglyph viewable with 3 D glasses. A cut-up poem made about the lace machines was transformed into a soundtrack to accompany a 3 D lightbox image of the ‘Lace Trance’ collage...|$|R
40|$|One lone mill in Rhode Island {{stands as}} a {{reminder}} of a once prosperous machine-made lace industry in the United States. The leavers lace industry saw a rapid growth and an even quicker decline in the twentieth century. If this mill closes, the knowhow in the United States to produce excellent imitations of hand-made lace disappears. This study gives a brief history of the leavers lace industry along with a detailed account of how this lace was used in women 2 ̆ 7 s fashions from 1940 to 1969, the period of greatest domestic production. An additional manuscript addresses repairing damage in leavers laces, a topic virtually ignored in the literature. ^ The first manuscript entitled 2 ̆ 2 History of Leavers Lace and Its Incorporation in American Fashion: 1940 – 19692 ̆ 2 explores the development of the most complicated machinery in the textile industry, its introduction into the United States, and domestic lace production, particularly in Rhode Island. City directories yielded the names and locations of Rhode Island lace manufacturers. In addition, advertisements from the Providence Journal, dress patterns, and actual garments reflect how American designers and seamstresses incorporated lace yardage and trimmings in garments. ^ Before World War II, lace was a popular fabric choice in women 2 ̆ 7 s fashion. During the war, the use of lace dwindled, but did not entirely disappear because production of rayon lace was not regulated. The post-war era into the 1950 s saw a growth in the popularity of lace not only as decorative trims, but also as lace yardage for women 2 ̆ 7 s evening and social attire. With the heightened demand, mills expanded, and investors built new mills with more <b>leavers</b> <b>machines</b> than ever before in America. Major fashion changes and a growing youth market in the 1960 s caused a sharp decrease in demand for lace yardage, and many mills closed. Lace lost its prestige and became a fabric reserved almost exclusively for women and wedding attire. ^ The second manuscript 2 ̆ 2 Repair of Twentieth-Century Leavers Lace 2 ̆ 2 details a procedure for repairing this machine-made lace. A microscopic examination of twentieth-century leavers laces in garments and yardage from the University of Rhode Island Historic Textile and Costume Collection plus garments found in local vintage clothing stores revealed how yarns in the manufactured laces interact and facilitated reproducing their movements. Drawings and photocopies of both large- and small-scale laces aided in developing repair techniques that incorporate an adhesive to stabilize broken yarns and stitches to replace missing connections. This process is very time intensive, and practice is essential, although the time required for an effective repair shortens with experience. Finding suitable yarns for repairs is a major hurdle, but with patience, time, and a steady hand, the mesh and patterns in damaged machine-made lace can be stabilized and repaired. ...|$|R

5000|$|Most lace {{machines}} {{stem from}} the weft-knitting Stocking frame. The <b>Leavers</b> <b>machine</b> is a derivative of Heathcoat's 1809 Old Loughborough. The <b>Leavers</b> <b>machine</b> was invented by John Levers,(sic) a framesmith and setter-up of Sutton-in-Ashfield. Sources give the date as either 1813 or 1814, and the location as Derby Road, Nottingham. Patent applications up until 1930, spelled the name without an 'a', but about 1906, foreign sources had started to insert an 'a'. The Lace working party of 1946 standardised the name with an 'a' and the trade association henceforth adopted that spelling.|$|E

40|$|Projet CRYSALIS, Cité Internationale de la Dentelle et de la Mode, ‘Soundlace’ a {{commission}} from the Calais Lace Museum designed and created by BOUDICCA. An interactive dress and sound system installation that reacts to its environment {{and is in}} connection with people; that if worn would be triggered by sensors positioned down {{the centre of the}} body and on the wrists and arms. The contract has for object the creation of a textile piece from lace created by the City of Calais, {{within the framework of the}} Crysalis project, produced on the International Center for Lace and Fashion Leavers’s loom. The CRYSALIS lace is the result of a cross-cultural approach merging the knowledge of historical hand-made lace pattern and new sources of inspiration. The lace refers to the Leavers loom for the pattern as well as Jacquard punch boards, the sound of the loom, and offers to play with materials. Today, after having created the pattern, punched the specific cardboards, prepared the <b>Leavers</b> lace <b>machine</b> n° 7 and carried out the corrective phase and furthers tests on different materials, the lace is being produced for future partnership creations. The first dyed piece of lace is now available and the International Centre for Lace and Fashion (CIDM) wish to value it with an artistic partnership. This piece will be presented at the CRYSALIS final event in Ronse, on the 27 th of September 2014. For that purpose, the International Center for Lace and Fashion appeals to Boudicca Couture...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Leavers</b> <b>machine</b> is {{probably}} the most versatile of all machines for making patterned lace. A 120 in machine will weigh 17 tons and have 40,000 moving parts and carry between 12,000 and 50,000 threads. Working widths are always multiples of 9 in since the web is calculated in quarter yards.|$|E
50|$|The {{bobbinet}} {{was best}} producing straight net, but the Pusher {{was slow and}} {{could be used to}} imitate handlace of any complexity though could't put in liners leaving the impression of sharpness from the lace. When in William IV reign, tatting and putting on fancies became popular, the Pusher was in great demand. The pusher was particularly good at making large shawls or capes in the style of Chantilly lace. It could replicate the grille or half-stitch which defeated the <b>Leavers</b> <b>machine.</b> It could be hand lined using a Cornely machine.|$|E
5000|$|In 1855 Redgate {{combined}} {{the principles of}} a circular loom with those of warp knit. A German firm used this machine to produce [...] "Raschel" [...] shawls, named after the French actress Élisabeth Félice Rachel. In 1859 Wilhelm Barfuss improved the machine to create the Raschel machines. The Jacquard apparatus was adapted {{to it in the}} 1870s. The Raschel machine could work at higher speeds than the <b>Leavers</b> <b>machine</b> and proved the most adaptable to the new synthetic fibres, such as nylon and polyester, in the 1950s. Most contemporary machine-made lace is made on Raschel machines.|$|E
50|$|The frame {{viewed from}} the front is similar to <b>Leavers</b> <b>machine.</b> Its action is {{different}} as it produces a square net rather than a hexagonal one. The Nottingham lace curtain machine only has one warp and the patterning threads are carried on a spools not on a beam. The terms to describe the actions {{are the same as}} those used for a Leavers machine: rise, fall, right, left, sley, carriage, comb et c. The lace is collected at the top, unlike the Pusher machine where it is at the bottom, It is collected on a take up beam; a spiky roller called the porcupine beneath it, regulated the take up tension.|$|E
