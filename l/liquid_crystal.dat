5000|$|The {{columnar}} phase is {{a class of}} mesophases in which molecules assemble into cylindrical structures to act as mesogens. Originally, these kinds of <b>liquid</b> <b>crystals</b> were called discotic <b>liquid</b> <b>crystals</b> or bowlic <b>liquid</b> <b>crystals</b> [...] because the columnar structures are composed of flat-shaped discotic or bowl-shaped molecules stacked one-dimensionally. Since recent findings provide a number of columnar <b>liquid</b> <b>crystals</b> consisting of non-discoid mesogens, it is more common now to classify this state of matter and compounds with these properties as columnar <b>liquid</b> <b>crystals.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{the absence}} of an {{external}} field, the director of a <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> is free to point in any direction. It is possible, however, to force the director to point in a specific direction by introducing an outside agent to the system. For example, when a thin polymer coating (usually a polyimide) is spread on a glass substrate and rubbed in a single direction with a cloth, it is observed that <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> molecules in contact with that surface align with the rubbing direction. The currently accepted mechanism for this is believed to be an epitaxial growth of the <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> layers on the partially aligned polymer chains in the near surface layers of the polyimide.|$|E
5|$|<b>Liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> {{materials}} {{became a}} focus {{of research in the}} development of flat panel electronic displays beginning in 1962 at RCA Laboratories. When physical chemist Richard Williams applied an electric field to a thin layer of a nematic <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> at 125°C, he observed the formation of a regular pattern that he called domains (now known as Williams Domains). This led his colleague George H. Heilmeier to perform research on a liquid crystal-based flat panel display to replace the cathode ray vacuum tube used in televisions. But the para-Azoxyanisole that Williams and Heilmeier used exhibits the nematic <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> state only above 116°C, which made it impractical to use in a commercial display product. A material that could be operated at room temperature was clearly needed.|$|E

40|$|The {{connection}} between the compressible flow of <b>liquid</b> <b>crystals</b> with low Mach number and the incompressible flow of <b>liquid</b> <b>crystals</b> is studied in a bounded domain. In particular, the convergence of weak solutions of the compressible flow of <b>liquid</b> <b>crystals</b> to the weak solutions of the incompressible flow of <b>liquid</b> <b>crystals</b> is proved when the Mach number approaches zero; that is, the incompressible limit is justified for weak solutions in a bounded domain...|$|R
5|$|Liquid {{crystals}} find wide use in <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> displays, which rely on {{the optical}} properties of certain liquid crystalline substances in {{the presence or absence}} of an electric field. In a typical device, a <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> layer (typically 4 μm thick) sits between two polarizers that are crossed (oriented at 90° to one another). The <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> alignment is chosen so that its relaxed phase is a twisted one (see Twisted nematic field effect). This twisted phase reorients light that has passed through the first polarizer, allowing its transmission through the second polarizer (and reflected back to the observer if a reflector is provided). The device thus appears transparent. When an electric field is applied to the LC layer, the long molecular axes tend to align parallel to the electric field thus gradually untwisting in the center of the <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> layer. In this state, the LC molecules do not reorient light, so the light polarized at the first polarizer is absorbed at the second polarizer, and the device loses transparency with increasing voltage. In this way, the electric field can be used to make a pixel switch between transparent or opaque on command. Color LCD systems use the same technique, with color filters used to generate red, green, and blue pixels. Chiral smectic liquid crystals are used in ferroelectric LCDs which are fast-switching binary light modulators. Similar principles can be used to make other <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> based optical devices.|$|E

5|$|Scientists and {{engineers}} {{are able to}} use liquid crystals {{in a variety of}} applications because external perturbation can cause significant changes in the macroscopic properties of the <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> system. Both electric and magnetic fields can be used to induce these changes. The magnitude of the fields, as well as the speed at which the molecules align are important characteristics industry deals with. Special surface treatments can be used in <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> devices to force specific orientations of the director.|$|E
50|$|Columnar <b>liquid</b> <b>crystals</b> {{are grouped}} by their {{structural}} {{order and the}} ways of packing of the columns. Nematic columnar <b>liquid</b> <b>crystals</b> have no long-range order and are less organized than other columnar <b>liquid</b> <b>crystals.</b> Other columnar phases with long-range order are classified by their two-dimensional lattices: hexagonal, tetragonal, rectangular, and oblique phases.|$|R

50|$|For a polymer {{material}} with <b>liquid</b> <b>crystals,</b> the <b>liquid</b> <b>crystals</b> are molecules shaped like rigid rods.

At high temperatures, this alignment is disrupted and the material is said to be in the isotropic state. At lower temperatures, the alignment will take place and the <b>liquid</b> <b>crystals</b> are said to be in the pneumatic state Hoong.C.C.|$|R

5|$|The {{ordering}} of liquid crystalline phases is extensive on the molecular scale. This order extends {{up to the}} entire domain size, which {{may be on the}} order of micrometers, but usually does not extend to the macroscopic scale as often occurs in classical crystalline solids. However some techniques, {{such as the use of}} boundaries or an applied electric field, can be used to enforce a single ordered domain in a macroscopic <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> sample. The ordering in a <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> might extend along only one dimension, with the material being essentially disordered in the other two directions.|$|E
5|$|Anisotropy {{of liquid}} {{crystals}} is a property not observed in other fluids. This anisotropy makes flows of liquid crystals behave more differentially {{than those of}} ordinary fluids. For example, injection of a flux of a <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> between two close parallel plates (viscous fingering) causes orientation of the molecules to couple with the flow, with the resulting emergence of dendritic patterns. This anisotropy is also manifested in the interfacial energy (surface tension) between different <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> phases. This anisotropy determines the equilibrium shape at the coexistence temperature, and {{is so strong that}} usually facets appear. When temperature is changed one of the phases grows, forming different morphologies depending on the temperature change. Since growth is controlled by heat diffusion, anisotropy in thermal conductivity favors growth in specific directions, which has also an effect on the final shape.|$|E
40|$|Cholesteryl oleate <b>liquid</b> <b>crystals</b> were {{prepared}} by sonication {{as a model}} of lipid droplets accumulated in foam cells derived from macrophages. These <b>liquid</b> <b>crystals</b> were spherical and showed an anisotropic cross image. Hormone-sensitive lipase from bovine adipose tissue hydrolyzed these <b>liquid</b> <b>crystals</b> optimally at pH 6. 8. The Km for the <b>liquid</b> <b>crystals</b> was about 8 times that for vesicles or emulsified cholesteryl oleate. The Vmax for the <b>liquid</b> <b>crystals</b> was the same as that for the emulsified substrate and 6 times that for the vesicle substrate. Phospholipid inhibited cholesteryl oleate hydrolysis in a concentration-depen-dent fashion, phosphatidylserine being especially inhibitory. The effect of phospholipids on the activity changed upon their incorporation into the cholesteryl oleate <b>liquid</b> <b>crystals,</b> phosphatidylethanolamine increasing the activity to about twice that of the control. These results suggest that hormone-sensitive lipase hydrolyzes cholesteryl oleate <b>liquid</b> <b>crystals</b> {{as a model of}} endogenous lipid droplets and its activities are affected by phospholipids.

40|$|Dye doped <b>liquid</b> <b>crystals</b> show changed {{dielectric}} properties {{in comparison to}} pure <b>liquid</b> <b>crystals.</b> These changes are strongly dependent on the concentration of dye.

5|$|Liquid {{crystals}} (LCs) are {{matter in}} a state which has properties between those of conventional liquids and those of solid crystals. For instance, a <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> may flow like a liquid, but its molecules may be oriented in a crystal-like way. There are {{many different types of}} liquid-crystal phases, which can be distinguished by their different optical properties (such as birefringence). When viewed under a microscope using a polarized light source, different <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> phases will appear to have distinct textures. The contrasting areas in the textures correspond to domains where the liquid-crystal molecules are oriented in different directions. Within a domain, however, the molecules are well ordered.

Consider {{the case in}} which <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> molecules are aligned parallel {{to the surface and}} an electric field is applied perpendicular to the cell. At first, as the electric field increases in magnitude, no change in alignment occurs. However at a threshold magnitude of electric field, deformation occurs. Deformation occurs where the director changes its orientation from one molecule to the next. The occurrence of such a change from an aligned to a deformed state is called a Fredericks transition and can also be produced by the application of a magnetic field of sufficient strength.|$|E
