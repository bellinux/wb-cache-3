In War Room Players {{are put in}} maps wherein they must defeat enemies who are usually given an advantage at the start. Versus mode allows the players to use either a pre-existing map or a user-created map {{and set up a}} game with customized settings. Versus mode can be used to create games played against the computer AI or other players by using hotseat gameplay. Multiplayer games with more than one game console is possible with <b>Link</b> <b>mode,</b> and requires the use of a Game Boy Advance Game Link Cable.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Yersinia pestis {{chromosome}} {{contains a}} large variety {{and number of}} insert sequences that have resulted in frequent chromosome rearrangement events. To identify the chromosomal rearrangement features of Y. pestis strains from five typical plague foci in China and study spontaneous DNA rearrangements potentially stabilized in certain lineages of Y. pestis genomes, we examined the <b>linking</b> <b>mode</b> of locally collinear blocks (LCBs) in 30 Y. pestis strains by a polymerase chain reaction-based method. Our results suggest most strains have relatively stable chromosomal arrangement patterns, and these rearrangement characteristics also have a very {{close relationship with the}} geographical origin. In addition, some LCB <b>linking</b> <b>modes</b> are only present in specific strains. We conclude Y. pestis chromosome rearrangement patterns may reflect the genetic features of specific geographical areas and can be applied to distinguish Y. pestis isolates; furthermore, most of the rearrangement events are stable in certain lineages of Y. pestis genomes...|$|R

This is done to prevent image shifting that can occur if each channel is compressed individually. It becomes noticeable when a loud element that is panned to either edge of the stereo field raises the level of the program to the compressor's threshold, causing its image to shift {{toward the center of the}} stereo field.|$|R

Each channel uses a different subset of the propagating modes in the MMF.

Ca[BPO 5] and Sr[BPO 5] crystallize in the stillwellite structural type and contain tetrahedral chain anions math image[BPOmath image], which can be described as loop-branched “dreier” single chains. In Ba 3 [BP 3 O 12] the math imagetetrahedral anions form “zweifach” open “vierer” single chains.

In the field of "environmental valuation", nowadays colonised by economics, the approach of plural modes (or "regimes") of engagement provides a sociological understanding of the unequal power of conflicting "languages of valuation". This frame entails a shift from "values" to "modes of valuation" and <b>links</b> <b>modes</b> of valuation to modes of practical engagement and coordination with the surrounding environment. Different social sources of incommensurability are thus detected and reframed as critical tension within and among modes of human coordination with the environment...|$|R
