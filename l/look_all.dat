500|$|The {{graphics}} and THX-certified audio were lauded by critics. The game's animations, scenery, player models, cutscenes, music and voice acting were particularly well received. [...] "Sound effects {{used in the}} game will also blow you away," [...] Knutson said, [...] "Everything from the explosions, swords clashing, hundreds of incoming enemies storming your way, all sounds like it came directly from the movie!" [...] GameSpot's Greg Kasavin noted that [...] "Frame rate issues do affect each version of the game, to varying degrees, {{and none of the}} character models for the main characters <b>look</b> <b>all</b> that remarkable," [...] but conceded that [...] "all other aspects of The Return of the Kings graphics are outstanding [...] The game's audio is even more effective than the graphics at conveying the intensity of the action." [...] Ian McKellen's narration of the game as Gandalf was also praised.|$|E

500|$|Glee costume {{designer}} Lou Eyrich described Rachel's costuming {{in an interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Originally, the inspiration for her look was Tracy Flick from Election—very buttoned-down, preppy, obnoxious, squeaky clean, nerdy. But she's got at least 12 costume changes each episode. That same <b>look</b> <b>all</b> the time just gets boring for the screen and for the actress to wear, so we spread it out a lot. We try to have her buttoned-up or wearing a nerdy sweater over a cute dress, like she doesn't quite get it right. Or she takes that sweater and tucks it into the skirt and pairs it with knee highs and flats. She makes it her way, which is more quirky. The popular girls {{find a way to make}} it look cool, but Rachel makes it look nerdy. But it's not old-school nerdy with thick glasses and pocket protectors. She thinks she's taking a trend and making it cool, but she wears it wrong." ...|$|E

[...] In his junior year in 2000, he was a second-team All-American and first-team All-Conference USA, as he set school records by hitting three home runs in one game and 19 for the season; still, he went undrafted.

He looked chubby in a uniform. ... It wasn't fat. He was strong. [...] I think the body did scare some people away." ...|$|E
500|$|Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama {{gave the}} film {{a rating of}} 4 out of 5, calling it [...] "a must-see for its {{interpretation}} of modern-day romance...

[...] Daily News and Analysis gave it a rating of 3.5 out of 5, saying that it stood apart from [...] "other done-to-death rom-coms in Hindi cinema in the sheer exclusivity of its screenplay {{and the way the}} subject is developed ...
