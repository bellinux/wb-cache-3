50|$|The tapered key is tapered only on {{the side}} that engages the hub. The keyway in the hub has a taper that matches that of the tapered key. Some taper keys have a gib, or tab, for easier removal during disassembly. The purpose of the taper is to secure the key itself, as well as, to firmly engage the shaft to the hub {{without the need for}} a set screw. The problem with taper keys is that they can cause the center of the shaft {{rotation}} to be slightly off of the mating part. It is different from a tapered <b>shaft</b> <b>lock</b> in that tapered keys have a matching taper on the keyway, while tapered <b>shaft</b> <b>locks</b> do not.|$|R

40|$|All but the {{smallest}} classes of modern keelboats are fitted with inboard engines and consequently, when making way under sail, the craft experience parasitic drag due to trailing propellers and associated appendages. The variety of screw configurations used on sailing boats includes fixed-blade, feathering, and folding set-ups, with blades numbering two or three. Although {{the magnitude of}} the resultant drag is thought to have a significant influence on sailing performance, the published literature having regard to this problem is sparse. Here, the aim was to evaluate the drag effect of fixed-blade propellers of types commonly used on sailing craft. The results of towing tank tests on full-scale propellers are presented for the <b>locked</b> <b>shaft</b> condition; these are presented along with reconfigured data from the few previously published sources. For the case in which the propeller is allowed to rotate, tests were conducted on a typical screw with a range of braking torques being applied.

5000|$|Most modern manual-transmission {{vehicles}} are {{fitted with a}} synchronized gear box. Transmission gears are always in mesh and rotating, but gears on one shaft can freely rotate or be <b>locked</b> to the <b>shaft.</b> The <b>locking</b> mechanism for a gear consists of a collar (or dog collar) on the shaft which is able to slide sideways so that teeth (or dogs) on its inner surface bridge two circular rings with teeth on their outer circumference: one attached to the gear, one to the shaft hub. When the rings are bridged by the collar, that particular gear is rotationally <b>locked</b> to the <b>shaft</b> and determines the output speed of the transmission. The gearshift lever manipulates the collars using a set of linkages, so arranged so that one collar may be permitted to lock only one gear at any one time; when [...] "shifting gears", the locking collar from one gear is disengaged before that of another is engaged. One collar often serves for two gears; sliding in one direction selects one transmission speed, {{in the other direction}} selects another.|$|R
25|$|The {{two most}} common {{factory-installed}} locking differentials use either a computer-controlled multi-plate clutch or viscous coupling unit {{to join the}} shafts, while other differentials more commonly used on off-road vehicles generally use manually operated locking devices. In the multi-plate clutch the vehicle's computer senses slippage and <b>locks</b> the <b>shafts,</b> causing a small jolt when it activates, which can disturb the driver or cause additional traction loss. In the viscous coupling differentials the shear stress of high shaft speed differences causes a dilatant fluid in the differential to become solid, linking the two shafts. This design suffers from fluid degradation with age and from exponential locking behavior. Some designs use gearing to create a small rotational difference that hastens torque transfer.|$|R

5000|$|The slowest gears (designated '1' or low gear) in most {{automotive}} applications {{allow for}} three to four engine rotations for each output revolution (3:1).

50|$|A tapered lock {{is a form}} of keyless <b>shaft</b> <b>locking</b> {{device that}} does not require any {{material}} to be removed from the shaft. The basic idea is similar to a clamp coupling but the moment of rotation is closer {{to the center of the}} shaft. An alternative coupling device to the traditional parallel key, the tapered lock removes the possibility of play due to worn keyways. It is more robust than using a key because maintenance only requires one tool and the self-centering balanced rotation means it lasts longer than a keyed joint would, but the downside is that it costs more.|$|R

50|$|Like its W25 predecessor, the W125 used a 4-speed manual transmission. The gearbox {{design was}} changed to a {{constant}} mesh type, which provided better reliability compared to the sliding mesh transmission of the M25. In a constant mesh gearbox, the transmission gears are always in mesh and rotating, but the gears are not rigidly connected to the shafts on which they rotate. Instead, the gears can freely rotate or be <b>locked</b> to the <b>shaft</b> on which they are carried. The previous sliding mesh transmission required the gears to be spinning {{at roughly the same}} speed when engaged; otherwise, the teeth would refuse to mesh.|$|R
50|$|The {{most popular}} form found in {{automobiles}} is the hydraulic automatic transmission. Similar but larger devices {{are also used}} for heavy-duty commercial and industrial vehicles and equipment. This system uses a fluid coupling {{in place of a}} friction clutch, and accomplishes gear changes by hydraulically locking and unlocking a system of planetary gears. These systems have a defined set of gear ranges, often with a parking pawl that <b>locks</b> the output <b>shaft</b> of the transmission to keep the vehicle from rolling either forward or backward. Some machines with limited speed ranges or fixed engine speeds, such as some forklifts and lawn mowers, only use a torque converter to provide a variable gearing of the engine to the wheels.|$|R
50|$|<b>Locking</b> {{the output}} <b>shaft</b> with a gear is {{achieved}} {{by means of a}} dog clutch selector. The dog clutch is a sliding selector mechanism which is splined to the output shaft, meaning that its hub has teeth that fit into slots (splines) on the shaft, forcing that shaft to rotate with it. However, the splines allow the selector to move {{back and forth on the}} shaft, which happens when it is pushed by a selector fork that is linked to the gear lever. The fork does not rotate, so it is attached to a collar bearing on the selector. The selector is typically symmetric: it slides between two gears and has a synchromesh and teeth on each side in order to lock either gear to the shaft.|$|R

50|$|The {{main gearbox}} was located behind {{the cabin and}} {{connected}} to the engine clutch housing via a short cardan shaft (this design enables a so-called flat floor cabin.) The main gearbox was bolted to an auxiliary gearbox, to a transfer case {{and then to a}} backbone tube and formed main part of a chassis structure.

The new feature was unique 2-speed planetary overdrive system bolted between front and rear axles.The overdrive could only be selected manually whilst stationary. Auxiliary gearbox had a neutral position which allowed a winch and a power take off to use main gearbox gearing for variable speed operation.

The preloading force, produced during the tightening process, should be evaluated accurately, since it must <b>lock</b> safely the <b>shaft,</b> without overcoming the yielding point of the hub. Firstly, friction coefficients have been evaluated on “ad-hoc designed” specimens, by applying the Design of Experiment approach: the applied tightening torque has been precisely related to the imposed preloading force. Then, the tensile state of clamps have been evaluated both via FEM and by leveraging some design formulae proposed by the Authors as function of the preloading force and of the clamp geometry. Finally, the results have been compared to those given by some strain gauges applied on the tested clamps: the discrepancies between numerical analyses, the design formulae and the experimental results remains under a threshold of 10 %...|$|R
50|$|The Rothensee {{boat lift}} was {{originally}} envisaged {{as part of}} a larger project. The lift is at the Eastern end of the Mittellandkanal, it was intended that this canal would cross the Elbe on an aqueduct and then be connected to the Elbe-Havel Canal by a double boat lift at Hohenwarthe. The Rothensee lift is about 500m from the junction of the Elbeabstiegcanal and the MittellandKanal lowering boats to the level of the Elbe. The Rothensee lift was completed in 1938 but as a result of the Second World War the aqueduct and Hohenwarthe lift were not constructed. As part of a German re-unification transport project the Elbe aqueduct was completed after a 60 year delay, however two <b>shaft</b> <b>locks</b> were built instead of the proposed Hohenwarthe lift. For 60 years, therefore, the Rothensee lift, which was originally intended to allow passage just from the Mittellandkanal to the Elbe carried all the navigation traffic from the West German industrial centres to West Berlin.|$|R
40|$|When {{a vehicle}} with wheels aligned in pairs turn, the wheel {{traveling}} around {{the outside of the}} curve has to roll farther than the wheel on the inside. This means that some sort of device must must be used to allow the drive wheels to rotate at different speeds to prevent wear on the tires. This is usually a mechanical device where the input rotation controls the sum of the two output rotations, this is known as a differential. This solution however has some shortcomings, the biggest one is that the total amount of force that can be transferred between the tires and the road surface is limited by the tire with the least traction. In slippery conditions this can be a big problem since it only takes one wheel to lose traction in order to prevent the vehicle from accelerating. In this thesis a locking differential is used to overcome this shortcoming, this gives the driver the option to <b>lock</b> the <b>shafts</b> of the driving wheels together. This is done by pushing two cogwheels, one attached to each shaft, together. The aim of this thesis is to shorten the lock- and unlock-time of the locking differential by aligning the cogwheels using the service brakes and available sensors. The results were evaluated by implementing the software in a truck and doing test runs on Scanias test track. These tests showed that the system greatly improved both lock- and unlock-times but at cost of lower driver comfort. With additional work with some fine tuning of the system, the overall performance could probably be increased even more...|$|R
25|$|This {{new concept}} in lock design {{has yet to}} be {{installed}} on any waterway. It is basically a <b>shaft</b> <b>lock</b> with a diagonal shaft. The proposal is for a long tube of reinforced concrete, of a size to accommodate the boats being lifted, to be built on the slope between the upper and lower levels. The bottom of the tube is sealed with a strong watertight door, but there is a single pair of conventional lock gates at the top, installed a boat's length from the far wall of the tube.

40|$|The {{development}} of a leading edge propeller blade reconfiguration system using Shape Memory Allow (SMA) muscles is presented. This work describes the design and testing of a leading edge flap, {{which is used to}} alter the local camber of a propeller blade. The leading edge flap is deflected by SMA wires housed in the blade and maintained in a fixed position with a <b>shaft</b> <b>locking</b> and releasing mechanism. A locking and releasing mechanism is utilized so that constant actuation of the SMAs is not required to maintain leading edge deflection. The profile at 70 % span of the propeller blade was used to create a two-dimensional blade for leading edge flap design implementation and load testing. Deflection of up to five degrees was obtained with the final design of the leading edge flap and locking and releasing mechanism. The SMA muscles used to deflect the leading edge were actuated electronically through resistive heating and were controlled by a proportional/integral gain control algorithm with closed-loop feedback from a linear displacement sensor within the blade. With the final design of the leading edge flap and locking and releasing mechanism, a preliminary design for a three-dimensional propeller was created...|$|R
50|$|Park (P): This {{selection}} mechanically <b>locks</b> {{the output}} <b>shaft</b> of transmission, restricting the vehicle from moving in any direction. A parking pawl prevents the transmission from rotating, {{and therefore the}} vehicle from moving. However, the vehicle's non-driven wheels are still free to rotate, and the driven wheels may still rotate individually (because of the differential). For this reason, it is recommended to use the hand brake (parking brake) because this actually locks (in most cases) the wheels and prevents them from moving. It is typical of front-wheel-drive vehicles for the parking brake to lock the rear (non-driving) wheels, so use of both the parking brake and the transmission park lock provides the greatest security against unintended movement on slopes. This also increases {{the life of the}} transmission and the park pin mechanism, because parking on an incline with the transmission in park without the parking brake engaged will cause undue stress on the parking pin, and may even prevent the pin from releasing. A hand brake should also prevent the car from moving if a worn selector accidentally drops into reverse gear while idling.|$|R
