50|$|A parbaked <b>loaf</b> <b>of</b> semi-cooked {{bread is}} {{in a form}} that is {{relatively}} stable against aging. It can be transported easily, and stored until needed.

A parbaked loaf appears as a risen <b>loaf</b> <b>of</b> bread, with much of the firmness <b>of</b> a finished <b>loaf,</b> but without a browned or golden crust (in the case of a normally light colored bread). It does not age or become stale like a fully baked <b>loaf</b> <b>of</b> bread.|$|R

25|$|The ancient Greek {{custom of}} placing terra cotta miniatures of their {{furniture}} in children's graves {{gives us a}} good idea of its style and design. The Greeks normally ate while seated on chairs; benches were used for banquets. The tables, high for normal meals and low for banquets, were initially rectangular in shape. By the 4th century BC, the usual table was round, often with animal-shaped legs (for example lion's paws). <b>Loaves</b> <b>of</b> flat bread could be used as plates, but terra cotta bowls were more common.|$|E
25|$|A {{man from}} Baal-shalishah brought the prophet Elisha bread of the First Fruits — 20 <b>loaves</b> <b>of</b> barley — and fresh grain in his sack {{to give to}} the people to eat. Elisha's servant asked Elisha how he could feed a hundred men with these rations, but Elisha told his servant to give the food to the people, for God said that they would eat and have food left over. So the servant set the food before the men, they ate, and they had food left over, just as God had said.|$|E
25|$|One {{explanation}} for the Counting of the Omer is that it shows the connection between Passover and Shavuot. The physical freedom that the Hebrews achieved at the Exodus from Egypt {{was only the beginning}} of a process that climaxed with the spiritual freedom they gained at the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai. Another explanation is that the newborn nation which emerged after the Exodus needed time to learn their new responsibilities vis-a-vis Torah and mitzvot before accepting God's law. The distinction between the Omer offering—a measure of barley, typically animal fodder—and the Shavuot offering—two <b>loaves</b> <b>of</b> wheat bread, human food—symbolizes the transition process.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{plentiful}} resources, {{the country}} lacks sustainable pragmatic policies to combat poverty. Hania Sholkamy, an {{economist for the}} Social Research Center at the American University in Cairo, disclosed that although the government had subsidized 270 million <b>loaves</b> <b>of</b> bread/day at 19 Piasters/piece, 29 {{percent of the children}} in Egypt remained malnourished. Although these policies were adopted in an attempt to reduce economic burdens on the poor, they benefited the rich more which caused more problems to the poor and increased the burdens of the government. In fact, 83 percent of food subsidy, 76 percent of electricity subsidy, 87 percent of petroleum subsidy and 76 percent of the social safety net subsidy went to the non-poor instead of the poor.|$|E
25|$|There {{were also}} baked goods, all made of wheat flour and baked in an oven, {{which were not}} burned on the altar.

25|$|Key {{was born}} in Chalfont St Giles, Buckinghamshire, where his father worked in the brickfields. At the age of six, his father died and he was brought up by his mother alone; the family were very poor and not only did his mother have {{to work as a}} charlady, Key himself was needed to work on {{deliveries}} for a local draper. The family were largely dependent on poor relief under the Poor Law: in later life Key often remembered collecting 1s. 6d. and two quartern <b>loaves</b> <b>of</b> bread, being two-fifths of a pound. He claimed to have promised his mother at the age of nine that he would get into Parliament and repeal the Poor Law.|$|E
50|$|Stories of {{the origin}} of bunny chow date {{as far back as the}} migrant Indian workers arrival in South Africa. One account {{suggests}} that migrant workers from India who were brought to South Africa to work the sugar cane plantations of Kwazulu-Natal (Port Natal) required a way of carrying their lunches to the field; a hollowed out <b>loaf</b> <b>of</b> bread was a convenient way to transport their vegetarian curries. Meat based fillings came later. The use <b>of</b> a <b>loaf</b> <b>of</b> bread can also be ascribed to the lack of the traditional roti bread, in the absence <b>of</b> which a <b>loaf</b> <b>of</b> bread would be acceptable as an accompaniment to curry.|$|R

25|$|According to halakha (Jewish {{religious}} law), Shabbat {{is observed}} {{from a few}} minutes before sunset on Friday evening until the appearance of three stars in the sky on Saturday night. Shabbat is ushered in by lighting candles and reciting a blessing. Traditionally, three festive meals are eaten: in the evening, in the early afternoon, and late in the afternoon. The evening meal typically begins with a blessing called kiddush and another blessing recited over two <b>loaves</b> <b>of</b> challah. Shabbat is closed the following evening with a havdalah blessing. Shabbat is a festive day when Jews exercise their freedom from the regular labors of everyday life. It offers an opportunity to contemplate the spiritual aspects of life and to spend time with family.|$|E
25|$|Lishansky joined Nili in December 1915, when Avshalom Feinberg {{was arrested}} for espionage and held in Beersheba. Because he {{was active in the}} south, he was {{recruited}} by Feinberg to pass information to and from Sarah Aaronsohn, who was operating from Atlit. He did this by hiding notes in the <b>loaves</b> <b>of</b> bread passed to the prisoners. In January 1917, after Feinberg was released and sought to secretly travel to Egypt to meet with the British, he was accompanied by Lishansky, who had intimate knowledge of the area. On 20 January they were attacked by two Ottoman soldiers and a gang of Bedouin near Rafah, which left Feinberg dead and Lishansky wounded. Lishansky was left to die but managed to reach a British patrol that took him to a hospital in Port Said, where he met Aaron Aaronsohn on 25 January 1917, and told him about Feinberg's death. Because Lishansky was the only witness to the killing, rumors started circulating that {{he was the one who}} killed Feinberg for personal reasons, or because of a romance with Sarah Aaronsohn. They were disproved only after the Six-Day War, when Feinberg's remains were found and the Bedouin in the region interrogated.|$|E
25|$|Education writer Richard Wright {{considers}} that Hume's position rejects a famous moral puzzle attributed to French philosopher Jean Buridan. The Buridan's ass puzzle describes a donkey that is hungry. This donkey has {{on both sides}} of him separate bales of hay, which are of equal distances from him. The problem concerns which bale the donkey chooses. Buridan was said to believe that the donkey would die, because he has no autonomy. The donkey is incapable of forming a rational decision as there is no motive to choose one bale of hay over the other. However, human beings are different, because a human who is placed in a position where he is forced to choose one loaf of bread over another will make a decision to take one in lieu of the other. For Buridan, humans have the capacity of autonomy, and he recognises the choice that is ultimately made will be based on chance, as both <b>loaves</b> <b>of</b> bread are exactly the same. However, Wright says that Hume completely rejects this notion, arguing that a human will spontaneously act in such a situation because he is faced with impending death if he fails to do so. Such a decision is not {{made on the basis of}} chance, but rather on necessity and spontaneity, given the prior predetermined events leading up to the predicament.|$|E
