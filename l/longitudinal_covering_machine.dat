40|$|Doffing {{operation}} for the <b>covering</b> <b>machine</b> has been already automated by the auto drawing-in apparatus loaded on the autonomous vehicle. The vehicle repeats moving and stop while measuring its position and attitude {{with a pair}} of laser displacement sensors. In this report, control methods for this autonomous vehicle are investigated to approach the initial operating position rapidly, to break away {{at the end of the}} <b>covering</b> <b>machine,</b> and to turn around it. Fuzzy control was applied to the path tracking that the autonomous vehicle approaches the initial operating position of the <b>covering</b> <b>machine.</b> It obtains much rapider response than the method in which the front wheel takes on the reference path. Using this advantage of fuzzy control, it enables the vehicle to turn back over the side of the <b>covering</b> <b>machine</b> with stability. By means of this, the autonomous vehicle can directly use the machine frame as a guide way without any additions extraordinary to the <b>covering</b> <b>machine...</b>|$|R

However the automatic drawing-in system developed {{in order to improve}} drawing-in operation is not able to distinguish whether the core yarn is successfully drawn into the hollow spindle or not. So we developed a detecting system for fine Spandex, applying pressure variation in pipe flow caused by yarn behavior. Results obtained are as follows : (1) Pressure variation can check the presence of Spandex when it runs through, a small air flow pipe.

Drawing Spandex to be a core yarn of covered yarn into the hollow spindles is so complicated that its automation is especially hoped. So we developed an auto drawing-in apparatus that could draw Spandex in both upper and lower hollow spindles simultaneously. Results obtained are as follows : (1) The auto drawing-in apparatus comprises both an injector and an ejector. Spandex was drawn into the lower spindle by the injection flow driven by the injector and was drawn from the upper spindle by the suction flow driven by the ejector. (2) Drawing-in was performed for a model <b>covering</b> <b>machine</b> by the developed auto-doffing apparatus. It could draw-in 20 D Spandex that was widely used and was too thin to be easily drawn-in even by a manual doffing operation. So this confirmed that the developed auto-doffing apparatus had practical utility in drawing -in operation. (3) The rates of success of Spandex drawing-in {{is influenced by the}} supplied air pressure for the injector, the supplied air pressure for the ejector and the feed rate of Spandex. High certainty of Spandex drawing-in could be accomplished by the proper arrangement of those conditions. 目的 ダブルカバリングマシンによるカバード糸製造時における中空スピンドルへの芯糸通しは作業上ネックとなっており, 自動化が期待されている。そこで上下の中空スピンドルに一度に芯糸を通すことのできる自動芯糸通し装置を開発する. 成果 (1) 一対の空気噴き出し口と空気吸い込み口により構成される芯糸通し装置を試作した. 装置は下スピンドル下部より噴き出し流を, 上スピンドル上部より吸い込み流を作用させることによって芯糸を中空スピンドルに引き通す.
