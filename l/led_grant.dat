2500|$|By {{the time}} Jesse {{and his two}} Jewish {{partners}} arrived with a request for permits to operate, they were immediately rebuffed by an angered General Grant for presuming on the Army and his patience. The incident had been indicative {{of the problem with}} cotton speculators in general who often collaborated with Union Officers, much to the frustration of General Grant. Various modern historians believe that Jesse's arrival with two prominent Jewish cotton speculators from Cincinnati is largely what <b>led</b> <b>Grant</b> in 1862 to issue General Order 11 expelling all Jews from his district. Jesse and his partners were instructed to leave the district on the next train going north. The incident proved to be an embarrassment for Grant which once again placed his father and himself on opposing sides of a serious issue. Later, in a letter to Congressman Washburne, Jesse defended his father's action, claiming the Order was [...] "issued by express instructions from Washington".|$|E
2500|$|Grant's {{plan had}} been to lure Pemberton into {{splitting}} his force, allowing the Confederate army to be defeated in detail. [...] News that Pemberton's left wing had retreated to the rail center at Jackson, Mississippi, where it was receiving reinforcements from across the Confederacy, [...] <b>led</b> <b>Grant</b> to change his plan of attack. [...] Whereas initially {{he had planned to}} detach McPherson's two divisions to destroy Jackson, Grant now planned a full-scale assault on the Mississippi capital. This led to the Battle of Jackson on May 14, 1863, which was essentially a rear-guard action for the suddenly timorous Joseph E. Johnston. The threat of Confederate reinforcement having been eliminated, Grant turned and defeated Pemberton at the Battle of Champion Hill on May 16, and the Battle of Big Black River Bridge on May 17. Pemberton, his army all but shattered, retreated into Fortress Vicksburg, where his men rallied to thwart two Federal assaults, but finally accepted the inevitable and surrendered on July 4, 1863.|$|E

5000|$|Babcock's tenure under President Grant {{was filled}} with {{controversy}} concerning involvement with the manipulation of both cabinet departments and appointments. Grant supported Babcock when Babcock was accused of corruption; Grant's shielding of Babcock from political attack stemmed primarily from their shared experiences on the battlefield during the American Civil War. [...] When Babcock was indicted {{as a member of}} the Whiskey Ring in 1875, Grant intended to travel to St. Louis and testify on his behalf. Dissuaded by his cabinet on the grounds that taking part in person at a trial would demean the presidency, Grant still insisted on providing a written deposition on Babcock's behalf—a first for a sitting president—which was admitted at Babcock's 1876 trial and resulted in his acquittal. The news coverage of the Whiskey Ring and other Grant administration scandals caused public opinion to turn against Babcock. Having gone so far as to provide what was almost certainly false testimony in order to save Babcock from disgrace, Grant lost trust in him. This loss of faith, combined with the negative public attention, <b>led</b> <b>Grant</b> to dismiss Babcock from the White House. Even though Grant fired Babcock as his private secretary, he did not desert his wartime comrade; he appointed Babcock Inspector of Lighthouses for the Federal Lighthouse Board's 5th and 6th Districts, a low-profile post that did not attract undue public attention. Babcock continued in this position under Presidents Rutherford B. Hayes, James A. Garfield, and Chester A. Arthur without controversy. During his tenure, Babcock was the chief engineer overseeing plans for the construction of Mosquito Inlet Lighthouse. He died in 1884 when he drowned off Mosquito Inlet in Daytona Beach, Florida.|$|E

5000|$|As the war {{caused the}} price of cotton to {{escalate}} it invited many speculators, moving about {{in the midst of}} a major and prolonged military campaign against Vicksburg, causing many problems for the Union Army. At this time Jesse became involved in cotton speculation and arrived with his two partners, Mack Brothers from Cincinnati, who had encouraged him to use his son's (General Grant) influence to obtain permits to purchase cotton in a war district. Traveling from Ohio they arrived unexpectedly at General Grant's headquarters in northern Mississippi while he was busy with commanding a major campaign. Grant had already received reports from Sherman and others of Jewish merchants who were [...] "highly visible" [...] among the trading which was occurring by both northern and southern interests, often without permits. [...] By the time Jesse and his two Jewish partners arrived with a request for permits to operate, they were immediately rebuffed by an angered General Grant for his presuming on the Army and his patience.
