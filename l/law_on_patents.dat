This is the case for the Paris convention, which allows for claiming priority of up to 1 year from an earlier patent application in a Paris convention country. The Patent Cooperation Treaty also applies on Aruba, and the Bureau of Intellectual property acts as a receiving office for international (PCT) applications. However, as the Kingdom of the Netherlands has [...] "closed its national route", it is -also in Aruba- not possible to designate the Aruban patent {{at the end of the}} international phase. Since 1987, the Convention on the Unification of Certain Points of Substantive <b>Law</b> <b>on</b> <b>Patents</b> for Invention, which harmonised patent law in several European states applies.|$|E
40|$|The European Patent Convention (EPC) {{provides}} for a common application and examination procedure for European patents. Therefore, European patents are granted {{on the basis of}} uniform European law which is applied and interpreted by the EPO, as well as by a great number of national judges and members of other authorities who are bound by national case law. The fact that the EPC and corresponding national patent law is "uniform law" requires that it is construed in an international spirit based on its ratio and with a view to create cross-border legal uniformity. This is not least underscored {{by the fact that the}} extent of protection conferred by a European patent should be determined according to Article 69 EPC and the Protocol on the Interpretation of Article 69 EPC and that a large part of national patent laws of EPC Contracting states have been unified with the Strasbourg Convention on the Unification of Certain Points of Substantive <b>Law</b> <b>on</b> <b>Patents</b> for Invention and the 1975 Community Patent Convention - as agreed in a resolution on the adjustment of national patent law - in order to achieve legal uniformity. However, diverging decisions with regard to the corresponding parts of a European patent remain an issue to date. Furthermore, under current law the patent holder must initiate several parallel infringement actions, based on the same European patent and directed against the same alleged infringer before the national courts in the states where the infringing acts have taken place. This situation gives rise to many difficulties for the parties and has several undesirable effects which weaken the patent system in Europe. The PhD thesis deals with different legal measures which would promote the uniform interpretation of European patent law and which would help to ease the difficulties related to multiple litigation. This includes in particular, - the creation of specialised courts at national level and the influence of cross-border forum shopping in this regard, including the problems and possible solutions related to forum shopping, - the judicial cooperation among judges, including the exchange of judges and scientific support from scholars and practitioners, - the establishment of an international referral body, - Alternative Dispute Resolution (Arbitration, Mediation, and other instruments), - harmonisation of the court proceedings and the substantive patent law, - cross-border injunctions, or - the establishment of a common court of appeal. The author concludes that specialisation at the level of first instance courts in combination with several other of the above mentioned measures could ensure a uniform interpretation of European patent law. Finally, the author outlines past and current attempts for the establishment of a common patent court in Europe with a clear focus on the proposed court architecture and the elaboration of specific conditions regarding the organisation of the court in order to safeguard a uniform interpretation of European patent law and to avoid multiple litigation. The Ph. D. thesis was completed under the supervision of Prof. dr. Jan J. Brinkhof and Prof. dr. F. Willem Grosheide...|$|E
40|$|The Court of Justice of the European Union has {{frequently}} {{been criticized for}} its allegedly pro-integration and almost pro-active judicial policy regarding the construction {{and the application of}} primary and secondary Union law. This paper aims at showing that, at least with respect {{to the development of a}} uniform case law on harmonized national and unified Community industrial property, the Court has had and still has to fulfil its unique task of informing national courts and the industrial property community in general as to the direction, in which European Union law is to evolve in the interest of the Union’s legal unity and of its independent industrial property policy. To this effect, a comparison is made between, on the one hand, the system of decentralized judicial review as it has been established with respect to both harmonized national copyright, trademark and design law, and unitary Community trademarks, designs and plant varieties, with, on the other hand, the recent proposals made for the conclusion of a “European Patent Litigation Agreement (EPLA) ” and for the creation by international agreement of a highly centralized “European and European Union Patent Court (EEUPC) ”. Both concern the settlement of litigation over infringement and validity of patents, the former relating only to national patents resulting from the bundle of patents granted by the European Patent Office at uniform conditions, the latter to both these patents and the unitary European Union patent (formerly the Community patent) as expected to be introduced by a Community regulation. More particularly, the paper critically assesses the relationship between the proposed inter-national EEUPC and the European Court of Justice. The draft agreement as currently under consideration by the Council of the European Union pretends at creating a workable link between the two different courts with a view to ensuring primacy of the Union’s law and uniformity of the application of its secondary <b>law</b> <b>on</b> <b>patents.</b> However, in reality the proposal tends to both severely reduce the role, which the European Court of Justice ought to play in the Union’s legal order, and to restrict the sovereign development of a forward looking, independent patent policy by the Union. This is so because, on the one hand, as a specialised and centralised high court, the EEUPC will by itself and by its very vocation ensure the development of a patent-specific “expert” case law and of its uniformity, and, on the other, because the inclusion of both the European and the European Union patent into one litigation agreement containing a full set of rules on the infringement and on the revocation of patents will exclude any unilaterally defined patent policy. As a result, patent law is vowed to develop in splendid isolation, and without the benefit of the guidance, which the European Court of Justice, it being a supreme court of general jurisdiction, has given and is called upon to give in other areas of the protection of industrial and intellectual property in the Union...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{scholarship}} {{has suggested that}} trade secrecy may be as important, if not more important, than patenting as an intellectual property protection mechanism in the United States economy. While patent protection {{has always been an}} institution in the United States {{as a result of its}} inclusion in the Constitution, trade secret protection has only been statutorily recognized by the federal government in the last half-century. Similarly, while there has been extensive theoretical and empirical research <b>on</b> the incentives <b>patent</b> protection creates for firms to innovate, and the resulting effects on economic growth, there have been comparatively few theoretical studies and only a handful of empirical papers investigating the effects of trade secrecy. This leaves policy makers with little to no understanding of the effects of trade secrecy on the economy or how to influence trade secrecy through policy. This thesis provides insight into the second question by investigating the effect of implementing statutory trade secret <b>law</b> <b>on</b> <b>patent</b> application and trade secrecy litigation rates. Specifically, this thesis performs a difference in difference analysis on the implementation of the Pennsylvania Uniform Trade Secrets Act with respect to the above metrics. While the effect of trade secret litigation is inconclusive, this thesis finds that patent application rates and the rate of growth of patent applications decrease in response to the implementation of statutory trade secret law. This implies a theorized, but never before measured, substitution effect between patents and trade secrets. In addition, this shows that the level of trade secret protection can be influenced by policymakers through statutory law. When combined with an empirical study on the welfare effects of trade secret protection, this thesis will give policymakers a reference point from which to consider the benefits of further statutory trade secret law. by Mackey Craven.

50|$|Parliament's {{decision}} {{to strike down}} the final draft has the effect that national laws will not be harmonised. National legislatures may continue to enact <b>laws</b> allowing <b>patents</b> <b>on</b> computer-implemented inventions, should they wish to do so, and national courts may enforce such laws. The European Patent Office, which is not legally bound by any EU directive but generally adapts its regulations to new EU law, has no reason or incentive to adapt its practice of granting <b>patents</b> <b>on</b> computer-implemented inventions under certain conditions, according to its interpretation of the European Patent Convention and its Implementing Regulations.|$|R

" In Part 2, I will examine influential design-patent decisions from the 1870 s through the 1930 s against this cultural backdrop. My close reading of these decisions will demonstrate that federal judges, particularly in leading cases decided by the Second Circuit, increasingly used design-patent disputes as a vehicle for the performance and endorsement of prevailing gender norms.

40|$|Here, I {{study the}} effect of state {{enactment}} of trade secrets <b>laws</b> <b>on</b> R&D and <b>patenting.</b> Stronger secrecy protection could increase or reduce R&D. By reducing spillovers, stronger protection might reduce or raise the return to R&D, depending on whether spillover and own R&D are complements or substitutes. By strengthening appropriability, stronger protection would raise the return to R&D. Empirically, I found a nuanced relation between enactment of trade secrets laws and R&D among U. S. manufacturers between 1976 and 2006. Enactment was associated with higher R&D among high-tech and larger companies. For the average company in the respective industry, enactment was associated with 11. 5 % more R&D in pharmaceuticals and 11. 6 % more R&D in aircraft equipment. Further, I found that enactment of trade secrets law was associated with reduced patenting {{to the extent that}} managers reported patents to be effective in appropriating innovation.

40|$|The law {{governing}} the Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s appellate jurisdiction {{was brought into}} question in Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado Circulation Systems, Inc. The Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s appellate jurisdiction over Vornado 2 ̆ 7 s appeal rested solely on Vornado 2 ̆ 7 s counterclaim alleging patent infringement by Holmes. Holmes 2 ̆ 7 s complaint sought a declaratory judgment of no trade dress infringement and did not include any patent law claims. While the Federal Circuit found appellate jurisdiction over Vornado 2 ̆ 7 s appeal based on the counterclaim of patent infringement, the Supreme Court disagreed. The Court focused on the language in 35 U. S. C. § 1338 (a), which defines the Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s appellate jurisdiction by the statute 2 ̆ 7 s reference in 35 U. S. C. § 1295 (a) (1). The Court indicated that the 2 ̆ 2 arising under 2 ̆ 2 language in § 1338 (a) invokes the well-pleaded complaint rule. The Court noted that the well pleaded complaint rule provides that whether a case 2 ̆ 2 aris[es] under 2 ̆ 2 federal law, {{or in this case}} patent law, must be determined from the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s complaint. The Court therefore concluded that a counterclaim, such as Vornado 2 ̆ 7 s, did not 2 ̆ 2 aris[e] under 2 ̆ 2 patent law because it was not contained within the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s, in this case Holmes 2 ̆ 7 s, complaint, and thus could not give the Federal Circuit appellate jurisdiction[ [...] . ] The Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Holmes presents significant questions about the scope of the Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s appellate jurisdiction and the removal and exclusive jurisdiction of federal district courts over patent law claims. This uncertainty threatens the uniformity in patent law that the Federal Circuit was charged with creating. This Article addresses these questions and concludes that the potential for non-uniformity resulting from the ruling in Holmes is real. The rationale underlying the Holmes decision will divert patent law counterclaims from the federal judicial system, not just the Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s appellate review. In addition, situations will likely arise where regional circuits revisit issues already decided by the Federal Circuit in light of the circuit 2 ̆ 7 s pre- 1982 case law. A body of state <b>law</b> <b>on</b> <b>patent</b> issues may also be developed. To prevent these situations from occurring, the effect of Holmes on the Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s appellate jurisdiction must be limited and regional circuits and state courts must look to the Federal Circuit for guidance <b>on</b> <b>patent</b> <b>law</b> issues. Just as the Federal Circuit gives proper deference to regional circuit decisions <b>on</b> non-patent <b>law</b> issues, regional circuits and state courts should give deference to the Federal Circuit on issues related to patent law. Additionally, legislative responses could provide an absolute solution to the problem presented by Holmes. Congress can amend § 1295 (a) and § 1338 to return the Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s appellate jurisdiction, and federal district court jurisdiction, to its state before Holmes. This would ensure, even post-Holmes, that patent law claims are litigated at the federal level and reviewed by the Federal Circuit. This Article reaches these conclusions in the following manner. Part I of this Article begins by looking at the creation of the Federal Circuit, including the reasons Congress created a specialized appellate court for patent law. Part I proceeds to examine the development of the case law that defined the Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s appellate jurisdiction over patent law claims, up to the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Holmes. Part II of this Article examines, in-depth, the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Holmes. Part III attempts to further define the specific types of cases that must, under Holmes, be appealed to a regional circuit as opposed to being appealed to the Federal Circuit. The effect of Holmes on federal district court removal and exclusive jurisdiction over patent law claims will also be examined. To provide an empirical prospective, published Federal Circuit cases, since the Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s inception in 1982, will be reviewed to determine which of these cases would, under the Holmes decision, have gone to the regional circuit or stayed in state court. Part III also discusses the 2 ̆ 2 choice of law 2 ̆ 2 rules that regional circuits and state courts may adopt to handle the patent law claims they will review or decide. Part III also examines the non-uniformity and conflicts that will be created if regional circuits and state courts ignore the Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s case law and begin to develop their own, independent precedent <b>on</b> <b>patent</b> issues. Part III takes as an example specific areas of patent law, such as the patentability of business method patents, and looks to how different regional circuits and state courts may treat these patent law issues. Part IV focuses on the non-uniformity that the holding in Holmes creates. In particular, Part IV investigates the harm the result of Holmes will have on doctrinal stability and horizontal equity in patent law. Finally, Part V presents potential solutions to prevent this breach of uniformity in patent law post-Holmes, suggesting that regional circuits and state courts observe Federal Circuit <b>law</b> as controlling <b>on</b> <b>patent</b> <b>law</b> claims and that, in order to truly preserve patent law uniformity, legislation must be passed to restore the Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s appellate jurisdiction, and federal district court exclusive jurisdiction, to where it stood before the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Holmes...|$|R
