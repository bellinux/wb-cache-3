25|$|The P54C was {{followed}} by the P54CQS which operated at 120MHz. It was fabricated in a 0.35µm BiCMOS process and was the first commercial microprocessor to be fabricated in a 0.35µm process. Its transistor count is identical to the P54C and, despite the newer process, it had an identical die area as well. The chip was connected to the package using wire bonding, which only allows connections along the edges of the chip. A smaller chip would have required a redesign of the package, as there is a limit on the length of the wires and the edges of the chip would be further away from the pads on the package. The solution was to keep the chip the same size, retain the existing pad-ring, and only reduce the size of the Pentium's <b>logic</b> <b>circuitry</b> to enable it to achieve higher clock frequencies.|$|E

This places some limitations on mixing for Dolby Stereo and to ensure that sound mixers mixed soundtracks appropriately they would monitor the sound mix via a Dolby Stereo encoder and decoder in tandem. In addition to the <b>logic</b> <b>circuitry</b> the surround channel is also fed via a delay, adjustable up to 100 ms to suit auditoria of differing sizes, to ensure that any leakage of program material intended for left or right speakers into the surround channel is always heard first from the intended speaker.
