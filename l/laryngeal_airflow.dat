In this case, the synthesizer includes mathematical models of the vocal fold oscillation and associated <b>laryngeal</b> <b>airflow,</b> and the consequent acoustic wave propagation along the vocal tract.

50|$|The {{human voice}} {{consists}} of sound {{made by a}} human being using the vocal folds for talking, singing, laughing, crying, screaming, etc. The human voice frequency is specifically a part of human sound production in which the vocal folds (vocal cords) are the primary sound source. (Other sound production mechanisms produced from the same general area of the body involve the production of unvoiced consonants, clicks, whistling and whispering.) Generally speaking, the mechanism for generating the human voice can be subdivided into three parts; the lungs, the vocal folds within the larynx, and the articulators. The lung (the pump) must produce adequate airflow and air pressure to vibrate vocal folds (this air pressure is the fuel of the voice). The vocal folds (vocal cords) are a vibrating valve that chops up the airflow from the lungs into audible pulses that form the laryngeal sound source. The muscles of the larynx adjust the length and tension of the vocal folds to ‘fine-tune’ pitch and tone. The articulators (the parts of the vocal tract above the larynx consisting of tongue, palate, cheek, lips, etc.) articulate and filter the sound emanating from the larynx {{and to some degree}} can interact with the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>airflow</b> to strengthen it or weaken it as a sound source.|$|E
40|$|National audienceIn {{speech and}} singing, {{it is common}} to observe a {{vibration}} of ventricular bands accompanying the vocal-folds vibratory movement. In this paper, we aim to explore this interaction both “in vivo” on a singer using electroglottography and high-speed cinematography, and “in vitro” on a repliqua of self-oscillating vocal-folds and rigid ventricular bands using a simplified aerodynamical model for <b>laryngeal</b> <b>airflow</b> coupled to a two-mass model for vocal-folds vibratory motion. The in vitro results show that, depending on the geometry, the presence of a constriction above the glottis can either alter or favour the glottal vibration, in line with theoretical modelling. In vivo, the alteration of glottal vibration has been observed during each phase of ventricular-bands contact...|$|E
40|$|The airflow {{velocities}} {{and pressures}} are calculated from a three-dimensional {{model of the}} human larynx by using the finite element method. The <b>laryngeal</b> <b>airflow</b> {{is assumed to be}} incompressible, isothermal, steady, and created by fixed pressure drops. The influence of different laryngeal profiles (convergent, parallel, and divergent), glottal area, and dimensions of false vocal folds in the airflow are investigated. The results indicate that vertical and horizontal phase differences in the laryngeal tissue movements are influenced by the nonlinear pressure distribution across the glottal channel, and the glottal entrance shape influences the air pressure distribution inside the glottis. Additionally, the false vocal folds increase the glottal duct pressure drop by creating a new constricted channel in the larynx, and alter the airflow vortexes formed after the true vocal folds.

40|$|The intra-glottal {{vortical}} structures {{developed in}} a static divergent glottis with continuous flow entering the glottis are characterized. <b>Laryngeal</b> <b>airflow</b> calculations are performed using the Large Eddy Simulation approach. It {{has been shown that}} intra-glottal vortices are formed on the divergent wall of the glottis, immediately downstream of the separation point. Even with non-pulsatile flow entering the glottis, the vortices are intermittently shed, producing unsteady flow at the glottal exit. The vortical structures are characterized by significant negative static pressure relative to the ambient pressure. These vortices increase in size and strength as they are convected downstream by the flow due to the entrained air from the supra-glottal region. The negative static pressures associated with the intra-glottal vortical structures suggest that the closing phase during phonation may be accelerated by such vortices. The intra-glottal negative pressures can affect both vocal fold vibration and voice production...|$|E
40|$|Speech {{communication}} {{is fundamental to}} human society yet, {{as a result of}} the relative inaccessibility of the larynx and vocal tract to instrumentation and the complexity of the aerodynamics therein, the mechanism of sound production during speech has not been fully quantified. In this paper we consider vowel production modelling. We describe those aspects of the anatomy and physiology of the speech system that are relevant to the generation of vowel sounds and outline the means by which the larynx is caused to vibrate. We then discuss the equations of fluid mechanics required to model the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>airflow,</b> describing the approximations commonly used to reduce them to a solvable set and assessing the validity of those approximations for speech air-flows during voicing. We next consider the sources of sound that generate the radiated vowel waveforms; we include the traditional glottal-waveform source and a number of other mechanisms that may contribute to the output speech wave. Finally we outline the difficulties in obtaining data from live subjects and some of the methods used to overcome these difficulties...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSinging {{combines}} {{speech and}} music – two activities common and perhaps fundamental to almost all human cultures. Singing involves the coordinated, precise and subtle control of breath, sound {{production in the}} larynx, articulation of the vocal tract – and their interactions. This chapter begins with {{an introduction to the}} fundamental process of phonation: the interaction between <b>laryngeal</b> <b>airflow</b> and the vibration of the vocal folds and nearby tissues that give rise to voiced sounds. Different biomechanical configurations of the larynx, known as laryngeal mechanisms or laryngeal registers, induce various modes of vibration and help to cover the wide range of frequencies associated with singing. The nonlinearity of their vibration produces the harmonic richness of the voice spectrum. The chapter then introduces the acoustical properties of the vocal tract and its resonances, which act as a filter that selectively enhances the output power of some of the frequencies in the voice. It then discusses the interactions between the vocal folds and the acoustic waves in the vocal tract. Finally, it discusses singing and the techniques of resonance tuning: the ways whereby singers adjust their tract resonances to produce a louder, sometimes more stable voice with less effort...|$|E
40|$|A high {{diversity}} of mating calls is found among frogs. The calls of most species, however, are simple, {{in comparison to}} those of mammals and birds. In order {{to determine if the}} mechanics of the larynx could explain the simplicity of treefrog calls, the larynges of euthanized males were activated with airflow. <b>Laryngeal</b> <b>airflow,</b> sound frequency, and sound intensity showed a positive direct relationship with the driving air pressure. While the natural calls of the studied species exhibit minimal frequency modulation, their larynges produced about an octave of frequency modulation in response to varying pulmonary pressure. Natural advertisement calls are produced near the higher extreme of frequency obtained in the laboratory and at a slightly higher intensity (6 [*]dB). Natural calls also exhibit fewer harmonics than artificial ones, because the larynges were activated with the mouth of the animal open. The results revealed that treefrog larynges allow them to produce calls spanning a much greater range of frequencies than observed in nature; therefore, the simplicity of the calls is not due to a limited frequency range of laryngeal output. Low frequencies are produced at low intensities, however, and this could explain why treefrogs concentrate their calling at the high frequencies...|$|E
40|$|We {{know very}} little about how muscles and motor units in one region of the upper airway are {{impacted}} by adjustments in an adjacent airway region. In this case, the focus is on regulation of the expiratory airstream by the larynx and how changes in laryngeal aperture impact muscle motor unit activities downstream in the pharynx. We selected sound production as a framework for study as it requires (i) sustained expiratory airflow, (ii) laryngeal airway regulation for production of whisper and voice, and (iii) pharyngeal airway regulation for production of different vowel sounds. We used these features as the means of manipulating expiratory airflow, pharyngeal, and laryngeal airway opening to compare the effect of each on the activation of genioglossus (GG) muscle motor units in the pharynx. We show that some GG muscle motor units (a) discharge stably on expiration associated with production of vowel sounds, (b) are exquisitely sensitive to subtle alterations in <b>laryngeal</b> <b>airflow,</b> and (c) discharge at higher firing rates in high flow vs. low flow conditions even when producing the same vowel sound. Our results reveal subtle changes in GG motor unit discharge rates that correlate with changes imposed at the larynx, and which may contribute to the regulation of the expiratory airstream...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstract The glottal {{geometry}} is a {{key factor}} in the aerosol delivery efficiency for treatment of lung diseases. However, while glottal vibrations were extensively studied during human phonation, the realistic glottal motion during breathing is poorly understood. Therefore, most current studies assume an idealized steady glottis in the context of respiratory dynamics, and thus neglect the flow unsteadiness related to this motion. This is particularly important to assess the aerosol transport mechanisms in upper airways. This article presents a clinical study conducted on 20 volunteers, to examine the realistic glottal motion during several breathing tasks. Nasofibroscopy was used to investigate the glottal geometrical variations simultaneously with accurate airflow rate measurements. In total, 144 breathing sequences of 30 s were recorded. Regarding the whole database, two cases of glottal time-variations were found: “static” or “dynamic” ones. Typically, the peak value of glottal area during slow breathing narrowed from 217  ±  54  mm 2 (mean ± STD) during inspiration, to 178  ±  35  mm 2 during expiration. Considering flow unsteadiness, it is shown that the harmonic approximation of the airflow rate underevaluates the inertial effects as compared to realistic patterns, especially {{at the onset of the}} breathing cycle. These measurements provide input data to conduct realistic numerical simulations of <b>laryngeal</b> <b>airflow</b> and particle deposition...|$|E
