25|$|The film {{is notable}} for reproductions of 1910-era aircraft, {{including}} a triplane, monoplanes, biplanes and also Horatio Phillips's 20-winged multiplane from 1904. Wheeler insisted on authentic materials but allowed {{the use of}} modern engines and modifications necessary to ensure safety. Of 20 types built in 1964 at £5,000 each, six could fly, flown by six stunt pilots and maintained by 14 mechanics. The race take-off scene where seven aircraft are {{in the air at}} once included a composite addition of one aircraft. Flying conditions were monitored carefully, with aerial scenes filmed before 10am or in early evening when the air was least turbulent, for the replicas, true to the originals, were flimsy, and control, especially in the <b>lateral</b> <b>plane,</b> tended to be marginal. When weather conditions were poor, interiors or other incidental sequences were shot instead. Wheeler eventually served not only as the technical adviser but also as the aerial supervisor throughout the production, and, later wrote a comprehensive background account of the film and the replicas that were constructed to portray period aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|All vessels have keels, {{it is the}} {{backbone}} of the hull. In traditional construction, it is the structure upon which all else depends. Modern monocoque designs include a virtual keel. Even multihulls have keels. On a sailboat, the word [...] "keel" [...] is also used to refer to the area that is added to the hull to improve its <b>lateral</b> <b>plane.</b> The <b>lateral</b> <b>plane</b> is what prevents leeway and allows sailing towards the wind.

2500|$|Expanding {{the beam}} emitted from the laser {{to fill the}} {{aperture}} of the objective {{will result in a}} tighter, diffraction-limited spot. While lateral translation of the trap relative to the sample can be accomplished by translation of the microscope slide, most tweezer setups have additional optics designed to translate the beam to give an extra degree of translational freedom. This can be done by translating the first of the two lenses labelled as [...] "Beam Steering" [...] in the figure. For example, translation of that lens in the <b>lateral</b> <b>plane</b> will result in a laterally deflected beam from what is drawn in the figure. If the distance between the beam steering lenses and the objective is chosen properly, this will correspond to a similar deflection before entering the objective and a resulting lateral translation in the sample plane. The position of the beam waist, that is the focus of the optical trap, can be adjusted by an axial displacement of the initial lens. Such an axial displacement causes the beam to diverge or converge slightly, the end result of which is an axially displaced position of the beam waist in the sample chamber.|$|E
30|$|A {{treatment}} {{failure of the}} initial casting was defined as patients requiring re-manipulation for any cause. These causes included: progression of fracture angulation (in AP or <b>lateral</b> <b>planes)</b> greater than 10 ° during cast wear, cast changes for any reason, or the need for cast wedging.|$|R

50|$|The {{development}} of acetate, bakelite, and vinyl, {{and the production}} of radio broadcast transcriptions helped to solve this.Once these considerably more quiet compounds were developed, it was discovered that the rubber-idler-wheel driven turntables of the period {{had a great deal of}} low-frequency rumble - but only in the <b>lateral</b> <b>plane.</b> So, even though with all other factors being equal, the <b>lateral</b> <b>plane</b> of recording on disc had the higher fidelity, it was decided to record vertically to produce higher-fidelity recordings on these new `silent-surface' materials, for two reasons, the increase in fidelity and the incompatibility with home phonographs which, with their lateral-only playback systems would only produce silence from a vertically modulated disc.|$|E

40|$|Introduction {{and aims}} A single hip screw is the {{recommended}} method of fixation for slipped upper femoral epiphysis (SUFE).

Make a polygonous chest, as before, but without dividing the inner cavity into any apartments or cells; see the second figure for an example. Line the <b>lateral</b> <b>planes</b> CBHI, BHLA, ALMF, etc., with plane mirrors, and at the apertures, scrape off the tin and quicksilver of the mirrors, so that the eye can see through.

50|$|In {{the early}} days of home {{consoles}} with 3-channel amplifiers, Decca and other labels responded by releasing still other versions with the untouched monaural program alone in the <b>lateral</b> <b>plane</b> and the processing alone in the vertical plane.

5000|$|Lateral (roll) {{control in}} early {{aircraft}} was problematic at best. An overly flexible, involuntarily twisting wing can cause involuntary rolling, but even worse, it can convert attempts at correction, either from wing warping or ailerons, into a counteracting [...] "servo tab" [...] effect. Once this was fully understood, wing structures were made progressively more rigid, precluding wing warping altogether - and aircraft became far more controllable in the <b>lateral</b> <b>plane.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The design {{attacked}} the [...] "high-ground" [...] by eschewing the spring isolation, {{which was then}} regarded as a major strength. Instead, it addressed the issues of Groove drag and lateral rigidity, the ultimate objective of which was to stabilise the relationship between cartridge stylus and the spinning record groove. Springs were not considered sufficiently rigid in the <b>lateral</b> <b>plane,</b> and permitted too much rotation of the suspended parts relative to the motor.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} foot shape design to enhance {{stability}} of passive dynamic walk, by constraining fall down phenomenon in both saggital and <b>lateral</b> <b>planes.</b> From geometrical analysis, {{we found that}} stability under {{a wide range of}} slope inclinations will be achieved by limiting swing legs spatially in a certain angle. We also found that the limiting leg's angles, we call constraint mechanisms, are achieved by a certain type of a 3 D sole shape, which provides stability in a compact size. We show the turning motion for a passive dynamic biped walker with constrained mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Triple {{arthrodesis}} with lateral column lengthening {{through the}} calcaneocuboid joint {{was performed on}} 22 feet in 14 patients. The primary indication for sur-gery was severe symptomatic planovalgus deformity unresponsive to conservative measures. All patients achieved solid fusion within 12 weeks. No patient had a decline in ambulatory status. Excellent correction of de-formity was achieved and maintained with an average correction of the talus first metatarsal angle of 25 " in both the AP and <b>lateral</b> <b>planes.</b> Triple arthrodesis with lateral column lengthening provides for reliable arthro-desis and allows correction of severe planovalgus de-formity while maintaining foot length...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Walking motion {{generation}} and validation {{have been a}} significant issue for biped humanoid robot. To generate more natural walking motions, and confirm the validity rapidly, this paper presents work on walking motion planning and validity verifying. Based on spline interpolation method, the walking motions in both sagittal and <b>lateral</b> <b>planes</b> are generated. Dynamic model is constructed with the toolbox of SimMechanics for Matlab, and the interactive forces between robot’s sole and ground are constrained in order to depict the state of balance. Dynamic model {{is driven by the}} walking motions which have been generated. The simulation and analysis demonstrate the validity of the motion which has been designed...|$|R
50|$|Sharklet's {{topography}} creates {{mechanical stress}} on settling bacterium, a {{phenomenon known as}} mechanotransduction. Nanoforce gradients caused by surface variations induces stress gradients within the <b>lateral</b> <b>plane</b> of the surface membrane of a settling microorganism during initial contact. This stress gradient disrupts normal cell functions, forcing the microorganism to provide energy to adjust its contact area on each topographical feature to equalize the stresses. This expenditure of energy is thermodynamically unfavorable to the settler, inducing it {{to search for a}} different surface to attach to. Sharklet is made, however, with the same material as other plastics.|$|E
50|$|The male dog mounts {{the female}} {{and is able}} to achieve intromission with a non-erect penis, which {{contains}} a bone called the os penis. The dog's penis enlarges inside the vagina, thereby preventing its withdrawal; this is sometimes known as the “tie” or “copulatory lock”. The male dog rapidly thrust into the female for 1-2 minutes then dismounts with the erect penis still inside the vagina, and turns to stand rear-end to rear-end with the bitch for up to 30 to 40 minutes; the penis is twisted 180 degrees in a <b>lateral</b> <b>plane.</b> During this time, prostatic fluid is ejaculated.|$|E
50|$|The {{different}} methods of bending the neck require completely different anatomies of the cervical vertebrae. All extant turtles studied {{so far have}} eight vertebrae in the neck. In the Pleurodira, these vertebrae are narrow in cross-section and spool-shaped with biconvex centra on {{one or more of}} the cervicals. These centra act as a double joint, allowing a large degree of sideways movement and providing a means of folding the neck onto itself in the <b>lateral</b> <b>plane.</b> Conversely, in the Cryptodira, the neck bones are wide and flat. The biconvex centra in some of the cryptodiran cervicals allow the neck to fold onto itself in the vertical plane.|$|E
30|$|The KOH™ cup {{fits over}} the patient’s cervix {{and is used}} to stretch the upmost regions of the vagina and to {{distinguish}} the fornices from the surrounding tissue. The KOH™ Colpotomizer system gives excellent uterine manipulation in the anterior, posterior and the <b>lateral</b> <b>planes</b> [4]. The three parts of the KOH™ Colpotomizer system are assembled by the surgeon and fitted into the patient. At {{the conclusion of the}} case, the handle is withdrawn and the KOH™ cup and RUMI® uterine tip manipulator will come out attached to it. Unfortunately, it is possible for the three parts to detach. In this case, the handle and uterine tip were removed but the cup remained around the cervix.|$|R
30|$|The RUMI {{manipulator}} {{with the}} KOH colpotomizer is a versatile uterine manipulator. Not {{only does it}} have extremely good uterine manipulation in the anterior, posterior, and the <b>lateral</b> <b>planes,</b> it also helps with the very easy delineation of the vaginal fornices. The KOH-cup distances the ureter form the uterine vessels and facilitates its easy coagulation. This device helps to complete laparoscopic dissection of the cervix and vagina much more easily, resulting in greater efficacy and less blood loss while eliminating the difficulties pertaining to vaginal access. This enhanced uterine mobility also speeds utero-vesical peritoneal dissection and inferior displacement of the bladder. Furthermore, the RUMI manipulator allows for significant lateral uterine displacement, improving visualization and ease of dissection of the uterine vasculature and broad ligament.|$|R
40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: Endoscopy {{represents}} both {{an alternative}} and useful complement {{to the standard}} microsurgical approach to the anterior craniovertebral junction (CVJ). Nevertheless, few studies provide an experimental comparison between transnasal and transoral endoscopic control on CVJ. We compared the surgical exposition angle and the working channel volume of both the transnasal and transoral approaches in the cadaver. METHODS: Eleven fresh non-perfused cadavers were studied. Transnasal and transoral linear and angled exposure of the CVJ were evaluated by means of X-ray and CT scan both in sagittal and <b>lateral</b> <b>planes.</b> RESULTS: The transoral endoscopic surgical exposition was wider compared with the transnasal in anterior and lateral projections:(1) in the sagittal plane, both in vertical exposition (transnasal inferior to transoral from 5. 89...|$|R
50|$|As {{with other}} mortars {{of this type}} it is {{intended}} for rapid use over short ranges as a fire support weapon. It has a lanyard operated trigger mechanism in the breech which allows it to be carried loaded with a bomb, unlike other mortars that have fixed firing pins.The lack of a bipod means {{it is not as}} accurate as a conventional mortar and is unsuitable for sustained fire use. The sighting system incorporated in the handle consists of a pair of curved spirit levels one to indicate that it upright in the <b>lateral</b> <b>plane</b> and the other indicates the range with a charge table.

50|$|Mr M Bertoux, a French army officer, {{secured a}} prize {{offered by a}} French {{newspaper}} in 1893 for the best method of carrying a passenger on a bicycle. The sidecar wheel was mounted on the same <b>lateral</b> <b>plane</b> as the bicycle's rear and {{was supported by a}} triangulation of tubes from the bicycle. A sprung seat with back rest was mounted above the cross-member and a footboard hung below.A sidecar appeared in a cartoon by George Moore in the January 7, 1903, issue of the British newspaper Motor Cycling. Three weeks later, a provisional patent was granted to Mr. W. J. Graham of Graham Brothers, Enfield, Middlesex. He partnered with Jonathan A. Kahn to begin production.|$|E
50|$|Bolger championed leeboards as low-tech and practical, to {{the chagrin}} of many yachties. The {{conventional}} wisdom is that they are ugly. Even many of his centerboard designs had boards that were off-center or all the way to {{one side or the other}} (for example, the Birdwatcher and the AS29). He concluded that a single leeboard is sufficient in many cases on small boats, and that rigs could be stepped off the centerline without much effect on performance. Bolger advocated leeboards as being a simple means of providing <b>lateral</b> <b>plane</b> to all types of sailing vessel, eliminating many of the disadvantages of centerboards, daggerboards and keels, following broadly in the concepts of L. Francis Herreshoff, various years his senior and, as stated by Bolger, one of the most influential yacht designers from his perspective.|$|E

30|$|This was a {{retrospective}} nonrandomized study encompassing 21 femoral fractures and 27 tibial fractures in 45 patients. They were classified {{according to the}} AO classification. Clinical and radiological checks were done at one, three, and six months and at one year from the surgery in order to check for signs of clinical and radiological healing. A good alignment {{was considered to be}} the presence of a deformity of less than 5 ° in the sagittal and <b>lateral</b> <b>planes</b> and the absence of rotatory clinically evident problems. This protocol was adhered to up to six months after surgery by all of the patients, while only 62.2 % performed the last control. The mean follow-up was 15  months. A second group of 48 consecutive fractures (24 femural and 24 tibial) treated with locked nail was created to compare surgical times.|$|R
40|$|AbstractConvection in a porous medium {{may produce}} strong nonuniqueness of patterns. We study this {{phenomena}} {{for the case}} of a multicomponent fluid and develop a mimetic finite-difference scheme for the three-dimensional problem. Discretization of the Darcy equations in the primitive variables is based on staggered grids with five types of nodes and on a special approximation of nonlinear terms. This scheme is applied to the computer study of flows in a porous parallelepiped filled by a two-component fluid and with two adiabatic <b>lateral</b> <b>planes.</b> We found that the continuous family of steady stable states exists in {{the case of a}} rather thin enclosure. When the depth is increased, only isolated convective regimes may be stable.

5000|$|Bolger is {{particularly}} {{known for his}} Square Boats (derogatorily known as [...] "Bolger Boxes"). Bolger reasoned that a simple rockered bottom and vertical sides gives the most volume, and form stability, on a given beam. After experimenting and studying traditional sharpies and the writings of small-boat historian Howard I. Chapelle and others, he developed {{the theory that the}} optimum chine line for a sailing sharpie should represent a regular curve without breaks, changes in radius or straight sections. He further reasoned that the curve of side and bottom should match as much as possible to reduce turbulence. He further reasoned that the sharpie was an ideal shape for a trailer sailer with either leeboards or bilgeboards to provide <b>lateral</b> <b>plane.</b> [...] Bolger felt that the traditional sharpie shape Chapelle had documented based on traditional New England sharpies (with a slightly different chine profile) was inefficient and prone to causing steering difficulties.|$|E
5000|$|Like steel roller {{coasters}}, wooden {{roller coasters}} usually {{use the same}} three-wheel design, pioneered by John Miller. Each set of wheels includes a running wheel (on top of the track), a side friction (or [...] "guide") wheel (to guide motion in the <b>lateral</b> <b>plane</b> and reduce excessive side-to-side movement known as [...] "hunting") and an upstop wheel (beneath the track to prevent cars from flying off the track). Some wooden coasters, such as Leap-The-Dips, do not have upstop wheels and are known as side friction roller coasters. As a result, the turns and drops are more gentle than on modern wooden roller coasters. Scenic Railway roller coasters also lack upstop wheels but rely on a brake operator to control the speed so that upstop wheels are not necessary. A handful of wooden coasters use flanged wheels, similar to a rail car, {{eliminating the need for}} side friction wheels.|$|E

40|$|Heavy {{vehicles}} exhibit limited directional {{performance and}} stability limits {{due to their}} large dimensions and weights. The liquid tankers are among the freight vehicles with relatively lower stability limits due to the special condition of their cargo that tends to shift in the longitudinal and <b>lateral</b> <b>planes</b> under braking/acceleration and turning maneuvers, when partly-filled. The objective of the present work is to derive an optimal geometry of the cargo tank to enhance the direction performance of the partly-filled vehicle combination during braking/acceleration and turning maneuvers. An optimal longitudinal section of the tank is identified to reduce the fore-aft load shift encountered during braking maneuvers. The identified geometry is coupled with an optimal lateral section, reported in the literature, to synthesize the tank that would yield reduced load shifts in the lateral as well as longitudinal plane...|$|R
50|$|The point spread {{function}} of the pinhole is an ellipsoid, several times {{as long as it}} is wide. This limits the axial resolution of the microscope. One technique of overcoming this is 4 microscopy where incident and or emitted light are allowed to interfere from both above and below the sample to reduce the volume of the ellipsoid. An alternative technique is confocal theta microscopy. In this technique the cone of illuminating light and detected light are at an angle to each other (best results when they are perpendicular). The intersection of the two point spread functions gives a much smaller effective sample volume. From this evolved the single plane illumination microscope. Additionally deconvolution may be employed using an experimentally derived point spread function to remove the out of focus light, improving contrast in both the axial and <b>lateral</b> <b>planes.</b>|$|R
