She was released from a New York City hospital on February 13 {{and returned to the}} bench when the Supreme Court went back into session on February 23, 2009. On September 24, 2009, Ginsburg was hospitalized in Washington DC for <b>lightheadedness</b> following an outpatient treatment for iron deficiency and was released the following day.|$|E
5|$|Systemic {{symptoms}} {{resulting from}} anaphylaxis can be dramatic. These may appear within 5 minutes post bite, {{or can be}} delayed for many hours. Such symptoms include nausea, retching and vomiting, abdominal colic and diarrhoea, incontinence of urine and faeces, sweating, fever, vasoconstriction, tachycardia, <b>lightheadedness,</b> loss of consciousness, blindness, shock, angioedema of the face, lips, gums, tongue, throat and epiglottis, urticaria and bronchospasm. If left untreated, these symptoms may persist or fluctuate for up to 48 hours. In severe cases, cardiovascular failure may occur.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms are {{dependent}} {{on the type of}} TBI (diffuse or focal) and {{the part of the brain}} that is affected. Unconsciousness tends to last longer for people with injuries on the left side of the brain than for those with injuries on the right. Symptoms are also dependent on the injury's severity. With mild TBI, the patient may remain conscious or may lose consciousness for a few seconds or minutes. Other symptoms of mild TBI include headache, vomiting, nausea, lack of motor coordination, dizziness, difficulty balancing, <b>lightheadedness,</b> blurred vision or tired eyes, ringing in the ears, bad taste in the mouth, fatigue or lethargy, and changes in sleep patterns. Cognitive and emotional symptoms include behavioral or mood changes, confusion, and trouble with memory, concentration, attention, or thinking. Mild TBI symptoms may also be present in moderate and severe injuries.|$|E

25|$|Nociception {{can also}} cause {{generalized}} autonomic responses before or without reaching consciousness to cause pallor, diaphoresis, tachycardia, hypertension, <b>lightheadedness,</b> nausea and fainting.|$|E
25|$|When {{arterial}} pressure and blood flow decrease beyond a certain point, the perfusion {{of the brain}} becomes critically decreased (i.e., the blood supply is not sufficient), causing <b>lightheadedness,</b> dizziness, weakness or fainting.|$|E
25|$|Tests for vertigo often {{attempt to}} elicit {{nystagmus}} and to differentiate vertigo from other causes of dizziness such as presyncope, hyperventilation syndrome, disequilibrium, or psychiatric causes of <b>lightheadedness.</b> Tests of vestibular system (balance) function include: electronystagmography (ENG), Dix-Hallpike maneuver, rotation tests, head-thrust test, caloric reflex test, and computerized dynamic posturography (CDP).|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include <b>lightheadedness,</b> headache, feeling tired, leg swelling, cough, and {{shortness}} of breath. Serious side effects may include low {{blood pressure and}} heart failure. There is tentative evidence that its use in pregnancy is safe; however, it is not recommended during breastfeeding. It is a calcium channel blocker of the dihydropyridine type.|$|E
25|$|Atrial flutter {{is usually}} well tolerated {{initially}} (a high heart rate is {{for most people}} just a normal response to exercise), however, people with other underlying heart disease or poor exercise tolerance may rapidly develop symptoms, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, <b>lightheadedness</b> or dizziness, nausea and, in some patients, nervousness and feelings of impending doom.|$|E
25|$|In adults {{side effects}} with greater than 10% {{incidence}} include weight gain, headache, agitation or anxiety, insomnia, and gastro-intestinal effects like nausea and constipation, and <b>lightheadedness.</b> Side effects in children are similar, and include sleepiness, increased appetite, and stuffy nose. A {{strong desire to}} gamble, binge eat, shop, and have sex may also occur. Cases of pathological gambling have been reported.|$|E
25|$|Wolff–Parkinson–White {{syndrome}} (WPW) is {{a disorder}} {{due to a}} specific type of problem with the electrical system of the heart which has resulted in symptoms. About 40% of people with the electrical problem never develop symptoms. Symptoms can include an abnormally fast heartbeat, palpitations, shortness of breath, <b>lightheadedness,</b> or syncope. Rarely cardiac arrest may occur. The most common type of irregular heartbeat that occurs is known as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include vomiting, constipation, itchiness, <b>lightheadedness,</b> and drowsiness. Serious side effects may include {{breathing}} difficulties and addiction. It is unclear if {{its use in}} pregnancy is safe. Care should be used during breastfeeding as it may result in opiate toxicity in the baby. Its use as of 2016 is not recommended in children. Codeine works following being broken down by the liver into morphine. How quickly this occurs depends on a person's genetics.|$|E
25|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF or A-fib) is {{an abnormal}} heart rhythm characterized by rapid and irregular beating of the atria. Often it starts as brief periods of abnormal beating which become longer and possibly constant over time. Often episodes have no symptoms. Occasionally {{there may be}} heart palpitations, fainting, <b>lightheadedness,</b> shortness of breath, or chest pain. The disease is {{associated with an increased}} risk of heart failure, dementia, and stroke. It is a type of supraventricular tachycardia.|$|E
25|$|Motion {{sickness}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} prominent symptoms of vertigo and develops most often in persons with inner ear problems. The feeling of dizziness and <b>lightheadedness</b> is often accompanied by nystagmus (an involuntary movement of the eye characterized by a smooth pursuit eye movement followed by a rapid saccade in the opposite direction of the smooth pursuit eye movement). During a single episode of vertigo, this action will occur repeatedly. Symptoms can fade while sitting still with the eyes closed.|$|E
25|$|The United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) {{guide for}} the {{management}} of CFS states that while there is no cure, a number of methods might improve symptoms. Treatment strategies for sleep problems, pain, (depression, stress, and anxiety) dizziness and <b>lightheadedness</b> (Orthostatic Intolerance), and memory and concentration problems are enumerated. Other useful topics mentioned that patients and doctors might discuss include; carefully monitoring and managing activity to avoid worsening of symptoms, counseling to cope with the impact the illness may have on quality of life, proper nutrition and nutritional supplements that may support better health, complementary therapies that might help increase energy or decrease pain.|$|E
25|$|Cyclobenzaprine {{produces}} {{confusion and}} lethargy, {{as well as}} anticholinergic side effects. When taken in excess or {{in combination with other}} substances, it may also be toxic. While the body adjusts to this medication, it is possible for patients to experience dry mouth, fatigue, <b>lightheadedness,</b> constipation or blurred vision. Some serious but unlikely side effects may be experienced, including mental or mood changes, possible confusion and hallucinations, and difficulty urinating. In a very few cases, very serious but rare side effects may be experienced: irregular heartbeat, yellowing of eyes or skin, fainting, abdominal pain including stomachache, nausea or vomiting, lack of appetite, seizures, dark urine, or loss of coordination.|$|E
25|$|The muscle {{weakness}} of botulism characteristically {{starts in the}} muscles supplied by the cranial nerves—a group of twelve nerves that control eye movements, the facial muscles and the muscles controlling chewing and swallowing. Double vision, drooping of both eyelids, loss of facial expression and swallowing problems may therefore occur. In addition to affecting the voluntary muscles, it can also cause disruptions in the autonomic nervous system. This is experienced as a dry mouth and throat (due to decreased production of saliva), postural hypotension (decreased blood pressure on standing, with resultant <b>lightheadedness</b> and risk of blackouts), and eventually constipation (due to decreased forward movement of intestinal contents). Some of the toxins (B and E) also precipitate nausea, vomiting, and difficulty with talking. The weakness then spreads to the arms (starting in the shoulders and proceeding to the forearms) and legs (again from the thighs down to the feet).|$|E
25|$|Progesterone is well-tolerated {{and many}} {{clinical}} {{studies have reported}} no side effects. Side effects of progesterone may include abdominal cramps, back pain, breast tenderness, constipation, nausea, dizziness, edema, vaginal bleeding, hypotension, fatigue, dysphoria, depression, and irritability. Side effects including drowsiness, sedation, sleepiness, fatigue, sluggishness, reduced , dizziness, <b>lightheadedness,</b> decreased mental acuity, confusion, and cognitive, memory, and/or motor impairment may occur with oral ingestion and/or at high doses of progesterone, and are due to progesterone's neurosteroid metabolites (namely allopregnanolone). The same may be true for side effects of progesterone including dysphoria, depression, anxiety, irritability, and decreased friendliness, and both the adverse cognitive/sedative and emotional side effects of progesterone may be reduced or avoided by parenteral routes of administration such as vaginal or intramuscular injection. Also, some medical professionals may advise patients to take progesterone before bed to avoid these side effects and/or to help with sleep.|$|E
25|$|The British National Formulary {{recommends}} a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing anti-psychotic treatment to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Due to compensatory changes at dopamine, serotonin, adrenergic and histamine receptor {{sites in the}} central nervous system, withdrawal symptoms can occur during abrupt or over-rapid reduction in dosage. However, despite increasing demand for safe and effective antipsychotic withdrawal protocols or dose-reduction schedules, no specific guidelines with proven safety and efficacy are currently available. Support {{groups such as the}} Icarus Project, and other online forums provide resources and social support for those attempting to discontinue antipsychotics and other psychiatric medications. Withdrawal symptoms reported to occur after discontinuation of antipsychotics include nausea, vomiting, <b>lightheadedness,</b> diaphoresis, dyskinesia, orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, nervousness, dizziness, headache, excessive non-stop crying, and anxiety. Some have argued additional somatic and psychiatric symptoms associated with dopaminergic hypersensitivity, including dyskinesia and acute psychosis, are common features of withdrawal in individuals treated with neuroleptics. Thus, some suggest the withdrawal process itself may be schizo-mimetic, producing schizophrenia-like symptoms even in previously healthy patients.|$|E

500|$|Chronic {{exposure}} to relatively {{low levels of}} carbon monoxide may cause persistent headaches, <b>lightheadedness,</b> depression, confusion, memory loss, nausea and vomiting. It is unknown whether low-level chronic exposure may cause permanent neurological damage. Typically, upon removal from {{exposure to}} carbon monoxide, symptoms usually resolve themselves, unless {{there has been an}} episode of severe acute poisoning. However, one case noted permanent memory loss and learning problems after a 3-year exposure to relatively low levels of carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace. Chronic exposure may worsen cardiovascular symptoms in some people. Chronic carbon monoxide exposure might increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis. [...] Long-term exposures to carbon monoxide present the greatest risk to persons with coronary heart disease and in females who are pregnant.|$|E

2500|$|Pre-syncope is {{a feeling}} of <b>lightheadedness</b> or simply feeling faint. [...] Syncope, by contrast, is {{actually}} fainting. A circulatory system deficiency, such as low blood pressure, can contribute to a feeling of dizziness when one suddenly stands up.|$|E
2500|$|Arrhythmias are {{abnormalities}} {{of the heart}} rate and rhythm (sometimes felt as palpitations). They {{can be divided into}} two broad categories: fast and slow heart rates.

2500|$|Central nervous system: fatigue, dizziness, drowsiness, <b>lightheadedness,</b> confusion, nightmares, agitation, {{increased}} anxiety, difficulty sleeping, seizures (infrequently), temporary confusion (delirium), rarely induction of hypomania and schizophrenia (stop medication immediately), extrapyramidal {{side effects}} (rarely), abuse {{in patients with}} polytoxicomania (rarely), ringing in the ears (tinnitus) ...|$|E
2500|$|Classic {{symptoms}} of Veratrum nigrum toxicity include blurred vision, confusion, headache, <b>lightheadedness,</b> nausea, stomach pain, excessive sweating, and vomiting. In severe cases, heart arrhythmia, muscle cramps, extreme muscle twitching, paresthesia (the feeling of [...] "pins and needles" [...] {{all over the}} body), seizures, weakness, and unconsciousness occur. Death may follow.|$|E
2500|$|Side {{effects are}} similar to those for other β-lactam antibiotics, [...] {{including}} nausea, vomiting, rashes, and antibiotic-associated colitis. Loose bowel movements (diarrhea) may also occur. Rarer side effects include mental changes, <b>lightheadedness,</b> insomnia, confusion, anxiety, sensitivity to lights and sounds, and unclear thinking. Immediate medical care is required upon the first signs of these side effects.|$|E
2500|$|Author John Curra wrote, [...] "The carotid arteries (on {{either side}} of the neck) carry {{oxygen-rich}} blood from the heart to the brain. When these are compressed, as in strangulation or hanging, the sudden loss of oxygen to the brain and the accumulation of carbon dioxide can increase feelings of giddiness, <b>lightheadedness,</b> and pleasure, all of which will heighten masturbatory sensations." ...|$|E
2500|$|Matheny moved Carpenter to {{the number}} two spot in the batting order in late April. [...] He {{continued}} a strong hitting effort. [...] His second game-winner of the season was a sacrifice fly against Pittsburgh on May 2, giving the Cardinals a walk-off 2–1 win in the 11th inning. [...] He left early the next day due to <b>lightheadedness.</b> [...] On May 6 against the Chicago Cubs, his three-run home run tied the score as St. Louis triumphed, 7–4. [...] It was a four-RBI game, giving him 20 in his team's first 26 games.|$|E
2500|$|Aortic {{dissection}} {{occurs when}} {{an injury to}} the innermost layer of the aorta allows blood to flow between the layers of the aortic wall, forcing the layers apart. In most cases this {{is associated with a}} sudden onset of severe chest or back pain, often described as [...] "tearing" [...] in character. Also, vomiting, sweating, and <b>lightheadedness</b> may occur. Other symptoms may result from decreased blood supply to other organs such as stroke or mesenteric ischemia. Aortic dissection can quickly lead to death from not enough blood flow to the heart or rupture of the aorta.|$|E
2500|$|The use of {{theophylline}} {{is complicated}} by its interaction with various drugs and {{by the fact that}} it has a narrow therapeutic window. Its use must be monitored by direct measurement of serum theophylline levels to avoid toxicity. [...] It can also cause nausea, diarrhea, increase in heart rate, abnormal heart rhythms, and CNS excitation (headaches, insomnia, irritability, dizziness and <b>lightheadedness).</b> Seizures can also occur in severe cases of toxicity, and are considered to be a neurological emergency. Its toxicity is increased by erythromycin, cimetidine, and fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin. It can reach toxic levels when taken with fatty meals, an effect called dose dumping. [...] Theophylline toxicity can be treated with beta blockers. [...] In addition to seizures, tachyarrhythmias are a major concern.|$|E
2500|$|By {{definition}} {{chronic sinusitis}} lasts longer {{than three months}} and {{can be caused by}} many different diseases that share chronic inflammation of the sinuses as a common symptom. Symptoms of chronic sinusitis may include any combination of the following: nasal congestion, facial pain, headache, night-time coughing, an increase in previously minor or controlled asthma symptoms, general malaise, thick green or yellow discharge, feeling of facial 'fullness' or 'tightness' that may worsen when bending over, dizziness, aching teeth, and/or bad breath. Each of these symptoms has multiple other possible causes, which should be considered and investigated as well. [...] Often chronic sinusitis can lead to anosmia, the inability to smell objects. In a small number of cases, acute or chronic maxillary sinusitis is associated with a dental infection. Vertigo, <b>lightheadedness,</b> and blurred vision are not typical in chronic sinusitis and other causes should be investigated.|$|E
2500|$|Abnormalities in {{conduction}} and repolarization of {{the heart}} that can result from anorexia nervosa include QT prolongation, increased QT dispersion, conduction delays, [...] and junctional escape rhythms. Electrolyte abnormalities, particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, can cause anomalies in the electrical activity {{of the heart}}, and result in life-threatening arrhythmias. Hypokalemia most commonly results in anorexic patients when restricting is accompanied by purging (induced vomiting or laxative use). Hypotension (low blood pressure) is common, and symptoms include fatigue and weakness. Orthostatic hypotension, a marked decrease in blood pressure when standing from a supine position, may also occur. Symptoms include <b>lightheadedness</b> upon standing, weakness, and cognitive impairment, and may result in fainting or near-fainting. Orthostasis in anorexia nervosa indicates worsening cardiac function and may indicate a need for hospitalization. [...] Hypotension and orthostasis generally resolve upon recovery to a normal weight. The weight loss in anorexia nervosa also causes atrophy of cardiac muscle. This leads to decreased ability to pump blood, {{a reduction in the}} ability to sustain exercise, a diminished ability to increase blood pressure in response to exercise, and a subjective feeling of fatigue. Some individuals may also have a decrease in cardiac contractility. Cardiac complications can be life-threatening, but the heart muscle generally improves with weight gain, and the heart normalizes in size normalizes over weeks to months, with recovery. Atrophy of the heart muscle is a marker of the severity of the disease, and while it is reversible with treatment and refeeding, it is possible that it may cause permanent, microscopic changes to the heart muscle that increase the risk of sudden cardiac death. Individuals with anorexia nervosa may experience chest pain or palpitations; these can be a result of mitral valve prolapse. Mitral valve prolapse occurs because the size of the heart muscle decreases while the tissue of the mitral valve remains the same size. Studies have shown rates of mitral valve prolapse of around 20 percent in those with anorexia nervosa, while the rate in the general population is estimated at 2–4 percent. It has been suggested that there is an association between mitral valve prolapse and sudden cardiac death, but it has not been proven to be causative, either in patients with anorexia nervosa or in the general population.|$|E
