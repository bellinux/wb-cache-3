40|$|Adenoid cystic {{carcinoma}} rarely occurs {{within the}} subglottic larynx. In this study, {{a case of}} subglottic adenoid cystic carcinoma was reported. A 54 year-old Chinese woman developed a sudden onset of chest distress and cough worsening after physical exertion, and was diagnosed with, and treated as, bronchial asthma. Regular anti-asthmatic therapy did not improve the symptoms. Until a sudden dyspnea, a cervicothoracic computerized tomography (CT) revealed that her upper airway was obstructed by a laryngeal tumor. The patient {{was diagnosed with a}} subglottic adenoid cystic carcinoma and treated with complete surgical excision and adjuvant radiation therapy. Follow-up endoscopy and <b>laryngeal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> (MRI) at six months showed no recurrence of the tumor.

40|$|Background: Malignant tumours {{of minor}} salivary glands are uncommon, {{representing}} only 2 - 4 % of all {{head and neck}} cancers. In the larynx, minor salivary gland tumours rarely occur and constitute less than 1 % of laryngeal neoplasm. Most of the minor salivary gland tumours arise in the subglottis; however, they can also occur in the supraglottis, in the false vocal cords, aryepiglottic folds and caudal portion of the epiglottis. The {{most common type of}} malignant minor salivary gland tumour is adenoid cystic carcinoma. Methods: We present a unusual case of adenoid cystic carcinoma of glottic-subglottic region in a 61 -year-old woman. Follow-up endoscopy and <b>laryngeal</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> (MRI) at three years after treatment showed no recurrence of the tumour. Results: The diagnosis of glottic-subglottic adenoid cystic carcinoma should be considered in patients who are characterized by dyspnea, cough and stridor, but do not respond to pharmacologic approach. Conclusions: Adenoid cystic carcinoma is usually a very slow growing cancer, invested by an apparently normal laryngeal mucosa, so that it can show no clear symptoms for a long time. For these reasons the increasing number of diagnostic mistakes or late diagnosis that may be fatal in some cases...|$|E
40|$|Atypical {{carcinoid tumor}} {{of the larynx}} is a {{particularly}} rare occurrence. Here, we report a patient with a laryngeal neuroendocrine tumor (NET) who was treated with transoral robotic surgery-supraglottic laryngectomy (TORS-SL). A 73 -year-old male patient, a known smoker, presented with throat pain and hoarseness for 1 month. Endoscopic <b>laryngeal</b> examination and <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> revealed a left supraglottic mass. The results of histopathologic examination and immunohistochemical analysis were consistent with atypical carcinoid tumor of the larynx. A TORS-SL was performed. There was no recurrence during a follow-up period of 18 months. NETs of the larynx are a very heterogeneous group of tumors in terms of pathological features and biological behavior.

Three in situ and 5 ex vivo larynges were imaged using a 0. 3 Tesla system. Images were obtained in the transverse plane using T 1 -weighted 3 D spin echo, T 2 -weighted 3 D spin echo, T 2 -weighted gradient echo, short tau inversion recovery (STIR), and proton density spin echo sequences. Five ex vivo larynges were also imaged in the transverse plane using a 1. 5 Tesla system, sequences included T 1 -weighted 3 D spin echo, T 2 -weighted 3 D turbo-spin echo, turbo inversion recovery (TIRM), and proton density spin echo sequences. A frozen gross laryngeal specimen was sliced in 5 -mm transverse sections for comparison to the MR images. Excellent correlation was found between MR images and the gross transverse sections. Successful imaging was accomplished using both imaging systems; however, the 1. 5 Tesla system yielded superior image resolution. The 0. 3 Tesla imaging system would accommodate the intact equine head, which was not possible using the 1. 5 Tesla MRI system.

40|$|AIMS: To assess fistula track healing after {{infliximab}} treatment using <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging.</b> METHODS: <b>Magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> {{and clinical}} evaluation were performed {{before and after}} three infliximab infusions given over a 6 -week period. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> images were evaluated for abscesses and fistula tracks. Paired <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> image examinations were rated 'better', 'unchanged' or 'worse'. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> and clinical outcomes were then compared. RESULTS: Of the 12 referred patients, pre-treatment <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> detected abscesses in three (two not treated). Of the 10 treated patients, seven had peri-anal fistulas, two of whom also had recto-vaginal fistulas, and three had abdominal wall entero-cutaneous fistulas. After infliximab, four were in remission, one had a response and five were non-responders. One developed a peri-anal abscess. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> improved in six, was unchanged in two and was worse in two. In {{four of the six}} with improvement in <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging,</b> the fistula track resolved, but two of these had clinically persistent entero-cutaneous fistulas. The clinical outcome and <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> correlated in seven of the 10 patients; in three (two entero-cutaneous and one peri-anal), there was discordance.

40|$|Aim of {{the study}} was to assess the {{different}} roles of <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> and computed tomography in the evaluation of anatomical origin and pathological nature of lesions involving the masticator space. Overall 41 cases (31 computed tomography and 14 <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging)</b> of lesions involving masticator space were retrospectively reviewed by two experienced radiologists in consensus. Reference standards were histopathological results and clinical-radiological follow-up after one year. Both computed tomography and <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> were performed with and without intravenous injection of contrast. Computed tomography and <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> were correct in identifying the space of origin of lesions respectively in 96 % and 92 % of cases. Computed tomography correctly diagnosed the nature of lesions in 81 % of cases and <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> in 93 % of cases; computed tomography and <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> correctly characterized, respectively, 88 % and 100 % of malignant lesions and, respectively, 73 % and 83 % of benign lesions. In conclusion both computed tomography and <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> were effective in the identification of the origin of non-extensive lesions involving masticator space. Computed tomography was more precise in depicting lesions originating from masticator space, while <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> was more correct in depicting lesions originating from contiguous spaces and involving secondarily the masticator space. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> should always be preferred to characterise lesions, nevertheless computed tomography should be chosen in cases with suspected inflammatory involvement of mandible bone...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Physicians {{evaluating}} hamstring strains {{in professional}} football players are increasingly turning to <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> {{to support the}} clinical diagnosis {{and management of the}} injury. However, little information is available to assess how <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> compares with the clinical evaluation in establishing the duration of rehabilitation required. HYPOTHESIS: <b>Magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> of hamstring strains can be useful in determining duration of rehabilitation. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study (Diagnosis); Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: Fifty-eight professional football players with a diagnosis of hamstring injury made by the team physician were enrolled in the study. All players underwent <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> and a clinical evaluation by an independent physical therapist within 3 days of the injury. Presence, type, and location of injury were recorded in each examination. The physical therapist estimated the time required until return to competition, and the radiologist used the length of the injury (coronal view) to establish rehabilitation duration. Both clinicians were blinded to the other modality. RESULTS: Clinical and <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> assessments were in agreement in 38 of 58 cases (65. 5 %). In 18 cases (31. 0 %), a clinically positive diagnosis was made, but no abnormalities were evident on <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging.</b> In 2 cases (3. 4 %), <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> detected an injury, whereas the clinical examination had negative or equivocal findings. Both clinical examination and <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> findings were strongly correlated with the actual time required to return to competition (r =. 69, P <. 001 and r =. 58, P <. 001, respectively).

40|$|The {{relationship}} between changes in functional <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> and neuronal activity remains controversial. Data collected during awake neurosurgical {{procedures for the}} treatment of epilepsy provided a rare opportunity to examine this relationship in human temporal association cortex. We obtained functional <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> blood oxygen dependent signals, single neuronal activity and local field potentials from 8 to 300 Hz at 13 temporal cortical sites, from nine subjects, during paired associate learning and control measures. The relation between the functional <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> signal and the electrophysiologic parameters was assessed in two ways: colocalization between significant changes in these signals on the same paired associate-control comparisons and multiple linear regressions of the electrophysiologic measures on the functional <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> signal, across all tasks. Significant colocalization was present between increased functional <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> signals and increased local field potentials power in the 50 – 250 Hz range. Local field potentials power greater than 100 Hz was also a significant regressor for the functional <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> signal, establishing this local field potentials frequency range as a neuronal correlate of the functional <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> signal. There was a trend for a relation between power in some low frequency local field potentials frequencies and the functional <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> signal, for 8 – 15 Hz increases in the colocalization analysis and 16 – 23 Hz in the multiple linear regression analysis.

40|$|PURPOSE: Using endoanal <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging,</b> atrophy of the {{external}} anal sphincter can be established. This aspect has not been thoroughly investigated using three-dimensional anal endosonography. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare prospectively three-dimensional anal endosonography to <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> in the detection of atrophy and defects of {{the external}} anal sphincter in patients with fecal incontinence. In addition, we compared both techniques for anal sphincter thickness and length measurements. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with fecal incontinence underwent three-dimensional anal endosonography and <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging.</b> Images of both endoluminal techniques were evaluated for atrophy and defects {{of the external}} anal sphincter. External anal sphincter atrophy scoring with three-dimensional anal endosonography depended on the distinction of the external anal sphincter and its reflectivity. External anal sphincter atrophy scoring with <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> depended on the amount of muscle and the presence of fat replacement. Atrophy score was defined as none, moderate, and severe. A defect was defined at anal endosonography by a hypoechogenic zone and at <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> as a discontinuity of the sphincteric ring and/or scar tissue. Differences between three-dimensional anal endosonography and <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> for the detection of external anal sphincter atrophy and defects were calculated. In addition, we compared external anal sphincter thickness and length measurements in three-dimensional anal endosonography and <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging.</b> RESULTS: Eighteen patients were included (median age, 58 years; range, 27 - 80; 15 women). Three-dimensional anal endosonography and <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> did not significantly differ for the detection of external anal sphincter atrophy (P = 0. 25) and defects (P = 0. 38). Three-dimensional anal endosonography demonstrated atrophy in 16 patients, <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> detected atrophy in 13 patients. Three-dimensional anal endosonography agreed with <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> in 15 of 18 patients for the detection of external anal sphincter atrophy. Using the grading system, 8 of the 18 patients scored the same grade. Three-dimensional anal endosonography detected seven external anal sphincter defects and <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> detected ten. Three-dimensional anal endosonography and <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> agreed on the detection of external anal sphincter defects in 13 of 18 patients. Comparison between three-dimensional anal endosonography and <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> for sphincter thickness and length measurements showed no statistically significant concordance and had no correlation with external anal sphincter atrophy. CONCLUSION: This is the first study that shows that three-dimensional anal endosonography can be used for detecting external anal sphincter atrophy. Both endoanal techniques are comparable in detecting atrophy and defects of the external anal sphincter, although there is a substantial difference in grading of external anal sphincter atrophy. Correlation between three-dimensional anal endosonography and <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> for thickness and length measurements is poor.

RESULTS: Computed tomography showed inner ear malformations in all eight affected patients. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> was performed on five patients and showed inner ear malformations. To define hypoplasia or congenital enlargement of the inner ear structures, measurements obtained from a control group of normal subjects were used for comparison. Almost symmetrical cochlear abnormalities were observed on the three-dimensional Fourier transformation-constructive interference in steady state images of the five patients who underwent <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> imaging; four had dysplasia of the cochlea, and one had hypoplasia. The vestibule was slightly enlarged in one patient; computed tomography and <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> showed semicircular canal malformations. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> clearly showed bilateral enlarged endolymphatic sacs and ducts, whereas computed tomography showed only unilateral widening of the vestibular aqueduct and borderline widening of the vestibular aqueduct. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> showed bilateral hypoplasia of the cochlear branch of the eighth nerve in one patient.

Methods: Fourteen patients with tumours or vascular malformations underwent functional <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> (in the course of motor, sensory, and language tasks) and had structural <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> scans in a 1. 5 T scanner. The functional <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> findings were then correlated with their operative and clinical outcomes. Seven patients had a craniotomy with general anaesthesia, three had awake craniotomy with intraoperative mapping, two had radiosurgery, and two had no surgery. Results: The technical success rate of functional <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> signal activation in identifying eloquent cortices was 100 % for all tasks except Chinese reading, for which the success rate was 83 %. Functional <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> mapping accuracy was determined by correlation with intraoperative cortical stimulation or somatosensory-evoked potentials phase reversal. Surgical decision making was influenced by functional <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> in 75 % of the patients, using a more aggressive approach in two patients and a safer approach in two others (due to lesion proximity of 2 cm) or contralateral location of the language centre. In one patient, there were conflicting results between Wada test and functional <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> with respect to speech lateralisation; intraoperative cortical stimulation found that functional <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> correctly predicted the side of speech dominance. Conclusion: Blood oxygen level–dependent functional <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> had a high technical success rate and was very accurate in mapping eloquent cortical areas preoperatively.

In 19 patients (73 %), overestimation of size was seen exclusively on <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging.</b> For tumors under- or overestimated by <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging,</b> the mastectomy rates were 56 % and 65 %, respectively, compared to an overall mastectomy rate of 43 %. Of 51 patients diagnosed with multifocal disease on pathology, 19 (37 %) were diagnosed by mammogram or ultrasound and 40 (78 %) by <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> resulting in a total detection rate of 84 % (43 patients). Fourteen (3 %) patients were diagnosed preoperatively with contralateral disease. Of those tumors, all were detected on <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> but seven (50 %) were also detected on mammogram or ultrasound or both. Our results suggest that routine use of <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> may result in both under- and overestimation of tumor size and increase mastectomy rates in a small proportion of patients. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> aids in the diagnosis of contralateral and multifocal disease...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveOne of the {{deficiencies}} of {{positron emission tomography}} for N staging in lung cancer is a false-positive result caused by concurrent lymphadenitis. Recently, diffusion-weighted <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> {{has been reported to}} be able to image tumors of body organs. The aim {{of this study is to}} examine the usefulness of diffusion-weighted <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> for N staging of non–small cell lung cancer compared with positron emission tomography–computed tomography. MethodsBoth positron emission tomography–computed tomography and diffusion-weighted <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> were prospectively used in 88 patients before surgical intervention for non–small cell lung cancer to examine 734 lymph node stations. The diagnostic results of positron emission tomography–computed tomography and diffusion-weighted <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> were compared. The diameters of the metastatic foci within lymph nodes were measured on hematoxylin and eosin–stained sections to compare the detectable size of metastatic foci between positron emission tomography–computed tomography and diffusion-weighted <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging.</b> ResultsThe accuracy of N staging in the 88 patients was 0. 89 with diffusion-weighted <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging,</b> which was significantly higher than the value of 0. 78 obtained with positron emission tomography–computed tomography (P =. 012), because of less overstaging in the former. Among the 734 lymph node stations examined pathologically, 36 had metastases, and the other 698 did not. Although there was no significant difference in the diagnosis of the 36 metastatic lymph node stations between the 2 methods, diffusion-weighted <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> was more accurate for diagnosing the 698 nonmetastatic stations than positron emission tomography–computed tomography because of fewer false-positive results (P =. 002). The detectable size of metastatic foci within lymph nodes was 4 mm in both positron emission tomography–computed tomography and diffusion-weighted <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging.</b> ConclusionsDiffusion-weighted <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> can be used in place of positron emission tomography–computed tomography for N staging of non–small cell lung cancer with fewer false-positive results compared with positron emission tomography–computed tomography...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: We {{developed}} {{an effective way}} to precisely diagnose prostate cancer using a novel prostate biopsy system that integrates pre-interventional <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> with peri-interventional ultrasound for perineal navigated prostate biopsy. Materials and Methods: A total of 106 men with findings suspicious for prostate cancer (median age 66 years, prostate specific antigen 8. 0 ng/ml and prostate volume 47 ml) underwent multiparametric 3 Tesla <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging.</b> Suspicious lesions were marked and data were transferred to the novel biopsy system. Using a custom-made biplane transrectal ultrasound probe mounted on a stepper we gathered 3 -dimensional ultrasound data and fused them with <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> data. As a result, suspicious <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> lesions were superimposed over the transrectal ultrasound data. Three-dimensional biopsy planning was done, including systematic biopsies. Perineal biopsies were taken under live ultrasound guidance and the precise site of each biopsy was documented in 3 dimensions. We evaluated feasibility, safety and cancer detection. Results: Prostate cancer was detected in 63 of 106 patients (59. 4 %). <b>Magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> findings correlated positively with histopathology in 71 of 103 patients (68. 9 %). In <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> lesions marked as highly suspicious, the detection rate was 95. 8 % (23 of 24 cases). Lesion targeted cores had a significantly higher positivity rate than nontargeted cores. The procedural targeting error of the first 2, 461 biopsy cores was 1. 7 mm. regarding adverse effects, 2 patients' experienced urinary retention and 1 had a perineal hematoma. Urinary tract infections did not develop. Conclusions: Perineal stereotactic prostate biopsies guided by the combination of <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> and ultrasound enable effective examination of suspicious <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> lesions. Each biopsy core taken is documented accurately for its location in 3 dimensions, enabling <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> validation and tailored treatment planning.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In a {{prospective}} cohort study, the authors followed 112 women whose Poly Implant Prothèse silicone breast implants were recalled. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> results and clinical consequences were previously published. The authors compared <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> screening with explantation results {{to study the}} diagnostic value of <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> in this unique unselected and nonbiased group. METHODS: ONE HUNDRED TWELVE: women with 224 proven Poly Implant Prothèse implants after a mean implantation time of 10 years were enrolled in 2011. All women underwent <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> screening and were offered explantation. The explantation details of 107 women could be compared with <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> results. RESULTS: Of 107 women, 29 (27 percent) {{had at least one}} ruptured implant at explantation, and 44 of 214 explanted implants (21 percent) were ruptured. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> results correctly diagnosed 154 intact and 35 ruptured implants. Sensitivity and specificity were 80 percent and 91 percent, respectively. The positive predictive value was 69 percent, and the negative predictive value was 95 percent. CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> is comparable to previously published data from other manufacturers of modern silicone implants but lower than that of some recent validation studies in selected symptomatic women. The authors believe that this study is representative of common daily practice as they followed normal day-to-day <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> protocol without using multiple independent readers. The authors hope that this study will contribute to the ongoing discussion to screen asymptomatic women with modern silicone breast implants.

40|$|STUDY DESIGN. A {{controlled}} prospective blinded study. OBJECTIVES. To {{compare the}} diagnostic power of myelography, computed tomography and <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> {{in the diagnosis}} of low lumbar disc herniation. METHODS. Eighty patients with monoradicular sciatica were examined by myelography, computed tomography, and <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging,</b> and all underwent subsequent surgery. The images were evaluated twice in a blinded fashion, and the diagnostic power of the modalities was expressed by a decision-analytic regret function. RESULTS. In 57 patients (71 %) a disc herniation at the expected level was disclosed at surgery. The largest amount of diagnostic information was gained from computed tomography, followed by <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> and myelography. Both computed tomography and <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> were significantly informative, whereas {{this was not the}} case for myelography. CONCLUSION. The results indicate that computed tomography or <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> should be the first choice for imaging in patients with suspected lumbar disc herniation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objective: To compare {{intraoperative}} {{measurements of}} the knee with those obtained by <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging,</b> in order to validate the latter method for use in anthropometric studies. Materials and Methods: We studied 20 knees in 20 patients with osteoarthritis, all of whom underwent total arthroplasty between August and December of 2013. We took six measurements in the distal femur and two in the proximal tibia. Using the information system of the institution, we made the measurements on <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> scans that had been obtained in the axial plane. Intraoperative measurements were obtained using a caliper, after the initial cuts made during the arthroplasty. The anatomical parameters determined by <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> {{were the same as}} those determined by intraoperative measurement. The intraclass correlation coefficient was used in order to assess the level of agreement in anthropometric {{measurements of the}} knee performed by <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> and by intraoperative measurement. Results: Statistical analysis revealed a highly significant correlation between the knee anthropometric parameters of the knee determined by intraoperative measurement and those determined by <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging.</b> Conclusion: The dimensions of osteoarthritic knees measured by <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> were similar to those measured intraoperatively. Therefore, <b>magnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>imaging</b> can be considered a reliable method for use in large-scale anthropometric studies that will allow the available implants to be adapted and improved...|$|R
