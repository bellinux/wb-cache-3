In the second sentence of the passage, the Narrator discusses the times when the man does not want to <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> but <b>the</b> desire (“the horses”) then overwhelms him and in <b>looking</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> he attains <b>the</b> happiness he desired. The imagery of “horses ... draging ... him into the train or their wagons ... towards the harmony of man” show the break of our solitude character's life being ripped through <b>the</b> <b>window</b> he will never cross.|$|R
