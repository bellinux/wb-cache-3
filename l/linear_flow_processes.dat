40|$|Due {{to the new}} <b>linear</b> <b>flow</b> {{splitting}} forming <b>process</b> {{the production}} of bifurcated profiles from sheet metal without lamination of material becomes feasible. The continuous production of such structures takes place incrementally in a modified roll forming machine. By producing those complex parts process-related changes in the material properties occur {{as a result of}} the cold forming. Thus, the assumption of homogeneous properties in the processed part is not valid and a reliable analysis of structural durability is only possible by considering changes in material properties. Investigations on <b>linear</b> <b>flow</b> split profiles show large gradients in the microstructure and properties over the profile cross section. In the areas of low plastification the degree of deformation and the flow stress can be determined by microstructure and hardness measurements. In the severely deformed areas, like the upper flange surface, this determination becomes doubtable. Therefore the electron backscattered diffraction method was used to investigate, if an ultrafine-grained structure is occurring as it evolves in the processes of severe plastic deformation. Thus, the aim of this paper is the numerical analysis of the <b>linear</b> <b>flow</b> splitting <b>process,</b> the metallographic characterisation of bifurcated profiles and the numerical evaluation of the structural durability with consideration of the gained insights...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Linear</b> <b>flow</b> {{splitting}} {{is a new}} continuous {{cold forming}} process where {{the edge of a}} sheet metal is formed into two flanges by splitting and supporting rolls. Thus the production of bifurcated profiles from sheet metal without lamination of material becomes feasible. The production of such structures takes place incrementally in a modified roll forming machine. Experimental investigate-ons on a HSLA steel show, that even at a surface increase of the sheet edge of about 1800 % no cracks were nucleated in the profiles. EBSD measurements in the splitting centre reveal that similar to other SPD processes UFG microstructures develop in the processing zone. Thus a steady state is reached in the processing zone where increasing strain has no more (or little) influence on the materials properties i. e. its deformability, as it is typical for SPD-processes. The formation of UFG microstructures {{is considered to be a}} mandatory condition for the <b>linear</b> <b>flow</b> splitting <b>process,</b> as it improves the formability of the material to the extremely high level required for this process. The mechanical properties of profiles produced by <b>linear</b> <b>flow</b> splitting are characterised by large gradients, depending on the local deformation and the resulting microstructure. Very high hardness is measured at the former processing zone, i. e. the splitting centre and the flange surface, where severe plastic deformation takes place and UFG microstructures are present.

40|$|A newly {{developed}} cold forming <b>process,</b> the <b>linear</b> <b>flow</b> splitting <b>process,</b> allows the bifurcation of thin metal sheets by severe plastic deformation (SPD). This process produces flanges with an ultra-fine grained (UFG) microstructure, which {{is characterized by}} an increased hardness and lower surface roughness {{in comparison to the}} material in as-received state. The technology is researched within the Collaborative Research Centre 666 (CRC 666) "Integral Sheet Metal Design with Higher Order Bifurcations". The increased hardness and reduced surface roughness of the flanges make this technology suitable for manufacturing linear guide rails. In order to achieve the required reliability and fatigue strength, the assessment of the performance of the linear flow-split profiles with gradient microstructure is of great importance. When considering rolling contact fatigue, the examination of the mechanical behavior of the side of the flange with higher hardness due to the UFG microstructure is required. In order to reduce time and costs, a numerical method to determine the rolling contact fatigue behavior would be useful minimizing the normally applied experimental effort. The present work aims to check the applicability of the local strain approach for the evaluation of the rolling contact fatigue behavior of <b>linear</b> <b>flow</b> split components by a Finite Element (FE) analysis. The Hertzian theory is only valid for homogeneous materials and cannot be directly applied to the flanges with gradient microstructure. Therefore an accurate modeling of the material in order {{to take into account the}} gradient in the mechanical properties is required. In this paper the characterization of the material behavior under axial cyclic loading will be presented. These results will be used for the Bergmann damage parameter to analyze the rolling contact fatigue behavior. Some parameters required for the application of the Bergmann approach are determined by a numerical simulation of the rolling contact. Results are compared to rolling contact fatigue tests performed on a recently developed test rig under the assumption of rolling without sliding and neglecting the effect of surface roughness and residual stresses...|$|R
40|$|The thesis aims at {{studying}} and comparing different methods for fatigue life evaluation with particular attention on random loading case. This work {{is part of}} a project regarding the newly developed cold forming <b>process,</b> the <b>linear</b> <b>flow</b> splitting <b>process.</b> This process allows the bifurcation of thin metal sheets by severe plastic deformation. The material used is ZStE 340 (European equivalents: HC 340 LA), a microalloyed steel with high yield strength for cold forming. A large number of experimental tests (uniaxial, stress and strain controlled cyclic loading under constant and variable amplitudes) has been performed. The experimental part of the work has provided experimental data for the subsequent validation of fatigue life evaluation methods. Moreover, it has allowed to investigate cyclic properties of ZStE 340, both in as-received state and after the <b>linear</b> <b>flow</b> splitting <b>process.</b> Regarding cyclic properties, strain softening and ratcheting features have been clearly observed for the material ZStE 340 under uniaxial cyclic tests at room temperature. Ratcheting is defined as the accumulation of secondary deformation proceeding cycle by cycle under stress-controlled conditions. In particular, papers on ratcheting state this phenomenon occurs only with non zero mean stress. In this work, a full description of ratcheting has been provided for ZStE 340. Perfomed tests have allowed to study its relation to the applied mean stress, stress amplitude and stress ratio. In particular, compressive ratcheting for negative mean stress and unexpected ratcheting with zero mean stress have been observed. A similar behavior has been reported only by Yaguchi for 9 Cr- 1 Mo steel, by Park for Inconel 718 and by Lim for Elbrodur-NIB, though at high temperatures. A tension-compression asymmetry is believed to cause ratcheting under zero mean stress. Further studies are expected to clarify this phenomenon. Regarding fatigue life evaluation methods, the most representative ones have been considered, following Fatemi's classication: Smith-Watson-Topper parameter; Vormwald model, based on fracture mechanics of short cracks; Chaboche Non-Linear-Continuous-Damage (NLCD) model, supported by Continuum Damage Mechanics; Ellyin method as representative for energy-based damage theories. Moreover, a graphical user interface (GUI) using MATLAB has been built. This procedure allows fatigue life evaluation, by taking as input the same file required by the test machine and the user can select any method among those above-mentioned. By comparing experimental data with results from considered methods, Chaboche model seems to be the most suitable in the evaluation of fatigue life for ZStE 340. In all these methods, an important input {{has been found to be}} the material stress-strain response, especially considering these strong strain softening and ratcheting features. Analyzed methods consider a material stress-strain response which do not reflect satisfactorily the actual material behavior. For this purpose, a semi-empirical new method has been formulated. The new method is based on the framework of non-linear kinematic hardening theory and it should improve the fatigue life method accuracy. Further studies will be carried out to validate its effectiveness. In conclusion, a better comprehension of cyclic behavior for ZStE 340 has been reached with emphasis on its ratcheting feature. A rare phenomenon, ratcheting with zero mean stress, has been observed. The main fatigue life evatuation methods have been studied and compared with experimental data, both in constant and variable amplitude. Chaboche Non-Linear-Continuous-Damage (NLCD) model shows the best agreement with experimental data for ZStE 340. A new method has been formulated aiming at improving fatigue life method accuracy...|$|R
