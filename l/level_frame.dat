40|$|The Energy Information Administration (EIA) weekly {{survey of}} {{gasoline}} prices produces estimates of gasoline pump {{prices at the}} national and regional levels, as well as estimates for several states and cities, two formulations and three grades of gasoline. This survey originated {{as a response to}} the First Gulf War and was later expanded to monitor the effects of the Clean Air Act on the price of gasoline. The original design was a two-phase sample, with a monthly survey’s sample of gasoline refiners and resellers serving as the first phase, and the individual gasoline stations owned by the monthly respondents serving as the second. Subsequent expansions to produce estimates at lower geographic levels required the use of two cycles of the monthly survey sample and the Census County Business Patterns database. The most recent expansion of state and city estimates, however, required a new approach to the sampling frame and sample design. The new design is a two-stage sample where the first stage is an area sample in which counties are selected and the second stage is the sample of stations from the selected counties. The design made use of a newly constructed outlet <b>level</b> <b>frame</b> [...] However, because the old corporate <b>level</b> <b>frame</b> and the new outlet <b>level</b> <b>frame</b> approached the population differently, the potential existed for discontinuity in the survey estimates.

They do not, however, give detailed guidance for application developers, and {{there is a great deal}} of relatively unexplored territory, with just a few markers where people have successfully been before.

40|$|The method, the {{procedure}} {{and the results}} of the calibration of a low cost MEMS INS sensor are described and discussed. The reduced cost of the MEMSs sensors is very advantageous, but these sensors are characterized by much large errors. The accurate calibration of the sensors is very important for the determination of the systematic errors, like bias, scale factor and misalignment of the axes. For this aim, it has been used the multi-position calibration method, which doesn’t require the precise aligned mounting of the sensors with either local <b>level</b> <b>frame</b> or to the vertical direction. The equations in the static case, for the accelerometers sensors are shortly described; the results obtained with the Kalman filter in the experimentation of the tri-axial sensor ADIS 16350 are then illustrated. 1...|$|E
40|$|Video-on-Demand {{applications}} emerge on campuswide networks. Compressed {{video streams}} pass switches {{which do not}} have any bandwidth reservation mechanism, nor any other mechanism against congestion. The switches, shared among video servers, WWW servers and clients, get easily congested in critical situations, hence the switches drop packets and the quality of end-to-end delivery service degrades. To provide soft bandwidth (QoS) guarantees for video, we designed and tested through simulation a dynamic end-to-end multi-path protocol for video traffic. We compared our dynamic multi-path protocol performance with a dynamic single-path protocol and the experiments show significant advantages of the dynamic multi-path communication with respect to provision of soft bandwidth guarantees for video traffic. A disadvantage of our approach is the reordering overhead. However, the use of the higher <b>level</b> <b>frame</b> information helps to simplify reordering and the overhead is acceptable. 1 Introduction [...] ...|$|E
40|$|From past {{numerical}} {{research and}} small scale laboratory tests, {{it has been}} observed that more excess pore water pressure (EPWP) is generated during earthquakes in a heterogeneous sand deposit than in the corresponding homogeneous sand with relative density equal to the average relative density of the heterogeneous sand. This interesting phenomenon is investigated here in large scale experiments using geotechnical centrifuge modeling techniques. A series of liquefaction tests have been conducted at C-CORE’s geotechnical centrifuge facility: Two on variable sand and one on uniform sand deposits. A one <b>level</b> <b>frame</b> structure resting on two strip footings was also placed on that sand deposit to study the effect of soil variability on building foundations. Experimental results such as accelerations, EPWPs and settlements were monitored and measured throughout the tests. Recorded results support the conclusion of previous research that more EPWP is generated in heterogeneous sand deposits than in the corresponding homogeneous sand. The liquefaction mechanism of heterogeneous sands leading to this phenomenon is discussed in this paper...|$|E
