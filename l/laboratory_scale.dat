25|$|The main {{difference}} between <b>laboratory</b> <b>scale</b> distillation and industrial distillation is that <b>laboratory</b> <b>scale</b> distillation is often performed batch-wise, whereas industrial distillation often occurs continuously. In batch distillation, {{the composition of}} the source material, the vapors of the distilling compounds and the distillate change during the distillation. In batch distillation, a still is charged (supplied) with a batch of feed mixture, which is then separated into its component fractions which are collected sequentially from most volatile to less volatile, with the bottoms (remaining least or non-volatile fraction) removed at the end. The still can then be recharged and the process repeated.|$|E

Consequently, model-based prediction of erosion are beneficial of variety of applications. Process-based erosion models are used to forecast sediment transport concentrations as they vary temporally and spatially. Of these, the one-dimensional Hairsine-Rose model describes multiple particle size classes, rainfall detachment, flow-driven entrainment and deposition [1 - 3]. This model has been evaluated for different experiments, and {{has been shown to}} explain reliably experimental data in a consistent manner. In addition, recently it has been coupled with St. Venant equations, to facilitate the application of this model to complex scenarios [4].

25|$|The primary {{objective}} of a belt press filter is to dewater process sludge {{and much of}} this dewatering occurs in the gravity drainage zone. The gravity drainage zone can achieve a 5 to 10 percent increase in solids concentration. The degree of dewatering in the gravity drainage zone is greatly dependent {{on the type of}} solids, the filter media and the sludge conditioning. The dewatering achieved in the gravity drainage zone is adversely affected if the sludge is poorly spread across the belt or the residence time is insufficient. Sludge conditioning is the addition of chemicals to promote flocculation of particles to form a thickened sludge and to promote dewatering. Dewatering can be promoted by the addition of surfactant and flocculation is achieved via the addition of high molecular weight polymer. Flocculation is improved with optimum polymer dosage, polymer dilution and mixing. The pH of the feed slurry must also be monitored and controlled as low pH decreases flocculation. It is important to find the optimum value for each conditioning parameter as too much polymer or mixing can {{have a negative impact on}} flocculation and greatly increase operating expenses. The effects of sludge conditioning are most apparent in the gravity drainage zone which can be easily replicated on a <b>laboratory</b> <b>scale</b> where the optimum conditioning strategy can be determined. For a belt press filter to be industrially viable it must be economically efficient and thus maximum throughput is desired. Without sufficient conditioning, the gravity drainage is generally the limiting process step, but with optimum dilution the limiting process step can be shifted to the compression zone.|$|E

2500|$|Given its {{economic}} importance, indigo has been prepared by many methods. The Baeyer-Drewson indigo synthesis {{dates back to}} 1882. It involves an aldol condensation of o-nitrobenzaldehyde with acetone, followed by cyclization and oxidative dimerization to indigo. This route is highly useful for obtaining indigo {{and many of its}} derivatives on the <b>laboratory</b> <b>scale,</b> but was impractical for industrial-scale synthesis. Johannes Pfleger and Karl Heumann (...) eventually came up with industrial mass production synthesis. The first commercially practical route is credited to Pfleger in 1901. In this process, N-phenylglycine is treated with a molten mixture of [...] sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and sodamide. This highly sensitive melt produces indoxyl, which is subsequently oxidized in air to form indigo. [...] Variations of this method are still in use today. [...] An alternative and also viable route to indigo is credited to Heumann in 1897. [...] It involves heating N-(2-carboxyphenyl)glycine to [...] in an inert atmosphere with sodium hydroxide. The process is easier than the Pfleger method, but the precursors are more expensive. [...] Indoxyl-2-carboxylic acid is generated. [...] This material readily decarboxylates to give indoxyl, which oxidizes in air to form indigo. [...] The preparation of indigo dye is practiced in college laboratory classes according to the original Baeyer-Drewsen route.|$|E
