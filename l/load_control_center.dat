The relationship between heavy cognitive <b>load</b> and <b>control</b> of <b>center</b> of mass are heavily correlated in the elderly population. As cognitive load increases, the sway in center of mass in elderly individuals increases.

40|$|Abstract — With the {{integration}} of renewable energy sources and large-scale smart buildings, the electricity grid becomes more prone to instabilities due to unexpected fluctuations in energy consumption. Data centers are a type of smart building because of their innate automation and controllable <b>load.</b> <b>Load</b> <b>controlling</b> in data <b>centers</b> has been studied extensively with scheduling/migration, peak power shaving, load shifting, etc. However, previous studies have not considered how changes in data center power consumption may impact {{the stability of the}} electric grid. This paper first shows that well-known power management mechanisms in data centers may lead to voltage instability in the grid. We propose a new method that considers both workload performance constraints and minimizes the instability-causing effects on the grid. Our simulation studies show that our policy can preserve the grid stability 97 % of the time and reduces the maximum instability observed by 27 %, while effectively managing the workload performance.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to assess a new method of <b>controlling</b> <b>load</b> in Intelligent Networks (INs).

The methodology is known as network-orientated <b>load</b> <b>control</b> for the IN.

Traditional <b>load</b> <b>control</b> valves {{do not have}} the <b>load</b> velocity <b>control</b> ability and its opening feature is very poor because the high spring stiffness comes along with the pressure–spring balance–based principle. Some improvement has been done by employing a two-stage pressure–pressure balance principle to make a <b>load</b> <b>control</b> valve to achieve <b>load</b> velocity <b>control</b> ability while the opening feature was not improved much. In this design, another pressure–pressure balance principle is proposed to make the <b>load</b> <b>control</b> valve achieve <b>load</b> velocity <b>control</b> ability and fast opening closing feature at the same time. Static modeling method based on force balance and Bernoulli orifice pressure-flow equation is used to design the <b>load</b> velocity <b>control</b> ability of the valve.

40|$|Abstract—Many {{application}} scenarios envisioned {{as part of}} the “smarter ” grid {{depend on}} an effective underlying communication infrastructure for power distribution. The advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) is one such application scenario where bidi-rectional communication between electric meters of customers and the utility <b>control</b> <b>center</b> is required for demand response and <b>load</b> <b>control.</b> Several technologies have been suggested to meet communication needs for the backhaul that connects customer data collection points with the utility’s <b>control</b> <b>center.</b> In this paper, these technologies are compared with a justification of why wireless communication technologies may be most suitable for the backhaul. A linear chain multihop wireless communication architecture is then proposed, and its ability to meet application requirements of the communication backhaul is evaluated through simulations. Based on capacity limitations first seen in the simula-tion results, a theoretical analysis is done to understand the data carrying capacity of using linear chain wireless technologies for the communication backhaul. Finally, the AMI application sce-nario is used as a case study to understand the implications of any limitations imposed by the proposed communication architecture.

30|$|This {{technical}} solution {{is based on}} the combined use of an AMR system and/or medium to low voltage (MV/LV) power transformer monitoring (left in Fig.  4), home area network (HAN) concept and additional devices (right). At the entrance of each HAN (right), some gateway device or decentralized controller has to be deployed. Within the HAN, appropriate household devices should be used (compatible with load management) along with their Wireless link to the gateway, e.g. using Wi-Fi and ZigBee concept. Connection of PV-panels and arrays is also shown in Fig.  4.
