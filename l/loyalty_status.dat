50|$|Behavioural {{segmentation}} divides consumers {{into different}} groups {{depending on their}} personal knowledge on a product, their attitude towards it, and their response to the product. The sections that behavioural segmentation focuses on are purchase occasions, benefits sought, user status, usage rate, <b>loyalty</b> <b>status,</b> buyer readiness stage, attitude towards the product and online behaviour. This type of segmentation is used to target consumers who {{are more inclined to}} hear and accept the communications from the advertiser and be interested in the product being offered. Behavioral segmentation is important because it examines how the consumer's past buying experiences will affect their future purchases. This means that advertisers should consider their past feedback and responses from consumers when planning any new means of communication.|$|E
5000|$|Consumers {{are divided}} by their knowledge, attitudes, and use of, or {{response}} to, the product (Kotler et al., 2014). Marketers can group buyers {{according to the}} occasion when they made the purchase or used the product. For example, Kotler et al. (2014) suggests that air travel is generated by occasions relative to business, vacation, or family. Another way marketers can group buyers using behavioral variables is user status and usage rate. They can be segmented into nonusers, former users, potential users, first-time users and regular users of a product, (Kotler et al., 2014). Usage rate is the segmentation into light, medium and heavy product users. According to Kotler, et al., (2014) heavy product users are usually {{a small percentage of}} the market but account for a high percentage of total consumption. <b>Loyalty</b> <b>status</b> can prove to be very significant to a marketer’s product or service.

It was desirable to choose a lost-for-good type of service, where commitment is relatively high and service relationships exist. Thereby, bank was chosen, as a combination of a credence- and experience good. The theory chapter starts with addressing loyalty as a concept, with a historical perspective, definition and an explanation of the different loyalty types, initially presented by Allen and Meyer (1990). It was decided to use the term affective loyalty as the term for truly loyal customers, symbolizing the “deeply held commitment” in Oliver’s (1999) loyalty definition. Furthermore, the phenomenon of status quo bias was thoroughly explained as a preference for the current state, where customers usually stay with a provider due to rational decision making, cognitive misperceptions and psychological commitment. The theory further explains how switching costs and lack of viable alternatives, also referred to as continuance loyalty, could explain customers’ intention to stay with their provider. An experimental research design was chosen to detect whether affective <b>loyalty,</b> <b>status</b> quo bias and continuance loyalty has an impact on intention to stay. The effects were tested through a survey, consisting of an experiment to determine status quo bias effects in banking services, and a questionnaire to further map the presence of intention to stay.

In order to tackle this tough situation, they need not only to reduce cost by effectively executing SCM but also to introduce measures to increase profit like CRM.

However, there is no good application that realize both two business practices together. In this study, assuming that RFID system captures consumer behavior information on the sales floor, we propose an application, in which discount prices are offered to FSP member customers based on their loyalty level and the discount prices are computed to achieve a target inventory turnover rate.

The final electoral vote was 180 for Lincoln, 72 for Breckinridge, 39 for Bell, and 12 for Douglas. Although Breckinridge won {{the states of the}} Deep South, his support in those states came mostly from rural areas with low slave populations; the urban areas with higher slave populations {{generally}} went for Bell or Douglas. Breckinridge also carried the border states of Maryland and Delaware. Historian James C.

He lost to Douglas in Missouri and Bell in Virginia and Tennessee. Bell also captured Breckinridge's home state, Kentucky. Lincoln swept most of the northern states, although New Jersey split its electoral votes, giving four to Lincoln and three to Douglas. As the candidate of the Buchanan faction, Breckinridge outpolled Douglas in Pennsylvania and received support comparable to Douglas in Connecticut, although he received very little support elsewhere in the North.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine how the Buddhist and Hindu people in non-Western {{societies}} perceive rational accountability practices in religious organizations, through their respective religious “spirit” and “beliefs” and in combination with broader structural elements of the society. Design/methodology/approach – The interpretive tradition of research, i. e. ethnography based on two in-depth cases from Sri Lanka (a Buddhist temple) and Mauritius (a Hindu temple) is adopted for the data collection. The data are analysed using grounded theory methods and procedures. Findings – In non-Western Buddhist and Hindu societies where people's lives are bound by a high religious “spirit” the accountability system in the religious organisations is largely visible as an informal and social practice rather than a stakeholder-oriented rational mechanism. It is found that the rational accountability mechanisms are “sacredised” by the Buddhist and Hindu religious “spirit” and subsequently, the accountability systems and religious activities are both influenced by the “structural elements” of trust, aspirations, patronage and <b>loyalty</b> relations, social <b>status,</b> power and rivalries. The accountability practices implemented in these organisations are perceived by the people as being no more than “ceremonial rituals” aimed at strengthening the temple's righteous and prudent image to the religious society. Research limitations/implications – The paper raises the issue that accountability practices in community, grassroots-based non-profit organisations are not mere reporting of “facts” relating to economic activities and a “neutral system” giving reasons for the conduct of its leaders. Instead, they initiate new forms of accountability systems and reproduce structural conditions. Originality/value – This is one of the first field studies which examine perceptions of accountability within a Hindu and a Buddhist context, as influenced by the religious “spirit” and internal belief systems of the devotees.

40|$|In this work, we {{examined}} the surprising value consumers attach to getting a bargain. Past research has largely understood this phenomenon {{in terms of the}} impact discounts have on perceptions of fairness. However, the evidence for this explanation is inconclusive due to a number of viable alternatives as well as issues relating to construct and external validity. The experiments we report here provide clearer evidence for the basic assertion that discounts increase purchase satisfaction due to the nonfinancial rewards that are associated with perceptions of fairness. Furthermore, current notions of fairness in the promotion literature are extended by showing that social cues such as the relative size of the discount received by another customer and the <b>loyalty</b> <b>status</b> of that customer can also have an important impact on fairness and purchase satisfaction. We suggest an integration of transaction utility theory (Thaler, 1985) and equity theory (Bagozzi, 1975) to account for these findings. Everybody seems to like getting a bargain. From an economic standpoint, the appeal can be understood in terms of the objective monetary benefits. However, simple observation suggests that bargains may be of broader significance t...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to determine, {{understand}} and describe the acceptability, choice and preference of dairy fruit beverages by a group of black South-African female consumers. Food choice, acceptability and preference are complex and dynamic processes, influenced by various interrelated factors. The study was conducted in two phases. During the first phase a quantitative research approach was followed to collect demographic, purchasing and consumption information of the participants and to determine their hedonic responses towards the dairy fruit beverages by means of standardised sensory evaluation tests. A qualitative research approach was followed during the second phase of the study where focus group discussions were conducted to obtain supportive information for the interpretation and explanation of the data obtained during the first phase of the study. The target population for this study was black adult female consumers. They were chosen because of the high consumption and the popularity of dairy fruit beverages amongst them. The participants were selected from consumers who visited the School of Cookery at a large dairy company in Queensburgh in Kwa-Zulu Natal. The participants all spoke isiZulu and the majority completed Grade 12 or had a tertiary education. The participants were from Durban and surrounding areas. The average age of the participants was 35 years. The purchasing and consumption information revealed that the participants purchased dairy fruit beverages on average once a week from a local supermarket. The dairy fruit beverages were consumed more often in summer and with special occasions (such as birthday parties). The majority of the participants indicated that they preferred to purchase and consume a specific brand. The flavour purchased the most was the pineapple flavour. The results from the preference rating tests indicated that the main discriminating sensory attribute was taste and then flavour. The results from the preference ranking test indicated that the peach flavour was the most preferred fruit flavour. This was in contrast to the purchasing and consumption information which indicated that they mostly buy and consume the pineapple flavour. It was evident from the focus group discussions that all the participants were familiar with dairy fruit beverages and consumed it regularly. This was also supported by the demographic, purchasing and consumption information. The results from the focus group discussions confirmed that taste and appearance are important sensory attributes during food choice. The participants emphasised that the appearance must represent “…real fruit juice…” (it must not look like a soft drink) and must also smell like “…real fruit…”. It was clear that a high price is associated with good quality. Brand <b>loyalty</b> and social <b>status</b> were associated with the dairy fruit beverage brands, and indicated the powerful impact of mass media and advertisements on the perception and choices of dairy fruit beverages. Children were also mentioned as a persuading factor that influenced the choice and purchase of certain brands of dairy fruit beverages. This study contributed to understand and describe the consumer behaviour of the black female consumers in South Africa. The study added support to the implementation of strategic planning in the product development and marketing divisions of a food manufacturing company, to ensure that the consumer is satisfied and that expectations have been met. The quantitative and qualitative results supported and complemented another. Using both quantitative and qualitative research approaches are recommended when cross-cultural consumers in the South African context is the target population.

A structural model of service loyalty highlighting the positive and significant relationships among perceived service quality, customer satisfaction and service loyalty is illustrated, in which customer satisfaction is identified as a significant mediator to enhance the impact of perceived service quality on service loyalty.

While previously HFD considered as an expensive and non-regular drink, now it is being consumed by middle class and even lower-middle-class people as a regular drink for kids. But there is another side of the coin. Growing market competitiveness, the rise of Milk Powder Brands as a competitive force and increasing parallel import are some issue need to be considered. The basic purpose of this research paper is to Identify existing and potential competitors, and their different selling propositions, Understand the impact of gray market and Unleash potential threats and opportunities of this specific market by studying the retail market of HFD in Bangladesh. Another aspect {{of this study is}} to identify the influence of various factors on the buying decision of customers. Paper also attempts to determine the awareness level & <b>loyalty</b> <b>status</b> of consumers. To develop the conclusions exploratory & descriptive research designs are used. Primary data had collected with the help of questionnaire method & data is analyzed with the help of various statistical techniques. Finally, I have put some recommendations by analyzing my data findings from the retail survey, consumer survey and other secondary data analysis. Md. Azimul IslamB. Business Administratio...|$|E
40|$|Customer loyalty {{has been}} a central topic of both {{marketing}} theory and practice for several decades. Customer disloyalty, or relationship ending, has received much less attention. Despite the close relation between customer loyalty and disloyalty, they have rarely been addressed in the same study. The thesis bridges this gap by focusing on both loyal and disloyal customers and the factors characterising them. Based on a qualitative study of loyal and disloyal bank customers in the Finnish retail banking market, both factors that are common to the groups and factors that differentiate between them are identified. A conceptual framework of factors that affect customer loyalty or disloyalty is developed and used to analyse the empirical data. According to the framework, customers’ <b>loyalty</b> <b>status</b> (behavioural and attitudinal loyalty) is influenced by positive, loyalty-supporting, and negative, loyalty-repressing factors. Loyalty-supporting factors either promote customer dedication, making the customer want to remain loyal, or act as constraints, hindering the customer from switching. Among the loyalty-repressing factors {{it is especially important}} to identify those that act as triggers of disloyal behaviour, making customers switch service providers. The framework further suggests that by identifying the sources of loyalty-supporting and -repressing factors (the environment, the provider, the customer, the provider-customer interaction, or the core service) one can determine which factors are within the control of the service provider. Attitudinal loyalty is approached through a customer’s “feeling of loyalty”, as described by customers both orally and graphically. By combining the graphs with behavioural loyalty, seven customer groups are identified: Stable Loyals, Rescued Loyals, Loyals at Risk, Positive Disloyals, Healing Disloyals, Fading Disloyals, and Abrupt Disloyals. The framework and models of the thesis can be used to analyse factors that affect customer loyalty and disloyalty in different service contexts. Since the empirical study was carried out in a retail bank setting, the thesis has managerial relevance especially for banks.
