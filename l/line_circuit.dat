40|$|In this paper, the {{mounting}} grooves and serration patterns of fin <b>line</b> <b>circuits</b> are investigated experimentally. Our measurements {{show that the}} short-circuit ended mounting grooves degrade seriously the insertion loss of fin lines at the low frequencies of the band. The open ended mounting grooves are found better for fin lines applications and measurements. An improvement of 0. 7 dB is observed over the whole band, when the serration patterns of the fin line are placed into the open-ended mounting grooves.

50|$|In most mid-20th-century {{switching}} equipment, {{a permanent}} signal would tie up a junctor circuit, diminishing {{the ability of}} the switch to handle outgoing calls. When flooded cables or other conditions made this a real problem, switch staff would open the cable, or paper the off-normal contacts of the crossbar switch, or block the line relay from operating. These methods had the disadvantage of blocking all outgoing calls from that line until it was manually cleared. Manufacturers also sold devices that monitored the talk wires and held up the cutoff relay or crossbar hold magnet until the condition cleared. Some crossbar <b>line</b> <b>circuit</b> designs had a park condition allowing the <b>line</b> <b>circuit</b> itself to monitor the line.|$|E

40|$|Etectroless {{copper plating}} has been {{proposed}} as a method for producing <b>circuit</b> <b>lines</b> in printed <b>circuit</b> boards (PCB) (1). Fabrication of PCB's by electroless plating offers an important advantage over existing fabrication methods that employ partial or full etching of a blanket copper layer to define the <b>circuit</b> <b>lines.</b> Because isotropic hemical etching processes areused to pattern PCB <b>circuit</b> <b>lines</b> in current fabrication methods, the sidewalls of the <b>circuit</b> <b>lines</b> are eroded as the desired thickness of copper {{is removed from the}} PCB substrate (1). Electroless deposition on the other hand is a totally additive process, so it is possible to form fine-pitch, high-aspect-ratio <b>circuit</b> <b>lines</b> with nearly rectangular cross sections.

50|$|Addressable Fire Alarm Control Panel employ {{one or more}} Signaling Line Circuits - usually {{referred}} to as loops or SLC loops - ranging between one and thirty. Depending on the protocol used, a Signaling <b>Line</b> <b>Circuit</b> can monitor and control several hundred devices. Some protocols permit any mix of detectors and input/output modules, while other protocols have 50% of channel capacity restricted to detectors/sensors and 50% restricted to input/output modules. Each SLC polls the devices connected, which can number from a few devices to several hundred, depending on the manufacturer. Large systems may have multiple Signaling Line Circuits.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantage}} of using commensurate lines {{is that the}} commensurate line theory allows circuits to be synthesised from a prescribed frequency function. While any circuit using arbitrary transmission line lengths can be analysed to determine its frequency function, that circuit cannot necessarily be easily synthesised starting from the frequency function. The fundamental problem is that using more than one length generally requires more than one frequency variable. Using commensurate lines requires only one frequency variable. A well developed theory exists for synthesising lumped element circuits from a given frequency function. Any circuit so synthesised {{can be converted to}} a commensurate <b>line</b> <b>circuit</b> using Richards' transformation and a new frequency variable.|$|E

5000|$|Each line {{switch in}} this first, mixed bay has nine lines on nine of its {{vertical}}s, the tenth vertical being reserved for test purposes. In {{addition to the}} 90 lines on these switches, each LLF {{has at least one}} simple line switch bay, with ten more line switches carrying 200 lines. Thus the minimum size of a LLF is 290 lines for a line concentration ratio of 2.9:1. Optionally it has still another frame, with ten more switches and another 200 lines, and so forth, up to a maximum line concentration ratio of 5.9:1 since they all shared the same hundred line links. The <b>line</b> <b>circuit</b> is much like that in 1XB with a line relay for alerting the exchange to a trip condition, and the vertical off-normal contacts of the switch vertical serving as cutoff relay.|$|E
5000|$|Lengths {{of lines}} in {{distributed}} element circuits, for generality, are usually {{expressed in terms}} of the circuit's nominal operational wavelength, Î». Lines of the prescribed length in a commensurate <b>line</b> <b>circuit</b> are called unit elements (UEs). A particularly simple relationship pertains if the UEs are Î»/8. [...] Each element in the lumped circuit is transformed into a corresponding UE. However, Z0 of the lines must be set according to the component value in the analogous lumped circuit and this may result in values of Z0 that are not practical to implement. This is particularly a problem with printed technologies, such as microstrip, when implementing high characteristic impedances. High impedance requires narrow lines and there is a minimum size that can be printed. Very wide lines, on the other hand, allow the possibility of undesirable transverse resonant modes to form. A different length of UE, with a different Z0, may be chosen to overcome these problems.|$|E

There were a million problems that you would normally take care of when you do your preproduction and pilot run. Basically, customers were shipped the pilot run.|$|E
