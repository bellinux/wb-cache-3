50|$|Turnout was {{particularly}} low in every constituency (from 13 to 28%). A number of expatriates, living far from any polling station, {{said they had}} been unable to vote online, because they had not received the necessary <b>login</b> <b>codes,</b> or because of errors when they attempted to log in and cast their vote. Others said they had abstained deliberately, considering that they should not be voting in an election when the results would primarily affect residents of France. Others considered that the candidates were necessarily ill-suited to represent the interests of expatriates scattered over often vast and diverse territories. Based on projections from the 2007 presidential election results, the carving of constituencies should have resulted in a 9-to-2 division of the seats between the UMP and the Socialists, however French expatriates ended up electing seven Socialists, one Green (Europe Écologie - Les Verts) and three UMP deputies. The results were likely impacted by low turnout and support for Francois Hollande following his presidential election.|$|R

30|$|The {{study sample}} was derived {{out of the}} members of the Dutch {{association}} Balans for parents of children with developmental disorders (amongst others, but not limited to ADHD, Asperger’s syndrome, Dyslexia, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and conduct disorder (CD)). Parents of children with ADHD were asked via the magazine of the association to join the study online by means of a personal <b>login</b> <b>code.</b> Inclusion criterion: being a parent of a child aged 8 – 18 years diagnosed with ADHD. Because of this membership, it was assumed valid to rely on the parents’ knowledge about the ADHD diagnosis of their child. Due to anonymity it was not possible to verify whether the diagnosis was indeed valid.|$|E
30|$|This {{project has}} been {{approved}} by the Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REC) in Norway (REC South East), has permission from The Norwegian Data Protection Authority, and was conducted in accordance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki. All study participants provided their informed consent. Data were collected through the Resource Center for psychological and social factors at work, developed by The National Institute of Occupational Health (NIOH). This is a web-based system for secure administration of questionnaires. The system is developed for the purpose of tracking individuals over time and to couple data to registries in a way that satisfies demands for anonymity and personal security. When accessing the web-based questionnaire by a personal <b>login</b> <b>code,</b> informed consent had to be confirmed before responding to the questionnaire. This consent procedure was considered as equal to a written informed consent. The procedure was approved by The Norwegian Data Protection Authority and REC. Respondents are treated anonymously in the data analyses. Only respondents who actively (by response) permitted the linking of their answers to registries are included in the present project.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{a recent}} {{randomized}} trial, {{we were unable}} to confirm the previously reported high effectiveness of CCBT. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to have a closer look at usage and acceptability (i. e. expectancy, credibility, and satisfaction) of the intervention. METHODS: Depressed participants (N= 200) were given <b>login</b> <b>codes</b> for unsupported online CCBT. A track-and-trace system tracked which components were used. We used a 9 -month follow-up period. RESULTS: Uptake was sufficient, but dropout was high. Many usage indices were positively associated with short-term depressive improvement, whereas only homework was related to long-term improvement. Acceptability was good and expectancy could predict long-term, but not short-term outcome. LIMITATIONS: Associations between use of CCBT and improvement are merely correlational. Our sample was too depressed in relation to the scope of the intervention. We relied on online self-report measures. Analyses were exploratory in nature. CONCLUSIONS: Although CCBT might be a feasible and acceptable treatment for depression, means to improve treatment adherence are needed for moderately to severely depressed individual...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In the Netherlands, {{children}} {{start to}} drink {{at an early}} age; of the Dutch 12 -year olds, 40 % reports lifetime alcohol use, while 9. 7 % reports last-month drinking. Starting to drink {{at an early age}} puts youth at risk of developing several alcohol-related problems later in life. Recently, a home-based prevention program called "In control: No alcohol!" was developed to delay the age of alcohol onset in children. The main aim of this project is to conduct a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the program. Methods/Design The prevention program will be tested with an RCT among mothers and their 6 grade primary school children (11 - 12 years old), randomly assigned to the prevention or control condition. The program consists of five printed magazines and an activity book designed to improve parental alcohol-specific socialization. Parent-child dyads in the control group receive a factsheet information brochure, which is the standard alcohol brochure of the Trimbos Institute (the Netherlands Institute for Mental Health and Addiction). Outcome measures are initiation of alcohol use (have been drinking at least one glass of alcohol), alcohol-specific parenting, susceptibility to drinking alcohol, alcohol expectancies, self-efficacy, and frequency and intensity of child alcohol use. Questionnaires will be administered online on secured Internet webpages, with personal <b>login</b> <b>codes</b> for both mothers and children. Mothers and children in both the experimental and control condition will be surveyed at baseline and after 6, 12, and 18 months (follow-ups). Discussion The present study protocol presents the design of an RCT evaluating the effectiveness of the home-based "In control: No alcohol!" program for 6 grade primary school children (11 - 12 years old). It is hypothesized that children in the prevention condition will be less likely to have their first glass of alcohol, compared to the control condition. When the prevention appears to be effective, it can easily and relatively quickly be implemented as a standard alcohol prevention program on a large scale.

30|$|The {{questionnaire}} was available from 01 - 09 - 2010 until 03 - 10 - 2010. The parent {{taking care of}} the child most of the day was asked to complete the questionnaire. Parents were not reimbursed for their participation in any way. In case the parent had more than one child with ADHD, parents were asked to answer the questions for their youngest child. Since the study did not interfere with clinical practice, according to Dutch regulation no approval of an ethics committee was needed. Also, with the methodology of this study focusing on parents instead of patients, it was not obligatory to use informed consent forms. Nevertheless, the protocol took into account all privacy aspects and all necessary efforts were taken in this study to protect privacy. Participants were informed on the purpose of data collection (scientific publication), respondents were fully free to decide to join and were able to exit the questionnaire at any time. Due to the <b>login</b> <b>code</b> that was distributed by Balans magazine, only members of Balans were able to access the questionnaire. The questionnaire could be completed only once per IP address, but these IP addresses were not saved and/or traceable so participants’ anonymity was guaranteed. Also, adequate security measures were employed in order to prevent unauthorized access, manipulation to or disclosure of the personal data although these were already unidentifiable when stored.|$|E
40|$|At {{a virtual}} {{shareholders}} meeting {{there is no}} physical gathering of shareholders, {{but they will be}} able to assemble and vote via the internet. Together with the notice of the meeting a person can be sent a personal <b>login</b> <b>code.</b> With this code shareholders can access a heavily secured VGM platform where the AGM will take place. At this platform shareholders can find all relevant AGM information, assembly papers and a discussion forum. At the discussion forum shareholders can take cognizance of the discussion and participate therein by asking questions to the board or by reacting to the contributions of other shareholders. Members of the board can answer questions and react to the input of shareholders. Consequently, a constructive dialogue can originate between all participating parties which can contribute to the understanding of shareholders concerning the proposed decision-making. When shareholders have taken a voting decision, they can cast their votes at a separate part of the platform. All participants within the corporation, wherever they reside, are able to join the assembly at a relatively low cost. Since a VGM may last for several days, it is not required that the shareholders are all in front of their computers at the same time. The VGM has three clear advantages: 1. Savings in costs and time. Shareholders can save travelling time while corporations can save on organisation and location costs. Although establishing and using a VGM platform will be costly, a surplus will remain. It is no longer necessary for shareholders and members of the board to reserve a specific day in their diary. In order to follow and participate in the discussion, they only need to log on to the VGM platform on a regular basis. This will most likely result in time savings, but allows shareholders in any event to use their assembly time more flexibly. 2. The second advantage is an improvement in corporate democracy. Shareholders, wherever they reside, are able to join the meeting at relatively low costs. The thresholds for joining the assembly are lowered which may lead to an increase in the representation and participation of shareholders in the decision-making process. Due to the low costs of information distribution, the supply of information may increase and the information asymmetry will diminish. Moreover, the discussion forum offers shareholders new possibilities to provide each other with information and to unite. Shareholders will not receive additional rights, but will be able to exercise their existing rights in a more informed and balanced way. As a result of the more informed and balanced exercise of rights, the antagonism may diminish and the VGM may be, next to face-to-face contact at investor relation meetings, a platform for constructive dialogue between shareholders and members of the board. 3. The third advantage is an improvement in corporate governance. The consequence of a VGM is an improved corporate democracy which enables AGMs to play the role which the legislator and Code intended them to play. If the AGM will indeed fulfil this role, corporate governance will improve...|$|E

40|$|In 2013 Juels and Rivest {{introduced}} the Honeywords System, a password-based authentication {{system designed to}} detect when a password file has been stolen. A Honeywords System stores passwords together with indistinguishable decoy words so when an intruder steals the file, retrieves the words, and tries to log-in, {{he does not know}} which one is the password. By guessing one from the decoy words, he may not be lucky and reveal the leak. Juels and Rivest left a problem open: how to make the system secure even when the intruder corrupted the <b>login</b> server’s <b>code.</b> In this paper we study and solve the problem. However, since “code corruption” is a powerful attack, we first define rigorously the threat and set a few assumptions under which the problem is still solvable, before showing meaningful attacks against the original Honeywords System. Then we elicit a fundamental security requirement, implementing which, we are able to restore the honeywords System’s security despite a corrupted login service. We verify the new protocol’s security formally, using ProVerif for this task. We also implement the protocol and test its performance. Finally, at the light of our findings, we discuss whether it is still worth using a fixed honeywords-based system against such a powerful threat, or whether it is better, in order to be resilient against code corruption attacks, to design afresh a completely different password-based authentication solution...|$|R
