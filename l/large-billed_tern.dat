5|$|Most terns breed on open sandy or rocky {{areas on}} coasts and islands. The yellow-billed, <b>large-billed,</b> and black-fronted <b>terns</b> breed only on rivers, and common, least and little terns also {{sometimes}} use inland locations. The marsh terns, Trudeau's tern and some Forster's terns nest in inland marshes. The black noddy {{and the white}} tern nest above ground level on cliffs or in trees. Migratory terns move to the coast after breeding, and most species winter near land, although some marine species, like the Aleutian tern, may wander far from land. The sooty tern is entirely oceanic when not breeding, and healthy young birds are not seen on land {{for up to five}} years after fledging until they return to breed. They lack waterproof plumage, so they cannot rest on the sea. Where they spend the years prior to breeding is unknown.|$|R
