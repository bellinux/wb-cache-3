5|$|Due to his doping ban, he {{was barred}} from the Olympics, Commonwealth Games, {{and much of the}} European racing circuit, from 2006 to 2012. The Court of Arbitration for Sport {{overturned}} his lifetime Olympic ban, deeming it non-compliant with the World Anti-Doping Code, and he competed in the 2012 London Olympics. He produced a ghost-written autobiography with writer Ken Scott, Race Against Me, in 2009. He is of Afro-Caribbean- Jamaican descent and has two sons with his partner <b>Leonie</b> Daley.|$|E

There he played rugby and tennis for the college, boxed for the university and qualified as a pilot with the Oxford University Air Squadron. He graduated with a second-class Bachelor of Civil Law degree in 1930, and soon after was called to the English bar. He briefly read in London chambers before commencing practice in Bulawayo in 1931. In 1934 he married <b>Leonie</b> Barry, a farmer's daughter from Barrydale in the Cape of Good Hope; they had two daughters.|$|E

The Baron was the Grand Squire of France to Napoleon III; he then served as Inspector of the Haras Equestrian Service before being elected five times as the Député for Nièvre in the French Parliament. De Bourgoing {{attended}} the school for girls of the court at the Tuileries Palace and in 1880, {{at the age of}} 18, married the artillery captain Joseph Antoine Fortoul with whom she had three children: Antoine (1881–1963), Mathieu (1882–1969) and Victoire (1887–1888), who died when she was only 20 months old.|$|E

50|$|Most of {{the action}} {{takes place in the}} Domaine de la Cade, a stately home in Rennes-les-Bains, which in 1891 is owned by <b>Léonie's</b> {{deceased}} uncle Jules and his wife Isolde, whom Anatole later marries.

5|$|A {{right-handed}} {{batter and}} wicket-keeper, {{she is the}} daughter of Greg Healy, who was part of the Queensland squad, while her uncle Ian Healy was Australia's Test wicket-keeper and held the world record for the most Test dismissals. Healy first came to prominence in late 2006 when she became the first girl to play among boys in the private schools' competition in New South Wales. She moved up the state age group ranks and made her debut for the senior New South Wales team in the 200708 season. She played most of her first two seasons as a specialist batsman due to the presence of <b>Leonie</b> Colemana wicket-keeper for Australiain the state side. Coleman left New South Wales {{at the start of the}} 200910 season and Healy took up the glovework on a full-time basis for her state. During the same season, she recorded her highest score of 89 not out at faster than a run a ball, and made the most dismissals of any wicket-keeper in the Women's National Cricket League.|$|E
5|$|At the World Indoor Championships 60 metres final, Chambers won {{a silver}} medal and {{recorded}} a new personal best of 6.54s to take second behind Olusoji Fasuba. The performance did not sway opinion: Chambers continued to encounter extensive criticism within athletics. Promoters did not invite him to key athletics events, Eddie Kulukundis – who had supported Chambers earlier in his career – refused to sponsor the sprinter, and the British Olympic Association (BOA), prevented him from competing in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. To return to the track Chambers {{had to rely on}} the money he received from his partner, <b>Leonie</b> Daley, a civil servant whom he met at the Miss Jamaica UK competition. The couple now had a child, a boy named Skye who was born in September 2005, and Chambers desperately needed to earn a living to support his family and pay off debts incurred through the drug ban. He amassed a selection of cuttings about his fall from grace and the BALCO Scandal in order to show his son the risks of drug abuse.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 200708 season, she made her senior debut for the New South Wales Breakers in the Australian {{domestic}} one-day league. She was used as a specialist batsman in the top-order, as <b>Leonie</b> Coleman, a wicket-keeper in the Australian squad, also played for New South Wales. She made her debut against South Australia and was unsuccessful to begin with, scoring only 24 runs in her first five innings. After one month at senior level, she broke through with a match-winning performance in her sixth senior game. After Queensland had made 170, Healy came in with the score at 5/99 after 32 overs, with 18 overs remaining. She raised the run rate, scoring 41 not out from 50 balls, with eight fours, shepherding the tail-enders and guiding her state to a two-wicket win with 17 balls to spare.|$|E
50|$|Paws and Whiskers is a 2014 {{fundraising}} anthology for the Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, featuring some of {{the best}} children's stories about cats and dogs of all time, selected by multi-award-winning and best-selling children's author Jacqueline Wilson, with illustrations by Nick Sharratt. Published 13 February 2014 by Doubleday Children's, the book includes a new story by Wilson, <b>Leonie's</b> Pet Cat, as well as extracts from such classics as The Hundred and One Dalmatians, by Dodie Smith, and Through the Looking Glass by Lewis Carroll.|$|R
50|$|<b>Leonie’s</b> {{third album}} - The Naked Sessions - reproduces the {{atmosphere}} of her live shows. With more acoustic arrangements her voice unfolds to already known songs like Voor jou vecht ik and Het staat in de sterren. However it is the new songs that stand out, including White Ribbons, written by her after {{the sinking of the}} MH17 along with songwriter Jud Friedman (who previously worked with Whitney Houston, Barbra Streisand and Rod Stewart). The record features a version of True Colours and a very intimate cover of the Italian classic Caruso.|$|R
5000|$|On January 24, 2015 her beatification process {{began in}} France with the {{declaration}} of [...] "nihil obstat" [...] (nothing against), thus conferring upon her the posthumous title of the Servant of God. This allowed for a local diocesan process to open in order to gather documentation and testimonies about <b>Léonie's</b> life and writings; the local process was opened in the chapel of the Visitation at Caen on 2 July 2015. Prayers are now being offered {{for her to be}} declared [...] "Venerable," [...] the next step on the road to beatification.|$|R
5|$|On 1 January 1949, King married divorceé Anita Leslie (Anita Theodosia Moira Rodzianko King 1914–1984). She was {{the eldest}} child of Sir John Randolph Shane Leslie, 3rd Baronet {{and his wife}} Marjorie Ide, the Vermont-born {{daughter}} of the US ambassador to Spain. Bill and Anita probably met in Lebanon in 1943, where King served for 5 months as {{executive officer of the}} submarine base at Beirut. She was on a skiing trip after doing duty in Africa in the Motor Transport Corps in 1940–42, although a letter mentions her being in Beirut in 1941–42. Leslie-King then became an ambulance driver in the French Army from 1944 to 1945. For the latter, she was awarded the Croix de Guerre in 1945 by General Charles de Gaulle. As Anita Leslie, she wrote over a dozen books, including Love in a Nutshell (1952), The Remarkable Mr. Jerome: The Life and Times of Leonard Jerome, Sir Winston Churchill's American Grandfather (1954). In 1974 she wrote the biography of Francis Chichester, the first person to sail around the world single-handedly with only one stop. The Kings had two children, Richard Tarka Bourke King (b. 1949), and <b>Leonie</b> Rose King (b. 1951).|$|E

50|$|In 1890, Victor and <b>Léonie's</b> son Edmond brought {{international}} fame to the Champagne House. He even {{penetrated the}} very close {{circle of the}} suppliers to the Court of Tsar Nicolas II of Russia. After Edmond secured a contract to be the official supplier of Champagne to the Romanov king, Canard-Duchêne adopted the Russian Imperial coat of arms {{as part of its}} logo, the two-headed eagle. The symbol of the two-headed eagle is itself steeped in history: {{it is one of the}} oldest symbols of the duality of power of the emperor over both the state and the church, dating right back to the Byzantine period.|$|R
2500|$|Noguchi {{returned}} to New York amidst the Great Depression, finding few clients for his portrait busts. Instead, {{he hoped to}} sell his newly produced sculptures and brush paintings from Asia. Though very few sold, Noguchi regarded this one-man exhibition (which began in February 1932 and toured Chicago, the west coast, and Honolulu) as his [...] "most successful". Additionally, his next attempt to break into abstract art, a large streamlined figure of dancer Ruth Page entitled Miss Expanding Universe, was poorly received. In January 1933 he worked in Chicago with Santiago Martínez Delgado on a mural for Chicago's Century of Progress Exposition, then again found a business for his portrait busts; he moved to London in June hoping to find more work, but returned in December just before his mother <b>Leonie's</b> death.|$|R
500|$|After <b>Leonie's</b> {{death in}} 1953, Beadle married Olive Jackson, of Salisbury, in 1954. He later {{said that he}} was {{repeatedly}} asked to resign from the bench to become the Federal Minister of Law or stand for Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia, but [...] "didn't regard any of the issues as crucial enough to warrant my going back". Beadle's biographer Claire Palley describes him as [...] "a learned, fair but also adventurous judge". He was appointed CMG in 1957. In August 1959, amid rising black nationalism and opposition to the Federation, particularly in the two northern territories, Beadle chaired a three-man tribunal on the Southern Rhodesian government's preventive detention of black nationalist leaders without trial during the disturbances. He upheld the government's actions, reporting that the Southern Rhodesia African National Congress had disseminated [...] "subversive propaganda", encouraged racial hatred, intimidated people into joining and undermined the authority of tribal chiefs, government officials and police.|$|R

40|$|Des mots mangeables : la gelée comme synecdoque du style dans le roman proustien On edible words: jelly as synecdoche {{of style}} in the Proustian novelIn aunt <b>Léonie's</b> room in Combray The air becomes denser and clearer, like an “industrious, crystal clear jelly". Françoise is able to carve her braised beef’s jelly as Michelangelo sculpted Carrara marble. The good, old French of the Duchesse de Guermantes and of Francoise, so evocative of them both, is only to be found now in old recipe books in which only "les gelees, le beurre, le jus et les quenelles are authentic.

The sixteen uses of the noun “gelée” in A la Recherche du Temps perdu are not {{sufficient}} to explain the role of this image in Proust's theorization of style. It is well known that he dislikes having labels put on to his prose. The aim {{of this article is to}} analyse the narrative situations and stylistic configurations in which "la gelée" operates as a synecdoche of Proust's entire aesthetic theory as it is proposed in his novel. The concept of configuration adopted here is that proposed by Joelle Gardes in her last book on rhetoric...|$|R
