40|$|The authors present two {{clinical}} studies {{performed in the}} ENT departments of two Belgian Universities. A total of 248 patients with mucoviscidosis (cystic fibrosis, CF) were assessed by means of nasal endoscopy. One hundred eighteen underwent computed tomography of the paranasal sinuses (CT) and 55 were endoscopically operated. This allowed the observation of different clinical patterns of rhinosinusitis: mucopyosinusitis (pseudomucocele) of the maxillary antrum with bulging of the lateral nasal wall (LNW), nasal polyposis with erosion of the LNW, and chronic purulent rhinosinusitis with an isolated prominent uncinate process. The treatment of those patients could be tailored to the individual clinical pattern. Medical therapy consisted of systemic antibiotics and topical drugs delivered by sprays or by lavages with a nose can. Surgery was mainly aimed at removing the massive polyposis when it interfered with the daily life activities. The use of the endoscope enabled to perform safely more extensive procedures resulting in a lower recurrence rate. In patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without polyposis, yet presenting ostiomeatal obstruction, a limited and more functional endoscopic surgery was indicated in order to restore some drainage and to improve the penetration of topical drugs into the affected sinus.

40|$|The {{offshore}} {{industry is}} constantly seeking {{to operate in}} more extreme conditions. DeepOcean is a subsea service company, where offshore lifts {{is a part of}} every day operations. To remain competitive, it is important to reduce operational downtime, where time spent waiting on weather {{is one of the main}} contributors. The main goal of this thesis is to investigate how shielding effects influence the operational limit for offshore lifting operations at different heading angles. Common practice in the offshore industry is to use long-crested waves when determining the operational limit, and shielding effects are often neglected, which is a conservative approach. A case study of two different structures, a Manifold and a ROV system, has been conducted. Repeated launch and recovery analyzes has been performed in Orcaflex, a time domain finite element program developed for static and dynamic analysis of offshore systems. Irregular waves are applied using a JONSWAP spectrum with $T_{p}= 5 - 19 s $ and $H_{s}= 1 - 4 m$ for the Manifold and $H_{s}= 2 - 8 m$ for the ROV system. Both long- and short-crested waves, as well as 4 heading angles have been investigated. Shielding effects has been accounted for by the use of Sea State RAOs calculated in WADAM, a hydrodynamic analysis program for calculation of wave-structure interaction. The maximum tension in the lifting wire is considered as the dimensioning parameter. Gumbel extreme value statistics has been used to evaluate the distribution of maximum lifting wire tension, based on 20 simulations per sea state. The calculated maximum wire tension was found to be highly dependent on whether or not slack would occur during a simulation. A slack wire result in snap loads with unpredictable magnitude. Incorporation of shielding in the simulations resulted in a significant drop in the occurrence of slack, for both structures. Thus, shielding effects is found to reduce the uncertainty related to the maximum tension due to a reduction in snap loads. The operational limit for the Manifold was increased with 0. 5 - 1. 0 m on average when shielding was included for most periods and heading angles, for both <b>long-and</b> <b>short</b> crested waves. The results obtained for the ROV was found to be highly unpredictable in magnitude due to slack occurring in the dominating part of the simulations, especially for steep waves.

40|$|Since the 1994 {{publication}} of 'Bringing It All Back Home', commentators have raised {{a variety of}} questions and criticisms. Subsequently published applications of our book 9 ̆ 2 s new class theory of households, by ourselves and others, have raised new issues not foreseen when we first developed the theory. In this paper we will address the major points of these reactions in ways that extend the class analysis of households well beyond our book and the literature it provoked and informed. The following topic areas will sequentially structure our presentation: children, interactions between the class structures of households and of enterprises, the class complexity of the household budget, class contradictions between households and enterprises, fathers 9 ̆ 2 household labor, and when children become household serfs. A <b>short</b> <b>addendum</b> addresses households from which class is absent because production there has dwindled and only consumption remains. Analyzing these new topics broadens and deepens two central points of our 1994 work. First, by conceiving class processes and contradictions and struggles over class as components of households, we can explore how class directly affects all the other, nonclass dimensions of those households: affective, marital, political, sexual, parental, financial, and so forth. We can show in particular how the class structure of households influences in contradictory ways (1) parents 9 ̆ 2 rearing of children, (2) household budgets, and (3) father 9 ̆ 2 s household labor. Our analysis demonstrates and underscores how the good and bad of family life are intimately connected to class.

40|$|The {{electronic}} {{version of}} this thesis differs slightly to the print version. Some typographical corrections {{were made to the}} text in October 1995. In 1997 a small amount of additional evidence came to light and is referenced in a <b>short</b> <b>addendum</b> to Chapter 10. This thesis examines the relationships between the development of transport systems and manufacturing technology, and the effect of these and other factors on industrial location within cities. To study these relationships in isolation from the effects of state planning, the focus is the evolution of Sheffield's steel industry from 1800 - 1914, and the consequences for the emerging city. Industrial location and urban theories are compared, and the psychology underlying decision making is discussed. Variables proposed by these theories as influences on location decisions are reviewed, including accessibility and transport costs; technological and organisational change; urban infrastructure; the influence of land owners and markets on land supply; and topography and environmental issues. Sheffield's topography, communications, industrial and urban growth are described. The distribution of the steel industry is plotted decennially. Contemporary data suggesting the reasons for location decisions are analysed. There follow examinations of local goods distribution, and how the extension of public transport affected labour mobility. Two case studies explore the development of an industrial suburb by the Dukes of Norfolk, and the establishment of a large steel works. The thesis concludes that industrialists usually perceived their location decisions to be economically rational - a weighing up of variables including:- balancing the cost and convenience of goods transport within the wider production function; access to labour; the unfettered ability to pollute; availability of large, level sites; and some intangible factors. The scale of a plant was significant in determining whether a company required (or could afford) direct rail access, and railways priced services to discriminate in favour of firms with such access. Landowners co-operated with the industrial land market, but also influenced it, planning for industrial development; controlling land uses; and reserving sites speculatively. This restricted the ability of the steel industry to choose sites freely, and develop rational plant layouts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Planetary {{gear drive}} with minor teeth {{difference}} (zd≤ 8) {{is one of}} the advanced transmitting styles and could meet the requirement of larger ratio in a smaller size of dimension. Generally the gears with addenda modifications play a principal role in planetary gear drive of minor teeth difference to avoid teeth interference during the mesh, and this transmission implies cumbersome parameters calculations and brings up higher angle of engagement to affect the load capacity because of life weakening on carrier bearings involved. In fact, provided some certain promise, zero addenda modification (viz. X-zero) drive with minor teeth difference could also qualify for gearing conditions so as to reduce the complicacy of calculations and angle of engagement mentioned above.
