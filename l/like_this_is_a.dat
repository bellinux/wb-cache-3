He compared the plot to Lost, remarking [...] "Apparently one thoroughly confusing and unnecessarily convoluted TV series wasn't enough... But hey, I understand why J.J. and his Fringe collaborators... {{might have done}} this. They had kind of written themselves into a corner {{where one of the}} universes had to go, and they couldn't stretch that storyline out forever. A restart <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> good way to allow themselves room to write something new, even if it may require some clever thinking to explain themselves out of this situation adequately."

"Unbroken" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by OneRepublic leader Ryan Tedder, {{who was behind}} singles such as Beyoncé Knowles' [...] "Halo" [...] (2009) and Leona Lewis' [...] "Bleeding Love" [...] (2007).

Walker told the Daily Telegraph, [...] "It is a privilege for me to record a song by the guy who wrote 'Halo' for Beyoncé and 'Bleeding Love' for Leona. He's the man, {{one of the best}} songwriters and producers in the world. I am so blessed." [...] In an interview with MTV Australia he said, [...] "The song is so amazing. When I first heard the song I was <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> beat song and then I read the lyrics and that's what won me over because it talks about my life, being nothing and being in pieces, but then becoming unbroken."

500|$|Despite her largely demure {{public persona}} as a {{traditional}} wife and homemaker, Nixon was not as self-effacing and timid as her critics often claimed. When a news photographer wanted her to strike yet another pose while wearing an apron, she firmly responded, [...] "I think we've had enough of this kitchen thing, don't you?" [...] Some journalists, such as columnist and White House Correspondent Robert Thompson felt that Pat was an ideal balance for the 1970s; Thompson wrote that she proved that [...] "women can {{play a vital role}} in world affairs" [...] while still retaining a [...] "feminine manner." [...] Other journalists felt that Pat represented the failings of the feminine mystique, and portrayed her as being out of step with her times. Those who opposed the Vietnam War identified her with the Nixon administration's policies, and, as a result, occasionally picketed her speaking events. After she had spoken to some of them, though, one student told the press that [...] "she wanted to listen. I felt <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> woman who really cares about what we are doing. I was surprised." [...] Veteran CBS correspondent Mike Wallace expressed regret that the one major interview he was never able to conduct was that of Pat Nixon.|$|E

Although she also cited the need to put a face to gays and lesbians, her primary reason was to bring attention to the gay adoption issue. O'Donnell is a foster and adoptive mother. She protested against adoption agencies, particularly in Florida, that refused adoptive rights to gay and lesbian parents.|$|E
2500|$|Although most reviews were favorable, Mama's Gun {{was not as}} {{successful}} with consumers and critics as Baduizm had been; Q wrote that Badu's debut had raised expectations she did not meet on Mama's Gun, while Entertainment Weekly said it was plagued by [...] "a reactionary pseudo-sophistication that too often substitutes good taste for good tunes." [...] According to Badu in an interview {{a few months after}} the album's release, [...] "it has sold 1.4 million in the US. So no, it didn't sell as much ... although creatively I feel <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> better piece of work."

2500|$|Martin {{continued}} his review in part two, where he lauded {{the writing of}} Sinon's backstory and sufferance of PTSD as [...] "masterful", writing [...] "The way she falls apart even in her Sinon persona {{when faced with a}} particular stressor is quite credible, as is the way she struggles to cope with her crushing fear; she is desperately afraid to die, but even more afraid of living with the fear [...] almost seems like a deliberate message is being sent to the audience, and the way she finally finds her resolve and fights back when her life is in serious jeopardy is heartening." [...] He also praised Michelle Ruff's voice acting in the English dub. Anime News Network's Rebecca Silverman also praised Sinon's portrayal, noting her to be [...] "a much more interesting character" [...] than both Kirito or Asuna, as [...] "what makes Sinon a more successful character than any to previously appear in the main series is that she has more depth. Rather than being just a scared or traumatized character, she's someone who is actively working to change herself [...] it feels <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> turning point for Kawahara's writing skill. Sinon isn't perfectly depicted, but she's got more going on than previous characters." [...] Sam of The Otaku's Study similarly noted how Sinon already established herself as [...] "one of the most developed Sword Art Online characters" [...] despite appearing in only 7 episodes thus far, praising her backstory and contrast between her in-game and out-of-game personas.|$|E
500|$|Anderson {{sought to}} capture the nostalgic feel of the 1950s. In this effort, he used several themes {{associated}} with the time period, including alien invasion movies, nuclear threats, Cold War paranoia, and optimism in the future. About the time period, Anderson said [...] "it seemed <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> time when you could say with a straight face, 'I'm fighting for truth, justice and the American way.'" [...] For the characters Anderson was picturing George Reeves's Superman and Noel Neill's Lois Lane as portrayed in the 1950s television series Adventures of Superman. One reviewer noted that Anderson's portrayal of Lex Luthor {{is that of the}} post-Crisis on Infinite Earths amoral businessman and Batman was more reminiscent of a 1930s-style or a [...] ""-style Batman where he is actively pursued by the police.|$|R

While fairy stories can teach us valuable lessons, give us characters to relate to, and inspire us with wonder and joy, there are also certain dangers associated with reading fairy tales.
