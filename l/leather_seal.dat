50|$|This forward-moving barrel {{has given}} rise to the view that the Gat is not an air weapon at all, but simply a spring catapult. This is incorrect. The piston is a <b>leather</b> <b>seal</b> around the outside of the inner barrel, running in a larger {{concentric}} cylinder within the receiver. The barrel and piston are driven forward when fired, air passing into the chamber from two small transfer ports drilled {{at the rear of the}} barrel, just ahead of the <b>leather</b> <b>seal.</b>|$|E
50|$|However Brunel was {{concerned}} about the efficiency of available steam locomotives, and he had been interested in the 1840 demonstration of the atmospheric system at Wormwood Scrubs. The system is fully described in the article Atmospheric railway and in the technical section below. Briefly, it involves a pipe laid between the running rails, and stationary steam engines located at intervals of a few miles along the line; they exhaust air from the pipe, forming a partial vacuum. A piston carriage is placed at the head of each train, and it carries a piston which travels in the tube. The tube is slotted at the top to enable the piston bracket to pass, and a continuous <b>leather</b> <b>seal</b> prevents unwanted admission of air. With a partial vacuum in the pipe ahead of the piston, the pressure of the atmosphere behind it drives it forward, drawing the train. The <b>leather</b> <b>seal</b> is opened by rollers immediately ahead of the bracket carrying the piston, and closed immediately behind it.|$|E
50|$|The {{device was}} hell on pellets, blowing out {{their heads and}} leaving the bodies trapped in the barrel, so round balls were the only {{recommended}} ammo. It also blew the <b>leather</b> <b>seals</b> out of the early guns. It {{was very difficult to}} get medical ether ampules, so the system was never popular.|$|R
50|$|The flanchards, used {{to protect}} the flank, {{attached}} {{to the side of}} the saddle, then around the front or rear of the horse and back to the saddle again. These appear to have been metal plates riveted to leather or in some cases cuir bouilli armour (which is boiled or treated <b>leather</b> <b>sealed</b> with beeswax or the like).|$|R
50|$|The {{atmospheric}} railway {{opened on}} 30 May 1846 and ran between Exeter St. Davids and Newton Abbot. The first passenger train ran in September 1847, but {{the project was}} besieged with problems mainly with the <b>leather</b> <b>sealing</b> valve, which after 12 months of use needed replacing {{at a cost of}} £25,000. South Devon Railway directors abandoned the project in favour of conventional trains: the last atmospheric train ran in September 1848.|$|R
50|$|The {{submarine}} was 10 feet, 6 {{inches long}} by 27 inches high by 25 {{inches wide and}} displaced about six tons when submerged. She was equipped with eight dead-lights on top to provide interior light, and a top hatch with a retractable conning tower for surface navigation. For propulsion, she had three sets of duck-foot paddles and a large rudder. She was also equipped with hatches with <b>leather</b> <b>seals</b> {{in order to make}} possible some manipulations outside the hull, a small ballast system with a lever and piston, and a 50 lb anchor. The ship had a complement of three men.|$|R
50|$|The HW (Hermann Weihrauch) 35 was {{the first}} air rifle with Weihrauchs famous Rekord 2-stage {{adjustable}} trigger and used a conventional piston and spring assembly. The spring is compressed by breaking the barrel through 125° before loading a pellet directly into the breach. The barrel was then returned into place and locked with a special Breech lock. The first production models had a <b>leather</b> piston <b>seal</b> with a 4mm diameter transfer port {{but at the end}} of the 1970s Weihrauch switched to synthetic seals and a 2.8mm dia port from serial #843636.|$|R
5000|$|SVT {{worked with}} Garden State Tanning {{to produce the}} Mystichrome leather found on the car's seat inserts and the {{steering}} wheel at the 10, 2, and 6 o'clock positions. The production process for the Mystichrome leather included tanning and dying the leather jet black, spraying the Mystichrome paint directly onto the <b>leather,</b> and <b>sealing</b> it with a clear layer to protect and prevent damage to the Mystichrome-painted leather. Like the 2003 10th Anniversary Cobra, the Mystichrome Cobra featured a steering wheel with grip humps at the 10 and 2 o'clock positions. The Mystichrome Cobra came standard with the five-spoke 17" [...] chrome wheels.|$|R
50|$|During {{the winter}} of 1847-1848 the leather flap valve that sealed the {{traction}} pipe slot began to give trouble. During the cold days of winter the leather froze hard in frost after saturation in rain. This resulted in its failing to seat properly {{after the passage of}} a train, allowing air into the pipe and reducing the effectiveness of pumping. In the following spring and summer there was hot and dry weather and the leather valve dried out, with pretty much the same outcome. Brunel had the leather treated with whale oil in an attempt to maintain flexibility. There was said to be a chemical reaction between the tannin in the leather and iron oxide on the pipe. There were also difficulties with the <b>leather</b> cup <b>seal</b> on the pistons.|$|R
50|$|DOBAG carpets are {{delivered}} both with a <b>leather</b> tag and <b>seal</b> {{attached to the}} carpet for identification, {{as well as with}} a certificate stating the weaver's name, village, and region where the carpet was woven. DOBAG carpet weavers are paid per knots, thus ensuring a fair wage system. Once a carpet has been sold, the weaver is granted an additional bonus. The commercial branch of the initiative directly exports the carpets to authorized dealers only, thus avoiding intermediate trade.|$|R
5000|$|When Viscount Howick became {{persuaded that}} his {{objections}} to the Newcastle and Berwick Bill in Parliament were unlikely to prevail, he instead proposed a rival line, the Northumberland Railway, which would pass clear of the estate, to the west. Isambard Kingdom Brunel was engaged to engineer the line, {{and he decided to}} adopt the atmospheric system. This involved the laying of a tube between the rails; a partial vacuum was created in the tube by static pumping stations, and each train was headed by a [...] "piston carriage" [...] which carried a piston running in the tube. A <b>leather</b> flap <b>sealed</b> the necessary slot in the tube before and after passage of the train. The atmospheric system avoided the weight of a locomotive and its fuel and water in the train formation, and was in use without apparent difficulty on the Dalkey Atmospheric Railway.|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} the Privy Seal of Japan {{dates back to the}} Nara period. Although it was {{originally}} made from copper, it was manufactured from stone in 1868 (Meiji) and later, was made from pure gold. The present Privy Seal is pure gold and is about 3 sun (about 9 cm) in size and weighs 4.5 kg. The master-hand of the seal was Abei Rekido (安部井 櫟堂; 1805-1883), of Kyoto. He was commissioned to manufacture the State Seal of Japan within one year, in 1874 (Meiji 7). When not in use, the seal is kept in a <b>leather</b> bag. The <b>seal</b> is used with special cinnabar seal ink specially made by the National Printing Bureau.|$|R
50|$|Classic {{lamellar}} armour {{was made}} from hard materials (initially from natural materials like bone, tusk, baleen, and even wood as arrow-heads initially were from bone or stone) and {{in the shape of}} a short cuirass or even consisted only of a breast-plate. While laminar armour {{was made from}} hardened <b>seal</b> <b>leather</b> and often knee long, or even longer. However late lamellar armour made from metal (iron or steel or even brass) and could be as long as laminar armour. Both lamellar and laminar armour usually were worn with a high collar (protecting neck and head) integral with one or two laminar pauldrons (used rather as shield than ordinary pauldron). This collar and its pauldrons usually were made from leather and wood.|$|R
50|$|The {{technology}} {{required the}} use of <b>leather</b> flaps to <b>seal</b> the vacuum pipes. The natural oils were drawn out of the leather by the vacuum, making the leather vulnerable to water, rotting it and breaking the fibres when it froze {{during the winter of}} 1847. It had to be kept supple with tallow, which is attractive to rats. The flaps were eaten, and vacuum operation lasted less than a year, from 1847 (experimental service began in September; operations from February 1848) to 10 September 1848. Deterioration of the valve due to the reaction of tannin and iron oxide has been cited as the last straw that sank the project, as the continuous valve began to tear from its rivets over most of its length, and the estimated replacement cost of £25,000 was considered prohibitive.|$|R

40|$|Keywords: Implicature, Relevance Theory, and MovieImplicature is {{what the}} addresser wants to convey without stating it explicitly. In this study, the writer intends to analyze an implicature in Megamind Movie using Relevance Theory. This study is {{conducted}} to find out (1) the explicature conveyed in the utterances of the main character in Megamind movie. (2) The implicated premises and implicated conclusion conveyed in the utterances of the main character in Megamind movie. The writer uses Sperber and Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s theory in analyzing the data. This study is qualitative study since the writer analyzed utterances taken from the dialogue of the main characters in Megamind Movie. Research design is document analysis. From the data obtained, the writer {{tried to find out}} the explicature, implicated premise, and implicated conclusion based on Relevance Theory proposed by Sperber and Wilson (1995). In this study the writer found 14 utterances that convey an implicature. To answer research problem the writer gave an example from the conversation that were taken from datum 2. The context of this conversation is when Megamind crashing Metroman 2 ̆ 7 s Memorial Day by kidnapping Roxanne Ritchi. Metroman is threatening Megamind to put him into jail by saying We all know how this ends, with you behind the bars. The word ‘we 2 ̆ 7 refers to Metroman and all the citizen of Metro city, while ‘this 2 ̆ 7 refers to the battle between Megamind and Metroman. The last, ‘you 2 ̆ 7 refers to Megamind. Then, Megamind responses Metroman 2 ̆ 7 s threat by saying Oh, I am shaking in my custom baby seal-leather boot. The word ‘I 2 ̆ 7 refers to Megamind. From the explicature, Megamind responds may irrelevant. But it conveys an implicature. There are many causes to make people shaking and that creates the implicated premises; Megamind is shaking because it is cold; Megamind is shaking because of terrifying; Megamind is shaking just because he wants to; Megamind is shaking just because he pretends to be. From the implicated premise. It may seem that Megamind terrifies being threatened by Metroman, but in reality Megamind does not fear at all. The intended meaning is he just pretending to be and mocking Metroman by showing his baby <b>seal</b> <b>leather</b> boot. Thus the implicated conclusion is Megamind does not fear of Metroman. The writer draws conclusion that Relevance Theory is concern with ostensive communication that is intentional communication through an addressee that can understand the speaker 2 ̆ 7 s thought. This study hopefully can provide appropriate references for further researcher to conduct the research in implicature. It is recommended for the next researchers to conduct similar studies to be analyzed using Relevance Theory with different object such as novel, magazine or even article...|$|R
