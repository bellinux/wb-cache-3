5|$|After 1916, Roon was {{disarmed}} {{and used}} as a guard ship and floating barracks in Kiel {{until the end of}} the war. Design work commenced in 1916 to convert the ship into a seaplane carrier; work was planned to <b>last</b> <b>from</b> 1917 to 1918 during a period of 20 months. The ship was struck from the naval register on 25 November 1920 and scrapped the following year at Kiel-Nordmole.|$|E
5|$|Courtship {{is often}} aerial and often {{involves}} pheromones. Butterflies then {{land on the}} ground or on a perch to mate. Copulation takes place tail-to-tail and may <b>last</b> <b>from</b> minutes to hours. Simple photoreceptor cells located at the genitals are important for this and other adult behaviours. The male passes a spermatophore to the female; to reduce sperm competition, he may cover her with his scent, or in some species such as the Apollos (Parnassius) plugs her genital opening to prevent her from mating again.|$|E

5|$|Of Stanford's other orchestral works, his six Irish Rhapsodies all {{date from}} the 20th century, the first from 1901 and the <b>last</b> <b>from</b> the year before his death. Two of the set feature solo {{instruments}} along with the orchestra: the third (cello) and the sixth (violin). In Dibble's view some of the concertante works such as the First Piano Concerto (1894) and the Violin Concerto (1899) are in their orchestration and their lyricism {{as much in the}} tradition of Mendelssohn as of Brahms, with whom Stanford's music is often compared.|$|E

5|$|Radiotherapy is {{used when}} drug {{treatment}} is failing {{to control the}} pain of a growing tumor, such as in bone metastisis (most commonly), penetration of soft tissue, or compression of sensory nerves. Often, low doses are adequate to produce analgesia, thought {{to be due to}} reduction in pressure or, possibly, interference with the tumor's production of pain-promoting chemicals. Radiopharmaceuticals that target specific tumors have been used to treat the pain of metastatic illnesses. Relief may occur within a week of treatment and may <b>last</b> <b>from</b> two to four months.|$|E
5|$|The 11 Canis-Minorids, {{also called}} the Beta Canis Minorids, are a meteor shower that arise near the fifth-magnitude star 11 Canis Minoris and were {{discovered}} in 1964 by Keith Hindley, who investigated their trajectory and proposed a common origin with the comet D/1917 F1 Mellish. However, this conclusion has been refuted subsequently {{as the number of}} orbits analysed was low and their trajectories too disparate to confirm a link. They <b>last</b> <b>from</b> 4 to 15 December, peaking over 10 and 11 December.|$|E

5|$|Adult males enter a {{state of}} {{increased}} testosterone known as musth. In a population in southern India, males first enter musth {{at the age of}} 15, but it is not very intense until they are older than 25. At Amboseli, bulls under 24 do not go into musth, while half of those aged 25–35 and all those over 35 do. Young bulls appear to enter musth during the dry season (January–May), while older bulls go through it during the wet season (June–December). The main characteristic of a bull's musth is a fluid secreted from the temporal gland that runs down the side of his face. He may urinate with his penis still in his sheath, which causes the urine to spray on his hind legs. Behaviours associated with musth include walking with the head held high and swinging, picking at the ground with the tusks, marking, rumbling and waving only one ear at a time. This can <b>last</b> <b>from</b> a day to four months.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} the ship was in poor shape and {{required}} an extensive refit; the work <b>last</b> <b>from</b> 12 November to 17 May 1944 at the North Woolwich, London shipyard of Harland and Wolff. After working up, she {{was assigned to the}} 14th Escort Group for anti-submarine operations in the Western Approaches. Duncan conducted convoy escort and anti-submarine operations with the group through April 1945 when she was assigned to the Greenock Coastal Escort Pool. The ship was placed in reserve on 13 May and was transferred to Barrow on 9 June. She approved for immediate disposal on 8 July as she was leaking five tons of water a day. Duncan was turned over to BISCO for scrapping immediately afterwards, but demolition was not completed until 1949.|$|E
5|$|Females {{typically}} {{lay between}} {{four hundred and}} three thousand eggs. The eggs are often dropped {{onto the surface of}} the water; sometimes the female deposits them by dipping the tip of her abdomen into the water during flight, releasing a small batch of eggs each time, or deposits them in bulk while standing next to the water. In a few species, the female submerges and places the eggs among plants or in crevices underwater, but in general, they sink to the bottom. The incubation time is variable, depending at least in part on temperature, and may be anything from a few days to nearly a year. Eggs can go into a quiet dormant phase or diapause. The larval growth rate is also temperature-dependent, as is the number of moults. At anywhere between ten and fifty, these post-embryonic moults are more numerous in mayflies than in most other insect orders. The nymphal stage of mayflies may <b>last</b> <b>from</b> several months to several years, depending on species and environmental conditions.|$|E

5|$|Archaeologists {{divide the}} pre-European American contact {{period of the}} region into three {{cultural}} phases. The Crane Flat phase <b>lasted</b> <b>from</b> 1000BCE to 500CE and is marked by hunting with the atl atl {{and the use of}} grinding stones. The Tarmarack phase <b>lasted</b> <b>from</b> 500 until 1200, marked by a shift to using smaller rock points, indicating development and use of the bow and arrow. The Mariposa phase <b>lasted</b> <b>from</b> 1200 until contact with European Americans.|$|R
5|$|Like Castile soap, {{the chief}} {{ingredients}} of Nabulsi soap are virgin olive oil, water, and an alkaline sodium compound. The compound {{is made by}} mixing the powdered ashes of the barilla plant (qilw) which grows {{along the banks of}} the River Jordan with locally supplied lime (sheed). The sodium compound is then heated with water and the olive oil in large copper vats over fermentation pits. The solution of water and the sodium compound becomes increasingly concentrated in a series of 40 cycles repeated over eight days. During that time, an oar-shaped wooden tool known as a dukshab is used to stir the liquid soap continuously. The liquid soap is then spread in wooden frames to set. After setting, it is cut into the classic cube shape of Nabulsi soap and stamped with the company's trademark seal. The soap cubes then undergo a drying process which can <b>last</b> <b>from</b> three months to a year and involves stacking them in ceiling-high structures resembling cones with hollow centers which allow the air to circulate around the cubes.|$|E
5|$|No.285 Squadron {{generally}} holds two {{pilot and}} navigator conversion courses per year. Each six-month course includes approximately 120 {{hours in the}} FFMS and 30 hours in flying aircraft. It culminates in an airborne operation module, which includes formation flying, airdrops, night landings with night-vision goggles, and simulated combat utilising the C-130's self-defence systems to prepare the aircrew for conditions in Middle East deployments. Following this exercise, the new C-130 aircrew are posted to No.37 Squadron. No.285 Squadron may run 30 or more courses each year for ground support staff; these courses can <b>last</b> <b>from</b> one day to five weeks.|$|E
5|$|On February 21, 1975, North Vietnamese field commanders from Tri-Thien Military Zone and the 2nd Army Corps held {{a conference}} to {{establish}} their objectives, which were planned to occur in two phases; the spring-summer phase that would begin in March and probably conclude in May, and the autumn phase to <b>last</b> <b>from</b> July to August 1975. The North Vietnamese objective was {{to take control of}} Quảng Trị Province, isolate the city of Huế and if the opportunity presents itself, they would capture the entire Tri Thien-Huế area. To isolate Huế, the North Vietnamese 2nd Army Corps would move against their target from the north-west direction along Route 12 down to the south-west along Highway 14, thereby isolating the region from South Vietnamese forces in II Corps Tactical Zone.|$|E
