The sensitivity formula for critical load is analytically derived and {{expressed in terms of}} shape variation, based on the continuum formulation of the stability problem. Though the buckling problem is more efficiently solved by structural elements such as a beam and shell, elastic solids have been chosen for the buckling analysis in this paper because solid elements can generally be used for any kind of structure whether it is thick or thin. The initial stress and buckling analysis is carried out by the commercial analysis code ANSYS. Sensitivity is then computed by using the mathematical package MATLAB with the results of ANSYS.

40|$|Lubrication of the {{big-end bearing}} is re-examined under elastohydrodynamic assumptions. All current models {{were found to}} be in someway deficient, {{motivating}} {{the development of a new}} consistent schema. Uniform axial film-thickness assumptions and parabolic axial pressure profiles are combined with curved-beam and planar Finite Element housings to produce a single dimensional EHL model. Body-forces due to con-rod motion {{were found to be}} a necessary part of the elasticity implementation. The role of discretisation and surface displacement interpolation errors are investigated under steady load conditions. Under dynamic <b>load,</b> <b>ring,</b> housing and previous experimental works are compared. Increased dynamic journal action from housing distorsion was found to lead to film collapses not present in equivalent rigid bearing analyses; these collapses are likened to vapour cavitation. Correlation of dynamic film-thickness measurements with the elastic solutions are generally improved over rigid predictions. With regard to minimum film thickness, inertial 'ring' solutions gave similar values to housing solutions with and without gas loading; this facilitates non-dimensionalisation. Two separate minimum-film regime were subsequently identified: one in the con-rod neck and a second, at higher load, in the cap. The first condition sees thicker minimum films than the rigid bearing; the second, thinner films with an increased sensitivity to load. Non-dimensionalisation of this transition along with bearing flexibility and load enabled new tribological measures to be developed; the influence of elastic geometry on minimum film thickness is sufficiently well portrayed to make these useful design tools...|$|E

40|$|Long run-out {{landslides}} {{have often}} caused catastrophic disasters throught the world. These landslides have low apparent friction angles during motion {{in comparison with}} the usual values of internal friction angle of soils and rocks. Using the ring shear apparatus, this paper experimentally investigated the behavior and the mechanism of shear resistance mobilized during rapid loading on soil layers, which is very likely to occur in long run-out landslides. After residual state was obtained by constant speed shearing at a low normal stress in dry soils, normal stress was rapidly increased while shearing speed was maintained. In some cases, the stress deviated from the failure line, and the shear state was changed from the plastic failure state to the pre-failure deformation state even though shear deformation was continued. It was found out that the ratio of the shear speed to the loading speed should be greater than a critical value for the plastic failure state to be maintained throughout rapid <b>loading.</b> The <b>ring</b> shear apparatus was improved so that the undrained loading tests could be implemented and the generated pore pressure could also be measured.

40|$|Abstract: In the past, {{the static}} load−displacement curve was {{sufficient}} to predict the deformation of plastics. As plastics have increasingly been used in more applications such as automotive pasts, the dynamic material properties considering the strain rate and temperature become important. In plastics, the stress is typically very sensitive to the strain rate, but results for dynamic material properties at the intermediate strain rate ranged from 1 /sec to 500 /sec do not have been published sufficiently. This paper introduces a newly developed high speed material testing apparatus for tensile tests at the strain rate up to 500 /sec and dynamic material properties of plastics from experiments. Stress−strain curves were acquired for the polycarbonate and the polypropylene from the dynamic tensile test and utilized to obtain {{the relationship of the}} stress and the fracture elongation to the strain rate.

The FGM shell is developed in accordance to the volume fraction law from two constituents, namely stainless steel and nickel.

The FGM properties are graded along the thickness direction of the shell. The supported FGM thick shell equations with one <b>ring</b> and pressure <b>loading</b> are established based on first-order shear deformation theory. The governing equations of motion were employed, using energy function and by applying the Ritz method. The boundary conditions represented by the end conditions of the FGM thick shell are simply supported-simply supported, clamped-clamped, free-free, clamped-free, clamped-simply supported, free-simply supported, sliding-free and sliding-clamped.

40|$|The {{functional}} relationship between vascular smooth muscle α 1 - and α 2 -adrenoceptor (AR) subtypes was investigated by simultaneous measurement of contractile and fluorescence ratio in fura- 2 <b>loaded</b> <b>rings</b> of dog saphenous vein (DSV). Prazosin, {{as well as}} rauwolscine, at 0. 1 μM, substantially antagonized contractions and associated cytosolic [Ca 2 +] rises induced by UK 14304, while rauwolscine, as well as prazosin, antagonized similar effects of phenylephrine (PE). These antagonisms were characterized by a parallel rightward shift of the concentration-response curves. In the absence of extracellular Ca 2 +, PE as well as UK 14304 caused simultaneous transient elevation of contractile force and cytosolic [Ca 2 +], although the UK 14304 responses were smaller than PE responses. We propose that DSV smooth muscle cells possess interacting α 1 - and α 2 -ARs which have overlapping functional domain sensitive to the agonists and antagonists of either α-AR subtype. Both α-AR subtypes appear to utilize similar signaling mechanisms via Ca 2 + release from the same intracellular stores and Ca 2 + entry across the plasma membrane...|$|R

To this end, prompted by the hypothesis of "sliding-surface liquefaction" advocated by Sassa [Development of a new cyclic <b>loading</b> <b>ring</b> shear apparatus to study earthquake-induced-landslides. Report for grant-in-aid for development of scientific research by the Ministry on Education, Science and Culture, Japan (project no. 03556021), 1994, p. 1 - 106; Keynote lecture: access to the dynamics of landslides during earthquakes by a new cyclic <b>loading</b> high-speed <b>ring</b> shear apparatus. In: Proceedings of the sixth international symposium on landslides, 1992. In: Landslides, vol. 3. Balkema: Rotterdam; 1995. p. 1919 - 39], a dynamic analysis of the early stages of an earth slide is presented considering two mechanically coupled sub-structures: (a) the rapidly deforming shear band {{at the base of the}} slide and (b) the accelerating sliding mass modeled as a rigid body. The proposed model for sliding is based on: (i) the concept of high pore-water pressure generation by grain crushing along the sliding surface (proposed by Sassa et al. in 1995), (ii) an experimental model developed by Hardin [Crushing of soil particles. J Geotech Eng 1985; 111 (10) : 1177 - 92] for crushing of soil particles under compression and shear, expressed with a set of developed equations governing the mechanism of breakage, and (iii) the hysteretic stress-strain Bouc-Wen-type constitutive model coupled with the Coulomb friction law. An attempt is made to adjust the model parameters to Sassa's experimental data in ring-shear tests. The method leads to a reasonable prediction of the large displacement of the Nikawa landslide. A sensitivity analysis is also carried out for the influence of key model parameters (e. g. shape, crushing hardness, void ratio, grain size distribution, effective normal stress) on the pore-pressure rise due to particle breakage.

The interface of ring plate and halfspace has been considered as smooth. The present approach automatically takes care of the semi-infinite nature of the transversely isotropic medium unlike the total finite element procedure where the halfspace is represented by a large size solid (discretised in to a large number of finite elements, especially in treating a multilayered halfspace) with certain imposed constraints.
