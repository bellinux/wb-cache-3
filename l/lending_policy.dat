500|$|Credit Suisse's founder, Alfred Escher, was called, [...] "the spiritual {{father of}} the railway law of 1852," [...] for his work {{defeating}} {{the idea of a}} state-run railway system in Switzerland in favor of privatization. Escher founded Credit Suisse (originally called the Swiss Credit Institution, i.e., Schweizerische Kreditanstalt) jointly with jointly with Allgemeine Deutsche Credit-Anstalt in 1856 primarily to provide domestic funding to railway projects, avoiding French banks that wanted to exert influence over the railway system. Escher aimed to start the company with three million shares and instead sold 218 million shares in three days. The bank was modeled after Crédit Mobilier, a bank funding railway projects in France that was founded two years prior, except Credit Suisse had a more conservative <b>lending</b> <b>policy</b> focused on short-to-medium term loans. In its first year of operation, 25 percent of the bank's revenues was from the Swiss Northeastern Railway, which was being built by Escher's company, Nordostbahn.|$|E

40|$|This study uses a {{structural}} equation approach {{to assess the}} presence of a credit supply effect in the commercial mortgage market and the lenders' ability to incorporate expectations about this effect into their <b>lending</b> <b>policies.</b> A credit supply effect is defined as the effect of mortgage supply on the level of loan defaults. The empirical analysis shows two important results. First, changes in loan defaults appear to be followed by changes in commercial mortgage supply with a lag of approximately four to five years. Second, lenders tend to behave myopically, failing to incorporate expectations about the credit supply effect into their <b>lending</b> <b>policies.</b> Additionally, a simulation suggests that adequate timing of the mortgage supply cycle is crucial in limiting the incidence of mortgage default. ...|$|R

Westpac, although suffering similar situations with defaulting loans, agreed to support AGC through the provision of substantial funding lines.

5000|$|After the war, foreign {{currency}} {{was in such}} short supply {{that a variety of}} restrictions were imposed on trade and commerce. In an attempt to cope with the difficult economic situation, the currency was devalued, but correcting the persistent current account deficit proved difficult. A severe housing shortage prompted the introduction of state funding for housing mortgages implemented through Landsbanki’s mortgage division to help rectify the situation. [...] Concerned about sluggish economic growth, the government sought ways to support industry - recognising that fisheries was the key sector - and a Fisheries Credit Department was established under Landsbanki’s auspices. As a result of its open-handed <b>lending</b> <b>policy</b> to the fishing industry, borrowing by this sector doubled in the following decades, rising from 23% of total loans outstanding in 1941 to 46% in 1960. The development was reflected in the major surge in the contribution of fisheries to GDP.|$|E
50|$|Application {{score is}} also used {{as a factor in}} {{deciding}} such things as an overdraft or credit card limit. Lenders are generally happier to extend a larger limit to higher scoring customers than to lower scoring customers, because {{they are more likely to}} pay borrowings back.Alongside scorecards lie policy rules which apply regulatory requirements (such as making sure there is no lending to under 18s) and other <b>lending</b> <b>policy</b> (such as many lenders will not lend to customers who have a CCJ registered against them).Credit Strategy is also concerned with the ongoing management of a customer's account, especially with revolving credit products such as credit cards, overdrafts and flexible loans, where the customer's balance can go up as well as down. Behavioural scorecards are used (usually monthly) to provide an updated picture of the credit-quality of the customer/account. As the customer's profile changes, the lender may choose to extend or contract the customer's limits.|$|E
50|$|The Royal Bank of Queensland, {{established}} in 1885 by local investors who were finding {{it hard to}} obtain loans from sources outside Queensland, was intended {{as an alternative to}} its rival the Queensland National Bank. It was one of only three Queensland-based banks established during the 19th century. The head office opened in Brisbane in February 1886 and although it established three branches in the mining towns of Gympie, Charters Towers and Croydon, it generally avoided mining towns because they were too risky. Instead the Royal Bank concentrated on mercantile and agricultural interests near the coast, opening branches in sound agricultural districts and ports. By 1889 it had 20 branches and agencies including branches in London and Edinburgh. In 1890 the Royal Bank occupied fifth place amongst the ten banks trading in Queensland. The Royal Bank, in contrast to the Queensland National Bank, generally contented itself with timber and iron premises rather than occupying extravagant masonry buildings in the larger towns; established a more cautious <b>lending</b> <b>policy</b> instead of erratic lending due to fluctuating government deposits; and was the bank of humbler men rather than of the elite.|$|E
