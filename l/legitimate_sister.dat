50|$|It was {{supposedly}} written in 1889 or early 1890 during Nietzsche's {{stay in a}} mental asylum in the Thuringian city of Jena. If <b>legitimate,</b> My <b>Sister</b> and I would be Nietzsche's second autobiographical and final overall work, chronologically following his Wahnbriefe (Madness Letters), written during his extended time of mental collapse. My Sister and I makes several bold and otherwise unreported biographical claims, most notably of an incestuous relationship between Nietzsche and his sister Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche, {{as well as an}} affair with Richard Wagner's wife Cosima. It is written in a style that combines anecdote and aphorism {{in a manner similar to}} other Nietzsche works.|$|R
50|$|Back in Portugal, {{despite his}} father's efforts {{and his own}} illustrious {{military}} record, Duarte de Menezes was only able to inherit his family title of Count of Viana do Alentejo. The crown-granted titles of Count of Vila Real, alferes-mor of the kingdom and governor of Ceuta went to Duarte's <b>legitimate</b> <b>sister</b> Brites de Menezes and her consort Fernando de Noronha. Duarte de Menezes left Ceuta shortly after, passing the garrison over to Fernando de Noronha, and returned to Portugal by July 1438. King Edward of Portugal quickly regretted his decision, and personally apologized to Duarte for failing to appoint him to Ceuta {{and tried to make}} up for it by appointing him alcaide of Beja and other benefices.|$|E
5000|$|In 1795, the Lolotte Forssberg affair occurred, {{which caused}} {{considerable}} attention. Lolotte Forssberg was the chamber maid and foster sibling of Sophia Albertina. In 1795, an anonymous letter {{was found by}} Sophia Albertina, which pointed out Lolotte Forssberg as her secret sister. Sophia Albertina issued an investigation, and believed herself to have reasons to believe that Forssberg was indeed her sister, and therefore decided {{to take responsibility for}} her welfare and treat her officially as a sister. She believed for a time that Forssberg was her <b>legitimate</b> <b>sister,</b> whose births her parents had reasons to hide, and therefore demanded that Lolotte Forssberg should be officially recognised. [...] This caused a scandal, not only in Sweden, but also in Germany, where her maternal relatives, the Prussian royal family, expressed their disapproval of what they perceived as a deception of which she had been a victim. It is likely, that Lolotte Forssberg was in fact her sister, but her illegitimate half sister by her father and a lady-in waiting, Ulla von Liewen. In 1799, Sophia Albertina herself stated that Lolotte Forssberg was her illegitimate halfsister, and arranged a marriage with her courtier, Count Magus Stenbock, and had her presented at court. Gossip would later suggest, that Lolotte Forssberg was the illegitimate child of Sophia Albertina herself, but as Forssberg was born in 1766, she was evidently not the same woman as the alleged secret daughter of Sophia Albertina and Frederick Hessenstein, who had been born in 1785. Lolotte Forssberg was to remain with Sophia Albertina her entire life, and was named as her heir in her will.|$|E
50|$|Maike Vogt-Lüerssen {{argues that}} the famous {{painting}} actually depicts Bia's younger, <b>legitimate</b> half <b>sister,</b> Maria de' Medici. Vogt-Lüerssen noted {{in an article in}} Medicea - Rivista interdisciplinare di studi medicei that the subject of the portrait was identified as Maria until the 1950s and the pearls depicted in the portrait were a common symbol of the Medicis, often worn by legitimate female members of the house. Vogt-Lüerssen believes that the child depicted in a famous portrait by Pontormo with Maria Salviati is actually Bia, her eldest granddaughter, because group portraits in that era depicted family members with close blood relationships and Salviati's two younger granddaughters, Maria and Isabella, were too young at Salviati's death to be the 5- or 6-year-old girl in the portrait.|$|R

40|$|There is {{compelling}} evidence that atherosclerosis {{has its roots}} in early life when the disturbances of the lipids and lipoproteins have a largely relevant role as a risk factor. In Portugal, the scarceness of research concerning the lipid profile in the neonatal period and the occurrence of controversial aspects in this field were determinant of the present study. The cord blood reference values for the lipid profile of the newborn (n#ident to# 188) were obtained: total cholesterol (TC) : 70, 70 mg/dl #+-# 22, 34 : HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) : 26, 77 mg/dl_ 7, 49; triglyceride (TG) : 52, 96 mg/dl_ 33, 26. No gender, race and type of delivery differences were present for any of the studied parameters. TC level was as raised as the gestational age was lower (full-term v. s. preterm neonates: p< 0. 05). The simultaneous occurrence of prenatal risk factors and neonatal depression contributed significantly for raised TG (p#ident to# 0, 0001). So, hypertriglyceridemia seems to be a good index of perinatal asphyxia. In 188 newborns, 10 cases were found to have dyslipoproteinemia distributed as follows: a) four cases of dyslipoproteinemia associated to perinatal risk factors - type IV pattern according to the classification of Frederickson (hypertriglyceridemia) in three neonates and type II-b pattern (hypertriglyceridemia+hypercholesterolemia) in one infant of diabetic mother; b) six cases of type IV dyslipoproteinemia associated to similar intra-familial cases and familial history of cardiovascular disturbances, respectively in five and two cases. Follow-up of the ten above mentioned infants with evidence of dyslipoproteinemia in the neonatal period was carried out; lipid profile was reassessed 3 - 5 months and 3 - 5 years apart. By 3 - 5 months of age, (first re-evaluation) the lipid profile was found to be normal in four cases related to perinatal risk factors; the remaining six cases were found to have the lipid profile similar to the one obtained in the neonatal period. The six cases of persisting dyslipoproteinemia during infancy have been reinvestigated between the 3 rd and 5 th years of age and, interestingly, the respective lipid profile was found to be normal. In this study, the occurrence of dyslipoproteinemia persisting during infancy and of similar lipid profile in children's family pedigrees (progenitors and/or brothers or <b>sisters)</b> <b>legitimate</b> the hypothesis of autosomal dominant inheritance. Not being perfectly cleared the mechanism by which the hypertriglyceridemias genetically marked from the conception have phenotipic expression only in the adult age, we speculate about their possible manifestation during infancy with transitional or variable pattern. In order to establish the true significance of these transient dyslipoproteinemias detected during infancy related to familial cases, it is mandatory to give continuity to the follow-up clinical-biological study of the children until the adult ageAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.
