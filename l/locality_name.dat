500|$|The {{manuscript}} of Serat Rerenggan mentions {{the story of}} Demang Tegis, a Portuguese man said {{to be one of}} the architect of Taman Sari. According to the manuscript, a strange man suddenly appeared in Mancingan Village (a <b>locality</b> <b>name</b> on the south coast of Java near Parangtritis). With long nose, white complexion, and a foreign language, the villagers suspected that the person was some kind of spirit or forest fairy. They presented him to the current sultan, Hamengkubuwono II. Apparently the sultan found interest in the person and took the strange man as his servant. Some years had passed and the man had finally learned to talk in Javanese. According to him, he was a Portuguese (or in Javanese, Portegis) who was stranded from a shipwreck. He also claimed to have been a housebuilder, so the sultan ordered him to erect a fortress. Satisfied by the man’s work, the sultan gave him the title [...] "demang." [...] From then on that person was known as Demang Portegis or Demang Tegis.|$|E
