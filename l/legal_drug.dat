This evidence was only made public after both enquiries were completed.|$|E
500|$|Media organisations {{including}} the BBC and The Guardian incorrectly reported mephedrone was commonly {{used as a}} plant fertiliser. In fact sellers of the drug described it as [...] "plant food" [...] because it was illegal to sell the compound for human consumption. In late 2009 UK newspapers began referring to the drug as meow or miaow (sometimes doubled as meow meow or miaow miaow), a name that was almost unknown on {{the street at the}} time. In November 2009, the tabloid newspaper, The Sun published a story stating that a man had ripped off his own scrotum whilst using mephedrone. The story was later shown to be an online joke posted on mephedrone.com, later included in a police report with the caveat that it could be unreliable. The police report was used as a source for the story in The Sun. Other myths the media often repeated during 2010 were that mephedrone had led to the deaths of over 20 people, teachers were unable to confiscate the drug from pupils and the government was too slow to ban the drug. Parallels were drawn between the media coverage of mephedrone and a piece of satire by Chris Morris in 1997 on Brass Eye when he tricked public figures into talking of the dangers of taking the fictional <b>legal</b> <b>drug</b> [...] "cake". The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) have suggested that the media coverage of the drug led to its increased usage. Jon Silverman, a former BBC Home Affairs Correspondent, has written two articles discussing how the media had a strong influence over the UK government's drugs policy, particularly in that the government wished to demonstrate they were being [...] "tough" [...] on drugs.|$|E

40|$|In this degree I {{deal with}} the {{comparison}} of view-points regarding illegal and <b>legal</b> <b>drugs</b> among pupils in 9 th grade. In this research I will focus on tobacco, marihuana, heroin and pills which effect mentality. The empirical part of the thesis in based on these differences. In theoretical part I'm defining the definition of view-points, their characteristics and functions, and I also focus on the source of unfounded view-points. Then I focus on protective and risk factors for using drugs and then on drugs and their classification. Very important for my research is also the chapter of the drugs and sex, so how does the sex category influences the view-points of illegal and <b>legal</b> <b>drugs.</b> In the conclusion I look at the influence of parent’s education on these factors. Empirical part involves sixty pupils in 9 th grade of the Simon Jenko Kranj Primary School in the age from 13 to 15. The {{research has shown that}} the general opinion about the <b>legal</b> <b>drugs</b> is about being less harmful, addictive and stigmatizing than illegal drugs. Furthermore, parent’s influence is regarding the negative standpoints toward <b>legal</b> <b>drugs</b> and the sex has no influence on view-points toward <b>legal</b> <b>drugs</b> but it has regarding illegal drugs. And for the end I can conclude that the education of parents has an influence on their children developing positive or negative view-points regarding legal but not also illegal drugs and that the place of residence does not influences the frequency of adolescents using drugs...|$|R

Hence although the need to legalize all drugs in order to alleviate the present problems caused by their criminalization is easy enough to demonstrate, to find a model of <b>legal</b> distribution of <b>drugs</b> that avoids the negative consequences of the present policies regarding <b>legal</b> <b>drugs</b> is much more difficult.

40|$|<b>Legal</b> <b>drugs</b> {{and their}} use by {{students}} at secondary schools in the Tábor district Drugs currently represent a major problem worldwide, affecting each of us. The Czech Republic ranks among the countries with the increasing trend of excessive alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption in this society is considered an absolutely normal and tolerated phenomenon, equally as smoking of tobacco products and excessive use of non-prescription drugs. Alcohol and drugs are not only legal but their consumption is offered practically wherever you go. The period of adolescence involves experimenting as its natural part. <b>Legal</b> <b>drugs</b> are the first things the adolescents experiment with {{and for this reason}} my bachelor thesis focuses on the use of alcohol, tobacco, caffeine and medicinal drugs. The theoretical part of the thesis summarizes facts about the individual <b>legal</b> <b>drugs</b> (alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, medicinal drugs) and analyzes related issues. The purpose of my bachelor thesis was to find out facts about the use of <b>legal</b> <b>drugs</b> at secondary schools in the district of Tábor and I have used some partial goals and previously established hypotheses to achieve it. The partial goals included identification of the first experience with <b>legal</b> <b>drugs</b> and quantities consumed by secondary school students. In order to verify the established hypotheses I have used quantitative research and the method of interviewing by questionnaires. The research group consisted of 290 respondents, from which 108 boys and 101 girls. 7 hypotheses were formulated for the research. The hypothesis H 1 assumed that boys consume alcohol more often than girls. The hypothesis H 2 assumed that boys consume tobacco more often than girls. The hypothesis H 3 assumed that boys have the first experience with alcohol earlier than girls. The hypothesis H 4 assumed that boys have the first experience with tobacco earlier than girls. The hypothesis H 5 assumed girls consume more caffeine than boys. The hypothesis H 6 assumed that girls consume more medical drugs than boys. The hypothesis H 7 assumed that students of secondary vocational schools consume more alcohol than students of secondary comprehensive schools. All those previously established hypotheses have been confirmed. This bachelor thesis may be used by the general public and by professionals in the Czech Republic to increase the level of awareness about the use of <b>legal</b> <b>drugs.</b> The thesis has brought some new findings and it has mapped the situation in consumption of <b>legal</b> <b>drugs</b> by students of secondary schools in the district of Tábor. Therefore the thesis may contribute to an effective prevention among this group of adolescent youth...|$|R
