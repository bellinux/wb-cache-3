40|$|Extract] At one time, all {{individuals}} {{over the age}} of 65 were considered old. In the 2011 Australian census 3. 1 million people were aged 65 years and over (ABS 2013 a). With advancements in disease control, living conditions and health technology, people are living longer. As noted in Chapter 6, the life expectancy for non-Indigenous Australian males is 78. 7 years and for females is 82. 6 years; in contrast, the life expectancy for Indigenous males is 67. 2 years and for females is 72. 9 years (ABS 2011). This equates to, on average, 10. 6 years <b>less</b> <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> for Indigenous Australians (ABS 2011). People aged 85 years and over are the fastest growing of all age groups in the country, with the number of people aged 85 and over having increased by 170 % in the past two decades, compared with a total population growth of 31 % in the same period (ABS 2010).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Proper {{treatment}} of lymph node-negative breast cancer depends on an accurate prognosis. To improve prognostic models for this disease, we evaluated whether an immunohistochemical marker for proliferating cells, Ki-S 2 (a monoclonal antibody that binds to a 100 -kd nuclear protein expressed in S, G 2, and M {{phases of the}} cell cycle), is an accurate indicator of prognosis. METHODS: We studied 371 Swedish women with lymph node-negative breast cancer; the median follow-up time was 95 months. The fraction of tumor cells in S phase was assessed by flow cytometry, and tumor cell proliferation was measured immunohistochemically with the monoclonal antibodies Ki-S 2 and Ki-S 5 (directed against the nuclear antigen Ki- 67). A combined prognostic index was calculated {{on the basis of}} the S-phase fraction, progesterone receptor content, and tumor size. RESULTS: In multivariate analyses that did or did not (263 and 332 observations, respectively) include the S-phase fraction and the combined prognostic index, the Ki-S 2 labeling index (percentage of antibody-stained tumor cell nuclei) emerged as the most statistically significant predictor of overall survival, disease-specific survival, and disease-free survival (all two-sided P<. 0001). In the risk group defined by a Ki-S 2 labeling index of 10 % or <b>less,</b> <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> was not statistically significantly different from that of age-matched women without breast cancer, whereas the group with a high Ki-S 2 labeling index had an increased risk of mortality of up to 20 -fold. CONCLUSIONS: Cellular proliferation is a major determinant of the biologic behavior of breast cancer. Prognosis is apparently best indicated by the percentage of cells in S through M phases of the cell cycle. Measurement of the Ki-S 2 labeling index of a tumor sample may improve a clinician's ability to make an accurate prognosis and to identify patients with a low risk of recurrence who may not need adjuvant therapy...|$|E

Little is known about the relative weight the community places on various allocation criteria. This study aims to determine community preferences for organ allocation. Methods: Community respondents recruited from a web-based panel chose which patient received a transplant in 30 scenarios presenting two hypothetical patients. Patients were described in age, sex, previous transplants, whether they or family were registered donors, had caring responsibilities, adherence, time on waiting list, estimated survival and quality of life (QOL) with and without transplant, comorbidities, and lifestyle factors, such as smoking. Analyses were conducted in NLOGIT 5. 0, using a mixed-logit model. Results: Two thousand fifty-one respondents aged 18 to 83 years completed the survey. All attributes significantly influenced recipient choice except sex and having diabetes. Younger patients were preferred over older patients. Family member donor registration, having caring responsibilities, and longer time on waiting list increased priority. Pretransplant <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> was valued more highly than posttransplant life expectancy; 1 year <b>less</b> of pretransplant <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> required an increase of 1. 49 years in posttransplant <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> to compensate.

Conclusion: Lower pretransplant <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> (need) was more important than higher posttransplant <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> (utility). Although current allocation algorithms are consistent with community preferences for prioritizing children and time on the waiting list, favoring patients with high predicted posttransplant survival as potential recipients may not be aligned with community preferences...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} health expectancy calculations from Bulgaria for 1976 - 1992. The calculations {{are based on}} mortality statistics and data from a national information system from the Expert Medical Commissions on Working Capacity about loss of working capacity. Following internationally accepted terminology, the most appropriate term for the health expectancies presented here is 'occupational handicap-free life expectancy' (OHFLE). <b>Life</b> <b>expectancies</b> were calculated as partial <b>life</b> <b>expectancies</b> from ages 16 to 59. Health expectancy calculations followed Sullivan's cross-sectional method with age and sex specific prevalence data on occupational handicap. Around 1985 a three- to four-fold increase in these prevalences occurred. The distribution of occupational handicaps over sexes, age groups and severity levels, however, remained fairly constant. The results show a decrease both in partial <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> within the age range 16 - 59 and in OHFLE {{at the age of}} 16 for men. For women a more or <b>less</b> stable partial <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> and a decrease in OHFLE at the age of 16 was found around 1985. The introduction of more incentives for people who successfully registered probably caused the decrease around 1985. Major social changes may have acted as confounding factors for the fluctuations after 1985. On the other hand the findings may reflect real changes in population health due to an increasing incidence in some major disease categories. The nation-wide system for assessment and registration of health related working incapacity has proved a useful source for an attempt to calculate OHFLE. Given uncertainties about the population health underlying these changes in OHFLE, however, it is recommended that health interview and health examination surveys should be considered as alternative routes for achieving a more comprehensive picture of population health in Bulgaria. health expectancy occupational handicap working incapacity expert medical commissions Bulgaria...|$|R

The life tables by level of education cover the years 1986 - 1990. Indicators of disability and poor health were based on three variables from the nationwide 1986 Survey on Living Conditions (N = 12, 057) : limiting long-standing illness, functional disability and poor self-perceived health. Two cutting points indicating different levels of severity of disability or poor health were used for each measure, giving six dichotomous indicators.

Disparities persisted over time. In 1990 – 1992, <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> was 4. 7 years shorter in high unemployment than in low unemployment areas. In 2006 – 2010, the <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> difference between the lowest and highest unemployment areas decreased to 3. 8 years. Heart disease, cancer, homicide, unintentional injuries, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, and liver cirrhosis contributed most to the lower <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> in high unemployment areas. High unemployment areas recorded larger gains in <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> than low unemployment areas, contributing to the narrowing gap during 1990 – 2010...|$|R

In this paper, we build on previous work by evaluating {{the extent to which the}} correspondence holds in actual populations. We also discuss the implications of the CAL-LCLE correspondence (or lack thereof) for using CAL as a measure of cohort <b>life</b> <b>expectancy,</b> and for understanding the connection between CAL, LCLE, and underlying period mortality conditions. cohort mortality, <b>life</b> <b>expectancy,</b> mortality measures, tempo effects...|$|R
