40|$|A {{coupling}} device is disclosed which is mechanically two fault tolerant for release. The device comprises a fastener plate and fastener body, {{each of which}} is attachable to a different one of a pair of structures to be joined. The fastener plate and body are coupled by an elongate toggle mounted at one end in a socket on the fastener plate for universal pivotal movement thereon. The other end of the toggle is received in an opening in the fastener body and adapted for limited pivotal movement therein. The toggle is adapted to be restrained by three latch hooks arranged in symmetrical equiangular spacing about the axis of the toggle, each hook being mounted on the fastener body for pivotal movement between an unlatching non-contact position with respect to the toggle and a <b>latching</b> <b>position</b> in engagement with a latching surface of the toggle. The device includes releasable lock means for locking each latch hook in its <b>latching</b> <b>position</b> whereby the toggle couples the fastener plate to the fastener body and means for releasing the lock means to unlock each said latch hook from the latch position whereby the unlocking of {{at least one of the}} latch hooks from its <b>latching</b> <b>position</b> results in the decoupling of the fastener plate from the fastener body...|$|E

40|$|Period Covered: October 2012 -July 2013 This paper {{explores the}} {{geometric}} feasibility of installing dedicated lower anchors {{in the center}} rear seating positions of vehicles. Analysis {{was based on a}} previous research study in which the lateral spacing of seat belt and LATCH lower anchorages were measured in 85 model year 2010 - 2011 vehicles. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine how many vehicles would have the physical space to incorporate a third set of dedicated lower anchors in the center seating position for child restraint installation. Usability of all of the lower anchors, as well as the seat belts, was also considered. To begin, nine vehicles that currently have dedicated lower anchors in the center position were reviewed. The distances between all seat belt anchors and lower anchors across the vehicle sample were also analyzed to identify spacings that are currently feasible in production. The arrangement of seat belt and lower anchor hardware across the rear seat was also reviewed with respect to usability. Based on these analyses, a lateral distance between the outboard webbing and outboard lower anchor of 75 to 100 mm is common. The suggested minimum distance between lower anchors and seat belt hardware is 25 mm. Based on these dimensions, vehicles with 710 mm or more between the outboard lower anchor centerlines (OBLACL) should have sufficient space to provide three sets of usable, dedicated lower anchors in the right, center, and left seating positions. Providing the highest level of usability with regard to use of seat belt or LATCH hardware in adjacent seating positions would be achieved by placing each pair of lower anchors between the webbing and buckle hardware for the seating position. If the OBLACL is less than 710 mm, an improvised center <b>LATCH</b> <b>position</b> (permitting use of the inboard lower anchors from the outboard seating positions to secure a child restraint in the center seating position) may be feasible. The maximum spacing of this improvised center <b>LATCH</b> <b>position</b> would be 480 mm. If a vehicle allowed an improvised center <b>LATCH</b> <b>position,</b> placing the inboard lower anchor between the outboard buckle and nearest center seat belt hardware would maximize usability of the seat belt in the outboard seating position and lower anchors in the center seating position...|$|R

40|$|A quick-connect {{fastener}} of a relatively-simple straightforward {{design is}} arranged with a tubular body adapted {{to be engaged}} against an attachment fitting in coincidental alignment with an opening in that fitting. A tubular collet having flexible finger projecting from its forward end is arranged in the fastener body to be shifted forwardly by an elongated expander member coaxially arranged within the tubular collet for advancing the collet fingers into the opening in the attachment fitting. Biasing means are arranged between the elongated expander member and a rotatable actuator which is threadedly mounted within the tubular collet {{so as to be}} rotated for urging the expander member into engagement with the collet fingers. A first coupling member is arranged on the rotatable actuator to be accessible from outside of the fastener so that a second coupling member on the distal end of a flexible shaft can be introduced into the fastener body and coupled to the first coupling member to enable a typical actuating tool coupled to the shaft outside of the fastener body to be operated for advancing the outwardly-enlarged ends of the collet fingers into the opening in the attachment fitting and thereafter rotating the actuator member to expand the fingers to that attachment fitting.

40|$|Background: Effective {{breastfeeding}} is {{a function}} of the proper positioning of mother and baby and attachment of child to the mother's breast. Positioning of the baby's body is important for good attachment and successful breastfeeding. The study was planned to assess mother–infant pair <b>latch</b> on <b>position</b> and its impact on health status of the child. Materials and Methods: It was community-based cross-sectional study conducted among 1267 children between age group of 0 – 24 months in the urban and rural field practice areas of the Department of Community Medicine, Maharishi Markandeshwar Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Mullana, Ambala, Haryana. A self-designed semi-structured questionnaire along with the WHO criteria for assessment of correct <b>latch</b> on <b>position</b> was used in this study. Results: Out of 1267 mothers, only 29. 9 % mothers initiated breastfeeding within 1 h of delivery. Mothers who had high parity had better positioning scores as compared to mothers with low parity. About 83. 7 % mothers who had parity > 2 had excellent scores as compared to those mothers having one child or two children. About 56. 8 % and 62. 7 % children who suffered from diarrhea and acute respiratory infection (ARI), respectively, had mothers with poor positioning and this difference was statistically significant (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: It was concluded that mothers who had higher parity had better positioning and attachment scores and also mothers with excellent positioning scores, their children suffered less from diarrhea and ARI.

40|$|This paper extends pin-tool {{research}} by investigating a new method to accurately position high-fidelity pins in an array, with each pin uniquely positioned under computer control. The resultant tool is a reusable prototyping {{system for the}} rapid generation of three-dimension (3 -D) profiles using CAD extracted data, with application potential {{in a variety of}} manufacturing processes. A control assessment identifies a combination of array-addressing, <b>latching</b> <b>positioning</b> hardware, and a combined "setting platen" pin-position feedback and drive as an appropriate technique for pin control. The novel platen motion strategy is capable of moving thousands of pins with a single drive motor. The system incorporates latching "locks" that operate on the "tail" of a new two-part "header and tail" pin design. Key to the lock strategy is the application of shape memory alloy actuators in a back-to-back configuration; the response of this material to electrical input is quantified and applied to achieve the unique lock design. Multiple locks combined into a demonstrator position headers to an accuracy of + 0. 09 - 0. 05 mm. The mounting pitch of the prototype system permits the use of 1. 0 mm section pins. An extension to the design ultimately allows a 15 000 pin-array to be positioned in similar to 3 min. Note to Practitioners-This research was motivated by the apparent lack of a technique to uniquely position small section pins in an array, without a bulky control system, power limitations, or motion system restrictions. Prior approaches to positioning pins in an array have used multiplexed or sequential control on pins of 6 mm section or larger. This research investigates a combined control system/hardware approach applied to pins of 1 mm square section, scalable to move thousands of pins uniquely. The presented novel solutions generate a higher fidelity surface definition than previous systems. Extending existing research on surface-smoothing interpolators that reduce the "staircase" effect generated by discrete pins would be beneficial. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{biological}} nurturing and activation of maternal and infant instincts after birth have constituted a major advance in clinical breastfeeding support. Yet, physiologic breastfeeding initiation {{is not enough}} to ensure ongoing pain-free and effective breastfeeding for many pairs. Current interventions, including “hands-off” mammalian approaches, do not improve breastfeeding outcomes, including in randomized controlled trials. Back-arching, difficulty latching or staying on the breast, and fussing at the breast are common signs of infant positional instability during breastfeeding. These cues are, however, often misdiagnosed as signs of medical conditions or oral connective tissue abnormalities, and underlying positional instability is not addressed. New clinical approaches are urgently required. This article offers a clinical approach to fit and hold (or <b>latch</b> and <b>positioning)</b> —gestalt breastfeeding, which aims to optimize positional stability and intraoral breast tissue volumes for pain-free effective breastfeeding. The word gestalt (pronounced “ger-shtolt”) means a whole that is {{more than the sum of}} its parts. Gestalt breastfeeding builds on the theoretical foundations of complexity science, physiologic breastfeeding initiation, and new understandings of the biomechanics of infant suck elucidated in ultrasound studies. It also integrates simple psychological strategies from applied functional contextualism, popularly known as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, empowering women to attend mindfully to breast sensations and their infant’s cues. Gestalt breastfeeding can be reproduced for research purposes, including in comparison studies with oral surgery, and has the potential to improve breastfeeding outcomes.

40|$|Tennessee State University is {{operating}} a 2 -m automatic telescope for high-dispersion spectroscopy. The alt-azimuth telescope is fiber-coupled to a conventional echelle spectrograph with two resolutions (R= 30, 000 and 70, 000). We control this instrument with four computers running linux and communicating over ethernet through the UDP protocol. A computer physically {{located on the}} telescope handles the acquisition and tracking of stars. We avoid the need for real-time programming in this application by periodically <b>latching</b> the <b>positions</b> of the axes in a commercial motion controller and the time in a GPS receiver. A second (spectrograph) computer sets up the spectrograph and runs its CCD, a third (roof) computer controls the roll-off roof and front flap of the telescope enclosure, and the fourth (executive) computer makes decisions about which stars to observe and when to close the observatory for bad weather.

40|$|Objective:Insufficient {{lactation}} is {{the most}} common complaint of nursing mothers in a first few months after delivery; this is known to be partly due to the mothers' deficient knowledge of proper breastfeeding. The goal {{of this study was to}} find out whether training of nursing mothers for proper lactation can enhance their lactation. Methods:During one year from May 20, 2007 to June 20, 2008 we consecutively enrolled 63 nursing mothers who had been referred to the clinic of Tabriz children's hospital for counselling and prescription of infant formula because of insufficient lactation during 30 to 60 days after parturition. At first all infants were weighed under similar controlled condition. Their weight was then compared with recorded data in their nursery discharge sheet and growth surveillance card. Term infants with weight gain of less than 500 g/month were consecutively enrolled in the study. All mothers passed a short training course on nutritional and immunological benefits of mother milk for growth of their baby as well as <b>latch</b> and <b>positioning</b> techniques of breast feeding. After 15 days we weighed the infants again and compared the two recorded weights to assess the sufficiency of breastfeeding and effect of training. Statistical analysis was done with independent sample test and paired t- test using SPSS software. Findings: In 63 breastfed infants with an age of 30 to 60 days, before training course of mothers, minimum, maximum and mean weight gain was 8. 3, 16 and 12. 5 (� 3. 8) g/day respectively; 15 days after training of mothers these figures were 7. 6, 34. 6 and 21. 1 (� 13. 5) g/day respectively. Results showed that weight gain in 54 (85. 7 %) infants was satisfactory which was statistically meaningful (P< 0. 001).

40|$|A {{significant}} improvement in memory fault tolerance, beyond what is already provided {{by the use of}} an appropriate error-correcting code (ECC), can be achieved by electronic chip swapping, without any compromise of data integrity as large numbers of faults are allowed to accumulate. Since most large and medium-sized semiconductor memories are organized so that each bit position of the system word (ECC codeword) is fed from a dzrerent chip, and quite often from a dzfferent array card, or at least from distinct partitions of an array card, the various bit positions have separate address circuitry on the array cards. This fact is important, and can be exploited to provide effective address permutation capability, which allows the realignment of faults which would otherwise have caused an uncorrectable multiple error in an ECC codeword. When faults occur in a codeword to produce an uncorrectable error (UE), the addressing within one of the error bit position array cards can be altered using simple EX-OR circuitry and storage latches. The content of the latches is computed using a fault map of the memory together with an algorithm. These techniques are referred to as Fault Alignment Exclusion (FAE) using address permutation. Practical considerations as to the complexity of the fault map, the number of storage <b>latches</b> per bit <b>position,</b> and the overall effectiveness of the permutation to disperse the expected numbers of errors are presented in this paper. 1.

Termed the Microshutter (u-shutter) Array, the device {{will be used to}} control the transmission of light, with both high efficiency and contrast, to a multi-object spectrometer on the James Webb Space Telescope. Fabrication of the p-shutter array employs several novel designs and processing techniques. The current generation of micro-shutters consists of 128 x 64 pixel arrays with unit cell dimensions of 100 x 200 microns. Shutters are patterned in silicon nitride and sit on a 100 micron silicon frame that is DRIE etched below each shutter. The front and back sides of the device are shown. A magnetic cobalt-iron alloy patterned on top of the shutter allows it to be actuated 90 degrees out-of-plane, into the frame, by an external magnetic field. An electrode on the shutter and a vertical electrode on the sidewall of the frame, approximately 90 pm deep, allow them to be electrostatically latched in their rotated position. The vertical electrode is deposited and patterned on the backside of the frame in a single step using a directionally controlled evaporation. Individual addressing of shutters for electrostatic latching is accomplished via a crosspoint addressing scheme, with no on-chip active components. A portion of an array with shutters in the open, <b>latched,</b> and closed <b>positions</b> is shown. Light loss at shutter edges is minimized by an overhanging aluminum light-shield that is anchored to the frame. A photoresist sacrificial layer is used to raise the light-shield up and over the 2 micron gap that surrounds each pixel. After completion, arrays are subjected to life cycle, environmental and optical testing. Fabricated devices have survived 10 (exp 6) actuation cycles at both room and cryogenic temperatures and a 14 g rms launch-simulation test.
