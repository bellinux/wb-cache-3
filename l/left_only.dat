5|$|Despite precautions, the {{post-production}} faced significant delays {{owing to}} the digital inter-mediation, increased work-load due to the 3-D and dubbed versions of the film, and delays in {{the completion of the}} visual effects. The post-production also faced budget constraints and witnessed an overuse of CGI according to the cinematographer. The delays <b>left</b> <b>only</b> two days for printing the film and sending it to theatres, generating significant anxiety over a possible delay in the release. Khan subsequently kept strict tabs on the progress of work, and postponed his knee surgery to complete the film on time.|$|E
5|$|In November 1276, war was declared. Initial {{operations}} were launched under the captaincy of Mortimer, Lancaster (Edward's brother Edmund) and William de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick. Support for Llywelyn was weak among his own countrymen. In July 1277 Edward invaded {{with a force}} of 15,500, of whom 9,000 were Welshmen. The campaign never came to a major battle, and Llywelyn soon realised {{he had no choice}} but to surrender. By the Treaty of Aberconwy in November 1277, he was <b>left</b> <b>only</b> with the land of Gwynedd, though he was allowed to retain the title of Prince of Wales.|$|E

In 1990 Zubir's life and passion as a {{musician}} were documented in a book titled Zubir Said: His Songs, and in 2004 a S$20,000 bronze bust of a bespectacled Zubir was installed in Gallery 6 of the Malay Heritage Centre which pays tribute to icons in Malay arts and culture.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the inquiry}} opened, a poll was {{conducted}} in Tunstall where ratepayers of the town showed themselves to be in favour of federation. As the council itself had voted against federation, it decided not to oppose or support federation but instead to achieve the best deal it could for the town. The three-day inquiry opened on 8 January 1908 and was chaired by Major Norton, {{an officer of the}} Local Government Board. Norton's appointment itself caused controversy with the delegation from Burslem walking out on the first day protesting that Norton had already declared himself in favour of federation. The walkout did not disrupt the hearing but <b>left</b> <b>only</b> Fenton and Staffordshire County Council opposed to the plan, with Tunstall neutral and Hanley, Stoke and Longton in favour. The bulk of the inquiry examined rating schemes based largely on the Owen or Geen proposals from the previous federation attempt.|$|E

5|$|Bradford were {{expected}} to struggle in their first season in the top flight for 77 years. Jewell signed David Wetherall, Dean Saunders and Neil Redfearn, all experienced top flight performers, but City were in the bottom four teams {{for most of the}} season. It was Bradford's home form – they earned 26 of their 36 points at Valley Parade – that was key to City avoiding relegation, which was narrowly averted by two points after a shock 1–0 final day victory over Liverpool in 1999–2000, sending Wimbledon down instead. When Jewell <b>left</b> <b>only</b> days after the season ended, McCall was appointed assistant manager to Chris Hutchings, and subsequently served as caretaker manager for two games when Hutchings was sacked after just 12 games of the 2000–01 league season. City were relegated with just 26 points. During a 6–1 defeat to West Yorkshire rivals Leeds United in the penultimate game, McCall and team-mate Andy Myers fought on the pitch.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the small}} range of the bluebuck {{at the time of}} European {{settlement}} of the Cape region in the 17th and 18th centuries compared to the much wider area evidenced by fossil remains, it is thought the species was already in decline before this time. The bluebuck was the sole species of Hippotragus in the region until 70,00035,000 years ago, but the roan antelope appears to have become predominant about 11,000 years ago. This might have coincided with grasslands being replaced by, for example, brush and forest, thereby reducing what is presumed to be the preferred habitat of the bluebuck, the grasslands. The results of the sea level changes in the early Holocene may also {{have played a role in}} the decline of the species, and <b>left</b> <b>only</b> the southern population to survive into historical times.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} Beatles' {{trip to the}} United States, merchandisers pitched many {{products}} to Epstein, including Beatles clocks, pens, cigarette lighters, plastic wigs, bracelets, games, etc., but he rejected them all. This was because he had already allowed David Jacobs, the lawyer for NEMS, to give away 90 per cent of merchandising rights to one Nicky Byrne, in the UK. This was later deemed to be a disastrous mistake, as it <b>left</b> <b>only</b> 10 per cent for Epstein, NEMS and the Beatles. Byrne then took over Epstein's Stramsact merchandising in the UK and set up Seltaeb (Beatles spelled backwards), in the United States. While the Beatles were ensconced in the Plaza Hotel in New York, Epstein was further besieged by calls and visits from promoters, retailers, television commentators and hustlers.|$|E

5|$|It is {{the largest}} of the Small Isles, and the 15th largest Scottish island, but is {{inhabited}} by only about thirty or so people, all of whom live in the village of Kinloch on the east coast. The island has been inhabited since the 8th millennium BC and provides some of the earliest known evidence of human occupation in Scotland. The early Celtic and Norse settlers <b>left</b> <b>only</b> a few written accounts and artefacts. From the 12th to 13th centuries on, the island was held by various clans including the MacLeans of Coll. The population grew to over 400 by the late 18th century but was cleared of its indigenous population between 1826 and 1828. The island then became a sporting estate, the exotic Kinloch Castle being constructed by the Bulloughs in 1900. Rùm was purchased by the Nature Conservancy Council in 1957.|$|E
5|$|Monica (Courteney Cox) {{tells her}} friends {{that she will}} not be cooking a turkey for Thanksgiving because of the large amount of {{leftovers}} it will create. Chandler does not eat turkey {{as a result of his}} dislike of all Thanksgiving foods (a result of childhood trauma), Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow's character) is a vegetarian and Rachel was having an aversion to poultry from her pregnancy. This <b>left</b> <b>only</b> Monica, Ross and Joey to eat the enormous turkey. Joey (Matt LeBlanc) protests, and announces that he will eat the entire turkey himself if necessary. Monica agrees, and Joey finishes the nineteen-pound turkey by the end of the episode. Monica tells Rachel that she has invited over an old high-school friend of hers and Ross's called Will Colbert (Brad Pitt). Rachel does not remember him, and he reacts with total disgust when he finds out Rachel will be joining them for dinner.|$|E
5|$|Mortier {{accepted}} the bait of a rumored Russian retreat. In {{the early morning}} of 11 November he and Gazan departed from Dürenstein to seize Stein and Krems, presuming the Russians had either abandoned the settlements or <b>left</b> <b>only</b> a small rear-guard behind. As they approached Stein, a column of Miloradovich's troops attacked the French forward positions. Thinking this force was the rumored Russian rear guard, Mortier ordered Gen. Gazan to counterattack and push east towards the town of Stein. Fighting spread though the villages of Oberloiben, Unterloiben and the farm at Rothenhof. Instead of withdrawing, as a rear guard would, more and more Russian troops appeared and engaged the French column.|$|E

5|$|On 2 November No. 47 Commando {{advanced}} through No. 48 Commando {{to attack}} a gun battery at Zouteland. The attack failed, with the unit suffering heavy casualties, including all the rifle troop commanders. The next day No. 47, supported by No. 48 Commando, again attacked the Zouteland gun battery. This time they managed to continue the advance and link up with No. 4 Commando. The capture of these batteries allowed the navy to start sweeping the channel into Antwerp for mines. On 5 November, No. 41 Commando captured the gun battery north east of Domburg; this <b>left</b> <b>only</b> one battery still under German control. The brigade regrouped and concentrated its assault on the last position. Just before the attack began on 9 November, the 4,000 men in the battery surrendered. This was quickly followed by the surrender {{of the rest of}} the island's garrison.|$|E

Harvard was the first Ivy League team ranked in the Coaches' Poll since the 2009–10 Cornell Big Red and the first Ivy League team ranked in the AP Poll since the 1997–98 Princeton Tigers. By January 2, the team achieved rankings of 22nd in the AP Poll and 21st in the Coaches' Poll. On February 6, the team again attained the ranking of 21st in the Coaches' Poll.|$|E
5|$|Reibey was funding {{all of the}} {{construction}} costs. When the structure was mostly complete a scandal erupted around him. He was alleged to have indecently dealt with a married woman. Her husband raised the issue with the bishop, then in 1870 with no action by the Church again with the Church of England Synod in England. Reibey subsequently took libel action but his complaint was dismissed and the Jury largely held that the allegations against him were true. Apart from these allegations, Reibey's wife's health had been declining, his property had been declining in value, and he wrote {{that he had been}} considering relinquishing the Archdeaconship for a while. After only a few years the lack of funds provided <b>left</b> <b>only</b> one person working on the site. All work ceased in 1870, by which time the walls were unfinished and the building still lacked a roof. Though the church was incomplete both Reibey and his wife Catherine were buried in a graveyard at the building's rear.|$|E

5|$|April brought further roster {{changes for}} the Hershey Bears, with Joel Rechlicz rejoining the team in {{exchange}} for Matt Clackson, and Stafford being traded for winger Dane Byers. Forward Michael Latta was also traded to Hershey, meaning the team had added seven new players to the roster via trades since January 31. The April trades were intended to add forward speed and depth to the team, but a late NHL trade deadline resulting from the lockout <b>left</b> <b>only</b> nine james to meld the new players into the line-up. After beating Syracuse 4–1 on April 5, Hershey fell into a four-game losing slump that briefly knocked them out of playoff contention. The first of those games, a 2-1 loss against Syracuse at home, drew a season-high attendance of 10,943. However, by April 12, a loss against Providence knocked them into ninth place, and last place in the East Division. Another loss {{the next day to}} Manchester left them tied with the Monarchs for last place at 75 points, a full four points behind Connecticut and Norfolk {{to get back into the}} running for the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|In 1511, a Spanish caravel was wrecked in the Caribbean, {{and about}} a dozen {{survivors}} made landfall {{on the coast of}} Yucatán. They were seized by a Maya lord, and most were sacrificed, although two managed to escape. From 1517 to 1519, three separate Spanish expeditions explored the Yucatán coast, and engaged in a number of battles with the Maya inhabitants. After the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan fell to the Spanish in 1521, Hernán Cortés despatched Pedro de Alvarado to Guatemala with 180 cavalry, 300 infantry, 4 cannons, and thousands of allied warriors from central Mexico; they arrived in Soconusco in 1523. The K'iche' capital, Q'umarkaj, fell to Alvarado in 1524. Shortly afterwards, the Spanish were invited as allies into Iximche, the capital city of the Kaqchikel Maya. Good relations did not last, due to excessive Spanish demands for gold as tribute, and the city was abandoned a few months later. This was followed by the fall of Zaculeu, the Mam Maya capital, in 1525. Francisco de Montejo and his son, Francisco de Montejo the Younger, launched a long series of campaigns against the polities of the Yucatán Peninsula in 1527, and finally completed the conquest of the northern portion of the peninsula in 1546. This <b>left</b> <b>only</b> the Maya kingdoms of the Petén Basin independent. In 1697, Martín de Ursúa launched an assault on the Itza capital Nojpetén and the last independent Maya city fell to the Spanish.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Werblin's co-owners {{gave him}} an ultimatum– either buy them out or be bought out. He chose the latter option, {{reportedly}} profiting $1.4million for his 1963 investment of $250,000. Prior to Werblin's departure, the Jets had considered firing Ewbank. They attempted to secure Green Bay Packers coach Vince Lombardi, but Lombardi decided to remain in Green Bay one more season. The season started with the usual three road games due to the team's status as secondary tenant to the Mets at Shea Stadium. The Jets rose {{to the top of}} the AFL East; they had lost only two games by mid-November and built a three-game lead over second-place Houston. New York's next game was at Oakland. In what became known as the Heidi Game, the Jets took a 32–29 lead with 68seconds <b>left,</b> <b>only</b> to have Oakland score two touchdowns to win the game. However, the touchdowns went unseen by much of the national TV audience, as NBC had switched at 7:00p.m. to a TV movie of Heidi. Nevertheless, the Jets won their remaining games to finish 11–3. In the playoffs, the Jets defeated the Raiders for the AFL Championship at Shea Stadium, 27–23, a game in which Namath threw three touchdowns, including the game winner to Don Maynard in the fourth quarter.|$|E
