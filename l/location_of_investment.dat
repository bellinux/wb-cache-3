40|$|We {{study the}} effects of tax laws on foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) and direct investment abroad (DIA), distinguishing in each case between investment financed by retained earnings and investment financed by transfers from abroad. We find that tax policy, through its effect on the rate-of-return available in the U. S., has an important effect on the international <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment.</b> FDI in the U. S. is very sensitive to after-tax rates-of-return available here. U. S. direct investment abroad is also affected, although to a lesser extent. We use these estimates to examine {{the effects of}} the 1981 - 82 tax changes on the international <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment.</b> We estimate that the tax changes lowered annual DIA by $ 0. 5 billion to $ 1. 0 billion (2 % to 4 % of its 1980 value), and raised annual FDI by $ 2 billion to $ 4 billion (11 % of 20 % of its 1980 value). We also discuss the welfare effects of tax policy toward international investment. Our results suggest that the tax effects on the international <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> are important. Tax policies, such as ACRS andthe ITC, which raise the after tax rate-of-return on new investment without losing revenue from previous investment, not only stimulate domestic fixed investment, but also attract additional investment from abroad. The additional investment supplements the domestic investment impact on productivity and raises corporate tax revenue. However, our results should be taken as preliminary estimates, not as definitive statements about the long-run impacts of tax policy. ...|$|E

This article reviews the factors that lead banks to locate their investment banking activities in a particular market. The author mentions three factors. First, history, and this holds true for the role within Europe of London where the first bond and equity issues of any significance took place. The second factor is the location of clients, be they issuers or investors. In the author’s view, however, trading activities can be located anywhere. The third factor is the growth strategy model of investment banks. This model, called a « tubular strategy », is characterized by development in a particular business segment followed by an offshoot in another segment in synergy with the first one. This growth model leads banks to operate close to specific client bases. The author illustrates his point with the example of HSBC, the second largest bank in the world.

Nowadays, firm-specific intangible assets as well as services often constitute the most important factors for the creation of value. Besides, geographic distances tend to be less relevant. The main objective of international tax planning consists of minimising the effective tax rate of the whole company or group. In this paper, it is examined for several instruments of international tax planning whether new chances of minimising the effective tax rate emerge with the use of ICT and to what extent new risks occur. The analysis comprises the (re) <b>location</b> <b>of</b> a company?s residence, the (re) allocation of functions and risks, the implementation of a transfer pricing system, the choice of the form and <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> abroad as well as hybrid forms of co-operation.

We conclude that, due to ICT, it is easier {{to make use of the}} international tax differential by choosing the optimal <b>location</b> and form <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> and by allocating functions and risks. Thus, companies can pay more attention to the tax-optimal choice between international locations and the importance of this instrument to reduce the effective tax rate is further strengthened by the use of ICT.

By using artificial transfer prices in these transactions and concentrating debt financing in highly taxed subsidiaries, a multinational can shift taxable income within its {{group of companies}} to reduce its overall tax burden and to achieve other objectives, such as bypassing capital controls.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{some aspects}} of the tax treatment of U. S. multinational corporations. The emphasis is on problems of coordination of the different tax systems faced by the firms. The U. S. corporate income tax must take account {{of the fact that the}} firms' over- seas income is taxed by the host governments, in a variety of ways. Currently, the foreign tax credit is the principle mechanism for making these adjustments; it is examined, along with alternative methods such as territorial treatment and a deduction for foreign taxes. The paper also considers the closely related question of coordinating measures of taxable income. The most common method, the arm's length rule, is examined. Alternatives to it, including allocation by shares and a partial case involving allocation of research and development expenses, are also considered.

It is their strategic decisions - those that determine the level and <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment,</b> employment and output - which ultimately shape the development path for Japanese industry (see Cowling and Sugden, 1994, 1998). In recent years, Japan’s large transnationals have become engaged in the process of elite globalisation, pursuing their own interests at the expense of domestic Japanese industry. This is a fundamental insight that is crucial for designing appropriate policy responses to arrest Japan's current industrial decline. It is argued that the lessons from Japan's experience might guide policymakers in other regions, such as Wisconsin, who are concerned with future industrial development, the effects of globalisation and problems of "hollowing out".
