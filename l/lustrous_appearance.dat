40|$|<b>Lustrous</b> surface <b>appearances</b> can be {{elicited}} {{by simple}} image configurations with no texture or specular highlights, as most prominently illustrated by Helmholtz' demonstration of stereoscopic lustre. Three types of explanatory framework {{have been proposed}} for stereoscopic lustre, which attribute the phenomenon to a binocular luminance conflict, an internalised physical regularity (Helmholtz), or to a disentangling of “essential” and “accidental” attributes in surface representations (Hering). In order to investigate these frameworks, we used haploscopically fused half-images of centre-surround configurations in which the luminances of the test patch were dynamically modulated. Experiment 1 shows that stereoscopic lustre is not specifically tied to situations of a luminance conflict between the eyes. Experiment 2 identifies a novel aspect in the binocular temporal dynamics that provides a physical basis for <b>lustrous</b> <b>appearances,</b> namely the occurrence of a temporal luminance counter-modulation between the eyes. This feature sheds {{some light on the}} internal principles underlying a disentangling of “accidental” and “essential” surface attributes. Experiment 3 reveals an asymmetry between a light and a dark reference level for the counter-modulations. This finding again suggests an interpretation in terms of an internalised physical regularity with respect to the dynamics of perceiving illuminated surfaces...|$|R

40|$|Thin {{films of}} {{zirconium}} oxide have been deposited using pulsed laser deposition on Zr-base alloy substrates, held at 300 K, 573 K and 873 K, {{in order to}} understand the effect of substrate temperature on the deposited film. In this study, a KrF excimer laser having 30 ns pulse width and 600 mJ energy at source has been used for depositing the films from a sintered ZrO 2 target using a laser fluence of 5 J. cm- 2. After visual observation, deposited thin films were examined using Raman Spectroscopy (RS) and X-ray Photo-electron Spectroscopy (XPS). It has been found that the oxide deposited at 300 K temperature does not show good adherence with the substrate. The oxide films deposited at 573 K and 873 K are found to be adherent with the substrate and <b>lustrous</b> black in <b>appearance.</b> Thin films of zirconia, deposited using pulsed laser on the Zr-base metallic substrate are initially in amorphous state and possibly little deficient in oxygen. The substrate temperature and the duration of holding at high temperature are responsible for the evolution of nanocrystals in the deposited thin films. The stoichiometry of the amorphous oxide film supports its crystallization, below 573 K, into monoclinic and tetragonal phases and not into cubic phase...|$|R

500|$|Many {{nonmetals}} {{have less}} stable allotropes, with either nonmetallic or metallic properties. Graphite, the standard state of carbon, has a <b>lustrous</b> <b>appearance</b> {{and is a}} fairly good electrical conductor. The diamond allotrope of carbon is clearly nonmetallic, however, being translucent and having a relatively poor electrical conductivity. Carbon is also known in several other allotropic forms, including semiconducting buckminsterfullerene (C60). Nitrogen can form gaseous tetranitrogen (N4), an unstable polyatomic molecule with a lifetime of about one microsecond. Oxygen is a diatomic molecule in its standard state; it also exists as ozone (O3), an unstable polyatomic nonmetallic allotrope with a half-life of around half an hour. Phosphorus, uniquely, exists in several allotropic forms that are more stable than that of its standard state as white phosphorus (P4). The red and black allotropes are probably the best known; both are semiconductors; black phosphorus, in addition, has a <b>lustrous</b> <b>appearance.</b> Phosphorus {{is also known as}} diphosphorus (P2), an unstable diatomic allotrope. Sulfur has more allotropes than any other element; all of these, except plastic sulfur (a metastable ductile mixture of allotropes) have nonmetallic properties. Selenium has several nonmetallic allotropes, all of which are much less electrically conducting than its standard state of grey [...] "metallic" [...] selenium. Iodine is also known in a semiconducting amorphous form. Under sufficiently high pressures, just over half of the nonmetals, starting with phosphorus at 1.7GPa, have been observed to form metallic allotropes.|$|E

40|$|The chapter {{outlines}} {{an abstract}} theoretical framework {{that is currently}} (re-) emerging {{in the course of}} a theoretical convergence of several disciplines. In the first section, the fundamental problem of perception theory is formulated, namely, the generation, by the perceptual system, of meaningful categories from physicogeometric energy patterns. In the second section, it deals with basic intuitions and assumptions underlying what can be regarded as the current Standard Model of Perceptual Psychology and points out why this model is profoundly inadequate for dealing with the fundamental problem of perception theory. In the third section, it discusses a level of analysis that promises to be fruitful for dealing, in conformity with established procedures of the natural sciences, with the problem of perceptual “meaning” and the problem of what constitutes a “perceptual object. ” In the fourth section, it outlines a theoretical perspective on basic principles of the perceptual system which centers on the notions of complex data types and conceptual forms, and draws an entirely different theoretical picture of the role of the sensory input than traditional accounts. The final section focusses on the issue of material qualities and discusses, within the general theoretical framework outlined, some observations and results on the perception of certain material properties, namely, <b>lustrous</b> and glassy <b>appearances...</b>|$|R
40|$|Labneh is made commercially by {{different}} methods. The {{effects of processing}} methods in five diary plants on labneh composition, physiochemical properties and, sensoric quality were studied. The composition of labneh made {{by different}} methods differ significantly. Labneh made from yoghurt with 25 % total solids had the highest fat, protein and lactose content. All labneh samples met the Saudi Standards for fat but, only samples from one plant met the solids not fat requirement. Labneh made from recombined milk had higher titratable acidity and proteolysis than labneh made from fresh milk. Labneh made from fresh milk with yoghurt culture had higher proteolysis and lipolysis than that made with buttermilk culture. Labneh produced from fresh milk by the traditional method was superior in all organoleptic properties to all other labnesh samples. However, fresh labneh made by the new mechanized method was inferior to all other samples. This was attributed to yogurt pasteurization {{and the addition of}} gelatin as stabilizer. This labneh had <b>lustrous</b> weak jelly <b>appearance</b> and foreign chemical odor and taste. Samples made from recombined milk (from plants 3, 4, and 5) were similar in most of their sensoric properties. Even though the traditional method produced a superior labneh, the mechanized method could be improved to produce good labneh. Due to the similarities between labneh and quarg, the quarg manufacturing technology could be adopted for labneh production...|$|R

50|$|Mercerization is a {{treatment}} for cotton fabric and thread that gives fabric or yarns a <b>lustrous</b> <b>appearance</b> and strengthens them. The process is applied to cellulosic materials like cotton or hemp. A further possibility is mercerizing during which the fabric is treated with sodium hydroxide solution to cause swelling of the fibres. This results in improved lustre, strength and dye affinity. Cotton is mercerized under tension, and all alkali must be washed out before the tension is released or shrinkage will take place. Mercerizing can take place directly on greige cloth, or after bleaching.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Silk {{has always}} been the symbol of royalty due to its <b>lustrous</b> <b>appearance</b> and peach like softness. The {{coloration}} of this royal fiber is also an art form. The process varies largely in the form of hanks and woven pieces. There are numerous ranges of dyestuff available for use of silk dyeing. Almost every class of dyestuff used for cotton or wool can be used for dyeing silk. In general the dyestuffs are applied by techniques similar to those of wool or cotton. This research paper shows a comparative analysis of silk dyeing with acid dye, which is commonly used and reactive dye, which is more commonly applied on cotton. The study focuses on the dye uptake, different types of fastness properties and the strength of the dyed samples. It was found that reactive dyes showed better dye uptake and color fastness on silk than acid dyes but comparatively the strength of the fibre was decreased...|$|E
40|$|A film growth mechanism, {{expressed}} in terms of depositing hard films onto the soft substrate, was proposed. Multicomponent thin films of Ti-Si-N were deposited onto Al substrate with a double-target magnetron sputtering system in an Ar-N 2 gas mixture. The Ti-Si-N films were investigated by characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscope (AFM), electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA), scratch test and nanoindentation. The as-deposited films have a good adhesion to Al substrate and appear with smooth and lustrous surface. The films show nanocomposite structure with nano TiN grains embedded in an amorphous SiNx matrix. The maximum hardness of the films was achieved as high as 27 GPa. The influences of the N 2 flow rate and substrate temperature on the growth rate and quality of the films were also discussed. For all samples, the Ar flow rate was maintained constant at 10 ml⋅min− 1, while the flow rate of N 2 was varied to analyze the structural changes related to chemical composition and friction coefficient. The low temperature in the deposited Ti-Si-N films favors the formation of crystalline TiN, and it leads to a lower hardness at low N 2 flow rate. At the same time, the thin films deposited are all crystallized well and bonded firmly to Al substrate, with smooth and <b>lustrous</b> <b>appearance</b> and high hardness provided. The results indicate that magnetron sputtering is a promising method to deposit hard films onto soft substrate...|$|E
40|$|Betalains are {{comprised}} of red-violet betacyanins and yellow betaxanthins. These water soluble vacuolar plant pigments confer vibrant colours to flowers, fruits and other organs of plants in 13 {{families of the}} order Caryophyllales. Their presence is mutually exclusive with the more common anthocyanins. By comparison, relatively {{little is known about}} regulation of their synthesis and of their functional roles. Tyrosine is the precursor to betalains, and there are few downstream enzymatic steps to production of the first coloured compounds. Thus, the betalain biosynthesis pathway is relatively amenable to molecular investigation. One of the best characterised enzymes in the pathway is DOPA 4, 5 -dioxygenase. It is encoded by the DODA gene and converts L-Dopa into betalamic acid. Genes responsible for some other enzymatic steps in betalain synthesis have not yet been identified. The flower of an Australian native plant, Calandrinia sp. nov., contains all basic colours associated with betalain biosynthesis (viz. violet, red-orange, yellow and white) within single petals. The concentrically-zoned phenotype is, thus, modulated developmentally and spatially, and represents a novel genetic system for the study of betalain biosynthesis regulation. To date, our HPLC and LCMS analyses showed that the violet petal sectors contained four betacyanin pigments. Distinct from most other betalain-containing plant species, the simplest betacyanin, the aglycone betanidin, was the predominant pigment. Yellow petal sectors contained four different betaxanthin pigments. A mix of violet betacyanins and yellow betaxanthins was found in red petal sectors, where betanidin was the major betacyanin and the betaxanthin composition was similar to that of yellow petal sectors. Microscopy revealed that the betacyanin pigments are expressed in long, multiple-papillate epidermal petal cells. Epidermal cell structure may contribute to the highly <b>lustrous</b> <b>appearance</b> of Calandrinia sp. nov. flowers.
