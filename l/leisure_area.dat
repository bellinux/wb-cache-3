500|$|The late 19th-century {{chief of}} the Bani Zeid sheikhdom, Sheikh Salih al-Barghouti, resided in a large palace-like manor in Deir Ghassaneh. The first floor and {{portions}} of the second floor were originally built in 1602. In 1862-63 Sheikh Salih renovated the manor which became known locally as [...] "Saraya al-Sheikh Salih al-Barghouti" [...] and built {{the remainder of the}} second floor. The building was divided into three main components, namely the salamlek, the khazeen and the haramlek. The salamlek included a reception area, dining halls and a guesthouse while the khazeen consisted of workshops, food depots and horse stables. The haramlek, on the second floor, served as the living quarters for women and servants.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the consumption of alcohol {{and a range of}} violent crimes, including homicide, is overwhelmingly acknowledged by criminologists. Less is known about the specifics of this relationship—in particular, whether the worst alcohol related violence occurs in private, or in public settings such as Australia’s expanding night-time <b>leisure</b> <b>areas.</b> This study finds no evidence of a substantial concentration of homicides in specific night-time <b>leisure</b> <b>areas.</b> Homicides are, however, both directly and indirectly related to the night-time economy, with indirectly related incidents outweighing others. This finding affirms the need to persist with strategies to limit intoxication associated with night-time leisure, and further explore ways to control the sale of and access to alcohol in the general community...|$|R

2500|$|Gravesend is {{associated}} with Major-General Charles Gordon (1833–1885), {{who lived in the}} town during the construction of the Thames forts.

As commanding officer of the Royal Engineers from 1865 to 1871, {{he was in charge of}} the forts guarding the Thames downstream from Gravesend, New Tavern Fort in the town, Shornemead Fort on the Thames's south bank, and Coalhouse Fort on the north in Essex.

2500|$|According to Lipson, every prop for {{the tour}} had to be recreated many times due {{to a number of}} reasons, making it [...] "not an easy build by any stretch". Tom Banks from Design Week {{magazine}} visited the area underneath the stage which was about [...] tall only, where the dancers changed, props were handed and performers reached the stage often through numerous hydraulic lifts. Banks further described the space as a [...] "subterranean area, which is the footprint beneath the stage rather than back-stage. It's a maze of tunnels, wires and props interrupted only by platforms poised to send performers up into the light". Madonna was transported on a trolley {{from one end to the}} other end of the stage. She had a makeshift make-up room in the underneath area, for having touch-ups in between performances. In total, the stage and the equipment required 27 semitrailers and 187 staff member to haul them across Europe and North America. However, for the Oceania shows, three Boeing 747 airliners were hired. The singer flew to each location in her private jet, turning up at the venue in mid-afternoon with her entourage. Everyone involved in the performance does soundcheck and safety checks. The staging also enclosed a <b>leisure</b> <b>area,</b> with different forms of entertainment. Madonna's actual dressing room consisted of furniture, pictures and gym equipment, along with lots of flowers.|$|E

40|$|Information and Communication Technology (ICT) {{has changed}} the way we work and live. New specialisations of ICT have evolved over the time, {{including}} business informatics, environmental informatics, health informatics, bio-informatics and social informatics. Though ICT is being used in almost all <b>leisure</b> <b>areas</b> of people, there is no study area or specialisation in ICT that covers these <b>leisure</b> <b>areas.</b> The specialisation <b>leisure</b> informatics was coined by us to bridge this gap. We define leisure informatics as a new specialisation in ICT that deals with gathering, processing, analysing, storage and dissemination of information to facilitate decision making in any <b>area</b> of <b>leisure</b> such as sports & recreation, tourism & hospitality, music & entertainment, and meditation & relaxation. This paper introduces the leisure informatics specialisation and discusses the research and teaching possibilities involving mathematics and data mining in this new specialisation...|$|R

40|$|Design for All {{is largely}} {{influencing}} planning, rehabilitation and refurbishment {{of various types}} of the built environment.
