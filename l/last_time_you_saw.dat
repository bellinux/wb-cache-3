2500|$|In 1988, Journalist for USA Today, Matt Roush, {{described}} Sue and Ali {{as two of}} the serial's more colourful residents. Discussing the cotdeath storyline, which {{aired in}} 1985 in the UK, Roush said, [...] "When tragedy strikes, {{as in the case}} of Ali (Nejdet Salih) and jealous wife [...] (Sandy Ratcliff), EastEnders becomes achingly believable. Try to remember the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> soap stars deal with the bureaucracy of registering death certificates and canceling welfare benefits." ...|$|E

The <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> the upper one," [...] said Captain Dan with a smile, [...] "you were {{seated in the}} Wesleyan chapel, {{and he was in}} the pulpit dressed like a gentleman, and preaching as eloquently {{as if he had been}} educated at college and trained for the ministry." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then {{came the}} power of {{cross-examination}} {{on the part of}} the prisoner. He made no attempt to modify what had been said before, but asked in a gentle apologetic voice: [...] "Was that the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>saw,</b> or thought <b>you</b> <b>saw,</b> Peregrine Oakshott?" ...|$|R

6000|$|So {{difficult}} {{is it for}} an ambassador to dabble in treasonable intrigue, especially when old, and {{when the weather is}} wet. Let us suppose that Goring and the Earl met. Goring's business was to ask if the Earl 'has leave to disclose the secret that was not in his power to do, <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> him. I am ready to come myself, and meet him where he pleases.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Suppose {{you go back}} to Dexter," [...] he proceeded. [...] "And {{suppose that}} the doctor's opinion exaggerates the peril in his case. What are you to do? The <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> him, you had the immense {{advantage}} of taking him by surprise. Those sensitive nerves of his gave way, and he betrayed the fear that you aroused in him. Can you take him by surprise again? Not you! He is prepared for you now; and he will be on his guard. If you encounter nothing worse, you will have his cunning to deal with next. Are you his match at that? But for Lady Clarinda he would have hopelessly misled you on the subject of Mrs. Beauly." ...|$|E
50|$|Comedy is Rajpal Yadav's forte {{and he does}} it well. When was the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> Jimmy Sheirgill dance? After doing {{a series}} of solid serious roles,the actor tries his hand at comedy and fares well. The song and dance routine looks too cliched and {{unnecessary}} though.|$|E

5000|$|Joystiqs JC Fletcher {{described}} her in Shadow Assassins as a [...] "totally hardcore stone-cold killer" [...] and scarier than Rimikaru, but criticized Heather Hogans British accent as putting off. Gelo Gonzales of FHM ranked Ayame and Rikimaru {{as well as}} Tatsumaru from Tenchu 2 at fourth place on his 2009 list of most memorable hitmen in gaming, and Complex included Rikimaru and Ayame from Tenchu 3 among their favourite video game stealth killers, rhetorically asking in 2010: [...] "Whens the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> a male/female duo this brutally deadly?" [...] Jack Chambers of WhatCulture put them both at seventh spot on his 2012 list of unstoppable assassins in video games, opining that [...] "the deadly combination of Rikimaru and Ayame hasn’t rarely been matched in any game since" [...] the original Tenchu.|$|E

5000|$|Multiple {{publications}} praised Rikimaru {{on their}} {{lists of the}} top ninja characters in video games. In 2004, 1UP.com ranked him as the fourth best video game ninja yet and [...] "the truest old-school ninja on this list." [...] The Armchair Empire had Ayame and Rikimaru tied for sixth spot in on their 2006 list of ten best ninja characters; in 2010, Wild Gunmen ranked Rikimaru as the second best ninja in video game history for his use of stealth and being [...] "a total badass."

In 2013, Complex ranked him as the tenth best assassin in video games, stating: [...] "Nothing wrong with Ayame, but this master assassin just oozes pure awesome." ...|$|E
40|$|When was the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> an {{isosurface}} with error bars or streamlines {{with standard}} deviations or volume visualizations with representations of confidence intervals? With few exceptions, visualization research has ignored the visual representation of errors and uncertainty for 3 D visualizations. However, {{if you look}} at peer-reviewed science and engineering journals, you will see that the majority of 2 D graphs represent error and/or uncertainty within the experimental or simulated data. Why the difference? Clearly, if it’s important to represent error and uncertainty in 2 D graphs, then it’s equally important to represent error and uncertainty in 2 D and 3 D visualization. The possible detriment caused by the failure to represent errors and uncertainties in 3 D visualization...|$|E
40|$|The {{other day}} I spotted a {{tractor-trailer}} rig with amessage {{on the side}} that caught my eye. It said,“You need it? It’s in here. ” This message has often been stated another way, “America’s needs move by truck. ” For better or for worse, these statements are no exaggeration. When was the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> a Wal-Mart SuperCenter or a Home Depot or a Target or any other stadium-sized store located near a railroad track or a ship docking facility? The fact is that America’s trucking indus-try is a cornerstone of our economy and our culture. And all those trucks bringing all those goods within convenient reach of all our homes, guzzle oceans of diesel fuel that is dispensed at {{a relatively small number}} of fuel-ing facilities. In 2004, U. S. vehicles consumed 37. 3 billion gallons of diesel fuel. According to the National Associa-tion of Truckstop Operators (NATSO) website, three-quarters of this diesel fuel is pumped through facilitie...|$|E

40|$|Much of our {{popular culture}} and the {{institutions}} that support it honor the warrior and ignore the peacemaker. The technologies of death seem to receive disproportionate attention compared to the technologies of life. The Pentagon spends {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars annually to promote service in the military, with a good part of this total emphasizing the development and use of military technologies. When was the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> an advertisement or recruiting notice promising engineers an exciting and rewarding career in promoting peaceful solutions through the application of technologies? Perhaps you happened to see a Peace Corps ad on late night TV, but probably nothing more. Military occupations, especially those involving the application of modern technologies, capture the attention of the public and give it high visibility and support. Humanitarian engineering, on the other hand, is not a well-defined concept and receives little or no attention from the public. As a result, humanitarian engineering as a career track for young professionals barely exists and is difficult to identify. Let me give you my definition of humanitarian engineering. First, take the characteristics of a typical military recruiting advertisement – professional growth, foreign travel, service to country...|$|E
