40|$|Fluidization is an {{engineering}} unit operation {{that occurs when}} a fluid (liquid or gas) ascends through a bed of particles, and these particles get a velocity of minimum fluidization enough to stay in suspension, but without carrying them in the ascending flow. As from this moment the powder behaves as liquid at boiling point, hence the term “fluidization”. This operation is widely used in the aluminum smelter processes, for gas dry scrubbing (mass transfer) and in a modern plant for continuous <b>alumina</b> <b>pot</b> feeding (particles’ momentum transfer).

40|$|The {{composition}} and properties of blast furnace slags greatly affect the furnace productivity {{and the quality}} of hot metal produced. Viscosity is an important physical property of slags, strongly influenced by the chemical composition, structure and the temperature. Experimental measurement of slag viscosity requires high temperature equipment and is time consuming. Therefore, chemical parameters are used to identify trends in viscosity as function of chemical composition. Limited information is available for High Alumina Blast Furnace Slags, since much of the open literature deals with <b>Low</b> <b>Alumina</b> Slags, with alumina content less than 15 weight percentage. High Alumina slags (alumina content in the range of 15 % to 30 %) are predominantly encountered in Indian Blast Furnaces. It appears that these slags have higher viscosity and lower sulphide capacity than the <b>low</b> <b>alumina</b> slags. The effect of chemical composition / ionic structure on viscosity has been interpreted in this work, using the chemical parameter of optical basicity. Data reported in the literature have been used, along with the values of liquidus temperature, for high alumina slags. Three slag systems, i. e., CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2, CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 -MgO and CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 -MgO-TiO 2 have been considered in this work. The trends observed are discussed in the paper...|$|R

Increasing the heat treatment temperature led to the incorporation of Er 3 + ions into CaF 2 crystals and also increased the Yb 3 + concentration in them.

Alternative ways for clinker preparation’’ and the aim {{is the development of}} ways for the preparation of hydraulic calciumsilicate and calciumaluminate ccompounds and materials through wet chemical synthesis. Specifically, the following materials were prepared through sol-gel and polymeric precursor routes: 3 CaO. SiO 2, 2 CaO. SiO 2, 3 CaO. Al 2 O 3 and 4 CaO. Al 2 O 3. Fe 2 O 3. 3 CaO. Al 2 O 3 - 4 CaO. Al 2 O 3. Fe 2 O 3 mixture. three standard types of calcium aluminate cements (High <b>Alumina</b> - HA, <b>Low</b> <b>Alumina</b> - LA και Standard <b>Low</b> <b>Alumina</b> - SLA) The effect of the starting conditions (ratios of reactants, temperature, pH) on the preparation of the precursor material and the sintering conditions on the final product was examined. Solid-state synthesis was also applied for comparison reasons. Finally, a combination of techniques (DTA/TG, XRD, FTIR, SEM) is applied for the characterization of the intermediate and final products. As it was concluded the polymeric precursor route can be successfully applied for the synthesis of the hydraulic compounds and materials. All the compounds and materials (with the exception of 3 CaO. SiO 2) are satisfactorily formed after a three-hour sintering at 1000 oC. The formation of 3 CaO. SiO 2 requires a three-hour sintering at 1500 oC. The sintering products are close to the equilibrium compounds and this must be taken into consideration for the calculation of raw materials’ composition. Finally, the kind of cement synthesis (conventional or Pechini) does not have any effect on the reactions of hydration and the nature of hydration products. The starting conditions strongly affect the preparation procedure. In the polymeric precursor route, the determinative conditions are the reactants ratios, the gelation temperature and the drying temperature. In the sol-gel synthesis, the determinative conditions are the order of the solutions’ addition, ratios of the H 2 O, ΤΕΟS and EtOH and the agitation of the starting solution. The kind of catalysis (basic or acidic) does not affect the final product. The final products consist of fine and uniform grains. β- 2 CaO. SiO 2 is obtained without chemical stabilizers or sudden cooling. The way of preparation does not affect the hydration reactions and products. The combination of TG/DTG, XRD, FTIR and SEM leads to the recording of all the transformations occurring during the processing of the precursors and the formation of the final products. ...|$|R

We prepared these composites by dissolving {{them in a}} liquid solvent, and characterized them through impedance spectroscopy (IS), using a Pt/electrolyte/Pt electrode configuration. The combination of polyethylene oxide (PEO) with sodium trifluoroacetate (CF 3 COONa) produced a reduction in resistance of up to two orders of magnitude in Nyquist plots, and up to three orders of magnitude when we added Al 2 O 3 particles at room  temperature.

Two sections of the conductivity diagrams also evidenced a temperature induced Arrhenius behavior, indicating a thermally activated process. Higher concentrations of Al 2 O 3 induced a Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher (VTF) behavior.

The parent rock-types of this raw material are the Oligocene-Miocene rhyolitic-rhyodacitic ignimbrites. Chemical and mineralogical analyses were performed on representative samples of each deposit, by XRD and XRF methodologies. The chemical analyses generally show high silica and <b>low</b> <b>alumina</b> contents in all samples, typical of weakly kaolinized materials. The main mineralogical association consists of kaolinite and cristobalite with quartz and smectite as the minor components.

The Patalza deposit exhibits low iron and sulphur contents, but low plasticity and excessive refractoriness. The Patalza materials can be used as unconventional raw materials to replace both kaolin and silica in white-firing bodies. Results show that the introduction of the Patalza "kaolins" was well tolerated in bodies for tableware, wall and floor tiles, without significant changes in porosity, bulk density, pore size distribution and coefficient of thermal expansion. The main drawback of using the Patalza material is the slight increase of firing shrinkage, while the main advantage is a systematic increase in mechanical resistance...|$|R

The origin of these high-magnesium clays has long been attributed to either alteration of volcanic ash or the structural transformation f smectite clays. More recently, others have argued origin by direct crystallization (eo-formation). Recent laboratory studies upport this latter concept, particularly inenvironments where the concentration f <b>alumina</b> is <b>low,</b> the silica concentration high, and the pH alkaline. Such an origin is proposed for the Georgia-Florida eposits in southeastern U-ited States, since major obstacles exist against formation by alteration of volcanic ash or by transfor-marion of smectites. Lateritic weathering during the Miocene would have favored irect precipitation of these clays in the shallow, marginal seas. The basinward increase in the MgO: AI~O 3 ratio is further support. Deep weathering of crystalline rocks in northern British Honduras and Guatemala would have produced similar high silica, <b>low</b> <b>alumina</b> conditions on the adjacent submerged Yucatan Platform dur-ing the late Tertiary. The seaward increase in the MgO:Al 203 ratio, the lack of associated detrital constituents, {{and the absence of}} associated smectites strongly indicate a similar origin by direct crys-tallization of these Yucatan palygorsldte-sepiolite clays.

Conflicting experimental results from researchers reporting heat transfer enhancement, deterioration, and no effect make it impossible to state a specific trend. However, it seems that the particle concentration and size {{have a significant impact on}} the reported results. Das et al. [15] reported that nanofluids that exhibit nucleate boiling heat transfer coefficient deterioration typically have high particle concentrations (4 % to 16 % by weight), while enhancement is typically found at relatively low particle concentrations (< 1.25 % by weight). Kim et al. [14], however, reported a significant decrease in heat transfer coefficients at low (< 0.1 % by volume) particle concentrations of alumina, silica, and zirconia nanofluids. Additionally, Kim et al. [16] demonstrated that the relative surface wettability of the deposited nanoparticles compared with a clean surface significantly affected the boiling performance. Narayan et al. [17] found both deterioration and enhancement of the heat transfer coefficient at relatively <b>low</b> <b>alumina</b> particle concentrations (0.5 to 2 wt.%) in water. They explained that this apparent conflict could be resolved when the ratio of the average surface roughness to the average particle diameter was accounted for. When this parameter was near unity, they found that boiling deterioration was the most dramatic, which they theorized was caused by the nanoparticles plugging the nucleation sites, inhibiting heat transfer.|$|R

The properties of mullite, such as, low thermal expansion, low dielectric constant and high mechanical resistance, make this material as a good candidate to be applied in electronic products and in structural high temperature uses. In this work, compositions with residue from kaolin, alumina and ball-clay were studied to obtain mullite. The compositions were established starting from proportion between silica and alumina to obtain mullite (2 SiO 2. 3 Al 2 O 3). The samples were made by pressing processing with 27 MPa and sintering at temperatures of 1350 and 1500 °C, with heating rate of 10 °C/min. Through the results from chemical analysis of the formulated masses, it can be verified that the proportions of the oxides were close to the stoichiometric of the mullite and that the sintering, at studied temperatures, give the formation of mullite, and confirmed by the DRX analysis.

The effect of the concentration {{of each of the}} four component oxides (Na 2 O, SiO 2, Al 2 O 3 and H 2 O) and two alkali cations (Na and K) on the microstructure and compressive strengths were assessed. Similar to metakaolin-derived inorganic polymers, it was observed that high-strength fly ash inorganic polymers were related to low porosity and a dense, fine-grained microstructure. Such structures were characteristic of formulations with high silica mole fractions (SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ~ 3. 9) and low water contents, as well as those with high alkali and <b>low</b> <b>alumina</b> contents.

The principal limitation to commercialization of the process was a <b>low</b> <b>alumina</b> deposition rate. Over the past three years the alumina deposition rate has been increased from 1 nm/s to 20 nm/s. The next step is to produce material in a roll format. A roll coater has been built to process 30. 48 -cm wide rolls of solar reflective material. A steel strip with a highly specular surface finish will be used as the web material. The advantage of this material compared to polyester is that it withstands a higher process temperature and lowers final product installation costs. A major technical challenge will be to reproduce high reflector durability in a continuous, high rate process...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{metamorphic}} {{study of}} mid-P anatectic aluminous gneisses from the Manicouagan and lac du Milieu {{areas of the}} central Grenville Province. The rocks are derived from hydrothermally altered felsic protoliths and were metamorphosed at granulite facies conditions during the Grenvillian orogeny. The samples come from three locations separated by several tens of kilometers and exhibit {{a wide range of}} textures and bulk compositions. However, they all have the same peak mineral assemblage: garnet + biotite + quartz + K-feldspar +/- plagioclase +/- sillimanite with retrograde cordierite in some, and show evidence of partial melting and melt loss. In terms of mineralogy and bulk composition, the samples were divided into two groups, sillimanite-rich and sillimanite-poor, with a high and <b>low</b> <b>Alumina</b> index in the AFM space, respectively. Phase equilibria modeling in the Na₂O–CaO–K₂O–FeO–MgO–Al₂O₃–SiO₂–H₂O– TiO₂–O (NCKFMASTHO) system using Thermocalc constrained the P–T field of the peak mineral assemblage at 800 – 900 ºC and 6 – 11 kbar, with melt solidification in the range of 800 – 865 ºC and 6 – 8 kbar. The presence of sillimanite inclusions in garnet, and of only scarce, retrograde cordierite, is consistent with moderate dP/dT gradient ‘hairpin’ P– T paths, which were similar between the three locations. This study also investigated the role of Fe 3 + on phase stability in mid-P aluminous systems. Fe³⁺ is problematic because although it is incorporated in the NaCKFMASTHO system, it is rarely measured in modeled minerals and rocks and its value is generally assumed. Biotite may contain significant amounts of Fe³⁺, and these were analysed by Mössbauer spectroscopy in selected samples, where they were found to be low (0 - 4...|$|R
40|$|This paper reports {{findings}} of ongoing {{investigation into the}} effect of high alumina ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) on sulphate resistance of concrete. Slags used in most countries contain <b>low</b> <b>alumina</b> contents and provide high resistance to sulphate attack among other durability improvements. It is however known that slags of high alumina contents do not necessarily improve sulphate resistance but may otherwise adversely influence concrete performance. South African slags have moderately high alumina contents but hardly any {{studies have been conducted}} to determine its influence on sulphate resistance of concretes. In this investigation, commercially available slag widely used in South Africa was used. Mortar prisms 25 x 25 x 285 mm of 0. 5 water-binder ratio incorporating 30 %, 50 %, 70 % GGBS were prepared and immersed in sodium sulphate solutions of different concentrations of 28 g/L and 50 g/L as SO 4. Expansion and mass change of the cementitious systems were monitored. Variables examined were compressive strengths prior to immersion in Na 2 SO 4 solution, slag replacement levels, concentrations of sulphate solutions. It was found that the moderately high alumina slag improved resistance to sulphate attack in correspondence with increase in the replacement levels of the extender. Mixtures that were not cured to develop 20 MPa initial strength prior to exposure in Na 2 SO 4 solution, showed elevated early age expansion while their cured counterparts did not expand. The long-term expansions of mixtures that had not been cured were much higher than expansions of the respective cured mixes. Interestingly, the use of GGBS in proportions exceeding 50 % mitigated the adverse effects of early age expansions giving no long-term expansions in any of the mixtures containing the extender...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Impact fatigue {{behavior}} of fully dense alumina as we studied in this work. The effect of grain size {{on the impact}} fatigue characteristics has been found out using a simple impact fatigue test set-up. <b>Low</b> grained <b>alumina</b> was prepared using optimized slip mcasting technique where as higher grained samples were made following conventional powdered metallurgy technique (Compaction through isostatic pressing and subsequent solid sate sintering. All though the mechanical behavior (e. g. hardness, toughness) was better in fine grained alumina, It was more succeptable to impact fatigue. Some of the sampled in higher grained alumina samples were little bit elongated in shape with aspect ratio close to 2 - 2. 5. Fractoghaphy revealed that crack propagation was predominantly mixed mode. The elongated grains promoted bridging across crack front and caused higher resistance to fatigue...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} a compact passive hydrogen maser with unique features including {{a reduction in}} size. It uses a passive operation mode, permitting {{the use of a}} small microwave TE(011) cavity dielectrically loaded by a <b>low</b> loss <b>alumina.</b> The Teflon coated quartz bulb common in other masers {{has been replaced by a}} Teflon coating on the inside wall of the cavity producing a simpler designed and a more rugged H-maser package. The cavity and the attached endcaps comprise the vacuum envelope, allowing the use of a single vacuum system. The dimensional stability of the ceramic cavity under barometric changes is sufficiently within the range of the electronic cavity servo so that a second vacuum system is not required. For temperature control, a single oven is located in the magnetic shield nest...|$|R
40|$|Some <b>low</b> purity <b>alumina</b> {{ceramics}} with an alumina content {{ranging from}} 86 % to 93 % were investigated, {{in order to}} explore the effects of microstructural parameters (grain size, intergranular phase) on mechanical (wear) and dielectrical parameters. The microstructure and worn surfaces were analysed using scaning electron microscopy. The correlation between microstructural, dielectrical properties and wear is discussed. It has been proposed that mechanical and electrical properties are two aspects of the same fundamental mechanism. The wear behaviour of alumina ceramics were very sensitive {{to the structure of}} the materials (phase, porosity, toughness, hardness, grain size) as underlined by several authors [1 - 3]. During sliding of alumina ceramics, typically brittle materials, fracture mechanisms become operative that generate wear debris. The wear debris can undergo crushing, compaction and smearing to form, o...|$|R

The features of this CHM, {{which is designed to}} operate initially at 4. 2 K, are the use of <b>low</b> loss <b>alumina,</b> and later sapphire, in the fabrication of the microwave cavity; possible use of superconductors for shielding; use of a cryogenic amplifier; possible coating material; and a reliable RF discharge circuit for the dissociation of hydrogen.
