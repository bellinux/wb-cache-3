In 1970, when Moore’s Law {{was still a}} relatively new idea, and when the most powerful computers had 1,000 to 2,000 logic gates, Ledley wrote a paper titled “Realization of a Billion-Gate Computer” in which he speculated on the capabilities of a transistorized computer that had 1,000,000,000 logic gates. He proposed that such a machine would: 1) have no fixed logic design; 2) be capable of redesign some of its own components; 3) be able to “self-heal.” Billion-transistor microprocessors have been commonplace in personal computers since 2010, though these machines are not as dynamic (in terms of <b>logic</b> <b>structure)</b> as Ledley had predicted.|$|E

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{potential}} for extremely high asynchronous logic performance in CMOS and GaAs dynamic <b>logic</b> <b>structures.</b> By using {{a new class of}} GaAs dynamic logic, Pseudo-Dynamic Latched Logic, we develop asynchronous control structures capable of high-speed operation. We show how these techniques can be used for CMOS design, and give performance estimates. I Introduction Asynchronous approaches have long been touted as the ideal replacement for synchronous designs when clock skew problems and power consumption become unmanageable. However, the lack of asynchronous method acceptance seems to indicate that these views are not shared by the design community as a whole. This is primarly due to the lower performance level offered by asynchronous solutions in a given technology than that achievable by a synchronous system. In this paper, we explore {{the potential for}} exploiting very high speed operation of CMOS and GaAs dynamic <b>logic</b> <b>structures</b> using a two-phase signalling, boundeddelay en [...] ...|$|R
