50|$|The term {{load testing}} {{is used in}} {{different}} ways in the professional software testing community. Load testing generally refers {{to the practice of}} modeling the expected usage of a software program by simulating multiple users accessing the program concurrently. As such, this testing is most relevant for multi-user systems; often one built using a client/server model, such as web servers. However, other types of software systems can also be <b>load</b> <b>tested.</b> For example, a word processor or graphics editor can be forced to read an extremely large document; or a financial package can be forced to generate a report based on several years' worth of data. The most accurate load testing simulates actual use, as opposed to testing using theoretical or analytical modeling.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT It {{has been}} {{believed}} that the static <b>load</b> <b>test</b> is the most reliable method to obtain the load-settlement relation of a pile. Most static <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> are conducted using reaction piles as the reaction system. However, some researches {{point out that the}} influence of the reaction piles on the measured load-settlement relation may not be neglected, and that an analysis of the measured data is required to obtain a true load-settlement of the. From this point of view, the dynamic <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> or the rapid <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> may not be necessarily inferior to the static <b>load</b> <b>test,</b> considering cost and time performance of the dynamic <b>load</b> <b>test</b> as well. In this study, a new computer program for analysing the stress-wave propagation phenomena in pile driving was developed using a finite difference scheme and rational soil resistance models. Verification analyses of the proposed method are conducted first, and then the developed method is applied to the dynamic and static <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> on an end-bearing concrete pile...|$|R

40|$|Ultra-Large-Scale (ULS) systems face {{continuously}} evolving field workloads {{in terms}} of activated/disabled feature sets, varying usage patterns and changing deployment configura-tions. These evolving workloads often have a large impact {{on the performance of}} a ULS system. Hence, continuous <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> is critical to ensuring the error-free operation of such systems. A common challenge facing performance analysts is to validate if a <b>load</b> <b>test</b> closely resembles the current field workloads. Such validation may be performed by comparing execution logs from the <b>load</b> <b>test</b> and the field. However, the size and unstructured nature of execution logs makes such a comparison unfeasible without automated support. In this paper, we propose an automated approach to validate whether a <b>load</b> <b>test</b> resembles the field workload and, if not, determines how they differ by compare execution logs from a <b>load</b> <b>test</b> and the field. Performance analysts can then up-date their <b>load</b> <b>test</b> cases to eliminate such differences, hence creating more realistic <b>load</b> <b>test</b> cases.
