An appropriate legislation {{signed into law}} by President Vladimir Putin a year earlier, on December 26, 2012. Operators have repeatedly stated that the time allotted is not enough to run services. Within 12 days since the law came into force, 9090 <b>subscribers</b> <b>filed</b> applications to move to another operator, of which only 57 until satisfied.|$|R
5000|$|IMSI {{analysis}} {{is the process}} of examining a subscriber's IMSI to identify the network the IMSI belongs to, and whether subscribers from that network may use a given network (if they are not <b>local</b> <b>subscribers,</b> this requires a roaming agreement).|$|R
50|$|Use of 555- for {{anything}} other than 555-1212 style information numbers raises the problem that call cost is unclear to consumers; in theory, the numbers could be anything from toll-free to premium. This complicates the provision of toll restriction to <b>local</b> <b>subscribers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The same rule {{applies to}} mobile phone numbers, with the {{addition}} of the mobile prefix 15 {{right in front of the}} <b>local</b> <b>subscriber's</b> number. Using the same example above, to reach a Ushuaia mobile from Córdoba, one should dial: 0 + 2901 + 15 + xx-xxxx ...|$|R
50|$|Newly {{assigned}} numbers have {{a length of}} eight digits for the <b>local</b> <b>subscriber</b> number, yielding a total length of ten digits (not including the 0 trunk code). This is shorter than the maximum of eleven digits in other areas {{in order to avoid}} local numbers to be longer than eight digits.|$|R
50|$|Length of {{geographical}} area codes (A) is usually 3 to 5 digits; length of non-geographical area codes is 3. The groups of digits in the <b>local</b> <b>subscriber's</b> number (B) {{are separated by}} dashes ('-'): BBB-BB-BB, BB-BB-BB, B-BB-BB.

50|$|On August 8, a {{group of}} Time Warner Cable <b>subscribers</b> <b>filed</b> a class action lawsuit against the {{provider}} in a Wisconsin District Court under grounds of breach of contract. Journal Broadcast Group claimed on its website that TWC was distracted due to its dispute with CBS Corporation (which resulted in the removals of CBS Television Stations outlets in select markets and the Showtime Networks premium channel suite nationwide, until it signed a new agreement on September 2, 2013). Journal also asked state authorities {{to intervene in the}} dispute.|$|R
50|$|Calling inter-area (within Australia) (e.g. from Western Australia—area code 8), {{a caller}} need not dial an {{international}} trunk prefix or a country code. However, the caller must at least dial the Australian trunk prefix (0) {{followed by the}} area code (7) and then the <b>local</b> <b>subscriber</b> number: 07 3333 3333. Calling from within the Queensland (7) area, a caller need only dial the telephone number: 3333 3333.|$|R
50|$|Commercial {{broadcasting}} {{overlaps with}} paid {{services such as}} cable television, radio and satellite television. Such services are generally partially or wholly paid for by <b>local</b> <b>subscribers</b> and is known as leased access. Other programming (particularly on cable television) is produced by companies operating {{in much the same}} manner as advertising-funded commercial broadcasters, and they (and often the local cable provider) sell commercial time in a similar manner.|$|R
50|$|A caller {{from outside}} Australia must dial the {{international}} call prefix of the originating country, plus the country calling code (61 {{in the case}} of Australia), plus the area code (7 in this case), and then the <b>local</b> <b>subscriber</b> number. Therefore a caller in the U.K. must dial 00 61 7 3333 3333, while a caller in the U.S.A. must dial 011 61 7 3333 3333.|$|R
50|$|Originally, the FX {{line was}} a {{physical}} copper pair of telephone wires from the foreign exchange which {{were connected to}} the <b>local</b> <b>subscriber</b> loop at the local exchange, without passing through the local switch. This dedicated circuit is now often replaced with a virtual equivalent, where the local switch sends the FX calls to the foreign exchange (which handles all billing) on existing trunks.|$|R
5000|$|Sidewalk.com {{was first}} {{registered}} in 1995 by a C.D. Bell of Los Angeles, CA, as a website where <b>local</b> <b>subscribers</b> could gain a {{presence on the}} web.

5000|$|... 1976 {{also saw}} the {{introduction}} of International Subscriber Dialling (ISD) enabling <b>local</b> <b>subscribers</b> to dial direct to over 250 million telephones in 26 countries. However, ISD was not available from coin boxes until July 1982 when POA boxes were replaced with Post Office CT22B type electronic payphones. In 1979 the Board introduced a Motorola single channel radio paging system, which was upgraded to a two channel system. It is now operated by the Jersey Airport Department of Electronics.|$|R

5000|$|As of January 2016 Airtel Africa {{operates}} in 17 African countries. Marketed as [...] "One Network" [...] airtel {{was the first}} telecom company in Africa to provide a border less solution for its customer across the continent. With this service airtel customer can freely roam in other airtel operating countries and use their phone as a <b>local</b> <b>subscriber.</b> This service has been extended to India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka where airtel Africa users {{would not have to}} change their sim cards to operate freely in the three Asian nations.|$|R
50|$|Concentrators {{are often}} placed {{alongside}} a {{digital subscriber line}} access multiplexer (DSLAM). This can provide access to asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) Internet service for subscribers who are beyond the normal 4 km signaling limit on a copper wire loop. For example, a fiber optic cable might run up to 30 km without a repeater from the telephone exchange to a concentrator site, and <b>local</b> <b>subscriber</b> wire <b>local</b> loops can extend an additional 4 km beyond the concentrator and its DSLAM. With repeaters in the fiber optic cable {{the distance from the}} telephone exchange can be extended much farther.|$|R
50|$|V5 is {{a family}} of {{telephone}} network protocols defined by ETSI which allow communications between the telephone exchange, also known in the specifications as the local exchange (LE), and the local loop. With potentially thousands of subscribers connected to the LE there {{is the problem of}} physically managing thousands of wires out to the <b>local</b> <b>subscribers</b> (and the costs associated with that). Prior to the specification of V5 the manufacturers of exchange equipment had proprietary solutions to the problem. These solutions did not inter-operate and meant being tied into a single manufacturer's method at each exchange.|$|R
50|$|With {{the advent}} of {{sophisticated}} electronics {{in the early part}} of the 1990s, telephone service providers developed methods to share a single copper line to transmit multiple telephone calls simultaneously. Various pair gain methods using time-division multiplexing and frequency-division multiplexing prevented interference between simultaneous calls. A distant suburb may have a subscriber loop carrier or digital loop carrier system in which a remote concentrator is located near the subscribers to connect multiple <b>local</b> <b>subscriber</b> loops to one common line to a central office exchange. A single optical fibre can also be shared between multiple subscribers in fibre to the cabinet systems.|$|R

The launched power into SMF was- 22. 5 dBm and- 19. 2 dBm for the 1300 nm and 1500 nm channel respectively. Chromatic dispersion penalty for the 1500 nm channel at 560 Mb /s was about 6. 5 dB and the electrical crosstalk penalty between channels was 2. 5 dB. The experiment demonstrated enhanced channel capacity and {{the feasibility of}} a <b>local</b> <b>subscriber</b> loop network without employing active light source at the customer premises...|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} the use of push-buttons in {{telephony}} originated around 1887 with a device called the micro-telephone push-button, but it was not an automatic dialing system as understood later. This use even predated the invention of the rotary dial by Almon Brown Strowger in 1891. The Bell System in the United States relied on manual switched service until 1919, when it reversed its decisions and embraced dialed, automatic switching. The 1951 introduction of direct distance dialing required automatic transmission of dialed numbers between distant exchanges, leading to use of inband multi-frequency signaling within the Long Lines network while individual <b>local</b> <b>subscribers</b> continued to dial using standard pulses.|$|R

50|$|In May 1988, {{a central}} office {{fire in the}} Chicago suburb of Hinsdale, Illinois knocked out 35,000 <b>local</b> <b>subscribers,</b> broke {{the link between the}} FAA and air traffic control at Chicago O'Hare International Airport (then the world's busiest) and {{disrupted}} the Midwest's ability to communicate {{with the rest of the}} country. The office had a fire alarm but no automatic fire suppression equipment. The facility was unattended and monitored remotely by an Illinois Bell technician in Springfield; it took an hour to notify firefighters of the blaze as the distant technician's attempts to call the fire department in Hinsdale did not get through. The fire had already knocked out the phone lines.|$|R
50|$|Subscription {{libraries}} were democratic in nature; {{created by}} and for communities of <b>local</b> <b>subscribers</b> who aimed to establish permanent collections of books and reading materials, rather than selling their collections annually as the circulating libraries tended to do, {{in order to raise}} funds to support their other commercial interests. Even though the subscription libraries were often founded by reading societies, committees, elected by the subscribers, chose books for the collection that were general, rather than aimed at a particular religious, political or professional group. The books selected for the collection were chosen because they would be mutually beneficial to the shareholders. The committee also selected the librarians who would manage the circulation of materials.|$|R
