5|$|Although the Act {{was largely}} ineffective, {{it has been}} seen as the first piece of Health & Safety legislation, leading the way to {{subsequent}} regulations covering industrial workplaces; its requirement for factory walls to be whitewashed continued to be a <b>legal</b> <b>requirement</b> until the Factories Act 1961.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Laws and {{regulations}} play {{an increasingly important}} role for requirements engineering and system development. The challenge of interpreting the law to elicit <b>legal</b> <b>requirements</b> for a novel application calls for legal expertise. In this paper, we investigate if the effort of compiling a list of <b>legal</b> software <b>requirements</b> can be reduced by reusing recurring <b>legal</b> <b>requirements.</b> Therefore, we collected <b>legal</b> <b>requirements</b> that are stable concerning changes due to their origin in fundamental, higher-ranked laws, and derived software requirement patterns from them. This paper contributes by presenting those software requirement patterns consisting of the name, the goal and the pre-defined requirement template. We argue that under certain circumstances {{they can be used}} as a lightweight approach to specify <b>legal</b> <b>requirements</b> in system development projects and hence reduce the need for legal advice...|$|R

40|$|Using {{models for}} expressing <b>legal</b> <b>requirements</b> is now commonplace in Requirements Engineering. Models of <b>legal</b> <b>requirements,</b> {{on the one}} hand, {{facilitate}} communication between software engineers and legal experts, {{and on the other}} hand, provide a basis for systematic and automated analysis. The most prevalent application of <b>legal</b> <b>requirements</b> models is for checking the compliance of software systems with laws and regulations. In this experience paper, we explore a complementary application of <b>legal</b> <b>requirements</b> models, namely simulation. We observe that, in domains such as taxation, the same models that underlie legal compliance analysis bring important added value by enabling simulation. Concretely, this paper reports on the model-based simulation of selected <b>legal</b> <b>requirements</b> (policies) derived from Luxembourg’s Income Tax Law. The simulation scenario considered in the paper is aimed at analyzing the impact of a current tax law reform proposal in Luxembourg. We describe our approach for simulation along with empirical results demonstrating the feasibility and accuracy of the approach. We further present lessons learned from the experience...|$|R

5|$|The report {{made several}} recommendations, {{including}} {{the creation of}} a set of national principles emphasizing the minimum use of force at all times, and making the display of police ID a <b>legal</b> <b>requirement.</b> In February 2010 the Met announced that 8,000 of its officers had been issued with embroidered epaulettes, as several had complained that the numbers were falling off, rather than being removed deliberately.|$|E
5|$|A {{tower was}} {{built out of}} {{the remains of the}} roof, similar to one that had existed at Claremont Road, and a system of defences and {{blockades}} were built. A core of around 30 protesters ensured that there were always people staying there (a <b>legal</b> <b>requirement</b> for a squatted home, as well as a defence against eviction). They were finally evicted on 21 June 1995, whereupon, as at Claremont Road, the building was immediately demolished. The total cost of removing the protesters from Munstonia was given to be £239,349.52, not including additional costs of security guards.|$|E

5|$|In response, the House of Commons {{prepared}} {{a set of}} four Resolutions, decrying these actions and restating the validity of Magna Carta and the <b>legal</b> <b>requirement</b> of habeas corpus. These were rejected by Charles, who also announced that Parliament would be dissolved; in response, the Commons met on 6 May to discuss alternatives, and concluded that a petition of right was the way forward. Accordingly, a committee under Sir Edward Coke drafted such a petition, and it {{was passed by the}} Commons on 8 May and sent to the House of Lords. After three weeks of debates and conferences between the two chambers, the Petition of Right was ratified by both houses on the 26th and 27 May. Following additional debates in which the King restricted the right of the Commons to freely speak, he bowed to the pressure; in need of Parliamentary support for the war effort, the Petition was accepted on 2 June. Unhappy with the method chosen, both houses joined together and demanded the King fully ratify the Petition, which he did on 7 June.|$|E
5|$|Pakistan, {{attempting}} {{to force the}} issue of Kashmir's accession, cut off supplies and transport links. The chaos in Punjab resulting from Partition had also severed transport links with India, meaning that Kashmir's only links with the two dominions was by air. Rumours about atrocities against the Muslim population of Poonch by the Maharajah's forces caused the outbreak of civil unrest. Shortly thereafter, Pathan tribesmen from the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan crossed the border and entered Kashmir. The invaders made rapid progress towards Srinagar. The Maharaja of Kashmir wrote to India, asking for military assistance. India required the signing of an Instrument of Accession and setting up an interim government headed by Sheikh Abdullah in return. The Maharaja complied, but Nehru declared {{that it would have}} to be confirmed by a plebiscite, although there was no <b>legal</b> <b>requirement</b> to seek such confirmation.|$|E
5|$|The 1902 Education Act {{also made}} it a <b>legal</b> <b>requirement</b> for the County Council to provide an equal {{educational}} opportunity for girls. A conference was held in October 1903 to discuss the founding of a girls' school, and by January 1905 Wisbech High School for Girls was established in Harecroft House on the North Brink. The house had been donated on a long-term lease for the purpose by the Peckover family. Harecroft House had been built in 1844 by Algernon Peckover, and his descendants {{lived in the house}} until the death of Susannah Peckover in 1903, after which it was left vacant. The first headmistress was Beatrice Sparks, who was the first woman to complete the Oxford Tripos in mathematics. New schoolrooms were added to the High School in 1906, 1913, 1922 and 1936, when a mixed-use gymnasium and hall was constructed. This hall was, until recently, used as the school dining room and will from 2017 be the school's library. Originally, the High School was also able to take boarders, which continued until after World War II.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To study health, health care, and <b>legal</b> <b>requirements</b> as {{reflected}} in predefined headings that were applied by users in a Swedish multi-professional electronic health record (EHR). Method: Predefined headings (n = 3 596) applied to 20 398 104 occasions by health care professionals in a module for care documentation in an EHR were analysed. A qualitative content {{analysis was used to}} explore health and health care {{as reflected}} in the predefined headings. Furthermore, a comparison was made between the health and health care aspects and the Swedish Patient Data Act (PDA) to examine whether the aspects corresponded to <b>legal</b> <b>requirements.</b> Results: The analysis yielded a meaningful structure that included five categories and 23 subcategories. The categories were Description of the patient, Health care process, Resources employed, Administrative documentation, and Development and research. Of the 23 subcategories, 15 corresponded to four of the seven <b>legal</b> <b>requirements</b> in the PDA. No corresponding subcategories were observed for three of the <b>legal</b> <b>requirements.</b> Conclusions: The predefined headings of the multi-professional EHR were possible to analyse and categorise. The analysis showed that the headings reflected a wide range of health and health care and that synonyms or similar terms occurred as headings. The majority of the subcategories corresponded to the <b>legal</b> <b>requirements</b> of the PDA. The <b>legal</b> <b>requirements</b> that referred to patient rights did not have any corresponding subcategory. Subcategories that were found and that concerned goals to be attained and intervention outcomes were not explicitly expressed as <b>legal</b> <b>requirements</b> in the PDA...|$|R
40|$|IT {{outsourcing}} to clouds bears {{new challenges}} to the technical implementation of legally compliant clouds. On the one hand, outsourcing companies have to comply with <b>legal</b> <b>requirements.</b> On the other hand, cloud providers have to support their customers in achieving compliance with these <b>legal</b> <b>requirements</b> when processing data in the cloud. Consequently, the questions arise when IT outsourcing to clouds is lawful, which <b>legal</b> <b>requirements</b> apply to data processing in clouds, and how cloud providers can support their customers on achieving legal compliance. In this thesis, {{answers to these questions}} are given by performing a legal analysis identifying the <b>legal</b> <b>requirements</b> and a technical analysis identifying how <b>legal</b> <b>requirements</b> can be addressed in the context of cloud computing. Further, an information flow analysis is done, resulting in a system theoretical model that is able to describe information flow control in clouds based on the security classification of virtual resources and hardware resources. In a proof-of-concept implementation which is based on the OpenStack open-source cloud platform, it is shown that information flow control can be implemented as a part of cloud management and that legal compliance can be monitored and reported based on the actual assignment of virtual resources to hardware resources. Thereby, cloud providers are able to provide cloud customers with cloud resources, which are automatically assigned to hardware resources that comply with the <b>legal</b> <b>requirements</b> of the cloud customers. This consequently empowers cloud customers to utilise cloud resources according to their <b>legal</b> <b>requirements</b> and to keep control of managing the legal compliance of their data processing in clouds...|$|R

5|$|Potential presidential {{candidates}} are vetted by an unelected three-member Presidential Elections Committee ("PEC"). The PEC is not constitutionally obliged to give reasons behind its decisions to award or deny {{a certificate of}} eligibility. Its decision {{is not subject to}} legal or political scrutiny, and its verdict is final. There has been criticism of how Andrew Kuan, who applied to be a candidate in the 2005 presidential election, was denied a certificate of eligibility. Before the PEC could reach a decision on the matter, he was reportedly discredited though statements from various people which were published in the media that alleged incompetence and cast doubt on his character. Subsequently, Kuan was denied a certificate, the PEC stating that his seniority and responsibility as the Jurong Town Corporation's Group Chief Financial Officer were not comparable to the experience of a chairman or chief executive officer of a statutory board or a company with a paid-up capital of at least $100 million, as required by the Constitution. There is no <b>legal</b> <b>requirement</b> for the PEC to interview prospective candidates, and it did not do so to allow Kuan to explain his side of the story. As a result, the unopposed incumbent S.R. Nathan was declared the President for a second term.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Holden {{introduced}} the VK Commodore, with significant styling changes {{from the previous}} VH. The Commodore was next updated in 1986 as the VL, which had new front and rear styling. Controversially, the VL was powered by the 3.0-litre Nissan RB30 six-cylinder engine and had a Nissan-built, electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission. Holden even went to court in 1984 to stop local motoring magazine Wheels from reporting on the matter. The engine change was necessitated by the <b>legal</b> <b>requirement</b> that all new cars sold in Australia after 1986 had to consume unleaded petrol. Because it was unfeasible to convert the existing six-cylinder engine to run on unleaded fuel, the Nissan engine {{was chosen as the}} best engine available. However, changing exchange rates doubled the cost of the engine and transmission {{over the life of the}} VL. The decision to opt for a Japanese-made transmission led to the closure of the Woodville, South Australia assembly plant. Confident by the apparent sign of turnaround, GM paid off Holden's mounted losses of A$780million on 19 December 1986. At GM headquarters' request, Holden was then reorganised and recapitalised, separating the engine and car manufacturing divisions in the process. This involved the splitting of Holden into Holden's Motor Company (HMC) and Holden's Engine Company (HEC). For the most part, car bodies were now manufactured at Elizabeth, South Australia, with engines as before, confined to the Fishermans Bend plant in Port Melbourne, Victoria. The engine manufacturing business was successful, building four-cylinder Family II engines for use in cars built overseas. The final phase of the Commodore's recovery strategy involved the 1988 VN, a significantly wider model powered by the American-designed, Australian-assembled 3.8-litre Buick V6 engine.|$|E
