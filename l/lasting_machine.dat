25|$|Jan Ernst Matzeliger (September 15, 1852 – August 24, 1889) was {{a revolutionary}} in the shoe {{industry}} with {{the invention of}} the <b>lasting</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In February 1899, the 3 major US shoe {{machinery}} companies,Goodyear Machinery Company, Consolidated Hand <b>Lasting</b> <b>Machine</b> Company and McKay Shoe Machinery Company merged to form United Shoe Machinery (USM). Pearson and Bennion's managing director, Charles Bennion went to Boston {{to negotiate}} a merger with USM and the company which would eventually become BUSM (British United Shoe Machinery) was incorporated in October 1899 with the Union Works factory as its headquarters. [...] The 1st years accounts dated 31 May 1900, showed 200 employees, profits of £16500 and £300,000 capital.A further 10 acre of land was purchased in 1901 from the Belgrave Road Cricket and Bicycle Grounds, the former home of both Leicester Fosse FC and Leicester Tigers.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{describes}} three {{applications of}} industrial robot in shoe production. Two of them – automation of shoe <b>lasting</b> <b>machine</b> and automation of finishing process are {{extremely difficult to}} automate and are according to our knowledge first successful automation of the above processes. The focus of the paper is on automatic robot trajectory generation directly from CAD shoe design data. The paper shows also how kinematic redundancy resolution approach was used in order to design fault tolerant robot trajectories...|$|E

40|$|Jan Ernst Matzeliger, a shoemaker, {{was born}} in Paramaribo, Dutch Guiana, {{the son of a}} Negro woman and a Dutch engineer, in whose machine shop he began working at the age of ten. Although he could speak little English, young Jan earned his passage to the United States as a sailor. He found work in Philadelphia and later moved to Lynn, Massachusetts, where he learned shoemaking, a trade in which he worked for the {{remainder}} of his life. Before he died, he invented the <b>lasting</b> <b>machine,</b> which revolutionized the manufacture of shoes and helped make Lynn the shoe capital of the world. Mechanization of shoemaking had been applied to the cutting and stitching of leather, but the final problem of shaping and attaching the upper portion of the shoe to the leather sole still remained. This slow, tedious task, which was done by the shoemakers working by hand, produced a bottleneck: the men could not finish a shoe as rapidly as a machine produced its parts. Matzeliger recognized the problem as he worked at his bench, stretching, shaping, and attaching each shoe to its sole. In secret, he experimented with a crude wooden machine, and then with an iron model, on which he worked for ten years until he perfected it. He sent his diagrams to Washington D. C. for a patent and on March 20, 1883, received his grant for the “lasting machine. ” He had invented a machine which held the shoe on the last, gripped and pulled the leather down around the heel, set and drove in the nails, and then discharged the completed shoe.

50|$|The {{range of}} models {{was reduced to}} just two machines, the ‘Mk.3 Interstate’ and the ‘Roadster’. The {{specification}} remained unchanged until October 1977 when the <b>last</b> <b>machines</b> were made, although few Roadsters {{were made in the}} end due to the higher cash sales value of the Interstate.|$|R
30|$|Each {{work center}} {{consists}} of one machine. Each part enters {{from the first}} machine, passes in order from all machines and the intermediate buffers, and exits the line from the <b>last</b> <b>machine.</b> The machines are considered unreliable. The processing times of the work centers are the same {{in order to obtain}} a balanced production line (Nahas (2017) considered only the production rate of the production line). The processing times assure the production rate required.|$|R

The Deutsche Reichsbahn in East Germany held onto these {{locomotives}} for longer and converted 13 examples to coal-dust firing. Locomotive number 17 1119 {{was given a}} condensing tender. In 1963 the <b>last</b> <b>machines</b> were taken out of service by the DR.|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} {{began in}} central Norrköping during the 15th century. Since expansion was hindered {{by lack of}} area the production moved outside Norrköping to Bråviken.

50|$|The UT4 model, {{with its}} 15,380 litre engine (260 x 290 mm stroke) was {{probably}} the largest single cylinder hothead tractor ever built. The UT6, built as a smaller version of the UT4, became the basis, in 1936, for the C35 a crawler tractor. This {{was to be the}} <b>last</b> <b>machine</b> designed by Ulisse who, that year, left the company with his father Federico.|$|R
50|$|It also {{manufactured}} some of {{the earliest}} computers, the most famous of which, the PB 250 released in 1961, {{was one of the last}} users of magnetostrictive delay lines as part of its memory. It was also the <b>last</b> <b>machine</b> to be partially based on the original designs of Alan Turing’s NPL Pilot ACE computer. In the 1960s, Packard Bell was also in the defense electronics business.|$|R
50|$|Nine {{examples}} of the class have been scrapped to date: no 401 was broken up in 1975 after an accident, and six others followed after the delivery of the second series of the Ge 4/4 II in 1984. As the <b>last</b> <b>machines</b> to disappear for the time being, no. 413 and 412 were used in 1996 and 2008 respectively as spare parts donors, and then scrapped.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{manufacturing}} precision of the shoe <b>last</b> <b>machine,</b> a new error-computing model has been put forward to. At first, Based on the special topological structure of the shoe <b>last</b> <b>machine</b> and multi-rigid body system theory, a spatial error-calculating model of the system was built; Then, the law of error distributing in the whole work space was discussed, and the maximum error position of the system was found; At last, The sensitivities of error parameters were analyzed at the maximum position and the accuracy synthesis was conducted by using Monte Carlo method. Considering the error sensitivities analysis, {{the accuracy of the}} main parts was distributed. Results show that the probability of the maximal volume error less than 0. 05 mm of the new scheme was improved from 0. 6592 to 0. 7021 than the probability of the old scheme, the precision of the system was improved obviously, the model can be used for the error analysis and accuracy synthesis of the complex multi- embranchment motion chain system, and to improve the system precision of manufacturing. ...|$|R

5|$|Wilson {{initiated}} {{the construction of}} a 1.4 GeV synchrotron in 1952. As he had foreseen in 1948, it produced artificial K mesons and rho mesons, and tested quantum electrodynamics at short distances. The <b>last</b> <b>machine</b> he built at Cornell was a 12 GeV synchrotron that remains in use as an injector for the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR), built between 1977 and 1999. It is located in what is now known as the Wilson Synchrotron Laboratory.|$|R
