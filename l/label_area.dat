25|$|When auto-changing {{turntables}} were commonplace, {{records were}} typically pressed with a raised (or ridged) outer edge and a raised <b>label</b> <b>area,</b> allowing records to be stacked onto each other without the delicate grooves coming into contact, {{reducing the risk}} of damage. Auto-changers included a mechanism to support a stack of several records above the turntable itself, dropping them one at a time onto the active turntable to be played in order. Many longer sound recordings, such as complete operas, were interleaved across several 10-inch or 12-inch discs for use with auto-changing mechanisms, so that the first disk of a three-disk recording would carry sides 1 and 6 of the program, while the second disk would carry sides 2 and 5, and the third, sides 3 and 4, allowing sides 1, 2, and 3 to be played automatically; then the whole stack reversed to play sides 4, 5, and 6.|$|E

50|$|Most {{records have}} a locked groove {{at the end}} of each side or {{individual}} band.

Kosmic members Maelcum & IQ placed second in the music competition with [...] "Hitchhiking Reticulan".

50|$|With {{the advent}} of long-playing records, the album cover became more than just {{packaging}} and protection, and album cover art became {{an important part of}} the music marketing and consuming experience. In the 1970s it became more common to have picture covers on singles. Many singles with picture sleeves (especially from the 1960s) are sought out by collectors, and the sleeves alone can go for a high price. LPs can have embossed cover art (with some sections being raised), an effect rarely seen on CD covers. The <b>label</b> <b>area</b> on the disc itself may contain themed or custom artwork rather than the standard record company's logo layout.|$|E

5000|$|Documenting {{the output}} of American Berliner has proved a {{daunting}} task, as original records are scarce collector's items and the company employed a system of block numbering that seems to make little sense. Although referred to commonly as [...] "Berliner matrices", they are not true matrix numbers, but catalog numbers concerned with preserving the same number for each selection even if a given title was re-recorded by another artist. Subsequent re-recordings are usually given a letter suffix, usually [...] "W-Z" [...] for early releases. Helpfully, the recording or matrix processing date is usually inscribed in the <b>label</b> <b>area,</b> but as Berliner did not employ paper labels sometimes the information is difficult to read. A simple new more or less sequential numbering system was started in March 1899, in which every number had a leading zero (never used previously) and the letter suffix, when present, denoted the category, e.g., [...] "A" [...] for marching band, [...] "F" [...] for banjo, [...] "N" [...] for vocal quartet. Berliner's foreign matrices employed entirely different strategies, and many to most of those have been documented by discographer Alan Kelly.|$|E

5000|$|For LabelTag the Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation (EFM+) channel code {{properties}} are modulated {{to create the}} visual label. In the EFM+ code table, the user data bytes are transformed into specific sequences of pits and lands, ranging from 3T up to 14T channel bits. To create a pit, a high power pulse from the laser is focused into a small spot on the dye layer. This heats the dye material such that an irreversible transformation of the dye material creates the pit. To create a land, the laser is turned to a low power, such that no transformation in the dye material occurs. In general for DVD+/-R media, the recorded marks have a different visual reflection. Therefore, by recording long sequences of reflective marks or reflective spaces one can create the visible label. To maintain maximum backwards compatibility, LabelTag uses a majority of long marks in the recording layer for a dark pixel, while the bright image pixels are created {{by a majority of}} long spaces in the recording layer. Only in that case a sufficient large Differential Phase Detection (DPD) tracking signal is generated. This DPD signal is required for DVD players to jump over the <b>Label</b> <b>area</b> to reach beyond the label appended user data.|$|E
5000|$|The {{resultant}} Folkways anthology, {{issued in}} 1952 {{under the title}} American Folk Music, was a compilation of recordings of folk music issued on hillbilly and race records {{that had previously been}} released commercially on 78 rpm. These dated from the abbreviated dawn, sometimes called the [...] "golden age", of the commercial country music industry, that is, between 1927, when, as Smith explained, [...] "acoustic recording [...] made possible accurate music reproduction, and 1932, when the Depression halted folk music sales", and the artists, in many cases, sunk into obscurity. Originally issued as budget discs marketed to regional, rural audiences, these records had long been known, collected, and occasionally reissued by folklorists and aficionados, {{but this was the first}} time such a large compilation was made available to affluent, non-specialist urban dwellers. LP discs could hold much more material than the old three-minute 78s, and had greater fidelity and far less surface noise. The Anthology was packaged as a set of three, boxed albums with a total of 6 LPs. Each box front a different color: red, blue, and green - in Smith's schema, representing the alchemical elements. Priced at $25.00 per two-disc set, they were relatively expensive. For the money-challenged, Moe Asch maintained a retail record store in the 1950s near Union Square Park where he sold all 6 of the Anthology records for $1 each, as well as others from his catalogue. The $1 records were sold without their original jackets, and with a hole punched through the <b>label</b> <b>area</b> to indicate that the record was remaindered and not to be sold for the full retail price. A fourth album, comprising topical songs from the Depression era, was originally planned by Asch and his long-time assistant, Marian Distler, and never completed by Smith. It was issued in 2000, nine years after his death in CD format by Revenant Records with a 95-page booklet of tribute essays to Smith.|$|E
5000|$|Although once {{produced}} {{in a wide}} range of sizes (from less than 7 in to more than 16 in in diameter) and sometimes with glass core discs, the examples most commonly encountered today are 10 , 12 or 14 in in diameter and consist of an aluminium core disc coated with black nitrocellulose lacquer, commonly but incorrectly called [...] "acetate". The term [...] "acetate" [...] derives from the material used in examples cut before 1934, when the substrate was in fact cellulose acetate. Cellulose acetate was only in use for a short while, but the name [...] "acetate" [...] for these discs persisted. Blank discs were traditionally {{produced in}} several different grades, with the best and costliest grade featuring the sturdiest core, the thickest coating and the most perfectly flawless mirror-like surfaces. These top-quality blanks were intended for cutting the master discs that, once silver-coated, would be electrodeposited with nickel in order to electroform parts used in making stampers (negative profile metal moulds) for pressing ordinary records. Lower-quality blanks were considered adequate for non-critical uses such as tests and demo discs. Lower-grade blanks were formerly made for home use by amateurs and may be very thin and flexible, may have a cardboard rather than a metal or glass base, and may have noticeably dull or slightly orange-peel-textured surfaces. In addition to the usual central spindle hole, there is traditionally at least one drive hole in the <b>label</b> <b>area,</b> meant to be engaged by a special pin that prevents the disc from slipping on the turntable during the recording process if the lathe does not have a vacuum turntable. Drive holes are often hidden by labels applied after the recording was cut, but they can usually be detected by careful inspection of the label or by holding the disc up to a light bright enough to penetrate the labels. Drive holes are no longer standard on lacquer masters, only on [...] "dubs", because the additional holes can interfere with the electroforming process and professional mastering lathes use vacuum turntables that hold the workpiece (lacquer disc) in place with suction. One pump usually provides suction for both the turntable and the chip tube that pulls away the fine string of nitrocellulose lacquer removed by the groove-cutting stylus.|$|E
