5|$|During battle sequences, {{the game}} uses the Dual Raid <b>Linear</b> <b>Motion</b> Battle System, a {{variation}} of the <b>Linear</b> <b>Motion</b> Battle used in the Tales series. Four characters from the party are chosen to battle and characters not controlled by a player are controlled by artificial intelligence with instructions set by the players beforehand. The enemy mob's number, appearances, behavior, vary and are dependent on the mob's avatar. Both sides' objective is to deplete the other side's health points (HP) using attacks and skills. When a party member's health falls to zero, the party member faints until revived with items, by a healer, or resting at an inn on the field map; Mobs with zero HP disappear from the arena. Killing all the mobs will yield experience points, items, and allows the player to return to the field map. If all four participating party members are defeated, a game over will occur. Skill and attribute development is based on a system of orbs placed on the nodes of a hexagonal web called the Lilium Orb. When characters level up, they receive GP which can then be allocated to the orbs on the web in a uni-linear path. Each orb activated contains either a new skill or an attribute upgrade.|$|E
5|$|The Tales {{series is}} {{classified}} as a role-playing video game series. Multiple gameplay elements carry over from entry to entry. The main unifying element is the combat system, the <b>Linear</b> <b>Motion</b> Battle System (LMBS for short).

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) for {{curvilinear}} motions in an interacting multiple model (IMM) algorithm {{to track}} a maneuvering vehicle {{on a road}} is investigated. Driving patterns of vehicles on a road are modeled as stochastic hybrid systems. In order to track the maneuvering vehicles, two kinematic models are derived: A constant velocity model for <b>linear</b> <b>motions</b> and a constant-speed turn model for curvilinear motions. For the constant-speed turn model, an UKF is used because of the drawbacks of the extended Kalman filter in nonlinear systems. The suggested algorithm reduces the root mean squares error for <b>linear</b> <b>motions</b> and rapidly detects possible turning motions...|$|R
5|$|The story, set {{eighteen}} years after Destiny, follows Kyle Dunamis, {{the son of}} the previous game's protagonists Stahn Aileron and Rutee Katrea. Shortly after meeting a mysterious girl named Reala while trying to save Rutee's orphanage from bankruptcy, Kyle is drawn into conflict with Barbatos, a cruel warrior responsible for killing Stahn, and the machinations of Elraine, a religious leader seeking to bring peace to mankind. The gameplay uses two-dimensional character sprites and backgrounds, and the battle system is a revamped version of the series' trademark <b>Linear</b> <b>Motion</b> Battle System.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} Tales games, it features an action-based battle system, called the Three-Line <b>Linear</b> <b>Motion</b> Battle System. The game {{was developed by}} the 2D Tales development unit Team Destiny. The characters were designed by Mutsumi Inomata, who had previously worked on Tales of Destiny. The scenario, written by Hiramatsu Masaki, dealt extensively with issues of coexistence between races and ethnic conflicts. The game has received positive reviews and strong sales in Japan, with the PlayStation 2 version eventually selling over 600,000 units and the PSP re-release selling over 83,000. Western sites have been positive about the game, though neither version of the game have received English localizations.|$|E
5|$|When the {{right-hand}} side of the equation is a positive real number, the solution corresponds to an epispiral. When the argument θ1 – θ0 equals ±90°×k, the cosine goes to zero and the radius goes to infinity. Thus, when k is less than one, the range of allowed angles becomes small and the force is repulsive (red curve on right in Figure7). On the other hand, when k is greater than one, the range of allowed angles increases, corresponding to an attractive force (green, cyan and blue curves on left in Figure7); the orbit of the particle can even wrap around the center several times. The possible values of the parameter k may range from zero to infinity, which corresponds to values of μ ranging from negative infinity up to the positive upper limit, L12/m. Thus, for all attractive inverse-cube forces (negative μ) there is a corresponding epispiral orbit, as for some repulsive ones (μ < L12/m), as illustrated in Figure 7. Stronger repulsive forces correspond to a faster <b>linear</b> <b>motion.</b>|$|E

Kinematic, kinetic and EMG data were evaluated and cross-correlated. Cross-correlation analysis revealed a high, positive, zero-phased correlation between anteroposterior {{motions of the}} centre of gravity (COG) and centre of pressure (COP), head and COG, and between <b>linear</b> <b>motions</b> of the shoulder and knee in both sagittal and frontal planes. There was a moderate, negative, zero-phased correlation between the anteroposterior motion of COP and ankle angular motion. Narrow stance width increased ankle angular motion, hip angular motion, mediolateral sway of the COG, and the correlation between <b>linear</b> <b>motions</b> of the shoulder and knee in the frontal plane. Correlations between COG and COP and <b>linear</b> <b>motions</b> of the shoulder and knee in the sagittal plane were decreased. The correlation between the hip angular sway in the sagittal and frontal planes was dependent on interaction between support and vision. Low, significant positive correlations with time lags of the maximum of cross-correlation of 250 - 300 ms {{were found between the}} EMG activity of the lateral gastrocnemius muscle and anteroposterior motions of the COG and COP during normal stance. Narrow stance width decreased both correlations whereas absence of vision increased the correlation with COP. Ankle mechanisms dominate during normal stance especially in the sagittal plane. Narrow stance width decreased the role of the ankle and increased the role of hip mechanisms in the sagittal plane, while in the frontal plane both increased. The modulation pattern of the lateral gastrocnemius muscle suggests a central program of control of the ankle joint stiffness working to predict the loading pattern...|$|R
25|$|Although {{the firm}} still served the textile industry, Murray began to {{consider}} how the design of steam engines could be improved. He wanted to make them simpler, lighter, and more compact. He also wanted the steam engine to be a self-contained unit that could readily be assembled on site with pre-determined accuracy. Many existing engines suffered from faulty assembly, which took much effort to correct. One problem that Murray faced was that James Pickard had already patented the crank and flywheel method of converting <b>linear</b> <b>motion</b> to circular motion. Murray ingeniously got round this difficulty by introducing a hypocycloidal gear. This consisted of a large fixed ring with internal teeth. Around the inside of this ring a smaller gear wheel, with half the outer one's diameter, would roll driven by the piston rod of the steam engine, which {{was attached to the}} gear's rim. As the piston rod moved backwards and forwards in a straight line, its <b>linear</b> <b>motion</b> would be converted into circular motion by the gear wheel. The gear wheel's bearing was attached to a crank on the flywheel shaft. When he used the hypocycloidal gear he was able to build engines that were more compact and lightweight than previous ones. However, Murray ceased to use this type of motion as soon as Pickard's patent expired.|$|E
25|$|Mature axon tracts {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to experience growth when mechanically stretched at the central portion of the axon cylinder. Such mechanical stretch was applied by a custom axon stretch-growth bioreactor composed of four main components: custom-designed axon expansion chamber, <b>linear</b> <b>motion</b> table, stepper motor and controller. The nerve tissue culture is placed within the expansion chamber with a port for gas exchange and a removable stretching frame, which is able to separate two groups of somas (neuron cell bodies) and thus stretch their axons. Collagen gel was used to promote the growth of larger stretch-grown axon tracts that were visible to the unaided eye. There are two reasons for the growth enhancement due to the collagen coating: 1) the culture became hydrophobic after the collagen dried, which permitted a denser concentration of neurons to grow, and 2) the collagen coating created an unobstructed coating across the two elongation substrates. Examination by scanning electron microscope and TEM {{showed no signs of}} axon thinning due to stretch, and the cytoskeleton appeared to be normal and intact. The stretch-grown axon tracts were cultured on a biocompatible membrane, which could be directly formed into a cylindrical structure for transplantation, eliminating the need to transfer axons to a scaffold after growth was complete. The stretch-grown axons were able to grow at an unprecedented rate of 1cm/day after only 8 days of acclimation, which is much greater than the 1mm/day maximal growth rate as measured for growth cone extension. The rate of 1mm/day is also the average transport speed for structural elements such as neurofilaments.|$|E
