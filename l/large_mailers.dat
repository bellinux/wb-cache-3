50|$|The move to Idaho was an {{advantageous}} one. From {{the humble}} beginning in 1874 {{when the first}} Signs of the Times was issued, with Elder James White editing the paper, setting the type, and printing the pages, and with his son as a delivery boy, the institution has grown to become the employer of over 250 workers at a plant larger than three football fields and generating an annual income of over $40 million. Pacific Press is the <b>largest</b> bulk <b>mailer</b> in Idaho.|$|R
40|$|The Information Revolution is placing severe strains on the {{traditional}} national post office. As the pace of commerce has quickened, private express services have arisen to provide more rapid and reliable delivery services than available from the post office. Telecommunications coupled with improved printing technologies allow <b>large</b> <b>mailers</b> to bypass the first stages of postal distribution. Email has become an increasingly viable substitute {{for all types of}} letters and invoices. Corporate websites routinely handle transactions that once required several postal exchanges. In the postal world, however, change is welcomed by few. The postal monopoly and government status have substantially insulated the post office from the larger world of commerce. Isolation has impeded the incremental changes that allow orderly transformation in most industries. Politically important groups oppose radical change. Armies of postal managers and employees fear (probably correctly) that postal modernization will mean fewer jobs and lower wages for them (although not necessarily for the sector as a whole). Citizens in rural districts believe (probably incorrectly) that adapting the post office to changing times will lead to relatively higher prices or poorer service in the countryside. Nonetheless, in the last decade a cautious European Union has pressed a reluctant postal sector to introduce significant reform. The Postal Directive of 1997, adopted after 10 years of study and debate, placed a ceiling on the scope of postal monopolies and required tighter and more objective regulation of "universal service providers", i. e., national post offices. In 2002, the maximum scope of services that could be reserved for the national post office was lowered again, and regulatory requirements were strengthened in 228 COMMUNICATIONS & STRATEGIES no. 56 small but significant respects.

Among them are aluminized shipping bags, food cart covers and medical bags. Radiant Technologies purchases component materials and assembles a barrier made of layers of aluminized foil. The packaging reflects outside heat away from the product inside the container.

5000|$|On December 5, 2011 the USPS {{announced}} it would close {{more than half of}} its mail processing centers, eliminate 28,000 jobs and reduce overnight delivery of First-Class Mail. This will close down 252 of its 461 processing centers. [...] (At peak mail volume in 2006, the USPS operated 673 facilities.) As of May 2012, the plan was to start the first round of consolidation in summer 2012, pause from September to December, and begin a second round in February 2014; 80% of first class mail would still be delivered overnight through the end of 2013. New delivery standards were issued in January 2015, and the majority of single-piece (not presorted) first-class mail is now being delivered in two days instead of one. <b>Large</b> commercial <b>mailers</b> can still have first-class mail delivered overnight if delivered directly to a processing center in the early morning, though as of 2014 this represented only 11% of first-class mail. Unsorted first-class mail will continued to be delivered anywhere in the contiguous United States within three days.|$|R
40|$|On-chip enzyme {{reactors}} {{are often}} used in medical/pharmaceutical analysis due to their inherent advantages, such as high sample throughput, low reagent consumption, stability, reproducibility and low cost. The present work describes a different application of such microreactors, namely, elimination of interfering ascorbate signals in glutamate monitoring using ascorbate oxidase modified silicon chip microreactors of different sizes (5. 3 and 0. 95 muL). Glutamate was monitored with a previously developed redox hydrogel integrated bienzyme electrode, based on coupled glutamate oxidase and horseradish peroxidase, inserted in a miniaturized flow cell operated at - 50 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl). The developed on-line analysis system was characterized with regard to dilution effects, detection limit, response time and interference ability using model solutions and real samples. Off-line in vivo glutamate measurements could be made by injecting rat brain microdialysate samples collected before and after KCl stimulation without any interference of ascorbate, I Within the studied flow rate range (2 - 25 muL/min), 1 mM and 200 muM ascorbate could he totally eliminated using the <b>larger</b> and the <b>mailer</b> microreactor, respectively...|$|R
5000|$|The {{second part}} {{begins with an}} image of [...] "the Novelist in passing his baton to the Historian has a happy smile." [...] This {{part of the book}} is much shorter and deals with the March on the Pentagon at <b>large,</b> beyond when <b>Mailer</b> was arrested and taken away. It begins with a {{discussion}} of the organization of both sides of the March. Groups are shown to organize which exact routes and which locations are to be used. The protestors and the government negotiates the minutia of the protests, with each side reluctant to give up the smallest ground. Finally, {{on the day of the}} March, Mailer goes into the tactics and tools used by each side. He details the violent acts done by the military, using first hand accounts to illustrate the gravity of the actions. At the end of the day, the final hour of the protest is recorded in detail. As the loudspeakers tell the protestors to disperse before midnight, the last stragglers refuse to board the buses. Mailer again ends this section with religious imagery, and the last section, The Metaphor Delivered, attempts to illustrate how Mailer feels about the war and the protests.|$|R
