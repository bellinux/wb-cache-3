40|$|The Finite Element Method (FEM) {{has been}} applied widely in solving many {{engineering}} problems. The FEM is an approximate method, which makes use of a spatial discretization and a weighted residual formulation {{to arrive at a}} system of matrix equations. The most common weighted residual formulation employed is the Galerkin method, in which the applied shape functions and weight functions are identical. However, the Galerkin method performs poorly in certain areas, e. g. contact problems when quadratic elements are used. One possible explanation of the difficulties is that the resulting nodal reaction forces are unevenly distributed between mid-nodes and corner nodes. The piece-wise <b>linear</b> <b>weight</b> functions are especially developed to resolve this problem present in the standard quadratic element. The method of applying the piece-wise <b>linear</b> <b>weight</b> functions belongs to the Petrov-Galerkin method, which is the general name of the weighted residual methods that apply different shape functions and weight functions. The piece-wise <b>linear</b> <b>weight</b> functions at present are applied to quadratic elements only, both in 2 D and in 3 D. These quadratic elements are divided into some subelements, which are 3 -node triangles in 2 D case and 4 -node tetrahedrons in 3 D case. The piece-wise <b>linear</b> <b>weight</b> function for a certain node in a element is linear in the subelements connecting to the node and is zero in all other subelements, from which the name piece-wise comes. The piece-wise <b>linear</b> <b>weight</b> functions guarantee C 0 -continuity both for inter-element variables and for intra-element variables and C 1 -continuity for intra-subelement variables. In derivation of the finite element formulations an extra procedure to assemble contributions from each subelement is necessary. A new finite element family based on the piece-wise <b>linear</b> <b>weight</b> functions has been developed. It consists of 7 elements, four 2 D elements: TRI 6, QUAD 8 TC, QUAD 8 C and QUAD 8 D and three 3 D elements: TETRA 10, TETRA 11 and BRICK 27. Detailed procedures on deriving the finite element formulations of these new elements are given in the appended papers. The stiffness matrices and mass matrices of these elements are unsymmetric due to application of different shape and weight functions. An unsymmetric solver and extra calculations are required. Large number of examples presented in the appended papers demonstrate the applicability of these new finite elements. Godkänd; 2004; 20061025 (haneit...|$|E

As {{part of an overall}} assessment of the high-temperature characteristics of this material system, cyclic oxidation behavior was studied at 1093 C and 1204 C. Initially, both sets of coupons exhibited parabolic oxidation kinetics. Later, monolithic MA 956 exhibited spallation and a <b>linear</b> <b>weight</b> loss, whereas the composite showed a <b>linear</b> <b>weight</b> gain without spallation. Weight loss of the monolithic MA 956 resulted from the linking of a multiplicity of randomly oriented and closely spaced surface cracks that facilitated ready spallation. By contrast, cracking of the composite's oxide layer was nonintersecting and aligned nominally parallel with the orientation of the subsurface reinforcing fibers. Oxidative lifetime of monolithic MA 956 was projected from the observed oxidation kinetics. Linear elastic, finite element continuum, and micromechanics analyses were performed on coupons of the monolithic and composite materials.

50|$|An {{adaptation}} of <b>Linear</b> <b>Weights</b> was {{put forward by}} Garrett Chiado in January 2016. He introduced a statistic called Contextual Pitch Type <b>Linear</b> <b>Weights</b> (cLWTS). Chiado, being unsatisfied with the inability of <b>Linear</b> <b>Weights</b> to give predictive value to pitching, sought a statistic that put pitches into context and provided {{an explanation for the}} correlation between pitch values and sequencing. What makes cLWTS different from traditional <b>linear</b> <b>weights</b> is that cLWTS recognizes that a particular pitch does not fully determine the outcome of that pitch. There are other factors that affect the outcome of a pitch which are unrelated {{to the quality of the}} pitch itself. Thus, cLWTS takes into account the entire context of what happens after the pitch is thrown and only acknowledge “the necessary weight of how much responsibility the pitcher truly deserves. When doing this, we also want to control for the externalities of the current game state and other environmental factors. Ultimately, cLWTS grades on a cumulative basis and on a per pitch basis for both pitchers and hitters, judging on the change in run expectancy for each pitch type.” The strength of this particular statistic lies in its predictive power. However, cLWTS is subject to much of the same limitations as the ERA metric due to the fact that cLWTS simply removes pitches that included one or more errors on the play. In other words, pitchers are being penalized for “fielding and throwing errors by their defenders.” Correcting this flaw in cLWTS is currently in progress.|$|R

40|$|Echo state {{networks}} are a recently developed type of recurrent neural network where the internal layer is fixed with random weights, {{and only the}} output layer is trained on specific data. Echo state {{networks are}} increasingly being used to process spatiotemporal data in real-world settings, including speech recognition, event detection, and robot control. A strength of echo state networks is the simple method used to train the output layer - typically a collection of <b>linear</b> readout <b>weights</b> found using a least squares approach. Although straightforward to train and having a low computational cost to use, this method may not yield acceptable accuracy performance on noisy data.
