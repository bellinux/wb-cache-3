30|$|The {{concept of}} {{employees}} subject <b>to</b> <b>social</b> insurance <b>contributions</b> (sozialversicherungspflichtig Beschäftigte) covers all employees incl. those undergoing vocational training who {{are subject to}} health, pension and long-term care insurance and/or to contributions pursuant to employment promotion law or for whom employers pay shares of contribution pursuant to employment promotion law. Conscripts performing compulsory military or community service are regarded as employees subject <b>to</b> <b>social</b> insurance <b>contributions</b> provided they were employed {{at the time they}} began their service, the employment relationship continues and they do not receive remuneration payments purely for the reason of performing that service.

30|$|Until 1999, {{marginal}} secondary employment with a regular {{working week}} of 15  h or less was exempt from <b>social</b> insurance <b>contributions.</b> This changed in 1999 : marginal secondary employment was completely <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> tax and <b>social</b> insurance <b>contributions.</b> Then, from 2003 on, marginal secondary employment besides a main job {{has become more}} appealing again, because no <b>social</b> insurance <b>contributions</b> are paid when the income does not exceed an income limit. This income limit currently amounts to 450  €.|$|R
30|$|Even if {{the data}} {{allow us to}} {{distinguish}} between full-time and part-time work, they do not contain information on hours worked. Consequently, although we include part-timers (those <b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>social</b> insurance) {{in the analysis of}} job durations, we are forced to exclude them from the analysis of wages, which implies the neglect of a considerable part of the female workforce. 11 In addition, we exclude “mini-jobs” and other part-time jobs with short hours or low earnings from our analyses. Mini-jobs are legally required to fall below a certain threshold (e.[*]g., 400  € in 2012) and are largely exempted from <b>social</b> security <b>contributions.</b> The growth of such jobs in recent years is certainly relevant to our research question (Jahn et al. 2012; Möller 2014). However, {{due to the lack of}} information on hours worked and because earnings from mini-jobs often constitute a type of extra income, these jobs are difficult to analyse without any information on the household context.|$|R
40|$|Demographic {{change is}} often related to matters that are {{addressed}} {{in the framework of}} the European social dialogue. In view of a changing pyramid, financing of social security systems is being gradually moved into the focus of public debate. Reduced periods of gainful employment further jeopardise this financing: {{more and more people are}} sent into early retirement, while young people find permanent employment (<b>liable</b> <b>to</b> <b>social</b> security payments) at everlater dates. Against this backdrop, our research project was aimed at analysing possibilities of a better integration of young and elder employees into the labour market by means of flexible working time models. Within this framework, best practice examples were compiled and evaluated in several European countries. nrpages: 354 status: publishe...|$|R

The IEBS allows for more detailed overviews of employment histories as well as comprehensive analyses on active labour market policy. The spells related to participation in measures contain numerous cases on the following measures in active labour market policy: job-creation measures, settling-in allowance, business start-up allowance, measures to promote vocational training, German language courses and more.
