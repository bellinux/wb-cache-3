40|$|This paper empirically {{analyzes}} {{the short run}} performance of Tunisian initial public offerings (IPO). It sheds light on the determinants of IPO’s {{in a context of}} a frontier market characterized by high information asymmetry, low information efficiency, thin trading and the presence of “noise” traders. Using a sample of 34 Tunisian IPO’s from the period 1992 - 2008, we find that the average market adjusted initial return for the first three trading days is about 17. 8 percent. The level of underpricing is related to retained capital, underwriter’s price support, oversubscription, listing delay and the offer price. Age of the firm, its size {{and the size of the}} offer do not seem to reduce the amount of money left on the table by issuers. It appears also that underpricing is driven by irrational investors (ipoers) seeking for short-run capital gains. These results remain unchanged after controlling for the presence of institutional investors and the existence of <b>liquidity</b> <b>contract.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Many {{developing}} and industrial countries {{have sought to}} open their electricity industries to competition. In both contexts, policymakers and investors {{have to deal with}} the consequences of earlier, more partial sector liberalization measures. Foremost among these is the existence of long-term contracts with independent power producers (IPPs). The long-term nature of these contracts has complicated the introduction of more far-reaching sectoral reform designed to harness competitive market forces for the benefit of consumers. In developing countries, introducing competition is often coupled with breaking up and privatizing state-owned electricity monopolies. In this context, discussion of renegotiation of power purchase agreements has tended toward the polemical. At one end are those who resist any change, arguing that the"sanctity of contracts"precludes modification of contract terms. At the other end are those who favor governments taking coercive measures to modify existing contracts in the name of maximizing economic welfare and minimizing the burden of sector reform on consumers and on the state. Drawing on recent country experiences, the authors analyze alternative approaches to restructuring contracts and designing power markets to reduce rigidities and incentivize IPPs to participate more fully in wholesale power markets and to take on greater market risk. The authors conclude that forced market integration or forced contract negotiation have failed and are counterproductive. Conversely, in countries where IPPs provide a sizable proportion of generation capacity, ignoring market integration may result in insufficient market liquidity and discourage new entry, attenuating the scope for market forces to act for the benefit of consumers. Failure to adapt power purchase contracts and market rules imposes huge resource costs on the economy beyond the financial obligations consumers and taxpayers must bear. Based on recent experience, a combination of measures, including adaptation of specific market rules, contractual alternatives for enhancing market <b>liquidity,</b> <b>contract</b> buyout provisions, transitional financing mechanisms, and characteristics of the successor entity to the power purchaser, offer promising approaches for reconciling preexisting IPP contracts with new market structures and reducing the magnitude of above-market costs associated with such contracts.

40|$|This {{descriptive}} paper {{analyzes the}} performance of the private equity secondaries market during the financial crisis 2008 - 2009, {{in order to understand the}} effective liquidity of private equity investments during this episode of market stress. We document that the secondaries market followed the development of the crisis very closely, with effective market <b>liquidity</b> <b>contracting</b> in early 2009 to only a fraction of the volume earlier, and a quick recovery afterwards that showed no signs of more protracted turbulences than the stock market. We argue that the particular form of illiquidity in the secondaries market can be best understood as the cumulative effect of behavioral and accounting-based elements. The available evidence indicates that the liquidity and the relative resilience of the secondaries market are efficient. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze the nature of {{long-term}} <b>liquidity</b> <b>contracts</b> that arise between lenders and borrowers in the absence of perfect enforceability and when both parties are financially constrained. We study an infinite horizon dynamic contracting model between a borrower and a lender with the following features: The borrower, is credit-constrained, faces a stochastic project arrival process every period, can choose to renege each period, and can save through the lender. Projects are indivisible. The lender is resource- constrained, and can commit to the terms of the contract as long as it is ex-ante individually rational to do so. We show that: (i) Enforcement problems and endogenous resource constraints can severely curtail the possibility of financing projects, (ii) the economy exhibits investment cycles, (iii) credit is rationed if either the lender has too little capital or the borrower has too little financial collateral. This paper’s technical contribution is to show the existence and characterization of financial contracts that are solutions to a non- convex dynamic programming problem.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} implied (il) liquidity of vanilla options. Implied liquidity {{is based on the}} fundamental theory of conic finance, in which the one-price model is abandoned and replaced by a two-price model giving bid and ask prices for traded assets. The pricing is done by making use of non-linear distorted expectations. We first recall a two parameter distortion function representing the notions of risk aversion and absence of gain enticement. After reviewing under the Black-Scholes setting the theory and numerics of the calculation of bid-ask prices under conic finance theory, we introduce the concept of implied liquidity. In a fixed market with no movement in the cone of acceptable risks and hence no change in liquidity as the market is then fixed, the bid ask spread moves around nonlinearly with maturity and/or volatility. Because the spread can move in a constant market with no change in liquidity, spread itself is not a perfect measure of liquidity. Implied liquidity can overcome this criticism. We illustrate the theory on SP 500 and Dow Jones Index data. We show that for vanilla options we typically have for higher strikes (OTM) more implied illiquidity. We typically see not much term structure. Also, we perform a historical study, in which we clearly see a serious drying up of liquidity in the weeks post the Lehman bankruptcy. Next, we elaborate on stochastic liquidity behavior and potential <b>liquidity</b> <b>contracts</b> and modeling. Seen the evidence of changing liquidity in the recent past with a potentially very disruptive drying up of <b>liquidity,</b> these <b>contracts</b> could provide extra hedges for such circumstances. The above notion of implied liquidity leads toward a mean-reverting modeling of liquidity similar to stochastic volatility. We believe such stochastic liquidity modeling could be very useful in structured product pricing, delta-gamma-vega hedging studies and risk-management in general...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{relationships}} between credit default swap (CDS) premiums and bond yield spreads for nine emerging market sovereign borrowers. We find that these two measures of credit risk deviate considerably in the short run, due to factors such as <b>liquidity</b> and <b>contract</b> specifications, but we estimate a stable long-term equilibrium relationship for most countries. In particular, CDS premiums tend to move more than one-for-one with yield spreads, which we show is broadly consistent {{with the presence of}} a significant "cheapest-to-deliver" (CTD) option. In addition, we find a variety of cross-sectional evidence of a CTD option being incorporated into CDS premiums. In our analysis of the short-term dynamics, we find that CDS premiums often move ahead of the bond market. However, we also find that bond spreads lead CDS premiums for emerging market sovereigns more often than has been found for investment-grade corporate credits, consistent with the CTD option impeding CDS liquidity for our riskier set of borrowers. Furthermore, the CDS market is less likely to lead for sovereigns that have issued more bonds, suggesting that the relative liquidity of the two markets is a key determinant of where price discovery occurs. ...|$|R

The move to central clearing is a fundamental change in the structure of the market. Central clearing will help control counterparty credit risk, but it also has potential implications for market liquidity. We analyze the relationship between liquidity and central clearing using information on credit default swap clearing at ICE Trust and ICE Clear Europe. We find that the central counterparty chooses the most liquid contracts for central clearing, consistent with liquidity characteristics being important in determining the safety and efficiency of clearing. We further find that the introduction of central clearing is associated with a slight increase in the <b>liquidity</b> of a <b>contract.</b> This is consistent with two countervailing effects. On one hand, central clearing will likely increase collateral requirements relative to the pre-reform bilaterally-cleared market, thereby increasing clearing costs and possibly reducing the liquidity of the market.

40|$|A {{principal}} contracts optimally with {{an agent}} {{to operate a}} firm over an infinite time horizon when the agent is liquidity constrained and has access to private information about the sequence of cost realizations. We formulate this mechanism design problem as a recursive dynamic program in which promised utility to the agent is the relevant state variable. By establishing that output distortions and the stringency of liquidity constraints decrease monotonically in promised utility, {{we are able to}} interpret the state variable as the agent’s equity in the firm. We establish a bang-bang property of optimal contracts wherein the agent is incentivised only through adjustments to his future utility until achieving a critical level of equity, after which he may be incentivised through cash payments, that is, through instantaneous rents. Thus the incentive scheme resembles what is commonly regarded as a sweat equity contract, with all cash payments net of costs (rents) being back loaded. A critical level of sweat equity occurs when none of the agent’s liquidity constraints bind. At this point, the contract calls for efficient production in all future periods and the agent attains a vested ownership stake in the firm. Finally, properties of the theoretically optimal contract are shown to be similar to features common in real-world work-to-own franchising agreements and venture capital <b>contracts.</b> <b>liquidity,</b> sweat equity, monotone contract, franchising, venture capital, ownership...|$|R

The results also suggest that the initial specification of diammonium phosphate futures contract may have resulted in its use as a forward contract with a high rate of delivery, reducing market participation and limiting <b>liquidity.</b> Ultimately, the <b>contract</b> failed because it was a poor hedging tool, and was perceived by the industry not to offer benefit beyond existing contracting and risk management practices.

Subsequent {{to the introduction}} in Chapter one, the second chapter deals with extreme dependence between the CDS spreads of major European banks and shows that the propensity of a bank to experience extreme co-movements in its CDS premia together with the market is priced in the bank's default swap spread during the recent financial crisis.

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} three chapters. The {{first two}} chapters {{concentrate on the}} sovereign debt market and study how domestic holdings of government debt and financial intermediation influence yields and equilibrium debt levels. An innovative perspective emerges from these studies: Sovereign default risk and government yields crucially depend {{on the size of}} domestic debt and on its influence on the domestic credit market. This perspective surpasses the traditional view that exclusively relates sovereign default risk to the size of external debt and the economic cycle. The third chapter empirically investigates the functioning of international capital markets and the behavior of market participants. The chapter studies how the different return components of aggregate equity and bond markets influence mutual fund flows and vice-versa. Two interesting results emerge. Firstly, the non-contemporaneous correlation between flows and returns is found to be predictable {{at least in the short}} run. This result rejects the standard perfect market assumption in macro-models which implies that the correlation between flows and returns is strictly contemporaneous. Secondly, evidence is found that excess returns in the equity markets are driven by cash-flow news. This is in contrast with the typical finding in the literature that discount rates news is the main driver of excess returns. Identifying determinants of government incentives to default is central to understand how equilibrium prices and quantities iare determined in sovereign debt markets. The scholarly literature has focused on two factors to explain default risk: the size of external debt and the fluctuation of the economic cycle. While these two dimensions are certainly important, another aspect seems equally important: the internal versus external composition of debt. Reinhart and Rogoff (2008) empirically investigate the importance of domestic debt for sovereign default episodes and conclude that there is a “forgotten history of domestic debt”. While domestic debt dynamics are relevant to understand sovereign default risk, very little research has been devoted to it. The first chapter of my thesis fills in the gap by incorporating domestic debt in a theoretical model of sovereign default. This extension leads to three contributions. The first is a positive one. While standard sovereign default models (i. e. Arellano, 2008 and Aguiar and Gopinath, 2006) assume exogenous output costs to default, the introduction of domestic debt allows me to illustrate an endogenous mechanism linking defaults and output contractions through the credit market which is consistent with the empirics. The second contributions is quantitative. The introduction of domestic debt helps to reproduce the high debt to GDP ratios and the low frequency of default that is found in the empirics. Finally the last contribution is normative. When domestic investors act competitively domestic debt levels are found to be inefficiently low. A case is made for the introduction of Pigouvian subsidies that subsidize domestic purchases of government debt. Sovereign defaults and banking crises tend to come in pairs. Understanding the link between these two phenomena is relevant to understand how the risk of sovereign default is priced by financial markets. In the second chapter of the thesis I focus on the underlying mechanisms of contagion between public debt and bank’s balance sheet. Using disaggregated banking data I analyze empirically the channels through which sovereign debt crises transmit to the banking sectors. I find that one of the main propagation mechanism operates through the collateral channel. When the default risk is high the price of government debt falls and the value of the asset that banks can pledge as a collateral on the wholesale market for <b>liquidity</b> <b>contracts.</b> Funding difficulties transmit thorough the balance sheet to the credit supply. The cyclicality of credit supply magnifies the negative impact of sovereign debt crises on output and consumption reducing the ex-ante incentives of issuing domestic debt. Lenders of last resort may mitigate the contraction of the credit supply in bad times offering liquidity in exchange for government debt. Following the monetary authority intervention the credit market recovers, sovereign yields fall and higher debt levels become sustainable. The third chapter studies the functioning of international equity and bond markets and the behavior of its participant. The chapter focuses on the interaction between different return components of aggregate equity and portfolio flows. First, international equity and bond market returns are decomposed into changes in expectations of future real cash payments, interest rates, exchange rates, and discount rates. News about future cash flows, rather than discount rates, is the main driver of international stock returns. This evidence is in contrast with the typical results reported only for the US. Inflation news instead is the main driver of international bond returns. Next, the interaction between these return components and international portfolio flows is analyzed. Evidence consistent with price action, short-term trend chasing, and short-run overreaction in the equity market is found. International bond flows to emerging markets are found to be more sensitive to interest rate shocks than equity flows...|$|R
5000|$|The {{shares of}} the DLC parents {{represent}} claims on exactly the same underlying cash flows. In integrated and efficient financial markets, stock prices of the DLC parents should therefore move in lockstep. In practice, however, large differences from theoretical price parity can arise. For example, in the early 1980s Royal Dutch NV was trading at a discount of approximately 30% relative to Shell Transport and Trading PLC. In the academic finance literature, Rosenthal and Young (1990) and Froot and Dabora (1999) show that significant mispricing in three DLCs (Royal Dutch Shell, Unilever, and Smithkline Beecham) has existed {{over a long period}} of time. Both studies conclude that fundamental factors (such as currency risk, governance structures, legal <b>contracts,</b> <b>liquidity,</b> and taxation) are not sufficient to explain the magnitude of the price deviations. Froot and Dabora (1999) show that the relative prices of the twin stocks are correlated with the stock indices of the markets on which each of the twins has its main listing. For example, if the FTSE 100 rises relative to the AEX index (the Dutch stock market index) the stock price of Reed International PLC generally tends to rise relative to the stock price of Elsevier NV. De Jong, Rosenthal, and van Dijk (2008) report similar effects for nine other DLCs. A potential explanation is that local market sentiment affects the relative prices of the {{shares of the}} DLC parent companies. Because of the absence of [...] "fundamental reasons" [...] for the mispricing, DLCs have become known as a textbook example of arbitrage opportunities, see for example Brealey, Myers, and Allen (2006, chapter 13).|$|R
40|$|An {{aggregator}} is {{a technology}} that consolidates liquidity—in the form of bid and ask prices and amounts—from multiple sources into a single unified order book to facilitate ‘best-price’ execution. It is widely used by traders in financial markets, particularly those in the globally fragmented spot currency market. In this paper, I study the properties of execution in an aggregator where multiple liquidity providers (LPs) compete for a trader’s uninformed flow. There are two main contributions. Firstly, I formulate {{a model for the}} <b>liquidity</b> dynamics and <b>contract</b> formation process, and use this to characterize key trading metrics such as the observed inside spread in the aggregator, the reject rate due to the so-called ‘last-look’ trade acceptance process, the effective spread that the trader pays, as well as the market share and gross revenues of the LPs. An important observation here is that aggregation induces adverse selection where the LP that receives the trader’s deal request will suffer from the ‘Winner’s curse’, and this effect grows stronger when the trader increases the number of participants in the aggregator. To defend against this, the model allows LPs to adjust the nominal spread they charge or alter the trade acceptance criteria. This interplay is a key determinant of transaction costs. Secondly, I analyse the properties of different execution styles. I show that when the trader splits her order across multiple LPs, a single provider that has quick market access and for whom it is relatively expensive to internalize risk can effectively force all other providers to join her in externalizing the trader’s flow thereby maximizing the market impact and aggregate hedging costs. It is therefore not only the number, but also the type of LP and execution style adopted by the trader that determines transaction costs...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} contains four {{studies on}} different market structures {{and their impact}} on market quality. Article I studies the effect of introducing stock index futures contracts on the underlying stocks. The results indicate a lower liquidity level in the underlying stocks. However, after introducing market makers to the futures market, liquidity improves in the underlying stocks while trading activity and volatility remain unchanged. Article II investigates price discovery in the gold futures markets in China and the US. The gold supply and demand from China have been among the world’s largest in recent years. The results show that the gold futures markets in China and the US are cointegrated. Despite its short history, the Chinese gold futures market contributes more to the price discovery than the US market. Article III examines the order aggressiveness of high-frequency traders (HFTs) and non-HFTs. We find that market-making HFTs follow their own group's previous order more than they follow other traders’ orders. Opportunistic HFTs and non-HFTs tend to split market orders into small portions and submit them in sequences. HFTs adhere strongly to the trade-off between waiting cost and the cost of immediate execution. Non-HFTs care less about this trade-off, but react somewhat stronger to volatility than HFTs. Article IV studies the impact of introducing <b>contracted</b> <b>liquidity</b> providers to the liquid stocks in Sweden. The results show that liquidity improves after the liquidity providers’ introduction.

40|$|This thesis {{includes}} three {{essays on the}} interaction between financial market institutions and market liquidity, {{and its implications for}} financial stability. The first essay studies an overlapping generations model of a risky asset market in which some agents face a participation cost. Market participation, by affecting the size of the pool of potential holders of the risky asset, determines the liquidity of the asset market. This essay studies how the frictions that are associated with capital requirements on financial institutions affect their incentives to supply liquidity to the market. The participation decision generates a positive and a negative externality, and the interaction between the two externalities can give rise to multiple equilibria in participation, i. e. to "liquidity cycles". The second essay studies the complementary problem of the optimal design of incentive systems for financial institutions in the context of limited market <b>liquidity.</b> In a <b>contract</b> between a borrower and a lender, financial incentives are provided by requiring the borrower to finance a sufficiently large share of her investment project. In the states of nature in which many projects are liquidated simultaneously, liquidation in private contracts is excessive relative to the efficient (second-best) contract chosen by a planner who internalizes the externality working through the liquidation price. This essay studies whether capital requirements on the borrowers can implement the second best allocation, and if not what kind of policy instruments can implement it. (cont.) The last essay presents a model of international lending that is built on a basic form of contractual incompleteness: foreign investors cannot commit to provide state-contingent or long-term finance to domestic entrepreneurs. This form of contractual incompleteness implies that there is excessive liquidation of socially viable projects in the competitive equilibrium that emerges in decentralized markets. Institutions that manage to limit liquidation have the potential to improve welfare. by Roberto Benelli. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Economics, 2002.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the differential impact of illegal insider trading on liquidity {{in the alternative}} market structures of the NYSE (specialist), NASDAQ (dealer), and the CBOE (hybrid). Using US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) prosecuted insider trades, we investigate changes in bid ask spread measures. This study contributes to, and extends, the literature on insider trading in several ways. Firstly, by specifically examining SEC prosecuted insider trading cases, this thesis utilises a direct measure of informed trading and adverse selection risk. Secondly, literature in the field has mainly focused on event studies. This is the first study to {{examine the impact of}} illegal insider trading on liquidity in a cross-sectional framework. Thirdly, it is also the first study to examine the impact of illegal insider trading on the <b>liquidity</b> of option <b>contracts,</b> in addition to investigating the relationship between informed trading in the options and underlying stock of a company. Finally, since the identification of informed traders by market makers is dependent on the implicit trader anonymity built in to the alternative market structures, this study also contributes to literature on trader anonymity, by examining the level of trader anonymity - {{the extent to which a}} trader is recognized as informed – afforded to illegal insider traders on each market. Results indicate that bid ask spreads are greater on the NYSE on insider trading days, but narrower or unchanged on NASDAQ, which suggests that the specialist system offers less trader anonymity than the competitive dealer system. However, our cross-sectional regressions reveal that it is the trade characteristics of the informed trades which possibly signal the presence of informed traders to market makers. In addition we also find that paired option trades of NASDAQ underlying stocks experience an improvement in liquidity, while NYSE underlying stock options experience no significant change. These findings suggest that the hybrid market structure is in fact fragmented like the NASDAQ dealer system and offers greater trader anonymity than the NYSE specialist system. Furthermore, we find that the main determinant of option spreads is the quoted spreads of the underlying stocks, which lend further support to Cho and Engle’s (1998) derivative hedge theory...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Applied Mathematics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. A topical {{issue in}} {{financial}} economics {{is the development}} of appropriate stochastic dynamic models for banking items and behavior. The issue here is to fulfil the need to generalize the more traditional discrete-time models of banking activity to a Levy process setting. In this thesis, under the assumption that the loan market is imperfectly competitive, we investigate the evolution of banking items such as bank assets (cash, bonds, shares, Treasuries, reserves, loans and intangible assets), liabilities (demand deposits) and bank capital (bank equity, subordinate debt and loan loss reserves). Here we consider the influence of macroeconomic factors and profitability as well as its indicators return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). As far as bank assets are concerned, we note that loan pricing models usually reflect the financial funding cost, risk premium to compensate for the risk of default by the borrower, a premium reflecting market power exercised by the bank and the sensitivity of the cost of capital raised to changes in loans extended. On the other hand, loan losses can be associated with an offsetting expense called the loan loss provision (LLP), which is charged against Nett profit. This offset will reduce reported income but has no impact on taxes, although when the assets are finally written off, a tax-deductible expense is created. An important factor influencing loan loss provisioning is regulation and supervision. Measures of capital adequacy are generally calculated using the book values of assets and equity. The provisioning of loans and their associated write-offs will cause a decline in these capital adequacy measures, and may precipitate increased regulation by bank authorities. Greater level of regulation generally entail additional costs for the bank. Currently, this regulation mainly takes the form of the Basel II Capital Accord that has been implemented on the worldwide basis since 2008. It is clear that bank profitability is a major indicator of financial crises for households, companies and financial institutions. An example of this from the 2007 - 2008 subprime mortgage crisis (SMC) is the U. S. bank, Wachovia Corp., who reported a big loss as from the first quarter of 2007 and eventually was bought by the world's largest bank, Citigroup, on 29 September 2008. A further example from the SMC is that both the failure of the Lehman Brothers investment bank and the acquisition in September 2008 of Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns by Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase, respectively, were preceded by a decrease in profitability and an increase in the price of loans and loan losses. The subprime mortgage crisis is characterized by <b>contracted</b> <b>liquidity</b> in the global credit markets and banking system. The level of liquidity in the banking sector affects the ability of banks to meet commitments as they become due without incurring substantial losses from liquidating less liquid assets. Liquidity, therefore, provides the defensive cash or near-cash resources to cover banks' liability. An undervaluation of real risk in the subprime market is cascading, rippling and ultimately severely adversely affecting the world economy. The downturn in the U. S. housing market, risky lending and borrowing practices, and excessive individual and corporate debt levels have caused multiple adverse effects tumbled as the US housing market slumped. Banks worldwide are hoarding cash and showing a growing reluctance to lend, driving rates that institutions charge to each other on loans to record highs. Also, global money markets are inoperative, forcing increased injections of cash from central banks. The crisis has passed through various stages, exposing pervasive weaknesses in the global financial system and regulatory framework. The stochastic dynamics of the aforementioned banking items assist in formulating a maximization problem that involves endogenous variables such as profit consumption, the value of the bank's investment in loans and provisions for loan losses as control variants. In particular, we demonstrate that the bank is able to maximize its expected utility of discounted profit consumption over a random time interval, [t,r], and terminal profit at time r. Here the term profit consumption refers to the consumption of the bank's profits by dividend payments on equity and interest and principal payments on subordinate debt. The associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation has a smooth solution when the optimal controls are computed by means of power, logarithmic and exponential utility functions. This enables us to make a direct comparison between the economic properties of the solutions for different choices of the utility function. In keeping with the main theme of this thesis, we simulate the financial indices ROE and ROA that are two measures of bank profitability. We further discuss optimization with power utility where we show the convergence of the Markov Chain Approximation Method (MCAM) and the impact of varying the model parameters in the form of loan loss severity, P, and loan loss frequency,. We investigate the connections between the banking models and Basel II capital accord as well as the current subprime mortgage crises. As a way of conclusion, we provide remarks about the main issues discussed in the thesis and speculate about future research directions. The contents of this thesis is based on 3 peer-reviewed journal articles (see [105], [106] and [107]) and 1 peer-reviewed conference proceedings paper (see [104]). In addition, the paper [108] is currently being prepared for submission to an accredited journal. Doctora...|$|R
40|$|Det norske lakseeventyret startet med brødrene Ove og Sivert Grøntvedt da de i 1970 satte ut 20 000 laksesmolt på Hitra, som i dag blir ansett som verdens første lakseanlegg. Siden den gang har laksemarkedet gjennomgått store forandringer. Introduksjonen av lakseoppdrett har gitt markedet en enorm vekst. I 2010 ble det produsert 1 460 000 tonn atlantisk laks på verdensbasis, hvorav Norge stod for omtrent 65 prosent av produksjonen. Dette gjør Norge til den helt klart største aktøren av oppdrettslaks på markedet, og i 2010 eksporterte vi laks til en verdi av omtrent 31, 3 mrd kroner. Laksprisen er preget av store svingninger. Det norsketablerte Fish Pool så en mulighet i denne usikkerheten og åpnet i 2006 en markedsplass for kontrakter med finansielt oppgjør hvor laks er underliggende aktiva. Aktørene på markedsplassen kan deles inn i to grupper, hvor den ene er spekulanter og den andre er aktive aktører (oppdrettere og foredlere) som ønsker å sikre seg mot ufordelaktige prissvingninger. Markedsplassen Fish Pool har siden oppstarten vært preget av relativt lav likviditet. Vi har i denne oppgaven sett på ulike utfordringer forbundet med den lave likviditeten, i tillegg har vi sett nærmere på prising av asiatiske opsjoner som man kan kjøpe og selge på Fish Pool. Oppgavens problemstilling er som følger: Hvilke utfordringer kan lav likviditet på Fish Pool gi for en aktør som handler laksederivatene? På grunn av den lave likviditeten, og derav et datasett som i stor grad er preget av manglende observasjoner, har vi rettet fokuset vekk fra tradisjonell analyse av derivatenes effektivitet i risikostyring, og heller sett på hvilke utfordringer den lave likviditeten kan medføre for aktører som bruker laksederivatene. I analysen av futureskontraktenes likviditet så vi at omsatt volum per år har økt betraktelig, samtidig fant vi en synkende trend i antall dager med nullavkastninger fra 2008 frem til 2011. Noe overraskende fant vi at 2007 har lavest antall dager med nullavkastning, en forklaring kan være at mange aktører kjøpte små kontrakter for å bli kjent med markedsplassen. Funnene våre tyder på at likviditeten på Fish Pool har økt siden oppstarten i 2006. For å kunne analysere futureskontraktene på Fish Pool har vi laget en kontinuerlig prisserie, for å gjøre dette må vi rulle kontraktene fra en periode til neste. Ved rulling av en futureskontrakt til neste blir man utsatt for rullehopp. I hvilken grad rullehoppet utgjør risiko for aktøren er avhengig av hvorvidt retning og størrelse på hoppet er kjent. På grunn av lav likviditet på Fish Pool kan vi ikke si noe om trend i forhold til rullehoppet, vi kan derfor ikke konkludere om rullehoppet utgjør en risiko for aktørene eller ikke. Ved prising av opsjoner forutsetter flere sentrale opsjonsprisingsmodeller at avkastningen til underliggende aktivum følger en normalfordeling. Med bakgrunn i at aktører på Fish Pool både kan kjøpe og selge (skrive) opsjoner ønsker vi gjennom denne oppgaven å undersøke hvorvidt avkastningen til Fish Pool IndeksTM følger en normalfordeling da dette er underliggende aktivum for opsjonene som omsettes på Fish Pool. For å analysere den historiske fordelingen til FPITM sin avkastning har vi grafet den gjennom statistikkprogrammet Oxmetrics. Videre har vi utført en Jarque-Bera test på avkastning for å se om fordelingen er {{signifiant}} forskjellig fra normalfordeling. Under de innledende analysene fant vi at fordelingen til FPITM tilsynelatende virket normalfordelt, som ikke stemmer overens med generell teori på området. Vi utvidet derfor analysen til å inkludere data fra SSB og NOS, som tilsammen utgjør 70 prosent av FPITM. Analysen av disse indeksene viste klart at både SSB og NOS avviker fra en normalfordeling. Vi har derfor konkludert med at det er lite trolig at FPITM er normalfordelt. Vi har brukt historisk volatilitet som utgangspunkt når vi beregnet teoretiske opsjonspriser ved bruk av Turnbull og Wakeman approksimasjonsmodellen. Selv om det er naivt å tro at volatiliteten i morgen blir lik som volatiliteten i dag, er dette det beste utgangspunktet vi har siden vi ikke har mulighet til å beregne implisitt volatilitet. Volatilitetsnivået viste seg å gi store utslag på opsjonsprisen i det teoretiske eksempelet. Hvilke volatilitet man legger til grunn for å prise en opsjon vil derfor ha stor betydning i forhold til prisen man får. Det er mange forhold man må ta hensyn til dersom man skal entre et marked med lav likviditet. I denne oppgaven har vi kartlagt flere utfordringer i forbindelse med likviditeten på markedsplassen Fish Pool. Blant annet har vi sett at lav likviditet kan skape prishopp, og hvordan man kan bli sittende i en ugunstig posisjon uten mulighet til å komme seg ut. Uansett hvilke forhold man har til risiko er det viktig å være klar over hvilke risikofaktorer man kan bli utsatt for før man går inn i et marked. The Norwegian salmon adventure {{began with}} the brothers Ove and Sivert Grøntvedt when they in 1970 established what today is considered the world's first salmon farm. Since then, the salmon market has undergone major changes. The introduction of salmon farming resulted in huge growth in the salmon market. In 2010 it was produced 1. 46 million tons of Atlantic salmon in the world, where Norway accounted for about 65 {{percent of the total}} production. This makes Norway by far the largest provider of farmed salmon, and in 2010 they exported salmon to a value of approximately 31. 3 billion NOK. Salmon prices are characterized by large fluctuations. The Norwegian company Fish Pool saw an opportunity in this uncertainty and established in 2006 a marketplace for contracts with a financial settlement, where salmon is the underlying asset. The participants in the marketplace can be divided into two groups, one of which is speculators, and the other is active participants (farmers and processors) who want to hedge against unfavorable price fluctuations. The marketplace Fish Pool has since it was established been characterized by relatively low liquidity. We have in this paper looked at the various challenges associated with the low liquidity, in addition, we looked more closely at the pricing of Asian options that one can buy and sell at Fish Pool. The Research question for this paper is as follows: What challenges might low liquidity in the market place Fish Pool give participants who trade salmon derivatives? Because of the low liquidity, and hence a data set that is largely characterized by a lack of observations, we have with this paper focused away from traditional analysis of derivatives efficiency in risk management, and instead focused on what challenges faced by the low liquidity may cause to participants who trade salmon derivatives. In our analysis of the futures <b>contract's</b> <b>liquidity,</b> we found that trading volume per year has increased significantly, {{at the same time we}} found a decreasing trend in the number of days with zero returns from 2008 until 2011. Surprisingly, we found that the 2007 has the lowest number of days with zero return, an explanation may be that many participants bought small contracts to learn how the market works. Our findings suggest that liquidity at Fish Pool has increased since it was established in 2006. In order to analyze the futures contracts at Fish Pool, we have created a continuous price series, and to do this we need to role the contracts from one period to the next. Rolling a futures contract from one to the next is subjected to rolling jumps. To what extent rolling jumps is a risk for participants in the market depends on whether the direction and size of the jump is known. Due to low liquidity in the Fish Pool, we can not say anything about the trend in relation to rolling jumps, therefore we can not conclude whether rolling jumps represents a risk for the participants or not. Several well-known option pricing models assumes that the return of the underlying asset follows a normal distribution in relation to pricing of options. Given that participants at Fish Pool can both buy and sell (write) options, we want through this paper to examine whether the return to the Fish Pool IndexTM follows a normal distribution as this is the underlying asset for options traded on Fish Pool. To analyze the historical distribution of FPITM's return, we graph it through the statistical program Oxmetrics. We have also performed a Jarque-Bera test on returns to see if the distribution is signifiant different from the normal distribution. During the initial analysis, we found that the distribution of FPITM seemingly is normal distribution, which does not match the general theory in this area. We therefore extended the analysis to include data from SSB and NOS, which together account for 70 percent of FPITM. The analysis of these indices showed clearly that both the SSB and NOS differ from a normal distribution. We have therefore concluded that it is unlikely that the FPITM is normally distributed. We have used historical volatility as a basis when we calculated the theoretical option prices using the Turnbull and Wakeman approximation model. Although it is naive to believe that the volatility of tomorrow will be the same as the volatility of today, this is the best foundation we have since we are unable to calculate implied volatility. Volatility levels were found to have major effects on the option price in the theoretical example. Which volatility that is used to price an option will therefore be of great importance in relation to the price that is calculated. There are many factors one must take into account when entering a market with low liquidity. In this paper we have identified several challenges in relation to liquidity in the marketplace Fish Pool. Among other things, we have seen that low liquidity may create price jumps, and how participants may be locked in an unfavorable position without the opportunity to get out of the market. Whatever risk preferences one has, it is important to be aware of the risk factors you can be exposed to before entering a market...|$|R
