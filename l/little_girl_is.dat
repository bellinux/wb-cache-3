At {{the opening of the}} play their baby daughter is christened, and the young couple is living happily in their home in Baltimore. This is in 1861, the opening of the Civil War. At the first rumors of hostilities, Mrs. North's brother enlisted in the ranks of the Confederacy. When North refuses to follow his example, and casts his lot with the Union army, his wife bids him good-bye forever. She asked him to choose between his flag and her. He salutes Old Glory, and goes to war. Four years later when he returns he finds his old home deserted, and although he tries in every way to discover the whereabouts of his wife and child he is unsuccessful. He moves to a northern home and there becomes commander of [...] GAR post. Mrs. North, who believed that her husband was killed in the war, comes North with her brother and her little grandchild to attend the reunion of the Confederate veterans and the GAR. While out working with her grandmother, the <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>is</b> lost, and is picked up by North on his way to attend the reunion. Through the police the grandmother and uncle are notified of the whereabouts of the child, and when they come to claim her at the GAR post, there are mutual recognitions, and Mr. and Mrs. North are reunited. There is but one flag now, the blue and the gray clasp hands beneath its folds." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Daily Gazettes Susan Reimer {{felt that}} the Madeline {{educational}} games helped to revive girls' interest in computers and changed their preconceptions of them as [...] "that solitary, isolating experience".

[...] A writer from The Beacon News thought the series resonated with girls because the main character is a young girl. The writer followed up by noting the difficulty in finding software suited for girls. Mark Ivey and Elizabeth Kemper from Daily News thought the series was an example of how software developers were making strides toward creating quality girls' software that matched what had been created for boys. [...] James Madge of The Toronto Star said the games were [...] "edutainment... geared at girls", and Selling to Kids wrote that through their Madeline series Creative Wonders was [...] "targeting girls" [...] and [...] "get girls thinking."

2500|$|Tad is furious, however, that Dixie let him and JR {{think that}} she was dead for four years without a word. He grows even angrier when he learns that she gave away Kate after letting Greg Madden {{convince}} her that Tad could not love a daughter, who, Madden claimed, would remind him of Dixie's death too much for him to love the child properly. Tad vents his anger while testifying at Dixie's trial when she stands accused of Greg Madden's murder. Afterwards, though, the two begin to reconcile. Tad invites her for a date one morning, and Dixie accepts. However, in 2007, she dies that day after eating poisoned pancakes that were meant for her daughter-in-law (Babe). Babe's attempted murderer is known as the Satin Slayer, a serial killer killing off the women of Fusion Cosmetics. Dixie's ghost/spirit later sees Tad playing with a little 4-year-old named Kathy and instinctively knows that the <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>is</b> actually their lost daughter [...] Kate. At first, no one else in Pine Valley knows this but Dixie. Adam, however, later discovers the child alive and keeps the knowledge to himself. He is conflicted {{on a number of occasions}} on whether to tell Tad, but ultimately decides against it when he finds out that Tad has married the woman he loves, Krystal Carey.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2010, it was {{reported}} that Lisa would return for a single episode later in the year in a bid to retrieve Louise from Phil, who gained custody of her earlier in the year.

[...] Executive producer Bryan Kirkwood commented [...] "Lucy's character Lisa was responsible for one of the biggest cliffhanger episodes in EastEnders, so it's a real treat to have her back on screen," [...] while a spokesperson for the show added [...] "Lisa Fowler was a major part of Phil's life– she knows him as well as anyone, so she won't be happy about him looking after his daughter. With their history, you know that this storyline {{is going to be an}} explosive episode in the Mitchells' history." [...] The episode was broadcast on 5 August 2010. Discussing her brief return, Benjamin said, [...] "What I liked about doing this storyline was that it did explain where Lisa had been. When I was watching it, I was thinking 'Where's her mother? Where is Lisa? It's just ridiculous'. But it does make sense. She is mentally unstable and she does have times like that and the <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>is</b> old enough to make her own decisions and say, 'I want to live with my dad now'. So she had to let her go. I liked that I was able to come back and defend myself because Lisa was kind of being slaughtered in the Square for being a rubbish mum!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1958, Bazlen won the {{starring}} role in the children’s program The Blue Fairy, broadcast by the independent station WGN-TV in Chicago on Monday nights (7.30pm–8.00pm). It {{was one of the}} earliest children’s shows to be produced in color. The producer of the show had spotted Bazlen playing hopscotch outside of Bazlen's Chicago home and told Bazlen's mother that [...] "your <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>is</b> just right for my TV series". In the show, the Blue Fairy, played by Bazlen, lived in the “Blue Forest." [...] Dressed in a blue gown and diamond tiara, she also clasped a [...] silver wand. At the beginning of each show, Bazlen, suspended by wires, would fly (as if on elfin wings) across the stage saying “I’m the Blue Fairy, I’ll grant you a wish to make all your dreams come true." [...] She would then sit on an oversized mushroom visited by creatures such as Tugnacious R. Jones, Myrtle Flower, and an old nasal voiced wizard (which were puppets designed by George Nelle and writer-director Don Kane), and introduced stories enacted by the Rufus Rose Marionettes. They also engaged in various projects which included constructing a popcorn machine that would not stop popping and making a sewing machine that turned out marbles. Bazlen won enormous critical praise for her performance (one critic describing it as “beguiling” and “mesmerising” and Hedda Hopper declared Bazlen “the Celtic Alice in Wonderland”) and the show was recognised as the top children’s program of 1958 winning a Peabody Award. Bazlen herself said of her role that she [...] "flew around and had a wonderful time." [...] Although The Blue Fairy could only be seen locally in Chicago on Channel 9, the Peabody Award it won brought it and Bazlen to national attention. Furthermore, the show also inspired Ernie Kovacs into doing one of his notorious comedy sketches where Kovacs (wearing a mustache, chewing a cigar, dressed in a blue gown and blonde wig, and holding a silver wand) flew across a stage, slammed head first into a wall on the opposite side, and was then left dangling lifelessly (in mock fashion) in mid-air.|$|E
2500|$|Between {{the years}} 1928-1932 he painted {{a group of}} {{paintings}} he called [...] "Stylized". In his Orange Grove painting he used familiar motifs in a highly stylized rendition of orange groves found everywhere {{at the time in}} Florida. The round form of the orange tree mimicked by the round oranges themselves broken up by the lines of palm fronds, fences and crates. The lake is repeating the line of the arched trunk hanging over it. The grouping of leaves each is repeating cleverly the whole form of the lake. The ornamental form of Euphorbias was a persistent stimulus which produced three important paintings. In one, Euphorbia expressed a freer flowing style with its long undulating branches waving as a Bali dancer would, leading to the creation of The Dancers. In fact the Bali mask in the painting suggests a comparison. The very young Bali girls perform their ceremonial dances by undulating motion of the arms rather than of the feet or body. Mulford tried to show that the plant does the same thing in ten years what the Bali dancer can do in ten minutes. The motion of the plant is solidified and has the duration of many years, while the dance of the <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>is</b> observed in but a fleeting glimpse of each movement. It is a unity of life's expressions with each form finding its happiness in expressing its rhythm within the limits of its timing. Another painting, Polynesian took as its pivot the five points of a talkative Stapelia whose form symbolizes heaven and sun. The pattern of the plant was echoed in the Polynesian tapa cloth which was the inspiration for the painting and is seen in the background. The angular Padilanthus was used as well to compose symphony of harmonious form. The idea of the painting was to build a symphonic interpretation of these motifs from their original primitive representations, reappearing again in living form. The few simple motifs are found repeated in each object with a natural simplicity which the artist has caught and tried to reproduce. Between the years 1930 and 1935 Mulford's paintings took on a combination of stylized and decorative style. The [...] "Philosophical" [...] series was started between 1932 and 1936. In Self Defense, every living thing has its own protection. This begins with the flowering date palm and its maze of thousand spikes or thorns pointing in every direction guarding reproduction from conception to maturing of egg cells that we call seeds or fruit. After this painting was completed, Mulford made a frame to hold it but immediately the frame seemed to defeat the purpose of the expression to be illustrated. The palm was confined. This led to painting the fronds on the frame, extending them {{up and out of the}} frame. He helped develop the Nyack Country Club in New York between the years 1932-1934. He used elephants to move and plow the dirt. Being the sensitive man that he was he observed that each elephant had his own personality and it was reflected in their eyes. His elephant painting reflects this insight. In Mimicry the artist sympathetically depicts the parallel relationship between one of the lizard's mannerisms and that of the Anthurium. The little tendrils and feet of the lowest white leaved vine compared to the little feet of the lizard. The appearance is very much the same. The leaves and flower in the painting represents the Aracae family, of which the calla lily is a member. They are among the earliest and simplest forms of plants. The lizard as well is a very early and simple form of the reptiles. The painting is filled with subtle repetitions with colors suggesting a deep primeval forest with its many hidden forms. He described the motivation behind the Climbers. It had been motivated by a huge, old, gnarled vine growing outside his studio at Tropical Arts. The vine in his painting climbs up the tree trunk for light and air. A small tendril is the intelligence part of the vine. It is the guide for its motivation. Likewise the small tender tongue of the snake is the sensitive ear and nose which guide the snake to quiet resting places. The parallel means of motivation of these two forms create the similar shape of their bodies and a similar type of intelligence. The vine and snake are both elemental and early forms of life, assembled in harmonious composition in this painting. His series Impressions of Mexico was completed between 1936 and 1938.|$|E
