50|$|Typically, {{the real}} estate agent has the {{experience}} and data to determine a suitable <b>listing</b> <b>price</b> for the seller's property and will recommend a <b>listing</b> <b>price</b> to the seller.

If the seller's price is unrealistically high and the agent cannot convince the seller otherwise, the agent can decline to list the property.|$|R
40|$|Purpose In Italy {{selling prices}} are not public {{information}} and therefore <b>listing</b> <b>prices</b> {{play a key}} role for market analyses and are used by real estate companies and appraisers for estimating house values. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore the listing behaviours of agents and sellers. In particular, the paper analyzes <b>listing</b> <b>prices</b> and the predicting power of the house features described in advertisements, to improve their use in real estate valuations. Design/methodology/approach We employed a traditional hedonic model to measure the overall contribution to <b>listing</b> <b>price</b> of the characteristics described in advertisements. We performed the analysis both on houses put on the market by agents and on houses put on the market by sellers. We analyzed <b>listing</b> <b>price</b> distributions and their deviation from normality. Furthermore, we performed the hedonic analysis, which consisted in two steps. Firstly, the coefficient of determination for any characteristic was computed. Secondly, we measured the overall contribution to the <b>listing</b> <b>price</b> of the characteristics described in advertisements. Findings The analysis shows the presence of factors which affect <b>listing</b> <b>prices</b> and which are not revealed to buyers in real estate advertisements. On the other hand, we also found the presence of characteristics that do not affect the <b>listing</b> <b>price</b> but are described in advertisements. Furthermore, agents and sellers showed different behaviours. While the marginal contributions of each characteristic estimated on a sample of houses put on the market by agents were significant, our analysis reveals that <b>listing</b> <b>prices</b> of houses put on the market by sellers themselves are not explained by the house features. Originality/value To our knowledge, this is the first study to propose a hedonic approach to exploring the major determinants of <b>listing</b> <b>prices</b> of houses on sale on the Italian market. The listing behaviour of agents and sellers and the predicting power of the observable characteristics could address the use of <b>listing</b> <b>prices</b> in real estate valuations. At the same time, the potential presence of unobservable factors that affect the <b>listing</b> <b>price</b> could be a source of bias in estimating the value of houses...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This article {{examines}} the usefulness of <b>listing</b> <b>prices</b> as leading indicators of house values and as predictors of the direction of housing markets. With Multiple Listing Service data from a large metropolitan area, we create two price indexes, using first <b>listing</b> <b>price</b> and then selling price {{as the dependent variable}} in the hedonic regressions. The market is then geographically and categorically segmented, and Granger causality tests are performed to analyze the leading aspect of <b>list</b> <b>prices</b> in the <b>list</b> price-sales <b>price</b> relationship. We find that different segments of the market perform quite differently over the time period of our study, suggesting that for data-based appraisal purposes care is needed in determining the manner and level of aggregation. We also find, however, that market <b>list</b> <b>prices</b> continue to convey important information about subsequent selling prices in most market segments...|$|R
5|$|Further {{complicating the}} sales {{situation}} was the announcement by JaguarSport of a road-going {{version of the}} Jaguar XJR-9, {{the last of the}} racing cars to feature the Jaguar V12 engine. The Jaguar XJR-15 was developed by TWR and styled by Peter Stevens whilst the XJ220 was being developed at Jaguar, and featured the V12 engine {{and a host of other}} technologies not adopted for the XJ220, including carbon fibre construction and the option of a six-speed racing gearbox. It was considerably rarer and more expensive than the XJ220 when it went on sale; only 50 were built, each with a <b>list</b> <b>price</b> of £600,000 ($1 million) in 1990. It was designed primarily for racing but could be specified as a road-legal vehicle. About half were built as road-going variants, which added £55,000 to the <b>list</b> <b>price.</b>|$|E
5|$|The high-right policy led to {{a series}} of {{machines}} with ever-increasing prices. The original Macintosh plans called for a system around $1,000, but by the time it had morphed from Jef Raskin's original vision of an easy-to-use machine for composing text documents to Jobs' concept incorporating ideas gleaned during a trip to Xerox PARC, the Mac's <b>list</b> <b>price</b> had ballooned to $2,495. From there, the price of Mac systems continued to climb: the Macintosh Plus was slightly more expensive at $2,599, the SE was $2,900 or $3,900 depending on the model, and a basic Macintosh II with a 40 MB hard drive was at least $5,500 (at launch, with the price increasing in late 1988). More modern machines cost even more: the Macintosh IIcx was $5,369, the IIci $6,269, and the IIfx $9,900 - all without monitors or keyboards. Color CRTs were relatively expensive in the late 1980s; Apple's 14-inch 640×480 monitor had a <b>list</b> <b>price</b> of $999 and Apple's ADB keyboards, while of high quality, were similarly expensive. The only inexpensive machine in the lineup by the late 1980s was the several-year-old Mac Plus, which was now selling for around $1,800.|$|E

25|$|Airbus and Boeing publish <b>list</b> <b>prices</b> {{for their}} {{aircraft}} {{but the actual}} prices charged to airlines vary; they {{can be difficult to}} determine and tend to be much lower than the <b>list</b> <b>prices.</b> Both manufacturers are engaged in a price competition to defend their market share.|$|R
40|$|<b>List</b> <b>prices</b> are not {{completely}} credible as {{take it or leave}} it prices: buyers are able to seek reductions by bargaining with firms. We show that this realisation leads to the existence of a critical threshold number of competitors in an industry which depends on fundamentals. In industries with fewer competitors than the critical level, there is productivity diffuson delay: low and high cost firms coexist, <b>list</b> <b>prices</b> have no information value and transaction price dispersion exists. Above this critical number of competitors, efficient firms price to drive the high cost firms from the market: productivity gains diffuse to consumers and <b>list</b> <b>prices</b> now carry cost information. Prices never fall to the Bertrand floor however. All of these results are in close keeping with, and provide an explanation for empirical results showing productivity dispersion persistence and the explanatory power of having 5 competitors or more (Nickell 1996).

5|$|However, {{the initial}} {{popularity}} of the PowerBook100 did not last. Sales decreased, and by December 1991 the 140 and 170 models had become more popular because customers {{were willing to pay}} more for a built-in floppy disk drive and second serial port, which the PowerBook100 lacked. By August 10, 1992, Apple quietly dropped the PowerBook100 from its price list but continued to sell existing stock through its own dealers and alternative discount consumer-oriented stores such as Price Club. In these stores, a 4MB RAM/40MB hard drive configuration with a floppy drive sold for less than $1,000 (more than $1,500 less than the similar 2MB/20MB configuration's original <b>list</b> <b>price).</b>|$|E
5|$|The XJ220 was not {{initially}} {{intended to be}} a production car, but, following the reception of the concept and financial interest from serious buyers, a feasibility study was carried out by teams from TWR and Jaguar. Its conclusion was that such a car would be technically feasible (subject to engineering changes), {{and that it would be}} financially viable. The announcement of a limited production run of 220 to 350 cars came on 20 December 1989. The <b>list</b> <b>price</b> on 1 January 1990 was £290,000 exclusive of value added tax, options and delivery charges, but by 1992 that had increased considerably owing to indexation of contracts. The offer was four times oversubscribed, and deposits of £50,000 exclusive of Value Added Tax (VAT) were taken from around 1400 customers; first deliveries were planned for mid-1992.|$|E

Massachusetts homes exposed to the policy change experienced a $ 16, 000 reduction in sale price relative to Rhode Island homes. Slow-moving homes suffered a greater reduction, but newer listings only had a small increase in sale price. One reason is that some buyers were unaware of sellers’ manipulation of days on market and thus unable to recognize authentically new listings.
