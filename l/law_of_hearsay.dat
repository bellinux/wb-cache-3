5000|$|The {{rules of}} hearsay began to form {{properly}} {{in the late}} seventeenth century and had become fully established by the early nineteenth century. The issues were analysed in substantial detail in Wright v Doe d Tatham. The technical nature of the discussion in Doe d Tatham inhibited much reasoned progress of the law, whose progress (in the form of judicial capacity to reform it) ended not long afterwards. Later attempts to reform through the common law it got little further, with Lord Reid in Myers v DPP saying If we are to extend the law it must be by the development and application of fundamental principles. We cannot introduce arbitrary conditions or limitations; that must be left to legislation: {{and if we do}} in effect change the law, we ought in my opinion only to do that in cases where our decision will produce some finality or certainty. If we disregard technicalities in this case and seek to apply principle and common sense, {{there are a number of}} parts of the existing <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearsay</b> susceptible of similar treatment, ... The only satisfactory solution is by legislation following on a wide survey of the whole field ... A policy of make do and mend is not appropriate. There was some statutory reform in the nineteenth century (see Bankers' Books Evidence Act 1879), and later the Evidence Act 1938 made some further if cautious reforms. The state of the hearsay rules were regarded as 'absurd' by Lord Reid and Lord Diplock.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, I {{will look}} at the problem of hearsay and {{confrontation}} through the lens offered by this symposium 2 ̆ 7 s theme of 2 ̆ 2 truth and its rivals. 2 ̆ 2 I will ask: To what extent does the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearsay</b> and confrontation aspire to achieve the goal of truth in litigation? To what extent does it, or should it, seek to achieve other goals, or to satisfy other constraints on the litigation system? And, given the ends that it seeks to achieve, what should the shape of the law in this area be? My principal conclusions are as follows: In most settings, the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearsay</b> should be concerned nearly exclusively with achieving the goal of truth determination, subject to constraints related to the cost of litigation. For the most part, the current <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearsay</b> does a poor job in this respect and even is sometimes counterproductive. In one setting of great importance, what I will call the confrontation setting, the law in this area has a great service to perform. That service-protecting the conditions under which testimony against an accused is taken-bears some relation to truth determination but is not dominated by it and has {{very little to do with}} cost considerations. In this context, the United States Supreme Court has generally been insufficiently protective of the accused 2 ̆ 7 s rights, regarding hearsay law as an old-fashioned nuisance that must be tolerated to a minimal extent but that should be kept firmly in its place. To provide some groundwork for my discussion of hearsay topics, I will address rather briefly the general theme of 2 ̆ 2 truth and its rivals. 2 ̆...|$|E
40|$|The <b>law</b> <b>of</b> {{criminal}} <b>hearsay</b> in England and Wales {{has undergone}} substantial evolution in recent times. This article offers {{an analysis of}} these developments, undertaken {{against the background of}} a consideration of the reforms <b>of</b> <b>hearsay</b> doctrine that had taken place some years earlier in Canada. The relevant law in England and Wales appears highly regulated, being governed by detailed statutory provisions and subject further to an express “confrontation” guarantee contained in the European Convention on Human Rights. The Canadian law, by contrast, developed in a more piecemeal fashion and is not subject to any express “confrontation” guarantee. Comparisons <b>of</b> the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> criminal <b>hearsay</b> in England and Wales with that in Canada having largely been ignored in the academic literature,this article fills the gap and asks whether scholars and practitioners in each jurisdiction may gain valuable insights from the experiences of their counterparts across the Atlantic...|$|R
40|$|To {{know your}} law {{and not to}} {{understand}} {{it is like a}} legal barbarian lost in the battlefield of legal theory. A proper and thorough understanding <b>of</b> the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> evidence and <b>hearsay</b> evidence in particular, is of paramount importance not only for lawyers but also for persons who regard themselves as labour law experts. It takes a great deal of experience before a lawyer truly becomes confident with the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> evidence and its application. The only way one becomes good at it is firstly to know the law. (Where does it come from and why is it there?) Then one must get to understand it by looking at examples and apply it in practice. Only then will a person gain practical experience. The aim of this treatise is not to try and educate experienced lawyers. This article is aimed at those that need some motivation to pursue their journey in the labour law process. Remember we all assume that lawyers know and understand their subject until they proof the contrary. In this work I shall try to highlight the importance <b>of</b> the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> evidence in labour law proceedings. Firstly the meaning <b>of</b> the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> evidence and <b>hearsay</b> evidence is considered. Further emphasis will be on the approach and application <b>of</b> the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> evidence, and in particular the hearsay rule, in labour law proceedings...|$|R

This Comment will examine the rationale behind the new hearsay exception, the particular requirements of § 1370, and its compliance with other provisions of the Code and the California Constitution. Finally, this Comment will examine the application of § 1370 to the admission of evidence in the civil trial against OJ Simpson...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{good reason}} why {{evidence}} scholars continue to be fascinated and perplexed, and some courts continue at least to be perplexed, by the types of evidence that tend to be lumped together misleadingly under the headings nonassertive conduct or implied assertions. Evidence of this sort highlights a paradox of the prevailing <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearsay.</b> I believe that this paradox cannot be resolved without fundamentally transforming the structure of that law. Thus, while I agree - within the current framework - {{with many of the}} insights so ably stated in this Symposium, I think evidence scholars must devote their efforts to construction of a better structure...|$|E
40|$|The {{adjudication}} {{of child}} abuse claims poses an excruciatingly difficult conundrum. The crime is a terrible one, but false convictions are abhorrent. Often the evidence does not support a finding of guilt or innocence with sufficient clarity to allow a decision free of gnawing doubt. In many cases, {{a large part of}} the problem is that the prosecution 2 ̆ 7 s case depends critically on the statement or testimony of a young child. Even with respect to adult witnesses, the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearsay</b> and confrontation is very perplexing, as anyone who has studied American evidentiary law and read Supreme Court opinions on the subject knows. Juxtaposing problems of hearsay and confrontation with those of child sexual abuse yields one of the most intractable problems that a system of criminal justice can face...|$|E

Justice Stephen Breyer, a member of the plurality, wrote a concurring opinion citing this brief favorably and suggested that a future case might call for the Court to adopt its approach...|$|E
40|$|In Crawford v. Washington, the Supreme Court {{announced}} {{a major change}} in Confrontation Clause doctrine, abandoning a decades-old framework that focused on the common <b>law</b> principles <b>of</b> <b>hearsay</b> analysis: necessity and reliability. The new doctrine, grounded in an originalist interpretation of the Sixth Amendment, requires courts to determine whether a particular statement is testimonial. But the Court has struggled to present a coherent definition of the term testimonial. In its subsequent decisions, the Court illustrated that its new Confrontation Clause doctrine could be used to bar forensic evidence, including laboratory test results, if the government failed to produce the technician who conducted the test. This Note explores the implications of Crawford and its progeny through the lens of one piece of forensic evidence: facial recognition technology. As facial recognition technology continues to gain purchase as a law enforcement tool, prosecutors are increasingly likely to attempt to introduce such evidence in court. Recognizing the interpretative difficulty created by the deep divides that remain on the Court over the proper scope of the Confrontation Clause, this Note argues that, under the Crawford framework, facial recognition evidence is testimonial and, therefore, requires confrontation...|$|R

40|$|In Tome v United States, for {{the fifth}} time in eight years, the Supreme Court decided a case {{presenting}} the problem of how a child 2 ̆ 7 s allegations of sexual abuse should be presented in court. Often the child who charges that an adult abused her is unable to testify at trial, or at least unable to testify effectively under standard procedures. These cases therefore raise intriguing and difficult questions related to the rule against hearsay and to an accused 2 ̆ 7 s right under the Sixth Amendment to confront the witnesses against him. One would hardly guess that, however, from the rather arid debate in Tome, which focused on a seemingly technical question concerning the interpretation of a provision in the hearsay portion of the Federal Rules of Evidence. In this article, I will examine both that question and some of the broader issues surrounding it. I will use Tome as a vehicle to explore what I believe is the impoverished state of the law concerning the admissibility of prior statements of a witness. This state, I will argue, is attributable in part to the Court 2 ̆ 7 s longstanding unwillingness to recognize that a party may be substantially hindered in attempting to examine a witness with respect to a prior statement the truth of which the witness no longer affirms. A complete solution to the problem, however, would require a dramatic restructuring of the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearsay</b> and confrontation, a prospect that I will touch on only briefly in the conclusion to this article...|$|E
40|$|For {{the first}} three {{quarters}} of the twentieth century, the Wigmore treatise was the dominant force in organizing, setting out, and explaining the American law of evidence. Since then, the first two of those roles have been taken over in large part by the Federal Rules of Evidence (Rules). And the third has been performed most notably by the Weinstein treatise. Judge Jack Weinstein was present at the creation of the Rules and before. Though he first made his name in Civil Procedure, while still a young man he joined two of the stalwarts of evidence law, Edmund Morgan and John Maguire, to become the junior— that is, the laboring—author on the oldest textbook in the field. He was a natural selection {{to be a member of}} the Advisory Committee that drafted the Rules. The Rules were finally enacted in 1975, and though handling a full docket on the bench and teaching a full load at Columbia Law School, he was ready: He published his monumental treatise with Margaret Berger the same year. In this Article, I will take another look, more than half a century later, at Judge Weinstein’s most important early contribution to the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearsay.</b> In an article published in 1961, Probative Force of Hearsay, he argued for a more discretionary approach to hearsay, functionally oriented and procedurally sensitive. In early drafts, the Advisory Committee appeared willing to give the trial judge broad discretion over the admissibility of hearsay, much as Judge Weinstein had advocated. But public commentary and congressional resistance resulted in rules that took a more cautious approach: a definition of hearsay followed by a list of exemptions. It was a long list, to be sure, and one that included a matched pair of open-ended residual exceptions. But this approach maintained the essential structure of traditional hearsay law and ensured that much of the work in applying that law would consist of determining the bounds of the enumerated exemptions...|$|E
