5|$|With the {{development}} of modern quantum mechanical theories of electron configurations within atoms, {{it became apparent that}} each period (row) in the table corresponded to the filling of a quantum shell of electrons.

5|$|Improvement of {{neurological}} function usually occurs {{for two or}} {{more years}} after the trauma. For many years {{it was believed that}} recovery was fastest during the first six months, but {{there is no evidence to}} support this. It may be related to services commonly being withdrawn after this period, rather than any physiological limitation to further progress. Children recover better in the immediate time frame and improve for <b>longer</b> <b>periods.</b>|$|E
5|$|Initially making only {{tentative}} forays onto land, tetrapods {{adapted to}} terrestrial environments {{over time and}} spent <b>longer</b> <b>periods</b> away from the water. It {{is also possible that}} the adults started to spend some time on land (as the skeletal modifications in early tetrapods such as Ichthyostega suggests) to bask in the sun close to the water's edge, while otherwise being mostly aquatic.|$|E
5|$|Oceans {{contain the}} {{greatest}} quantity of actively-cycled carbon {{in the world}} and are second only to the lithosphere in the amount of carbon they store. The oceans' surface layer holds large amounts of dissolved organic carbon that is exchanged rapidly with the atmosphere. The deep layer's concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon is about 15 percent higher than that of the surface layer and it remains there for much <b>longer</b> <b>periods</b> of time. Thermohaline circulation exchanges carbon between these two layers.|$|E

5|$|Oddfellows is {{the fourth}} studio album by musical {{supergroup}} Tomahawk. The album {{is the first to}} feature new bass player Trevor Dunn, who has replaced previous member Kevin Rutmanis. Oddfellows was recorded live in the Easy Eye Sound Studio in Nashville, Tennessee, after a brief period of rehearsal. Guitarist Duane Denison favored the location as its cheaper studio costs allowed for <b>longer</b> <b>periods</b> of song-writing.|$|E
5|$|The era {{beginning}} with 1288 {{was characterized by}} <b>longer</b> <b>periods</b> in office. Roland Borsa survived 10 years, while his successor, Ladislaus Kán, lasted 20 years. This apparent stability was the consequence of the weakening of central government under the last two kings of the Árpád dynasty, Ladislaus IV (1272–1290) and Andrew III (1290–1301). Royal power was only restored in the reign of Charles I (1308–1342) who one by one defeated the rebellious noblemen throughout his kingdom.|$|E
5|$|When {{given for}} short periods, {{linezolid}} {{is a relatively}} safe antibiotic. It {{can be used in}} people of all ages and in people with liver disease or poor kidney function. Common side effects with short-term use include headache, diarrhea, rash, and nausea. Serious side effects may include serotonin syndrome, bone marrow suppression, and high blood lactate levels, particularly when used for more than two weeks. If used for <b>longer</b> <b>periods</b> still, it may cause sometimes irreversible nerve damage including optic nerve damage.|$|E

5|$|Artificial {{lighting}} {{of any sort}} was largely absent during the industrial development of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Using candles or oil lamps to illuminate a textile factory was costly, and economically unsound. With the advent of industrial means of production, not only were new textile halls physically larger, but they also had to be lit more brightly for <b>longer</b> <b>periods</b> of time. Driven by great demand, and made possible through Lavoisier's theoretical work regarding the role of oxygen in combustion, {{the end of the}} 18th century saw a continuous series of improvements in lighting technology.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin is a {{first-line}} {{treatment for}} the fever and joint-pain symptoms of acute rheumatic fever. The therapy often lasts for one to two weeks, and is rarely indicated for <b>longer</b> <b>periods.</b> After fever and pain have subsided, the aspirin is no longer necessary, since it does not decrease the incidence of heart complications and residual rheumatic heart disease. Naproxen {{has been shown to}} be as effective as aspirin and less toxic, but due to the limited clinical experience, naproxen is recommended only as a second-line treatment.|$|E
5|$|Compared to Final Fantasy XI, where party-based {{gameplay}} is forefront at all times, the gameplay in XIV is adjusted so {{that players}} {{can go for}} <b>longer</b> <b>periods</b> without joining a party. There is no auto-attack option, with each action needing a manual input while an enemy is targeted. Each action uses up a stamina bar. Through defeating monsters, crafting items, and completing quests, players accumulate EXP which, when a certain threshold is reached, automatically increments the player's level. The player's level affects attributes such as HP (health/hit points), MP (magic/mana points), {{and the number of}} abilities available to them.|$|E

5|$|King Louis XV of France {{stayed in}} the palace from 5 to 10October 1744. Maria Josepha of Saxony, Dauphine of France, spent two nights in the palace from 27 to 29January 1747. Queen Marie Antoinette spent her first night on French soil there on 7 to 8May 1770. In 1805, 1806, and 1809 Emperor Napoleon spent several nights in the palace; his wife, Empress Josephine stayed for <b>longer</b> <b>periods,</b> from September 1805 until January 1806 (Battle of Austerlitz), and from May until July 1809 (Battles of Aspern-Essling and of Battle of Wagram).|$|E
5|$|One {{field study}} found that red wattlebirds foraged for <b>longer</b> <b>periods</b> when nectar {{concentrations}} in flowers were low, and consumed fewer insects at this time. However, {{this could have been}} because the temperature was lower and hence insects were less active. In Gingin, Western Australia, 97% of red wattlebirds at a site of two mixed kangaroo paw species were observed feeding on a single species at its peak flowering: cats paw in August and red-and-green kangaroo paw (A. manglesii) in September, with very few visits to the other species or hybrids.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{evidence}} of this theory is uncovered by examining Twin pregnancies. The main argument is, if there are social behaviors that are inherited and developed before birth, then one should expect twin foetuses to engage {{in some form of}} social interaction before they are born. Thus, ten foetuses were analyzed {{over a period of time}} using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment were that the twin foetuses would interact with each other for <b>longer</b> <b>periods</b> and more often as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance of movements between the co-twins were not accidental but specifically aimed.|$|E
