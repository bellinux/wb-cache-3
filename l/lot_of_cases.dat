25|$|In general, non-medical use of {{morphine}} entails taking more than prescribed or outside of medical supervision, injecting oral formulations, mixing it with unapproved potentiators such as alcohol, cocaine, and the like, or defeating the extended-release mechanism by chewing the tablets or {{turning into a}} powder for snorting or preparing injectables. The latter method can be as time-consuming and involved as traditional methods of smoking opium. This {{and the fact that}} the liver destroys a large percentage of the drug on the first pass impacts the demand side of the equation for clandestine re-sellers, as many customers are not needle users and may have been disappointed with ingesting the drug orally. As morphine is generally as hard or harder to divert than oxycodone in a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases,</b> morphine in any form is uncommon on the street, although ampoules and phials {{of morphine}} injection, pure pharmaceutical morphine powder, and soluble multi-purpose tablets are very popular where available.|$|E
500|$|Of his law {{practice}} in Manchester, Combs later noted: [...] "I {{had too many}} kinfolks and friends in Manchester, and they all expected me to handle things as a favor... Then they'd get their feelings hurt if I charged them. I was taking in a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases,</b> but not sending out many bills." [...] In 1938, Combs accepted an offer from a law school classmate named LeRoy Combs (no relation) to join his father and uncle's law firm in Prestonsburg. Prestonsburg was closer to his wife's home in Knott County. Combs' son Tommy suffered from a form of mental retardation, {{the result of an}} injury sustained at birth. After moving to Prestonsburg, Combs started a class for people with mental retardation, in part so Tommy could attend the class.|$|E

We put no energy into the artwork or into anything. On a lot of songs, there aren’t lyrics! In a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases,</b> we never sat down to write them, because we just wanted {{to get it out of}} the way as fast as possible. So I just sang a lot of gibberish, which makes it really quirky. My favorite is the Japanese translations".|$|E
2500|$|The {{internal}} {{volume of}} the cartridge case, or case capacity, significantly affects the pressure developed during ignition, which significantly affects the velocity of the bullet. [...] Cases from different manufacturers can vary in wall thickness, and as cases are repeatedly fired and reloaded the brass flows up to the neck and is trimmed off, increasing capacity as well as weakening the case. [...] The first step to ensuring consistent case capacity is sorting the cases by headstamp, so each <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> is from the same manufacturer and/or year. [...] A further step would be to then weigh these cases, and sort by case weight.|$|E
2500|$|The {{districts of}} Kohistan, Mahmud Raqi, and Kohband districts, {{all of which}} are Jamiat-i Islami and almost all Tajik, have become {{targeted}} zones of interest for the insurgency. Because they are close enough to Kabul, the militants count attacks there as attacks in Kabul. Whilst the districts of Tagab, Alasay and Nijrab are Hizb-i Islami Gulbuddin supporters and are a mixture of Pashtuns, Tajiks and Pashai. [...] The importance of Kapisa comes as it lies along the approach to the Panjshir River valley and most of the major Jamiat figures have managed to secure wealth and power in the post-2001 Afghanistan, while most of the HiG figures have not. As a result, most of the violence in the area is not actually “Taliban” as we would normally consider it, but HiG fighters (and in a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> petty thugs) calling themselves Taliban.|$|E

Despite causing some severe pathologies, <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> hemolysis do not suppose a health hazard.

2500|$|To be honest, I wasn't {{very smart}} about things. At that stage I was still {{averaging}} 40 after nine Tests {{or so and}} with the Packer players away, {{most of the other}} guys in the Aussie Test team were very new to the team. I thought {{it was up to me}} to compete with the Packer boys. When the Packer catchcry was [...] "Lillee getting wickets and Hookesy clearing pickets" [...] I felt that anyone who was coming to watch me play needed to be entertained. I probably played more aggressively than I should have. My feeling was I wanted to give the crowd something to look at when they came in the gates. I should have been more circumspect. In a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> I was happy to get out for 30 or 40. But I felt we needed to compete with WSC boys.|$|E

40|$|In my diploma thesis I {{decided to}} write about {{relationship}} between society and animals, mostly because I love animals very much. Although slow, I think that relationship between society and animals is changing to better in last few years. In <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> a child is growing up with an animal since his young ages, animals are included in preschool programs in different ways, and not rarely children have animals on visit or even in their own group in kindergarden. Also, in specialized literature, we can find <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> positive influence that an animal has on a child. Changes in last few years also brought more including of animals to man everyday life. In media is more talking about negative attitude towards animals, which I think is really important, because talking and drawing attention to the problem, {{is the only way}} to get rid of it. Nowadays, there is a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> civil initiatives, which are defending animals rights, more popular are also animal assisted therapies. The empirical part is focused on relationship of children towards animals, therefore which animals do they have for pets, which are they scared of and maybe do they search consolation in animals when they are sad? I also wanted to know how preschool teachers help to develop positive relationship of children towards animals. ...|$|R

50|$|An {{important}} distinction when discussing Fairtrade {{is the difference}} between Impact studies and case studies. Case studies are valuable for, among other things, researching specific systems and sub-systems, for constructing models, and for identifying problems. However, the impacts noted cannot be extrapolated generally. For instance, if a hundred dairy farms lose money, {{this does not mean that}} all or most dairy farms do. There are a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>case</b> studies on Fairtrade, but many are erroneously referred to as impact studies.|$|R
40|$|In {{the paper}} first a {{complete}} methodology for {{the estimate of}} air pollutant emissions from forest fire will be presented. Next a specific model and a computer code for the estimate of emissions will be introduced. Finally a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>case</b> studies will be discussed. The methodology for estimate emissions from forest fires was developed {{on the basis of}} the information from EMEP/CORINAIR Task Force on Emission Inventories and, for Particulate Matter with diameter inferior to 10 microns, United States Environmental Protection Agency. The model, Air Fire, allows the estimate of the emissions produced by forest fires. The model is developed in Windows environment with object-oriented Visual Basic language and is available with an ACCESS database. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>case</b> studies will be presented. The model has been used at a national level (for the realization of a national emissions inventory) and at regional level (in the frame of emissions inventories and air quality management plans). At national level in Italy forest fires can contribute up to 4. 5 % of Carbon Monoxide and up to 1 % of Nitrogen Oxides and Carbon Dioxide emissions while, at regional level, forest fires can be up to 5 % of Carbon Monoxide and up to 8 % of Particulate Matter with diameter inferior to 10 microns emissions...|$|R
