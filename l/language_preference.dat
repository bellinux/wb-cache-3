25|$|According to the Statistical Institute of Catalonia, in 2013 the Catalan {{language}} {{is the second}} most commonly used in Catalonia, after Spanish, as a native or self-defining language: 7% of the population self-identifies with both Catalan and Spanish equally, 36.4% with Catalan and 47.5% only Spanish. In 2003 the same studies concluded no <b>language</b> <b>preference</b> for self-identification within the population above 15 years old: 5% self-identified with both languages, 44.3% with Catalan and 47.5 with Spanish. In order to promote use of Catalan, the Generalitat de Catalunya (Catalonia's official Autonomous government) spends part of its annual budget on the promotion of the use of Catalan in Catalonia and in other territories.|$|E
2500|$|In Pakistan, Urdu {{is mostly}} {{learned as a}} second or a third {{language}} as nearly 93% of Pakistan's population has a native language other than Urdu. Despite this, Urdu was chosen as a token of unity and as a lingua franca {{so as not to}} give any native Pakistani <b>language</b> <b>preference</b> over the other. Urdu is therefore spoken and understood by the vast majority in some form or another, including a majority of urban dwellers in such cities as Karachi, Lahore, Okara District, Sialkot, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Multan, Faisalabad, Hyderabad, Peshawar, Quetta, Jhang, Sargodha and Skardu. It is written, spoken and used in all provinces/territories of Pakistan although the people from differing provinces may have different indigenous languages, as {{from the fact that it}} is the [...] "base language" [...] of the country. For this reason, it is also taught as a compulsory subject up to higher secondary school in both English and Urdu medium school systems. This has produced millions of Urdu speakers from people whose native language is one of the State languages of Pakistan such as Standard Punjabi, Pashto, Sindhi, Balochi, Potwari, Hindko, Pahari, Saraiki, Balti, and Brahui who can read and write only Urdu. It is absorbing many words from the regional languages of Pakistan. This variation of Urdu is sometimes referred to as Pakistani Urdu.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the results of}} an empirical investigation of overt language attitudes held by students attending North-West University, South Africa. Attitudes elicited from 325 students with mainly Setswana, Sesotho, Afrikaans and English as home languages are analysed comparatively. The study explores the relationship between <b>language</b> <b>preferences</b> in an educational environment and <b>language</b> <b>preferences</b> in other domains of students' daily lives. The study thus indicates how different languages fulfil different roles in a multilingual university environment. The results presented are compared with findings reported in earlier attitudinal investigations from the Eastern Cape. In addition, a comparative analysis of attitudes by Afrikaans speakers is conducted considering students attending classes at two different campuses of the North-West University. At the traditional Afrikaans university campus, Potchefstroom, students show a higher regard for Afrikaans than students who attend classes at the Vaal Triangle. These findings are used in a discussion of context dependency of overt <b>language</b> <b>preferences...</b>|$|R

30|$|Analysis of {{the results}} {{consisted}} of both qualitative and quantitative approaches. Media mode and <b>language</b> <b>preferences,</b> important information types, and information difficulties were examined descriptively, along with the Chi-square test, which was carried out to confirm dependency on language proficiency and nationality. In some cases, the number of respondents was not high enough to give valid results using the Chi-square test; these cases were not examined in further detail. The open responses of selected respondents were qualitatively analyzed by grouping the responses that focused on media mode and <b>language</b> <b>preferences,</b> information difficulties, and associated approaches and solutions, followed by identification {{of the relationship between}} these items.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The web {{community}} is witnessing {{an increase in}} the amount of avail-able multilingual content and the number of multilingual web users. With this variety, personalized search systems are needed to connect people with relevant content, regardless of the language in which the content is provided, and taking into consideration the user’s <b>language</b> capabilities and <b>preferences.</b> Therefore, search personalization algorithms should be developed with the aspect of multi-linguality in mind, part of which involves understanding the effect of personali-zation algorithms on the user’s search experience. This leads to an important question: given that users come from different linguistic backgrounds and have different <b>language</b> <b>preferences,</b> would personalization benefit all search users in the same way? This paper addresses this question by conducting an experiment to: (1) evaluate the effectiveness of the multilingual personalization algorithms (multilingual user modeling and multilingual result adaptation); and (2) deter-mine whether multilingual personalization algorithms achieve the same degree of effectiveness for users who have different <b>language</b> <b>preferences...</b>|$|R

40|$|Even {{with the}} {{prevalence}} of a global culture, cultural and language barriers continue to present challenges for information professionals. Furthermore, international students are increasingly turning to library instruction classes for discovering library programs and resources. With the presence of cultural and language barriers, information literacy initiatives are forced to address the disparity in cultural displacement. The inclusion of <b>language</b> <b>preferences</b> in library instruction classes and information literacy initiatives would benefit international students and information professionals. The paper demonstrates that language and cultural barriers hinder international students from fully experiencing a library and its resources. Furthermore, this paper shows that limited exposure to library resources affects international students negatively by limiting {{their participation in the}} academic discourse. With a review of relevant literature, this paper calls for the inclusion of <b>language</b> <b>preferences</b> in information literacy initiatives and instruction classes.

These language normalization policies, designed to increase usage of minority languages once repressed under the Francoist dictatorship, {{are part of a}} broader regional nationalist political project in each autonomous community.
