50|$|A 1992 {{planning}} {{study by}} Civil Aviation and Public Works departments identified {{the district of}} Sungai Siring, as a possible airport replacement site. Away from the congested city centre, flight paths would be routed over North Samarinda rather than populous urban areas, enabling efficient round-the-clock operation of multiple runways. The Sungai Siring (SGS) airport master plan was completed in 1995. In 1998, however, the government shelved the project for financial and economic reasons. The Airport <b>Location</b> <b>Study</b> was undertaken by Indonesian consultants. This study came up with four recommended locations for overall strategic development in Samarinda. One of the four assumed a new airport at Makroman; a second assumed a new airport at Palaran; the third assumed a new airport at Sungai Siring; and the fourth assumed a new airport at Bayur. In November 2003 the Governor of Kaltim announced that a decision had been made on the Airport <b>Location</b> <b>Study.</b> The strategy was a replacement airport at Sungai Siring.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of country of birth and <b>location</b> of <b>study</b> on {{immigrants}}' wages in Canada. It compares immigrants from two different regions of birth (Africa and Asia), two main provinces (Ontario and Quebec) and two broad <b>locations</b> of <b>study</b> (Western and non-Western). It appears from the empirical results that the <b>location</b> of <b>study</b> is a significant discriminating factor for immigrants. Those with a Western highest degree fare better in both Quebec and Ontario for both genders. Also, immigrants fare better in Ontario than Quebec. Western-educated immigrants, particularly, men and also African-born women, {{do not have any}} significant wage disadvantages in Ontario when compared to natives. Immigrants of all genders, origins and <b>locations</b> of <b>study</b> are worse off than natives in Quebec (But this conclusion is not robust for Western-educated immigrants).

40|$|ABSTRACT This article {{surveys the}} body of {{investigation}} related {{to the location of}} headquarters and other elite corporate decision-making activities, a research field known as quaternary <b>location</b> <b>studies.</b> The discussion includes four main sections following an introduction. The first reviews the initial development of headquarters location research from the early twentieth century to 1980. The second section discusses contemporary developments and criticisms of the field that have diversified the field beyond its early focus on large-firm headquarters alone to examine the geography of all activities related to corporate decision-making. We posit that incorporation of rapidly-growing firms in quaternary research is a key element of this diversification. The third section examines the possibilities for further headquarters location research by making a connection between decision-making location and the literature of techno-economic paradigms. The article concludes by summarizing {{the current state of the}} field, and argues that a continued diversification of research interests and perspectives is vital to the advancement of quaternary <b>location</b> <b>studies</b> as an important contributor to improved corporate strategies and more effective public policy. ...|$|R

According to the LPC, the Bayview site is the logical long term strategic choice and was the number one stadium location by the City of Ottawa Stadium <b>Location</b> <b>Study.</b> Both of the Conservancy options are planned to be revenue positive {{for the city and}} have zero taxpayer cost. Despite the claims by Conservancy proponents, the Ottawa City Council planning and environment committee was not interested in the plans. The Conservancy's competitive bid was submitted to the City's Procurement Department directly on November 15, 2010 for consideration by Ottawa City Council. Both the outgoing and incoming councillors for the neighbouring Capital Ward have indicated that they want the City to consider the proposal. The LPC argues that the City must, according to procurement rules, study any competing proposal for a sole-source bid for City business.|$|E

40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{complexity}} in defining the boundary, the concept of Economic Zones (EZ) has been evolved as a way forward for {{the government of the}} developing countries for enhancing the national trade. Similarly the recent phenomenon of widespread Public Private Partnership (PPP) practices especially in infrastructure sector is also providing a window to develop many of such economic zones through PPP model as EZ typically is capital intensive.

However, developing EZ under PPP model has few commercial complexities as both the public and private sector need to bear some roles and obligations one of which is selection of appropriate location for EZ development.
