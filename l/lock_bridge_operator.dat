5000|$|The {{bridge is}} {{hydraulically}} controlled. 2 wedge cylinders <b>lock</b> the <b>bridge</b> {{and raise the}} overhanging edge in place at road level. When the bridge is to be opened, from the control box up at bridge deck level, the <b>bridge</b> <b>operator,</b> who is with Parks Canada, lowers all 4 gates to block traffic from entering the <b>bridge</b> deck. The <b>operator</b> withdraws the 2 wedge cylinders which brings the bridge down a few inches and balanced onto a circular rail track. This movement also takes {{the weight of the}} bridge off the West side bridge bearings. Once the limit switches sense the wedge cylinders are fully retracted the operator can swing the bridge which is performed by 2 large hydraulic cylinders below the bridge {{on either side of the}} main bridge spindle. The hydraulic power unit has 2 main pumps which can be run independently or together, and one small backup pump to be run off a generator if need be.|$|R

40|$|In Tor, {{a bridge}} is a client node that volunteers to help censored users access Tor by {{serving as an}} unlisted, first-hop relay. Since {{bridging}} is voluntary, {{the success of this}} circumvention mechanism depends critically on the willingness of clients to act as bridges. We identify three key architectural shortcomings of the bridge design: (1) bridges are easy to find; (2) a bridge always accepts connections when its operator is using Tor; and (3) traffic to and from clients connected to a bridge interferes with traffic to and from the <b>bridge</b> <b>operator.</b> These shortcomings lead to an attack that can expose the IP address of <b>bridge</b> <b>operators</b> visiting certain web sites over Tor.
