40|$|Combined {{visual and}} {{vestibular}} influences on locomotor control, particularly in changing environments, are little understood. We studied such influences on body orientation and foot trajectory control during level walking and obstacle avoidance. Six young adults {{walked on the}} level and over an obstacle while vision was present or occluded as well as while vestibular information was intact or perturbed using galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS). The occlusion of vision caused a slowing of gait during obstacle avoidance {{as well as in}}creased clearance of the leading limb over the obstruction. GVS caused <b>lateral</b> <b>deviations</b> in head and trunk roll angles as well as in foot and trunk displacements, but these <b>lateral</b> <b>deviations</b> were the same during both level walking and obstacle avoidance. In addition, GVS had no effect at all on sagittal plane factors such as speed, foot proximity to the obstacle and vertical clearance over the obstacle. Overall, there is a complex visual control of bilateral obstacle avoidance, but the lack of differences in GVS effects between level and obstructed walking shows that vestibular information is not upregulated for obstacle avoidance. In addition, the robust indifference of anterior foot placement and body displacement to significant <b>lateral</b> <b>deviations</b> from GVS suggests an orthogonally based sensori-locomotor control...|$|R

500|$|The {{following}} Australian {{season he}} became captain of New South Wales following {{the retirement of}} Kippax and the departure of Bradman to South Australia. However, with Australia touring South Africa in 193536, McCabe did not represent his state. However, he was made vice-captain to Vic Richardson for the tour, with Woodfull and Ponsford having retired, and Bradman ill. McCabe enjoyed more success, heading the Test batting figures with 420 runs at 84.00. After scoring 24, 65 and 29 in three warm-up matches, {{all of which were}} won by innings, McCabe hit 149 in the First Test at Durban, sharing a second-wicket partnership of 161 with Bill Brown in gale-force conditions which caused balls to make U-turns in the headwind, forced the umpires to glue the bails to the wickets using chewing gum, to set up a nine-wicket victory. In the following Test in Johannesburg, McCabe made 34 as Australia took a first innings lead of 93. However, Dudley Nourse scored 235 to help the hosts to 491; McCabe removed Nourse and ended with 2/30. Australia were set a Test world record target of 399 in the second innings to achieve victory on a turning wicket, and McCabe told captain Richardson {{that he would not be}} able to bat or run between wickets effectively because of altitude sickness. Regarding McCabe was his most important batsman, Richardson implored him to bat and told him to simply stand his ground and hit boundaries so that he would not have to run. McCabe joined Fingleton at 1/17 before taking the score to 1/85 by the end of the third day. The following morning in poor visibility on a wicket with irregular bounce and <b>lateral</b> <b>deviation,</b> McCabe resumed on 38 and scored a century in the morning session to reach lunch at 138, after Fingleton was dismissed at 2/194. The pair had put on 177 runs for the second wicket, and McCabe had done more than four fifths of the scoring. McCabe had reached his century in only 90 minutes, and continued on despite a storm that brought low dust clouds and hindered visibility, and increasingly irregular bounce and cut off the pitch. Midway through the afternoon, dark clouds gathered, along with thunderstorms and lightning, but this had no effect on the batsman. McCabe pushed the score to 2/274, and with only 125 runs needed with half the day remaining, Australia were on course to meet the target, having already scored 189 in the first half. However, Herbie Wade, the South African captain made an unprecedented appeal against the light due fear [...] "for the fieldsmen's safety" [...] in the face of McCabe's aggressive batting. He finished unbeaten on 189, an innings described by Fingleton as [...] "bordering on miraculous". McCabe struck 24 fours, and was productive square of the wicket, hitting numerous cut shots past point. Fingleton further added that “McCabe never put a foot or his bat in a false position”, and that he “pulverized the South African attack into the dust”. McCabe was unable to maintain such a standard of performance in the remaining three Tests; he scored a duck, 40 and one, as Australia won each by an innings. He ended the series with three wickets at 45.33. However, he scored consecutive centuries in the tour matches, adding 115 and 112 against Border and Orange Free State.|$|E

2500|$|The aim of fast bowling is {{to deliver}} the ball in such a fashion as to cause the batsman to make a mistake. This is {{achieved}} by making the hard cricket ball deviate from a predictable, linear trajectory at a speed that restricts {{the amount of time}} in which the batsman can compensate for it. For deviation caused by the ball's stitching (the seam), the ball will bounce off the pitch and deflect either away from the batsman's body, or inwards towards them. Swing bowlers on the other hand also use the seam of the ball but in a different way. To 'bowl swing' is to induce a curved trajectory of the cricket ball through the air. Swing bowlers use a combination of seam orientation, body position at the point of release, asymmetric ball polishing, and variations in delivery speed to affect an aerodynamic influence on the ball. The ability of a bowler to induce <b>lateral</b> <b>deviation</b> or 'sideways movement' obviously make it difficult for the batsman to address the flight of the ball accurately. [...] Beyond this ability to create an unpredictable path of ball trajectory, the fastest bowlers can be equally potent by simply delivering a ball at such a rate that a batsman simply fails to react either correctly, or at all.

50|$|As an {{aircraft}} nears an NDB station, the ADF becomes increasingly sensitive, small <b>lateral</b> <b>deviations</b> result in large deflections {{of the needle}} which sometimes shows erratic left/right oscillations. Ideally, as the aircraft overflies the beacon, the needle swings rapidly from directly ahead to directly behind. This indicates station passage and provides an accurate position fix for the navigator. Less accurate station passage, passing slightly to one side or another, is shown by slower (but still rapid) swinging of the needle. The time interval from the first indications of station proximity to positive station passage varies with altitude — a few moments at low levels to several minutes at high altitude.|$|R

In this study a tele-steering system for tractor was designed and constructed to controling and steering so the operator can control the tractor even {{far away from the}} stressful condition of tractor cab,. A CCTV camera and an electric motor were used in order to view the path and to rotate the steering shaft accordingly. Bilateral communication between the control center outside the tractor and control unit on the tractor was provided by a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN).

Root mean square of error (RMSE) of <b>lateral</b> <b>deviations</b> and frequency of out of range around the reference route (Nout) were used as criteria in variance analysis. The results for two different ground surfaces with three replications showed that the performance of system had less sensitivity on soil surface and had better stability because of deformable structure and condition of soil compare to asphalt. Steering speed alone had no effect on the accuracy of tractor guidance. This is because the accuracy of the system mainly depends on capability, skillfulness and mental concentration of the operator. The position of the camera installed in front of the tractor had higher accuracy than that of rear camera.

50|$|The project {{started in}} September 1987 with an advance {{borehole}} using {{state of the}} art technology. The borehole reached its target depth of 4,000 metres in April 1989. The results of this drilling were used as parameters for the main borehole - for example the temperature gradient was higher than originally expected. The main drilling started on 8 September 1990 about 200 metres away from the advance borehole for an envisaged depth of 10,000 metres.

Due to the expected failure of the electronics below that depth a conventional drill head was used below that point.
