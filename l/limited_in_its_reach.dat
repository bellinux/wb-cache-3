Fig. 6 is a {{tolerable}} facsimile[36] of {{a little}} chalk sketch of Harding's; quite inimitable in the quantity of life and truth obtained by {{about a quarter of}} a minute's work; but beginning to show the faulty vagueness and carelessness of modernism. The stems, though beautifully free, are not thoroughly drawn or rounded; and in the mass of the tree, though well formed, the tremulousness and transparency of leafage are lost. Nor is it possible, by Harding's manner of drawing, to express such ultimate truths; his execution, which, in its way, no one can at all equal (the best chalk drawing of Calame and other foreign masters being quite childish and feeble in comparison), is yet sternly <b>limited</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>reach,</b> being originally based on the assumption that nothing is to be delicately drawn, and that the method is only good which insures specious incompletion.|$|E

The phrase may be <b>limited</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>reach</b> to State Exchanges. But it could also refer to all Exchanges—both State and Federal—for purposes of the tax credits. If a State chooses not to follow the directive in Section 18031 to establish an Exchange, the Act tells the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish [...] "such Exchange." [...] §18041.

40|$|The {{connections}} between sport and geography are many and varied. This article explores one facet of this {{focusing on the}} increasing number of foreign-born players in football’s Premier League in England. In recent years the league has seen a sizeable influx of players from outside Britain and Ireland, a reflection of an increasingly commercialised game with a global reach. From data on players’ places of birth the internationalisation of the game in England is readily apparent, though distinct spatial patterns are clearly evident. However, as the article shows, when information on where players are purchased from is taken into account it becomes clear that the Premier League is more <b>limited</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> global <b>reach,</b> with the majority of foreign imports being signed from just six western European countries. The flows of migrant footballers appear to be shaped by various networks and channelled through specific routes...|$|R

Lumas Kendrick, of the Inter-American Development Bank states that, of the energy that is generated by the dam, over half is lost due to poor power lines, defective transformers, and billing issues. Of the energy that is generated and distributed, it is <b>limited</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> ability to <b>reach</b> all of Haiti, as only 12 per cent of the country has electrical wires. These areas with electricity are concentrated around urban centers, thereby reducing the overall impact of the hydroelectric power on rural development in the country.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- In today’s {{demanding}} and competitive business environment, {{the need to}} collect, interpret and act on real-time data plays an increasingly vital role. But data collection using typical wired sensor networks has always been expensive to install and maintain, and <b>limited</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>reach.</b> This difficulty can be overcome by using tiny, wireless smart sensors. This Wireless System is a monitoring device that combines a maser controller, one or more sensors, and a radio for transmitting and receiving information. A typical application scenario is scattering a hundred of sensors around a green house or a building or around a hospital to monitor temperature or humidity, track patient movements, or inform of disasters, such as earthquakes. In the military, they can perform as a remote sensor chip to track enemy movements, detect poisonous gas or radioactivity...|$|E

40|$|Poor {{biodistribution}} and {{accumulation of}} chemotherapeutics in tumors due to limitations on diffusive transport and high intra-tumoral pressures (Jain RK, Nat Med. 7 (9) : 987 – 989,  2001) have prompted {{the investigation of}} adjunctive therapies to improve treatment outcomes. Hyperthermia has been widely applied in attempts to meet this need, but it is <b>limited</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> ability to <b>reach</b> tumors in deeply located body regions. High-intensity radiofrequency (RF) electric fields {{have the potential to}} overcome such barriers enhancing delivery and extravasation of chemotherapeutics. However, due to factors, including tumor heterogeneity and lack of kinetic information, there is insufficient understanding of time-resolved interaction between RF fields and tumor vasculature, drug molecules and nanoparticle (NP) vectors. Intravital microscopy (IVM) provides time-resolved high-definition images of specific tumor microenvironments, overcoming heterogeneity issues, and can be integrated with a portable RF device to enable detailed observation over time {{of the effects of the}} RF field on kinetics and biodistribution at the microvascular level. Herein, we provide a protocol describing the safe integration of IVM with a high-powered non-invasive RF field applied to 4 T 1 orthotopic breast tumors in live mice. Results show increased perfusion of NPs in microvasculature upon RF hyperthermia treatment and increased perfusion, release and spreading of injected reagents preferentially in irregular vessels during RF exposure...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues for}} the re-introduction of drawing across the {{university}} sector. It also posits that modern university education is too <b>limited</b> <b>in</b> the <b>its</b> educational <b>reach</b> across intelligences, focused {{as it is}} on textural and logical-mathematical systems of assessment, communication, unit coursework and expected outcomes. The argument for the re-introduction of drawing is also a call for the development, use and study of studio-based education in the tertiary sector. The skills and knowledge acquired in a studio are particularly pertinent to scientific study; being a range of skills and knowledge too often neglected, through the over-use and reliance on digital technology. It must always be remembered that undergraduate students, by and large, are young, often naive and have limited physical, hand,-eye, visual or intrapersonal skills or experience. That is not to say they are unintelligent, but their experience and knowledge is limited, a lack of knowledge and understandings too often forgotten by course writers. Students come to university to learn, but the academy is still caught up in presenting information, a commodity easily acquired in the present on-line, globalized climate. What students lack are observational and spatial skills, analytical and comprehension skills, hand-eye and visual intelligence and knowledge and the ability to communicate verbally and visually, outside of the realms of the computer. Drawing and studio work are both focused on the utilization of multi-intelligence learning. If drawing and studio work were re-introduced into the general tertiary curricula then universities would be graduating much more rounded, more broadly educated and more adaptable graduates and in the end, better scientists...|$|R

The paper is of the view that Nigeria requires a system that will insulate education from unnecessary politicization. Education formulation and policy consideration should be for the good of all. The paper is also of the view that there is need for a holistic reorientation, re-engineering and re-branding of education, especially teacher training and recruitments, if effective quality of education is to be achieved in Nigeria. Government should also ensure that all reports, pronouncements and positions canvassed by educational accreditation, visitations and probe panels are implemented...|$|E
40|$|The {{preceding}} chapter {{summarized the}} main features of low-wage work across our six countries. In this chapter and the next, we attempt to explain the main institutional determinants of the size and nature of low-wage work in each country. In this chapter, we focus on national institutions involved in setting workers' pay. In the next chapter, we complement our analysis of pay-setting with a review of national institutions that affect labor supply, including unemployment benefits and other income support programs, education and training policy, and immigration. The results of the case studies suggest that “pay-setting institutions” {{play a central role}} in explaining international differences in low-wage work. By pay-setting institutions, we refer to the formal and sometimes informal mechanisms used to determine the wages (and benefits) received by workers in different industries and occupations within each country. More specifically, we mean collective-bargaining arrangements, minimum wages, and other labor and product market legislation, regulations, and procedures that have an impact on wage determination. Our review of national pay-setting institutions has two main findings. First, the prevalence of low-wage work appears to be strongly related to the "inclusiveness" of national pay-setting institutions. The more "inclusive" the pay-setting institutions, the lower the prevalence of low-wage work. The most inclusive systems use centralized and coordinated national collective bargaining agreements to extend the wage gains of the most powerful, generally unionized, workers to those workers with less bargaining power, especially less-skilled and fnon-union workers. Some countries, meanwhile, provide a degree of inclusiveness through a national minimum wage that extends a wage floor below workers who would otherwise have little ability to secure higher wages. The least inclusive countries, such as the United States, rely on largely unregulated market forces to set wages. The second key finding of our pay-setting analysis is the important role played by employer "exit options" [...] de jure or de facto exemptions, exceptions, or loopholes in otherwise inclusive pay-setting institutions. Non-standard work contracts, for example, may fall outside of national collective bargaining agreements, allowing employers to set low wages even in countries with extensive collective bargaining. Lax enforcement of existing labor law, particularly in contexts where there is little or no union oversight, can provide another exit option for firms seeking to cut labor costs. Gender, ethnicity, national origin, region of residence, and other factors all play a role in explaining differences in wages paid across industry and occupation, but we concentrate here on institutional structures that are explicitly designed to determine what workers earn. The most important of these institutions in most of our countries is the national system of collective bargaining. The national minimum wage is probably the next most important national pay-setting institution, and is particularly important in countries where collective bargaining is <b>limited</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>reach.</b> We also stress that a largely unregulated competitive labor market is a key pay-setting institution, with important implications for the prevalence of low-wage work, particularly in the absence of strong collective bargaining or a binding national minimum wage. Two less obvious pay-setting institutions are non-standard work arrangements (such as part-time and temporary work) and product-market regulations. The many complex and evolving forms of non-standard work arrangements grant different rights and responsibilities to firms and workers, frequently shifting the relative bargaining power of employers and employees with direct effects on low-wage work. Efforts to open product markets to national and international competition often increase competitive pressures on national workers, especially by putting national workers in direct competition with workers from other countries. The rest of this chapter looks, in turn, at the "inclusiveness" of collective bargaining arrangements and national minimum wages; non-standard work arrangements and product-market deregulation as opportunities for "exit options" from the generally more inclusive national pay-setting systems; and, finally, at issues related to pay-setting at the firm level...|$|E
40|$|The {{preceding}} chapter {{summarized the}} main features of low-wage work across our six countries. In this chapter and the next, we explain the main institutional determinants of the size and structure of low-wage work, focusing on the national institutions involved in setting pay. The overall incidence of low pay in the six countries {{and the results of}} the case studies suggest that pay-setting institutions {{play a central role in}} explaining international differences in low-wage work. By "pay-setting institutions" we mean the formal and sometimes informal mechanisms used to determine the wages (and benefits) received by workers in different industries and occupations within each country. More specifically, we mean collective bargaining arrangements, minimum wages, and other labor and product market legislation, regulations, and procedures that have an impact on wage determination. These institutions, with their mutual linkages, may form "inclusive" or "exclusive" pay-setting systems. In exclusive systems, the pay and other terms and conditions of employees with strong bargaining power have little or no effect on employees with weaker bargaining power within a company, within an industry, or across industries. Inclusive systems extend the benefits of such bargaining power to workers who have relatively little bargaining power in their own right. The more inclusive the set of institutions, the better protected are those at the low end of the workforce. Inclusiveness does not depend just on the formal institutions but also on the extent to which the various players are committed to reducing inequality. Our review of national pay-setting institutions has two main findings. First, the prevalence of low-wage work appears to be strongly related to the inclusiveness of national pay-setting institutions. The more inclusive the pay-setting institutions, the lower the prevalence of low-wage work. The most inclusive systems use centralized and coordinated national collective bargaining agreements to extend the wage gains of the most powerful, generally unionized, workers to those workers with less bargaining power, especially less-skilled and non-union workers. Some countries, meanwhile, provide a degree of inclusiveness through a national minimum wage that positions a wage floor below workers who would otherwise have little ability to secure higher wages. The least inclusive countries, such as the United States, rely on largely unregulated market forces to set wages, and in contrast to many European governments, in the past the U. S. government has not been committed to increasing the statutory minimum wage. The second key finding is the important role played by employer "exit options"-the de jure or de facto exemptions, exceptions, or loopholes in otherwise inclusive pay-setting institutions. For example, where nonstandard work contracts or workers in small and medium-sized companies fall outside national collective bargaining agreements, employers are able to set low wages, even in countries with extensive collective bargaining. Lax enforcement of existing labor law, particularly in contexts where there is little or no union oversight, provides another exit option for firms seeking to cut labor costs. The most vulnerable workers in the five industries we studied were most affected by these exit options. Gender, ethnicity, national origin, region of residence, and other factors all play a role in explaining differences in the wages paid across industries and occupations, but we concentrate here on institutional features that have an impact on workers' bargaining power and therefore help to determine what they earn-and also, potentially, other dimensions of their job quality. The most important of these institutions in most of our countries is the national system of collective bargaining. The national minimum wage is probably the next most important national pay-setting institution, particularly in countries where collective bargaining is <b>limited</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>reach.</b> Employment protection legislation (EPL) and, more widely, the regulations concerning the rights attached to different employment statuses (permanent and temporary) also influence workers' bargaining power, as do product market regulations. Efforts to open product markets to national and international competition often increase competitive pressures on workers, especially by putting them in direct competition with workers from other countries or with companies not covered by collective agreements within the same country. Finally, two dimen sions of wage setting at the level of the firm or organization have to be taken into account. The first relates to nonwage benefits, many of which are fixed in some countries by law or by collective agreement (and therefore are not dependent on employers' discretion). Such benefits constitute a kind of minimum "social wage" (see also chapter 2). The second dimension relates to institutions promoting employees' representation and voice at the organizational level. The rest of this chapter looks at the inclusiveness of collective bargaining arrangements and national minimum wages; at nonstandard work arrangements and product market deregulation as opportunities for exit options from the generally more inclusive national paysetting systems; and finally, at issues related to pay setting at the firm level through "social wages" and employee voice.
