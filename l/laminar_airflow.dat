40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine whether dimples on a heat sink fin can increase heat transfer for <b>laminar</b> <b>airflows.</b> This was accomplished by performing experimental studies using {{two different types of}} dimples: 1) circular (spherical) dimples, and 2) oval (elliptical) dimples. Dimples were placed on both sides of a aluminium plate with a relative pitch of S/D= 1. 21 and relative depth of δ/D= 0. 16 (e. g., circular dimples). For oval dimples, similar ratios with the same total depth and circular-edge-to-edge distance as the circular dimples were used. For those configurations the average heat transfer coefficient, pressure drop, thermal performance and Nusselt number ratio were determined experimentally. For circular and oval dimples, heat transfer enhancements (relative to a flat plate) were observed for Reynolds number range from 600 to 2000 (Reynolds number based on channel height). Also the results are validated analytically for Nusselt number and friction factor for plain vertical plate. This experiment was undertaken to provide the needed experimental data that fill the gap for the use of dimples for laminar flow conditions. Specifically, this {{investigation was}} conducted {{to determine whether or not}} the use of dimples can enhance heat transfer characteristics for heat sink applications.

The difference between humans and apes toward the adaptability to the living environment is caused by the difference among both bodies’ biological functions such as the nasal cavity biological function. Indeed, the temperature and the humidity of the inhaled air are adjusted by the heat and the water exchange in the nasal cavity wall's surface. In order to understand the nasal cavity functions for the adjustment of the temperature and the humidity of the inhaled air, it is necessary to know the flow distribution during breathing process. To do so, a noninvasive measurement is hard to be held. Therefore, this study simulates a <b>laminar</b> steady <b>airflow,</b> in a realistic adult male chimpanzee's nasal cavity shape reconstructed from Computed Tomography (CT) images, using CFD.

The measuring of the emission potential of gaseous substances (NH 3, CO 2, N 2 O and CH 4) is difficult {{because of the size}} of the outdoor yards and the direct access by climate. One possibility to measure those emissions is the use of an active sampling hood. The sampling hood provides defined <b>laminar</b> exhaust <b>airflow.</b> The product of flow rate and concentration results in the emission mass flow. In a preliminary study six cattle in calf with a total of 7. 19 GV had access to an outdoor yard. This was divided virtually in a 9 x 11 à 1 m² grid. To each m² a dirt level (clean, slightly, medium and heavily soiled) has been assigned. The grid area was sampled randomly. The influence of a scraper was investigated, too. The levels of dirtiness were allocated to the NH 3 emission mass flows. Based on the rating the results of the random samples were transferred on the partial area of the entire outdoor yard. The outcome of this is an emission factor for NH 3 of 3. 02 kg/GV*a for the outdoor yard before the scraper was used and 2. 79 kg/GV*a afterwards.

40|$|The nasal {{physiological}} functions of pollutant filtration and olfaction {{are dependent on}} airflow and mass transport processes. To analyze the transport phenomena, an anatomically correct finite element model of a human nasal cavity was constructed using coronal CAT scan images of a healthy adult nose. ^ The steady-state equations of motion were solved to determine <b>laminar</b> nasal <b>airflow</b> patterns at quiet breathing flow rates. In the main nasal passages, the highest air speed occurred along the nasal floor and a second lower peak occurred between the inferior and middle turbinates. The air-stream entering the anterior tip of the naris traveled to the olfactory slit, without forming separated recircultating zones. About 10 % of the inspiratory volumetric flow passed through the olfactory airway, and remained nearly constant with variation in flow rate. The numerical velocity field was validated by comparison with experimentally measured velocities {{in a large scale}} physical model, that was built by scaling up from the same CAT scans. ^ The uncoupled convective-diffusion equation was solved using the velocity field, to determine uptake of inhaled vapors and ultrafine particles. A wall boundary condition was developed that included the effects of vapor solubility in a mucus layer, diffusion and chemical reaction in the mucus, and epithelial membrane permeability. The maximum absorption efficiency (fractional uptake) of the nasal cavity, up to the posterior end of the turbinates, was about 80 %. The maximum flux in the main nasal passages occurred on the anterior-inferior end of the middle turbinate, which is a common location for pollutant-induced nasal lesions. ^ The mass transfer model was used to determine uptake of inspired odorants on the olfactory mucosa. Total olfactory flux, that is correlated with perceived odor intensity, was less than 5 % of total flux over the entire nasal surface. Different odorants generated discernibly different flux patterns across the olfactory mucosa, that may serve to encode odor quality. Total, peak, and patterns of flux, on the olfactory mucosa and the entire nasal surface, were dependent on the physiochemical properties of the inhaled spices (which determine the wall boundary condition) and the nasal flow rate. ...|$|R

The {{understanding}} and quantitative description of fluid flowthrough porousmedia, {{is a science}} which {{has been going on}} for many years and investigated in a variety of disciplines. Studies in this field have primarily been based on models, which can either be described as empirical or theoretical. Part of the current study is to understand fluid flow in porous media through studying three recent theoretical pore-scale models based on the concept of a Representative Unit Cell (RUC), to represent a porous medium. Amongst other assumptions, these models assumed plane Poiseuille flow throughout each pore section of a rectangular RUC. The main objective of this study is to numerically verify this assumption using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software, FLUENT version 6. 2. 16. Attention is also paid to comparison between these models with the experimental data, obtained during the model tests of airflow through a timber stack end, undertaken in a wind tunnel. The <b>laminar</b> and intermediate <b>airflow</b> through a timber stack end is simulated using the commercial software FLUENT, and the results are validated against the theoretical pore-scale models and experimental data.

The goal of {{this project}} has been to create and develop a {{computational}} and mathematical model of a lung with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) that is clinically useful in diagnosing and treating CF patients. This research is the first attempt to parameterize the distributions of mucus in a CF lung {{as a function of}} time. By default the model makes arbitrary choices at each stage of the construction process, whereby the simplest choice is made. The model is sophisticated enough to fit the average CF patients' spirometric data over time and to identify several interesting parameters: probability of colonization, mucus volume growth rate and scarring rate. Furthermore, modeling some of the spirometric measures requires a full understanding of the flow characteristics through the laminar, transitional, and turbulent regions of human lung. In this thesis we also describe the airfow dynamics mathematically by considering the resistance from both <b>laminar</b> and turbulent <b>airflow</b> throughout the entire respiratory tract. Assuming a rigid airway structure, we implement a model that measures airway clogging in CF lung and recalculate the rate of air flow after these obstructions. In addition, we use the MRI and spirometric data of a patient to spatially track the presence, growth, and clearing of infections. Finally, to complement our developed models and to provide a clinically useful tool, we implement a Graphical User Interface for the models that enables medical doctors to interact with the simulation and tailor their treatment based on contrasts between predicted and observed scenarios...|$|R
40|$|The {{convective}} {{mass transfer}} coefficient is determined for evaporation in a horizontal rectangular duct, which forms the test {{section of the}} transient moisture transfer (TMT) facility. In the test facility, a short pan is situated in the lower panel of the duct where a hydrodynamically fully developed <b>laminar</b> or turbulent <b>airflow</b> passes {{over the surface of}} the water. The measured convective mass transfer coefficients have uncertainties that are typically less than ± 10 % and are presented for Reynolds numbers (ReD) between 560 and 8, 100, Rayleigh numbers (RaD) between 6, 100 and 82, 500, inverse Graetz numbers (Gz) between 0. 003 and 0. 037, and operating conditions factors (H*) between - 3. 6 and - 1. 4. The measured convective mass transfer coefficients are found to increase as ReD, RaD, Gz and H* increase and these effects are included in the Sherwood number (ShD) correlations presented in this thesis, which summarize the experimental data. An analogy between heat and mass transfer is developed to determine the convective heat transfer coefficients from the experimentally determined ShD correlations. The convective heat transfer coefficient is found to be a function of ShD and the ratio between heat and moisture transfer potentials (S*) between {{the surface of the water}} and the airflow in the experiment. The analogy is used in the development of a new method that converts a pure heat transfer NuD (i. e., heat transfer with no mass transfer) and a pure mass transfer ShD (i. e., mass transfer with no heat transfer) into NuD and ShD that are for simultaneous heat and mass transfer. The method is used to convert a pure heat transfer NuD from the literature into the NuD and ShD numbers measured in this thesis. The results of the new method agree within experimental uncertainty bounds, while the results of the traditional method do not, indicating that the new method is more applicable than the traditional analogy between heat and mass transfer during simultaneous heat and mass transfer. A numerical model is developed that simulates convective heat and mass transfer for a vapor permeable Tyvek® membrane placed between an airflow and liquid water. The boundary conditions imposed on the surfaces of the membrane within the model are typical of the conditions that are present within the TMT facility. The convective heat and mass transfer coefficients measured in this thesis are applied in the model to determine the heat and moisture transfer through the membrane. The numerical results show that the membrane responds very quickly to a step change in temperature and relative humidity of the air stream. Since the transients occur over a short period of time (less than 1 minute), it is feasible to use a steady-state model to determine the heat and mass transfer rates through the material for HVAC applications. The TMT facility is also used to measure the heat and moisture transfer through a vapor permeable Tyvek® membrane. The membrane is in contact with a water surface on its underside and air is passed over its top surface with convective boundary conditions. The experimental data are used to verify the numerically determined moisture transfer rate through the Tyvek® membrane. The numerical model is able to determine the mass transfer rates for a range of testing conditions within ± 26 % of the experimental data. The differences between the experiment and the model could be due to a slightly different mass transfer coefficient for flow over Tyvek® than for flow over a free water surface...|$|R
