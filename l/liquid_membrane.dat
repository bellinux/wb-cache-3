40|$|Membrane {{processes}} {{provide a}} relatively new and economically attractive separation technique. One type of membrane processes, i. e. the use of facilitated transport in <b>liquid</b> <b>membranes,</b> is particularly attractive.

In spite of their clear advantages are SLMs not used on an industrial scale nowadays. The main reason for this is their lack of stability and subsequently short lifetime.

40|$|Abstract: Supported <b>liquids</b> <b>membranes</b> {{are very}} {{promising}} products. They have been intensively inves-tigated in {{last two decades}} and widely used in many technologies especially in gas separation and purifi-cation processes. A key aspect in obtaining satisfying effectiveness and long membrane lifetime is a proper choice of ionic liquid and polymeric or ceramic support. Properties of both affect the processes of obtaining useful supported ionic <b>liquid</b> <b>membranes.</b> In comparison to polymeric membranes, ceramic ones are slightly thicker, however they are thermally and mechanically more stable. Our research was aimed at sintering fine glass particles of 500 to 45 µm in size in order to prepare porous membranes {{which can be used}} as supports for <b>liquid</b> <b>membranes.</b> Dextrin and borax were used as pore-making agents. The membranes, as disks 35 mm in diameter and 3 mm of thickness, were prepared. The porosity was determined using absorption method.

The use of SLMs, in which an extraction liquid containing a carrier is immobilized in the pores of a microporous support, has recently been introduced as a promising new separation technique.
