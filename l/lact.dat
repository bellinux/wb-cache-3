5000|$|In its {{complaint}} against {{the oil companies}}, the state said the oil companies were interpreting the phrase [...] "at the well" [...] incorrectly and were thus violating {{the terms of the}} Prudhoe Bay lease agreement. This {{came to be known as}} the [...] "where" [...] argument. At Prudhoe Bay, crude oil comes out of the ground thick, under great pressure, and mixed with substances including water, butane and pentane. During the crude oil production process, the pressure must be reduced and suspended substances must be removed. Only once this has taken place does the oil enter the Trans-Alaska Pipeline system at Pump Station No. 1. At the pump station are [...] "Lease Automatic Custody Meters" [...] that measure the flow through the pipeline. The state argued that the proper place to measure the royalty oil was at the <b>LACT</b> meters, after it had been purified and readied for transport. This oil was worth more than the raw crude oil, and the oil companies favored a measuring point before purification. Such a measurement would lower their royalty payments to the state because the oil would be worth less.|$|E

The possible mechanisms underlying {{myocardial infarction}} with normal coronary arteries coronary vasospasm, thrombosis, embolization or minimal atherosclerosis. ObservationA 36 -year-old <b>lacting</b> women was admitted to our center with constrective chest pain lasting for more than 30 minutes. She was a passive smoker and had no other risk factors for CAD, no prior history of chest pain and the family history was negative. Cardiovascular examination revealed no abnormal heart sound, gallop or murmur. The initial electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm with negative T waves in anterior leads. The occurence of myocardial infarction was confirmed by elevation of cardiac troponin. She was treated conventionally. The normokinesis of all wall motion has been shon by echocardiography, with normal left ventricular function. Coronary angiography revealed an occlusion of the left anterior descending artery, avoided by nitrate intracoronary. Coronary spasm was suspected and she was started on calcium blockers. Two weeks after, contro coronary angiography revealed normal coronary arteries. ConclusionCoronary artery spasm {{has been shown to}} cause myocardial infarction in patients with normal coronary arteries. Vasospasm can cause vascular endothelial injury leading to platelet aggregation and coagulation system activation with resultant thrombosis and myocardial infarction.

40|$|Aims: This study {{evaluated}} the aerobic and respiratory metabolism in Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus spicheri, two heterofermentative species used in sourdough fermentation. Methods and Results: In silico genome analysis, production of metabolites andgene expression of pyruvate oxidase, pyruvate dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase were assessed in anaerobic and aerobic cultures of <b>Lact.</b> reuteri and <b>Lact.</b> spicheri. Respiring homofermentative Lactobacillus casei N 87 and <b>Lact.</b> rhamnosus N 132 {{were used for}} comparison. Aerobiosis and respiration increased the biomass production of heterofermentative strains compared to anaerobic cultivation. Respiration led to acetoin production by <b>Lact.</b> rhamnosus and <b>Lact.</b> casei, but not in heterofermentative strains, in which lactate and acetate were the major endproducts.

The mean of viable cell counts of microorganisms in Laban was 6. 4 x 10 ⁸ cfu/ml. The 60 strains of {{lactic acid bacteria}} and 24 strains of yeasts were isolated and identified. The percentages of strains on lactic acid bacteria flora were as follows: Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis① was dominant in 88 %. Lc. lactis subsp. lactis②，Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides，and Leuc. lactis were in 5 ， 5 ，and 2 %，respectively. It was recognized that the some characteristics of Lc. lactis subsp. lactis① of the dominant strain were {{different from those of}} Lc. lactis subsp. lactis②. The percentages of strains on yeast flora were as follows: Trichosporon sericeum， Saccharomyces cerevisiae，and Candida kefyr were dominant in 34 ， 21 ，and 21 %，respectively. In addition S. pastorianus，C. versatilis，C. pseudotropicalis，and Zygosaccharomyces microellipsoides were in 8 ， 8 ， 4 ，and 4 %，respectively. It was recognized that the single culture ofS. cerevisiae did not produce ethanol in 10 % reconstituted skimmilk，but otherwise the mixed culture of the strains together with lactic acid bacteria produced it in 10 % reconstituted skimmilk. The Laban were manufactured by using the several mixed cultures of 4 strains of lactic acid bacteria and 2 strains of yeasts isolated from Laban in Yemen. The each mixed cultures were inoculated in 10 % reconstituted skimmilk，and were incubated at 30 ℃，for 1 ~ 5 days. It was found that the rheological scores (G'，G" and G*) of the curds increased and the flavor of those were more desirable in the Laban manufactured by the incubation at 30 ℃， 4 days. イエメンでウシまたはヒツジの乳で製造される伝統的 自然発酵乳ラバン(Laban) の乳酸菌および酵母の菌叢 を調べた。ラバンの生菌数は平均 6. 4 X 10 ⁸ cfu/mlであ った。分離した乳酸菌は 60 菌株，酵母は 24 菌株であった。 ラバン中の乳酸菌菌叢は 2 属 3 菌種 4 グループに分 類され，優勢菌株としてLactococcus lactis subsp. <b>lacts</b> ①が 88 %を占め，その他はLc. lactis subsp. lactis②が 5 %，Leuconostoc mensenteroides subsp. mesenteroidesが 5 %およびLeuconostoc mesenteroidesが 2 %の構成であった。Lc. laclis subsp. lactis②は，優勢な菌株のLc. lactis subsp. lactis①と数種類の糖の発酵性および資化性が異なっていたので区分して分類した。 また酵母菌叢は 4 属 7 菌種に分類され，主要な菌種 はTrichosporon sericeumの 34 %，Saccharomyces cerevisiaeの 21 %およびCandida kefyrの 21 %であり，その 他はS. pastorianusが 8 %，C. versatilisが 8 %，C. pseudotropicalisが 4 %およびZygosaccharomyces microellipsoidesが 4 %の構成であった。 ラバン中に含まれるS. cerevisiaeは，乳中で単一菌株 のみではエタノール発酵を行わなかったが，乳酸菌との 共生によってエタノールを発酵したので，ラバンの風味 形成に関与していることが推定された。 ラバンから分離した乳酸菌 4 菌種と酵母 2 菌種を用 いて， 10 %還元脱脂乳で 30 ℃， 5 日間の混合培養を行 い，ラバンを試作した。培養 4 日後にカードの粘弾性 (G'， G"およびG*) は増加し，良好な風味を形成するこ とが認められた。[URL]...|$|R
40|$|Aims: Members of the Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus plantarum {{groups are}} capable of aerobic and {{respiratory}} growth. However, they grow poorly in aerobiosis in the currently available chemically defined media, suggesting that aerobic and respiratory growth require further supplementation. Methods and Results: The effect of Tween 80, l-alanine, l-asparagine, l-aspartate, l-proline and l-serine on anaerobic and respiratory growth of <b>Lact.</b>  casei N 87 was investigated using a 25 factorial design. The effectiveness of modified CDM (mCDM) was validated on 21 strains of <b>Lact.</b>  casei and <b>Lact.</b>  plantarum groups. Tween 80 supplementation did not affect anaerobic growth, but improved respiratory growth. l-asparagine, l-proline and l-serine were stimulatory for respiring cells, while the presence of l-aspartate, generally, impaired biomass production. mCDM promoted the growth of <b>Lact.</b>  casei and <b>Lact.</b>  plantarum, with best results for strains showing a respiratory phenotype. Conclusions: The nutritional requirements of anaerobic and respiratory cultures {{of members of the}} <b>Lact.</b>  casei and <b>Lact.</b>  plantarum groups differ. Tween 80 and selected amino acids derived from pathways related to TCA cycle, pyruvate conversion and NADH recycling are required for respiration. Significance and Impact of the Study: The availability of mCDM will facilitate the study of aerobic metabolism of lactobacilli under controlled conditions...|$|E
40|$|Aims: The {{ability of}} two {{different}} Lactobacillus strains (Lactobacillus salivarius CECT 5713 and Lactobacillus fermentum CECT 5716), isolated from human breast milk, to modulate the immune response was examined. Methods and Results: In rodent bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM), the presence of <b>Lact.</b> fermentum CECT 5716 induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, {{in contrast to the}} activation of IL- 10 induced by <b>Lact.</b> salivarius CECT 5713. Although both strains reduced the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced inflammatory response in BMDM, the effect of <b>Lact.</b> salivarius CECT 5713 was more efficient, probably because of the production of higher amounts of IL- 10 cytokine. In vivo assays in mice showed similar results; the consumption of <b>Lact.</b> fermentum CECT 5716 enhanced the production of Th 1 cytokines by spleen cells and increased the IgA concentration in faeces. However, the consumption of <b>Lact.</b> salivarius CECT 5713 induced IL- 10 production by spleen cells. Conclusion: Therefore, in general, the effect of <b>Lact.</b> fermentum CECT 5716 is immunostimulatory in contrast to the anti-inflammatory effect of <b>Lact.</b> salivarius CECT 5713. Significance and Impact of the Study: The results of this study show that two Lactobacillus strains isolated from breast milk can exert different and even opposing effects on immune response demonstrating the specificity of each strain...|$|E

40|$|Sicily, {{due to its}} millenarian {{history and}} radicated traditions, results one of the regions with an {{elevated}} variety of tipic cheeses. Lactic acid bacteria that are present into this variety of products play a fundamental role {{during the process of}} cheese making. This kind of lactic acid bacteria are now increasingly studied for their production of inhibitory-activity substances: the bacteriocines. The term “bacteriocine” generally indicates the proteinaceous molecules bacteria produced that are generated by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterias, and with an inhibitory-activity against bacteria strains that are different from the producer one. The research in the present study aims to identificate lactic-bacteria strains that are isolated by the traditional Sicilian cheeses and that result bacteriocine-producing. The identification of the bacteria has been effectuated by mean of the sequencing of gene 16 rRNA, starting from the ampliconi obtained by the primer ITS for / ITS rev. The determination of the bacteriocine production, using the agar-spot test method, has been effectuated on 100 of the isolated and identificated strains. The bacteriocine resulted has been characterized through the identification of the title (expressed in AU/ml), through the trial at different temperatures and ph values, and through the trial of sensibility to enzymes. The results shown a little heterogeneity of the Lactococcus and Enterococcus species and, by contrast, an elevated presence of different species of Lactobaccilus. The batteriocine production has been found only for one strain (n. 124) of the Lactococcus <b>lacts</b> subsp. Lactis specie and for the indicator bacteria Staphylococcus aureus. The characterization tests have shown that the bacteriocine produced is heat-stable, and belongs so to Group II, and that it maintains its inhibitory activity in a large range of idrogenionic concentration; it also has a proteic nature, because it is inhibited by the proteolitic enzymes by wich it has been tested. The results is the wished one, because among the analyzed strains, it had been noted that it is the Lactococcus lactis. Subsp. Lactis that fits the required characteristics. The individuated batteriocine results, infact, heath-stable and is it thus possible to use it on different temperatures of lavoration: for the productive process of row milk (e. g. caciotta) and of the stretched cheese (e. g. caciocavallo of Palermo), too. This purpose was born from the willing to analyze the possibility that the producer strain may be utilized ad an autocton starter, preserving the qualitative chataceristics of the product, and to analyze also the possibility to find an antagonist of the patogena microflora...|$|R
40|$|On {{dairy farms}} the {{tradition}} are {{to take the}} calf away from its mother directly after birth and bucket feed it. This model often leads to abnormal behaviours of the calves. To make the environment for the animals better {{and to ensure that}} the consumers get a product that is produced in an ethical way, the calves could be allowed to suckle. This work includes a summary of literature that deals with natural behaviour of cattle and effects of allowing the calf to suckle. It also includes own studies made on Ekenäs ecological farm, near Flen, where they allowed the dairy calves suckle. The calves suckle their own dam for the first three weeks and thereafter unfamiliar cows up to ten weeks of age. The studies were made during the autumn 1995. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe how the cows and calves behaved in this system and its effects on growth, udder health and milk production, identify problems and suggest changes. Behavioural observations were made on six calves and their damd during the first and the 12 :th day after they were moved from their individual calving pen to the early <b>lacting</b> cow group (HG) in the uninsolated barn. After three weeks together with their own dam in the HG the calve was separated from its mother and moved to a group of cows that were in the end of their lactation (LG). The calves were studied the first and 7 :th day in this group. The calves were weighed regularly and their mothers were control milked during the period. In HG almost every suckling was in the opposite parallel position. They suckled on average 6, 25 times/ 19 h and each suckling bout lasted on average 6, 4 min. In HG the dam initiated more suckling bouts than did the calf but the calves terminated more suckling bouts. In LG the calves suckled 9, 8 times/ 19 h and the calves initiated all of the suckling bouts. When the suckling bout ended it was difficult to see if it was the aggression of the cow that finally got the intended effect or if the calf was satisfied The number of attempts (initiations that never led to a suckling bout) was higher in LG than in HG and more of them ended because of the cows aggressive behaviour against the calf. In HG there was only one cross-suckling (the calf suckled an alien cow) and that lasted only for 4 minutes. In LG the calves suckled on several cows. The cows produced on average 11, 1 l/ day when the calves were together with them and suckled and 19, 5 l/day after the separation. The daily weight gain of the calves was 627 g in HG and 854 g in LG. The conclusions of the study is that it was peaceful in HG but very restless in LG therfore it is suggested to have all lactating cows in one group resulting in that the calves can suckle the dam until weaning. In this way there would be less transfer of animals, more peaceful groups and less disturbed suckling bouts...|$|R
40|$|Resumo: O {{melanoma}} é, dentre as neoplasias de pele, a de pior prognóstico devido ao seu alto índice de metástases. A ácido graxo sintase (FAS) é uma enzima metabólica formada por um homodímero com massa molecular aproximada de 250 kDa responsável pela síntese de ácidos graxos saturados de cadeia longa. Sua expressão é baixa em tecidos normais e alta em muitos tumores malignos, nos quais parece estar associada com um pior prognóstico para o paciente, como ocorre nos melanomas. Existem evidências que, nas células malignas, a atividade de FAS é necessária para a produção de fosfolipídios que compõem as membranas celulares. Inibidores específicos da atividade de FAS bloqueiam a síntese de DNA e causam apoptose em linhagens celulares derivadas de neoplasias malignas de próstata, mama e cólon. A droga Orlistat (Xenical®), usada para tratamento de obesidade, foi recentemente descrita como tendo propriedades anti-neoplásicas em câncer de próstata e mama, devido à sua capacidade de bloquear especificamente a atividade de FAS. Este trabalho teve como objetivo principal estudar o efeito da inibição da enzima FAS em células B 16 F 10 e em um modelo experimental de metástases espontâneas de melanoma em camundongos. O tratamento de camundongos portadores de melanomas intraperitoneais causados pela injeção de células B 16 F 10 com Orlistat reduziu em 50 % o número de metástases espontâneas para os linfonodos mediastínicos. Experimentos de citometria de fluxo mostraram que o tratamento da linhagem celular B 16 F 10 com Orlistat inibe a proliferação devido ao acúmulo de células em G 0 /G 1 e bloqueio da passagem para a fase S, que foi confirmado por um aumentona quantidade da proteína p 27 Kip 1 e concomitante redução de Skp 2. Através de ensaios de marcação com Anexina-V, observamos que Orlistat provoca um aumento na taxa de apoptose destas mesmas células. O presente modelo animal de metástases de melanoma mostrou-se útil para o estudo de drogas com potencial efeito anti-tumoral, como o Orlistat. A inibição da atividade de FAS tem um importante papel na disseminação metastática de melanomas de camundongos, possivelmente por inibir a proliferação e provocar apoptose nas células B 16 F 10. Abstract: Malignant melanoma is {{a cancer}} with poor prognosis {{due to its}} high metastatic potential and resistance to the existing chemotherapeutic agents. Fatty acid synthase is a metabolic enzyme with molecular mass of 250 kDa responsible for the endogenous biosynthesis of fatty acids. FAS converts acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA in the long chain fatty acid palmitate. FAS activity is downregulated in most normal human tissues except liver, adipose tissue, fetal lung and <b>lacting</b> breast. On the other hand, FAS is overexpressed in several malignant neoplasms, including malignant melanoma. For some tumors, FAS overexpression {{has been associated with}} a poor prognosis. Recently, the new inhibitor of FAS activity Orlistat was hown to inhibit the proliferation of prostate and breast cancer cell lines and the growth of their xenograft tumors. In this work we studied the effects of FAS inhibition in the B 16 F 10 melanoma cell line and in a animal model for melanoma metastasis. B 16 F 10 murine melanoma cells were intraperitoneally injected in 40 mice and an inhibition of 50 % in the number of mediastinal lymph node metastasis was observed in the Orlistat treated group. The inhibition of FAS was confirmed by ?Oil Red O? staining in frozen tissue sections. We also found that Orlistat promoted apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation of B 16 F 10 cells by blocking cell cycle progression, as demonstrated by flow cytometry experiments. Western blotting analysis of protein extracts obtained from Orlistat-treated cells revealed overexpression of p 27 Kip 1 and downregulation of Skp 2. In conclusion, the present animal model is useful for the study of drugs with antitumoral effect like Orlistat. The inhibition of FAS has an important role on the metastatic spread of melanoma in C 57 BL 6 mice by blocking the proliferation and inducing apoptosis in B 16 F 10 cells. In addition, the inhibition of FAS by Orlistat represents a new approach in order to develop drugs for melanoma chemotherap...|$|R
