5|$|The {{remaining}} three members, Staples, guitarist Neil Fraser, and multi-instrumentalist David Boulter, felt reinvigorated by the concert and were keen {{to continue as}} Tindersticks. In 2006 Staples {{and his family had}} relocated to Limousin in France, and {{during the first half of}} 2007 the band built their own studio, <b>Le</b> <b>Chien</b> Chanceaux, in a barn in his garden. Most of the recording for The Hungry Saw, the first new Tindersticks material in five years, took place over an eight-day period in June 2007 in the new studio. Dan McKinna and Thomas Belhom, who later became full-time members of the group, were recruited to play bass and drums respectively, and long-time collaborators Ian Caple, Terry Edwards, Lucy Wilkins and Calina de la Mare helped with the recording and the arrangements. Following further recording sessions at Eastcote Studios and Olympic Studios in London, the album was produced and mixed at <b>Le</b> <b>Chien</b> Chanceaux by Stuart Staples.|$|E
5|$|The Hungry Saw is {{the seventh}} studio album by British {{alternative}} band Tindersticks, released on 28 April 2008 by Beggars Banquet Records. Following {{the release of}} the band's sixth album, Waiting for the Moon in 2003, Tindersticks had entered an extended hiatus before reconvening to perform at the Don't Look Back event in September 2006. This concert marked the final performance of the original line-up of the band, and three members left the group shortly afterwards. The remaining members of Tindersticks felt reinvigorated by the performance, and relocated to France to begin working on new material in the summer of 2007, recording and producing the album at their own <b>Le</b> <b>Chien</b> Chanceaux studio in Limousin. The Hungry Saw was the first new Tindersticks material in five years.|$|E
25|$|The {{masculine}} subject <b>le</b> <b>chien</b> in (a) {{demands the}} masculine {{form of the}} predicative adjective blanc, whereas the feminine subject la maison demands the feminine form of this adjective. A morphological dependency that is entirely independent of the syntactic dependencies therefore points again across the syntactic hierarchy.|$|E

In early November 1977, the French recruits flew from Zurich to Johannesburg on a South African Airways liner, then to Salisbury by Air Rhodesia. Already in Rhodesia waiting for the men were their leaders: Major Roland de l'Assomption, an ex-officer of the French Army's crack 11th Shock Parachute Regiment, and a former officer of the Gabonese President Omar Bongo's guard; and Major Mario La Viola, once a non-commissioned officer in the Foreign Legion's 2nd Parachute Regiment. Beneath them were the Antillean Captain Toumi, who {{became the first black}} officer in the regular Rhodesian Army as the unit's second-in-command, and [...] "Colonel" [...] Bob Denard, an infamous French soldier of fortune nicknamed <b>le</b> <b>chien</b> de guerre—"the dog of war".|$|E
