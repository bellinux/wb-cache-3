5|$|Planning for a bypass around Northam {{began in}} the 1960s. The {{original}} route through the town centre functioned as both a <b>local</b> <b>access</b> <b>road</b> and primary traffic route, including for heavy vehicles. There were particular concerns {{with the amount of}} traffic congestion, frequency of crashes, and the noise and visual pollution of the highway's traffic. Twelve different alignments were considered for the bypass, which were narrowed down to three options by the 1990s. In 1993 the Environmental Protection Authority assessed the proposal, and found that only the route that deviated furthest away from the townsite would be environmentally acceptable. The closer routes were not acceptable due to the potential impact on the Avon River. The project gained the Minister for the Environment's conditional approval on 24 June 1994. Construction of the Northam bypass began in January 2001, with the new road opened on 17 May 2002.|$|E

In 1848 legislation was passed authorizing the construction of a spur route from the Bardstown Turnpike near Doup's Point to Taylorsville, by way of Jeffersontown. The route, initially called the Louisville and Taylorsville Pike, was completed by the late 19th century and was expanded to 4 lanes in the 1960s. In the early 1990s, as a part of improvements to I-264 and its interchanges, KY 155 was widened to 6 lanes south of the interchange and <b>local</b> <b>access</b> <b>roads</b> were built parallel to it, to provide easier access for residents whose driveways had previously opened onto the highway.|$|R

25|$|Brick, cobblestone, sett, wood plank, {{and wood}} block {{pavements}} such as Nicolson pavement, were once common {{in urban areas}} throughout the world, but fell out of fashion in most countries, due to {{the high cost of}} labor required to lay and maintain them, and are typically only kept for historical or aesthetic reasons. In some countries, however, they are still common in local streets. In the Netherlands, brick paving has made somewhat of a comeback since the adoption of a major nationwide traffic safety program in 1997. From 1998 through 2007, more than 41,000km of city streets were converted to <b>local</b> <b>access</b> <b>roads</b> with a speed limit of 30km/h, for the purpose of traffic calming.

40|$|The {{concept of}} traffic calming has {{successfully}} improved road safety. This concept applied {{in rural areas}} has provided new insights in the mitigation of negative effects of roads and traffic. Earlier {{studies have shown that}} the concept, distinguishing between <b>local</b> <b>access</b> <b>roads</b> and rural arterial highways, also can improve landscape connectivity for wildlife. Physical speed reducing devices are frequently used in the context of traffic calming, but applying these devices may negatively impact the coherence and identity of the landscape. Therefore an alternative approach for speed reduction has been proposed, namely applying local landscape elements, such as hedgerows, plantings, and objects of cultural heritage, such as railings of small bridges over local water courses, as speed reducing devices. We explain this “green approach” with examples from Dutch practice. We conclude that a combination of disciplines is needed to realize this new approach, that it may even be more cost effective than traditional approaches and additionally improves landscape quality. The new insights are at least equally effective from a landscape ecological viewpoin...|$|R

Although not officially a part of the Sustainable Safety road categorisation policy, the woonerf is still a legally defined Dutch road type. The defining characteristic is that the living function of the street (walking, talking, playing) has official priority over its traffic function. Legally, pedestrians and children have priority over all other road users. They may use the full width of the street to walk and play. Road paving is more or less continuous. Under article 45 of the Dutch traffic code, motorised traffic in a woonerf is restricted to [...] "walking pace", which the Dutch Supreme Court has ruled to be 15 km/h. Parking is also restricted.Although woonerven have come under pressure from the drive to implement zones of 30 km/h <b>local</b> <b>access</b> streets, they are still prolific. In some places, new ones are still created, such as for space restrictions. In 2011, 20% of all Dutch homes were still located in woonerf areas, and around 2 million people were living in woonerven.|$|R

40|$|Objectives—To {{assess the}} eVectiveness of community/environmental {{interventions}} undertaken {{as part of}} the Child Pedes-trian Injury Prevention Project (CPIPP). Setting—Three communities (local gov-ernment areas) in the Perth metropolitan area, Western Australia. Methods—A quasiexperimental commu-nity intervention trial was undertaken over three years (1995 – 97). Three commu-nities were assigned to either: a community/environmental road safety in-tervention and a school based road/ pedestrian safety education program (intervention group 1); a school based road/pedestrian safety education program only (intervention group 2); or to no road safety intervention (comparison group). Quantification of the various road safety community/environmental activities un-dertaken in each community during the trial was measured, and a cumulative community activity index developed. Esti-mates of the volume and speed of vehicu-lar traYc were monitored over a two year period. Results—Greater road safety activity was observed in intervention group 1 com-pared with the other groups. A significant reduction in the volume of traYc on <b>local</b> <b>access</b> <b>roads</b> was also observed over the period of the trial in intervention group 1, but not in the remaining groups. Conclusions—The findings indicate that the various community/environmental in-terventions initiated in collaboration with CPIPP in intervention group 1 contrib-uted, in part, to the observed reduction in the volume of traYc. A combination of community/environmental interventions and education are likely to reduce the rate of childhood pedestrian injury...|$|R
