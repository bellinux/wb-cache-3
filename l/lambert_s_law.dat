40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{theoretical}} and empirical studies on Emmert 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>law</b> describing relationships between sizes and distances of an afterimage. The paper is divided into six main parts. The first part introduces {{the origin of the}} problem of Emmert 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>law.</b> The second part describes three interpretations of Emmert 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>law</b> discussed previously: (1) the law as geometrical optics, (2) the law stating relationships of perceived size and physical distance, and (3) the law stating relationships of perceived size and perceived distance. The present paper adopts the third interpretation. The third part describes that Emmert 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>law</b> is equivalent to the size-distance invariance hypothesis when the third interpretation is valid. The forth part reviews various empirical studies of Emmert 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>law.</b> The fifth part describes experiments to estimate the perceived distance by using Emmert 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>law.</b> Finally, the sixth part reviews the results of studies examining the range of viewing distance to which Emmert 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>law</b> can be applied...|$|R

It begins by considering {{the ways in which the}} domestic legal services market has internationalized by focusing on changes in legal education and examines the disconnection between U.

The article proceeds to consider the ways in which U. <b>S.</b> <b>law</b> firms have become global organizations by offshoring their international identities, through the staffing of their non-U.

Based on a database of more than 5, 000 lawyers working in the offshore offices of 60 U. <b>S.</b> -based <b>law</b> firms, this article reveals this globalization strategy. Internationalization has been accomplished at local levels by most U. <b>S.</b> <b>law</b> firms. One consequence of this method of internationalization through offshoring is that the need for dual trained lawyers is minimal. While U. <b>S.</b> <b>law</b> schools attract increasing numbers of foreign lawyer students, U. <b>S.</b> <b>law</b> firms remain disinterested in hiring and training them. U. <b>S.</b> <b>law</b> firms have succeeded in going global by going local.

40|$|Whether {{working for}} global or local organizations, lawyers today are {{increasingly}} {{faced with the}} prospect of working with colleagues and competitors who are diverse in terms of nationality, education and training, and with clients whose problems may be as locally-focused as a Chicago zoning matter or as distant as the acquisition of one non-U. S. company by another. The global forces shaping business and the practice of law are felt in legal education, too, and U. <b>S.</b> <b>law</b> schools occupy a leading role in educating domestic and non-U. S. students for practice in the transnational marketplace. In spite of this, however, the core educational experience at nearly all U. <b>S.</b> <b>law</b> schools remains distinctly domestic in terms of substantive focus. The first year curriculum generally emphasizes exclusively U. <b>S.</b> <b>law,</b> and even most 2 ̆ 2 core 2 ̆ 2 upper level courses are jurisdictionally limited to U. <b>S.</b> <b>law.</b> While this U.

In addition, what we might term 2 ̆ 2 global sensitivity 2 ̆ 2 is crucial, as is the need to understand business and apply its lessons to legal practice.

40|$|This paper {{carries out}} a {{critical}} reappraisal {{of the two}} contending theories purporting to explain long-run government spending: Wagner 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>Law</b> and different variants of the ratchet effect. We analyze data spanning from the early 19 th century until the present day in Sweden and the United Kingdom. Hence, in contrast to previous studies, we evaluate the validity of Wagner 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>Law</b> and the ratchet effect hypothesis over {{a very long time}} period, starting at the beginning of industrialization. Cointegration analysis is used to investigate the long-run relationships between government expenditure and GDP, focusing on sub-periods and structural breaks. Moreover, we test the ratchet effect hypothesis by estimating models which allow for asymmetric adjustment. According to our main results, Wagner 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>Law</b> does not hold in the long run, although the data are consistent with Wagner 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>Law</b> between roughly 1860 and the mid 1970 s.

Yet Wagner 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>Law</b> did not hold during the initial industrialization phase (before 1860), and in recent periods GDP only affects the government spending share when we control for population age structure.
