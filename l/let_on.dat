5|$|The {{design was}} adopted by an Act of Parliament in 1813, which {{permitted}} the commissioners to borrow £600,000 for building and construction. The street was intended to have commercial purposes and {{it was expected that}} a majority of the income would come from private capital. Nash took responsibility for design and valuation of all properties. Construction of the road resulted in demolishing numerous properties, disrupting trade and polluting the air with dust. Existing tenants had first offer to purchase leases on the new properties. The Treasury supported the proposal because, in the aftermath of the lengthy Napoleonic Wars, there was an urgent need for the government to create jobs. Government expenditure was low because the design relied heavily upon private developers, such as Nash himself. The buildings were to be <b>let</b> <b>on</b> 99-year leases, as was common at the time, and income could be recouped in the form of ground rent.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Knútr took other actions to contain Orkney. Evidence that Knútr installed Hákon as overlord of the Isles may be preserved by the twelfth-century Ágrip af Nóregskonungasǫgum. The historicity of this event is uncertain, however, and Hákon's authority in the Isles is not attested by any other source. Be that as it may, this twelfth-century text states that Hákon had been sent into the Isles by Óláfr, and that Hákon ruled the region {{for the rest of}} his life. The chronology outlined by this source suggests that Hákon left Norway at about the time Óláfr assumed the kingship in 1016. The former is certainly known to have been in Knútr's service soon afterwards in England. One possibility is that Knútr installed Hákon as overlord of Orkney and the Isles in about 1016/1017, before handing him possession of the Earldom of Worcester in about 1017. If this was the case, Hákon would have been responsible for not only a strategic part of the Anglo-Welsh frontier, but also accountable for the far-reaching sea-lanes that stretched from the Irish Sea region to Norway. It seems likely that Knútr was more concerned about Orkney and the Isles, and the security of the sea-lanes around Scotland, than surviving sources <b>let</b> <b>on.</b> Hákon's death at sea would have certainly been a cause of concern for Knútr's regime, and could have been directly responsible to the meeting between him and the three kings. If Hákon had indeed possessed overlordship of the Isles, his demise could well have paved the way for Echmarcach's own rise to power. Having come to terms with the three kings, it {{is possible}} that Knútr relied upon Echmarcach to counter the ambitions of the Orcadians, who could have attempted to seize upon Hákon's fall and renew their influence in the Isles.|$|E

The hijackers responded that they would accept that half the passengers be released when three prisoners were on board. After consultations this was accepted by the police.|$|E

25|$|Under {{the process}} of British Rail's privatisation, {{operations}} were split into more than 100 companies. The ownership and operation of the infrastructure of the railway system {{was taken over by}} Railtrack. The Telecomms infrastructure and British Rail Telecommunications was sold to Racal, which in turn was sold to Global Crossing and merged with Thales Group. The rolling stock was transferred to three private ROSCOs (rolling stock companies). Passenger services were divided into 25 operating companies, which were <b>let</b> <b>on</b> a franchise basis for a set period, whilst goods services were sold off completely. Dozens of smaller engineering and maintenance companies were also created and sold off.|$|E
25|$|Construction of this {{branch line}} had {{followed}} a fair bit of argument {{as to who}} should finance it - the C or the Matlock (later Midland) Railway. The C ultimately agreed, on 19 January 1852, to build it at its own expense, but asked the Matlock Company for a siding at the junction, which was provided. Following an advertisement in the Derby Mercury on 6 October of that year, asking for tenders to construct this line, 58 chains long (see illustration), the contract was <b>let</b> <b>on</b> 16 October, and opened the following year, running along a shelf above and largely parallel to the river Derwent.|$|E

It was only when Nimoy began to agree with Justman's suggestion that the producer <b>let</b> <b>on</b> that it was a joke, which Nimoy found amusing. Nimoy became unhappy with his pay during the course of the season, since Shatner was being paid more than he was. But he was asked by the producers to table the discussion until confirmation was received that the series was renewed.|$|E

25|$|The {{first major}} {{decision}} for the authorities was whether the prisoners should be released. Palme gave the orders for preliminary release at 21:00. The cabinet met at 22:00 and by 23:00 it had concluded that the prisoners were to be transported to Bulltofta as an intermediate measure. There were at the time rumors that the terrorists were Serbs who had the intention of murdering the Croatians once they were on board the aircraft. The cabinet therefore decided that the prisoners would only be <b>let</b> <b>on</b> board if they agreed to themselves, after consulting with the hijackers. However, the issue was complicated around midnight when the Bulltofta base of operations received a threat by telefax which threatened to kill Palme, Geijer and two other ministers if the prisoners were handed over.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not clear}} when the station was opened. This may {{have been at the}} same time as the line did on 31 May 1898 or during the 1900s. The {{distance}} to the neighboring stations was limited. However, two influential people in the operating company Holmenkolbanen lived in the vicinity. The one was engineer Halvor Emil Heyerdahl, who lived at Heyerdhals vei 1 (named after himself). Presumably the station was at first not official, but trams would stop there to <b>let</b> <b>on</b> and off the executives. During the 1900s it received a platform. By then Johannes Harbitz, who also lived adjacent to the station, had become the company's director. Due to limited patronage the station was closed in 1935. It remains the only station to have been closed on the line.|$|E
25|$|The {{engineers}} were: Joseph Locke, George W. Buck and William Baker. Contracts were <b>let</b> <b>on</b> 23 Oct 1845 to David Bellhouse (South Junction) and John Brogden (Altrincham Branch). After some haggling {{over the}} price of land etc., a report of actual construction was presented on 30 Oct 1846. However work was then suspended as the company {{had run out of}} money. A public offering of five year bonds at 5% per annum raised only £50,000 so a further Act of Parliament (22 Jul 1848) was required to increase the capital by £250,000 to £650,000. The two owning companies each provided half of this amount. On 20 Jan 1849 a viaduct near Oxford Road collapsed as the scaffolding was removed. Three men died and two were injured. On the 25th the two adjacent arches failed without injury. The accepted reason was slow setting of mortar in wet weather.|$|E

25|$|The {{origins of}} NY243 {{date back to}} the early 1910s when the state of New York {{improved}} the portion between the hamlet of Rushford and Rushford Lake to state highway standards. A contract for the project was awarded on April5, 1910, and the rebuilt road was added to the state highway system on February13, 1913, as unsigned State Highway801 (SH801). The section between Rushford Lake and the hamlet of Caneadea was reconstructed under a contract <b>let</b> <b>on</b> June12, 1922. Work on the road was completed by 1926, and the highway became state-maintained as SH1606. The remainder of the modern route northwest of Rushford was added in the mid-1920s. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, hundreds of state-owned roads were given posted route numbers for the first time. NY243 was assigned at this time, extending from Farmersville to Caneadea over SH801, SH1606, and the Farmersville–Rushford state highway.|$|E
25|$|The {{prisoners were}} {{informed}} {{of the situation and}} the demands. At this time it was still not evident whether the two groups were friends or foes. As the only prisoner, Barešić stated at 02:12 that he was interested in letting the transaction take place without talking to the hijackers. Others talked to the hijackers, but they did not agree to the transfer. Barešić thereafter convinced all but one of them to accept the deal. Planning the practical aspects of the transaction was forcing the issue past the deadline. This was finalised at 03:02 when it was decided that the dissident would not be exchanged. Under command of Superintendent Lewijn, 30 passengers would be released after which two prisoners would be sent by police escort to the aircraft and <b>let</b> <b>on</b> board. This would be done three times until all passengers were safe and all willing prisoners aboard, with the cabin crew being let off in the last wave.|$|E
25|$|The {{section of}} NY121 in Westchester County was first {{improved}} to state highway standards {{as part of}} three separate projects contracted out {{by the state of}} New York in 1903. South of NY35, the road was rebuilt under a contract awarded on July19 and added to the state highway system on June12, 1905, as part of State Highway144 (SH144). The remainder of the route in the county was reconstructed as part of contracts <b>let</b> <b>on</b> June14 and June19, with the former covering the segment between the west end of the NY35 overlap and NY138. The roads improved by both projects were accepted into the state highway system on December21 and26, 1907, as SH150 and SH151, respectively. All three state highway numbers are unsigned. In Putnam County, modern NY121 was locally maintained until {{the latter half of the}} 1920s. NY121 was designated in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to its current alignment.|$|E

25|$|Nathan-Turner {{had thought}} that he too would finally be leaving the series, but with no other {{producer}} available or {{willing to take on}} the series, he was instructed to remain. As a BBC staff producer, he {{had little choice but to}} either accept this or resign from the Corporation's staff. Not having expected to be producing season twenty-four, Nathan-Turner was left with little time to prepare, hiring inexperienced Andrew Cartmel as script editor on the advice of a friend who had run a BBC Drama Script Unit course that Cartmel had attended, and casting little-known Scottish actor Sylvester McCoy as the Seventh Doctor. In his first season, McCoy, a comedy actor, portrayed the character with a degree of clown-like humour, but Cartmel's influence soon changed that. The Seventh Doctor developed into a darker figure than any of his earlier incarnations, manipulating people like chess pieces and always seeming to be playing a deeper game than he ever <b>let</b> <b>on.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most {{of what is}} now NY334 was {{originally}} improved to state highway standards in the early 20th century as part of three separate projects. The first section of the road to be brought up to standards was the piece between the Fonda village line and the hamlet of Berryville, legislatively designated as State Highway302 (SH302). Construction on the road took roughly 18months, and the highway was added to the state highway system on January21, 1908. The portion of modern NY334 in Fulton County was designated SH619 and accepted into the state highway system on January7, 1918, following two years of work to rebuild the road. The segment between the two improved highways was assigned SH515 and improved under a contract <b>let</b> <b>on</b> November2, 1916. It was 16% complete as of the end of 1918 and finished by 1926. The three unsigned state highways were designated as NY334 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} NY95 {{date back to}} the early 1910s when the highway was {{improved}} to state highway standards by the state of New York as part of two separate projects. North of Bombay, the road was rebuilt as part of a contract <b>let</b> <b>on</b> February18, 1910, that also covered part of what is now NY37. It was added to the state highway system on November28, 1910, as State Highway820 (SH820). The section between Moira and Bombay was reconstructed under a contract awarded on March22, 1911, and accepted as a state highway on September16, 1913, as SH885. Both numbers are unsigned. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY95 was assigned to an alignment extending from Saint Regis Falls in the south to the vicinity of Hogansburg in the north. North of Moira, the route was overlaid on SH885 and SH820. NY95 was truncated to US11 in Moira , and its former alignment south to Saint Regis Falls is now maintained by Franklin County as CR5.|$|E
