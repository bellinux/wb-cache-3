40|$|Copyright © 2007 Reconstruction'Positive' {{representations}} of <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay parents within the media continue to draw {{parallels between the}} experiences of heterosexual parents <b>and</b> those of <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay parents. Such comparisons are typically aimed at 'proving' that <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay parents are acceptable parents. There is, however, most often a failure to examine how race mediates {{representations of}} the category 'parent', the result being that references to 'parents' typically refer to white parents. The category parent is thus built upon a series of exclusions, ones with which white <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay parents may unwittingly be complicit. Through an examination of both a radio interview with the Australian Prime Minister John Howard and newspaper reports focusing on <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay parents, I explore how white heterosexual parenting becomes the norm from which white <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay parents are at times excluded, but to which {{those of us who}} identify as such parents may at times aspire. Examining the race privilege of white <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay parents, and developing an ethical framework through which to claim rights, may be one way of engaging with the problematic representation of <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay parents more broadly.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a qualitative research study exploring <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay affirmative psychotherapy. The participants comprised two sets of people. The first are <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay male clients, the second are <b>lesbian,</b> gay male <b>and</b> heterosexual female therapists. These therapists are accredited Clinical and Counselling Psychologists, Registered Psychotherapists and Accredited Counsellors <b>and</b> identify as <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay affirmative -practitioners. The study explored accounts of <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay affirmative psychotherapy to see in which ways it is qualitatively different from other forms of therapy with a view to theorising the process of <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay affirmative psychotherapy. In-depth interviews were conducted and a grounded theory methodology was undertaken. This is discussed in terms of method and epistemology. The findings are represented in diagrammatic and text forms and I outline process models of <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> -gay affirmative therapy. While some of the findings have suggested that <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay affirmative therapeutic practice might be characterised by particular stances or practices, many of the findings can be incorporated'into a range of psychotherapeutic perspectives.

5|$|Lack of {{differentiation}} between homosexual and heterosexual women in medical studies that concentrate on health issues for women skews results for <b>lesbians</b> <b>and</b> non-lesbian women. Reports are inconclusive about occurrence {{of breast cancer}} in lesbians. It has been determined, however, that the lower rate of lesbians tested by regular Pap smears {{makes it more difficult}} to detect cervical cancer at early stages in lesbians. The risk factors for developing ovarian cancer rates are higher in lesbians than heterosexual women, perhaps because many lesbians lack protective factors of pregnancy, abortion, contraceptives, breast feeding, and miscarriages.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with sociological conceptualisations of <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay sexualities as reflexive forms of existence, and identifies core problems with these. Our sociological narratives about <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay reflexivity tend to be partial in two senses. First, they talk about and envision only very particular - and relatively exclusive – experience, and fail to adequately account for the significance of difference and power in shaping diverse <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay experiences. Second, {{they tend to be}} underpinned by overly affirmative and normative projects, and are often narratives about how <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay life should be. Our narratives about <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay reflexivity sometimes confuse analysis with prescription, and actualities with potentialities. Their partiality limits the analytical purchase they afford, and is an inadequate basis on which to analyse contemporary <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay identities and ways of living. The article proposes an approach to studying <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay living that is orientated more towards reflexive sociology than the sociology of reflexive sexualities.

40|$|Book synopsis: With this {{benchmark}} work, <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay studies {{comes of}} age. Drawing from a rich team of global contributors and carefully structured to elucidate the core {{issues in the}} field, it constitutes an unparalleled resource for teaching, research and debate. The volume is organized into 4 sections: - History and Theory. This covers the roots of <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay studies, the institutionalization of the subject in the Academy, the 'naturalness' of heterosexuality, science and sexuality, the comparative sociology of homosexualities and the heterosexual/homosexual division. - Identity and Community. This examines the formation of gay <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> identities communities <b>and</b> movements, 'cyber-queer' research, sexuality and space, generational issues in <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay lifecycles {{and the subject of}} bisexuality - Institutions. This investigates questions of the governance of sexualities, <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay health, sexualities and education, religion and homosexuality, homosexuality and the law, gay <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> workers, homosexuality <b>and</b> the family, <b>and</b> <b>lesbian,</b> gay <b>and</b> queer encounters with the media and popular culture - Politics. This explores the formation of the gay <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> movements, impact of globalization, antigay <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> violence, nationalism <b>and</b> transnationalism in <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay studies and sexual citizenship. The result is an authoritative book that demarcates the field, stimulates critical discussion <b>and</b> provides <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay studies with an enriching focal reference point. It is, quite simply, a breakthrough work that will galvanize discussion and research for years to come...|$|R

5|$|Women who {{identify}} as lesbian report feeling significantly different and isolated during adolescence. These emotions {{have been cited}} as appearing on average at 15 years old in <b>lesbians</b> <b>and</b> 18 years old in women {{who identify}} as bisexual. On the whole, women tend to work through developing a self-concept internally, or with other women with whom they are intimate. Women also limit who they divulge their sexual identities to, and more often see being lesbian as a choice, as opposed to gay men, who work more externally and see being gay as outside their control.|$|E
5|$|In India, a 14th-century Indian text {{mentioning}} {{a lesbian}} couple {{who had a}} child {{as a result of}} their lovemaking is an exception to the general silence about female homosexuality. This invisibility disappeared with the release of a film titled Fire in 1996, prompting some theaters in India to be attacked by extremists. Terms used to label homosexuals are often rejected by Indian activists for being the result of imperialist influence, but most discourse on homosexuality centers on men. Women's rights groups in India continue to debate the legitimacy of including lesbian issues in their platforms, as <b>lesbians</b> <b>and</b> material focusing on female homosexuality are frequently suppressed.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To examine <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay people’s {{expectations}} of support, socialising and cohabitation in older age. Methods: The study involved secondary data {{analysis of a}} subsample of 371 <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay people taken from a {{survey conducted by the}} Queensland Association for Healthy Communities. Results: <b>Lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay people expected to receive support from diverse sources, including same-sex partners, <b>lesbian,</b> gay, bisexual <b>and</b> transgender friends and heterosexual friends. Women were more likely to expect to receive support from others than men, and men were more likely to expect to live alone in later life. Conclusions: Aged care providers need to be responsive to the different sources of support that may be provided to older <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay people. Services that are lesbian- and gay-friendly may facilitate service uptake and reduce pressures on <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay people’s informal networks of support...|$|R

5|$|Before the {{rebellion}} at the Stonewall Inn, homosexuals were, as historians Dudley Clendinen and Adam Nagourney write, a secret legion of people, known of but discounted, ignored, laughed at or despised. And like the holders of a secret, {{they had an}} advantage which was a disadvantage, too, and which was true of no other minority group in the United States. They were invisible. Unlike African Americans, women, Native Americans, Jews, the Irish, Italians, Asians, Hispanics, or any other cultural group which struggled for respect and equal rights, homosexuals had no physical or cultural markings, no language or dialect which could identify them to each other, or to anyone else... But that night, for the first time, the usual acquiescence turned into violent resistance.... From that night {{the lives of millions}} of gay men and <b>lesbians,</b> <b>and</b> the attitude toward them of the larger culture in which they lived, began to change rapidly.

40|$|<b>Lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay {{parenthood}} is {{the most}} adversed topics of the recognition of <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay families, both {{from the point of}} view of the concession of rights and the one of social legitimation. In Italy, the sociological research on the recognition of <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay families with children is not comparable to the international one. Nevertheless, the development of a political discourse on the rights of <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay people – with or without families, with or without children – by European institutions is broadening the interest of Italian sociologists. The article analyses the experiences of 12 gay Italian <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay parents in order to understand how they negotiate and achieve social legitimation in front of their families of origin, local institutions and neighbours. Results show that <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay families with children give an important contribution for the pluralization of practices and meanings related to the family. At the same time, they reproduce some crucial features supporting the hegemonic interpretation of the family: the centrality of the couple and the importance of blood ties for the definition of kinship...|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{examined}} the attitudes of heterosexuals towards <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay parenting, revealing mostly negative attitudes. Nonetheless, no research {{studies have examined}} these attitudes specifically among elderly adults. Two hundred eighty older heterosexuals adults ranged from 65 to 87 years old (women: M = 74. 2, SD = 6. 0; male M = 73. 9, SD = 6. 1) completed measures evaluating their knowledge of the existence of <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay parents, their attitudes towards <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay parenting and expected child outcomes, and opinions regarding legalization <b>and</b> recognition of <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay parents. As we expected, age was a relevant predictor of negative attitudes towards <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay parenting: older elders had a stronger prejudice than the others. Data revealed that the more positive evaluation was for the heterosexual <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> parents while the more negative evaluation was for the gay male parents. Regression analyses showed that a negative attitude towards <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> gay parents was predicted by older age, right-wing conservatism, and internalized sexual stigma. The expected effects on child outcomes were predicted only by the dimensions of sexual stigma. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|R
