5|$|The {{use of a}} {{subwoofer}} augments {{the bass}} capability of the main speakers, and allows them to be smaller without sacrificing <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> capability. A subwoofer does not necessarily provide superior bass performance in comparison to large conventional loudspeakers on ordinary music recordings due to the typical lack of very <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> content on such sources. However, there are recordings with substantial <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> content that most conventional loudspeakers are ill-equipped to handle {{without the help of}} a subwoofer, especially at high playback levels, such as music for pipe organs with 32' (9.75 meter) bass pipes (16Hz), very large bass drums on symphony orchestra recordings and electronic music with extremely low synth bass parts, such as bass tests or bass songs.|$|E
5|$|Glow {{discharge}} plasmas: non-thermal plasmas {{generated by}} the application of DC or <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> RF (<100 kHz) electric field to the gap between two metal electrodes. Probably the most common plasma; {{this is the type}} of plasma generated within fluorescent light tubes.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 Michalos {{reported}} {{the results of}} an analysis of the occurrences of people with the surname Counsell registered as independent barristers in England and Wales versus those with the name in England and Wales as whole. Given the <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> of the name in England and Wales as a whole he expected to find no one registered, but three barristers named Counsell were found.|$|E
50|$|Using {{relatively}} <b>low</b> <b>frequencies</b> also conveys additional advantages. First, <b>low</b> <b>frequencies</b> {{are generally}} more penetrating than higher frequencies. For instance, at 2.4 GHz a reinforced concrete wall might attenuate signals as much as 20 dB. Second, the long wavelengths associated with <b>low</b> <b>frequencies</b> are far less vulnerable to multipath. In dense metallic structures, multipath obscures or destroys the ability of microwave or UHF signals {{to be used for}} reliable positioning. <b>Low</b> <b>frequencies</b> are less affected by this problem.|$|R
50|$|In this example, AOL = 100 dB at <b>low</b> <b>frequencies,</b> and 1 / β = 58 dB. At <b>low</b> <b>frequencies,</b> AFB ≈ 58 dB as well.|$|R
30|$|Many {{practical}} noise situations, however, have to {{be modeled}} as diffuse noise [22], with high correlation in the <b>low</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Therefore, the noise PSD is underestimated especially at <b>low</b> <b>frequencies.</b>|$|R
5|$|Tom Horral, a Boston-based acoustician, blames {{complaints}} about modern movies being too loud on subwoofers. He says that before subwoofers {{made it possible}} to have loud, relatively undistorted bass, movie sound levels were limited by the distortion in less capable systems at <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> and high levels.|$|E
5|$|As the {{efficiency}} {{is proportional to}} Fs3, small improvements in <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> extension with the same driver and box volume will result in very significant reductions in efficiency. For these reasons, subwoofers are typically very inefficient at converting electrical energy into sound energy. This combination of factors accounts for the higher amplifier power required to drive subwoofers, and the requirement for greater power handling for subwoofer drivers. Enclosure variations (e.g., bass reflex designs with a port in the cabinet) are often used for subwoofers to increase {{the efficiency}} of the driver/enclosure system, helping to reduce the amplifier power requirements.|$|E
5|$|For {{greatest}} {{efficiency and}} best coupling to the room's air volume, subwoofers {{can be placed}} {{in a corner of the}} room, far from large room openings, and closer to the listener. This is possible since low bass frequencies have a long wavelength; hence there is little difference between the information reaching a listener's left and right ears, and so they cannot be readily localized. All <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> information is sent to the subwoofer. However, unless the sound tracks have been carefully mixed for a single subwoofer channel, it's possible to have some cancellation of low frequencies if bass information in one channel is out of phase with another.|$|E
40|$|We {{considered}} {{the importance of}} <b>low</b> <b>frequencies</b> in seis-mic reflection data for enhanced resolution, better penetra-tion, and waveform and impedance inversion. We reviewed various theoretical arguments underlining why adding <b>low</b> <b>frequencies</b> may be beneficial and provided experimental evidence for the improvements by several case studies with recently acquired broadband data. We discussed where re-search and development efforts in the industry with respect to <b>low</b> <b>frequencies</b> should be focusing...|$|R
50|$|Very <b>low</b> <b>frequencies</b> (VLF: 3-30 kHz), and {{extremely}} <b>low</b> <b>frequencies</b> (ELF: <3 kHz) are reflected at the ionospheric D- and lower E-layer. An exception is whistler propagation of lightning signals along the geomagnetic field lines.|$|R
30|$|The {{regression}} coefficients estimated at <b>low</b> <b>frequencies</b> (< ∼ 1 day− 1) {{may not be}} reliable because the estimated lags have large errors. Here, the {{regression coefficients}} are re-estimated assuming that the lag is zero (Fig. 5). At <b>low</b> <b>frequencies,</b> the re-estimated regression coefficients are equivalent to those estimated based on the maximum lagged correlation. So, the actual lags at <b>low</b> <b>frequencies</b> {{are expected to have}} maxima of tens to hundreds of minutes for the respective OBTMs. Compared with the periods of several days, the several-hour lags are relatively small in phase dimension. Thus, the regression coefficients are relatively constant at their maxima at <b>low</b> <b>frequencies.</b>|$|R
5|$|For {{owners of}} 33rpm LPs and 45singles, loud and deep bass was {{limited by the}} ability of the {{phonograph}} record stylus to track the groove. Some hi-fi aficionados solved the problem by using reel-to-reel tape players which were capable of delivering accurate, naturally deep bass from acoustic sources, or synthetic bass not found in nature. With the popular introduction of the compact cassette and the CD, it became possible to add more <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> content to recordings, and satisfy a larger number of consumers. Home subwoofers grew in popularity, as they were easy to add to existing multimedia speaker setups and they were easy to position or hide.|$|E
5|$|Gradually, the <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> active RC filter was {{supplanted by}} the switched-capacitor filter that {{operated}} in the discrete time domain {{rather than the}} continuous time domain. All of these filter technologies require precision components for high performance filtering, and that often requires that the filters be tuned. Adjustable components are expensive, and the labor to do the tuning can be significant. Tuning the poles and zeros of a 7th-order elliptic filter {{is not a simple}} exercise. Integrated circuits have made digital computation inexpensive, so now <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> filtering is done with digital signal processors. Such digital filters have no problem implementing ultra-precise (and stable) values, so no tuning or adjustment is required. Digital filters also don't have to worry about stray coupling paths and shielding the individual filter sections from one another. One downside is the digital signal processing may consume much more power than an equivalent LC filter. Inexpensive digital technology has largely supplanted analogue implementations of filters. However, there is still an occasional place for them in the simpler applications such as coupling where sophisticated functions of frequency are not needed.|$|E
5|$|Stacking or rigging the subwoofers in a {{vertical}} array focuses the low frequencies {{forward to a}} greater or lesser extent depending on the physical length of the array. Longer arrays have a more directional effect at lower frequencies. The directionality is more pronounced in the vertical dimension, yielding a radiation pattern that is wide but not tall. This helps reduce the amount of <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> sound bouncing off the ceiling indoors and assists in mitigating external noise complaints outdoors.|$|E

A few {{isolated}} occurrences of E-V38 have also been observed among populations in Southern Europe, such as Croatia, Malta, Spain and Portugal.|$|R
40|$|A {{normalized}} 2 D multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA) with a computational {{complexity of}} O(N) for <b>low</b> <b>frequencies</b> is developed. This normalized 2 D MLFMA {{can be used}} independently not only at <b>low</b> <b>frequencies,</b> but be merged easily with the dynamic algorithm to solve large-scale problems with dense subgridded areas. Some numerical computations are performed, and good agreement is observed with the plain conjugate gradient (CG) method. The null space problem for boundary integral equations at <b>low</b> <b>frequencies</b> is also studied. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|Typically, {{the width}} of the {{stopband}} is 1 to 2 decades (that is, the highest frequency attenuated is 10 to 100 times the <b>lowest</b> <b>frequency</b> attenuated). However, in the audio band, a notch filter has high and <b>low</b> <b>frequencies</b> that may be only semitones apart.|$|R
5|$|Subwoofers {{are made}} up of one or more woofers mounted in a {{loudspeaker}} enclosure—often made of wood—capable of withstanding air pressure while resisting deformation. Subwoofer enclosures {{come in a variety of}} designs, including bass reflex (with a port or vent), using a subwoofer and one or more passive radiator speakers in the enclosure, acoustic suspension (sealed enclosure), infinite baffle, horn-loaded, and bandpass designs, representing unique trade-offs with respect to efficiency, <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> range, cabinet size and cost. Passive subwoofers have a subwoofer driver and enclosure and they are powered by an external amplifier. Active subwoofers include a built-in amplifier.|$|E
5|$|Telecommunication and {{broadcast}} networks {{can be affected}} by volcanic ash in the following ways: attenuation and reduction of signal strength; damage to equipment; and overloading of network through user demand. Signal attenuation due to volcanic ash is not well documented; however, {{there have been reports}} of disrupted communications following the 1969 Surtsey eruption and 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption. Research by the New Zealand-based Auckland Engineering Lifelines Group determined theoretically that impacts on telecommunications signals from ash would be limited to <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> services such as satellite communication. Signal interference may also be caused by lightning, as this is frequently generated within volcanic eruption plumes.|$|E
5|$|The end-fire array trades a few {{decibels}} {{of output}} power for directionality, so it requires more enclosures {{for the same}} output power as a tight-packed, flat-fronted array of enclosures. Sixteen enclosures in four rows were used in 2007 {{at one of the}} stages of the Ultra Music Festival, to reduce <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> interference to neighboring stages. Because of the physical size of the end-fire array, few concert venues are able to implement it. The output pattern suffers from comb-filtering off-axis, but can be further shaped by adjusting the frequency response of each row of subwoofers.|$|E
50|$|For DC {{measurements}} 1/f noise can {{be particularly}} troublesome, as it is very significant at <b>low</b> <b>frequencies,</b> tending to infinity with integration/averaging at DC. At very <b>low</b> <b>frequencies,</b> {{you can think of}} the noise as becoming drift, although the mechanisms causing drift are usually distinct from flicker noise.|$|R

40|$|Chinchillas {{were trained}} to {{discriminate}} a cosine-phase harmonic tone complex (COS) from wideband noise (WBN) and tested in a stimulus generalization paradigm with tone complexes in which phase differed between frequency regions. In this split-phase condition, responses to complexes made of random-phase <b>low</b> <b>frequencies,</b> cosine-phase high frequencies were similar to responses to the COS-training stimulus. However, responses to complexes made of cosine-phase <b>low</b> <b>frequencies,</b> random-phase high frequencies were generally lower than their responses to the COS-training stimulus. When tested with sine-phase (SIN) and random-phase (RND) tone complexes, responses were large for SIN, but were small for RND. Chinchillas were then trained to discriminate infinitely-iterated rippled noise (IIRN) from WBN and tested with noises in which the spectral ripple differed between frequency regions. In this split-spectrum condition, responses were large to noises made of rippled-spectrum <b>low</b> <b>frequencies,</b> flat-spectrum high frequencies, whereas responses were generally lower to noises made of flat-spectrum <b>low</b> <b>frequencies,</b> rippled-spectrum high frequencies. The results suggest that chinchillas listen across all frequencies, but attend to high frequencies when discriminating COS from WBN and attend to <b>low</b> <b>frequencies</b> when discriminating IIRN from WBN...|$|R
5|$|In {{starting}} a motor, a VFD initially applies a <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> and voltage, thus avoiding high inrush current associated with direct-on-line starting. After {{the start of}} the VFD, the applied frequency and voltage are increased at a controlled rate or ramped up to accelerate the load. This starting method typically allows a motor to develop 150% of its rated torque while the VFD is drawing less than 50% of its rated current from the mains in the low-speed range. A VFD can be adjusted to produce a steady 150% starting torque from standstill right up to full speed. However, motor cooling deteriorates and can result in overheating as speed decreases such that prolonged low-speed operation with significant torque is not usually possible without separately motorized fan ventilation.|$|E

This is further supported by Schnadt and Corley where they found that prolongations and fillers increased in words just before multiple-named or <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> items.|$|E
