500|$|The {{majority}} of the album was recorded at Miraval Studios, France, picked, at keyboardist Cian Ciaran's request, because of its large <b>live</b> <b>room</b> which enabled all the band {{to set up and}} play as a group. The Super Furries wanted to [...] "go somewhere new and have a cultural experience" [...] while they recorded what is their eighth album together. Recording in France also enabled the band to get away from distractions such as [...] "clean the house". Additional recording took place at Rockfield Studios, Monmouth while string instruments were recorded at Metropolis Studios, London.|$|E
500|$|Caribbean Sound Basin's main studio {{had both}} analog and digital equipment, a 60ft x 70ft x 18ft <b>live</b> <b>room,</b> and three {{isolation}} booths, for vocals, piano, and drums. The group recorded original tracks using Studer 24- and 48-track recorders and transferred {{them to a}} Sony digital recorder. For most songs, MIDI keyboards were played live into a sequencer and left unquantized, while vintage keyboards were recorded to analog tape. Riley said of the process in an interview for Keyboard magazine, [...] "even though we used a sequencer for some stuff, we'd still cut the song live from start to finish. See, the last record was all done with a Synclavier. But this time, we tried to keep it all live and raw." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{group would}} {{typically}} record an album {{in their home}} state of California. However, after constant touring, the band lost focus as Partington explained: [...] "When you're away for a year touring straight, whenever you're home whether you're working or not your mind is like 'yes I'm at home.'" [...] The group decided that to help them focus, they would record in Seattle, Washington. On May 5, 2003, {{it was announced that}} the band was in the studio recording their next album at Robert Lang Studios and TMF with producer Jim Wirt. Wirt and Phil Kaffel acted as engineers, with Justin Armstrong as a secondary engineer with assistance from Geoff Ott. Two days of the recording process consisted of Partington in the <b>live</b> <b>room,</b> tracking one-take run-throughs of each song on guitar. With this approach, Partington improvised a lot of the parts, which yielded [...] "lots of results." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{process of}} {{creating}} the song began in the recording studio one morning at around 4:00a.m., when Timbaland recommended that Furtado should go home because she was tired. Furtado, who had heard that the band U2 (a band she says she deeply admires) wrote many of their songs in the studio control room, said [...] "Really? I'll show you", put on her hoodie and began to [...] "jam". Nate Hills and Timbaland soon joined her, writing and producing as they went, and according to Furtado, this process intensified as she sang. The team used four microphones in the <b>live</b> <b>room</b> and moved them around during recording, about which Furtado said, [...] "...when you listen to it—there's a lot of dimension. It kind of sounds like [...] in another country". Afterwards, they picked the best vocals and [...] "perfected" [...] them, before inserting [...] "reverbs and weird alien sounds" [...] onto them. [...] "e experimented a lot with depth and different sounds", Furtado said of {{the making of the}} song. [...] " [...] affected my vocals a whole lot." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{they wanted}} to {{reproduce}} an older sound, Saadiq and Brunghardt also wanted to capture more of the bass and drum parts to add a louder, modern element to the mix. They applied a more basic approach to miking the instruments and utilizing the outboard gear, using a Neumann U 47 for guitars, alternating overhead microphones for Saadiq's drum kit, a combination of dynamic and condenser mics for the kit's bass drum, and Ampex tape machines for extra warmth to the kit. Brungardt used various standard mics for the snare drum to achieve a more solid cracking sound, rather than capturing the drum's overall tone. Their miking of the guitars' amps was adapted from The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions, and as Brungardt recounted, [...] "It really gave us warmth and character. It allowed the amp to breathe and we got the tones of the amp along with the room. For me, that really opened things up so that I could play with the <b>live</b> <b>room,</b> using different reverbs to get a sound." [...] For Saadiq's bass, they used a DI unit to connect a microphone preamplifier, increased the gain on a plug-in for less compression, and adjusted the low-end tones with an equalizer plug-in.|$|E
500|$|On 3 March 2008, {{recording}} {{started at}} The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, where Stiff Upper Lip was recorded, and lasted [...] for eight weeks. Engineer Mike Fraser, who has mixed all AC/DC albums since The Razors Edge, said they recorded in batches of three songs to [...] "keep things interesting" [...] {{and to avoid}} overextended sessions. According to Fraser, the band had not rehearsed the songs before entering the studio. Despite [...] "a couple of tweaks in the writing, sparkling up the choruses a bit better" [...] during the recording, the compositions were mostly complete. Still, the Young brothers had new ideas during production, including the song [...] "Anything Goes", which was written when the studio sessions were nearly finished. The songs were mostly recorded live in the studio; the instruments and backing vocals were recorded in the <b>live</b> <b>room</b> and the vocals at both the control room and an overdubbing booth. The performances were first recorded with analogue equipment, as Fraser considers that tape conveys [...] "the sound of rock & roll", and then digitised for mixing and overdubs. [...] Fraser tried to not alter the original recordings – [...] "I used Pro-Tools purely as a tape machine" [...] – with no effects on the bass and rhythm guitar, sparse delay and reverb effects on the vocals and other instruments and overdubs were only used for the lead guitar and vocals.|$|E

500|$|Rasmussen's {{first task}} was to adjust and arrange the guitar sound with which the band was dissatisfied. A guide track for the tempos and a click track for Ulrich's {{drumming}} were used. The band played in a <b>live</b> <b>room,</b> recording the instruments separately. Each song used three reels: one for drums, a second for bass and guitars and a third for anything else. Hetfield wrote lyrics during the recording sessions; these were occasionally unfinished as recording began, and Rasmussen said that Hetfield [...] "wasn't really interested in singing" [...] but instead [...] "wanted that hard vibe". Metallica's recording process was new to Jason Newsted, who questioned his impact on the overall sound {{and the lack of}} discussion {{with the rest of the}} team. Newsted had a different experience with his previous band, Flotsam and Jetsam, describing their style as [...] "basically everybody playing the same thing like a sonic wall". He recorded his parts separately from the rest of the band, with only the assistant engineer present. Newsted noted that his parts were at the same audio frequency as Hetfield's guitar parts, and this created a [...] " [...] for the same frequency". Steve Thompson, who mixed the album, claims that Ulrich was squarely to blame for the inaudible bass and unusual drums. Thompson wanted to be relieved of his mixing duties when Ulrich presented his ideas on the production, but Thompson was not allowed to leave and received the majority of the criticism for the misrepresentation of bass of the record.|$|E
500|$|A {{recording}} made at Carfax Tower in Oxford {{provided the}} bell chimes heard {{at the end}} of [...] "Strange Ones". These chimes were only heard on the I Should Coco version, not on Supergrass is 10, because on the I Should Coco album the chimes are used as a transition to the next track, [...] "Sitting Up Straight", which was not included in Supergrass is 10. [...] "Strange Ones" [...] was written about Cowley Road, Oxford, a place where the band once lived. It was originally intended to be the [...] "throwaway song" [...] on the B-side to [...] "Caught by the Fuzz". Another song on the album with the same theme, [...] "I'd Like To Know", was inspired by listening to [...] "Strange Ones" [...] played backwards on tape cassette. Supergrass took this sound, wrote new lyrics for it, and had another song for their album. Gaz Coombes says, [...] "One of the highlights of this album was recording 'Sofa (Of My Lethargy)'.... I remember everybody got in the <b>live</b> <b>room</b> and had an instrument, including Sam [...] on bass, a friend of his on hammond organ and we played the rest, all live, one take.... We made I Should Coco so fast because we wanted to catch the energy and excitement of the songs on tape, and do it before the money ran out!" [...] In a 2005 interview with BBC Radio London Quinn remembered [...] "writing that song [...] in my living room on a rainy day and Gaz sort of turned up with this chord sequence and we just went straight through it and just did it on 4 track".|$|E

2500|$|The songs [...] "Pride (In the Name of Love)", [...] "The Unforgettable Fire", and [...] "A Sort of Homecoming" [...] were {{initially}} composed at Bono's {{house in a}} Martello Tower in Bray Co. Wicklow. Recording for the album began in early May 1984 with a month-long session at Slane Castle, County Meath. Windmill Lane Studios, where they had recorded their first three albums, had no <b>live</b> <b>room,</b> so Slane was chosen instead as a venue where they could record and play live in rooms with good sound quality. The band and crew stayed in the castle, and living together during the sessions fostered a camaraderie. They chose the castle's Gothic ballroom, which was specifically built for music with a 30-foot high domed ceiling, and it provided a relaxed and experimental atmosphere. It proved so relaxed, that one day, the band {{went so far as}} to record naked. [...] "We got into gaffer art", commented Bono. Their approach at Slane was that rather than use effects and reverberation to revitalise usual studio sound, they would do the opposite and use a <b>live</b> <b>room</b> to [...] "tame......wild sound".|$|E
2500|$|This apprenticeship... {{became a}} part of [...] how things were recorded. I started to learn {{microphone}} placements and things like that, what did and what didn't work.

The reality of it is the drum is a musical instrument, it relies on having a bright room and a <b>live</b> <b>room...</b> And so bit by bit I was learning really how not to record.|$|E

2500|$|All of {{the drum}} tracks had been {{recorded}} at The Pool at Miloco Studios in London, {{over the course}} of three weekends in late 2015. The drums were recorded here due to the band's personal studio consisting solely of a control room, a <b>live</b> <b>room,</b> and storage for their equipment. Duce said their studio was [...] "great for close mic stuff but not so good for big room drums." [...] Vocal overdubs and stomps were also recorded. Dan Lancaster produced the sessions here, with assistance from Sam Harper and Jamie McEvoy. Lancaster also engineered the drums, with additional drum engineering by Darren Jones. Jones mentioned that the group originally planned to record a few songs but [...] "liked the sound so much they decided to do the [...] whole album". Following the end of a UK tour in December 2015, the band members went on a six month break to spend time with family.
