5|$|Elle Bishop is {{a fictional}} {{character}} who {{appeared on the}} American psychological thriller science fiction series Heroes, which aired on NBC from 2006 to 2010. The character was created by series creator Tim Kring and portrayed by actress Kristen Bell. Elle was created by Kring {{to act as a}} contrast {{to the rest of the}} characters, who had all recently found out they had abilities, whereas Elle had known her whole life. Bell, who had previously starred in the then recently cancelled series Veronica Mars, was a fan of the series and had met up with the writers that informed her they would <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> her on the show. While the character of Elle was created before Bell was cast, following her casting, the character was slightly altered to better resemble her. Elle was one of the new characters introduced in the second season and according to contract, would continue on the series for at least 13 episodes into season three.|$|E

According to the Austin Statesman, {{one of them}} said, [...] "We’d <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Texas, but they’re still hoping to wind up at the Fiesta Bowl."

500|$|U2 {{announced}} that it would purchase carbon offsets to take into consideration the environmental impact of the large production, which has been estimated to be up to 65,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide; approximately the same amount that would be emitted in flying a passenger plane 34 million miles. In addition to the carbon offsets, the band also set up a page on PickupPal so that people could carpool to concerts in an attempt to lower the carbon footprint. Additionally they launched a fan travel carbon offset program in partnership with Offset Options. Most of the carbon emissions are a result of transporting the three stage structures across Europe and North America. An environmental consultant to carbonfootprint.com noted that to offset the tour's 2009 emissions, the band would have to plant over 20,000 trees. In an interview with BBC Radio, The Edge reiterated that U2 were offsetting their carbon emissions, also stating, [...] "We'd <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> some alternative to big trucks bringing the stuff around but there just isn't one." ...|$|E
500|$|Mary {{became a}} {{domiciliary}} health visitor and midwife, and was on-call day or night, [...] {{where she was}} needed as a midwife. Her eldest son, Paul, said his first memory was watching her cycling away when it was snowing heavily. After she {{had been diagnosed with}} cancer, Mary still carried on cycling to work, but often doubled up in pain and had trouble breathing. The day Mary was due to have a mastectomy operation, she cleaned the McCartney house and laid her two sons' school clothes out, ready for the next day. She said to Dill Mohin, her sister-in-law, [...] "Now everything's ready for them in case I don't come back." [...] Mary died of an embolism on 31 October 1956, after an operation {{to stop the spread of}} breast cancer. Her last words to Dill Mohin were [...] "I would <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> seen the boys growing up." [...] Mary was buried on 3 November 1956 at Yew Tree Cemetery, Finch Lane, Liverpool. Paul later named his daughter Mary after his mother, and Michael released an album entitled Woman in 1972, including the song, [...] "Woman," [...] with a photo of Mary on the front cover.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} has proven popular with viewers and critics {{due to his}} aesthetically pleasing looks. A Daily Star reporter said McGregor's contract was extended because female viewers [...] "went mad for him." [...] Nate Micó of SX News praised the casting of McGregor, saying [...] "As the brooding Detective Mark Brennan, handsome actor Scott McGregor has bought a welcome dose of eye candy to Ramsay Street."

500|$|The {{fourth season}} explores {{the concept of}} Life Model Decoys (LMDs), which were first {{referenced}} in The Avengers, and introduces the character Ghost Rider to the MCU. On why the series waited to begin exploring LMDs, Jed Whedon said that the series previously {{did not want to}} explore the concept before the release of Avengers: Age of Ultron, which sees the introductions of Ultron and Vision in a similar manner to LMDs. On introducing Ghost Rider, Whedon said that [...] "with Doctor Strange coming out this year, the Marvel [...] Universe is moving into new waters," [...] referring to the exploration of magic. [...] "We felt that this was obviously a great character that we'd <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> on our show that we feel fits with that shift." [...] The season also continues storylines from the second season of Agent Carter, with the reveal that the Momentum Energy Labs group is a successor to the Isodyne Energy company, with both companies connected by the parent company Roxxon, a mainstay of the MCU. In August 2017, Emily VanCamp said that discussions had taken place for her to reprise her role of Sharon Carter for the series, but there were conflicts with her starring role on the series Revenge.|$|E
500|$|The season's {{exploring}} of supernatural {{and mystical}} concepts ties-in {{with the release}} of Doctor Strange, the first MCU film to explore magic. In addition to the Darkhold, this includes the introduction of Ghost Rider, with Whedon explaining in July 2016, that [...] "the Marvel [...] Universe is moving into new waters [...] We felt that [...] was obviously a great character that we’d <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> on our show that we feel fits with that shift." [...] Whedon pointed out that the previous tie-ins were sometimes [...] "very direct", and other times [...] "more thematic. The tie this year will feel more of a reflection of , less an interweaving plot." [...] He added, [...] "Hopefully some of the questions that we’re asking will be answered by [...] then pose some new themes and ideas for us to explore." [...] "Deals with Our Devils", aired after the release of Doctor Strange, sees Aida create a portal to rescue Coulson and Fitz from another dimension. The visuals for these are intentionally reminiscent of those used in the film. Bell added that the Darkhold [...] "feels like it belongs in the library in Kathmandu", referring to the Kamar-Taj library seen in Doctor Strange.|$|E

It was produced by the Jonas Brothers and John Fields, with the latter also playing the bass, guitars and keyboards. The song also features Devin Bronson, who provided a guitar solo, and Dorian Crozier, who played the drums. In an interview, Lovato explained that the song is about being yourself when you are surrounded by [...] "the pressures of fame".

The song is just about keeping it real and trying to stay yourself when you're out in Hollywood." [...] "La La Land" [...] was released as the album's second and final single on April 10, 2009.

500|$|Following {{his success}} at Notre Dame, Skip Holtz {{was asked to}} become the {{head coach of the}} Connecticut Huskies. He {{accepted}} the offer and took his first head coaching job on December 23, 1993. He replaced Tom Jackson, who had gone 14–19 {{over the past three years}} and had decided to resign on November 17, 1993. He agreed to a four-year contract at a salary of $95,000 a year. Even though Skip came from a [...] "major football institution" [...] (Notre Dame), University of Connecticut President Dr. Harry J. Hartley said that the hire [...] "should not be seen as a signal that Connecticut intends to upgrade its program." [...] Despite Hartley's remarks, Holtz planned to help elevate the team from I-AA to I-A. Holtz commented on Hartley's remarks by saying [...] "I'd <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the opportunity to coach a Division I team here...." [...] In 1998, UConn, after 100 years of football and five years with Skip Holtz as its head coach, played in its first Division I-AA playoff game. The Huskies scored two fourth-quarter touchdowns to beat Hampton University, 42–34. In the next round of the playoffs, the Huskies lost to the eventual runner-up, Georgia Southern, on December 5. Two days later, Skip resigned as head coach of the Huskies in order to rejoin his father, who had taken the head coaching job at South Carolina the day before the Huskies' loss. As the leader of the Huskies football team, he accumulated a winning percentage of [...]596 (34–23) over five seasons.|$|E
500|$|During {{production}} of Supernaturals first season, Morgan was {{also working on}} the shows Weeds and Grey's Anatomy, so he was often traveling {{back and forth between}} Los Angeles and Vancouver, British Columbia. This interfered at times with Morgan's acting, as he had trouble getting [...] "Winchester-y enough" [...] after portraying the nice character of Denny Duquette on Grey's Anatomy. Morgan commented, [...] "I was stuck in Denny-land, where I was being too nice. Winchester's harder to find. Denny's more me. He's an intense guy, John is. And Denny, for a guy who's having trouble living, he's just a charming dude." [...] Morgan was at first reluctant to return for Supernaturals second season due to his role on Grey's Anatomy. Although he lent his voice for the third season episode [...] "Long-Distance Call," [...] future appearances of Morgan as the character after the second season have been hindered due to the actor's busy schedule. Nevertheless, both Kripke and writer Sera Gamble have stated that they [...] "would <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> him back." [...] The scheduling conflict has continued into the sixth season of Supernatural, with executive producer Robert Singer revealing that the writers had considered bringing the character back in the alternate reality episode [...] "My Heart Will Go On" [...] instead of Ellen Harvelle, but due to concerns {{that they would not be}} able to secure Morgan's return, they ultimately chose Ellen for the deceased character they would have (temporarily) return in the episode. During the {{production of}} the fifth season, Morgan had an interview with MovieWeb in which he stated that no one from the show had contacted him about making another appearance, and expressed the desire to return for at least one more episode in what was then-believed to be the show's final season, as he had enjoying working with on-screen sons Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki and he felt that John's storyline had ended too soon.|$|E
