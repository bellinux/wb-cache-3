5|$|Hump it (or Humping it): During a yell, {{the crowd}} <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> places {{their hands on}} their knees to {{maximize}} the amount of air displaced during the scream. The stance forces the diaphragm to assist the lungs.|$|E
500|$|Unlike many schools, {{which have}} {{a large group of}} cheerleaders to rally their fans during {{sporting}} events, Texas A has five student Yell Leaders. [...] Consisting of three seniors and two juniors, historically all male, the Yell Leaders are elected to their positions annually by the student body. [...] These students do not perform gymnastic feats, but instead use hand signals, known as [...] "pass backs", to direct and intensify crowds. [...] After the signals are passed through the crowd, the Yell Leaders give the signal to [...] "hump it", where the crowd <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> places their hands on their knees to maximize the noise. [...] The Yell Leaders have a dozen yells that they can choose from depending on the situation. [...] While some yells are designed to praise and motivate the team, others exist solely to make fun of the opposing side.|$|E
2500|$|The skiff is {{designed}} for optimum performance and so the technique applied is important. The two fundamental reference points in the stroke are the catch where the blade {{is placed in the}} water, and the 'finish' where the blade is removed from the water. The skiffer <b>leans</b> <b>forward,</b> <b>and</b> bends the legs slightly. After placing the blade vertically in the water at the catch, he or she applies pressure to stretcher, levering the blade in the water on the thole and leans back. This is called the drive phase of the stroke. Once the skiffer has pushed the blade as far forward in the water as possible, he or she extracts the oar from the water, and the recovery phase begins, setting up the skiffer's body for the next stroke. On the recovery, it is normal to tip the blade flat (known as [...] "feathering"). There are some differences from the rowing stroke. The hands must never pass one above the other - one hand must always lead, or one of the blades will [...] "dig" [...] in the water. The seat does not slide and the unbending of the legs follows from the leaning back of the body. Finally skiffs are more stable so {{that it is possible to}} lean back further and keep the blade in the water for longer. The last extra distance provides considerable motive power to the boat, leading to the encouragement to [...] "squeeze the finish".|$|E
60|$|Bateman <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> fixed Edward {{with his}} searching eyes.|$|R
60|$|Laverick hesitating, she <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> {{looked into}} his face.|$|R
60|$|The skipper <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> {{with his}} great hand seized it.|$|R
6000|$|PORTER: [...] "Thank you, miss, thank you. If {{you want}} {{anything}} at all, miss, I'm right dere at de end of de cah." [...] He goes {{out by the}} narrow passage-way beside the smaller enclosed parlor. Miss Galbraith looks askance at the sleeping gentleman, and then, rising, goes to the large mirror, to pin her veil, which has become loosened from her hat. She gives a little start at sight of the gentleman in the mirror, but arranges her head-gear, and returning to her place looks {{out of the window}} again. After a little while she moves about uneasily in her chair, then <b>leans</b> <b>forward,</b> <b>and</b> tries to raise her window; she lifts it partly up, when the catch slips from her fingers, and the window falls shut again with a crash.|$|E
6000|$|It overcomes {{the poor}} woman; she <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> breaks into sobbing,-- a tempest of sorrow, long suppressed, that shakes her weak frame as {{she thinks that}} her husband is out of work, desperate, discouraged, and tempted of the devil, that the rent is falling due, and only the poor pay of her needle to meet it with. In one of those quick flashes which {{concentrate}} through the imagination the sorrows of years, she seems to see her little home broken up, {{her husband in the}} gutter, her children turned into the street. At this moment there goes up from her heart a despairing cry, such as a poor, hunted, tired-out creature gives when brought to the last gasp of endurance. It was like the shriek of the hare when the hounds are upon it. She clasps her hands and cries out, [...] "O my God, help me." ...|$|E
60|$|British {{infantry}} {{keep the}} ground. In front are about fifty Frenchmen in civil dress of every grade of life, workmen and gentlemen, {{in a double}} rank. They are all so wounded that they are back in civil life, but to-day they are to have some solace for their wounds. They lean heavily on sticks, their bodies are twisted and maimed, but their faces are shining with pride and joy. The French General draws his sword and addresses them. One catches words like 'honneur' and 'patrie.' They lean forward on their crutches, hanging on every syllable which comes hissing and rasping from under that heavy white moustache. Then the medals are pinned on. One poor lad is terribly wounded and needs two sticks. A little girl runs out with some flowers. He <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> tries to kiss her, but the crutches slip and he nearly falls upon her. It was a pitiful but beautiful little scene.|$|E
60|$|The {{little woman}} <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> looked at Maraton with undisguised curiosity.|$|R
60|$|He <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> beckoned to Gaston to draw {{his chair}} nearer.|$|R
60|$|Brooks <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> rescued Mr. Bullsom's tie from {{underneath}} his ear.|$|R
60|$|No great {{movement}} {{of the human mind}} takes place without the concurrent beat of those two wings, the imagination and the understanding. It is by the understanding that we are enabled {{to make the most of}} this world, and to use the collected material of experience in its condensed form of practical wisdom; and it is the imagination which forever beckons toward that other world which is always future, and makes us discontented with this. The one rests upon experience; the other <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> listens after the inexperienced, and shapes the features of that future with which it is forever in travail. The imagination might be defined as the common sense of the invisible world, as the understanding is of the visible; and as those are the finest individual characters in which the two moderate and rectify each other, so those are the finest eras where the same may be said of society. In the voyage of life, not only do we depend on the needle, true to its earthly instincts, but upon observation of the fixed stars, those beacons lighted upon the eternal promontories of heaven above the stirs and shiftings of our lower system.|$|E
6000|$|In the old burial-ground, Charter Street, a slate gravestone, carved {{round the}} borders, {{to the memory}} of [...] "Colonel John Hathorne, Esq.," [...] who died in 1717. This was the witch-judge. The stone is sunk deep into the earth, and <b>leans</b> <b>forward,</b> <b>and</b> the grass grows very long around it; and, on account of the moss, it was rather {{difficult}} to make out the date. Other Hathornes lie buried in a range with him on either side. In a corner of the burial-ground, close under Dr. P-----'s garden fence, are the most ancient stones remaining in the graveyard; moss-grown, deeply sunken. One to [...] "Dr. John Swinnerton, Physician," [...] in 1688; another to his wife. There, too, is the grave of Nathaniel Mather, the younger brother of Cotton, and mentioned in the Magnalia as a hard student, and of great promise. [...] "An aged man at nineteen years," [...] saith the gravestone. It affected me deeply, when I had cleared away the grass from the half-buried stone, and read the name. An apple-tree or two hang over these old graves, and throw down the blighted fruit on Nathaniel Mather's grave,--he blighted too. It gives strange ideas, to think how convenient to Dr. P------'s family this burial-ground is,--the monuments standing almost within arm's reach of the side windows of the parlor,--and there being a little gate from the back yard through which we step forth upon those old graves aforesaid. And the tomb of the P. family is right in front, and close to the gate. It is now filled, the last being the refugee Tory, Colonel P------ and his wife. M. P------ has trained flowers over this tomb, on account of her friendly relations with Colonel P------.|$|E
6000|$|MRS. ROBERTS (as wildly {{as one can}} in whisper). No, no, I can't let you. We've made {{ourselves}} the laughing-stock of the whole car already with our mistakes, and I can't go on. I would rather perish than ask him. You don't suppose it could be? No, it couldn't. There may be twenty Willis Campbells in San Francisco, and there probably are. Do you think he looks like me! He has a straight nose; but you can't tell anything about {{the lower part of}} his face, the beard covers it so; and I can't make out the color of his eyes by this light. But of course it's all nonsense. Still if it should be! It would be very stupid of us to ride all the way from Framingham to Boston with that name staring one in the eyes. I wish he would turn it away. If it really turned out to be Willis, he would think we were awfully stiff and cold. But I can't help it; I can't go attacking every stranger I see, and accusing him of being my brother. No, no, I can't, and I won't, and that's all about it. [She <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> addresses the stranger with sudden sweetness.] Excuse me, sir, but I am very much interested by the name on your bag. Not that I think you are even acquainted with him, and there are probably a great many of them there; but your coming from the same city and all does seem a little queer, and I hope you won't think me intrusive in speaking to you, because if you should happen, by the thousandth of a chance, to be the right one, I should be so happy! ...|$|E
60|$|Madame <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> {{whispered in}} the man's ear. Monsieur Louis nodded.|$|R
60|$|I <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> {{touched her}} lips. Then I grasped her hands warmly.|$|R
60|$|Andrea <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> {{his face}} was an evil thing to look upon.|$|R
60|$|Hetty, in her red {{cloak and}} warm bonnet, with her basket in her hand, is turning towards a gate {{by the side}} of the Treddleston road, but not that she may have a more {{lingering}} enjoyment of the sunshine and think with hope of the long unfolding year. She hardly knows that the sun is shining; and for weeks, now, when she has hoped at all, it has been for something at which she herself trembles and shudders. She only wants to be out of the high-road, that she may walk slowly and not care how her face looks, as she dwells on wretched thoughts; and through this gate she can get into a field-path behind the wide thick hedgerows. Her great dark eyes wander blankly over the fields like the eyes of one who is desolate, homeless, unloved, not the promised bride of a brave tender man. But there are no tears in them: her tears were all wept away in the weary night, before she went to sleep. At the next stile the pathway branches off: there are two roads before her--one along by the hedgerow, which will by and by lead her into the road again, the other across the fields, which will take her much farther out of the way into the Scantlands, low shrouded pastures where she will see nobody. She chooses this and begins to walk a little faster, as if she had suddenly thought of an object towards which it was worth while to hasten. Soon she is in the Scantlands, where the grassy land slopes gradually downwards, and she leaves the level ground to follow the slope. Farther on there is a clump of trees on the low ground, and she is making her way towards it. No, it is not a clump of trees, but a dark shrouded pool, so full with the wintry rains that the under boughs of the elder-bushes lie low beneath the water. She sits down on the grassy bank, against the stooping stem of the great oak that hangs over the dark pool. She has thought of this pool often in the nights of the month that has just gone by, and now at last she is come to see it. She clasps her hands round her knees, and <b>leans</b> <b>forward,</b> <b>and</b> looks earnestly at it, as if trying to guess what sort of bed it would make for her young round limbs.|$|E
50|$|Notable {{features}} on the Mustang GT include 20-inch wheels, a nose which <b>leans</b> <b>forward,</b> <b>and</b> a side scoop. For {{the first time in}} the Mustang's nearly 40-year existence, the scoop is a fully integrated design element that creates a triangular opening, and flows forward along the chamfered lower body line.|$|E
50|$|Death Drop: From cuddle position, with {{a circus}} grip. Flyer <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> falls as far a grip allows, {{which is not}} very far. Then the lead slips the cuddle arm out and the flyer falls again {{as far as the}} grip allows. Spotters should be under where the flyer's head will go.|$|E
60|$|Lord Hennibul <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> {{addressed}} Arranmore with blank {{surprise on}} his face.|$|R
60|$|She turned towards Julian. He <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> {{raised her}} fingers to his lips.|$|R
60|$|She {{was silent}} for a moment. Then she <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> touched the window.|$|R
50|$|Pterostylis aenigma, {{commonly}} known as the enigmatic greenhood is a species of orchid endemic to Victoria. It has a rosette of leaves and a single green and white flower which <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> has a brownish point on the end. It is a rare orchid, occurring at only one site with fewer than 100 individual plants and is thought to be a natural hybrid between two species that grow nearby.|$|E
5000|$|Opinions Now with Chris David: Parodies [...] "debate" [...] {{shows like}} Hardball with Chris Matthews. The host is very loud, {{constantly}} <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> glares at the camera, and demands solid answers, {{or at least}} strong opinions, at all times. Taking a jab at modern television news shows, the more level-headed and cautious experts are often ignored in favor of other guests with more extreme and livid views on the subject at hand.|$|E
5000|$|A {{somewhat}} exaggerated {{version of}} the cross-step, sometimes used to deliver an attack in foil or épée, is the flèche ("arrow" [...] in French). In the flèche, the fencer <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> takes a long running cross-step, generating most of the thrust with his/her front leg. Ideally, the hit delivered with a flèche should arrive as or just before the fencer's front foot hits the ground. When (as often happens) the flèching fencer runs past the defender the defender is allowed to finish a defensive action, generally a riposte following a parry.|$|E
60|$|Glinda <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> {{kissed the}} sweet, upturned {{face of the}} loving little girl.|$|R
60|$|Slowly she <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> traced {{on the rug}} {{the figure}} of the Egg itself.|$|R
60|$|The hansom sped {{through the}} crowded streets. Anna {{suddenly}} <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> looked around her.|$|R
5000|$|Soon, the boy {{starts to}} worry about the evil the old man was talking about when all of a sudden, they come upon a boy in a bright white suit. He claims he was at a picnic and got {{separated}} and then lost. They pick him up and take off. Soon it becomes dark and suddenly the boy in the white suit <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> says something to the aunt. The car comes to a stop and dies. The aunt and nephew look back at the boy. Smiling, the boy in the white suit says [...] "Have you ever wondered if there was such a thing as genetic evil in the world?" ...|$|E
50|$|In a loop, the boater does a {{complete}} flip, {{landing in the}} same direction that the move was initiated. Loops are unlike most other moves in that the bow is initiated flat to the water, with no edge. The move is begun like a popup, with the paddler driving straight and flat into the most powerful part of the current on a feature. The boater <b>leans</b> <b>forward,</b> <b>and</b> the bow is swept down and the stern up. Once vertical, the paddler quickly leans backward to pop up out of the water, then powerfully drives forward to intentionally cause the boat to become over-vertical. If done properly, the stern should catch in the current and the boat will return to its starting position.|$|E
50|$|Not {{knowing that}} Colonel von Strohm, Lieutenant Gruber and Private Geerhart {{are the real}} culprits, General von Klinkerhoffen informs them that the {{garrison}} pay truck has been robbed {{and that he has}} caught the thieves, who will be shot by a firing squad. In this way, he complains about the security in the town, which must be strengthened, since field marshal Hermann Göring and Adolf Hitler themselves will be visiting the town on their way along the coastline, where they will boost the morale of the soldiers. The general then <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> tell the others in confidence, {{that it is not the}} real Hitler and Göring, but doubles who resemble them. The real Hitler and Göring would not dare go on such a tour, for fear of being assassinated - by the Germans.|$|E
60|$|Breathlessly interested, Mrs. Milroy <b>leaned</b> <b>forward,</b> <b>and</b> twined {{her hand}} caressingly in her daughter's hair.|$|R
60|$|She <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> {{looked at}} him. Unwillingly {{he turned his}} head to meet her gaze.|$|R
60|$|Louise, for a moment, was startled. Then she <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> {{kissed the}} eager, upturned face.|$|R
