5|$|In Boston, a visibly {{sick man}} from the Netherlands arrives at an office building, only to {{collapse}} and die. The veins in his body erupt with blood, spraying surrounding witnesses. The Fringe team arrive on site, and while interviewing the witnesses, another man also becomes sick. The sick man attempts to <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> only to be stopped by Walter (John Noble), who sees the man spray out blood and realizes there is a contagion. The building is quarantined with Walter's son Peter (Joshua Jackson), FBI agent Olivia (Anna Torv), {{and the rest of}} the witnesses still inside.|$|E
5|$|Newt Lee, {{the night}} watchman, arrived at work shortly before 4:00 and Frank, who was {{normally}} calm, came bustling {{out of his}} office. Frank told Lee {{that he had not}} yet finished his own work and asked Lee to return at 6:00. Newt Lee noticed that Frank was very agitated and asked if he could sleep in the packing room, but Frank was insistent that Lee <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> and told Lee to go out {{and have a good time}} in town before coming back.|$|E
5|$|On 19March 1995, a Mass {{was celebrated}} in the {{reclaimed}} part of the church {{under the direction of}} Papal Nuncio John Bukowski, who delivered Pope John PaulII's blessing to the parish. In a new decision dated 2November 1995, Luzhkov ordered Mosspetspromproyekt to <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> {{by the end of the}} year at the latest. When the order was still not implemented, parish members entered the institute on 2January 1996 and began the removal. Institute director Evgeny Afanasyev called the police once again, but on this occasion, they declined to intervene. Subsequently, the institute director asked the parish priest for a final extension of the removal date by two weeks—Mosspetspromproyekt vacated the building on 13January 1996. On 2February 1996, the Archdiocese of Mother of God at Moscow obtained official permission to use the church indefinitely.|$|E

5|$|From 1969 until 2007, the Nassif Building {{served as}} the {{headquarters}} of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). The building was designed to have removable interior walls to permit easy reconfiguration of the interior space. In November 1970, the federal government exercised its powers of eminent domain and seized control of the three-story basement parking garage from Nasif in order to provide inexpensive parking for DOT workers. Over the years, so many government workers complained of ailments while working in the structure that some believed it suffered from sick building syndrome. David Nassif Associates, owner of the building, disputed these claims. However, when the Department of Transportation announced it would <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> in 2000, the owners promised a $100 million renovation that included a new air ventilation and cleaning system as an inducement for the agency to stay. The owners also unsuccessfully sued the General Services Administration in 1999 to force it to renew the federal lease on the building. The Department of Transportation completed their move out of the Nassif Building and into their new headquarters in June 2007.|$|E

The Paradise Circus site was {{sold by the}} Council in 1998 to Argent Group, this spelt an end to Central Library.|$|E
25|$|Additional armed police {{officers}} arrived. An air ambulance from London HEMS attended the scene, landing in Parliament Square.

25|$|The CIRS {{building}} {{is designed to}} be net positive in four ways environmentally, meaning the processes or products that <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> are more environmentally friendly than those that go into it. The best example of the building's net positivity is the building's wood holds nearly 600 tons of carbon – more carbon than the building's construction and maintenance created.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{definite}} {{record as}} to who gave the order to begin shelling the Four Courts. Historians have only presumed that it was Collins. There is only anecdotal evidence as to how and when the ultimatum was served on the anti-Treaty garrison, whether adequate time was allowed the Four Courts men to surrender, or whether shelling began precipitately while the garrison was loading up their arms to <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> Further study {{remains to be done}} on this most critical event of 1922, which actually started the Civil War in earnest.|$|E
25|$|From an {{architectural}} standpoint, {{the layout of}} the station was very well-designed. One unusual feature was the below-grade entrance leading to the station house located on an island platform between the northbound and southbound tracks. Commuters on the line were able to enter and <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> with no problems and the station house protected them from the elements when necessary. The proximity to New York was a strong point of the station and the area, with commuters able to reach the southernmost point of Manhattan within fifty-three minutes or less.|$|E

25|$|Some {{time after}} the war, pacifists found an {{alternative}} interpretation of the white feather {{as a symbol of}} peace. The apocryphal story goes that in 1775, Quakers in a Friends meeting house in Easton, New York were faced by a tribe of Indians on the war path. Rather than flee, the Quakers fell silent and waited. The Indian chief came into the meeting house and finding no weapons he declared the Quakers as friends. On leaving he took a white feather from his quiver and attached it to the door as a sign to <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> unharmed.|$|E
25|$|Night falls, and {{she exits}} {{the car in}} Chinatown, London, pursued by an unknown man. She runs through an alley, and kisses a man, {{dragging}} him into a nearby building. She removes her jacket, revealing the black mini-dress, and dances seductively next to a motorcycle. They then both <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> with the man driving the motorcycle, and stop in a crowded street. Minogue dances {{on the back of}} the motorcycle, and in the middle of the street, while the man circles her, performing a wheelie. The video ends with the crowd looking on, as the pair perform a burnout, and leave the alley.|$|E
25|$|At 2.30 pm, {{the police}} {{set fire to}} the {{building}} {{to try to make the}} rest of the Kelly Gang <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> Father Gibney ignored the police and went into the burning building. He found Dan Kelly and Steve Hart dead in a back room of the hotel. He said their bodies were lying side by side, their heads resting on blankets. Byrne's body was dragged out of the hotel, but the bodies of Hart and Kelly were badly burned during the fire. People who saw the burned and blackened bodies were only able to tell which was Dan Kelly and which was Steve Hart by their size. They were placed on sheets of bark from a tree and photographed. Three Glenrowan people held hostage inside the hotel died during the siege.|$|E

25|$|On October 21, 1835, a mob {{of several}} {{thousand}} surrounded the building housing Boston's anti-slavery offices, where Garrison had agreed to address {{a meeting of the}} Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society after the fiery British abolitionist George Thompson was unable to keep his engagement with them. Mayor Theodore Lyman persuaded the women to <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> but when the mob learned that Thompson was not within, they began yelling for Garrison. Lyman was a staunch anti-abolitionist but nonetheless wanted to avoid bloodshed and suggested Garrison escape by a back window while Lyman told the crowd Garrison was gone. The mob spotted and apprehended Garrison, tied a rope around his waist, and pulled him through the streets towards Boston Common, calling for tar and feathers. The mayor intervened and had Garrison arrested and rushed off to the Leverett Street Jail for his own protection.|$|E
25|$|On Monday 20 March 1972, at 11.45 a.m., a local carpet dealer {{received}} {{a telephone call}} with a warning that a bomb would explode in Belfast city centre's Church Street which was crowded with shoppers, office workers on lunch breaks, and schoolchildren. British Army troops and the RUC were alerted and immediately began to evacuate the people into nearby Lower Donegall Street. The second call to the Irish News newspaper seven minutes later also gave Church Street as the location for the device. When a final call came at 11.55 advising the Unionist News Letter newspaper that the bomb was instead placed outside its offices in Lower Donegall Street to where the crowds were being sent, the warning arrived {{too late for the}} security forces to clear the street. The staff working inside the News Letter were told by the caller that they had 15 minutes in which to <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> but they {{never had a chance to}} evacuate.|$|E
25|$|On June 5, 1946, a fire {{broke out}} in the hotel, killing 61 people, many of them children. The fire began in the Silver Grill Cocktail Lounge on the lower floor on the La Salle Street side {{adjacent}} to the lobby before ascending stairwells and shafts The fire started either in the walls or in the ceiling according to the Chicago Fire Department around 12:15a.m. but they did not receive their first notification of the fire until 12:35a.m. The fire quickly spread through the highly-varnished wood paneling in the lounge and the mezzanine balcony overlooking the lobby. While a significant number died from flames, a greater number of deaths were caused by suffocation from the thick, black smoke. Around 900 guests were able to <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> but some 150 had to be rescued by the fire services and by heroic members of the public, including two sailors who were reported to have rescued 27 people between them. Two-thirds of hotel fire deaths in 1946 occurred in the La Salle and Winecoff (Atlanta) fires. The hotel fire was so devastating, it resulted in the Chicago city council enacting new hotel building codes and fire-fighting procedures, including the installation of automatic alarm systems and instructions of fire safety inside the hotel rooms.|$|E

500|$|New Jerusalem Laura's addict {{counseling}} {{methods were}} influenced by those of One Day at a Time, founded by the Rev. Henry Wells. For the first 60days of their stay, recovering addicts are prohibited from contacting the outside world, must surrender their cigarettes, and must be escorted if they <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> During this time, residents occupy their time with chores, community service, meetings, and Bible studies. Less {{than half of all}} people who enter the program remain after the first 60days. [...] After the first 60days, residents' actions are less tightly restricted; however, they are still required to participate in the chores, Bible studies, and meetings. Residents graduate from the program after sixmonths.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Darryl Weaver {{attempts}} to browbeat Skinner, threatening to light {{one of the}} toxic cigarettes. As Weaver {{attempts to}} <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> Skinner shoots Weaver's shoulder and the pane of glass behind him, leaving him injured and covered in glass. He drops his cigarette {{to the floor and}} Skinner dramatically snuffs it out with his shoe. Back at the hospital, Scully realizes that nicotine might save Mulder’s life. She is correct in her solution, noting that Weaver’s nicotine tolerance didn’t allow the tobacco beetles to develop in his lungs. Scully administers nicotine to Mulder, who in turn recovers, albeit with a sore throat, as well as a minor addiction to nicotine, which drives him to buy a pack of Morley cigarettes for himself. [...] Chided by Scully, he throws them out, but then stares at them pensively after she leaves.|$|E
500|$|Declared [...] "eyesore of the year" [...] by The Philadelphia Inquirer in 1994, the burned, empty {{tower was}} {{an embarrassment to}} the city {{according}} to an editorial in The Inquirer. The editorial said the feeling only became worse after One Meridian Plaza {{could be seen in}} the background in the film Philadelphia. The fire left the area a commercial void. Nearly every major store in the area closed and property values fell. Neighboring property owners, such as the owner of the damaged buildings behind One Meridian Plaza, were waiting for a decision {{on the future of the}} building before going through with their own development plans. In 1996 the city of Philadelphia sued E/R Partners saying One Meridian Plaza was an environmental hazard and should be demolished or repaired. The city and Mayor Ed Rendell were afraid that when E/R Partners settled with Aetna they would take the money and <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> unfixed.|$|E
