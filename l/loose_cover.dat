500|$|The {{first single}} {{released}} from the album was [...] "What You Waiting For?", which debuted atop the ARIA Singles Chart, charted at number 47 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and reached the top ten on most other charts. The song served to explain why Stefani produced a solo album and discusses her fears in leaving No Doubt for a solo career {{as well as her}} desire to have a baby. [...] "Rich Girl" [...] was released as the album's second single. A duet with rapper Eve, and produced by Dr. Dre, it is an adaptation of a 1990s pop song by British musicians Louchie Lou & Michie One, which itself is a very <b>loose</b> <b>cover</b> lyrically but closer melodically of [...] "If I Were a Rich Man", from the musical Fiddler on the Roof. [...] "Rich Girl" [...] proved successful on several formats, and reached the US and UK top ten. The album's third single [...] "Hollaback Girl" [...] became Stefani's first US and second Australian number-one single; it reached top ten elsewhere. The song was the first US music download to sell more than one million copies, and its brass-driven composition remained popular throughout 2005. The fourth single [...] "Cool" [...] was released shortly following the popularity of its predecessor, reaching the top 20 in US and UK. The song's lyrics and its accompanying music video, filmed in Lake Como, Italy, depict Stefani's former relationship with Kanal.

60|$|True to form, Tarzan at once {{dropped to}} {{his hands and knees}} and searched beneath the bed for the lost gold piece. Strange as it might appear, he had never before looked beneath the bed. He found the gold piece, and {{something}} else he found, too--a small wooden box with a <b>loose</b> <b>cover.</b> Bringing them both out he returned the sovereign to its bag and the bag to its shelf within the cupboard; then he investigated the box. It contained a quantity of cylindrical bits of metal, cone-shaped at one end and flat at the other, with a projecting rim. They were all quite green and dull, coated with years of verdigris.|$|E
50|$|The {{entire process}} {{would have taken}} days to {{complete}} and consequently, {{this was one of}} Morris & Co.'s most expensive cottons. Customers were not put off by the high price, however, and Strawberry Thief proved to be one of Morris's most commercially successful patterns. This printed cotton furnishing textile was intended to be used for curtains or draped around walls (a form of interior decoration advocated by William Morris), or for <b>loose</b> <b>covers</b> on furniture.|$|R

60|$|Then {{the sounds}} of man's {{activity}} suddenly commenced, for there was a clatter forward where the Spaniards flung the <b>loose</b> <b>covers</b> from the hatch, and a harsh rattle of chain mingled with the soft patter of their naked feet. In another few moments a sharp, musical clinking broke out, and Austin saw Tom, who {{had served as a}} steamer's donkey-man, straighten his bent back when a rush of white vapour whirled with a strident hissing about the locomotive boiler, which now drove the winch. He grinned at Austin, and glanced at the misty creek, far down which a faint screaming was dying away.|$|R

40|$|Oats {{have been}} among the five or six leading crops in acreage grown in Utah since its settlement. For many years Swedish Select has been by far the most {{predominant}} variety. This variety is well adapted to Utah conditions, but because of its high susceptibility to <b>loose</b> and <b>covered</b> smut, it is not the most desirable. In 1934, after extensive trials, the variety, Markton, which is resistant to <b>loose</b> and <b>covered</b> smuts, was introduced into the state to replace Swedish Select. In those trials, Markton averaged 13 percent higher in acre yield than Swedish Select. Markton possessed one drawback in that it had a yellowish kernel, whereas Swedish Select produced a large white kernel. As a result of this, Markton has never been grown extensively in the state. Uton, which is a selection from the Markton x Swedish Select cross, is a high-yielding variety resistant to both <b>loose</b> and <b>covered</b> smuts, and yet produces a large white kernel similar to that of Swedish Select. The good qualities of both Swedish Select and Markton appear to have been combined in Uton...|$|R

50|$|The Romans {{also used}} a daybed for {{reclining}} {{in the daytime}} and to sleep on at night. Developed from the Greek prototype, the Roman daybed was designed with legs carved in wood or cast bronze. The Romans also adapted a chaise longue style chair for the accubatio (the act of reclining during a meal). At Roman banquets, the usual number of persons occupying each bed was three, with three daybeds forming three sides of a small square, so that the triclinium (the dining-room of a Roman residence) allowed for a party of nine. The Romans did not practice upholstery, so the couches were made comfortable with pillows, <b>loose</b> <b>covers</b> and animal skins.|$|R

5000|$|Col. Symington, in {{a letter}} to the Ordnance Department two days after the explosion, speculated that it had been caused [...] "by the leaking out of powder when one of the barrels was being placed on the platform." [...] In fact the problem of leaking barrels seemed to be the one point of {{agreement}} among all the witnesses. Alexander McBride, the Superintendent of the Lab, had repeatedly complained that the powder shipped by Dupont and Company was delivered in defective barrels with <b>loose</b> <b>covers.</b> Symington was suspicious that the [...] "parties shipping powder may have used barrels more than once for the shipment of powder, as the barrels have been returned to them at their request." [...] But in the end, the final word still belongs to the Army inquiry and the exact cause remains unknown. Symington himself was sent on retirement the next year.|$|R
