Fullen's study of the Sarah Peralta site in Louisiana [...] found that the OCR method served as {{an effective means of}} inferring time at the site in the absence of radiometrically dateable charcoal. He concludes that whereas debate remains concerning the OCR procedure, [...] "the well-corroborated dates that the LSU Museum of Natural Science has had returned on material processed with OCR and conventional radiocarbon dating...the dates returned on material from Zone 3 will be considered accurate until such time that OCR dating is proven invalid."

Reproduction made possi-ble by Special Collections, University of Arizona Library [...] these Indians live free from drunkenness, more so than others. Only during the season of the pitahaya, in such localities where it may be found, do they happen to make wine out of it. This might last them two or three days. They do not use it to the excess that other nations do. -Father Juan Velarde, S. J., writing in 1716 -When I'itoigave the Indian people the saguaro cactus wine, {{he gave it to}} them for only two days, to have a dizzy effect for only two days, to use as medication. l'itoi knew that to stay dizzy for days was not good for man. Anglos made wine for every day. Now the Indian people stay drunk for days. When our god gave the cactus wine, it was for a sacred purpose, not to abuse it. Even the women were allowed to take a sip during the feast day for medication. Now the Indian women lie to themselves. When they take a drink, they say it is for their medication. Next day, there they were, passed out from over medication. -Papago elder, speaking in 1979 - 64 Desert Plants 2 (1) The following is a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>published</b> <b>references</b> re-lating to the use made of the saguaro cactus (Cereus giganteus or Carnegiea gigantea) by members of the various Indian groups whose aboriginal territories encompass this outstanding plant of the Sonoran Desert.

40|$|Due to chiral {{supersymmetry}} the (nonzero mode) spectral and symmetry {{properties of}} a 4 -dimensional, self-dual Dirac-Yang-Mills operator can be recovered {{from those of}} the corresponding scalar Laplacian D^ 2. It is shown that a similar result holds for higher spins, and that in the 4 -vector case the super-symmetric partners are -D^ 21 _ 4 and the fluctuation operator. The reduction to D^ 2 is used to simplify previous analyses of the (nonzero mode) spectrum of and of the fluctuations for a BPS-monopole, and to explain the Kepler and su(2 / 2) (super) symmetries of a system studied recently by D'Hoker and Vinet.
