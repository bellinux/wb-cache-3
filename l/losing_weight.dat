30|$|Another {{important}} {{finding of}} this study was that level of education was found to be associated to ever trying to <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> and engaging in exercise to <b>lose</b> <b>weight.</b> Interestingly, those having low level of education were more likely than those having high level of education to report ever trying to <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> and participating in exercise to <b>lose</b> <b>weight.</b> Contrary findings {{have been reported in the}} general population in which the perception of trying to <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> increased with increasing level of education (Bish et al. 2005; Kruger et al. 2004; Serdula et al. 1999). Inconsistent associations between level of education and perception of trying to <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> and adopting weight management behaviours have been reported in diabetes populations. While some studies have reported the perception of trying to <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> and participation in weight management behaviours, to increase with increasing educational levels (Agborsangaya et al. 2013; Zhao et al. 2009), others have either reported findings similar to ours (Gurka et al. 2006) or have found no association at all (Dorsey and Songer 2011).|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{examined}} whether {{factors associated}} with attempting to <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> in a hospital-based employee workforce varied by race/ethnicity. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in 6 hospitals in a health system in central Massachusetts. The stratified random sample included 813 employees; men and and non-White employees were oversampled. The primary outcome measure was current evidence-based weight loss attempts. RESULTS: Factors positively associated with attempting to <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> among non-Hispanic Blacks included self-perceived overweight, female sex, higher education, physician recommendation to <b>lose</b> <b>weight,</b> and having a chronic medical condition. Among Hispanics, body mass index and self-perceived overweight were associated with attempts to <b>lose</b> <b>weight,</b> while working full time and second or third shift were associated with lower likelihood of weight loss attempts. Among non-Hispanic Whites, self-perceived overweight, female sex, higher education, and physician recommendation to <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> were positively associated with attempting to <b>lose</b> <b>weight,</b> while working full time and working third shift were negatively associated. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of overweight and obesity were high among hospital employees. Findings suggest that {{factors associated with}} attempting to <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> vary across racial and ethnic groups.

5|$|The balloon {{had carried}} {{a lot of}} food, of a kind adapted more for a balloon voyage than for travels on foot. Andrée had {{reasoned}} that {{they might as well}} throw excess food overboard as sand, if <b>losing</b> <b>weight</b> was necessary; and if it was not, the food would serve if wintering in the Arctic desert did after all become necessary. There was therefore less ballast and large amounts of heavy-type provisions, 767kg (1690lb) altogether, including 200liters of water and some crates of champagne, port, beer, etc., donated by sponsors and manufacturers. There was also lemon juice, though not as much of this precaution against scurvy as other polar explorers usually thought necessary. Much of the food was in the form of cans of pemmican, meat, sausages, cheese, and condensed milk. By the time they crashed, they had thrown some of it overboard. The three men took most of the rest with them on leaving the crash site, along with other necessities such as guns, tent, ammunition, and cooking utensils, making a load on each sled of more than 200kg (440lb). This was not realistic, as it broke the sleds and wore out the men. After one week, they sorted out and left behind a big pile of food and non-essential equipment, bringing the loads down to 130kg per sled. It became more necessary than ever to hunt for food. They shot and ate seals, walruses, and especially polar bears throughout the march.|$|E
40|$|IntroductionApproximately 40 % {{of women}} of childbearing age report that they are {{attempting}} to <b>lose</b> <b>weight.</b> No professional medical organization recommends attempting to <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> during pregnancy because of the possible risks to both mother and baby. Since half of all pregnancies are unintended, women may attempt to <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> before they know they are pregnant, and some women may continue or initiate weight loss attempts even after they know they are pregnant. This study examines the extent to which pregnant women report attempting to <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> and associated sociodemographic and health characteristics. MethodsWe used aggregated multiple-year data (1996 - 2003) from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to assess the prevalence of attempting to <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> among pregnant women {{and the extent to which}} sociodemographic and health characteristics are associated with the behavior. ResultsThe prevalence of attempting to <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> during pregnancy was 8. 1 %. Attempting to <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> during pregnancy was associated with age 35 - 44 years, Hispanic ethnicity, obesity, alcohol consumption, and mental distress during the previous month. ConclusionA substantial proportion of pregnant women attempt to <b>lose</b> <b>weight.</b> Preconception and prenatal care should include counseling women to achieve a healthy weight before becoming pregnant, to maintain healthy weight during pregnancy, and not to attempt weight loss during pregnancy. Further research should be conducted to understand how attempting weight loss during pregnancy translates into dietary change and weight loss and associated maternal and fetal outcomes...|$|R

This study examined physical activity (PA) levels and dietary habits of health clinic workers who were and who were not trying to <b>lose</b> <b>weight.</b> Participants were 64 community health clinic workers (58 females and 6 males). Moderate-to-vigorous intensity (MVI) time spent in PA was assessed by triaxial accelerometry over 7 consecutive days.

40|$|Background: Although {{weight loss}} {{improves}} {{risk factors for}} cardiovascular and metabolic disease, {{it is unclear whether}} inten-tional weight loss reduces mortality rates. Objective: To examine the relationships among intention to <b>lose</b> <b>weight,</b> weight loss, and all-cause mortality. Design: Prospective cohort study using a probability sample of the U. S. population. Setting: Interviewer-administered survey. Participants: 6391 overweight and obese persons (body mass index> 25 kg/m 2) who were at least 35 years of age. Measurements: Intention to <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> and weight change during the past year were assessed by self-report in 1989. Vital status was followed for 9 years. Hazard rate ratios (HRRs) were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, education, smoking, health status, health care utilization, and initial body mass index. Results: Compared with persons not trying to <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> and reporting no weight change, those reporting intentional weight loss had a 24 % lower mortality rate (HRR, 0. 76 [95 % CI, 0. 60 to 0. 97]) and those with unintentional weight loss had a 31 % higher mortality rate (HRR, 1. 31 [CI, 1. 01 to 1. 70]). However, mortality rates were lower in persons who reported trying to <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> than those in not trying to <b>lose</b> <b>weight,</b> independent of actual weight change. Compared with persons not trying to <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> and reporting no weight change, persons trying to <b>lose</b> <b>weight</b> had the following HRRs: no weight change, 0. 80 (CI, 0. 65 to 0. 99); gained weight, 0. 94 (CI, 0. 65 to 1. 37); and lost weight, 0. 76 (CI, 0. 60 to 0. 97). Conclusions: Attempted weight loss is associated with lower all-cause mortality, independent of weight change. Self-reported intentional weight loss is associated with lower mortality rates, and weight loss is associated with higher mortality rates only if it is unintentional.
