The one-day series went slightly better, with Bangladesh A winning two, losing one and abandoning a fourth, but for a second string national team against mainly second elevens from English domestic cricket, it was a highly disappointing tour.|$|E

[...] Although Dead Man's Chest was written to propel the trilogy's plot, Sparrow's state-of-mind as he is pursued by Davy Jones becomes increasingly edgy, and the writers concocted the cannibal sequence to show that he was in danger whether on land or at sea. Sparrow is perplexed over his attraction to Elizabeth Swann, and attempts to justify it throughout the film.|$|E
500|$|Mary {{served as}} regent of the Netherlands {{so well that}} Charles forced her to retain the post and granted her more powers than their aunt had enjoyed. Unlike her aunt, Mary was deeply unhappy during her tenure as {{governor}} and never enjoyed her role. In May 1531, having governed for only four months, Mary told her brother Ferdinand the experience was <b>like</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> rope around her neck. While Margaret had been considered truly feminine, flexible, adaptable, humorous and charming, Mary was unyielding and authoritarian.

500|$|Sharma was {{recommended}} {{for the part}} of AJ by Nitin Ganatra (Masood) after the character was described to him, because producers wanted AJ and Masood to be funny together. The two actors had previously performed in comedy together in short film The Drop, Channel 4's Meet the Magoons and a programme called To Eat with Your Fingers, so Ganatra thought Sharma would be perfect for the role {{and he was the}} first person he thought of. Ganatra and the producers went through ideas of how a brother would affect Masood and what their relationship would be. Ganatra explained that he thought Masood only had one brother until he was told about AJ. When Sharma and Ganatra performed a scene together at Sharma's audition, the dialogue came so naturally to them that producers thought they were improvising, but, as Ganatra explained, they [...] "know each other's style [...] have all these shortcuts. It's <b>like</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> real brother." [...] Sharma was offered the part immediately after his interview. Sharma added in March 2013: [...] "I've known Nitin for years and he really lobbied for me to get the role of AJ, and as soon as I finished my audition the producers offered me the part and asked if I wanted a cup of tea, to which I replied, 'Yes please, I've waited 20 years for that cup of tea', but it's been really nice to just jump onto a set with someone I've already bonded with—it's <b>like</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> pre-built family to bounce off." [...] He had also previously worked with his co-stars Nina Wadia (Zainab) and Marc Elliott (Syed Masood), so felt it was [...] "cool" [...] and [...] "familiar" [...] to work with them. Sharma revealed in an interview with Inside Soap that his own mother always thought he should play Masood's brother after watching EastEnders for many years. The first scene Sharma filmed was with Ganatra on the set outside The Queen Victoria public house, and he found it [...] "really surreal".|$|E
500|$|According to Kahn, Spears pitched him her {{original}} concept, which included all the main elements {{used in the}} final version.

He added that, [...] "'Toxic' was a crystallization of her career at that time, [...] There are elements and moments of that I felt could [...] improved. [...] {{is a bit more}} fashion-forward". About how the concept of the video related to their previous work, Kahn commented that [...] "It's just a great girl fantasy. There are things she's really good at, <b>like</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> really natural knack for knowing what girls want. [...] It's a much more mature sound and much more mature lyrics, and she always has the greatest ideas. She's hyper-aware of pop culture".|$|E

[...] He was profoundly affected by the spectacle of bullfighting, writing, It isn't just brutal like they always told us.

It's just <b>like</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> ringside seat at the war with nothing going to happen to you. He demonstrated what he considered the purity in the culture of bullfighting—called afición—and presented it as an authentic way of life, contrasted against the inauthenticity of the Parisian bohemians.

500|$|Occasionally, Kraft {{intervened in}} order to ensure that his {{conception}} of the flight director's authority was maintained. By the time that the Apollo 7 mission flew, he had been promoted to head of the flight operations division; thus, it was Glynn Lunney who served as lead flight director and had to deal directly with behavior by the crew that Kraft considered [...] "insubordinate". As Kraft commented in his memoirs, [...] "it was <b>like</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> ringside seat at the Wally Schirra Bitch Circus." [...] Mission commander Wally Schirra, annoyed by last-minute changes in the crew's schedule and suffering from a bad cold, repeatedly refused to accept orders from the ground. Although Schirra's actions were successful in the short term, Kraft decreed in consultation with astronaut chief Deke Slayton that none of the Apollo 7 crew would fly again. However, Schirra had decided before the flight that he would retire after Apollo 7.|$|E
500|$|Swift {{uses her}} life {{experiences}} as an inspiration in her work. In her songs, Swift often addresses the [...] "anonymous crushes of {{her high school}} years" [...] and celebrities. Swift frequently criticizes ex-boyfriends, an aspect of her songwriting downplayed by The Village Voice: [...] "Being told What Songs Mean is <b>like</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> really pushy professor. And it imperils a true appreciation of Swift's talent, which is not confessional, but dramatic." [...] However, New York believes the media scrutiny over her decision to [...] "mine her personal life for music … is sexist, inasmuch as it's not asked of her male peers". The singer herself has said that not all her songs are factual {{and that they are}} sometimes based on observations. Aside from her liner note clues, Swift tries not to talk about song subjects specifically [...] "because these are real people.

500|$|J. Broad {{wrote that}} the phrase [...] "have a nice day" [...] is an apt middle ground for the [...] "drop dead" [...] the cashier is {{thinking}} and the [...] "come back soon" [...] the owner wants. Broad stated that the phrase is meaningless {{because it has been}} castrated by excessive usage and pretense. He compared the phrase to the salutation [...] "How are you?" [...] and the phrase [...] "had a lovely time", which are [...] "conversational space-fillers" [...] that help prevent embarrassing silences. Usage of the term has been compared to inserting the phrase [...] "you know" [...] or the word [...] "like" [...] in sentences.

500|$|Location {{scouting}} {{revealed a}} former Wall Street bank {{that had been}} closed down and repurposed as a cigar bar.

[...] "But everything ended up going very smoothly. We shot {{in the heart of}} Wall Street in a bank that had been closed down. It was <b>like</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> back lot in the middle of Wall Street." [...] An office at the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House doubled as the office of Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer). Plummer believed that the office's design was essential to his character: [...] "The space literally presents Case’s power, so I found that part of my character was to simply play very cool about everything. You don’t have to push the power, because it’s all around you." [...] The location was also used to film a scene where Frazier confronts Madeleine White (Jodie Foster). The American Tract Society building, located at 150 Nassau Street and Spruce Street, Manhattan, doubled as White's office. Cafe Bravo, a coffee shop located at 76 Beaver Street and Hanover Street, was also used for filming. Other filming locations included Battery Park and the New York Supreme Court House's Appellate Division located at East 25th Street and Madison Avenue, Manhattan.|$|E
500|$|Never Let Me Gos {{score was}} {{composed}} by British composer Rachel Portman. She worked on Never Let Me Gos music for four months. Portman {{said that because}} of the film's sad themes, she wanted to [...] "put some hope" [...] and humanity into the music. It was important to her that there be a [...] "real emotional heartbeat {{in the midst of this}} story." [...] Believing that a [...] "huge sweeping score" [...] would not have fit Never Let Me Go, she instead worked with a smaller orchestra of no more than 48 players. At the urgent request of the director and the producers, she tried other approaches, such as the use of a child's voice and what was described as a [...] "big finale cue." [...] In the end, they went for a simpler and more subtle approach. Stating that most of the score was written for piano, strings and harp, with solos for violin and cello, she called her score something of a [...] "chamber piece". [...] "If you use a solo instrument, it's <b>like</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> voice", she says. [...] "It highlights the emotion." [...] But, she adds, [...] "the violin is played with virtually no vibrato, because I didn't ever want it to sound sentimental". She notes that [...] "for my own taste, I stay on the side of restraint, because I think it works better in film". Her work on Never Let Me Go earned her a San Diego Film Critics Society Award for Best Score.|$|E

Aside from unknown models, featured in the book are actress Isabella Rossellini, rappers Big Daddy Kane and Madonna's then boyfriend Vanilla Ice, model Naomi Campbell, gay porn star Joey Stefano, actor Udo Kier, socialite Tatiana von Fürstenberg, and nightclub owner Ingrid Casares; however the heterosexual photos in the book involve only Madonna and Vanilla Ice. Madonna herself is featured partially or completely naked. One of the book's most famous photographs shows Madonna hitchhiking completely naked in Miami. The book also reflects a great part on Dita's perspective towards her own sexuality. Dita writes in Sex that her [...] "pussy" [...] is a temple of learning and that exposing it, is really a homage to it ("It's hard to describe it smells like a baby to me fresh and full of life. I love my pussy, it is the complete summation of my life"). Sex contains statements like [...] "ass fucking is the most pleasurable way to get fucked and it hurts the most too". Others include [...] "here is something comforting about being tied up. Like {{when you were a}} baby and your mother strapped you in the car seat. She wanted you to be safe. It was an act of love" [...] and [...] "I wouldn't want a penis. It would be <b>like</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> third leg. it seems like a contraption that would get in the way.

500|$|In the 1967 NBA Finals, the Sixers were {{pitted against}} Chamberlain's old team, the San Francisco Warriors of his {{one-time}} backup Nate Thurmond and star forward Rick Barry. The Sixers {{won the first}} two games, with Chamberlain and Greer taking credit for respectively defensive dominance and clutch shooting, but San Francisco won two of the next three games, so Philadelphia was up 3–2 prior to Game 6. In Game 6, the Warriors were trailing 123–122 with 15 seconds left. For the last play, Thurmond and Barry were assigned to do a pick and roll against Chamberlain and whoever would guard Barry. However, the Sixers foiled it: when Barry ran past Thurmond's pick {{and drove to the}} basket, he was picked up by Chet Walker, making it impossible to shoot; Thurmond was covered by Chamberlain, which made it impossible to pass. Barry botched his shot attempt, and the Sixers won the championship. Chamberlain said: [...] "It is wonderful {{to be a part of}} the greatest team in basketball... being a champion is <b>like</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> big round glow inside of you." [...] He contributed with 17.7 ppg and 28.7 rpg against fellow future Hall-of-Fame pivot Nate Thurmond, never failing to snare at least 23 rebounds in the six games. Chamberlain himself described the team as the best in NBA history. In 2002, writer Wayne Lynch wrote a book about this remarkable Sixers season, Season of the 76ers, centering on Chamberlain. In the 1967–68 NBA season, matters began to turn sour between Chamberlain and the Sixers' sole surviving owner, Irv Kosloff. This conflict had been going along for a while: in 1965, Chamberlain asserted that he and the late Richman had worked out a deal which would give the center 25% of the franchise once he ended his career. Although there is no written proof for or against, ex-Sixers coach Dolph Schayes and Sixers lawyer Alan Levitt assumed Chamberlain was right; in any case, Kosloff declined the request, leaving Chamberlain livid and willing to jump to the rival ABA once his contract ended in 1967. Kosloff and Chamberlain worked out a truce, and later signed a one-year, $250,000 contract.|$|E
