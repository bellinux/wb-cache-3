25|$|Polyploidy, {{where there}} are more than two sets of {{homologous}} chromosomes in the cells, occurs mainly in plants. It has been of major significance in plant evolution according to Stebbins. The proportion of flowering plants which are polyploid was estimated by Stebbins to be 30–35%, but in grasses the average is much higher, about 70%. Polyploidy in <b>lower</b> <b>plants</b> (ferns, horsetails and psilotales) is also common, and some species of ferns have reached levels of polyploidy far in excess of the highest levels known in flowering plants.Polyploidy in animals is much less common, but it has been significant in some groups.Polyploid series in related species which consist entirely of multiples of a single basic number are known as euploid.|$|E
25|$|The Braunton Burrows {{core area}} {{consists}} of fixed and mobile sand dune systems with geomorphological and successional processes. There are also variable-flooded slacks, grassland and scrub further inland supporting {{a wide variety}} of flowering and <b>lower</b> <b>plants,</b> birds, and insects. It includes the complete successional range of dune plant communities, with over 400 vascular plant species. It is characterised by marram grass (Ammophila arenaria), round-headed club-rush (Scirpoides holoschoenus), sharp rush (Juncus acutus), and willow (Salix) species. On the strandline there is rock sea lavender (Limonium binervosum). The fore and mid dunes are generally sandy yellow dunes, colonised and stabilised by marram grass. Other notable species include sea stock (Matthiola sinuate), sea stork's-bill (Erodium maritimum), sea clover (Trifolium aquamosum), Portland spurge (Euphorbia portlandica), sea spurge (Euphorbia paralias), and white horehound (Marrubium vulgare). Further inland, the stable grey dunes are stabilised by other species such as dune fescue (Vulpia membranacea). The dune slacks, the valleys between the dunes, may flood after heavy rain and are wet and marshy during the winter. They support round-headed club-rush (Scirpoides holoschoenus), sharp rush, round-leaved wintergreen (Pyrola rotundifolia ssp. maritima), early gentian (Gentianella anglica), and many orchid species. Listed as endangered on the Joint Nature Conservation Committee's Vascular Plant Red Data List for Great Britain, the water germander (Teucrium scordium), a perennial plant that lives in the slacks, has just one other population in the UK.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to verify, on whole plant level and during all the plant cycle, the hypothesis that nitrogen deficiency reduces root hydraulic conductivity through the water channels (aquaporins) activity, and that the plant reacts by changing root/shoot ratio. Root hydraulic conductivity, plant growth, root/shoot ratio and plant water status were assessed for durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), as influenced by nitrogen availability and HgCl 2 treatment. On both species during the plant cycle, nitrogen deficiency induced lower root hydraulic conductivity (- 49 and - 66 % respectively for barley and wheat) and <b>lower</b> <b>plant</b> growth. On wheat was also observed cycle delay, <b>lower</b> <b>plant</b> nitrogen content, but not lower leaf turgor pressure and epidermic cell dimension. The <b>lower</b> <b>plant</b> growth was due to <b>lower</b> <b>plant</b> dimension and <b>lower</b> tillering. Root /shoot ratio was always higher for nitrogen stressed plants, whether on dry matter or on surface basis. This was due to lower effect of nitrogen stress on root growth than on shoot growth. On wheat HgCl 2 treatment determined <b>lower</b> <b>plant</b> growth, and more than nitrogen stress, cycle delay and higher root/shoot ratio. The mercury, also, induced leaf rolling, lower turgor pressure, lower NAR, higher root cell wall lignification and lower epidermic cell number per surface unity. In nitrogen fertilized plants root hydraulic conductivity was always reduced by HgCl 2 treatment (- 61 and 38 %, respectively for wheat and barley), but in nitrogen unfertilized plants this effect was observed only during the first plant stages. This effect was higher during shooting and caryopsis formation, lower during tillering. It is concluded that barley and durum wheat react to nitrogen deficiency and HgCl 2 treatment by increasing the root/shoot ratio, to compensate water stress due to lower water root conductivity probably induced by lower aquaporin synthesis or inactivation. However, this compensation is not enough to keep a normal water status and this leads to <b>lower</b> <b>plant</b> growth. At the same time some doubts persist about mercury toxicity on other plant functions besides the aquaporin blockage...|$|R

6000|$|Agardh, {{and other}} of the botanists of Cuvier's generation, who {{occupied}} themselves with the <b>lower</b> <b>plants,</b> had observed that, under particular circumstances, {{the contents of the}} cells of certain water-weeds were set free, and moved about with considerable velocity, and with all the appearances of spontaneity, as locomotive bodies, which, from their similarity to animals of simple organisation, were called [...] "zoospores." [...] Even as late as 1845, however, a botanist of Schleiden's eminence dealt very sceptically with these statements; and his scepticism was the more justified, since Ehrenberg, in his elaborate and comprehensive work on the Infusoria, had declared the greater number of what are now recognised as locomotive plants to be animals.|$|E
60|$|Certainly {{there are}} odd things {{enough in the}} water. Among others, certain queer green things that are neither plants nor animals. Most {{of the time they}} are plants, quiet green threads matted together, but every now and then the inside comes out of one, so to speak, and starts off with a fine red eye and a long {{flickering}} tail, to see the world. The dabbler says it's quite a usual thing among the lower plants--Algæ he calls them, for some reason--to disgorge themselves in this way and go swimming about; but it has quite upset my notions of things. If the <b>lower</b> <b>plants,</b> why not the higher?

60|$|Among the <b>lower</b> <b>plants,</b> it is {{the rule}} rather than the exception, that {{contractility}} should be still more openly manifested at some periods of their existence. The protoplasm of Algae and Fungi becomes, under many circumstances, partially, or completely, freed from its woody case, and exhibits movements of its whole mass, or is propelled by the contractility of one, or more, hair-like prolongations of its body, which are called vibratile cilia. And, {{so far as the}} conditions of the manifestation of the phaenomena of contractility have yet been studied, they are the same for the plant as for the animal. Heat and electric shocks influence both, and in the same way, though it may be in different degrees. It is by no means my intention to suggest that there is no difference in faculty between the lowest plant and the highest, or between plants and animals. But the difference between the powers of the lowest plant, or animal, and those of the highest, is one of degree, not of kind, and depends, as Milne-Edwards [97] long ago so well pointed out, upon {{the extent to which the}} principle of the division of labour is carried out in the living economy. In the lowest organism all parts are competent to perform all functions, and one and the same portion of protoplasm may successfully take on the function of feeding, moving, or reproducing apparatus. In the highest, on the contrary, a great number of parts combine to perform each function, each part doing its allotted share of the work with great accuracy and efficiency, but being useless for any other purpose.|$|E

[...] In 1881, Robert decided to retire, with management of the <b>Lower</b> <b>Plant</b> entrusted to son Thomas, while Joseph and Alfred operated the Upper Plant. Both operations shared a common title, Robert Mann & Sons. The Upper Plant had a capacity of about 800 axes per day and employed 100 men; the <b>Lower</b> <b>Plant</b> made 400 axes per day and employed 65 men; [...] and the Flemington works employed about 30 men, making 300 axes per day.

Eventually, Alfred and William H. were given control of the Upper <b>Plant.</b> The <b>Lower</b> <b>Plant</b> was sold to Thomas with the youngest son, Robert Jr., as a partner. Joseph, however, withdrew for a time to try his hand at farming. [...] All axes were to carry the brand of Robert Mann, Mill Hall. A flood in June 1889 destroyed portions of both plants, existing inventory, coal and other supplies. Shortly thereafter, the family decided to sell-out to the Axe Trust. Alfred and Thomas were made plant superintendents, with Joseph appointed as general superintendent. These arrangements did not survive and in 1892, Joseph was discharged from American Axe and Tool Co.|$|R

The ordinations revealed differences in community structure {{from north to south}} and among individual sites; these geographical-scale patterns dominated species composition. Almost all taxa of epilithic algae and cyanobacteria were also present below the surface, but no completely endolithic lichens were present.
