25|$|Thatcher now faced, arguably, {{her most}} serious rival yet after the 1983 general election, when Michael Foot {{resigned}} as Leader of the Labour Party and was succeeded by Neil Kinnock.

25|$|Luton laboured {{once again}} in 1994–95, with the side {{struggling}} to score at home. Pleat's Luton side, including young players such as Oakes, Telfer and John Hartson, reacted positively when Pleat turned down the advances of Tottenham Hotspur to return to North London as General Manager, and rocketed up to fifth in the table, and for perhaps {{the first time in}} three seasons of Division One football, promotion was <b>looking</b> <b>a</b> real possibility. Hartson was bought by Arsenal for £2,500,000 soon after – a then-British record for a teenager. The season petered out into obscurity following Hartson's sale, and Luton finished 16th.|$|E

The tender– the only original (and historic) part of the replica engine– was sold to a scrap dealer and cut up, although the springs and axleboxes were salvaged for use in the replica LB Atlantic project at the Bluebell Railway, and part of one side was rescued by the Slough and Windsor Railway Society, where it is now on display.|$|E

25|$|Following {{a disappointing}} mid-week {{exit from the}} Coppa Italia, islanders Palermo visited the Tardini, having failed to score in each of their {{previous}} six away league games. Parma had the better {{of much of the}} first half with Giovinco <b>looking</b> <b>a</b> threat and going close on a couple of occasions, but Palermo came back strongly at the beginning of second half. However, as the second half wore on, Parma again looked the better of the two teams, but neither side were able to get the decisive goal and the match ended goalless. This was Parma's first draw of the season, having been the only side in the league without one and the first draw at the Tardini since February after twelve consecutive games without a draw at the Ducali's home ground.|$|E
500|$|In 1997 {{the club}} was {{purchased}} by former tennis player David Lloyd, who sacked Dolan as manager and replaced him with Mark Hateley after Hull could only finish in 17th place in the table. Hull's league form was steadily deteriorating {{to the point that}} relegation to the Football Conference was <b>looking</b> <b>a</b> real possibility. Lloyd sold the club in November 1998 to a South Yorkshire-based consortium, but retained ownership of Boothferry Park. Hateley departed in November 1998, with the club {{at the foot of the}} table. He was replaced by 34-year-old veteran player Warren Joyce, who steered the club to safety with games to spare. Hull City fans refer to this season as [...] "The Great Escape". Despite this feat, Joyce was replaced in April 2000 by the more experienced Brian Little.|$|E
500|$|Wisden {{describes}} {{how in the}} first innings, Agnew's accuracy was affected by debutant nerves, but an improved display in the second innings resulted in figures of 2–51. Agnew {{describes how}} Ian Botham helped him secure both wickets, catching Gordon Greenidge in the slips, and passing on some {{advice on how to}} dismiss Viv Richards, Botham's great friend: [...] "Botham said: 'Right. Don't pitch a single ball up at him. Have two men back for the hook, and bowl short every ball.' This I did for three overs or so, by which time Viv was <b>looking</b> <b>a</b> little exasperated, but was definitely on the back foot. Finally I pitched one up, the great man missed it and umpire David Constant ruled that Richards was LBW for 15." [...] Wisden called the pair of batsmen Agnew's [...] "first illustrious victims in Test cricket".|$|E

The Canadian Press reported that [...] "A number of celebrities' stars are <b>looking</b> <b>a</b> bit rough around the edges." [...] The president of the Walk of Fame stated that damage {{was due to the}} freezing and thawing during Canadian winters and also sidewalk snowplows. It was announced that the city of Toronto would replace Shatner and Howe's damaged tiles, and the Walk of Fame was looking into an alternative to installing the plaques on a sidewalk where they are subjected to harsh environmental conditions.|$|E

2500|$|The band {{decided to}} change its name to Revocation in 2006; Davidson commented: [...] "I think, <b>looking</b> <b>a</b> little deeper into it, we {{made a lot of}} {{mistakes}} with Cryptic Warning. We were younger and didn't really know what we were doing, so Revocation was us starting fresh with a clean slate and revoking our past mistakes." [...] With a direction change, Revocation promptly recorded a three-song demo titled Summon the Spawn, and in 2008 they went back into the studio to record their first full-length album, Empire of the Obscene. The full length was self-released, and the band financed its own tour, attracting the interest of several record labels. Revocation subsequently signed to Relapse Records.|$|E

[...] "They only think of the ethnic man in XXX jeans and Timberlands, and here Andre J. comes along with a pair of hot shorts and a caftan or maybe flip-flops or cowboy boots or a high, high heel." [...] Most recently, Andre J.'s style inspirations have included Cher and model Donyale Luna. They describe their aesthetic as a [...] "60s, not mod, but mod-ish, and hippie look" [...] that is also influenced by the style of 1970s blaxploitation films.|$|E
2500|$|Although he {{does not}} want to kill the {{elephant}} now that it seems peaceful, the narrator feels pressured by the demand of the crowd for the act to be carried out. After inquiring as to the elephant's behavior and delaying for some time, he shoots the elephant several times, wounding it but unable to kill it. The narrator then leaves the beast, unable to be in its presence as it continues to suffer. He later learns that it was stripped, nearly to the bone, within hours. His elderly colleagues agree that killing the elephant was the best thing to do, but the younger ones believe that it was worth more than the Indian it killed. The narrator then wonders if they will ever understand that he did it [...] "solely to avoid <b>looking</b> <b>a</b> fool." ...|$|E
