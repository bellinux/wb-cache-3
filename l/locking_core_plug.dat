The instrument used for grain volume determination was the TPI- 219 Helium Porosimeter, Coretest Systems, Inc, USA. The liquid permeabilities of the <b>core</b> <b>plugs</b> were measured with LiquidPerm, Vinci Technologies, France, using the brine (3800  ppm NaCl) as the pore fluid.

30|$|Five {{tests were}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of brine concentration on oil recovery from carbonate <b>core</b> <b>plugs</b> by spontaneous imbibition. As seen from Table  5, all tests were performed at an elevated temperature of 75  °C. Figure  8 shows the oil recovery (as fraction of IOIP) versus time for <b>core</b> <b>plugs</b> (1 – 3 and 5) using brines with different salinities. The first test was performed with distilled water as a base to observe the oil production from the carbonate <b>core</b> <b>plug</b> {{in the absence of}} any salinity. As expected, the oil production was meager when there was no salinity in the surrounding water. This observation was in good agreement with the findings of other researchers (Simjoo et al. 2015). In addition, experimental results of Tests 2 – 5 (40 -tdsw, 20 -tdsw, 10 -tdsw and 5 -tdsw) confirmed the effectiveness of ions in the imbibition water by producing a considerable amount of oil from <b>core</b> <b>plugs.</b>|$|R

30|$|Core {{analysis}} {{was done with}} 1.5 inch diameter cleaned and dried reservoir <b>core</b> <b>plugs.</b> The porosities and absolute permeabilities of the <b>core</b> <b>plugs</b> from depths of (2900 – 3100) meters were {{in the range of}} 17.62 – 18.62 % and 2 – 3 md, respectively, whereas for the shallower depth (2500 – 2700  m) <b>core</b> <b>plugs,</b> the respective values of porosities and absolute permeabilities were in the range of 24.64 – 25.15 % and 25 – 30 md respectively. An inverse correlation was observed between porosity–permeability and depth for the porous media under study. The most obvious reason for this inverse relationship was due to the combined effects of compaction and cementation (Nelson and Bird 2005).|$|R
30|$|Generally, all <b>core</b> <b>plugs</b> were water-wet after {{cleaning}} with toluene and methanol {{and then}} the surface had been changed to mild oil-wet during saturation with oil.

In this step, the core slab photograph analysis showed oil-wet behavior for selected samples.

Since most shales are very friable and fissured, {{it is often difficult to}} cut shale <b>core</b> <b>plug.</b> Its edges break off easily. Thus the cutting sample method can only be used for hard, competent rocks. The cutting position of samples can be explained by the following diagram.|$|R

50|$|Permeability is {{measured}} in the laboratory by encasing a <b>core</b> <b>plug</b> of known length and diameter in an air-tight sleeve (the Hassler Sleeve). A fluid of known viscosity is injected into the <b>core</b> <b>plug</b> while mounted in a steel chamber. The samples are either full diameter core samples that are intervals of whole core cut, typically 6 inches long, or 1-in plugs drilled from the cores. The pressure drop across the sample and the flow rate are measured and permeability is calculated using Darcy's law.|$|R
50|$|Sand cores {{are used}} to form the {{internal}} cavities when the engine block or cylinder head(s) is cast. These cavities are usually the coolant passages.

30|$|Spontaneous {{imbibition}} test acceptably simulates {{the production}} from fractured reservoirs in the tertiary oil recovery stage. In {{this type of}} experiment, the fluid in the fracture (brine around the core) penetrates into the <b>core</b> <b>plug</b> and drives the trapped oil out of the core. The fluid displacement in the Spontaneous imbibition phenomena is governed by both capillary and gravity forces. However, the small height of <b>core</b> <b>plug</b> and also the significance of capillary pressure {{in the case of}} tight rocks might lead to the capillary force as dominant mechanism, whereas the gravity force becomes negligible. Wettability alteration of pore surfaces towards water-wetness by imbibing fluid {{would be one of the}} main mechanisms that lead to the oil production from <b>core</b> <b>plug</b> during imbibition test. As above mentioned, the low-salinity water injection has been proposed to reach this purpose (Tang and Morrow 1997 a; Shehata and Nasr El-Din 2015).|$|R
30|$|The <b>core</b> <b>plug</b> {{used for}} {{coreflood}} foam stability tests was commercially available (Kocurek Industries INC., TX, USA).

Table  5 lists the physical properties of the <b>core</b> <b>plugs.</b> The high permeability and porosity cores were chosen because of their suitability for foam studies as they are better for foam generation (Mannhardt et al. 2000) and they minimize the capillary end effects which could significantly affect the coreflooding results.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that rocks {{containing}} water-reactive clays may swell when contacting with fresh water. In a conventional formation, this swelling may cause wellbore stability problem or damage formation by reducing its permeability. However, the effect of water salinity on shale rocks may be different. This issue is investigated in this paper. Shale rocks were immersed in water of different salinities. Shale rocks used were Mancos, Marcellus, Barnett and Eagle Ford. Different concentrations of NaCl and KCl salt solutions from 0 % to 30 % by weight were added in the water. It was observed that Mancos <b>core</b> <b>plugs</b> were crushed into loose grains (fragmented) at low salinity solutions up to 15 %. Barnett <b>core</b> <b>plugs</b> showed consecutive cracks along bedding planes at low salinities. Minor cracks were seen on Marcellus, while no visual cracks were found in Eagle Ford <b>core</b> <b>plugs</b> at low salinities. When the shale plugs were saturated with oil, 2 %- 15 % oil was recovered by water spontaneous imbibition, depending on water salinity and rock mineralogy. Similar observations were made when shale <b>core</b> <b>plugs</b> were applied to an overburden pressure. The results from this paper help us to understand the drive mechanisms in shale oil and shale gas reservoirs. It also stimulates us to explore new ways to improve oil and gas recovery in shale reservoirs...|$|R
40|$|This {{experimental}} work investigates Low Reservoir Quality Chalk (LRQC) reservoir properties using outcrop samples from six zones. The thesis {{is part of}} Joint Chalk Research Programme, Phase 7 (JCR 7), a large interdisciplinary consortium that focus on chalk research. The work have two main parts: Part A measures porosity, permeability and study flow, oil storage- and oil recovery potential for LRQC; Part B evaluates {{the use of a}} new method to measure relative permeability and capillary pressure using spontaneous imbibition with controlled boundary conditions. Porosity and permeability are two important properties that define the quality of a reservoir. Porosity was measured, with gas or brine, for 24 <b>core</b> <b>plugs</b> and ranges between φ= 14. 2 - 26. 0 %. Absolute permeability, measured with constant rate injection of brine, gas or oil, ranges between K= 0. 002 - 0. 820 mD. Permeability varied with injected fluid, and gas porosity and permeability were on average higher than measured with brine. Local heterogeneities within <b>core</b> <b>plugs</b> identified with CT imaging significantly influenced the measured reservoir properties. Oil recovery potential and multiphase flow properties were measured on 12 LRQC <b>core</b> <b>plugs.</b> The initial water saturation, established using constant differential pressure during oil injection in cores initially 100 % water saturated, varied between S_iw= 32. 9 - 38. 1 %. Oil recovery during forced or spontaneous imbibition was on average 36. 5 % OOIP. Relative permeability and capillary pressure for five LRQC <b>core</b> <b>plugs</b> were determined experimentally based on a methodology using spontaneous imbibition. A special boundary condition and theory proposed by (Haugen et al., 2014) was applied {{for the first time to}} LRQC <b>core</b> <b>plugs</b> to estimate relative permeability and capillary pressure.

The data generated demonstrate simple linear relationships between Vp and Vs. For dry <b>core</b> <b>plugs,</b> the Vp-Vs curve passes through zero and it indicates a nearly constant Compressional to Shear wave velocity ratio.

The relationships of Compressional and Shear wave velocities with porosity show that the velocities decrease with increase in porosity.
