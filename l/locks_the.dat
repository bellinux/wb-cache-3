2500|$|There are two {{mechanisms}} that Microsoft uses for locking: pessimistic locking, and optimistic locking. With pessimistic <b>locking,</b> <b>the</b> record or page is <b>locked</b> immediately when <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> is requested, while with optimistic <b>locking,</b> <b>the</b> <b>locking</b> is delayed until the edited record is saved. Conflicts {{are less likely}} to occur with optimistic <b>locking,</b> since <b>the</b> record is <b>locked</b> only {{for a short period of}} time. However, with optimistic locking one cannot be certain that the update will succeed because another user could <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> record first. With pessimistic <b>locking,</b> <b>the</b> update is guaranteed to succeed once <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> is obtained. Other users must wait until <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> is released in order to make their changes. [...] Lock conflicts, which either require the user to wait, or cause the request to fail (usually after a timeout) are more common with pessimistic locking.|$|R

5|$|Several old {{building}}s, which {{date from}} the 1880s, remain at Underfall Yard and have listed building status. The octagonal brick and terracotta chimney of the hydraulic engine house dates from 1888, and is grade II* listed, as is the hydraulic engine house itself. It is built of red brick with a slate roof and contains pumping machinery, installed in 1907 by Fullerton, Hodgart and Barclay of Paisley, which powers the dock's hydraulic system of cranes, bridges and <b>locks.</b> <b>The</b> former pattern-maker's shop and stores {{date from the}} same period and are grade II listed, as are the Patent slip and quay walls.|$|E

50|$|The {{construction}} {{of almost all}} <b>locks</b> on <b>the</b> Thames involved one or more artificial <b>lock</b> islands separating <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> from <b>the</b> weirs.

5|$|During {{the early}} and {{moderate}} stages, modifications to the living environment and lifestyle can increase patient safety and reduce caretaker burden. Examples of such modifications are the adherence to simplified routines, the placing of safety <b>locks,</b> <b>the</b> labelling of household items to cue {{the person with the}} disease or the use of modified daily life objects. If eating becomes problematic, food will need to be prepared in smaller pieces or even pureed. When swallowing difficulties arise, the use of feeding tubes may be required. In such cases, the medical efficacy and ethics of continuing feeding is an important consideration of the caregivers and family members. The use of physical restraints is rarely indicated in any stage of the disease, although there are situations when they are necessary to prevent harm to the person with AD or their caregivers.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, the British Transport Commission, {{together}} with the British Iron and Steel Federation and Sheffield Chamber of Commerce considered plans to upgrade the navigation to handle 250-tonne barges, and work started on new wharfs and warehouses at Rotherham. Control of the navigation passed on again in 1963, this time to the British Waterways Board, who submitted a proposal to the government for a £2.5million upgrade, covering the stretch from Bramwith to Rotherham. This would have involved the construction of ten new locks, each , to replace the existing 12 <b>locks.</b> <b>The</b> new main line would then {{have been the same}} size as the Aire and Calder Navigation, although some of the bridges would have had less clearance. In 1972, a further proposal for a £2million scheme to upgrade the waterway to handle 700-tonne barges up to Mexborough, and 400-tonne barges from there to Rotherham was submitted to the Department of the Environment.|$|E
50|$|In {{common with}} many of <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> on {{this section of the}} canal, the remains of <b>the</b> {{original}} <b>locks</b> can still be seen beside the newer ones. <b>The</b> four <b>locks</b> raise <b>the</b> level of the canal by 26.75 ft. Below <b>the</b> bottom <b>lock,</b> <b>the</b> canal is level for 0.4 mi to Welsh Road <b>Lock,</b> and above <b>the</b> top <b>lock,</b> it is level for 1.6 mi to Itchington Bottom <b>Lock.</b> <b>The</b> paddles on <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> reflect <b>the</b> style of the Warwick and Napton Canal, and are different from those further south, where the canal was built by the Grand Junction company.|$|R
50|$|County <b>Lock</b> has <b>the</b> lowest rise of <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> on <b>the</b> Kennet, as boats only rise or fall about 30 cm (1 foot) in <b>the</b> <b>lock.</b> <b>The</b> {{main stream}} of the Kennet flows down the weir {{on the far}} side of <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> while another arm of the Kennet disappears under the Bridge Street Roundabout.|$|R

5|$|The castle is {{opposite}} Wharton's Lock, {{which is}} followed by the village of Tiverton on the north bank. Immediately after a bridge carrying the A49 road over the canal is the first of the two Beeston <b>locks.</b> <b>The</b> first is called Beeston Iron Lock, and was built from cast iron plates in 1828 by Telford. Cast iron was used because of problems with running sand under the original stone locks. It is both a grade II* listed structure and a scheduled ancient monument, and is unique in England. Shortly afterwards is Beeston Stone Lock, also a listed structure, but dating from the construction of the canal and using conventional materials.|$|E
5|$|The newer {{technologies}} of road and rail {{led to the}} navigation falling into disuse. Some lengths of the system were drained or allowed to overgrow with vegetation. Increasingly {{the difference between the}} canal and the river became less obvious, although it is still possible to identify remains of the original <b>locks.</b> <b>The</b> threat to the remains which the construction of the M3 motorway posed spurred the Winchester Tenants and Residents Association and the local branch of the Inland Waterways Association into action in 1975, with both suggesting that the waterway could be restored. The two groups later co-operated, and the Itchen Navigation Preservation Society was formed.|$|E

Todd arrives and saves Batman, who subdues Scarecrow with his own fear toxin.|$|E
5000|$|O-locks {{provide a}} limited degree of security, like all <b>locks.</b> [...] <b>The</b> {{greatest}} security requires using multiple types of locks together. In Copenhagen and Japan, the O-lock is generally used alone; the bikes are insured against theft {{and the owner}} must show {{that they have the}} key, to demonstrate that <b>the</b> bike was <b>locked.</b> <b>The</b> key can only be removed by <b>locking</b> <b>the</b> <b>lock.</b> In other locations, the O-lock is used along with <b>locking</b> <b>the</b> frame to a secure object, or the O-lock is used alone when the owner is very close by, to prevent ride-off theft.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lock</b> <b>the</b> Gate Alliance {{allegedly}} has {{an operational}} budget of $2,184,165 in 2016. It {{is funded by}} grants, donations and receives in-kind support. Notable donors include Kjerulf Ainsworth, during the two years prior to October 2012 contributed approximately $200,000 towards fund legal, travel and other expenses for Drew Hutton, to screen the documentary film Gasland in over 80 country towns and to fund activist Dayne Pratzky. Another Notable donor is the American-based political body “Tides foundation” who declared funding of $160,000 in 2013 and $275,000 in 2012 to <b>Lock</b> <b>the</b> Gate. According to forms lodged to the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC), {{a large proportion of}} <b>Lock</b> <b>the</b> Gate’s funding has come from undisclosed sources. For instance, in 2015 <b>Lock</b> <b>the</b> Gate received $823,000 from an undisclosed source. In 2016 <b>Lock</b> <b>the</b> Gate received $2.1 million from undisclosed grants and donations. Membership subscriptions accounts for 0.2% of their income.|$|R
2500|$|In 1954, {{operation}} of <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> ceased permanently {{when the government}} received word from logging operators that they {{would no longer be}} using <b>the</b> <b>lock.</b> [...] All commercial boat service through <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> had stopped many years before. [...] After <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> was shut down, a large log drifting down the river floated over the top of <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> striking <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> machinery, effectively putting <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> permanently out of operation.|$|R
5|$|Two {{years passed}} {{before the next}} attempt on the Ostend <b>locks.</b> <b>The</b> First Ostend Raid was {{conducted}} {{in tandem with the}} similar Zeebrugge Raid led by Acting Vice-Admiral Roger Keyes on 23 April 1918; a large scale operation to block the wider canal at Zeebrugge. Both attacks largely failed, but while at Zeebrugge the operation came so close to success that it took several months for the British authorities to realise that it had been unsuccessful, at Ostend the attack had ended catastrophically. Both blockships intended to close off the canal had grounded over half a mile from their intended location and been scuttled by their crews under heavy artillery and long-range small arms fire, which caused severe casualties. Thus while Zeebrugge seemed to be blocked entirely, Ostend was open wide, nullifying any success that might have been achieved at the other port.|$|E
5|$|Environmental hazards {{induced by}} humans also puts {{sirenians}} at risk. Sirenians, especially the West Indian manatee, face high mortality from watercraft collision, {{and about half}} of all West Indian manatee deaths are caused by watercraft collisions. An increased usage of hydroelectric power and subsequent damming of rivers increase waterway traffic, which can lead to vessel collisions, and manatees may become entangled in navigational <b>locks.</b> <b>The</b> urbanized coastline of areas such as the Caribbean and Australia can result in the decline of seagrass populations. Reliable areas of warm water in Florida are generally the result of discharge from power plants, but newer plants with more efficient cooling systems may disrupt the pattern of warm water refuges, and an increased demand for artesian springs for water, the natural source of warm water, decreases the number of warm water refuges. Sirenians can be caught as bycatch from fisheries, and they can be seen as pests with the interference of local fishermen and the destruction of their nets. African manatees have also been known to venture into rice paddies and destroy the crops during the rainy season, and these confrontations with locals may lead to intentional culling of the manatees.|$|E
5|$|Mulder goes {{to visit}} Madame Zirinka again, who {{tells him that}} the planets come into {{alignment}} like this only once every 84 years, and additional alignments will cause anyone born on January 12, 1979 (Margi and Terri's birthdate) {{to have all the}} energy in the cosmos focused on them. Margi goes to see Scott alone but an angry Terri arrives. The two argue with each other and end up accidentally killing Scott. Margi goes to Mulder, telling him that Terri is responsible for the murders, while Terri goes to see Scully and tells her the opposite. The agents call each other and bring both girls to the police station, where the place starts shaking and all the guns go off on their own. Mulder <b>locks</b> <b>the</b> girls in a room together and their power goes away once the clock ticks midnight. When the town mob and Detective White finally see Terri and Margi as the culprits, Spitz claims it was the work of Satan, oblivious to the cosmic alignment's energy. Mulder and Scully drive home, arguing again over directions; when Scully defiantly runs a stop sign, Mulder notifies her but she tells him to shut up, which he does.|$|E

5|$|There are a {{total of}} 105 locks on the Kennet and Avon Canal from Bristol to the River Thames, {{including}} 6 on the navigable section of the River Avon from Bristol to Bath and 9 on the navigable section of the River Kennet to its confluence with the Thames near Reading. The remaining 90 locks lie along the 57miles (92km) of canal. In Bath the canal separates from the river but follows its valley as far as Bradford on Avon. The ornate Bath Locks lead to a stretch through Limpley Stoke valley with few <b>locks.</b> <b>The</b> flight of locks at Devizes, including the Caen Hill Locks, raises the canal to its longest pound, which then ascends the 4 Wooton Rivers locks to the short summit pound which includes the Bruce Tunnel. Pumping stations are used to supply the canal with water. The canal continues through the rural landscape of Wiltshire and Berkshire before joining the River Kennet at Newbury and becoming a navigable river to Reading, where it flows into the River Thames.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} at the tavern, Morrison meets Brown's wife (Agi Szirtes), and tells her that Brown is under {{suspicion}} for the theft and for the murder at the quayside. He asks for her help in finding him and repeats to her Mitchell's offer to Brown, but she remains silent. At home, Henriette tells Maloin she found a man in their hut at the seaside, and in fear locked the door and ran home. An agitated Maloin tells her not to tell anyone, and leaves for the hut. He unlocks the door, and receiving no response to his calling Brown's name, steps inside, closing the door behind. Minutes later he re-emerges, breathing heavily. After pausing to compose himself, he <b>locks</b> <b>the</b> door and leaves. In the next scene, Maloin presents the briefcase to Morrison in the tavern, and asks him to arrest him, confessing to having killed Brown an hour ago. Morrison leaves with Maloin for the hut, dismissing the frenzied inquiries of Brown's wife about her husband and handing the briefcase to the barkeep on the way out. Brown's wife follows the men to the hut, and emerges weeping with Morrison moments later. Back at the tavern, Morrison prepares two envelopes with {{a small portion of}} the recovered money in each. One he leaves with the grieving widow to whom he apologizes and wishes well, while the other he gives to Maloin, telling him that his case was one of self-defense. As he is preparing to leave, Morrison advises Maloin to go home and forget the whole affair. The camera focuses on the expressionless face of Brown's wife momentarily before fading to white.|$|E
5|$|With {{all of the}} {{evidence}} of the Bay Harbor Butcher murders pointing to Doakes as the killer, the case is closed. Forensic investigator Vince Masuka (C. S. Lee) tells Dexter the gas in the cabin was turned on while the stove was lit, and when Dexter sees his own satellite navigation system while cataloging evidence, he realizes that Lila must have found the cabin. He meets with her at the aquarium and tells her that he, like her, has no emotion and lives a life devoid of feeling. They form plans to leave Miami together, though Dexter secretly intends to kill her. When he visits her apartment the next day, though, he finds Debra there, trying to persuade Lila to leave town. Dexter is forced to lie about running away with Lila in front of Debra, so a hurt Lila then leaves with what she recognizes as Dexter's bag of murder equipment. She goes to Rita's house and drugs the babysitter so that she can abduct the children, Astor and Cody (Christina Robinson and Preston Bailey). When Dexter realizes that Astor and Cody are missing, he goes straight to Lila's apartment, where she lights another fire and <b>locks</b> <b>the</b> three of them inside. Rita calls Debra for her help, and Debra decides to skip her flight to Oregon with Lundy to help with finding the children. Dexter manages to free Astor and Cody through a small window and eventually rams down a thin wall allowing him to escape.|$|E
