30|$|The {{present study}} {{revealed}} {{a positive correlation}} of SOCS with altitude. The anthropogenic disturbances are higher at the lower altitudes (for example, logging and wood collection in the ericaceous forest) and lower at the higher altitude (afroalpine grasslands). There is also temperature (higher <b>in</b> the ericaceous <b>belt</b> and <b>lower</b> <b>in</b> the afroalpine grassland) and precipitation (<b>lower</b> <b>in</b> the ericaceous <b>belt</b> and higher <b>in</b> the afroalpine grassland) variation along the altitude altitudinal gradient. These could {{be some of the}} many reasons for the increasing trend of SOCS along an altitude altitudinal gradient. Several studies reported a positive correlation of SOCS with altitude (Dar and Somaiah 2015; Du et al. 2014; He et al. 2016; Parras-Alcántara et al. 2015). Furthermore, a research in the dry evergreen Afromontane forest of Ethiopia by Feyissa et al. (2013) also showed an increasing trend of SOC stock along altitude gradient. This could be due to the decreased decomposition in relation to the production and long-term accumulation of organic carbon (Bolstad and Vose 2001). However, a study from Himalaya reported the decrease of SOC with increasing altitude (Sheikh et al. 2009). Consequently, Tsui et al. (2013) claimed that altitude is possibly a simple and effective predictor of SOC stock.|$|R
40|$|IntroductionStroke {{mortality}} rates differ {{by race and}} region, and smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke are associated with stroke. We evaluated regional and racial differences in current smoking and secondhand smoke exposure among participants in the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study. MethodsAfrican American and white adults (n = 26, 373) aged 45 years or older were recruited during 2003 through 2007. Logistic regression {{was used to examine}} the likelihood of current smoking and secondhand smoke exposure by race (African American vs white) and region. We compared the buckle of the stroke belt (the coastal plain region of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia) with the stroke belt (the remainder of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, plus Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Louisiana) and compared each of these regions with the remaining contiguous states. ResultsAmong whites, no regional differences in current smoking were seen, but among African Americans, the odds of current smoking were 5 % <b>lower</b> <b>in</b> the stroke <b>belt,</b> and 24 % <b>lower</b> <b>in</b> the stroke buckle than those in the nonbelt region. Similarly, among whites no regional differences in exposure to secondhand smoke were found, whereas among African Americans, the odds of being exposed to secondhand smoke were 14 % <b>lower</b> <b>in</b> the stroke buckle than for nonbelt residents. ConclusionsThese data suggest that rates of current smoking and secondhand smoke exposure are not higher in regions that have higher stroke mortality and therefore cannot contribute to geographic disparities; nevertheless, given that 15 % of our participants reported current smoking and 16 % reported secondhand smoke exposure, continued implementation of tobacco control policies is needed...|$|R

According to maximal quantum yield, the different response between species in microsite light categories was evidenced for silver fir on microsites with predominating diffuse light and for beech on microsites with predominating direct light, respectively. Abundance and change of share in microsite light categories was compared over different elevation belts on comparable sites between two silvicultural systems. The share of forest edge area was bigger in the irregular shelterwood system. Change in width of forest edge (20, 30 and 40 m) {{did not affect}} the proportion and share of the microsite in both regions of different silvicultural system. Separation of microsite areas between both silvicultural systems, evident <b>in</b> <b>lower</b> elevation <b>belts</b> was not evident in the most conflict and highest elevation zone, while the absolute values of all categories above 700 m in both systems were almost identical, indicating the same, small-scale irregular shelterwood system, known also as the freestyle silvicultural approach...|$|R

30|$|The {{impact of}} climate change on the {{structure}} and function of forest ecosystems has been observed in many places, and this knowledge is continuously expanding to cover biodiversity, distribution, growth, productivity and mortality (Allen et al. 2010; Lei et al. 2016; Kim et al. 2017). Forests have globally and regionally suffered from drought and heat events (Kozyr 2014; Anenkhonov et al. 2015). These include pine and oak species in Mediterranean regions (Ruiz et al., 2013), larch forests and pine forests of the <b>lower</b> forest <b>belt</b> <b>in</b> Southern Transbaikalia, Russia (Kozyr 2014), and coniferous forests in South Korea (Kim et al. 2017). The common causal factors in these examples are elevated temperatures and/or water stress, raising {{the possibility that the}} world’s forests are increasingly responding to ongoing warming and drying. There is limited opportunity for tree species to adapt to changing climatic conditions due to the combination of rapid climate change and the long life-span of trees (Eilmann et al. 2013). Climate-induced forest mortality seems to be an emerging global phenomenon, and investigation into the physiological mechanisms through which dry and hot climatic conditions drive tree death and forest die-off represent a rapidly growing research area (Allen et al. 2010; Levesque et al. 2013; Anenkhonov et al. 2015). Understanding the impact of future climate change on forest species is important for forest managers to generate adaptation and mitigation strategies.|$|R
