[...] As the Native American population declined, more land was available for European settlement. All these factors made the Native American populations decline dramatically.|$|E

60|$|I {{am quite}} ready {{to admit that the}} fact that you make a {{particular}} branch of trade more profitable, induces more people to engage in that branch of trade. That is what I call stimulating Colonial production through the agency of price. I am quite prepared to admit that a very small tax on staple articles would affect prices in a very small manner. Reference has been made to the imposition of a shilling duty on corn, and I think it was Mr. Moor[3] who said, yesterday, that when the shilling duty was imposed prices fell, and when it was taken off prices rose. That may be quite true. I do not know that it is true, but it may be. The imposition of such a small duty as a shilling on a commodity produced in such vast abundance as wheat, might quite easily be swamped or concealed by the operation of other more powerful factors. A week of unusual sunshine, or a night of <b>late</b> <b>frost,</b> or a ring in the freights, or violent speculation, might easily swamp and cover the operation of such a small duty; but it is the opinion of those whose economic views I share--I cannot put it higher than that--that whatever circumstances may apparently conceal the effect of the duty on prices, the effect is there all the same, and that any duty that is imposed upon a commodity becomes a factor in the price of that commodity. I should have thought that was an almost incontestable proposition.|$|E

50|$|Annual. Plant is erect with {{pubescent}} stems {{coming from}} the taproots. The leaves are alternate with two lateral veins beginning from the base, prominent and parallel to the midrib, crenate to crenate-serrate, or petiolate. The spikes are axillary or terminal, or both. The bracts are leaf-like. There are no petals. The flowers are pistillate with 3-5 sepals and a 3-locular ovary. The staminate flowers with 4 sepals and 8-16 stamens. The capsules are broader than they are long. The plant grows up to 0.8m high. The stems are freely branched and densely pubescent with short incurved (or appressed) ascending trichomes. The leaves are elliptic to elliptic-lanceolate which are 2-6 cm long and 0.5-2 cm wide, obtuse, crenate. The base of the leaves are cuneate to rounded, with pubescence of both surfaces (more or less glabrate). The petioles of principle leaves are 0.4-1.5 cm long. The axillary spike has 1-5 pistillate flowers near the base that are interrupted and continued with a spike of staminate flowers. The pistillate bracts are often stipitate-glandular, teeth triangular, 5-13. The seeds are reddish to black in color and are ovoid, 1.2-1.8mm long.

50|$|Following {{the above}} guidelines, {{here is a}} {{practical}} example: A good apricot for Phoenix Arizona (350 chilling hours) would be Katy apricot with a 200-300 chilling hours requirement. It is early blooming and ripens in May and the tree itself thrives in the intense dry desert heat with adequate regular irrigation. The Katy apricot has no apparent pests or disease problems locally. Planting a Katy apricot only 100 mi north (1000+ chill hours) would likely be fruitless from <b>late</b> <b>frost</b> damage to the flowers. A late ripening apricot variety like Autumn Glo might be a bad choice for Phoenix because the intense long summer heat (115+) might cook the green fruit on the tree and result in strange tastes and other problems with late ripening. The same late ripening variety might also fail in the colder areas 100 mi north because of the shorter summer not allowing enough time to properly ripen before cold weather sets in. A better apricot choice for that colder area might be Goldcot with an 800 chill hour requirement. The late ripening Autumn Glo {{might be better off}} in a long cool summer climate along the west coast.|$|E

5000|$|For {{trees to}} be useful in archaeological analysis, they must [...] "produce annual growth rings that are uniform around the tree stem", they must [...] "live for decades and, preferably, centuries" [...] and they [...] "must have been used {{extensively}} by humans either for habitation or fuel." [...] One {{of the problems with}} this evaluation is that it is possible under certain conditions for a tree to miss a growth-ring or produce two growth rings in a season. During extreme drought there can be insufficient growth of xylem to form a noticeable ring. Alternatively, if a defoliating agent (e.g. drought, <b>late</b> <b>frost,</b> or insect damage) can arrest the growth of a tree early in a year, after which there is a secondary growth period of new foliage causing two rings to form. Another difficulty in the use of tree-ring dating as applied to archaeology is the variety and condition of wood used in construction of archaeological sites. Many such samples are encountered wet. Heartwood can normally retain much of its substance and can be dried out and polished for analysis. On the other hand, ancient wet sapwood samples seldom survive drying out. As a result the sapwood should either be measured wet and then allowed to dry, or it should be frozen or kept wet.|$|E
