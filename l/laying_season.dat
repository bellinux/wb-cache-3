500|$|Water was scarce, and an {{important}} task for Nicolls was {{to ensure that the}} island had a stable source of water. He achieved this by installing systems of pipes and carts to bring water to the settlement from the few springs in the mountains. Food was mostly shipped from England, but some could be procured locally: fish, a few vegetables grown on the island, feral goats and sheep, fishy-tasting eggs from a tern colony on the island, and turtle meat obtained during the <b>laying</b> <b>season</b> from December to May. Due to Nicolls's efforts in directing the harvest of turtles, turtle meat, an expensive delicacy in England, became so common it was fed to prisoners and pigs, and Marines complained of it. This surfeit of turtle irritated Nicolls's superiors and the Lords of the Admiralty, and when an admiral ordered Nicolls to stop feeding turtle to prisoners, he started selling or bartering it to visiting ships. With this monotonous diet, men on the island relied on rum for spice. Nicolls understood this, and gave large rations of grog when his men showed what he called [...] "spirited and Soldierlike feelings".|$|E

Upon the weather depends the commencement of this season of unwonted activity among the turtles and wild excitement among the river-side Indians, for the snows must cease to fall on the summits of the Andes, and the rivers must decrease in volume so as to lay bare vast spaces of sand, before the eggs can be laid.|$|E
40|$|Aldabra Atoll, {{a strict}} Nature Reserve and major {{breeding}} station of lesser and greater frigatebirds, may {{be developed for}} tourism. Determining whether this affects the frigate breeding populations is complicated by their extended annual <b>laying</b> <b>seasons</b> and the biennial breeding periodicity of individuals rearing fledgelings. This study, using a census method incorporating adjustments for seasonal changes in nest numbers, changes in nest ownership and replacement laying, indicates that {{there are at least}} 4000 pairs of greater frigatebirds and 6000 pairs of lesser frigatebirds annually involved in breeding activities. There is some evidence that more male than female greater frigatebirds attempt to pair each season. Comparison with an earlier census suggests that severe human disturbance induces curtailment of <b>laying</b> <b>seasons,</b> major changes in nest distribution and prevents many birds from breeding...|$|R

40|$|Large annual £uctuations {{are seen}} in {{breeding}} numbers in many populations of non-annual breeders. We examined the interannual variation in nesting numbers of populations of green (Chelonia mydas) (n ˆ 16 populations), loggerhead (Caretta caretta) (n ˆ 10 populations), leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) (n ˆ 9 populations) and hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) (n ˆ 10 populations). Interannual variation was greatest in the green turtle. When comparing green and loggerhead turtles nesting in Cyprus we found that green turtles {{were more likely to}} change the interval between <b>laying</b> <b>seasons</b> and showed greater variation in the number of clutches laid in a season. We suggest that these di¡erences are driven by the varying trophic statuses of the di¡erent species. Green turtles are herbivorous, feeding on sea grasses and macro-algae, and this primary production will be more tightly coupled with prevailing environmental conditions than the carnivorous diet of the loggerhead turtle...|$|R
60|$|I {{remember}} that one day, when I was thirteen, I went out one morning after breakfast to look for plovers' eggs, just {{at the beginning of}} the <b>laying</b> <b>season</b> when all the eggs one found were practically new- laid. My plan was that of the native boys, to go at a fast gallop over the plain and mark the spot far ahead where a lapwing was seen to rise and fly straight away to some distance. For this method some training is necessary to success, as in many cases more birds than one-- sometimes as many as three or four--would be seen to rise at various points and distances, and one had to mark and keep in memory the exact spots to visit them successively and find the nests. The English method of going out and quartering the ground in search of a nest in likely places where the birds breed was too slow for us.|$|E
60|$|Two {{miles from}} my home there stood an old mud-built house, {{thatched}} with rushes, and shaded by a few ancient half-dead trees. Here lived a very old woman with her two unmarried daughters, both withered and grey as their mother; indeed, in appearance, they were three amiable sister witches, all very very old. The high ground on which the house stood sloped down to an extensive reed- and rush-grown marsh, the source of an important stream; it was a paradise of wild fowl, swan, roseate spoonbill, herons white and herons grey, ducks {{of half a dozen}} species, snipe and painted snipe, and stilt, plover and godwit; the glossy ibis, and the great crested blue ibis with a powerful voice. All these interested, I might say fascinated, me less than the tame geese that spent most of their time in or on the borders of the marsh in the company of the wild birds. The three old women were so fond of their geese that they would not part with one for love or money; the most they would ever do would be to present an egg, in the <b>laying</b> <b>season,</b> to some visitor as a special mark of esteem.|$|E

5000|$|In the United States, {{laying hens}} are butchered after their second egg <b>laying</b> <b>season.</b> In Europe, they are {{generally}} butchered after a single season.

50|$|Point Denis {{is a major}} {{breeding}} ground for the leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea). Between 1 800 and 2 000 nests are laid annually on its beaches. Recent studies by Dr Sharon Deem, formerly of the Wildlife Conservation Society, note that the worldwide turtle population is being threatened by man's activities. One such activity {{is the development of}} Point Denis. Turtles find their way to the sea by using the light from the moon shimmering off the water as a reference. Man-made artificial lights at night disorientate the female turtles during <b>laying</b> <b>season</b> as well as the hatchlings trying to find their way to the water. As a result, many turtles head off in the wrong direction and can die from starvation and dehydration. Nests are also destroyed by visitors who drive vehicles, mainly quad bikes, on the beaches. Another problem is the pollution from the nearby town of Libreville. Turtles often mistake plastic bags in the water for jellyfish, their principal food source, and die if they ingest them. Nevertheless, there is a growing environmental movement in Gabon, protection of the turtles being one of their priorities.|$|E

50|$|The equine botfly {{presents}} seasonal difficulties to equestrian caretakers, as it lays eggs on {{the insides}} of horses' front legs, on the cannon bone and knees, and sometimes on the throat or nose, depending on the species. These eggs, which look like small, yellow drops of paint, must be carefully removed during the <b>laying</b> <b>season</b> (late summer and early fall) to prevent infestation in the horse. When a horse rubs its nose on its legs, the eggs are transferred to the mouth, {{and from there to}} the intestines, where the larvae grow and attach themselves to the stomach lining or the small intestine. The attachment of the larvae to the tissue produces a mild irritation which results in erosions and ulcerations at this site. Removal of the eggs (which adhere to the host's hair) is difficult, since the bone and tendons are directly under the skin on the cannon bones: eggs must be removed with a sharp knife (often a razor blade) or rough sand paper, and caught before they reach the ground. The larvae remain attached and develop for 10-12 months before they are passed out in the feces. Occasionally, horse owners report seeing the botfly larvae in horse manure. These larvae are cylindrical in shape and are reddish orange in color. In one to two months, adult botflies emerge from the developing larvae and the cycle repeats. Bots can be controlled with several types of dewormers, including dichlorvos, ivermectin, and trichlorfon.|$|E
