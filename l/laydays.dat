50|$|Laytime and <b>laydays</b> {{are often}} {{confused}} as {{referring to the}} same idea. <b>Laydays</b> refers {{to the time when}} a ship must present itself to the charterer. If the ship arrives before the <b>laydays</b> specified, the charterer does not have to take control or start loading (depending on the type of charter). If the ship arrives after the <b>laydays,</b> then the contract can be cancelled - hence <b>laydays</b> are often presented as the term <b>Laydays</b> and Cancelling and can be shortened to Laycan.|$|E
5000|$|A ready {{berth clause}} is {{inserted}} in a charter-party, i.e. a stipulation {{to the effect that}} <b>laydays</b> will begin to count as soon as the vessel has arrived at the port of loading or discharge [...] "whether in berth or not". It protects shipowner's interests against delays which arise from ships having to wait for a berth.|$|E
