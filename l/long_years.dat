5|$|In Paris, Maria and Eugene Jolas nursed Joyce {{during his}} <b>long</b> <b>years</b> of writing Finnegans Wake. Were {{it not for}} their support (along with Harriet Shaw Weaver's {{constant}} financial support), {{there is a good}} possibility that his books might never have been finished or published. In their literary magazine transition, the Jolases published serially various sections of Finnegans Wake under the title Work in Progress. Joyce returned to Zurich in late 1940, fleeing the Nazi occupation of France.|$|E
5|$|The Wood Badge {{course was}} pilot-tested still further in 1971 at Philmont, the five test councils, {{and in every}} {{national}} region excepting Region 8. In 1972, after five <b>long</b> <b>years</b> of testing and experimentation, the official new Wood Badge Staff Guide was published. The program was mandated for nationwide implementation and included {{for the first time}} teaching leadership skills over Scoutcraft skills.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 {{the tournament}} severed its {{relationship}} with Toyota. Grupo Santander, {{one of the largest}} banks in the world, became the sponsor of the Copa Libertadores, and thus the official name changed to Copa Santander Libertadores. In that season, LDU Quito became the first team from Ecuador to win the Copa Libertadores after defeating Fluminense 3–1 on penalties. Goalkeeper Jose Francisco Cevallos played a key role, saving three penalties in the final shootout in what {{is considered one of the}} best ever final series in the competition's history. It was also the highest-scoring final in the history of the tournament. The biggest resurgence of the decade happened in the 50th edition of the Copa Libertadores and it was won by a former power that has reinvented itself. Estudiantes de La Plata, led by Juan Sebastián Verón, won their fourth title 39 <b>long</b> <b>years</b> after the successful generation of the 1960s (led by Juan Sebastián's father, Juan Ramón). The pincharatas managed to emulate their predecessors by defeating Cruzeiro 2–1 on the return leg in Belo Horizonte.|$|E

5|$|In the 1985 NBA Finals, the Lakers made amends {{for their}} {{previous}} eight losses to the Celtics by defeating them in six games. Even though the Lakers lost {{the first game}} by 34 points in the Memorial Day Massacre, they won 4 of the next 5 games, including Game 6 at the Boston Garden, to finally end the <b>long</b> <b>years</b> of frustration of failing to defeat the Celtics. These finals {{were the first to}} be played in the 2–3–2 format, which was suggested by Boston coach Red Auerbach to NBA commissioner David Stern, as he hoped to cut back on the frequent traveling from Boston to Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Israel competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016. It was the nation's sixteenth {{appearance}} at the Summer Olympics. The Olympic Committee of Israel confirmed a team of 47 athletes, 22 men and 25 women, to compete across 17 sports at the Games. It was the nation's largest ever delegation sent to the Olympics, breaking its previous record of 43 athletes set in 2008. Among the sports represented by its athletes, Israel marked its Olympic debut in golf (new to the 2016 Games), mountain biking, and triathlon, {{as well as its}} return to road cycling, taekwondo, weightlifting, and wrestling after <b>long</b> <b>years</b> of absence. The nation's full roster also reached a historic milestone for Israeli women, as they officially outnumbered the men for the first time.|$|E
5|$|The {{designs for}} Fort Tigné were {{eventually}} made in 1792, possibly {{due to the}} threat of a French invasion. It was commissioned by Grand Master Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc, and was designed by the newly appointed engineer of the Order, Antoine Étienne de Tousard. Construction began in 1793 under the supervision of capomastro Antonio Cachia, and was completed in July 1795. The fort was named after the knight François René Jacob de Tigné, the nephew of the military engineer René Jacob de Tigné, in recognition of his <b>long</b> <b>years</b> of service with the Order. Tigné also paid 1000 scudi for the construction of the new fort, while de Rohan paid about 6000 scudi. Another 500 scudi were donated by the Bali de Tillet, {{while the rest of the}} funds were paid by the Fondazione Manoel.|$|E

5|$|With {{the rapidly}} deteriorating {{military}} {{situation for the}} German Army on the Eastern Front, it became increasingly important to interrupt the flow of supplies from the Western Allies to the Soviet Union. By December 1943, the German Army was forced into continuous retreat. The Luftwaffe had been seriously weakened by four <b>long</b> <b>years</b> of war, and increasing Allied anti-submarine capabilities were steadily degrading {{the effectiveness of the}} U-boats. The only effective weapon at the disposal of the Germans in Norway was Scharnhorst—Tirpitz was badly damaged, and the four remaining heavy cruisers were committed to the Baltic. During a conference with Hitler on 19–20 December, Großadmiral Karl Dönitz decided to employ Scharnhorst against the next Allied convoy that presented itself. Erich Bey, by now promoted to Konteradmiral, was given command of the task force.|$|E
