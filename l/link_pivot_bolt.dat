25|$|Instead {{of a pair}} of {{horizontal}} bolts that allow the caliper to move straight in and out respective to the car body, a swinging caliper utilizes a single, vertical <b>pivot</b> <b>bolt</b> located somewhere behind the axle centerline. When the driver presses the brakes, the brake piston pushes on the inside piston and rotates the whole caliper inward, when viewed from the top. Because the swinging caliper's piston angle changes relative to the disc, this design uses wedge-shaped pads that are narrower in the rear on the outside and narrower on the front on the inside.|$|R
5000|$|The visor swung up {{to uncover}} the wearer's face {{when he was not}} in combat, to grant him better {{visibility}} and unrestricted ventilation. This was accomplished in one of two ways. The most common form of visor in Central Europe was held on by a single hinge fastened {{to the center of the}} top of the visor, called a Klappviser. The other version had two <b>pivot</b> <b>bolts</b> on either side of the visor attaching it to the bascinet at the temples, and this was the most common form found in Southern, Western and Northwestern Europe.|$|R

5000|$|... "Horst Link" [...] {{suspension}} {{is a type}} of four-bar linkage suspension. It {{is characterized}} by having both connecting <b>links</b> <b>pivot</b> on the seat tube, with the lower pivot located above the center of the bottom bracket, and the rear axle being located higher than the <b>pivot</b> connecting floating <b>link</b> and lower connecting link.|$|R
50|$|The top {{and lower}} <b>link</b> <b>pivots</b> use roller bearings, {{reducing}} friction relative to plain bearings and improving both the smoothness {{and speed of}} suspension response. The position {{and shape of the}} rubber vee-blocks and Metalastik bushes are designed to ensure sufficiently rigid suspension mounting for good control whilst successfully isolating the body from NVH.|$|R

50|$|In {{automotive}} suspensions, {{a suspension}} link, control link or link is a suspension member, that attaches at only two points. One point being the body or {{frame of the}} vehicle and the other point attaching to the knuckle, upright, axle or another <b>link.</b> The <b>link</b> <b>pivots</b> on either a bushing or a ball joint at each attachment point. A link differs from a control arm because it can only control one of the degrees of freedom by itself.|$|R
40|$|A toggle {{mechanism}} pinches a metal {{tube and}} maintains the tube in a pinched condition, without fracturing. The toggle mechanism includes a plunger translatable along a longitudinal axis, {{as well as}} a pair of <b>links</b> <b>pivoted</b> about a common axis extending through an end of the plunger. One of the <b>links</b> also <b>pivots</b> about a fixed axis. A free end of the other link carries a push link which the other link translates at right angles to the plunger longitudinal axis. First and second sides of the tube bear against a first stop block and are engaged by the push link when a compression spring, attached to the plunger, is suddenly released to irreversibly drive the plunger along its longitudinal axis so the pivot point of the two links is driven to an over travel position...|$|R
500|$|The gun {{ports of}} the Warrior-class ships were built [...] wide, which allowed the 68-pounders to {{traverse}} 52°. While the ships were building the directing bar was developed {{which consisted of}} an iron bar that fastened to a <b>pivot</b> <b>bolt</b> in the sill of the gun port. After the gun carriages were modified, this allowed them to pivot {{much closer to the}} gun port than had previously been possible and meant that the gun ports could be narrowed to a width of [...] while retaining the same arc of fire. The gun ports were narrowed to the new width by [...] of wrought iron. Another delay was the modification of the armour plates with tongue and groove joints to lock the plates together and increase their resistance to armour-piercing shells. All together these modifications delayed the completion of Warrior by a year past her contract completion date.|$|R
50|$|Each {{lower link}} is {{fabricated}} from a steel tube with a two-pronged fork welded to each end. The outer {{end of the}} lower <b>link</b> <b>pivots</b> about a fulcrum shaft, which runs longitudinally through {{the bottom of each}} hub carrier. The inner fulcrum mounting is adjacent {{to the bottom of the}} differential casing. Wide spacing of the pivot bearings provides both torsional and fore-and-aft rigidity to the hub carrier. This prevents the hub carrier from twisting relative to the differential and is also necessary because, with driveshafts acting as the upper suspension links, the hub carrier has no other way of resisting fore-and-aft movement.|$|R
50|$|As a {{consequence}} of the radius arm forward attachments not being on the axis of the lower <b>link</b> arm inner <b>pivots,</b> it would appear at first glance that free movement of the suspension would be impossible without some components bending, or the trailing arm elastomeric bushes being compressed unduly. However, as described above, the crossbeam is rubber mounted to the body. The crossbeam and lower links maintain the correct toe angle of one wheel relative to the other, however due to the relative angles of the trailing radius arms, body roll results in the entire cross-beam and lower <b>links</b> <b>pivoting</b> slightly about the crossbeam's mounting points, thus inducing a small amount of passive rear wheel steering, which may result in significantly improved handling. When the Jaguar components are re-used in other vehicles, the differential is often rigidly mounted to the chassis, different radius arm configurations are used, and the passive rear wheel steering effect is lost.|$|R
2500|$|At this point, a <b>link</b> <b>pivots</b> {{the rear}} of the barrel down, out of locking {{recesses}} in the slide, and the barrel is stopped by making contact with the lower barrel lugs against the frame's vertical impact surface. [...] As the slide continues rearward, a claw extractor pulls the spent casing from the firing chamber and an ejector strikes {{the rear of}} the case, pivoting it out and away from the pistol. The slide stops and is then propelled forward by a spring to strip a fresh cartridge from the magazine and feed it into the firing chamber. At the forward end of its travel, the slide locks into the barrel and is ready to fire again.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout {{the years}} bicycle {{designers}} have produced belt-driven bicycles. While these belts cannot be shifted between gears like a chain, they offer singlespeed or hub geared drivetrains with improved increased wear resistance, quieter operation, and lubrication-free cleanliness. Belts {{also do not}} change length during their lifespan {{in the same way}} that chains [...] "stretch" [...] or increase in pitch as their <b>link</b> <b>pivots</b> wear. This keeps the pitch of the belt's teeth constant and dramatically decreases wear on gear teeth. Belts have failed to overtake chains in popularity for bicycles because they have historically been less efficient. Also replacement of the one-piece belt requires traditional diamond bicycle frames to have a split chainstay or seatstay.|$|R
50|$|The {{auxiliary}} crankshaft drove {{both the}} eccentric rods {{and the combination}} levers of the valve gear. The piston valves were of the outside admission type. The valve heads were connected by a double girder arrangement, each actuated by a vertical rocking shaft located between the two girders and midway between the two heads, with a further connecting <b>link</b> <b>pivoted</b> just behind the valve head nearest the front. A sealed oscillating shaft drove the offset upper rocker arm and link, and the whole assembly worked inside the exhaust space of the steam chest. The advantage of having admission steam working on the outside faces of the valves meant that the volume under maximum pressure was completely sealed at the ends with no glands susceptible to leakage.|$|R
5000|$|A main <b>link</b> which <b>pivoted</b> in {{the middle}} from {{the lower end of}} the swing links and whose lower end was {{connected}} to the eccentric rod (which in turn connects to the return crank on the driver, as in the Walschaert gear). This link had a characteristic [...] "J"-shape.|$|R
50|$|The {{damping force}} of a {{friction}} shock absorber is adjusted with the central <b>pivot</b> and clamping <b>bolt.</b> A star-shaped spring applies a force to the stack of disks. The damping force is roughly proportional to this force and the clamping nut is provided with a pointer arm to indicate the approximate setting.|$|R

5000|$|The term is {{commonly}} used in automotive technology for the link in steering linkage that converts rotation of a pitman arm to a steering arm and eventually to tie rod <b>links</b> which <b>pivot</b> the wheels to be steered. The drag link converts the sweeping arc of the steering arm to linear motion in {{the plane of the}} other steering links.|$|R
40|$|The {{current state}} of the {{practice}} in traffic signal system management is highly dependent on modeling of signal operations based on historical field data. While the initial design phase is typically rigorous, once systems are installed and timed, signal timing updates are infrequent. As agencies compete for increasingly limited resources, enhanced quantitative performance data from traffic signal systems is urgently needed. As such data becomes available, it is highly desirable to make use of it to improve operations. ^ This dissertation defines and demonstrates several tools for measuring the performance of traffic signal systems and improving operations using that information. A portfolio of performance measures is proposed, including an analysis of the intersection phase capacity utilization; progression quality for coordinated phases; and estimated motorist delay time. Techniques for aggregating this data on an arterial system level are presented, including prototype graphics and tables that would be useful for agency performance reports. ^ A new visualization graphic is developed called the Purdue Coordination Diagram (PCD), allowing a qualitative appraisal of coordinated phase performance. When coupled with quantitative data, the PCD is a powerful tool for analyzing offset performance in a coordinated signal system. Using a simple model, the PCD is used to predict the impact of changes to arterial offsets; the prediction is verified by field implementation, with observed performance slightly superior to the prediction. Probe vehicle travel times decrease by 1. 7 minutes (28 %) in the northbound direction on the arterial system; the difference is statistically significant. ^ Procedures are proposed that aggregate the high resolution data to improve the computational efficiency of offset optimization algorithms. A “Link Pivoting” algorithm for optimizing offsets on a linear arterial is introduced, which revisits the Combination Method of the 1960 s- 1970 s. <b>Link</b> <b>Pivoting</b> is compared against a heirarchical heuristic search, Monte Carlo simulation, and TRANSYT-style hill climbing, using alternate objective functions (maximize arrivals on green or minimize delay). <b>Link</b> <b>Pivoting</b> yielded the best performing offsets out of the algorithms tested, and is comparable to TRANSYT in terms of computational complexity. A simple model is proposed that extends the offset analysis methodology to include changes to cycle length. ...|$|R
25|$|The primary lead {{motion is}} {{provided}} by the crosshead arm (9) and the union <b>link</b> (11). This <b>pivoting</b> bar gives the in phase component of motion {{to the bottom of the}} combination lever (12).|$|R
5000|$|In the Gooch {{valve gear}} (invented by Daniel Gooch in 1843) the {{reversing}} and cut-off functions were achieved by raising or lowering a radius rod which connected the valve-rod to a [...] "stationary" [...] <b>link</b> <b>pivoting</b> around a fixed point. The advantages sought were reduced height for the gear and lighter action as the reversing lever was only required {{to lift the}} weight of the radius rod. This meant that the link was convex (in relation to the eccentrics) instead of concave. Gooch valve gear had the disadvantage of angularity between the valve spindle and the eccentric rod in full gear, whereas the best forms of the Stephenson gear, the thrust was in a straight line. The Gooch gear gave constant lead at whatever cutoff. This was observed to be a disadvantage when similar locomotives fitted with either Gooch or Stephenson gear were compared in service Gooch gear was never popular in Britain except with one or two engineers down to the 1860s, but it was quite common in France.|$|R

40|$|The NASA Decoupler Pylon is {{a passive}} means of suppressing wing-store flutter. The {{feasibility}} of demonstrating this concept on the F- 16 aircraft was established through model wind tunnel tests and analyses. As {{a result of}} these tests and studies a ship set of Decoupler Pylons was designed and fabricated for a flight test demonstration on the F- 16 aircraft. Basic design criteria were developed during the analysis study pertaining to pylon pitch stiffness, alignment system requirements, and damping requirements. A design was developed which utilized an electrical motor for the pylon alignment system. The design uses a four pin, two <b>link</b> <b>pivot</b> design which results in a remote pivot located at the center of gravity of the store when the store is in the aligned position. The pitch spring was fabricated from a tapered constant stress cantilevered beam. The pylon has the same external lines as the existing production pylon and is designed to use a MAU- 12 ejection rack which {{is the same as the}} one used with the production pylon. The detailed design and fabrication was supported with a complete ground test of the pylon prior to shipment to NASA...|$|R
5000|$|The {{complete}} {{rear suspension}} assembly is {{carried in a}} steel crossbeam (shown ghosted in the diagram below), which {{is attached to the}} vehicle body via four rubber vee-blocks and also carries the differential (blue) and inboard brakes (red). The rear wheels are located transversely by top links and wheel carriers (green) and lower links (cyan). The top link is the driving half-shaft with a universal joint at each end. The lower <b>link</b> <b>pivots</b> adjacent to the differential casing at its inboard end and where it meets the wheel carrier at the wheel hub casting (violet) at its outboard end. The pivot bearings {{at each end of the}} lower link are widely spaced so as to provide maximum longitudinal rigidity. Suspension is provided by two coil spring and damper units (yellow) on each side of the differential casing (four in total), the spring and damper units attaching to the crossbeam at the top and the lower link at the bottom. The crossbeam is located by two radius arms (see photo above) each of which runs forward from the lower link to a point on the vehicle body and is pivoted at each end via rubber bushings.|$|R
50|$|A center <b>pivot</b> pin is <b>bolted</b> to {{the body}} bolster. The center pivot pin runs down {{vertically}} {{through the center of}} the bogie bolster through the center pivot. It allows for rotation of the bogie when the coach is moving on the curves. A silent block, which is cylindrical metal rubber bonded structure, is placed in the central hole of the bogie bolster through which the center pivot pin passes. It provides the cushioning effect.|$|R
50|$|Mechanical {{lettering}} {{is sometimes}} done using a pantograph, a device consisting of four bars ("links") which are pinned {{to each other}} to form a parallelogram. The <b>links</b> can <b>pivot</b> about these pins. The lowermost link of the parallelogram is fixed to two rigid supports. One vertical link at one end is connected to a profile tracer, which traces {{the profile of the}} letter to be drawn, and the second vertical link and the other horizontal link are jointly connected to a pencil that draws the exact shape of the profile traced.|$|R
5000|$|In 1948, {{the company}} {{developed}} {{a series of}} motorcycles based on the T35. Designed by George Halliday, these featured Douglas [...] "Radialraulic" [...] forks with the front wheel spindle carried on short leading <b>links</b> <b>pivoted</b> {{at the rear of}} the fork stanchions - with springs and a damping mechanism inside the stanchions. Although the frame and suspension were innovative, the engine was essentially a generator, designed to run for long periods at a steady speed and it did not cope well with the varying engine speeds of motorcycling. There was also a tendency to sideways shaking at low engine speeds which was a feature of the horizontally opposed engine. Douglas hired former Sunbeam motorcycles designer Erling Poppe as Technical Director, Freddie Dixon as their specialist engine tuner and Walter Moore (who designed the Norton CS1) as Works Superintendent. The result was the 1949 Douglas Mark III, which had improved performance through an uprated cylinder head, combustion chambers, and pistons. Douglas also produced a Mark III [...] "De Luxe", a Mark III Sports, and a rigid-framed motorcycle trials Competition version with high-level exhausts and a less deeply valanced front mudguard. There never was a Douglas Mark II, and the Mark IV was short-lived, so the end of the line of development was the Mark V produced between 1951 and 1954, when it was replaced by the Douglas Dragonfly.|$|R

The fun came quickly enough--too quickly for Dede, who found herself against Bob's neck as he <b>pivoted</b> around and <b>bolted</b> the other way. Daylight followed on her horse and watched. He saw her check the animal quickly to a standstill, and immediately, with rein across neck and a decisive prod of the left spur, whirl him back the way he had come and almost as swiftly.|$|R
50|$|On the {{front-wheel drive}} Betas, Lancia {{designed}} a particularly original {{independent rear suspension}} with MacPherson struts attached to parallel transverse <b>links</b> that <b>pivoted</b> on a centrally mounted cross member bolted to {{the underside of the}} floorpan. An anti-roll bar was fitted to the floorpan ahead of the rear struts with both ends of the bar trailing back to bolt to the rear struts on each side. This unique design went on to be used in later Lancia models. The design was never patented by Lancia, and consequently inspired similar rear suspension system layouts in other manufacturers' vehicles during the 1980s and 1990s.|$|R
5000|$|Perhaps the {{simplest}} linkage is the lever, {{which is a}} <b>link</b> that <b>pivots</b> around a [...] attached to ground, or a fixed point. As a force rotates the lever, points far from the fulcrum have a greater velocity than points near the fulcrum. Because power into the lever equals the power out, a small force applied at a point far from the fulcrum (with greater velocity) equals a larger force applied at a point near the fulcrum (with less velocity). The amount the force is amplified is called mechanical advantage. This is {{the law of the}} lever.|$|R
40|$|Cycle length {{selection}} in corridor timing is often dictated by critical intersections {{with the highest}} level of saturation. Along corridors with balanced volumes and favorable link distances, a resonant cycle length is often sought to provide good progression in both directions of travel. This paper discusses the search for a resonant cycle length at a 5 -intersection corridor in Fishers, Indiana over a three month period. The software traffic model suggests a reasonable range of cycle lengths from 104 seconds to 124 seconds for the corridor. This cycle length range is consistent with analytical highway capacity manual delay minimization approaches. A set of eleven cycle lengths from the 104 to 124 -second range are tested over 12 weeks, with each iteration using optimized offset values generated by the <b>Link</b> <b>Pivot</b> progression optimization algorithm to maximize the percentage of vehicles arriving on green, and holding all phase splits constant. There was no obvious resonant cycle identified in the cycle length sweep, however the experiment findings indicate vehicles arriving on green decrease and travel times increase as cycle length increases. As a tradeoff, the number of force off phase terminations on the side-street phases decrease as a result of longer cycles indicating a better accommodation of sidestreet demand. Finally, a Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SURE) model was used to analyze the correlation between cycle lengths, percent of vehicles arriving on green, and travel time indicating a negative correlation between higher cycle length and progression performance...|$|R

We find link centered breathers for an odd number of mechanical <b>links</b> and <b>pivot</b> centered breathers where the number of links is even. Substantial parameter regions in load-frequency parameter space are found where these breathers are linearly and nonlinearly stable. This region includes the lattice in tension, in compression, and in the unloaded state. We also find that despite the rigid nature of this mechanical system both the lateral displacement and the energy-per-link are, at least, exponentially localized in the breather core...|$|R
