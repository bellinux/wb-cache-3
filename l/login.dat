5000|$|<b>Logins</b> {{started his}} career at the local club FK Rēzekne, being taken to the first team in 1999. At the age of 17 he made his debut in the Latvian Higher League. He played 16 matches {{throughout}} the season, but the club finished in the last position of the table, with only one victory and two draws. In 2000 <b>Logins</b> moved to Dinaburg Daugavpils, where he played until 2004. Till 2002 he was rarely used and often remained on the bench. Starting from 2002 his playing time increased and he also scored his first Latvian Higher League goal that season. On 23 June 2002 <b>Logins</b> made his UEFA competitions' debut, when Dinaburg Daugavpils played a 1-1 draw against Zagłębie Lubin in the UEFA Intertoto Cup first round. [...] In 2005 <b>Logins</b> moved to FK Ventspils. Even {{though he did not}} manage to settle at the club, <b>Logins</b> helped his team win the Latvian Cup. In 2006 <b>Logins</b> rejoined his previous club Dinaburg Daugavpils and remained there until 2009, with a short loan spell at Daugava Daugavpils in 2008. During this loan spell <b>Logins</b> managed to win the Latvian Cup {{for the second time in}} his career. Artjoms Rudņevs was his team mate, who joined Hamburger SV in 2012 and became the first Latvian player in the German Bundesliga. In September 2009 <b>Logins</b> moved abroad for the first time in his career and joined the Moldovan National Division club Dacia Chișinău. Being unused during the remaining period of the season, <b>Logins</b> left the club in January 2010 and was signed by Daugava Daugavpils. The club managed to qualify for the 2012-13 UEFA Europa League, but lost in the first round to Sūduva Marijampolė on aggregate. After the unsuccessful start Logins' contract, which would have been in force till the end of 2013, was terminated and he joined the German Regionalliga Nord club BSV Schwarz-Weiß Rehden as a free agent in September 2012. He scored one goal in 17 matches for the club throughout the season. In July 2013 <b>Logins</b> moved to the German Regionalliga Nordost club Lokomotive Leipzig, signing a contract till 30 June 2015.|$|R

In 2016 Smartsheet introduced Sights, a configurable dashboard that shows metrics such as how a team is performing against key performance indicators.|$|E
5|$|In October 2014, Twitter {{announced}} Fabric, a {{suite of}} mobile developer tools built around Crashlytics. Fabric brought together Crashlytics, Answers (mobile app analytics), Beta (mobile app distribution), Digits (mobile app identity and authentication services), MoPub, and TwitterKit (<b>login</b> with Twitter and Tweet display functionality) into a single, modular SDK, allowing developers {{to pick and choose}} which features they needed while guaranteeing ease of installation and compatibility. By building Fabric on top of Crashlytics, Twitter was {{able to take advantage of}} Crashlytics' large adoption and device footprint to rapidly scale usage of MoPub and TwitterKit. Fabric reached active distribution across 1 billion mobile devices just 8 months after its launch.|$|E

5|$|On July 29, 2014, C-SPAN {{announced}} that it would begin restricting access to the live feeds of the main channel, C-SPAN2 and C-SPAN3 to subscribers of cable or satellite providers later that summer, citing concerns with the slow shift in viewing habits from cable television to the internet due to its reliance on carriage fees from cable and satellite providers. However, it will continue to allow all government meetings, hearings and conferences to be streamed live online and via archived on the C-SPAN Video Library without requiring an authenticated <b>login</b> by a provider. The decision drew some criticism from public interest and government transparency advocates, citing the fact that C-SPAN was designed as a public service.|$|E
5|$|Privacy Control can warn users when sending {{confidential}} information. It {{can also}} be configured to block the transmission. It allows users to specify how the information can sent, such as via IM or e-mail. Item-specific exceptions allow users to control where there data can be sent. However, PC Pro found a flaw in the information filtering feature. The way information is formatted {{on the list of}} confidential information can affect its effectiveness. For example, entering the last six digits of a credit card number will not stop the numbers from leaking if they are grouped in four digits. PC Magazine also noted the fact anyone who can <b>login</b> to the computer can view the database of private information. For that reason, Symantec recommends entering only the last portion of sensitive information.|$|E

It analyzes sites, {{examining the}} website's URL, title, form, page layout, visible text and links, {{and uses a}} blacklist to detect phishing sites. Users are blocked access from suspected phishing sites, however are presented an option to continue. In PC Magazine testing, the feature blocked 22 of 24 phishing sites, while Internet Explorer 7 recognized 17 of the 24 sites. In PC Pro testing, the feature successfully blocked access to every phishing site it was tested against. Spam filtering no longer includes a language feature, Symantec claims it is less useful with current spam and created false positives. Tested against 1,500 messages by PC Magazine, Norton let {{over half of the}} spam to the inbox. Five percent of valid mail were marked as spam. This version utilizes Symantec's Veritas VxMS technology to better identify rootkits. VxMS allows Norton to find inconsistencies among files within directories and files at the volume level. A startup application manager allows users to prevent applications from launching at <b>login.</b> This release drops support for Windows 2000 and was compatible with Windows Vista upon its release with an update.|$|E
5|$|The first update {{was tied}} with April Fools' Day, with the {{addition}} of potatoes and gibberish sentences being in line with the pranks one normally sees on that day. Throughout the ARG, the players were monitored by the developers through the Internet Relay Chat, forums, and web sites that were being used to coordinate the solving effort. This allowed, for example, Two Tribes to prepare for Jake_R's visit, and the integration of a screenshot of the chat log into one of the puzzles. In another example, another chat room user, following a red herring, visited a physical location near the California studio for Team Meat; Edmund McMillen was able to arrange to meet the user and give him a signed copy of Super Meat Boy. Monitoring of the players enabled the developers to provide hints and clues for puzzles that players were struggling with as to allow the ARG to progress in a timely manner. While many puzzles of the ARG included cross-game cluessuch as finding the password for one of the Aperture Science <b>login</b> screens from another gameNeuse felt they could have increased the cross-game complexity of the puzzles if they had more time to plan it out. The developers were aided by the agility of Valve in its participation. During the second phase, one of the developers asked if Newell would become involved in the ARG. Newell then fed the image with the encrypted message to media outlets. Valve also placed hidden messages in promotional videos for Portal 2 which helped to point the ARG players in specific directions, including calling some of the players out by name.|$|E
