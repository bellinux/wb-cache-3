25|$|Drumm was intelligent, shrewd, {{and very}} pessimistic.

25|$|The {{comparative}} use of Census Bureau data, {{as well as}} most {{sources of}} demographic income data, has been questioned by statisticians for being unable to account for 'mobility of incomes'. At any given time, the Census Bureau ranks all households by household income and then divides this distribution of households into quintiles. The highest-ranked household in each quintile provides the upper income limit for each quintile. Comparing changes in these upper income limits for different quintiles is how changes are measured between one moment in time and the next. The problem with inferring income inequality on this basis is that the census statistics provide only a snapshot of income distribution in the U.S., at individual points in time. The statistics do not reflect the reality that income for many households changes over time – i.e., incomes are mobile. For most people, income increases over time as they move from their first, <b>low-paying</b> <b>job</b> in high school to a better-paying job later in their lives. Also, some people lose income over time because of business-cycle contractions, demotions, career changes, retirement, etc. The implication of changing individual incomes is that individual households do not remain in the same income quintiles over time. Thus, comparing different income quintiles over time is like comparing apples to oranges, because it means comparing incomes of different people at different stages in their earnings profile.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{increased}} government {{investments in}} education, West Virginia {{continues to have}} one of the nation's highest high school dropout rates and is among the states with the highest unemployment rates. Human capital theory provides the conceptual basis for evaluating the relationship between investment in education and economic development. An ordinary least squares regression method was used to examine the implications of high school dropouts in the economic development of West Virginia. Results revealed that increases in high school dropout rates and the state gross domestic product increased employment rates, while an increase in unemployment compensation decreased employment rates. Thus, the increase in employment rates may likely be in unskilled and <b>low-paying</b> <b>jobs.</b> The conclusions suggest several implications for policymakers. The opportunity cost to invest in education is low when an area is still attracting firms that require unskilled and <b>low-paying</b> <b>jobs.</b> As long as dropout rates positively correlate with unskilled and <b>low-paying</b> <b>jobs,</b> the poverty cycle in West Virginia will perpetuate.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This study assesses {{both the}} social {{polarisation}} hypothesis {{and the role}} migrants play in this process, using survey and population census data of the Johannesburg region of South Africa from 1970 to 2010. The manufacturing sector, once {{a major source of}} urban employment and consisting of a large percentage of skilled and semi-skilled, middle-income jobs has declined while the service sector, argued to consist of predominantly either high-skill, high-pay or low-skill, <b>low-pay</b> <b>jobs,</b> has grown. Thus, the decline of manufacturing and the growth of the service sector are argued to result in a more polarised society. Low-wage, low-skill service sector jobs are also argued to attract poorly-educated, unskilled immigrants unable to compete in the urban labour market for anything other than low-skill, <b>low-pay</b> <b>jobs.</b> Thus, the contention is that immigration contributes to social polarisation...|$|R
40|$|Conventional wisdom {{holds that}} women on welfare {{will be better}} off in the long run if they take a job, even if it means {{initially}} having less money to spend on their and their children's needs. Underlying this thinking is the belief that women who take <b>low-paying</b> <b>jobs</b> will eventually move up to higher paying jobs either with their current employer or by changing employers. This paper examines the employment transitions of young women focusing on the likelihood that women who turn to the welfare system for support will make the transition from <b>low-paying</b> to high-paying <b>jobs.</b> The data are drawn from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY). Based on the experiences of women who never received welfare, an estimated one-quarter of young women who received welfare could be firmly established in jobs paying more than $ 9. 50 an hour by ages 26 and 27. An additional 40 percent would work steadily but in <b>low-paying</b> <b>jobs,</b> and more than one-third would work only sporadically. © 2001 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management. ...|$|R
