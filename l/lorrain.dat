5|$|The {{earliest}} {{examples of}} Scottish landscape painting {{are in the}} tradition of Scottish house decoration for burgesses, lairds and lords, that arose after the Reformation in the sixteenth century, partly {{as a response to the}} loss of religious patronage. Most were of heraldry, classical myths and allegory, but there were a number of painted landscape scenes. These included the landscapes of four seasons in the Skelmorlie Aisle (1638) in the memorial chapel of the Montgomery family in Largs undertaken by James Stalker (fl. 1632–38). They indicate an awareness of contemporaneous Dutch landscape painting. The Flemish artist Alexander Keirincx (1600–52) was active in England and Scotland where he undertook commissions for Charles I, mainly of royal castles in Northern England and Scotland. These included one showing Seton House (1636–37) in its landscape, which is often said to be the earliest surviving painted landscape created in Scotland. The theme of house decoration with landscapes was taken up in the eighteenth century by James Norie (1684–1757), who worked beside the architect William Adam (1689–1748). Norie, with his sons James (1711–36) and Robert (d. 1766), painted the houses of the peerage with capriccios or pastiches of Italian and Dutch landscapes, bringing to Scotland the influence of French artists such as Claude <b>Lorrain</b> and Nicolas Poussin. The Nories were also important figures in professionalisation of Scottish art and the development of art education.|$|E

25|$|Art {{from this}} period shows {{influences}} from both the north of Europe, namely the Dutch and Flemish schools, and from Roman painters of the Counter-Reformation. Artists in France frequently debated the contrasting merits of Peter Paul Rubens with his the Flemish baroque, voluptuous lines and colors to Nicolas Poussin with his rational control, proportion, Roman classicism.

25|$|Regional {{identification}} is most pronounced today in cultures linked to regional languages and non-French-speaking traditions - French language itself being only a dialect of Langue d'oïl, the mother language {{of many of}} the languages to-be-mentioned, which became a national vehicular language, like (in alphabetical order): Alsatian, Arpitan, Basque, Brezhoneg (Breton), Burgundian, Corsu (Corsican), Català (Catalan), Francique, Gallo, <b>Lorrain,</b> Norman, Occitan, Picard, Poitevin, Saintongeais, etc., and some of these regions have promoted movements calling for some degree of regional autonomy, and, occasionally, national independence (see, for example, Breton nationalism, Corsica and Occitania).|$|E
25|$|The 17th {{century was}} one of intense artistic {{achievements}} : French painting emerged with a distinct identity, moving from Baroque to Classicism. Famous classic painters of the 17th century in France are Nicolas Poussin and Claude <b>Lorrain.</b> French architecture also proved influential with the Palace of Versailles, built for the powerful king Louis XIV, becoming the model of many European royal palaces. During the 18th century the Rococo style emerged as a frivolous continuation of the Baroque style. The most famous painters of the era were Antoine Watteau, François Boucher and Jean-Honoré Fragonard.

The large gold medallion from the Academy won in 1767 included a travel stipend, which he waited five years to receive. He assisted Professor Mandelberg of the Academy as an apprentice around 1769 and for painting decorations for the royal palace at Fredensborg.

5000|$|While {{the tune}} was {{composed}} {{prior to the}} Legion's departure for Mexico in the 1860s the lyrics were progressively composed after the Franco-Prussian War, since Alsatians and <b>Lorrains</b> flocked to the legion after these regions were annexed by Germany. The song makes also repeated reference {{to the fact that}} the Belgians are [...] "lazy shirkers", this comes from the fact that the King of the Belgians, who wished to remain neutral in the Franco-German conflict, asked the French government to not commit the Belgian Legionnaires into the conflict. France agreed to this request and the Belgian Legionnaires remained in French Algeria (the Legion's home), to the dismay of the rest of the Legionnaires. This is why the song says that there's no blood sausage (boudin) for the Belgians. The song also mentions the Swiss who constituted the most important foreign contingent of the Legion in the 1870s.|$|R
40|$|L’architecture gothique des pays de langue allemande est le produit d’un {{processus}} d’échanges culturels, accompagné de multiples innovations tant {{au niveau}} technique qu’au niveau social. C’est précisément dans le domaine des techniques de construction que le récent essor qu’a connu l’archéologie du bâti en Allemagne a généré un large éventail de nouvelles conclusions. Mais la dimension sociale des innovations artistiques a été, elle aussi l’objet d’une attention accrue de la part de la recherche allemande, qui pose la question des fonctions des monuments et des intentions des commanditaires. Sur le plan de l’histoire stylistique, les chantiers <b>lorrains</b> et alsaciens ont joué un rôle de relais dans la transmission vers l’est des nouvelles formes venues de l’ouest. Ce fut, dans un premier temps, la cathédrale de Reims dont le répertoire de formes a fait l’objet d’un transfert vers les pays de langue allemande, par l’intermédiaire du chantier de la cathédrale deToul. Plus tard, les normes du style rayonnant ont cheminé vers l’est, en passant par les cathédrales de Metz, de Cologne et de Strasbourg. L’intensité des échanges artistiques illustre de manière frappante le fait que les frontières nationales actuelles n’avaient pas une grande importance au Moyen Âge. C’est pourquoi l’époque du gothique s’inscrit tout particulièrement au patrimoine culturel européen et à ce titre elle mériterait de la part de la recherche une attention plus soutenue que ce qu’elle a connu jusqu’à présent. Religious architecture in Germany from 1220 to 1350, by Marc Carel Schurr Gothic architecture in German-speaking countries {{is the product}} of a process of cultural exchange, accompanied by numerous innovations both technical and social. It is in the area of construction techniques that the many recent studies in building archaeology in Germany have generated a wide range of new conclusions. But the social dimension of artistic innovation has also been the object of growing attention in Germany, posing questions about the functions of monuments and the intentions of patrons. With regard to the history of style, worksites in Lorraine and Alsace played a relay-role in the transmission of new forms from the west to the east. An early example is the case of the cathedral of Reims, whose repertory of forms was transferred toward German-speaking countries by way of the construction site of the cathedral of Toul. Later the norms of the rayonnant style moved eastward via the cathedrals ofMetz, Cologne and Strasburg. The intensity of the artistic exchanges illustrates in a striking way the irrelevance of modern political borders to the understanding of the Middle Ages. The Gothic period thus has a particular place in the European cultural heritage and merits more sustained research attention than it has previously received. Die kirchliche Baukunst in Deutschland zwischen 1220 und 1350, von Marc Carel Schurr Die gotische Architektur in den deutschsprachigen Ländern ist das Produkt eines europäischen kulturellen Austauschprozesses, der begleitet ist von zahlreichen Innovationen technischer und gesellschaftlicher Natur. Gerade im Bereich der Bautechnik hat der Aufschwung der Bauarchäologie in Deutschland interessante neue Ergebnisse auf breiter Front erbracht. Aber auch die gesellschaftliche Dimension der künstlerischen Neuerungen hat in der deutschen Forschung ein vertieftes Interesse gefunden, welches nach den Funktionen der Bauwerke und den Intentionen der Auftraggeber fragt. Stilgeschichtlich erweisen sich die Bauhütten in Lothringen und im Elsass als die Vermittler der neuen Formen undTechniken vonWest nach Ost. Vorbildlich war zunächst die Kathedrale von Reims gewesen, deren Formenrepertoire über die Bauhütte der Kathedrale von Toul in die deutschsprachigen Länder vermittelt wurde. Später waren es die Prinzipien des style rayonnant, welche über die Bauhütten von Metz, Köln und Strassburg ihren Weg nach Osten fanden. Die Intensität des künstlerischen Austausches ist ein beeindruckender Beleg dafür, dass die heutigen nationalen Grenzen imMittelalter keine grosse Bedeutung hatten. Die gotische Epoche erscheint daher in einem besonderen Mass als gemeinsames europäisches Kulturerbe und sollte von der Forschung noch stärker als bisher dementsprechend behandelt werden.

25|$|A {{different}} type of landscape, produced throughout the tonal and classical phases, was the romantic Italianate landscape, typically in more mountainous settings than {{are found in the}} Netherlands, with golden light, and sometimes picturesque Mediterranean staffage and ruins. Not all the artists who specialized in these had visited Italy. Jan Both (d. 1652), who had been to Rome and worked with Claude <b>Lorrain,</b> was a leading developer of the subgenre, which influenced the work of many painters of landscapes with Dutch settings, such as Aelbert Cuyp. Other artists who consistently worked in the style were Nicolaes Berchem (1620–1683) and Adam Pijnacker. Italianate landscapes were popular as prints, and more paintings by Berchem were reproduced in engravings during the period itself than those of any other artist.|$|E
25|$|Walloons {{traditionally}} also speak regional Romance languages, {{all from}} the Langues d'oïl group. Wallonia includes {{almost all of the}} area where Walloon is spoken, a Picard zone corresponding to the major part of the Province of Hainaut, the Gaume (district of Virton) with the <b>Lorrain</b> language and a Champenois zone. There are also regional Germanic languages, such as the Luxembourgish language in Arelerland (Land of Arlon). The regional languages of Wallonia are more important than in France, and they have been officially recognized by the government. With the development of education in French, however, these dialects have been in continual decline. There is currently an effort to revive Walloon dialects; some schools offer language courses in Walloon, and Walloon is also spoken in some radio programmes, but this effort remains very limited.|$|E
25|$|Ordinaries {{were often}} accused on the {{newspapers}} by competing writers of criminal lives of fabricating the last dying speeches of the condemned and of manipulating their position to extract confessions from them.

Accusations of withholding the sacrament under the pretense of the criminals not being prepared but in reality with the goal to get an account {{of their lives and}} transactions were common. Even if some of the condemned were really compelled to confess sins which laid heavily on their conscience, most of them did so only to qualify for the sacrament, acknowledging a catalogue of general misdeeds and stopping short of admitting to more serious crimes, especially the one of which they were accused of for fear of jeopardising their chances of a reprieve.|$|E

25|$|The Merovingian Franks {{gradually}} {{gained control}} of the region during the 5th century, under Clovis. Due to the fragmentation of the former Roman Empire, Vulgar Latin regionally developed along different lines and evolved into several langue d'oïl dialects, which in Wallonia became Picard, Walloon and <b>Lorrain.</b> The oldest surviving text written in a langue d'oïl, the Sequence of Saint Eulalia, has characteristics of these three languages and was likely written in or very near {{to what is now}} Wallonia around 880 AD. From the 4th to the 7th century, the Franks established several settlements, probably mostly in the north of the province where the romanization was less advanced and some Germanic trace was still present. The language border began to crystallize between 700 under the reign of the Merovingians and Carolingians and around 1000 after the Ottonian Renaissance. French-speaking cities, with Liège as the largest one, appeared along the Meuse river and Gallo-Roman cities such as Tongeren, Maastricht and Aachen became Germanized.|$|E
