Direct imununofluorescent studies in 2 of 6 patients tested revealed IgM and C 3 deposition in and about dermal blood vessels. Nine of the 10 systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients</b> displayed active clinical disease (e. g., arthritis, renal disease, etc.), a positive lupus band test, antibodies against deoxyribonucleic acid or Sm macromolecules, serum hypocomplementemia and markedly elevated quantities of serum immune complexes {{as determined by}} an immununoradiometric assay employing Raji cells. Similar lesions were not detected in 35 discoid <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients.</b> These studies strongly suggest: (1) urticaria-like lesions are uncommon cutaneous manifestations of systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus.</b> (2) These urticaria-like lesions do not represent a classic IgE mediated urticaria.

METHODS: A nationwide population-based cohort study using the National Health Insurance Research Database identified 10, 337 new cases of systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> as the study cohort. In addition, 62, 022 <b>patients</b> without systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus,</b> who were matched for age, gender, and date of systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> diagnosis, were used as the comparison cohort. These cohorts were followed-up for three years. A Cox proportional hazard regression was performed to estimate the risk ratio of herpes zoster, with adjustments for age, gender, level of insurance, urbanization level, geographic region, comorbid medical conditions, average daily dosage of corticosteroids, and the use of immune-modulation agents. RESULTS: Compared to <b>patients</b> without systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus,</b> the crude risk ratio and adjusted risk ratio of herpes zoster among systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients</b> were 7. 37 (95 % confidence interval 6. 75 - 8. 04) and 2. 45 (95 % confidence interval 1. 77 - 3. 40), respectively. Stratified by gender, the adjusted risk ratio of herpes zoster was 2. 10 (95 % confidence interval 1. 45 - 2. 99) in women and 7. 51 (95 % confidence interval 2. 89 - 19. 52) in men. Stratified by age, the adjusted risk ratio peaked in systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients</b> who were aged 18 to 24 years (risk ratio 8. 78, 95 % confidence interval 3. 08 - 24. 97).

40|$|Using a radioimmunological method {{performed}} in the presence and absence of the acetylcholine agonist decamethonium (DC), it was demonstrated that 98 % of myasthenia gravis (MG) patients' sera (positive for anti-acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR) antibody titres in the conventional assay) contain antibodies that block the binding of alpha bungarotoxin (alpha Bgt) to human AChR. The positive effect of myasthenic immunoglobulins against the alpha Bgt toxicity was revealed by a test devised to investigate the biological significance of these blocking antibodies in vivo in Balb/c mice. IgG from sera containing blocking antibodies, detected either directly or {{in the presence of}} DC, protected the mice treated (24 of 25); nevertheless no overt clinical signs of a myasthenic syndrome were observed. Control IgG, from normal human sera or from a systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patient,</b> provided no protection (22 dead out of 26). IgG from MG sera devoid of anti-AChR antibodies (eight out of eight) and IgG from serum containing anti-AChR antibodies but devoid of blocking antibodies offered no defence against alpha Bgt toxicity (13 dead out of 15).

40|$|B cell {{activation}} {{is regulated}} through {{the interplay of}} the BCR with the inhibitory coreceptor Fc gamma RIIB and the activating coreceptor CD 19. Recent studies suggest that Ag-driven BCR microclusters are efficiently converted to a signaling active state on colocalization with CD 19 microclusters. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy-based, high-resolution, high-speed live-cell and molecule imaging approaches, we show that when co-ligated to the BCR, the Fc gamma RIIB can inhibit B cell activation by blocking the colocalization of BCR and CD 19 microclusters within the B cell immunological synapse. Remarkably, this inhibitory function of FcgRIIB is dependent not on its well-characterized ITIM-containing cytoplasmic domain, but its transmembrane domain. Indeed, human primary B cells from systemic lupus erythematosus patients homozygous for gene encoding the loss-of-function transmembrane domain mutant Fc gamma RIIB-I 232 T fail to block the synaptic colocalization of the BCR with CD 19, leading to dysregulated recruitment of downstream signaling molecule p-PI 3 K to membrane proximal signalosome. This inhibitory function of Fc gamma RIIB in impairing the spatial-temporal colocalization of BCR and CD 19 microclusters in the B cell immunological synapse may help explain the hyper-reactive features of systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patient</b> B cells in reported studies. These observations may also provide new targets for therapies for systemic autoimmune disease...|$|E

Two were localized depositions {{limited to the}} lung while in the remainder, lung involvement {{was part of the}} picture of systemic amyloidosis. Both cases of localized amyloidosis presented with symptomatic lung/bronchial masses and a clinical diagnosis of tumour. Histology revealed "amyloidomas" associated with heavy plasma cell and lymphocytic infiltration and the presence of multinucleated giant cells. In both cases, the amyloid deposits were immunopositive for lambda light chains and negative for kappa chains and AA protein. One was a known systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patient</b> with polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia. The other patient was found to have plasma cell dyscrasia with monoclonal IgG lambda gammopathy. Both patients did not develop systemic amyloidosis. In contrast, lung involvement in systemic AA amyloidosis was not obvious clinically or macroscopically but was histologically evident in 75 % of cases subjected to autopsy. Amyloid was detected mainly in the walls of arterioles and small vessels, and along the alveolar septa. It was less frequently detected in the pleura, along the basement membrane of the bronchial epithelium and around bronchial glands. In one case of systemic AL amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma, an "amyloidoma" occurred in the subpleural region reminiscent of localized amyloidosis. These cases pose questions on (1) whether localized "tumour-like" amyloidosis is a forme fruste of systemic AL amyloidosis and (2) the differing pattern of tissue deposition of different chemical types of amyloid fibrils, with the suggestion that light chain amyloid has a greater tendency to nodular deposition than AA amyloid...|$|E

Steroids (glucocorticoids) suppress SLE fever; however, {{the extent to which}} steroid therapy affects SLE fever not previously been rigorously studied. MethodsStudy A is a prospective study of recurrently active SLE patients (N = 92, 60 renal SLE and 32 nonrenal SLE) who recorded daily oral evening temperatures while participating in a longitudinal study of risk factors for SLE flare. Study B is a retrospective study of consecutive febrile SLE patients (N = 22) who received steroids initially because SLE was suspected. At final analysis 11 had SLE fever and 11 had infection fever. ResultsIn study A during a mean follow-up of 13. 2 ± 8. 1 months, 51 of the 92 patients experienced 73 SLE flares. In only one patient was SLE fever associated with SLE flare. In the other 50 patients who flared, there was no significant trend to develop fever prior to or at the onset of SLE flare. Prednisone, median dose 10 mg, was being received at 82 % of the study visits at which an SLE flare was declared. In study B, prednisone 28 mg (range 20 to 40 mg) completely suppressed SLE fever, usually within 24 hours. In contrast, infection fever persisted despite prednisone 35 to 300 mg/day. Of those with infection fever, three developed fatal sepsis when high-dose steroid therapy was continued. ConclusionIn SLE patients receiving prednisone at maintenance doses or greater, SLE fever is rare. When fever does develop, it is usually due to infection. Continuing high steroid dose steroid therapy in those with infection fever may increase the risk of severe sepsis...|$|E
40|$|IF 2. 454 International audienceObjective The lupus impact tracker (LIT) is a 10 -item patient {{reported}} outcome tool {{to measure}} the impact of systemic lupus erythematosus or its treatment on patients' daily lives. Herein, we describe the responsiveness of the LIT and LupusQoL to changes in disease activity, using the systemic lupus erythematosus responder index (SRI). Methods A total of 325 adult systemic lupus erythematosus patients were enrolled in an observational, longitudinal, multicentre study, conducted across the USA and Canada. Data (demographics, LIT, LupusQoL, BILAG, SELENA-SLEDAI) were obtained three months apart. Modified SRI was defined as: a decrease in SELENA-SLEDAI (4 points); no new BILAG A, and no greater than one new BILAG B; and no increase in the physician global assessment. Standardised response mean and effect size for LIT and LupusQoL domains were calculated among SRI responders and non-responders. Wilcoxon's {{test was used to}} compare the LIT and LupusQoL variation by SRI responder status. Results Of the participants 90 % were women, 53 % were white, 33 % were of African descendant and 17 % were Hispanic. Mean (SD) age and SELENA-SLEDAI at baseline were 42. 3 (16. 2) years and 4. 3 (3. 8), respectively. Mean (SD) LIT score at baseline was 39. 4 (22. 9). LIT standardised response mean (effect size) among SRI responders and non-responders were - 0. 69 (- 0. 36) and - 0. 20 (- 0. 12), respectively (P[*]=[*] 0. 02). For LupusQoL, two domains were responsive to SRI: standardised response mean (effect size) for physical health and pain domains were 0. 42 (0. 23) and 0. 65 (0. 44), respectively.

40|$|Abstract Background Systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> is an age- and gender-associated {{autoimmune}} disorder. Previous studies {{suggested that}} defects in the hypothalamic/pituitary axis contributed to systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> disease progression which could also involve growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor- 1 and somatostatin function. This {{study was designed}} to compare basal serum growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor- 1 and somatostatin levels in female systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients</b> to a group of normal female subjects. Methods Basal serum growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor- 1 and somatostatin levels were measured by standard radioimmunoassay. Results Serum growth hormone levels failed to correlate with age (r 2 = 3. 03) in the entire group of normal subjects (i. e. 20 – 80 years). In contrast, serum insulin-like growth factor- 1 levels were inversely correlated with age (adjusted r 2 = 0. 092). Of note, serum growth hormone was positively correlated with age (adjusted r 2 = 0. 269) in the 20 – 46 year range which overlapped with the age range of patients in the systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> group. In that regard, serum growth hormone levels were not significantly higher compared to either the entire group of normal subjects (20 – 80 yrs) or to normal subjects age-matched to the systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients.</b> Serum insulin-like growth factor- 1 levels were significantly elevated (p 55 yrs) systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients.</b> Conclusions These results indicated that systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> was not characterized by a modulation of the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor- 1 paracrine axis when serum samples from systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients</b> were compared to age- matched normal female subjects. These results in systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> differ from those previously reported in other musculoskeletal disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis and hypermobility syndrome where significantly higher serum growth hormone levels were found.

Serum IL- 17 levels were not associated with disease activity (p= 0. 32), cumulative damage (p= 0. 34), or medication use (p= 0. 63). CONCLUSION: IL- 17 is increased in childhood-onset systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> and {{may play a role}} in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric and renal manifestations. Longitudinal studies are necessary to {{determine the}} role of IL- 17 in childhood-onset systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus...</b>|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Alexithymia and {{depressive}} mood {{have been described}} as important dimensions of several medical diseases. Systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> is a chronic condition characterized by unpredictable clinical manifestations. The relationships between alexithymia, depression, and illness perception were examined in systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients.</b> The interrelationships between psychological factors, such as alexithymia and {{depressive mood}}, were explored in systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients,</b> and associations between these factors and illness perception in SLE were examined. We hypothesized that alexithymia and negative perceptions of illness would be associated in SLE patients, and depression would mediate this relationship. METHODS: Subjects were 100 consecutive systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients</b> attending the outpatient clinic at the University of Pisa rheumatology unit. They completed the Toronto Alexithymia Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, and Revised Illness Perceptions Questionnaire. Clinical variables were measured, disease activity was evaluated using the European Consensus Lupus Activity Measure, and damage was assessed using the Systemic Lupus International Collaborative Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index. RESULTS: There were no associations between clinical variables, alexithymia, and depression. The results highlight the existence of significant links between alexithymia and illness perception for systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients.</b> Moreover, our data suggest that some of these links are mediated by depression, which is the direct predictor of different aspects of perceived health. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that studying the role of psychological factors, such as alexithymia and depression, may contribute to a more comprehensive perspective of systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus,</b> including their impact on patients' beliefs about treatment effectiveness and emotional adaptation to chronic disease...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the serum levels of interferon alpha in childhood-onset systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients,</b> their first-degree relatives and healthy controls and {{to evaluate the}} associations between serum interferon alpha and disease activity, laboratory findings and treatment features. METHODS: We screened consecutive childhood-onset systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients</b> in a longitudinal cohort at the pediatric rheumatology unit of the State University of Campinas between 2009 and 2010. All patients demonstrated disease onset {{before the age of}} 16. Disease status was assessed according to the Systemic <b>Lupus</b> <b>Erythematosus</b> Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) and Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index (SDI). Interferon alpha levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay. RESULTS: We included 57 childhood-onset systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients</b> (mean age 17. 33 +/- 4. 50), 64 first-degree relatives (mean age 39. 95 +/- 5. 66), and 57 healthy (mean age 19. 30 +/- 4. 97) controls. Serum interferon alpha levels were significantly increased in childhood-onset systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients</b> compared to their first-degree relatives and healthy controls. Interferon alpha levels were significantly increased in patients with positive dsDNA antibodies, patients with cutaneous vasculitis, patients with new malar rash and patients who were not receiving medication. Interferon alpha levels correlated with C 3 levels and systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> Disease Activity Index scores. In addition, we observed an inverse correlation between patient age and interferon alpha levels. CONCLUSION: Interferon alpha {{may play a role in}} the pathogenesis of childhood-onset systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus,</b> especially in cutaneous manifestations and dsDNA antibody formation. The observation that interferon alpha levels are increased in patients who are not taking medication should be investigated in longitudinal studies to determine whether elevated interferon alpha levels may predict systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> flares...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the IgE serum levels in {{juvenile}} systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients</b> and to evaluate possible associations with clinical and laboratory features, disease activity and tissue damage. METHODS: The IgE serum concentrations in 69 consecutive juvenile systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients</b> were determined by nephelometry. IgG, IgM and IgA concentrations were measured by immunoturbidimetry. All patients were negative for intestinal parasites. Statistical analysis methods included the Mann-Whitney, chi-square and Fisher's exact tests, as well as the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Increased IgE concentrations above 100 IU/mL were observed in 31 / 69 (45 %) juvenile systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients.</b> The mean IgE concentration was 442. 0 +/- 163. 4 IU/ml (range 3. 5 - 9936. 0 IU/ml). Fifteen of the 69 patients had atopic disease, nine patients had severe sepsis and 56 patients presented with nephritis. The mean IgE level in 54 juvenile systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients</b> without atopic manifestations was 271. 6 +/- 699. 5 IU/ml, and only nine of the 31 (29 %) patients with high IgE levels had atopic disease. The IgE levels did not statistically differ with respect to the presence of atopic disease, severe sepsis, nephritis, disease activity, or tissue damage. Interestingly, IgE concentrations were inversely correlated with C 4 levels (r = - 0. 25, p = 0. 03) and with the SLICC/ACR-DI score (r = - 0. 34, p = 0. 005). The IgE concentration was also found to be directly correlated with IgA levels (r = 0. 52, p = 0. 03). CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated for the first time that juvenile systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients</b> have increased IgE serum levels. This increase in IgE levels was not related to allergic or parasitic diseases. Our results are in line with the hypothesis that high IgE levels can be considered a marker of immune dysregulation.

40|$|Objective: We {{investigated}} ADAMTS 13 (a disintegrin-like and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) messenger RNA {{levels as}} a biomarker of disease features in systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus.</b> Methods: We measured and compared messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of ADAMTS 13 in peripheral blood cells in <b>patients</b> with systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> and healthy control subjects by whole-genome microarray. We retrospectively analyzed the correlations of ADAMTS 13 mRNA expression with clinical features, laboratory parameters, therapeutic features, and disease activity (according to the Systemic <b>Lupus</b> <b>Erythematosus</b> Disease Activity Index). We also examined {{the association of}} three single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs 4962145, rs 2285467, and rs 685523) of the ADAMTS 13 gene with patient characteristics. Results: In 309 patients, the median ADAMTS 13 mRNA expression levels were significantly higher in blood cells of systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients</b> than in 23 healthy controls (p =. 03). Notably, ADAMTS 13 mRNA expression levels were significantly higher in systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients</b> {{with a history of}} stroke (p =. 02) or transient ischemic attack (p =. 02). Among the three single nucleotide polymorphisms analyzed, rs 2285467 was significantly associated with stroke (p =. 03) and anticardiolipin antibodies (p =. 04). Conclusions: Increased expression of ADAMTS 13 mRNA in blood cells is associated with the presence of ischemic cerebrovascular disease in systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients</b> and suggests a potential role for ADAMTS 13 in the pathogenesis of ischemic cerebrovascular disease in these patients...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the feasibility of}} bone turnover markers {{for the assessment of}} bone metabolism in <b>patients</b> with systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus,</b> according to the guidelines of the International Osteoporosis Foundation and the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine. MethodsThe study included 43 female systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients.</b> Serum procollagen type I N propeptide, C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen, osteocalcin, parathyroid hormone, 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 2 and 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3, anti-cardiolipin, anti-dsDNA, and anti-nucleosome levels were measured. ResultsProcollagen type I N propeptide and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen levels were elevated in systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients</b> aged > 45 in comparison to those aged 45 (p< 0. 001). No significant difference in procollagen type I N propeptide, osteocalcin or C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen levels was found with respect to season, neither in the entire systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> group nor in the under- 45 or over- 45 groups. Previous glucocorticoid treatment was not associated with difference in bone turnover markers. ConclusionsIncreased bone turnover markers in systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> appear to predominantly reflect the pattern of bone remodeling related to age. Increased procollagen type I N propeptide {{is expected to be the}} most frequent outcome among bone turnover markers. Better diagnoses of bone disturbances with bone turnover markers performed in accordance with international reference standards need to be included in the approach to systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients,</b> in addition to bone mineral density assessment...|$|R
40|$|Cryptococcal {{meningitis}} is {{an important}} fungal infection among systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients.</b> We conducted a pooled analysis and systematic review to describe the epidemiological and clinical profile of cryptococcal meningitis in systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients.</b> From two hospitals in China and nine literature databases, cases and prevalence data were collected for pooled analysis and meta-analysis, respectively. Categorical variables of cases were compared using a χ(2) -test on the statistical program of SAS. A multiple regression analysis was performed to ascertain independent predictors significantly correlated with prognosis. Meta-analysis was conducted by the statistical program of R. The prevalence of cryptococcal meningitis in systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients</b> was 0. 5 %. Patients were predominantly females and adults. A prednisone equivalent of more than 30 [*]mg/day before infection was associated with higher mortality (odds ratio (OR) = 9. 69 (1. 54, 60. 73)). In all, 36. 8 - 38. 9 % patients showed low lupus activity when they developed the crytococcal infection. Moreover, 38. 2 % of the patients were misdiagnosed. The estimated case-fatality rate was 23. 6 %. Our results suggest that more emphasis should be placed to further understand lupus-related cryptococcal meningitis and to develop better prophylaxis and management strategies to combat this condition...|$|R
40|$|Central {{nervous system}} (CNS) {{involvement}} {{is a common}} and important complication in systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus.</b> The mechanisms for CNS involvement are poorly understood and reliable diagnostic procedures are lacking. Pairs of serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from 17 patients with clinical and serological manifestations of systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> were analysed. All 11 patients with definite or suspect clinical CNS disorder revealed some kind of abnormality in the CSF, in contrast to three of seven systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients</b> without CNS disorder. The most prominent findings in systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients</b> with CNS disorder were immune aberrations with oligoclonal bands on agarose isoelectric focusing (AIF) and elevation of IgG and IgM index, probably reflecting intrathecal production of IgG and IgM respectively. Intrathecal production of antiviral antibodies was found in four of 12 patients by AIF followed by immunofixation and subsequent autoradiography.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{characterize}} the inflammatory profiles of <b>patients</b> with systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> receiving standard treatment compared to healthy controls. Patients and methodsPeripheral venous blood was collected from systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients</b> (n= 14) and controls (n= 18) at enrollment. Blood samples {{were used for}} quantification, by flow cytometry, of CD 11 b (integrin) and Chemokine receptor CXCR 2 expression surface antigen in neutrophils and lymphocytes, while cytokines were assayed in serum samples. Purified neutrophils were assayed by their ability to phagocytize human plasma-opsonized zymosan. ResultsPatients had a median (interquartile range) disease activity index of 1. 0 (0 – 2. 0) characteristic of patients in remission. Interleukin- 6 and interleukin- 10 serum concentrations were significantly higher in the patient group compared to controls and the phagocytic index of circulating neutrophils was significantly reduced in patients compared to controls. The levels of interleukin- 2, interleukin- 5, interleukin- 8 and tumor necrosis factor alpha did not significantly differ between patients and controls. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the integrin expression levels were reduced in lymphocytes (but not in neutrophils) obtained from systemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients,</b> while surface expression of the chemokine receptor 2 was similar in both neutrophils and lymphocytes. ConclusionSystemic <b>lupus</b> <b>erythematosus</b> <b>patients</b> receiving standard treatment presented with elevated systemic levels of interleukin- 6 and interleukin- 10, reduced neutrophil phagocytic capacity, and reduced lymphocyte expression of integrin even when symptoms were in remission.
