5|$|Alone with Shuu, Ryouta finally remembers {{what he had}} {{forgotten}} due to the traumatic nature of the events: he recognizes the doctor {{as a man who}} promised to grant his wish for peace between birds and humans after he and the protagonist witnessed a human terrorist incident at a bird orphanage in which the protagonist's parents, crisis negotiators, were killed, and that the protagonist died when she visited him in the infirmary. It is revealed that she died by Charon virus after coming in contact with Ryouta, as Shuu had induced the virus into Ryouta's body though grafts from Nageki's remains for the purpose of using him to exterminate humanity—since there can be no more fighting between two factions if one is wiped out, this would grant Ryouta's wish. Shuu then remarks that Labor 9 was powered by the protagonist's now irreversibly damaged brain. A broken Ryouta submits to Shuu's offer of becoming a living weapon of mass destruction after these revelations, and a struggle ensues during which the protagonist's spirit intervenes. Ryouta then asks Shuu why he decided to grant his wish, to which it is implied that Shuu's affection towards Ryouta's deceased father, Ryuuji, was greater than Shuu himself would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit,</b> and that he was motivated by Ryuuji's dying request: to do something for his son.|$|E
5|$|Tucker and Devon {{continue}} to bond over their shared interest in music while Tucker manages {{to put aside}} his differences with Katherine. He and Harmony later find a specialist to operate on Devon to fully repair his hearing. Afterward, Ashley and Tucker begin having marital problems when it is revealed that Tucker {{had a relationship with}} Genevieve Atkinson, Jack's ex-fiancée, when they were teens. Ashley decides they need a break and before leaving town, she catches Tucker and Harmony in bed and files for divorce. Tucker's actions destroy all the progress he's made with Devon, but the two manage to rebuild their relationship. Tucker supports Ashley when Abby is supposedly kidnapped and they even share a kiss but Ashley still serves him with divorce papers. Tucker then began to advise Sharon Newman (Sharon Case) to take more power at Newman Enterprises, as Victor had disappeared after their wedding. She takes over as CEO while beginning an affair with Tucker; in reality, Tucker had hired Genevieve to find Victor and keep him away from Genoa City so Tucker can buy up all of the Newman Enterprises stock. Once Victor was presumed dead in Los Angeles, Sharon decided to marry Tucker, but Genevieve turned her back on Tucker and brought Victor back alive, who stopped the wedding. With Victor alive, Jack was forced to sell all of his Newman stock as well as Beauty of Nature to Tucker in order to make his margin call. Yet, Jack, with Genevieve's help, tried to blackmail Tucker to win back Beauty of Nature or else the SEC would investigate his recent actions. Tucker decided to face the SEC and sell Beauty of Nature back to Victor in order to stop Victor from pursuing continuing a criminal investigation into Sharon's actions. Victor agreed to Tucker's deal but an unaware Sharon went to the SEC and told them of the shell corporations Tucker set up to secretly buy up Newman stock. Victor informed Sharon of his deal with Tucker and she rushed to his office only to find Tucker being arrested by the SEC and FBI as she apologized to Tucker as he was led away asking if Sharon was responsible for his arrest. He was eventually released after Sharon recanted her story to the SEC. Jill later tried to convince Katherine to forgive Tucker, which she eventually did. After they became on better terms, Tucker announced he was moving to Hong Kong, leaving Katherine devastated. Tucker and Katherine are reunited just before she passes away. According to Devon, Katherine's death hits Tucker a lot harder than he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit.</b> Tucker is so devastated that he cannot attend Katherine's funeral. Katherine leaves Tucker her record collection saying music was his first and true passion.|$|E

Troff's Nosherama was run by Mr Troff who was very arrogant, tight-fisted and didn't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> when he was wrong.

Very few of the little people of the Green Forest or the Green Meadows would willingly quarrel with him, for Little Joe is a great fighter when he has to fight. As for all those who live in or along the Laughing Brook or in the Smiling Pool, they let Little Joe have his own way in everything.|$|R

5000|$|The French Rococo was at {{its height}} in the 1730s and its {{influence}} {{can be seen in}} the painting despite Hogarth not visiting France until 1743. William Gaunt thought that Hogarth was more familiar with current French painting than he <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit.</b> The girl's aprons form serpentine S's, vertically in the oldest child, ending as it falls over her arm, and horizontally in the younger girl. A similar shape {{can be seen in the}} falling curtain on the right. The heads of the children and the cat create another noticeable S shape. The fruit bowl, a common subject in Rococo art, has been described as a [...] "bravura piece of still-life painting" [...] untypical of Hogarth's work.|$|R
60|$|We {{were all}} {{stunned by the}} dreadful news from England. It was very sad old Sir Francis, who had borne without {{complaint}} the loss of land, honours, and home, nay, who had stood by to see his only son die at Naseby, sitting like one crushed, and only able to mutter now and then: 'My Master, my good Master.' You might know an English exile in those days by the mourning scarf and sad countenance. I remember a poor wild cavalier whom my mother and Meg never <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> when Eustace was not at home, going {{down on his knees}} to Lady Ommaney for a bit of black silk, when {{he looked as if he}} was starving.|$|R
50|$|Though she and Sam will {{occasionally}} be rivals for Michael's attention, {{there is}} no real hostility between them anymore; and they now share a committed, if antagonistic, friendship. Though neither <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> it, they work well as a team, as Michael has pointed out. They have also demonstrated a willingness to risk life and limb for one another, as Fiona helped Michael rescue Sam from a vicious drug lord at the end of Season 1; and Sam likewise helped Michael save Fiona from O'Neill's clutches. Sam confessed that he felt sad when he thought Fiona would be returning to Ireland. The two of them will still trade barbs, though their verbal sparring now takes the form of playful teasing.|$|R

Giuliani pointed out that Dinkins had not filed a tax return for many years and of several other ethical missteps, in particular a stock transfer to his son. Dinkins filed several years of returns and said the tax matter had been fully paid off, denied other wrongdoing, and said that [...] "what we need is a mayor, not a prosecutor", and that Giuliani refused to say [...] "the R-word—he doesn't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> he's a Republican."

The addition of office hysteroscopy to vaginal sonography in the initial evaluation of abnormal uterine bleeding was associated with decrease number of visits with shorter duration to diagnosis [7].

5000|$|On 8 November 2013, Logan went on CBS This Morning to {{apologize}} for an inaccurate 60 Minutes report about the Benghazi attack, which had aired on 27 October. She indicated that an investigation uncovered {{that the source of}} much of her reporting was inaccurate and blamed it on Dylan Davies, manager of the local guard force at the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi. Logan said he lied about information but insisted they looked into his credibility and relied on such things as photographs and documents he supplied. In hindsight, Logan said they learned that the story told by Davies didn't match what he told federal investigators. [...] "You know {{the most important thing to}} every person at 60 Minutes is the truth," [...] she said in the on-air apology on the morning show. [...] "And today the truth is we made a mistake.

5000|$|Courtney Schulhoff was {{the first}} of the {{defendants}} to stand trial. Her trial began on September 26, 2006. Prosecutors alleged that although Michael Morin had committed the murder, Schulhoff had orchestrated it. She did not testify in her own defense at the trial. The next day, she was found guilty of first-degree murder. Because she was only 16 when the murder was committed, she was ineligible for the death penalty; on September 27, 2006, she was sentenced to life without parole. After the judge handed down the obligatory sentence, Courtney Schulhoff spoke out in open court, stating: [...] "Your Honor, I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> openly <b>admit</b> in court that Michael Morin is not the person who killed my father. I was. So, I accept full responsibility, and I accept the verdict." ...|$|R

But not very terribly, as far as one can make out: August and September being the danger months. The natives don't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> there is any malaria: a tiny bit, they say, a tiny bit. As soon as {{you come to the}} trees there is no more. So they say.

60|$|Jess halted to let {{the little}} {{procession}} go by, when suddenly she perceived John Niel among these men and recognised the Zulu Mouti on the box. There was the man whom she had just vowed never to see again, {{and the sight of}} him seemed to take all her strength out of her, so that she felt inclined to sink down upon the veldt. His sudden appearance was almost uncanny in the sharpness of its illustration of her impotence in the hands of Fate. She felt it then; all in an instant it seemed to be borne in upon her mind that she could not help herself, but was only the instrument {{in the hands of a}} superior power whose will she was fulfilling through the workings of her passion, and to whom her individual fate was a matter of little moment. It was inconclusive reasoning and perilous doctrine, but it must be allowed that the circumstances gave it a colour of truth. And, after all, the border-line between fatalism and free-will has never been quite authoritatively settled, even by St. Paul, so perhaps she was right. Mankind does not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> it, but it is, at the least, a question whether we can oppose our little wills against the forces of a universal law, or derange the details of an unvarying plan to suit the petty wants and hopes of individual mortality. Jess was a clever woman, but it would take a wiser head than hers to know where or when to draw that red line across the writings of our lives.|$|E
60|$|The {{element in}} that which really amuses an Englishman is {{precisely}} the element which, properly analysed, ought to make him admire an American. But {{my point is that}} only by going through the amusement can he reach the admiration. The amusement is in the vision of a tragic sacrifice for what is avowedly a rather trivial object. Mrs. Asquith is a candid lady of considerable humour; and I feel sure she does not regard the experience of hearing her read her diary as an ecstasy for which the sick should thus suffer martyrdom. She also is English; and had no other claim but to amuse Americans and possibly to be amused by them. This being so, it is rather as if somebody said, 'I have risked my life in fire and pestilence to find my way to the music hall,' or, 'I have fasted forty days in the wilderness sustained by the hope of seeing Totty Toddles do her new dance.' And there is something rather more subtle involved here. There is something in an Englishman which would make him feel faintly ashamed of saying that he had fasted to hear Totty Toddles, or risen from a sick-bed to hear Mrs. Asquith. He would feel that it was undignified to confess that he had wanted mere amusement so much; and perhaps that he had wanted anything so much. He would not like, so to speak, to be seen rushing down the street after Totty Toddles, or after Mrs. Asquith, or perhaps after anybody. But there is something in it distinct from a mere embarrassment at admitting enthusiasm. He might admit the enthusiasm if the object seemed to justify it; he might perfectly well be serious about a serious thing. But he cannot understand a person being proud of serious sacrifices for what is not a serious thing. He does not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that a little thing can excite him; that he can lose his breath in running, or lose his balance in reaching, after something that might be called silly.|$|E

On their first encounter Bonten tried to kill Ginshu, but found out that it was futile (as Ginshu revealed he was just a decoy for Shinshu). He was very fond of Ginshu, but unlike Ginshu, he did not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> openly <b>admit</b> it and often spoke to him rudely. He spent most of the winter as a child playing with Ginshu in various games. However, their relationship changed drastically after the priestess of the Sakigami shrine severely injured Tsuyukusa. A bloody battle took place, and as Ginshu and Byakuroku killed each other, a deal was made with Heaven, so that Shinshu's power was transferred to Bonten, and he replaced Byakuroku taking his place as Heaven's Seat.|$|R

In 1872 she organized the Women's Medical Association of New York City. Jacobi served as its president from 1874 to 1903.
