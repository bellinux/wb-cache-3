40|$|Mooring cable system, {{fastening}} {{the floating}} platform is an indispensable segment {{in the development}} and utilization of ocean energy. However, the nonlinear cable geometry and non- linear hydrodynamic forces perplex the construction of numer- ical modelling of mooring cable. Traditionally, the cable mod- elling is constructed just considering the geometry of cable, the normal, and the tangential directions. Not only the geometry of cable, but also the relative velocity of fluid is involved in constructing of the numerical modelling of cable in this paper. The expression of external loads by this numerical modelling is effective and accurate taking advantage of explicit separation of external loads in transverse and <b>lengthwise</b> <b>directions.</b> This modelling also simplified the formulation of hydrodynamic drag forces which is dominant among external loads. The stiffness and damping of cable, apparent weight, hydrodynamic drag forces, effect of added mass, and Froude-Krylov force are considered during building of this numerical modelling.

40|$|A slot with applied {{temperature}} stratification is considered when mean gravity is directed along its length and weak quasistatic jitter is {{applied in the}} spanwise direction, but {{when there is no}} component of gravity in the vertical. The behavior of the slot is governed by a number of factors: The sense of the mean gravity with respect to the applied stratification, the spanwise and lengthwise Rayleigh numbers, the Prandtl and Biot numbers, and the spanwise–lengthwise aspect ratio of the slot. A perturbation expansion of the governing equations is performed for weak spanwise jitter. At the first order of perturbation there is a circulation around the slot, producing an advected temperature field with spanwise gradients. At second order there are inflows or outflows in both the spanwise and <b>lengthwise</b> <b>directions,</b> along with a vertical redistribution of fluid. There is also a temperature field with lengthwise gradients, which typically competes with the applied temperature gradient. Equations are derived governing the vertical structure of all these fields and are solved in terms of a set of special basis functions. A parametric study is performed for the solutions. When lengthwise buoyancy forces are absent (the lengthwise Rayleigh number is zero), it is comparatively easy to deduce the required fields. However, finite lengthwise Rayleigh numbers couple the momentum and thermal equations thereby affecting the structure of the fields. Interesting behavior is predicted for small Biot numbers, when convected heat is effectively trapped in the slot: Infinitessimal flows can produce finite advected temperatures. The limits of small Biot number and small lengthwise Rayleigh number are found to be noninterchangeable. At large lengthwise Rayleigh number, boundary layers occur for stable applied stratification and layered cellular structures occur for unstable stratification. For the stable case at moderately small Biot number, the temperature jump across the boundary layer is small compared with the depth independent temperature in the bulk. Then by exploiting the boundary layer nature of the solutions, it becomes simple to predict the bulk fluid temperatures, interfacial heat fluxes and the circulations associated with the buoyant flows. Turning to the unstably stratified case, it is demonstrated that runaways can occur at first order in the spanwise jitter, and these correspond to resonant excitation of three-dimensional, stationary, long wave Rayleigh–Bénard modes. It is demonstrated how the Biot number and the spanwise–lengthwise aspect ratio of the slot influence the lengthwise Rayleigh number at which these resonances occur. There is in addition a set of two-dimensional Rayleigh–Bénard modes, which can potentially become excited at second order. When the Biot number and the spanwise–lengthwise aspect ratio are not too large, the Rayleigh numbers corresponding to the two sets of modes are nearly coincident. The second-order system will then be strongly forced near resonance, causing it to have a disproportionately large response...|$|R

50|$|The {{duration}} of the Helical Camshaft is changed by moving the outer shaft of the coaxial arrangement in a <b>lengthwise</b> (or axial) <b>direction.</b> The helix angle of the Helical Camshaft is probably {{always going to be}} around 30 to 35 degrees. The helix angle has its origin in the width of the segment used (normally about 10 mm) and the 20-degree region of constant radius on the nose of the lobe (this usually measures about 7 mm in circumference). The diagonal split line across this area thus must generally be at about 35 degrees to the axis of the camshaft. This translates to a figure of around 3.5 (crankshaft) degrees per millimetre of axial movement. 30 mm of movement would give 105 degrees of duration change. Although the Helical Camshaft is capable of far more than this, it has been found in testing that this amount is sufficient for most purposes.|$|R
40|$|When {{two or more}} {{individual}} materials {{combine to}} form a new material with improved characteristics, a composite is created. The two major components in a thermoplastic composite are the polymer, such as polypropylene (PP), and the filler, such as minerals like calcium carbonate and talc, or agricultural crop by-products like wheat straw, soy hull and soy stems. The main advantages of using agricultural fillers (AgFillers) in polypropylene are cost reduction and modulus improvement, without drastically increasing the specific gravity of the composite. These properties can be further enhanced by subjecting the composite to the bulk orientation process, in which the polymer chains align to give superior strength to the material, while the presence of polar AgFillers contributes to a reduction in material density. The objective of this research was to systematically study the relationships between the components and properties of AgFiller-PP composites, and their contributions to property modifications. Three types of AgFillers, wheat straw (WS), soy hulls (SH) and soy stems (SS) were studied, along with two PP types, virgin PP (vPP) and recycled PP (rPP), and mixtures of the two PP types. Non-oriented composites with a composition ratio of 40 wt% AgFiller to 60 wt% PP were tested for their morphology, chemical, thermal, rheological and mechanical properties. Similar properties of oriented composites with 20 wt% wheat straw filler and 80 wt% PP were also examined. The type of AgFiller was found to {{play a significant role in}} determining the rheological and mechanical properties of non-oriented AgFiller-PP composites. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that AgFillers had the tendancy to align lengthwise when subjected to the extrusion process. Depending on the fiber alignment within the filler with respect to the <b>lengthwise</b> <b>direction</b> of the filler, each AgFiller contributed differently to the composites’ properties. Stem-based AgFillers like WS and SS had fiber alignment parallel to the <b>lengthwise</b> <b>direction,</b> and the composites created had higher viscosity and higher flexural modulus. On the other hand, shell-based AgFillers like SH had fiber alignment perpendicular to the filler’s length, and were found to have less contribution to viscosity increase. Fourier transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy using attenuated total reflectance (ATR) technique showed that a skin layer of PP congregated on the surface of all the non-oriented AgFiller-PP composites, regardless of the AgFiller used. The main contribution of PP polymer type was to the rheological properties of non oriented AgFiller-PP composites. The presence of rPP also appeared to slightly improve the immiscibility between polar AgFillers and nonpolar PP polymer, according to SEM image analysis. The viscosity of the composites decreased linearly with increasing amount of rPP, because the rPP tested had significantly lower viscosity than the vPP chosen. No statistically significant conclusions could be drawn on the mechanical property changes due to large experimental variance that existed in the data. Bulk orientation of AgFiller-PP composites was shown to provide significant reduction in the material’s density as well as improvement in physical properties. Experimental results of oriented wheat straw-PP composites showed that wheat straw was highly comparable, perhaps even more superior, to wood fibers as filler for oriented PP composites. The ability to produce oriented wheat straw-PP composites using the same technology and conditions as producing oriented wood-plastic composites affirmed the feasibility for commercialization of oriented wheat straw-PP composites, and by means contributing to setting a milestone in the scientific research of AgFiller-thermoplastic biocomposites...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this study, cold {{reduction}} {{process of the}} tubular metal is applied to manufacture the drive shaft for the rear wheel drive system. With this method during forming process, chip forming such as hobbing and broaching method is not involved. The manufacturing process is as follows; the tube which the sheet is formed and welded to by roll forming machine, is mounted on a suitable mandrel. This mandrel has an external toothing which corresponds to internal toothing of the final product. During axial moving and rotating of the workpiece, forming operation is carried out in <b>lengthwise</b> <b>direction</b> of the toothing. This forming rolls is positioned on the roll head and have a rolling axis vertical with the one of a mandrel. The total forming load needed in the {{cold reduction}} process is separated into numerous forming steps along the entire cylindrical length of the zone to be formed. In the process of cold forming on the profiled mandrel during the impact forming operation, material is pushed into depression of toothing of a mandrel mainly in a radial direction. Finally splines can be generated {{on the surface of}} components and overall elongated. If the process parameter such as the length of forming per 1 rotation of 1 roll is not optimized, the impact force from the rolls of the forming process causes geometrical defects. So the optimal parameters such as feeding and rotating speed of workpiece and the forming length should be properly determined. And the effects of the weld line positioning on the formability of the forming process is analyzed to minimize the generation of the defects such as crack on the surface of splined zone...|$|E

Wetting was followed by 40 seconds of light curing with a conventional halogen curing light Optilux 501 ® d with a light intensity of 930 mW|cm 2 and a wavelength range of 400 - 505 nm Samples were SEM analyzed both in cross section and lengthwise. SEM observation revealed a <b>lengthwise</b> <b>direction</b> of cylindrically shaped fibers immersed in a metacrylate matrix in group A 1 and straight but woven fibers in group B 1. In both control groups voids ranging between 0 μm and 20 μm were visible between the fibers and groups of fibers.

In cross section views it is apparent that wetting with Heliobond for just 5 seconds was not sufficient for the adhesive to impregnate the fibers deeply. Groups A 3 and B 3 revealed a deeper penetration of Heliobond®; voids ranging between 5 μm and 15 μm could be observed only in the deepest portion of the fiber.

40|$|Magnonics is a {{young and}} {{evolving}} field {{with the potential to}} replace conventional electronics. This field relies on the use of spin waves, or magnons, rather than electrons as the information carrier in logic devices, which brings along advantageous features when it comes to device performance. However, to accurately control and manipulate magnons, periodically patterned magnetic materials are needed, conventionally obtained by top-down methods such as the deposition of a magnetic thin film followed by critical patterning steps, which are both time consuming and expensive. The bottom-up method of liquid-air interface self-assembly in a magnetic field was employed as a simplified method to successfully fabricate ordered one-dimensional magnonic structures, consisting of 12 nm magnetite nanocubes. This method offers great flexibility in terms of the direction and strength of an applied magnetic field, as well as the size, morphology and concentration of the nanoparticles involved. In addition, Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations utilizing the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, was performed to simulate and gain insight to the self-assembly mechanism. Two types of one-dimensional structures were considered, namely horizontal lines and vertically aligned rods. Volumetric solvent amount studies at fixed uniform magnetic fields, a uniform field study at fixed volume and an oleic acid surfactant concentration study was performed in the context of line-formation. Optimal magnetic field strength and total dispersion volume were established for narrow separated monolayered lines. Lines also seem to adapt a nanocube configuration corresponding to the [100]-direction parallel to the applied magnetic field for values below 750 G, and a [110]-configuration for values above 750 G, in excellent agreement with simulation results. Vertical gradient magnetic fields were investigated, resulting in superstructured rods. Experimentally, studies performed with varying magnetic field strengths and gradients, as well as concentration of nanocubes and dispersion volume, revealed that the level of one-dimensionality in terms of aspect ratio tend to increase with increasing magnetic fields, but did not seem to show any clear correlation to the value of the gradient. In addition, increasing both concentration and volume resulted in an increase of aspect ratio. A proposed magnetic field-induced self-assembly mechanism was established, in which a combination of translational and rotational Brownian motion, magnetic dipole-dipole interactions, magnetocrystalline anisotropy, as well as increasingly stronger van der Waals attractions with increasing oleic acid concentration upon evaporation, served to explain obtained ordered superstructures. Experiments supported by simulations demonstrate that the final stage of the process in pure oleic acid, is imperative for long range ordering, in which the final obtained structure is a compromise between van der Waals interactions and magnetic dipole-dipole interactions. Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) was utilized to magnetically characterize obtained magnonic structures. Second peaks presumably corresponding to low $k$ magnonic modes were observed for all samples considered, most probably with the applied field in the <b>lengthwise</b> <b>direction</b> in case of the one-dimensional structures. Shape anisotropy was well expressed in case of the one-dimensional structures...|$|E
40|$|Branches {{on trees}} {{introduce}} defects on sawn timber called knots. By scanning sawlogs using computed tomography, knots {{can be detected}} and accounted for so that the sawing process can be optimized with respect to outgoing product value. How the optimization should be done differs depending on available sawing equipment and the production strategy of the sawmill. It is important to investigate interesting production strategies with computer simulations to obtain an approximation of the profitability for a sawmill if investing in a computed tomography scanner. Another important step in the optimization process is to automatically segment knots {{so that they can}} be used by a computer when optimizing. This thesis presents an algorithm that automatically segments knots from computed tomography images of logs. The algorithm uses variable thresholds to segment knots on cylindrical shells of the computed tomography images. The knots are fitted to ellipses and matched between several cylindrical shells. The algorithm was tested on a variety of Scandinavian Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) with a knot detection rate of 88 - 94 % and generating about 1 % falsely detected knots. Knots are defects with high impact on boards that are graded with respect to their bending strength. Some sawmills specialize in the production of such boards and this thesis includes a simulation study of sawing Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) logs to optimize the outgoing board value for such a sawmill. The production strategy investigated in this thesis was scanning of sawlogs with computed tomography and optimizing the rotational positioning of the logs in the sawing process. This study showed a possible mean value increase of the sawn timber by 11 %. There are additional degrees of freedom in log breakdown than rotational positioning, such as log spatial position, skew and which sawing pattern to use. If every possible combination of sawing parameters would be simulated, enormous computational resources would be required. A study made in this thesis investigates the feasibility to use only parts of the knot information when optimizing log rotational position. This is done by projecting all knots to a plane perpendicular to the log <b>lengthwise</b> <b>direction</b> and filter out the least significant knots. The study showed a great challenge in this approach and the presented algorithm was insufficient in its present form to compete with alternatives that use full information of the knots.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of a cavitation bubble is greatly influenced by its surroundings. In an unbounded liquid a cavitation bubble grows and collapses spherically but a nearby solid boundary changes everything. Now the bubble collapses towards the wall and looses its spherical shape. During collapse a thin jet is formed piercing {{through the center of}} the bubble aimed towards the wall. Upon impacting on the boundary the jet spreads out radially exerting a strong shear stress on the wall. The shear strength drops with a - 11 = 4 power law. The strength of the jet depends strongly on the starting distance between the bubble and the wall. The jet impact velocity increases the closer the bubble gets to the wall up to a maximum for a standoff distance of about » 0. 6. For bubbles closer than that the jet velocity decreases. This jet flow can be utilized to temporarily porate the membranes of living cells; adherent cells are grown on the wall of a culture flask and exposed to a single cavitation bubble. As the jet impacts on the cell monolayer it detaches cells in a circular region around the point of impact. Surrounding the cleared area there is a ring where the shear stress was to weak to detach the cells but strong enough to rip small holes in the cell membrane. This permeabilization of the membrane can be detected by adding a dye to the liquid such that only the porated cells will be stained. Afterwards the cells are tracked for an entire day to make sure they survive the treatment. Interestingly enough when a bubble is created with a standoff distance smaller than ° = 0. 6 the amount of stained cells keeps increasing while the circular detachment area shrinks. The cause for this is the bubble growth on top off the surface which is also strong enough to porate cells. This finding can be used for instance in microfluidics. If a bubble is created in a thin liquid film between two parallel plates the bubble takes on a flat pancake like shape. This quasi 2 -dimensional bubble grows and collapses in a circular fashion and no jets are formed. But as was shown before bubble growth across a surface can also porate cells and by growing cells on one of the two walls in such a system this was also proven the case in microfluidics. Cells in suspension can also be porated but during bubble growth they take on a ”tear” shape which is expected to be a result of entraining the cell from the boundary layer into the main flow. A way to circumvent this instability we created a second bubble on the other side of the cell. The cell becomes compressed and simultaneously sheared yet it remains in place. Bubbles in confined geometries jet in the presence of a channel wall; even when a small channel opening is present. By positioning the bubble such that the jet does not impact on the wall but flows into the a channel opening realizes a pump. This idea which was put forward for larger millimeter sized bubbles by Khoo’s group (Khoo, et. al. 2005) has now been for the first time realized on the microscale for lab on a chip devices. Similar to the step from 3 D to 2 D the addition of second side wall close the first side wall takes us from 2 D to a quasi 1 -dimensional bubble. A bubble generated in such a long and thin channel only grows and collapses in the <b>lengthwise</b> <b>direction</b> of the channel. A one dimensional model does indeed describe the bubble dynamics quite accurately but only if the temperature inside the bubble is taken into account. This time another solid boundary will not induce jetting in the bubble. A free interface close to the jet however does result in a jet. It is however not a jet penetrating through the bubble but the result of the rapidly growing bubble pushing liquid out of the open end of the channel. We demonstrate on demand and reproducible jetting on the micrometer scale with more than 100 m/s...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to examine the compression-induced state of stress arising in {{castings}} of the guide grates during operation in pusher-type furnaces for heat treatment. The effect of grate compression is caused by its forced movement in the furnace. The introduction of flexible segments to the grate structure changes in a significant way the stress distribution, mainly by decreasing its value, and consequently considerably extends the lifetime of the grates. The stress distribution was examined in the grates with flexible segments arranged crosswise (normal to the direction of the grate compression) and <b>lengthwise</b> (following the <b>direction</b> of force). A regression equation was derived to describe the relationship between the stress level in a row of ribs in the grate and the number of flexible segments of a lengthwise orientation placed in this row. It was found that, regardless of the distribution of the flexible segments in a row, the stress values were similar in all the ribs included in this row, and in a given row of the ribs/flexible segments a similar state of stress prevailed, irrespective of the position of this row in the whole structure of the grate and of the number of the ribs/flexible segments introduced therein. Parts of the grate responsible for the stress transfer were indicated and also parts which play the role of an element bonding the structure...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{structures}} {{exposed to}} a fluctuating pressure field are excited best, if the pressure field contains characteristics that match the eigenmodes and wave speeds of the structural vibration. A pressure field can be caused either by acoustical sources, or a turbulent boundary layer, or both. The aim {{of this paper is}} the experimental determination of the excitation characteristic of the boundary layer and the corresponding vibration response of an underlying structure under like conditions. The motivation behind this is to obtain experimentally a joint model for the excitation and the related response of the vibration. Individual measurements of the vibration response of a generic aircraft panel exposed to the pressure field of a turbulent boundary layer have been conducted in the past. Individual characterization of a field of fluctuating pressure on a surface has been investigated as well. However, measurements of the excitation characteristics of the turbulent boundary layer of a generic aircraft panel at the same test setup are scarce. The excitation characteristics of the turbulent boundary layer have been measured individually in several speed ranges. A wavenumber decomposition is oftentimes used to display the features of the surface pressure. In the low-speed range, Arguillat^ 1 detected the convective propagation on a at plate in the wavenumber domain. Smith^ 2 used a generic setup of a at plate and a generic car side mirror in order to find turbulenceinduced acoustic waves propagating over the surface. These acoustic waves were believed to be responsible for a part of the excitation of the surface structure. In the high speed measurements by Ehrenfried & Koop^ 3 in the wind tunnel and Haxter & Spehr^ 4 in a flight test, the convective velocity of the turbulent structures in the boundary layer were considered to be the main cause for excitation of the surface structure. At high speeds, the modes of the structure match the convective speed of the turbulent vortices in the boundary layer, which is called aerodynamic coincidence. The vibration of airplane fuselage subject to excitation by a turbulent boundary layer has been measured by Wilby and Gloyna. ^ 5 In their measurement, accelerometers were placed in <b>lengthwise</b> and streamwise <b>direction</b> on panels, stringers, and frames of a Boeing model 737 aircraft. The distribution was carried out with large distances in between the sensors in order to find correlations in between adjacent panels and structure...|$|R
40|$|Dual-Phase (DP) steels, part of {{the group}} of Advanced High Strength Steels (AHSS), are used by car {{manufactures}} due to its large strength to weight ratio. The high strength of the DP steel does {{have a negative impact on}} the formability during sheet metal forming and stretch forming, e. g. fractures often appear in shear cut edges during forming of blanks made of DP steel.   The main objective with this thesis is to develop a new punch for Volvo Cars that concentrates the strain to the sheared edges of a test specimen made from different types of DP steel. This is done to be able to measure and obtain maximum fracture strain during stretch forming tests in a press. The newly developed test method is called CTEST (Concentrated Trim Edge Strain Test).   The tests are performed with DP steel specimens with three different qualities of the shear cut edges; fine cut, medium cut and worn cut. DP steels tested are DP 600 GI, DP 600 UC and DP 800 GI from three different suppliers. 10 different types of DP steels are tested in this study with different thickness. Thickness of specimens tested are 1 mm, 1. 1 mm, 1. 5 mm and 2 mm and all specimens tested have a <b>lengthwise</b> (RD) rolling <b>direction.</b>   The quality of the sheared cut edge has a great impact to the formability and maximum fracture strain of the specimen. A specimen with a fine cut endures higher fracture strain than medium cut and a worn cut for all types of DP steel with different thickness. A 1 mm thick specimen endures a lower fracture strain than 1. 5 mm and 2 mm specimen for all cut qualities.   Further, the impact of the orientation of the burr zone of a shear cut edge is studied. With the burr zone facing upwards from the CTEST punch the formability of the specimens is decreased compared to a burr zone facing downwards, especially for a worn cut specimen with micro cracks and imperfections in the edge surface.   ARAMIS Digital Image Correlation (DIC) system is used to analyze the specimen edges during press experiments. The ARAMIS results unveil that several small fractures appear in the sheared edges of a specimen just before the specimens split into two pieces. This phenomenon was seen for specimen with worn and medium shear cut qualities.   Finite Element (FE) simulations of the CTEST is performed in AutoForm to determine maximum values of the true strain for the three different cut qualities. The simulation in AutoForm does show a slightly higher value of the force and press depth than the value from the press test before maximum fracture strain in reached. The small fractures seen in ARAMIS just before the specimen split into two pieces cannot be seen in the simulation in AutoForm...|$|R
