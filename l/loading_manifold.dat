40|$|An {{extensive}} {{program to}} improve {{the operation of the}} Ames 16 Inch Shock Tunnel was carried out. This included reduction of driver slosh wave amplitudes and detonation risk by the use of premixed He/O 2 gas, longer wait times between the last gas load and driver gas ignition, an improved gas loading sequence, the use of four instead of one ignition wire, and the use of lower ignition wire voltages. Successful operation of the tunnel at pressures of 2000 - 6000 psi and enthalpies up to 12, 000 J/gm was achieved. A new diaphragm breaking technique, self break on the driver combustion pressure rise, was tested and found to produce clean breaks over the full pressure range of the tunnel. Improvements were made to the driver gas <b>loading</b> <b>manifold</b> and a preliminary design was made of a gas mixing system which mixes all three gases on the fly just before injection into the driver. Other improvements as well as tests are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- A similar {{historical}} {{load data}} search technique, which took {{the sum of}} meteorological load and secular trend load as clustering center, was put forward. This method can improve the similarity of the loads between forecast day and sample days, and so as to improve the reliability and precision of <b>load</b> forecast. <b>Manifold</b> <b>load</b> forecast methods assembled by optimal weight were also applied. Technical application manifest these techniques can represent the load character of different areas, types and weather sensitivities, so as to have robust adaptability, and then have higher precision even to those small, big amplitude of vibration and weather-sensitive load...|$|R

40|$|The {{complexities}} of designing piles for lateral <b>load</b> are <b>manifold.</b> Forces from wind act against overhead signs and high rise buildings and loads from waves and current frequently {{are critical to}} the design of offshore structures and bridges. Waterfront structures must support horizontal loads from the berthing of ships, retaining walls must withstand lateral earth pressures. Such structures are often founded on piles which may be steel pipes or reinforced-concrete columns. In navigating the {{complexities of}} lateral-load design, the book presents procedures for designing the piles and pile groups; a problem that only can be solved by accounting for the soil resistance as related to the lateral deflection of the pile. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Manifold {{learning}} has been effectively used in computer vision applications for dimensionality reduction that improves classification performance and reduces computational <b>load.</b> Grassmann <b>manifolds</b> are {{well suited for}} computer vision problems because they promote smooth surfaces where points are represented as subspaces. In this paper we propose Grassmannian Sparse Representations (GSR), a novel subspace learning algorithm that combines the benefits of Grassmann manifolds with sparse representations using least squares loss L 1 -norm minimization for optimal classification. We further introduce a new descriptor that we term Motion Depth Surface (MDS) and compare its classification performance against the traditional Motion History Image (MHI) descriptor. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GSR on computationally intensive 3 D action sequences from the Microsoft Research 3 D-Action and 3 D-Gesture datasets. 1...|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} dynamic {{buckling}} universal solutions of discrete nondissipative systems under step loading of infinite duration. Attention {{is focused on}} total potential energy functions associated with universal unfoldings of cuspoid type catastrophes with one active coordinate. The fold, dual cusp and tilted cusp catastrophes under statically applied loading occurring via limit points, asymmetric/symmetric bifurcations and nondegenerate hysteresis points are extended {{to the case of}} dynamic <b>loading.</b> Catastrophe <b>manifolds</b> of these types showing imperfection sensitivity under both types of loading are fully assessed. Important findings regarding dynamic buckling of imperfect systems generated by perfect systems associated with 'imperfect' bifurcations are explored. The analysis is supplemented by a numerical application of a system exhibiting imperfect bifurcation when it is perfect as well as a hysteresis point associated with a tilted cusp catastrophe, when it becomes imperfect...|$|R

The atomic, molecular or crystalline microstructure of the material can be incorporated in simulations that will yield accurate predictions, depending on the requirements to be met. The present and future challenges are to comprehend more soundly the response of materials to the <b>manifold</b> <b>loads</b> and environments they are subject to.

40|$|For {{the family}} of {{non-parametric}} q-exponential statistical models, in a former paper, written by the same authors, a differentiable Banach manifold modelled on Lebesgue spaces of real random variables has been built. In this paper, the geometry induced on this manifold is characterized by q-divergence functionals. This geometry {{turns out to be}} a generalization of the geometry given by Fisher information metric and Levi-Civita connections. Moreover, the classical Amari’s α-connections appears as special case of the q[*]−connections ∇[*](q).

40|$|The RC 2 - 75, {{a liquid}} cooled two chamber rotary {{combustion}} engine (Wankel type), designed for aircraft use, was tested and representative baseline (212 KW, 285 BHP) performance and emissions characteristics established. The testing included running fuel/air mixture control curves and varied ignition timing to permit selection of desirable and practical settings for running {{wide open throttle}} curves, propeller <b>load</b> curves, variable <b>manifold</b> pressure curves covering cruise conditions, and EPA cycle operating points. Performance and emissions data were recorded {{for all of the}} points run. In addition to the test data, information required to characterize the engine and evaluate its performance in aircraft use is provided over a range from one half to twice its present power. The exhaust emissions results are compared to the 1980 EPA requirements. Standard day take-off brake specific fuel consumption is 356 g/KW-HR (. 585 lb/BHP-HR) for the configuration tested...|$|R
40|$|The first damped detuned {{accelerator}} structure, DDS 1, {{has been}} built, {{tested in the}} ASSET experiment, and installed in the NLCTA. The planning and construction {{of a series of}} further structures, incorporating some modifications, is under way. DDS 2, 3, and 4 all incorporate the same basic design as DDS 1. The manifold design for the last 5 % of the downstream end of the structure has been modified to accommodate improvements in the <b>manifold</b> <b>loads.</b> Calculations based on the spectral function method indicate, on average, a factor two or better reduction in the long range wake. Modest modifications in the distribution of geometrical detuning parameters along the structure which, according to calculations based on spectral function theory, significantly improve the short range wake will be incorporated in DDS 3 and 4. The basic cell configuration will be redesigned in DDS 5 with the intention of improving shunt impedance as well as incorporating further improvements in the wake...|$|R
5000|$|The 3.6 was {{the first}} AJ6 engine, debuting in 1983 on the XJ-S. It had DOHC 4-valve heads with a 91 mm bore and 92 mm stroke. Power was [...] with 325 Nm of torque. Power was reduced to [...] for {{versions}} having catalytic exhaust system. Early versions of the 3.6L AJ6 as used in the 1984 - 1987 XJ-S cars had a conventional distributor type of ignition system with electronics within the distributor body. This early AJ6 ignition system is nearly identical to the system used on the XK engine in the Series III XJ6 cars. The Lucas fuel injection system on the 3.6L AJ6 engines in these early XJ-S cars sensed engine <b>load</b> using a <b>Manifold</b> Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor just like the V12 cars from the same era. Later 3.6L AJ6 engines as used in the 1986-1989 XJ40 cars had a crank-sensor type of ignition system with a bare distributor that only carried the spinning ignition rotor inside the distributor cap. The fuel-injection system used on the later 3.6L AJ6 engines used a hot-wire Mass Air Flow sensor to determine engine load.|$|R
40|$|Copyright c ○ 2004 SAE International Mean value {{cylinder}} {{air charge}} (CAC) estimation models for control and diagnosis are investigated on turbocharged SI-engines. Two topics are studied; Firstly CAC changes due to fuel enrichment and secondly CAC sensitivity to exhaust manifold pressure changes. The {{objective is to}} find a CAC model suitable for control and diagnosis. Measurements show that CAC models based on volumetric efficiency gives up to 10 % error during fuel enrichment. The error is caused by the cooling effect that the fuel has as it evaporates and thus increases the charge density. To better describe the CAC during fuel enrichment a simple one parameter model is proposed which reduces the CAC estimation error on experimental data from 10 % to 3 %. With active wastegate control, the pressure changes in the exhaust manifold influences the CAC. The magnitude of this influence is investigated using sensitivity analysis on an exhaust manifold pressure dependent CACmodel. From the sensitivity analysis it can be concluded, that the CAC is most sensitive to exhaust manifold pressure changes for low intake <b>manifold</b> pressures (part <b>load).</b> Without taking the exhaust manifold pressure into account the CAC error is approximately 5 % when the wastegate is opened at part <b>load.</b> The exhaust <b>manifold</b> pressure dependent CAC model is then augmented with the charge cooling model and the total model gives precise agreement on experimental data. The resulting model is thus highly suitable for CAC estimation for control and diagnosis of turbocharged SI-engines...|$|R
40|$|Large-bore piping inside {{manifold}} {{structures are}} designed to be flexible. The piping must absorb thermal and pressure loading, as well as installation tolerances, well growth and in some cases stroking and/or other temporarily imposed displacement-controlled conditions. In order for branch pipes, flex-loops or other jumper type configurations to cope with the functional, fabrication and installation loads they {{are designed to}} be highly flexible. Depending on well conditions and functional requirements the piping is commonly highly utilised statically. Vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) and wave-induced loading on the other hand are directly related to the Eigen-frequencies of the piping systems, and the more flexible a system is, the more prone it is to respond to cyclic loading induced by waves and current. In order to mitigate environmental loading effects, it is favourable to heighten the harmonic frequency of a system. Increasing the harmonic frequency is however done by making the system more rigid, which generally is undesirable for flexible large-bore piping systems in manifolds, since this in turn increases the level of static utilisation. There is to DNV’s knowledge currently no standard industry practice on VIV and environmental <b>loading</b> for large-bore <b>manifold</b> piping, since these normally are sufficiently rigid to prevent VIV. Recently, however, DNV has encountered systems where VIV and environmental loading have presented significant challenges for flexible large-bore systems, and this paper proposes a series of methodologies to estimate fatigue and extreme environmental loading of such systems. Advanced applications of DNV-RP-F 105 and DNV-RP-C 205 are detailed from recent project experience. 1...|$|R
