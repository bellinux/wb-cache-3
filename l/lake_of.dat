5|$|During some Christmases of {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, the Baby Jesus statue was often stolen from the outdoor nativity scene in Jönköping in Sweden, once thrown into the nearby <b>lake</b> <b>of</b> Vättern.

5|$|In Yucatan, Morgan confronts Sahin and the Ottomans {{searching for}} the Lake and destroys the Ottoman base. However the Spanish conquistador, Francisco Juan Delgado de Leon, captures Sahin and some other Ottoman {{soldiers}} before Morgan can. Morgan is then forced to fight and defeat the Spanish, who are attacking Morgan's new allies, the Aztecs. After his battle to defend the Aztecs, Morgan realizes that Delgado and the Spanish were after the map to the <b>Lake</b> <b>of</b> the Moon disguised as the mosaic in the Aztecs' town square. The mosaic shows the <b>Lake</b> <b>of</b> the Moon being in Florida.|$|E
5|$|In {{the earlier}} {{part of the}} 19th century the area which is today Minnesota was not {{recognized}} as a single entity. The Mississippi River had divided the eastern British/French lands of North America from the western Spanish lands and even after the Louisiana Purchase this was for a time seen as a separation between territories. The division between the U.S. territories {{in the region and}} the British territories remained ambiguous until the Anglo-American Convention of 1818, which set the border with British North America at the 49th parallel west of the <b>Lake</b> <b>of</b> the Woods (except for a small chunk of land now dubbed the Northwest Angle). Border disputes east of the <b>Lake</b> <b>of</b> the Woods continued until the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842.|$|E

5|$|A {{large stone}} {{windmill}} {{was built on}} a hill by late 1686, doubling as a watch tower over the Ottawa River, the <b>Lake</b> <b>of</b> Two Mountains and {{the mouth of the}} Des Prairies River. This windmill was like no other in New France (although a similar fortified windmill was later built in Quebec), with thick walls, square loopholes for muskets, with machicolation at the top for pouring lethally hot liquids and rocks onto attackers.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} a rival railroad {{company and}} laying track {{to supply the}} US Cavalry near the Mexican border, Amelia meets a French prospector named Pierre Beaumont, who helps her and US Cavalry commander, Major Cooper, defeat a Mexican army attacking a fort. He then lures Amelia to a mine in Colorado where a surprise visit from an aged Kanyenke, who has brought Cooper and the cavalry with him, reveals Beaumont {{as the leader of}} Circle of Ossus. Amelia, Kanyenke, and Cooper chase Beaumont through the mines, where they find a map to the <b>Lake</b> <b>of</b> the Moon.|$|E

25|$|An {{acid lake}} is a lake {{that has a}} pH is below neutral (<6.5). A lake is {{considered}} to and highly acid when the pH drops below 5.5, below which when biological consequences occur. Such lakes include acid pit lakes occupying abandoned mines and excavations; naturally acid <b>lakes</b> <b>of</b> igneous and metamorphic landscapes; peat bogs in northern regions; acid-saline <b>lakes</b> <b>of</b> arid environments; crater <b>lakes</b> <b>of</b> active and dormant volcanoes; and lakes acidified by acid rain.|$|R
5|$|An {{affluent}} 19th-century {{agricultural community}} {{of the same name}} established near the lakeside in the mid-19th century, but dwindled in status, becoming virtually abandoned {{in the aftermath of the}} American Civil War. It was strategically important during the early stages of the war, due to its proximity to fresh water and the Gulf of Mexico. After reaching its low point during the Great Depression, the lakeside community modestly rebounded in 1947 following the nearby discovery of oil. A fictional <b>lake</b> <b>of</b> the same name and with a similar history is featured in the 1998 novel Holes.|$|E

5|$|Dolbadarn Castle {{was built}} in either the 1220s or the 1230s by Llywelyn the Great, {{at the base of}} the Llanberis Pass, {{overlooking}} the <b>lake</b> <b>of</b> Llyn Padarn in North Wales. Traditionally the Welsh princes had not constructed castles, instead using undefended palaces called , or courts. From the late 11th century onwards, the Normans had advanced into Wales, taking lands in the north and establishing a band of occupied territory in the south called the Welsh Marches. During the 12th century some timber and earthwork castles began to be built, but in small numbers.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 18th and early 19th centuries, the area's legal and {{political}} status was disputed. The Treaty of Paris, which ended the American Revolutionary War in 1783, had defined the northern border between the United States and Canada based on the inaccurate Mitchell Map. Ownership of the area between <b>Lake</b> <b>of</b> the Woods and Lake Superior was unclear, with the United States claiming the border was further north at the Kaministiquia River and Canada claiming it was further south beginning at the Saint Louis River. In 1842, the Webster–Ashburton Treaty clarified {{the border between the}} United States and Canada using the old trading route running along the Pigeon River and Rainy River (today the BWCAW's northern border).|$|E
5|$|In 1906, Theodore Wirth came to Minneapolis as {{the parks}} superintendent. During his tenure, {{the park system}} {{increased}} from 1810 acres (7.3km²) in 57 properties to 5421 acres (21.9km²) in 144 properties. The park system, organized around the Minneapolis chain of lakes (including Cedar Lake, <b>Lake</b> <b>of</b> the Isles, Lake Calhoun, Lake Harriet, Lake Hiawatha, and Lake Nokomis) became a model for park planners around the world. He also encouraged active recreation in the parks, {{as opposed to just}} setting aside parks for passive admiration.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{the average}} annual daily traffic (AADT) surveys {{conducted}} by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) showed that 2,100vehicles used M-186. M-113 west of M-186 logged an average of 7,800vehicles a day north of the junction and 4,400vehicles south of the junction. On the east end, US131 carried 5,100vehicles north and 4,800vehicles south of the junction in Fife <b>Lake.</b> <b>Of</b> the 2,100vehicles on M-186, only 140trucks travelled the highway each day on average.|$|E

5|$|In July 1816, Mary Shelley and Percy Bysshe Shelley {{toured the}} Alps and visited Chamouni (as {{it was then}} known), {{as well as the}} Mer de Glace and the Bossons Glacier.

The book concludes with Mont Blanc, a 144-line poem by Percy Shelley, written whilst in Chamonix and which was inspired by the river Arve, the snow-covered summits, the chaotic glaciers and the forests that he experienced during their visit.|$|E
