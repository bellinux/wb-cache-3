50|$|The bridge can be {{supported}} on unprepared and uneven ground without grillages. It is constructed on one roller beam for single-story construction; two roller beams, 4.6 m apart, for double-story construction; and on three roller beams when constructing a double-story bridge over 12 bays long. The {{ends of the}} roller beams are supported on base plates and each can be adjusted in height. No leveling or other preparation of the ground is required. Single-span bridges are launched using a centrally mounted <b>launching</b> <b>nose.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{superstructure}} of {{the current}} bridge was assembled in three sections on the Waldshut bank in a temporary work hall. After completion of the first segment, it was rolled out of the hall. Then the second segment was built, and on its completion was connected with the first.

The actual installation of the bridge was carried with the support of piles in the Rhine, using of a 10.5 m wooden <b>launching</b> <b>nose,</b> propelled over a runway.

40|$|Abstract—The <b>launching</b> <b>nose</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the incremental launching construction. The parameters of the <b>launching</b> <b>nose</b> essentially affect the internal forces of the girder during the construction. The appropriate parameters can decrease the internal forces in the girder and save the material and reduce the cost. The simplified structural model, which is made with displacement method according to the characteristic of incremental launching construction and the variation rule of the internal forces, calculates and analyzes the effect of the length, the rigidity and weight of launch nose on the internal forces of girder during the incremental launching construction. The method, which can calculate the <b>launching</b> <b>nose</b> parameters for the optimum incremental launching construction, is achieved. This method is simple, reliable and easy for practical use. Keywords—incremental launching, <b>launching</b> <b>nose,</b> optimum analysis, displacement metho...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{structural}} {{behavior of}} incrementally launched bridges {{in the construction}} stages depends on different parameters. Internal force of main girder {{is influenced by the}} dead load and stiffness of main girder, the length and stiffness of <b>launching</b> <b>nose.</b> Parametric analysis on the effect of internal force of an 8 × 60 m-span concrete continuous box girder bridge was carried out. The results show that bending moment increases following the increase of weight and stiffness of corresponding segment of main girder. The phenomenon is even more obvious in the negative bending moment region of main girder segment nearby the <b>launching</b> <b>nose.</b> The bending moment of main girder reduces significantly when the stiffness ratio among <b>launching</b> <b>nose</b> and main girder is less than 0. 15. While, the negative bending moment of main girder reduces significantly when the length ratio among <b>launching</b> <b>nose</b> and main span is more than 0. 58...|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge deck}} {{was built in}} a {{temporary}} factory 20 metres south of {{the southern end of}} the bridge. Each section of the bridge was pushed with 600 tonnes of hydraulic force over PTFE bearings on the top of the bridge supports. The <b>launch</b> <b>nose</b> section had a light steel composition to reduce the cantilever moment as it was inched over an open span. Each deck section was constructed as around 21 metres in length - half a span. The concrete used welded mat reinforcement. The pre-stressing of each section had 38 Macalloy bar tendons of 40 mm thickness. The sections would be cast on a Monday morning and pushed on a Friday, this later being on a Thursday. Each deck section weighed around 14,000 tonnes.|$|R

40|$|This Thesis {{describes}} {{the technology of}} building bridges with the launching technique, and it includes different types of launching techniques and their working equipment. Launching of heavy superstructures is described in detail. In our case that {{was the type of}} superstructure with reinforced concrete which had a box cross section. The main goal of this Thesis was to check the suitability of the chosen <b>launching</b> <b>nose.</b> In the introduction there is a brief overview of the history of building bridges. It also presents the most common techniques of building bridges, and the differences between them. The second chapter {{describes the}} difference between construction techniques of bridges with a launching method for light and heavy superstructures. Since the Thesis concentrates mainly on heavy superstructures, the following chapter describes the choice of bearings for the launching phase and the service phase in more detail as well as the possiblity of using the <b>launching</b> <b>nose,</b> temporary piers and cable – stayed front system. The next chapter describes the necessary prestressing, where the superstructure is prestressed separately for the construction phase and the service phase. In the case of launching bridges the prestressing is essential, because during construction the superstructure has to withstand a lot of load, which would not be possible without prestressing. Loads on the superstructure are enormous even in the completed form, but still smaller than in the beginning phase. The final part of Thesis describes the testing of the impact that a choice of <b>launching</b> <b>nose</b> has on the loading, particularly on the viaduct Dobruša which was built in 2008 on the highway Vrba - Peračica. First, the size of loading was determined with a theoretical model which included only the effects of its own weight, and later the software package Sofistik was used. In the second case all the impacts that actually have influence on the viaduct Dobruša have been taken into account for determining the load limit. I...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{erection}} project of a composite girder bridge, {{by means of the}} incremental launching technique. After {{a detailed description of the}} main erection techniques regarding girder bridges (prestressed concrete, steel and composite bridges), the attention is focused on incremental launching, describing the most typical features and problems of this construction method, especially for composite bridges. Afterwards, a practical example is analysed, concerning a 310 m-long steel tub girder bridge, with a varying depth concrete slab, incrementally launched from one abutment towards the opposite one (consisting in the construction of deck segments behind the abutment alternating with the launch of the whole deck section), using a steel trussed <b>launching</b> <b>nose.</b> The optimization of the nose-deck interaction is carried out, and the calculation of stresses in the superstructure during launching is performed by means of a special spreadsheet developed for this purpose, based on the reduced transfer matrix method. Finally, strength and stability verifications of the superstructure are accomplished, using a linear buckling FEM analysis, and the patch loading problem is described and discussed...|$|E

60|$|They {{were still}} among the small {{shipping}} of Ryde. Siegmund and Helena, {{as they looked}} out, became aware of a small motor-launch heading across their course towards a yacht whose tall masts were drawn clean on the sky. The eager <b>launch,</b> its <b>nose</b> up as if to breathe, was racing over the swell like a coursing dog. A lady, in white, and a lad with dark head and white jersey were leaning in the bows; a gentleman was bending over some machinery {{in the middle of}} the boat, while the sailor in the low stern was also stooping forward attending to something. The steamer was sweeping onwards, huge above the water; the dog of a boat was coursing straight across her track. The lady saw the danger first. Stretching forward, she seized the arm of the lad and held him firm, making no sound, but watching the forward menace of the looming steamer.|$|R
50|$|The launch {{took place}} on March 4, 2011, at 2:09:43 am Pacific Standard Time (10:09:43 UTC) from Vandenberg Air Force Base. The Taurus XL rocket's first three stages functioned as planned, but the nose cone (also known as the payload fairing) failed to {{separate}} 2 minutes 58 seconds after the <b>launch.</b> The <b>nose</b> cone covers and protects the satellite during launch and ascent, and is designed to separate and fall away shortly after the launch. Due {{to the failure of}} the nose cone to separate, the rocket remained too heavy to reach the correct orbit. According to launch director Omar Baez, the satellite and launcher likely crashed in the southern Pacific Ocean. The failure was estimated to have cost at least $424 million. This only includes the cost of the satellite itself, and not the cost of the launcher and launch services. During the previous failed Taurus XL launch, the vehicle and services were estimated to have cost $54m.|$|R
50|$|While {{preparing}} {{to launch a}} tactical nuclear counter-assault, NATO authorizes a last-ditch conventional air campaign, Operation Bloody <b>Nose,</b> <b>launched</b> 24 hours before the nuclear strikes were to begin. It is an overwhelming success: the initial strikes cripple Warsaw Pact command and control posts, throwing their armies in the field into chaos, and in the ensuing air battle, NATO inflicts devastating losses on the Soviet Air Force (which had already lost 20% of the aircraft supporting the initial offensives including the Mig 21,23,25 and 29) ,gaining unchallenged control of Eastern European airspace. Combined with assistance from the Polish underground that cuts off Soviet supply lines, the tide of the war turns. With their numerical superiority negated by the Western technological superiority, the East German and Soviet armies melt under NATO airfire, and Western forces enter East Germany on March 23.|$|R
