5|$|Under Ahmose's reign, {{the city}} of Thebes became the capital {{for the whole of}} Egypt, as it had been under the 11th Dynasty in the early Middle Kingdom. It also became the center for a newly {{established}} professional civil service, where there was a greater demand for scribes and the literate as the royal archives began to fill with accounts and reports. Having Thebes as the capital was probably a strategic choice as it was located {{at the center of the}} country, the <b>logical</b> <b>conclusion</b> from having had to fight the Hyksos in the north as well as the Nubians to the south. Any future opposition at either border could be met easily.|$|E
5|$|On {{the grand}} {{strategic}} level Marlborough had a rare {{grasp of the}} broad issues involved, and was able {{from the start of}} the Spanish Succession war to see the conflict in its entirety. He was one of the few influences working towards genuine unity within the Grand Alliance, but the extension of the war aims to include the replacement of PhilipV as King of Spain was a fatal mistake. Marlborough stands accused – possibly for political and diplomatic reasons – of not pressing his private doubts about reinforcing failure. Spain proved a continuous drain of men and resources, and ultimately hampered his chances of complete success in Flanders, the war's main theatre. The Allies did come close to a complete victory on several occasions, but the increasingly severe conditions imposed upon LouisXIV forestalled an early end to hostilities. Although the Duke lost his political influence in the latter stages of the war he still possessed vast prestige abroad, yet his failure to communicate his innermost convictions to his allies or political masters means he must bear some responsibility for the continuance of the war beyond its <b>logical</b> <b>conclusion.</b>|$|E

25|$|Chomsky {{believes}} anarchism is {{a direct}} descendant of liberalism, perfecting the ideals of personal liberty and minimal government of the Enlightenment.

25|$|Wittgenstein argues, in {{his later}} work, that this account of private {{language}} is inconsistent. If {{the idea of a}} private language is inconsistent, then a <b>logical</b> <b>conclusion</b> would be that all language serves a social function. This would have profound implications for other areas of philosophical and psychological study. For example, if one cannot have a private language, it might not make any sense to talk of private experiences or of private mental states.|$|E

25|$|Another {{profound}} {{conclusion of}} the theory of special relativity—perhaps the most well known—was that energy and mass are not separate things but are, in fact, interchangeable. But this new relationship also carried with it new implications for the concept of inertia. The <b>logical</b> <b>conclusion</b> of special relativity was that if mass exhibits the principle of inertia, then inertia must also apply to energy. This theory, and subsequent experiments confirming some of its conclusions, have also served to radically expand the meaning of inertia to apply more widely and to include inertia of energy.|$|E
25|$|Another {{study has}} {{demonstrated}} that sensory rheobases were no different in patients from those in age-matched control subjects, whereas motor rheobases were significantly lower. Discovering that motor axons have both a lower rheobase and a longer strength-duration time constant in ALS has prompted the conclusion that motor neurons are abnormally excitable in ALS, with properties more like those of sensory neurons. Changes in the geometry of the nerve due to loss of axons within the peripheral nerve likely cause this shift in rheobase. A <b>logical</b> <b>conclusion</b> of the present data {{is that there is}} a greater persistent Na+ conductance at rest in motor axons of patients with ALS than normal.|$|E
25|$|The <b>logical</b> <b>conclusion</b> {{of these}} events was that the border was heavily militarized, {{involving}} the building of castles and reinforcements of troops in the areas surrounding the Trabancos River, with some castles being erected in the west, such as in Alaejos. Paradoxically, the wars increased {{the value of the}} region, {{and for the first time}} there began to appear documents recording the area in the files of the cathedrals of Zamora, Salamanca and Segovia including documents regarding: Siete Iglesias de Trabancos ("Seven Churches at Trabancos") in 1178, Alaejos (Falafeios) in 1167, and in 1180, Eván de Arriba, Eván de Abajo, Valdefuentes and Pedroso (which are now deserted villages), together with Nava del Rey in 1265, among others.|$|E

25|$|A fiduciary's duty {{must not}} {{conflict}} with another fiduciary duty. Conflicts between one fiduciary duty and another fiduciary duty arise most often when {{a lawyer or}} an agent, such as a real estate agent, represent more than one client, {{and the interests of}} those clients conflict. This would occur when a lawyer attempts to represent both the plaintiff and the defendant in the same matter, for example. The rule comes from the <b>logical</b> <b>conclusion</b> that a fiduciary cannot make the principal's interests a top priority if he has two principals and their interests are diametrically opposed; he must balance the interests, which is not acceptable to equity. Therefore, the conflict of duty and duty rule is really an extension of the conflict of interest and duty rules.|$|E
25|$|Between 1934 and 1938, Hahn, Meitner, and Strassmann found a {{great number}} of {{radioactive}} transmutation products, all of which they regarded as transuranic. At that time, the existence of actinides was not yet established, and uranium was wrongly believed to be a group 6 element similar to tungsten. It followed that first transuranic elements would be similar to group 7 to 10 elements, i.e. rhenium and platinoids. The Hahn group established the presence of multiple isotopes of at least four such elements, and (mistakenly) identified them as elements with atomic numbers 93 through 96. They were the first scientists to measure the half-life of 239U and to establish chemically that it was an isotope of uranium, but they were unable to continue this work to its <b>logical</b> <b>conclusion</b> and identify the decay product of 239U – namely, neptunium (the real element 93); this task was only completed by Edwin McMillan and Philip H. Abelson in 1940.|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} claimed {{that there are}} {{elements}} of the grammar which are not found in these language families. Frequently mentioned is Esperanto's agglutinative morphology based on invariant morphemes, and the subsequent lack of ablaut (internal inflection of its roots), which Zamenhof himself thought would prove alien to non-Indo-European language speakers. Ablaut {{is an element of}} all the source languages; an English example is song sing sang sung. However, the majority of words in all Indo-European languages inflect without ablaut, as cat, cats and walk, walked do in English. (This is the so-called strong–weak dichotomy.) Historically, many Indo-European languages have expanded the range of their 'weak' inflections, and Esperanto has merely taken this development closer to its <b>logical</b> <b>conclusion,</b> with the only remaining ablaut being frozen in a few sets of semantically related roots such as pli, plej, plu (more, most, further), tre, tro (very, too much), and in the verbal morphemes ‑as, ‑anta, ‑ata; ‑is, ‑inta, ‑ita; ‑os, ‑onta, ‑ota; and ‑us.|$|E

25|$|Socrates {{admits that}} Protagoras has given an {{excellent}} answer {{and that there}} is only one small thing to clarify which he is certain that the Sophist will do easily. He asks Protagoras as to whether the attributes that form virtue, such as bravery, kindness and wisdom are one or many things, like for example the parts of a golden object which are fused together or that of a face which form a whole while retaining their individual substance (329d). Protagoras answers the second but avoids engaging in dialogue and digresses into a rhetoric which does not answer the question sufficiently but still manages to arouse the excitement of their young public. Socrates complains that Protagoras is long-winded, like a gong that booms when you strike it and won't stop until you lay a hand on it. It is a typical moment of Socrates opposite a Sophist where the latter is using eloquent speech to hide arguments that might not stand logical scrutiny while the former is trying to use his notorious question/answer format that will lead to a <b>logical</b> <b>conclusion</b> in his favour. Protagoras begins to bristle at this and so Socrates supposes that their styles are opposite. He personally doesn't like long-winded speeches like the one Protagoras just delivered, because he is forgetful and cannot follow the train of thought (334d), and Protagoras does not like to be peppered with questions that seem to lead them off track. Socrates gets up to leave, grousing that companionable talk is one thing and public speaking another (336b). After the intervention of several of the listeners, the men agree to compromise their styles so the discussion can continue.|$|E

500|$|In 1906, the {{commissioning}} of [...] {{brought about}} the obsolescence of all existing battleships. Dreadnought, by scrapping the secondary battery, was able to carry ten [...] guns rather than four. She could fire eight heavy guns broadside, as opposed to four from a pre-dreadnought; and six guns ahead, as opposed to two. The move to an 'all-big-gun' design was a <b>logical</b> <b>conclusion</b> of the increasingly long engagement ranges and heavier secondary batteries of the last pre-dreadnoughts; Japan and the United States had designed ships with a similar armament before Dreadnought, but were unable to complete them before the British ship. It was felt {{that because of the}} longer distances at which battles could be fought, only the largest guns were effective in battle, and by mounting more 12-inch guns Dreadnought was two to three times more effective in combat than an existing battleship.|$|E
500|$|Distortion was {{at first}} {{produced}} by simply overloading the amplifier to induce clipping, resulting in a tone rich in harmonics and also in noise, and also producing dynamic range compression and therefore sustain (and sometimes destroying the amplifier). Dave Davies of The Kinks took this technique to its <b>logical</b> <b>conclusion</b> by feeding the output from a 60 watt guitar amplifier directly into the guitar input of a second amplifier. The popularity of these techniques quickly resulted {{in the development of}} electronic devices such as the fuzz box to produce similar but more controlled effects and in greater variety. Distortion devices also developed into vocal enhancers, effects units that electronically enhance a vocal performance, including adding air (noise or distortion, or both). [...] Guitar distortion is often accomplished through use of feedback, overdrive, fuzz, and distortion pedals. Distortion pedals produce a crunchier and grittier tone than an overdrive pedal.|$|E
