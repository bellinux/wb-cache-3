Lee highlighted {{the successes of}} the PAP government since the last election, especially in creating jobs, reducing unemployment, retraining workers, and investing in young people. He argued that the strategies were working and economy was striving, and that PAP had united the people under the threat of terrorism. He reminded viewers that Singapore would have great opportunities as well as major challenges ahead as Asia was rising, and the PAP would make Singapore a <b>land</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> for all people, and each person could find {{his or her own}} niche and excel. He said that the government would educate each Singaporean to be the best they can be.|$|E
25|$|In {{honor of}} Inauguration Day, Ronald Reagan, himself a {{longtime}} California resident and former Governor {{of the state}} from 1967–75, became the first president {{to participate in a}} Super Bowl coin toss ceremony. However, he did it from the White House via satellite. Pro Football Hall of Fame running back Hugh McElhenny, a former 49er, was on the field during the ceremony. The U.S. Air Force provided four T-37 aircraft from nearby Mather Air Force Base (Sacramento, CA) and its 455th Flying Training Squadron for the fly-over. At $255 per hour of flying time for each aircraft, this T-37 flyover ranks as the most economical in the history of Super Bowls. In addition, all the pilots were young officers symbolizing California as the <b>land</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> and youth.|$|E
25|$|In 1938, {{champion}} Joe Louis {{announced that}} he would face Schmeling for the title. The rematch became an instant international sensation. Many clamored impatiently for its happening, but others, afraid of international tensions and the possibility of Hitler taking over the championship, protested. The controversy and ballyhoo led to the event becoming the most anticipated boxing match since the rematch between Dempsey and Gene Tunney, or possibly earlier. Louis, with his poor, black roots was adopted by American fans as the symbol of America as a <b>land</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunity.</b> In contrast, Americans perceived Schmeling and his ties to Hitler as an obvious threat to those opportunities and ideals. When the German walked to the ring at Yankee Stadium on 22 June 1938, he did so under a hail of garbage thrown from the stands. Louis came out blazing in the first round and Schmeling tried to counter-punch as he had in the first bout, but to no avail. Driven into the ropes and battered with a fusillade of short, crisp blows from every angle, Schmeling turned his back to his opponent and clutched onto the ropes, letting out a scream that even years later, many spectators could recall vividly. Schmeling later said that he screamed because he had been hit with a blow to the kidneys. Schmeling's knees buckled under the punishment, and referee Arthur Donovan pushed Louis away, beginning a count on Schmeling. Schmeling reluctantly stepped away from the ropes, and Donovan allowed him to continue. A few punches later, Schmeling was knocked down again. From then on, he was helpless. He rose but fell moments later, and Donovan stopped the fight.|$|E

500|$|The third section, [...] "Fencing in the Movement", {{chronicles the}} {{escalation}} of security tactics to counter protesters. Klein finds that police have been removing the distinction between civil disobedience and violence and purposefully normalizing violence so it is the expected outcome, not a rare event. She matches the decline of civil liberties and freedom of speech {{with the rise of}} free speech zones, indiscriminate use of tear gas and pepper spray, plain clothes officers, surveillance, and pre-emptive arrests. The fourth section, [...] "Capitalizing on Terror", discusses opportunism that used the September 11 attacks to further political and economic objectives. In an editorial piece for the Los Angeles Times, Klein argues that the US has sold its image too well as the <b>land</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> and plenty and that rising anti-Americanism {{was the result of the}} US inability to share this.|$|E

Most immigrants were hired to be farm laborers on large plantations, whereas some become peddlers and sold goods to farmers.

Italians made a major impact specifically on the Mississippi Delta region, because of the farming culture they created by utilizing fertile soil in the <b>land</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunity.</b> Although they did get accustomed to the southern tradition, but in doing so they also preserved their rich Italian culture.|$|E
2500|$|In 1933, Arlosoroff and German Reich {{officials}} {{viewed the}} British Mandate of Palestine as a <b>land</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> for very different reasons.

In addition, a financial agreement with Zionist leaders for the transfer of the refugees would help bolster a German economy adversely affected by anti-Nazi boycotts. For Arlosoroff and other Zionists, however, the potential mass transfer of Germany's Jews along with their assets to Eretz Israel presented a historic opportunity to help guarantee the future establishment of a Jewish nation in Mandatory Palestine.|$|E

Riis organized his autobiography chronologically, but each chapter illustrates a broader theme that America is a <b>land</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> {{for those who are}} bold enough to take chances on their future. The autobiography is mostly straightforward, but Riis is not sure if his past should be told as a [...] "love story", [...] "if I am to tell the truth [...] [...] [...] I don’t see how it can be helped." [...] Although much of it is biographical, Riis also lays out his opinions about how immigrants like himself can succeed in the United States. Chapter 7 is distinct because Riis's wife, Elizabeth, describes her life in Denmark before she married Riis.|$|E

The portrayal of New York as a vibrant <b>land</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunity</b> was linked to the common phrase [...] "I Love New York". As with other entries, the New York Combat Revue was created by Hiroi as a fantastical defense against the ingrained darkness that exists within major cities. According to Akahori, while the game only spanned eight episodes, it had far more story content than the previous full-scale entry Sakura Wars 3. The scenario originally spanned eleven episodes, with the additional content featuring appearances by a reborn Tutankhamun as a villain and using a storyline involving Cleopatra. Due to what were described as [...] "unavoidable circumstances", these episodes were cut from the game, reducing the scenario to its current length. The subtitle was taken from Farewell, My Lovely, a crime novel by American writer Raymond Chandler.|$|E

However it is proceeding at a very slow rate in Australia.

This paper proposes such a needs-driven technology roadmap to prototype a business value-added framework for the Australian logistics industry to build RFID applications. Initially we investigate the key elements of the needs-driven technology roadmap. Next, we illustrate what the Australian logistics industry needs to do pro-actively to fully benefit from the proposed technology roadmap, given their particular logistics activities. Finally, we make some suggestions for the collective vision <b>of</b> the RFID <b>land</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunities</b> available in the Australian logistics industry...|$|R

2500|$|In Manchukuo, the Japanese were {{creating}} {{a brand new}} state that was in theory independent, which meant {{that there were no}} limits upon the sort of polices that the new state could carry out, and many university graduates in Japan, who despite being opposed to the social system that existed in Japan itself, went to work in Manchukuo, believing that they could carry out reforms there that might inspire similar reforms in Japan. This was especially the case since it was impossible to effect any reforms in Japan itself as the very act of thinking about [...] "altering the kokutai" [...] was a crime, which led many leftist Japanese university graduates to go work in Manchukuo, where they believed they could achieve the sort of social revolution that was impossible in Japan. By 1933, the Japanese state had essentially destroyed both the Japanese Socialist Party and the Japanese Communist Party via mass arrests and Tenkō with both parties reduced down to mere rumps, which caused many Japanese student leftists to draw the conclusion that change was impossible in Japan, but still possible in Manchukuo, where paradoxically the Kwantung Army was sponsoring the sort of policies that were unacceptable in Japan. Moreover, the Great Depression had made it very difficult for university graduates in Japan to find work, which made the prospect of a well-paying job in Manchukuo very attractive to otherwise underemployed Japanese university graduates. In Manchukuo, the Japanese state was creating an entire state anew, which meant that Manchukuo had a desperate need for university graduates to work in its newly founded civil service. In addition, the Pan-Asian rhetoric of Manchukuo and the prospect of Japan helping ordinary people in Manchuria greatly appealed to the idealistic youth of Japan. Young wrote about the young Japanese people who went to work in Manchukuo: [...] "The men, and in some cases, the women, who answered the call of this <b>land</b> <b>of</b> <b>opportunity,</b> brought with them tremendous drive and ambition. In their efforts to remake their own lives, they remade an empire. They invested it with their preoccupations of modernity and their dreams of an Utopian future. They pushed it to embrace an idealist rhetoric of social reform and justified itself in terms of Chinese nationalist aspiration. They turned it to architectural ostentation and the heady luxury of colonial consumption. They made it into a project of radical change, experimentation and possibility".|$|E
