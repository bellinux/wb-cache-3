5|$|As {{with most}} large cars of its time, the Tagora was a rear-wheel drive vehicle, with a <b>longitudinally</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>engine.</b> There were three engine choices, mated to four- and {{five-speed}} manual transmissions or an optional three-speed automatic {{in the case}} of the four-cylinder engines.|$|E
5|$|Offered with an inline-4 {{engine and}} bucket seats the Pinto's {{mechanical}} design was conventional, with unibody construction, a <b>longitudinally</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>engine</b> in front driving {{the rear wheels}} through either a manual or automatic transmission and live axle rear end. Suspension was by unequal-length control arms with front coil springs; the live rear axle was suspended on leaf springs. The {{rack and pinion steering}} had optional power assist, as did the brakes.|$|E
25|$|The 2,500 road-going {{examples}} sold (required for homologation purposes) were made, but {{demand for}} the car was so high that Ford kept producing them. Later models (1995 up) have a smaller turbo than the homologation versions and came with the whale-tail spoiler as an option. The Escort Cosworth ceased production in 1996, but it has already achieved classic status and has a huge following. However, the car wasn't mechanically an Escort, being based on the four-wheel drive Sierra floorpan and mechanicals, including its <b>longitudinally</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>engine,</b> and was merely clothed in body panels to resemble a Mark V.|$|E
5000|$|Audi {{announced}} [...] "Audi Quattro with Ultra Technology" [...] in February 2016, it is a {{front-wheel drive}} biased system {{for use on}} platforms with <b>longitudinally</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>engines,</b> and shares {{much in common with}} their Haldex based systems.|$|R
50|$|Motorcycle <b>engines</b> can be <b>mounted</b> transversely; {{with the}} {{crankshaft}} aligned {{perpendicular to the}} frame or longitudinally, with the crankshaft parallel to the frame. Motorcycles with transversely <b>mounted</b> <b>engines</b> are more suited to have chain or belt final-drive. Motorcycles with <b>longitudinally</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>engines</b> are more suited for shaft final-drive.|$|R
50|$|In {{front-wheel-drive}} {{cars with}} <b>longitudinally</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>engines,</b> most often {{the front of}} the engine will point towards{{the front of the}} car, but some manufacturers (Saab,Citroën, Renault) have at times placed the engine 'backwards', with #1 towards the firewall. One notable car with this layout is the Citroën Traction Avant. This layout is uncommon today.|$|R

50|$|In {{contrast}} to the 'classic' Saab 900 with its <b>longitudinally</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>engine</b> and front-hinged hood (bonnet), the NG900 had a more-common transversely mounted engine with rear-hinged hood (bonnet).|$|E
50|$|As {{with most}} large cars of its time, the Tagora was a rear-wheel drive vehicle, with a <b>longitudinally</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>engine.</b> There were three engine choices, mated to four- and {{five-speed}} manual transmissions or an optional three-speed automatic {{in the case}} of the four-cylinder engines.|$|E
25|$|This Toronado, {{along with}} its Riviera and Eldorado cousins, were the last body-on-frame, front wheel drive cars with <b>longitudinally</b> <b>mounted</b> V8 <b>engines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Unusually, the Renault 21 {{was offered}} with {{disparate}} engine configurations. The 1.7 litre version featured a Transverse engine, but Renault had no gearbox {{suitable for a}} more powerful transverse engine: accordingly, faster versions featured <b>longitudinally</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>engines.</b> The two versions featured (barely perceptibly) different wheel bases: the engines were all relatively compact four cylinder units and the engine bay was large enough to accept either configuration without reducing passenger space.|$|R
25|$|Moto-Guzzi V50 with a <b>longitudinally</b> <b>mounted</b> 90° V-twin <b>engine</b> (500), {{not used}} anymore.|$|R
50|$|The vast {{majority}} of rear-wheel-drive vehicles use a <b>longitudinally</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>engine</b> {{in the front of}} the vehicle, driving the rear wheels via a driveshaft linked via a differential between the rear axles. Some FR layout vehicles place the gearbox at the rear, though most attach it to the engine at the front.|$|E
50|$|Aside {{from using}} the Matra V12 rather than the usual Ford Cosworth unit, the JS7 was a very {{conventional}} design with a Hewland six-speed transmission and a <b>longitudinally</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>engine</b> and wishbone suspension. The JS7 forewent the giant air intake of the preceding JS5. The front wing design echoed that of the Ferrari 312T.|$|E
50|$|The W196 was front mid-engined, {{with its}} long <b>longitudinally</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>engine</b> placed {{just behind the}} front axles instead of over them to better balance front/rear weight distribution. A welded {{aluminum}} tube spaceframe chassis carried ultra-light Elektron magnesium-alloy bodywork (having a specific gravity of 1.8, {{less than a quarter}} of iron's 7.8), which contributed substantially to keeping dry weight down.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>longitudinally</b> <b>mounted</b> rotary <b>engine</b> had {{a nominal}} {{capacity}} of 995 cc delivering [...] According to factory figures {{the car had}} a performance roughly on a level {{with that of a}} Morris 1300. The engine was supplied by a company formed in 1967 by NSU and Citroën called Comotor.|$|R
50|$|The 3.5RL's <b>longitudinally</b> <b>mounted</b> V6 <b>engine</b> had its center-line mounted in-line {{with the}} car's axis, and not {{transversely}} (i.e., 90 degrees offset from the vehicle axis) {{like most other}} front-wheel-drive cars. This longitudinal placement allowed for a smaller turning radius and easy in-town maneuverability, as well as 56/44 front/rear weight distribution.|$|R
50|$|The car was rear-wheel drive, with <b>longitudinally</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>engines,</b> canted over {{to bring}} a lower bonnet line to the styling. Manual or Automatic {{transmission}} was offered. The suspension system consisted of MacPherson struts and coil springs at the front and with either semi-trailing arms with coil springs or coil springs and live axle at the rear. The station wagon and most of non European versions used an unusual torque tube layout with huge suspension travel, and great strength, meant that the 504 was suited to rough road conditions, and the car proved extremely reliable in conditions found in Africa, Asia, Australia and the like. Pickup versions were available with a live axle.|$|R
50|$|The 300 SLR was front mid-engined, {{with its}} long <b>longitudinally</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>engine</b> placed {{just behind the}} front axles instead of over them to better balance front/rear weight distribution. A welded {{aluminum}} tube spaceframe chassis carried ultra-light Elektron magnesium-alloy bodywork (having a specific gravity of 1.8, {{less than a quarter}} of iron's 7.8), which contributed substantially to keeping dry weight to a remarkably low 880 kg.|$|E
50|$|Offered with an inline-4 {{engine and}} bucket seats the Pinto's {{mechanical}} design was conventional, with unibody construction, a <b>longitudinally</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>engine</b> in front driving {{the rear wheels}} through either a manual or automatic transmission and live axle rear end. Suspension was by unequal-length control arms with front coil springs; the live rear axle was suspended on leaf springs. The {{rack and pinion steering}} had optional power assist, as did the brakes.|$|E
50|$|Like the Biturbos, the Ghibli had unibody steel construction, with a {{conventional}} layout of <b>longitudinally</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>engine,</b> rear-wheel drive. Suspension {{was of the}} MacPherson strut type at the front and semi-trailing arms at the rear, with coil springs, double-acting dampers and anti-roll bars on both axles. The differential and rear suspension arms were supported by a bushing-insulated subframe. Brakes were vented discs on all four wheels, and steering was servo-assisted rack and pinion.|$|E
50|$|Maintenance: The {{location}} of the camshaft in the cylinder block often necessitates removal of the engine whenever camshaft work is required. This is particularly true for front wheel drive applications with a transversely <b>mounted</b> <b>engine.</b> <b>Longitudinally</b> <b>mounted</b> OHV <b>engines</b> suffer less from this problem as the camshaft can be withdrawn {{from the front of}} the engine after removal of the radiator. Additionally, replacement of lifters generally requires removal of the cylinder heads.|$|R
50|$|The Scania K-series is {{a series}} of chassis in Scania's city bus and coach range with <b>longitudinally,</b> straight-up <b>mounted</b> <b>engine</b> at the rear, {{replacing}} the K- (K94, K114, K124) and L-type (L94) chassis of the 4-series. The K-series was first presented on Busworld 2005 in Kortrijk, Belgium and models were available from 2006.|$|R
5000|$|Cost: Fewer {{material}} {{components and}} less installation complexity overall. However, the considerable MSRP differential between a FF and FR car cannot {{be attributed to}} layout alone. The difference is more probably explained by production volumes as most rear-wheel cars are usually in the sports/performance/luxury categories (which {{tend to be more}} upscale and/or have more powerful engines), while the FF configuration is typically in mass-produced mainstream cars. Few modern [...] "family" [...] cars have rear-wheel drive as of 2009, so a direct cost comparison is not necessarily possible. A contrast could be somewhat drawn between the Audi A4 FrontTrak (which has an FF layout and front-wheel drive) and a rear-wheel-drive BMW 3-Series (which is FR), both which are in the compact executive car classification and use <b>longitudinally</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The car {{was based}} on a brand new {{platform}} with a <b>longitudinally</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>engine</b> connected to a bespoke gearbox created by Graziano. The double wishbone suspension is a development of the system mounted on the M400. Mounting the engine longitudinally allowed the designer to increase cooling flow to the engine which allows the 3.0L twin turbo V6 to produce [...] The engine was designed to meet emissions regulations and the new steel/aluminium space frame was designed with a view to passing crash test regulations around the world. The M15 was planned to be the first Noble to gain European and US Type Approval.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{designed}} as a transverse mounted FWD-only power-plant being the second engine/gearbox combination to exhibit the now standard transverse engine-next-to-gearbox layout with unequal length driveshafts (the first was the Autobianchi Primula, the Mini had its gearbox in the sump of the engine). The exception to the engines FWD-only design is its revolutionary use as a mid-engine drive-train in the Fiat X1/9. Also Tofaş has adapted 128 engines into its Fiat 131 based <b>longitudinally</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>engine</b> with rear wheel drive layout platform. Unusual for the time was the electrically driven fan, rather than it being powered directly by the engine. The 128 engine has five crankshaft bearings.|$|E
50|$|When <b>mounted</b> <b>longitudinally</b> in a vehicle, flat engines {{with up to}} six {{cylinders}} are short, low, and wide. As a result, {{they have}} often been used in compact drivetrains where the <b>engine</b> is <b>mounted</b> outside the wheelbase and drives the nearer pair of wheels through the transmission without a drive shaft. The short length of a <b>longitudinally</b> <b>mounted</b> flat <b>engine</b> with six cylinders or fewer makes it ideally suitable for air cooling.|$|R
5000|$|Toyota Motor Corporation's M {{family of}} <b>engines</b> were a <b>longitudinally</b> <b>mounted</b> straight-6 <b>engine</b> design. They were used from the 1960s through the 1990s. All M family engines were OHC designs. While the M family {{was born with}} a {{chain-driven}} single camshaft it evolved into a belt drive DOHC system after 1980. All M family engines used a cast-iron block with an aluminum cylinder head, and were built at the Toyota Kamigo plant in Toyota City, Japan.|$|R
50|$|Toyota Motor Corporation's V {{family of}} <b>engines</b> were a <b>longitudinally</b> <b>mounted</b> V8 <b>engine</b> design. They were used from the 1960s through the 1990s. The V family engine {{was used in}} the prestigious Toyota Century. Toyota had worked with Yamaha to produce the first Japanese full {{aluminum}} alloy block engine. The V Family {{is often referred to as}} the Toyota HEMI as the engine features a similar cylinder head design to those found on the Chrysler's Hemi, even though most of the engine design is completely different.|$|R

5000|$|After the 2012 season, {{the vehicle}} was renamed RS5 DTM, {{correspond}} with the Audi RS5 production model. It {{is powered by}} a naturally-aspirated engine and 2xDOHC camshafts. The engine itself is a custom-built Audi 4.0 L V8 with four valves per cylinder and a 90 degree V-angle. It has a power output of approximately [...] and torque of 500 Nm. Front engined and <b>longitudinally</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>engine</b> mounting layout, the RS5's engine is indirect fuel injected. The RS5 DTM's ECU is a Bosch Motronic MS 5.1 and other components such as the CDI ignition are also supplied by Bosch. Audi RS5 DTM's first debut during DTM preseason test at Circuit de Catalunya on March 26-28, 2013 by all Audi teams and drivers.|$|E
5000|$|The Saab 96 had a <b>longitudinally</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>engine</b> layout. As first designed, {{it had a}} 841 cc, 38 hp (28 kW) three-cylinder Saab {{two-stroke}} engine. By 1965 {{this was}} increased to [...] An optional [...] version of the engine, with triple carburetors and oil injection, {{was used in the}} Sport and Monte Carlo models.

A common throttle shaft minimized carburetor synchronization problems.|$|E
25|$|LeSabres were {{rear-drive}} six-passenger vehicles from 1959 to 1985 (station wagons through 1990) featuring separate body-on-frame construction {{along with}} a <b>longitudinally</b> <b>mounted</b> front <b>engine.</b> The first downsized generation of LeSabres introduced in 1977 retained the rear-drive and body-on-frame construction, while the later-generation models introduced in 1986 switched to front-wheel-drive, unit-body construction and transversely <b>mounted</b> <b>engine.</b> Convertibles were offered each year through 1975 while two- and four-door hardtops were dropped after 1976 and only pillared body styles were offered from 1977 to 2005. Station wagons were offered through 1964 and then dropped for several years until being reintroduced in 1970 and continued until 1990 after which year they were moved to the revived Roadmaster series. LeSabres come in two versions: Custom and Limited.|$|R
50|$|Symmetrical All Wheel Drive (also {{known as}} Symmetrical AWD or SAWD) is a {{full-time}} four wheel drive system developed by Japanese automobile manufacturer Subaru. The SAWD system consists of a <b>longitudinally</b> <b>mounted</b> boxer <b>engine</b> coupled to a symmetrical drivetrain with equal length half-axles. The combination of the symmetrical layout with a flat engine and transmission balanced over the front axle provides optimum weight distribution with a low center of gravity, improving car handling characteristics. Since 1996, most international market Subaru vehicles include SAWD as standard equipment, with the rear wheel drive BRZ and kei cars as the exceptions.|$|R
50|$|Piëch held a small {{engineering}} {{company in the}} time between leaving Porsche AG and joining Audi, and while there, he developed a 5 cylinder in-line diesel engine for Mercedes-Benz. He picked up the concept again after moving to Audi, {{because there was a}} market demand for engines with more than 4 cylinders. At the time, Audi (and the Audi-derived VW Passat/Santana model range) used <b>longitudinally</b> <b>mounted</b> inline <b>engines</b> and front wheel drive. More conservative layouts with 6 cylinders were rejected because of engineering and production costs (V6 engine) or packaging requirements (straight 6 did not fit because front wheel drive required that it be mounted in front of the axis).|$|R
