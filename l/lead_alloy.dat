5|$|Lead's high density, atomic number, and {{formability}} {{form the}} basis for use of lead as a barrier that absorbs sound, vibration, and radiation. Lead has no natural resonance frequencies; as a result, sheet-lead is used as a sound deadening layer in the walls, floors, and ceilings of sound studios. Organ pipes are often made from a <b>lead</b> <b>alloy,</b> mixed with various amounts of tin to control the tone of each pipe. Lead is an established shielding material from radiation in nuclear science and in X-ray rooms due to its denseness and high attenuation coefficient. Molten lead {{has been used as a}} coolant for lead-cooled fast reactors.|$|E
5|$|The heavier {{metalloids}} {{continue the}} theme. Arsenic can form alloys with metals, including platinum and copper; {{it is also}} added to copper and its alloys to improve corrosion resistance and appears to confer the same benefit when added to magnesium. Antimony is well known as an alloy-former, including with the coinage metals. Its alloys include pewter (a tin alloy with up to 20% antimony) and type metal (a <b>lead</b> <b>alloy</b> with up to 25% antimony). Tellurium readily alloys with iron, as ferrotellurium (50–58% tellurium), and with copper, {{in the form of}} copper tellurium (40–50% tellurium). Ferrotellurium is used as a stabilizer for carbon in steel casting. Of the non-metallic elements less often recognised as metalloids, selenium—in the form of ferroselenium (50–58% selenium)—is used to improve the machinability of stainless steels.|$|E
50|$|Match pellets {{are made}} of soft lead (a <b>lead</b> <b>alloy</b> with low {{antimony}} content). The antimony content is used to control the hardness of the soft <b>lead</b> <b>alloy.</b> It is a very soft alloy, which {{makes it easy to}} process. Since the soft <b>lead</b> <b>alloy</b> is prone to strongly deform when striking a bullet catcher, it rapidly loses its kinetic energy and will not easily bounce off. Lead is toxic and hazardous to the environment, so that when shooting with lead pellets precautions should be taken.|$|E

The present study explores the time dependence on corrosion mechanisms of <b>lead</b> <b>alloys</b> anode oxidised in Cr-F solution under conditions of high current density.

50|$|Although some bullet casting {{procedures}} can {{be accomplished}} with heating elements used for cooking; {{care must be taken}} to avoid contaminating food preparation areas and/or utensils with <b>lead</b> <b>alloys.</b> Most bullet casters prefer to use portable electric melting pots in areas with good ventilation. Molten metal can cause serious burns; and molten metal can be sprayed around the working area by violently expanding steam if it comes in contact with water from spilled drinks or other sources. Bullet casters should wear protective clothing including eye protection, and should carefully wash hands prior to eating, drinking, or smoking. Young children are especially vulnerable to lead poisoning and are unlikely to appreciate the danger of shiny molten metal and newly cast bullets. Bullet casting must be limited to times and locations when children are absent.Particular risk comes from the oxides of lead and other metals present in <b>lead</b> <b>alloys,</b> as oxides are often more easily absorbed than the metallic forms. This means that the dross that is skimmed from the lead pot may pose a larger hazard than the metallic alloys.|$|R
