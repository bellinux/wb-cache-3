40|$|Abstract—Recent {{experiments}} have demonstrated synchroniza-tion of fiber <b>laser</b> <b>arrays</b> at low and moderate pump levels. It {{has been suggested}} that a key dynamical process leading to synchro-nized behavior is the differential phase shift induced by the gain media.

We find that its presence can substantially enhance the degree of inphase stability to an extent that could be practically important. At the same time, our analysis shows that a gain-dependent phase shift is not a necessary ingredient in the dynamical selection of the inphase state, thus, leading us to re-consider the essential mechanism behind inphase selection in fiber <b>laser</b> <b>arrays.</b> Index Terms—Coupled oscillator systems, dynamics, <b>laser</b> <b>arrays,</b> phase-locked oscillators, phase synchronization, synchronization.

50|$|Asteroid laser {{ablation}} is a proposed method for deflecting asteroids, involving {{the use of}} a <b>laser</b> <b>array</b> to alter the orbit of an asteroid. Laser Ablation works by heating up a substance enough to allow gaseous material to eject, either through sublimation (solid to gas) or vaporization (liquid to gas). For most asteroids this process occurs between temperatures in the range of 2700-3000 Kelvin. The ejecting material creates a thrust, which {{over an extended period of}} time can change the trajectory of the asteroid. As a proof of concept on a small scale, Travis Brashears, a researcher at UC Santa Barbara's Experimental Cosmology Lab, led by Dr. Philip Lubin, has already experimentally verified that {{laser ablation}} can de-spin and spin-up an asteroid.

50|$|Experience {{building}} and testing the first prototype identified {{a number of}} key issues. The scanner technology chosen provided great depth of field (useful for identifying surface features), but required a large volume for the mirror assembly (which had to be strengthened to withstand vibrations). Furthermore, the armour, support flanges, and water pipes limited further sediment penetration and caused sediment disturbance. It was desirable to move the entire water gallery into the centre of the scanner module so that penetrator heads could be rapidly changed in the field. It was likely that different shapes would be more effective in different sediment textures and fabrics. These decisions led to an alternate scanner technology that had been developed and marketed mostly in the early 2000s. It is known by various names such as contact imaging, direct imaging, or LED indirect exposure (US Patent 5499112). In this technology, a string of LEDs strobe the primary colours onto an imaging plane. Illumination is crucial so the imaging plane must be close. Reflected light from the imaging plane is directed into an array of light guides which lead to CCD elements. The physical arrangement between the light guides and the imaging plane is what limits the depth of field using this technology. Tests using consumer scanners indicated that the imaging plane could be 1-3 mm away from the scan head for full resolution images, but dropped off quickly beyond that. Scene features 5 mm or more away from the scan head were almost unidentifiable. Since the primary value of SP imagery is two-dimensional, this limitation was a small trade off for the great savings in space. The solid-state technology is robust to vibration and no mirrors are necessary. Unfortunately, UV illumination was difficult to provide without a custom-designed scan head and was therefore not included in the second prototype.One major advantage of SPI is that it reliably provides sediment information regardless of water clarity. However, many SPI applications such as habitat mapping and side-scan sonar ground-truthing, would benefit from imagery of the seabed’s surface when visibility permits. Since the tether provided a source of power and computer connectivity with the surface vessel, adding a digital camera to image the seabed surface immediately adjacent to the sediment profile was another conceptually simple addition. A <b>laser</b> <b>array</b> surrounding the camera provided a means to correct the geometry of the seabed surface image (since it is captured at a variable angle) and its scale. Such imagery provides a larger reference frame in which to interpret the adjacent sediment profile and permits a more informed estimation of the habitat connectivity of multiple profiles. A longitudinal section of the second prototype with the seabed surface camera is presented in Figure 11. The typical deployment configuration is shown in Figure 12.|$|E
