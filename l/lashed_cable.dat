50|$|Optical {{attached}} cable (OPAC) {{is a type}} of {{fibre optic}} cable that is installed by being attached to a host conductor along overhead power lines. The attachment system varies and can include wrapping, lashing or clipping the fibre optic cable to the host. Installation is typically performed using a specialised piece of equipment that travels along the host conductor from pole to pole or tower to tower, wrapping, clipping or lashing the fibre optic cable in place. Different manufacturers have different systems and the installation equipment, cable designs and hardware are not interchangeable.Although <b>lashed</b> <b>cable</b> systems and clipped cable systems have been investigated as a means of attaching optical fibre cables to overhead power lines, wrapped cables were the first type to be developed and are the only type in common use today.|$|E

50|$|Early {{manoeuvres}} {{during the}} winter months, running the fort and executing the 9.2 inch guns were a problem. Installed by cranes during construction, one of the 28-ton guns accidentally broke away from its <b>lashed</b> <b>cables</b> and smashed through the vast concrete apron that had been poured over frozen ground, sinking three metres (nine feet) into the thawed earth. Leaks in the subsurface was a nuisance, {{the complexity of the}} hydraulic system design had flaws and mechanical failures under the earths surface would occur. Although the hydraulic fluid was a cheap economy brand, when time came to charge the system and fire the guns off for a crowd of engineers and invited dignitaries, many of the welds failed and 6800 litres (1500 gallons) of crude hydraulic oil flooded & drenched the interior of the battery.|$|R
5000|$|On June 6th, 2017 Klein Tools {{announced}} {{the acquisition of}} the General Machine Products Company business based in Trevose, Pennsylvania. Klein Tools acquired substantially all of the business assets of GMP. GMP, a third-generation business {{owned and operated by}} the Pfundt family since 1936, is recognized as a premier worldwide supplier of specialty cable placement tools and equipment. The company is primarily known for its premium quality <b>cable</b> <b>lashing</b> machines, <b>cable</b> blowing equipment and other specially designed tools for the utility, data and telecommunications markets. GMP also has a subsidiary and facility in the United Kingdom, CBS Products, that was also acquired as part of the transaction.|$|R

5000|$|The lacing {{begins and}} ends with a {{whipping}} or other knot to secure the free ends. Wraps are spaced relative to the overall harness diameter to maintain the wiring in a tight, neat bundle, and the ends are then neatly trimmed. In addition to continuous or running lacing, {{there are a variety}} of lacing patterns used in different circumstances. In some cases stand-alone knots called spot ties are also used. [...] For <b>lashing</b> large <b>cables</b> and cable bundles to support structures in telecommunications applications, there are two named cable lacing styles: the [...] "Chicago stitch" [...] and [...] "Kansas City stitch".|$|R
5000|$|Several of {{his former}} Raider staff {{expressed}} interest as Kiffin began assembling his new staff at the University of Tennessee. On December 15, 2008, Raiders head coach Tom <b>Cable</b> <b>lashed</b> out at Kiffin for hiring one of his assistants, James Cregg, with two weeks remaining in the NFL season. Cable called the timing of Cregg's departure [...] "wrong {{in the business of}} coaching" [...] and indicated he had lost respect for Kiffin and planned to confront him about it. Nothing further was said publicly regarding the incident.|$|R
50|$|Lashing is the {{securing}} {{of cargo}} for transportation {{with the goal}} of minimizing shifting. Items used for <b>lashing</b> include ropes, <b>cables,</b> wires, chains, strapping, and nets. These items are anchored to the container and tensioned against the cargo. Another form of lashing used four devices attached to the top of each corner of a container. Lashing is products and methods are governed by various authorities such as the Association of American Railroads (AAR) for rail transportation in North America, the international Maritime Organization (IMO) for ocean transportation and the National Motor Freight Traffic Association (NMFTA).|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} {{communication}} cables found on utility poles are copper or {{fibre optic cable}} (FOC) for telephone lines and coaxial cable for cable television (CATV). Coaxial or optical fibre cables linking computer networks are also increasingly found on poles in urban areas. The cable linking the telephone exchange to local customers is a thick <b>cable</b> <b>lashed</b> to a thin supporting cable, containing hundreds of twisted pair subscriber lines. Each twisted pair line provides a single telephone circuit or local loop to a customer. There may also be fibre optic cables interconnecting telephone exchanges. Like electrical distribution lines, communication cables connect to service drops when used to provide local service to customers.|$|R
500|$|Unloading {{began on}} 17 February. First ashore were the 75 dogs, {{with their two}} Sami handlers, who {{remained}} with them and thus became the first men to spend {{a night on the}} Antarctic continent. During the next twelve days the rest of the equipment and supplies were landed, and two prefabricated huts were erected, one as living quarters and the other for storage. These were the first buildings erected on the continent. A third structure was contrived from spare materials, to serve as a magnetic observation hut. [...] As accommodation for ten men the [...] "living hut" [...] was small and cramped, and seemingly precariousâ€”Bernacchi later described it as [...] "fifteen feet square, <b>lashed</b> down by <b>cables</b> to the rocky shore". The dogs were housed in kennels fashioned from packing cases. By 2 March the base, christened [...] "Camp Ridley" [...] after Borchgrevink's English mother's maiden name, was fully established, and the Duke of York's flag raised. That day, Southern Cross departed for Australia, to spend the winter there.|$|R
6000|$|The boats of Sir Hyde's {{division}} {{were actively}} employed {{all night in}} bringing out the prizes, and in getting afloat the ships which were on shore. At daybreak, Nelson, who had slept in his own ship, the St. George, rowed to the ELEPHANT; and his delight at finding her afloat seemed to give him new life. There he took a hasty breakfast, praising the men for their exertions, and then pushed off to the prizes, which {{had not yet been}} removed. The ZEALAND, seventy-four, the last which struck, had drifted on the shoal under the Trekroner; and relying, as it seems, upon the protection which that battery might have afforded, refused to acknowledge herself captured; saying, that though it was true her flag was not to be seen, her pendant was still flying. Nelson ordered one of our brigs and three long-boats to approach her, and rowed up himself to one of the enemy's ships, to communicate with the commodore. This officer proved to be an old acquaintance, whom he had known in the West Indies; so he invited himself on board, and with that urbanity as well as decision which always characterised him, urged his claim to the ZEALAND so well that it was admitted. The men from the boats <b>lashed</b> a <b>cable</b> round her bowsprit, and the gun-vessel towed her away. It is affirmed, and probably with truth, that the Danes felt more pain at beholding this than at all their misfortunes on the preceding day; and one of the officers, Commodore Steen Rille, went to the Trekroner battery, and asked the commander why he had not sunk the ZEALAND, rather than suffer her thus to be carried off by the enemy? ...|$|R
