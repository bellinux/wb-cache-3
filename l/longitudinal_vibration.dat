40|$|The {{capture of}} {{payloads}} using tethers is a challenging task from a control point of view. In previous studies on coplanar capture, the precapture control design {{has been achieved}} by assuming that the tether is inextensible. However, the effect of tether <b>longitudinal</b> <b>vibrations</b> can cause errors in {{the position and velocity}} of the tether tip. Furthermore, the extra mass {{at the tip of the}} tether can induce <b>longitudinal</b> <b>vibrations</b> with significant amplitude that ultimately cause the tether to become slack. A guidance scheme based on optimal control methodology that can achieve rendezvous with a payload using a longitudinally flexible tether is demonstrated. Rather than treating the precapture and postcapture phases separately, an integrated control scheme is developed that successfully guides the tether to achieve rendezvous with a payload and then simultaneously damps the tether librations and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>vibrations.</b> Closed-loop performance of the system is demonstrated using a receding-horizon control strategy...|$|R

5000|$|Pogo {{oscillation}} is a {{self-excited vibration}} in liquid-propellant rocket engines caused by combustion instability. [...] The unstable combustion results in variations of engine thrust, causing variations of acceleration on the vehicle's flexible structure, {{which in turn}} cause variations in propellant pressure and flow rate, closing the self-excitation cycle. The name is a metaphor comparing the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>vibration</b> to the bouncing of a pogo stick. Pogo oscillation places stress on {{the frame of the}} vehicle, which in severe cases is dangerous.|$|E
5000|$|String {{vibrations}} cause minute length variations, or stretching. With {{varying degrees}} of stretching, the tension varies. This {{can be thought of}} as <b>longitudinal</b> <b>vibration.</b> The strings are anchored to the bridge and the pull of the strings is directed to the side of the anchoring point. This creates a torsional force deforming the soundboard. When tension increases, it will create a belly below the bridge (away from the strings) and a dip above the bridge (under the strings). This deformation creates more complex sound waves than the push/pull action.|$|E
50|$|The {{failure of}} the bridge {{occurred}} when a never-before-seen twisting mode occurred, from winds at a mild 40 mph. This is a so-called torsional vibration mode (which {{is different from the}} transversal or <b>longitudinal</b> <b>vibration</b> mode), whereby when {{the left side of the}} roadway went down, the right side would rise, and vice versa (i.e., the two halves of the bridge twisted in opposite directions), with the center line of the road remaining still (motionless). Two men proved this point by walking along the center line, unaffected by the flapping of the roadway rising and falling to each side. This vibration was caused by aeroelastic fluttering.|$|E

40|$|<b>Longitudinal</b> <b>vibrations</b> of concrete-faced {{rockfill}} dams {{may cause}} significant compressive stresses and joint {{openings in the}} slab panels. The behavior of such dams subjected to <b>longitudinal</b> and vertical <b>vibrations</b> is investigated, based on numerical simulation of the staged construction, reservoir impoundment and seismic shaking. The static analysis uses a hyperbolic model for the rockfill, whereas the seismic analysis uses a nonlinear hysteretic model which accounts for the dynamic properties. A damage plasticity model {{is used for the}} reinforced concrete and frictional contact behavior is considered at the base and vertical sides of the concrete panels. The seismic analysis takes into account the flexibility of the canyon rock and potential dynamic rockfill settlements. An existing 150 m-high dam is used to investigate the effect of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>vibrations</b> on the compressive stresses near the slab-to-slab vertical interfaces and the opening of the joints. The effect of dynamic settlements is examined and comparisons are made to the response from upstream/downstream and combined vibrations. The effectiveness of introducing 5 cm-wide cuts at selected vertical joints to reduce slab compression in existing CFRDs is demonstrated. The presented results offer useful insight into the effect of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>vibrations</b> on the seismic behavior of CFRDs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|In 1817, Young had {{proposed}} a small transverse component to light, while yet retaining a far larger longitudinal component. Fresnel, {{by the year}} 1821, was able to show by mathematical methods that polarization could be explained only if light was entirely transverse, with no <b>longitudinal</b> <b>vibration</b> whatsoever. He proposed the aether drag hypothesis to explain a lack of variation in astronomical observations. His use of two plane mirrors of metal, forming with each other an angle of nearly 180°, allowed him to avoid the diffraction effects caused (by the apertures) in the experiment of F. M. Grimaldi on interference. This allowed him to conclusively account for the phenomenon of interference {{in accordance with the}} wave theory.|$|E

Neither was successful the second flight of a Luna 8K72 (October 11, 1958), which was to launch the Luna E-1 No.2 probe and ended 104 seconds after launch when the rocket again disintegrated from vibration. The third flight of a Luna 8K72 (December 4, 1958), which was to launch the Luna E-1 No.3 probe, also ended 245 seconds after launch when the Block-I core stage shut down from loss of engine lubricant.|$|E

40|$|The <b>longitudinal</b> <b>vibration</b> of {{the ship}} shaft system is {{the one of the}} most {{important}} factors of hull stern vibration, and it can be effectively minimized by installing a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>vibration</b> absorber. In this way, the vibration and noise of ships can be brought under control. However, the parameters of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>vibration</b> absorbers have a great influence on the vibration characteristics of the shaft system. As such, a certain shafting testing platform was studied as the object on which a finite model was built, and the relationship between longitudinal stiffness and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>vibration</b> in the shaft system was analyzed in a straight alignment state. Furthermore, a longitudinal damping model of the shaft system was built in which the parameters of the vibration absorber were non-dimensionalized, the weight of the vibration absorber was set as a constant, and an optimizing algorithm was used to calculate the optimized stiffness and damping coefficient of the vibration absorber. Finally, the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>vibration</b> frequency response of the shafting testing platform before and after optimizing the parameters of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>vibration</b> absorber were compared, and the results indicated that the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>vibration</b> of the shafting testing platform was decreased effectively, which suggests that it could provide a theoretical foundation for the parameter optimization of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>vibration</b> absorbers...|$|E

Reducing these hull vibrations becomes increasingly {{important to make}} better surroundings for crew and to prolong the life of ship hull and machines. This report shows how hull vibrations are reduced by replacing conventional CPP blades with highly skewed CPP blades. The results of the replacement are as follows: 1) Vertical and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>vibrations</b> are effectively reduced and further both vibrations perceived by human bodies are reduced at the stern part of the ship. 2) The further {{the distance from the}} propeller, the smaller the effect of reducing vertical vibrations, and the tendency of reducing <b>longitudinal</b> <b>vibrations</b> is recognized up to near the main engine. 3) Athwart vibrations are hardly reduced at the almost every part of the ship. 昭和 62 年の入渠時,従来型のプロペラ翼からハイリースキュードプロペラ翼への換装を行い,両プロペラ装備時のそれぞれの振動計測を船内各部において実施し,次のような結果を得た。 1) 船尾部分においては,垂直方向および船首尾方向(水平) の振動とも減少が顕著で,体感振動の減少も測定結果と同様であった。 2) 垂直方向の振動は,プロペラからの距離が大きくなるに従いその減少割合が低下し,船首尾方向の振動の減少は主機関に近い部分まで認められた。 3) 左右舷方向(水平) の振動はどの場所でも殆ど減少しないことがわかった...|$|R
