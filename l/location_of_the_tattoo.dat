5000|$|Common {{designs and}} themes grew over the years, often having {{different}} meanings {{depending on the}} <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tattoo.</b> The imagery often does not literally mean what it is depicting—for example, tattoos displaying Nazi imagery represent a rejection of authority rather than an adherence to Nazism. Combinations of imagery, such as a rose, barbed wire and a dagger, form combined meanings. According to lexicographer Alexei Plutser-Sarno, the tattoos become the only [...] "real aspects of his life". They are {{a symbol of the}} owner's commitment to war against the non-thief, the police (menty), and the [...] "bitch" [...] (suka). The environment in the Soviet era was one of heavy visual propaganda, and the tattoos are a reaction to that, and a [...] "grin at authority" [...] (oskal na vlast), often directly parodying official Soviet slogans with Communist Party leaders often depicted as devils, donkeys, or pigs.|$|E

50|$|The Court {{also held}} that <b>the</b> {{business}} <b>of</b> <b>tattooing</b> {{does not affect}} whether or not <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> <b>tattooing</b> is free expression. <b>The</b> sale <b>of</b> artwork does not remove the expressive content from being protected by the First Amendment. This protection does not become diminished as the artwork is sold. The Court noted that <b>the</b> sale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tattoo</b> is intertwined with <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> <b>tattooing</b> and <b>the</b> <b>tattoo</b> itself. <b>The</b> business <b>of</b> <b>tattooing</b> is therefore pure expressive activity that is entitled to full protection under the First Amendment.|$|R
40|$|As <b>tattoos</b> {{migrate from}} <b>the</b> margins <b>of</b> society to more visible and {{acceptable}} venues, there exists {{the need to}} study this cultural artifact in a comprehensive manner. While studies have examined <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tattoo</b> as a readable text and as an act in Eastern cultures, discussion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tattoo</b> in <b>the</b> West has consistently focused on <b>the</b> <b>tattoo</b> {{as an act of}} deviance. This thesis breaks that pattern by engaging in an analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tattoo</b> design work, commonly known as 2 ̆ 7 flash, 2 ̆ 7 of Norman 2 ̆ 2 Sailor Jerry 2 ̆ 2 Collins. Recognized as a highly influential figure in <b>the</b> American <b>tattoo</b> industry, Sailor Jerry 2 ̆ 7 s work is analyzed with tools of art history, formalism and contextual ism, and semiotic theory to examine <b>the</b> content <b>of</b> his designs from the 1940 s to the 1960 s. In doing so, I illuminate the way compositional features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> designs highlight contextually pertinent symbolism in the imagery. The meaning derived from these combinations of formal, contextual, and symbolic features leads me to assert that Sailor Jerry 2 ̆ 7 s designs communicate messages that speak directly to the times in which they were created by upholding significant cultural traditions and, ironically, reflecting the progressive cultural ideologies pervading the United States after World War II. This thesis, therefore, shows <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> looking at <b>the</b> <b>tattoo</b> as more than a deviant act by focusing on <b>the</b> content <b>of</b> <b>tattooed</b> imagery and identifying meaning in the work...|$|R
