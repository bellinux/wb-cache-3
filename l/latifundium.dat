During the Caguán peace process, the FARC demanded the recovery of unproductive land for agrarian reform. The FARC arrived in Havana with moderated views on the subject - their proposals included stimulation of agricultural use of land for food production to achieve food sovereignty, empowering rural communities and formalization of property titles.|$|E
2500|$|The {{predominant}} 16th century {{agricultural production}} organization, the Szlachta's folwark gave {{way by the}} middle of the 17th century to the magnate-owned latifundia, huge networks of landed estates. Latifundia were present throughout the Polish–Lithuanian federation, but developed most extensively in the eastern reaches of the Crown, having expanded in that direction before the Union of Lublin. War destruction affected the diversified magnate possessions to a lesser degree than single estates of middle szlachta, which increasingly turned szlachta into dependent clients of their [...] "elder brothers". Parts of a <b>latifundium</b> were typically leased or run by hired szlachta or urban, often Jewish, hierarchy of administrators, with each layer exploiting the serf laborers. The various aspects of commercial life in the territories, including agriculture, trade, mining, and manufacturing, had previously been controlled by szlachta in a legally protected way. Now, in the more decentralized and anarchistic feudal state, the magnate class was in a position to establish in its state-like domains absolute rule, based not on laws but on practical advantages they enjoyed. The regional authority and power that the magnates attained was exerted by a variety of means, including private military forces.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Silence of the Oppressed: the Narration of Subjugation and Repression in Saramago’s Levantado del suelo and Delibes’s Los santos inocentes. This article {{analyses}} and compares the narration of subjugation, repression and physical abuse in José Saramago’s Levantado del suelo (1980) and Miguel Delibes’s Los santos inocentes (1981). The {{purpose of the}} study is to analyse the similarities between two fables dealing with the same problem: the hard-working conditions in <b>latifundiums</b> in the Portuguese region of Alentejo and the Spanish Extremadura, the workers’ impossibility of changing their lives and the subjugation and repression they would face in terms of political, military and ecclesiastical power. Specifically, the study focuses on the relations between privileged people and farmers and how the former deprive the latter of their rights in order to maintain their status through the narration. The article begins with an overview of both the content and the characters of the two novels. Then, we select and analyse some climactic episodes in which the abuses against farmers take place, paying special attention to how the two narrators define their positions on the workers’ side. Finally, we examine how the accumulation of the power suppresses the eruption of any riot in both novels...|$|R

40|$|Research work {{dealt with}} the {{question}} of how the present results of the agrarian transformation in the New States have - since unification - created starting conditions for a prospering economic and socio-cultural development. Setting social transformations aside, the development in the agricultural sector results to a greater part from the agrarian policies in the former Soviet Zone of Occupation and GDR. At the onset, a critical ideological analysis of above all the ideas of the former German Social Democracy and Marxism is presented, as they were the ideological justification for the first agrarian transformation. Land reform began in the summer of 1945. All farms larger than approx. 2. 5 British acres were nationalised without compensation. A greater part of the confiscated land was cut in to very small fields. Large farms continued to exist above all in Saxony and Thuringia. Political directives of the SED (East German Communist Party) {{led to the creation of}} agrarian co-operatives (LPG) in 1952. They followed the model of the Soviet kolkhoz. The LPG's were no coherent with the idea of a co-operative as they were a kind of state farm, with farmers as agrarian employees. In general, functionaries of the SED were in charge. A massive process of agro-industrialisation followed in the decades after the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961. <b>Latifundiums</b> of up to 25. 000 acres resulted. A law dealing with adjustments in the agrarian sector was passed after the economic and political collapse of the GDR. The aim was the adjustment of the East German agricultural sector to a social market economy. The law on restitution and compensation payments (EALG) passed in 1994 was meant to compensate the victims of the communist land reform. The law determined that affected persons could purchase equivalent land at reduced prices. Yet, specific clauses within the law made a fair compensation in reality impossible. The agro-industrial structures that had resulted from the forced collectivising of the SED-dictatorship were in general maintained. Up to 90 % of farming land in the Ostvorpommern Region analysed in this study are today the private property of former SED agro-functionaries. There are over 1. 600 large farms in the New States that incorporate more than 2. 500 acres of agricultural area. A hand-over of power by the regional elite's has not taken place. The new socio-political developments of 1989 / 90 in the GDR have to a much smaller extent established themselves in today's rural areas compared to the urban centres. Rather more, it must be established, that the previous cadre structures have remained and in some cases continue to act as 'secret societies'. Economic initiatives under these conditions did not fulfil the expectations. The result was a considerable migration of the work force. As a result, the study presents suggestion for law reform...|$|R

40|$|Other land {{property}} forms than the private are often conceived as residues of the past, residues that paradoxically seem never to pass away. An {{example is the}} form of semi-communal land ownership of the agricultural communities of Chile’s Region IV. Using sociological and historical research methods, this study explores the origin {{and the emergence of}} this agrarian form during the last four centuries, through the community Canela Baja and the neighbouring <b>latifundium</b> El Totoral, as a contrasting case. Having on one hand, the form of communal land as the common denominator, we have on the other the social aspects resulting from particular histories of the form. Therefore, a distinction between imposed and spontaneous forms is introduced. Confronting the case study with research results from other socio-political and material conditions, the study suggest that while some of the present communal ownership forms are the outcome of political decisions, others are of long historical processes. The imposed forms are not so much communities; rather reserves or homelands. Differentiating it from both private property and the so called “tragedy of the commons“, communal land ownership is conceived as an institution of its own which in Chile shares the same historical origin in colonial land grants as private property. Since they have kept their territorial integrity permanently in an undivided form, the study suggest that these agrarian collectives have historically avoided their conversion into minifundium, being thus a resource management solution, which acted as a brake to land fragmentation. Thus, the communal form represents not only another historical pattern of development, but also another way of organising ownership and production than both the <b>latifundium</b> and minifundium.

40|$|This paper aims at {{contributing}} to the debate on contemporary environmental issues in settlement areas in Brazil.

Based on research carried out in two settlements located in Paraiba’s semi-arid region, this paper argues that the settlement process of landless rural workers goes, necessarily, through the reorganization of property rights and the establishment of social arrangements for the effective control of commonly shared resources {{as a response to the}} collapse of <b>latifundium</b> property rights and settlers’ conflicts, both among themselves and with external actors, regarding the exploitation of natural resources. The work reveals how the contradictions between the effective use of commonly shared resources, and the institutionalized forms of nature protection and delay in the land distribution, create uncertainties that favor the “tragedy of commons” and hinder the emergence of environmental conservation initiatives...|$|E
