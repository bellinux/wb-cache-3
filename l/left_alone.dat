5|$|As the Mk. XIV could {{calculate}} {{the effects of}} a shallow climb or dive (or glide as it is referred to in bombing), the computor included its own levelling mechanism.

Since these were in a fixed relationship to each other, levelling could be carried out on the ground and then <b>left</b> <b>alone.</b> Any adjustments required were recorded on a card fixed {{to the front of the}} computor.|$|E
