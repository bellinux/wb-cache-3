Firstly, basing {{statistical}} results pavement {{quality indicator}} (PQI) calibration value of asphalt pavement with different aggregate types and nominal maximum aggregate sizes, the importance degree {{of the influence}} of the two factors on PQI calibration value was obtained by using the statistical software of SPSS. Then, PQI was used to detect the compaction of asphalt pavement and the detecting results of <b>loose</b> <b>laying</b> density, <b>loose</b> <b>laying</b> thickness and compaction density of asphalt mixture were used to calculate the thickness of asphalt pavement. All results above were compared and analyzed with the detect results of cores. Finally, the construction quality process control method of asphalt pavement was described. Results show that the aggregate type and material quality is the important factor to the PQI calibration value; the density of asphalt pavement detected by PQI and the thickness calculated have fine correlation with the detecting results of cores, those detecting results are dependable; The construction quality instant control of asphalt pavement could be achieved by detecting the <b>loose</b> <b>laying</b> density and thickness of asphalt mixtures...|$|E

She crept as near him as she could without disturbing his rest; and stretching out one arm so that it timidly embraced his neck, and hiding her face on the other, over which her damp and scattered hair fell <b>loose,</b> <b>lay</b> motionless.|$|R
60|$|The mightiest {{chiefs of}} British song Scorned not such legends to prolong: They gleam through Spenser's elfin dream, And mix in Milton's heavenly theme; And Dryden, in immortal strain, Had raised the Table Round again, But that a ribald king and court Bade him toil on, {{to make them}} sport; Demanded for their niggard pay, Fit for their souls, a <b>looser</b> <b>lay,</b> Licentious satire, song, and play; The world {{defrauded}} of the high design, Profaned the God-given strength, and marred the lofty line.|$|R
60|$|Fortunately a <b>loose</b> brick <b>lay</b> handy {{and with}} this Dick smashed out the panes of glass in the cellar window. Another window was opposite, and this he {{likewise}} demolished. At once a current of pure air swept through the place.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now about servants. Oh!" [...] She had darted up {{the last}} stairs to the {{chequered}} darkness of the top floor, where <b>loose</b> tiles <b>lay</b> among broken laths, and the walls were scrawled with names, sentiments, and hop records. [...] "They've been keeping pigeons here," [...] she cried.|$|R

60|$|We {{had come}} to an end. A great {{projecting}} buttress of crag rose sheer in front. Above <b>lay</b> <b>loose</b> boulders. Below was a shrub-hung precipice. The birds we had seen from home were still circling and screaming.|$|R
60|$|James {{had already}} {{followed}} her instructions {{and used his}} chisel. The plank <b>lay</b> <b>loose</b> on the floor. With both his big hands he rapidly cleared away the mould and the rubbish. In {{a few minutes the}} hiding-place was laid bare.|$|R
60|$|Lapham {{seemed quite}} beaten down by this argument. His huge head hung forward over his breast; the reins <b>lay</b> <b>loose</b> in his moveless hand; the mare took her own way. At last {{he lifted his}} face and shut his heavy jaws.|$|R
60|$|The sun {{was at its}} highest, and it {{was very}} hot; the road was a rough track where <b>loose</b> stones <b>lay</b> among the heavy dust. Where water ran down the {{hillside}} in artificial channels, there were palms and belts of foliage; elsewhere outcropping rock and stones flung up a dazzling brightness. In the background, rugged peaks rose against a sky of intense blue, and far off on the opposite hand a misty gleam indicated the sea.|$|R
60|$|A {{number of}} large <b>loose</b> stones <b>lay</b> about on the little plateau that crowned our mound. These we rolled {{close to the edge}} of it, and ranging them in line with those that were already there, formed a sort of breastwork all round. Our three guns we had of course brought with us, as well as ammunition, and as mine was a double-barrelled fowling-piece we had thus four shots at command at any moment. The weapons being already charged, we placed {{ourselves}} at three points of our circle and prepared for a weary watch.|$|R
60|$|He roared a mad curse as {{his hand}} clapped {{down to his}} gun. Then I fired through my sombrero. Snecker's big horse plunged. The rustler fell back, {{and one of his}} legs pitched high as he slid off the lunging steed. His other foot caught in the stirrup. This fact terribly frightened the horse. He bolted, {{dragging}} the rustler for a dozen jumps. Then Snecker's foot slipped <b>loose.</b> He <b>lay</b> limp and still and shapeless in the road. I did not {{need to go back to}} look him over.|$|R
60|$|It {{was on the}} Christmas day following, in the evening, that, {{to finish}} a long train of wickedness, I went abroad to see what might offer in my way; when going by a working silversmith's in Foster Lane, I saw a tempting bait indeed, and not be {{resisted}} by one of my occupation, for the shop had nobody in it, as I could see, {{and a great deal}} of <b>loose</b> plate <b>lay</b> in the window, and at the seat of the man, who usually, as I suppose, worked at one side of the shop.|$|R

60|$|But the overweening {{power of}} his body {{was too much for}} her. She relaxed again, and <b>lay</b> <b>loose</b> and soft, panting in a little delirium. And to him, she was so sweet, she was such bliss of release, that he would have {{suffered}} a whole eternity of torture rather than forego one second of this pang of unsurpassable bliss.|$|R
6000|$|And {{over the}} limbs and the valley the slow owls wandered and came, [...] Now {{in a place}} of star-fire, and now in a shadow place wide; [...] And the chief of the huge white creatures, his knees [...] in the soft star-flame, [...] <b>Lay</b> <b>loose</b> {{in a place of}} shadow: we drew the reins by his side.|$|R
60|$|In {{the side}} pocket of Uncle John's <b>loose</b> coat <b>lay</b> a loaded revolver, {{which he had}} carried ever since he had {{received}} Mr. Watson's warning letter. He had never imagined a condition of danger where he could not use this weapon to defend himself, {{and as long as}} it remained by him he had feared nothing. But he had been made a prisoner in so deft a manner that he had no opportunity to expostulate or offer any sort of resistance. Later there might be a chance to fight for his liberty, and the only sensible action was to wait and bide his time.|$|R
6000|$|... "How am I to know, Sir Thomas? I don't know, Sir Thomas. It's like {{enough in}} one of those drawers." [...] Then Stemm pointed to a certain table, and after a while slowly {{followed}} his own finger. The drawer was unlocked, and under various <b>loose</b> papers there <b>lay</b> four or five loose keys. [...] "Like enough it's one of these," [...] said Stemm.|$|R
60|$|The man I saw {{wrote with}} {{a thing like}} a {{fountain}} pen, a modern touch that prohibited any historical retrospection, and as he finished each sheet, writing in an easy flowing hand, he added it to a growing pile upon a graceful little table under the window. His last done sheets <b>lay</b> <b>loose,</b> partly covering others that were clipped together into fascicles.|$|R
50|$|The group {{particularly}} {{believes in}} hidden terma treasures. Traditionally, Nyingmapa practice was advanced orally among a <b>loose</b> network of <b>lay</b> practitioners. Monasteries with celibate monks and nuns, {{along with the}} practice of reincarnated spiritual leaders are later adaptations, though Padmasambhava {{is regarded as the}} founder of Samye Gompa, the first monastery in the country. In modern times the Nyingma lineage has been centered in Kham in eastern Tibet.|$|R
5000|$|Hammie’s artistic {{direction}} {{began to}} take shape in 2007, when he considered his reaction to his father’s untimely death in 1999. According to Hammie, “I’d become emotionally reserved, which led me to question the source of this behavior and art’s role in representing and nurturing such masculine traits.” This reflection inspired Hammie; he painted his un-idealized brown body as the antithesis of the hard-bodied heroes of Old Master imagery. In his 2007 painting, Protuberance, Hammie portrays himself pulling and tugging at his bulky <b>loose</b> flesh, <b>laying</b> the groundwork for his first project Imperfect Colossi. This series of paintings and drawings visualize Hammie’s effort to reshape himself and propose the possibility of a new ideal, one positioned more as a work in progress than an achievable end.|$|R

Still, it will be ’most three hours yet before there’s water in, and if the gunboat came along I’d sooner be here, where I’ve room to run, than jammed right up between her and a lee shore. If I was sure that was the high ground behind Point Sparto I’d feel considerably happier.” ...|$|R
60|$|THE {{sun shone}} pleasantly warm, {{and a soft}} wind sighed among the branches, when Violet Wayne pulled up her ponies where {{the shadows of the}} firs fell athwart the winding road that dipped to Northrop valley. There had been a shower, and a sweet {{resinous}} fragrance came out of the dusky wood. Godfrey Palliser, who sat by the girl’s side, however, shivered a little, and buttoned the big fur‐trimmed coat that <b>lay</b> <b>loose</b> about him, which did not escape his companion’s attention.|$|R
60|$|We rose {{next morning}} with nipped feet and hands, which {{a cup of}} hot coffee, 'with,' speedily corrected, and were en route at 4.30 A.M. Formerly animals were left at the lower estancia; now they are readily taken on to Alta Vista. My wife rode a sure-footed black nag, I a mule which was perfect whilst the foot-long lever acting curb <b>lay</b> <b>loose</b> on its neck. Returning, we were amazed at the places they had passed during the moonless night.|$|R
50|$|The Nyingma {{particularly}} {{believes in}} hidden terma treasures and place {{an emphasis on}} Dzogchen. They also incorporate local religious practices and local deities and elements of shamanism, some of which it shares with Bon. The Nyingma tradition actually comprises several distinct lineages that all trace their origins to the Indian master Padmasambhava. Traditionally, Nyingmapa practice was advanced orally among a <b>loose</b> network of <b>lay</b> practitioners. Monasteries with celibate monks and nuns, along with the practice of reincarnated spiritual leaders are later adaptations.|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] added Ja, [...] "there is an {{entrance}} {{near the base}} of which even the Mahars know nothing. Come," [...] and he led me across the clearing and about the end to a pile of <b>loose</b> rock which <b>lay</b> against {{the foot of the}} wall. Here he removed a couple of large bowlders, revealing a small opening which led straight within the building, or so it seemed, though as I entered after Ja I discovered myself in a narrow place of extreme darkness.|$|R
60|$|Now I {{could no}} longer bridle in my desire to be with Elliot, and learn whether I was indeed forgiven, and how I stood in her favour. So, passing down the stair that led from my cubicle, I {{stood at the door}} of the room wherein she was and knocked twice. But none answered, and, venturing to enter, I heard the sound of a stifled sob. She had thrown herself on a settle, her face turned to the wall, and the {{afternoon}} sun was shining on her yellow hair, which <b>lay</b> <b>loose</b> upon her shoulders.|$|R
2500|$|Pope still {{insisted that}} he needed a gunboat to cover his {{projected}} landing on the Tennessee side of the river. Foote called two councils of war among his captains; in the first, on March 20, his decision not to risk running past the batteries was confirmed. When Halleck wrote to Foote, saying, [...] "Give him (Pope) all the assistance in your power," [...] Foote called a second council, on March 29. This time, Commander Henry Walke, captain of , thought that the risk was worth the candle, and volunteered to take his boat through. Foote gave the necessary orders, and Carondelet was prepared for the run. She was covered with rope, chain, and whatever <b>loose</b> material <b>lay</b> at hand. A coal barge filled with coal and hay was lashed to her side. Her steam exhaust was diverted from the smokestacks (called [...] "chimneys" [...] on river craft) to muffle the sound. She then had only {{to wait for a}} sufficiently dark night to make her run.|$|R
60|$|How long he {{sat there}} no one knows; but late at night, when {{the people at the}} Red Lion began to miss their guest, and turned out in a body to hunt for him in the corner field, they found him sitting still {{on the edge of the}} pit he had dug for the grave of his own hopes, and gazing still with {{listless}} eyes into blank vacancy. A box of <b>loose</b> coin <b>lay</b> idly scattered on the ground beside him. The poor gentleman had been struck crazy, they whispered to one another; and so indeed he had: not raving mad with acute insanity, but blankly, hopelessly, and helplessly imbecile. With the loss of John Cann's treasure the whole universe had faded out for him into abject nihilism. They carried him home to the inn between them on their arms, and put him to bed carefully in the old bedroom, as one might put a new-born baby.|$|R

6000|$|Oh, you foolish, foolish little maidens, {{with your}} dainty heads {{so full of}} unwisdom! how often--oh! how often, are you to be warned {{that it is not}} always the sweetest thing in lovers that is the best {{material}} to make a good-wearing husband out of?

60|$|The {{greater part}} of {{the floor of the}} cavern was covered with {{boulders}} of rock or with hard incrustations of lime, but at this particular point there had been a drip from the distant roof, which had left a patch of soft mud. In the very centre of this there was a huge mark--an ill-defined blotch, deep, broad and irregular, as if a great boulder had fallen upon it. No <b>loose</b> stone <b>lay</b> near, however, nor was there anything to account for the impression. It was far too large to be caused by any possible animal, and besides, there was only the one, and the patch of mud was of such a size that no reasonable stride could have covered it. As I rose from the examination of that singular mark and then looked round into the black shadows which hemmed me in, I must confess that I felt for a moment a most unpleasant sinking of my heart, and that, do what I could, the candle trembled in my outstretched hand.|$|R
5|$|The tall {{stranger}} {{says that}} he who draws the sword from the trunk shall receive it as a gift, and he {{who is able to}} pull free the sword shall never carry a better sword than it. The old man leaves the hall, and nobody knows who he was, or where he went. Everyone stands, trying their hand at pulling free the sword from the trunk of Barnstokkr. The noblest attempt to pull free the sword first followed by those ranked after them. Sigmund, son of King Völsung, takes his turn, and—as if the sword had <b>lay</b> <b>loose</b> for him—he draws it from the trunk. The saga then continues.|$|R
60|$|One of {{her arms}} made a pillow for her head; her soft dark hair, unfastened, half hid her, like a veil; the other arm <b>lay</b> <b>loose</b> by her side; her lips were white, her face was bloodless; but there was blood on the deep-blue folds about the bosom, and on the floor. At the further side of this girl--who was dead, or {{seemingly}} dead--sat, on a low stool, a woman, in a crouching, cat-like attitude, quite silent and still. The knife with which she had done the deed was dripping in her hand; {{the noise of the}} broken door, and of the entering throng, had not disturbed her.|$|R
