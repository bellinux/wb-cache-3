40|$|Continuum {{mechanics}} is {{the leading}} tool used in computational solid mechanics. Continuum mechanics, however, assumes a material’s body to be continuous, represented by analytical functions. This assumption is unrealistic for reinforced concrete structures, which become discontinuous as cracks form. 	Silling has proposed a nonlocal theory called peridynamics and Gerstle has specialized his idea to develop the state-based peridynamic lattice model (SPLM). The SPLM sufficiently models nonlinear deformation fields using an organized <b>lattice,</b> <b>force</b> states, and stretches. 	In this thesis, we use, develop, and modify the SPLM to model reinforced concrete structures. We use the SPLM to predict {{the strength of a}} very large reinforced concrete beam, develop the bond-slip model between steel and concrete in the SPLM, and we demonstrate how to apply loads sequentially to a beam.

40|$|<b>Lattice</b> <b>forces</b> {{are based}} on the {{attraction}} between the single moieties of molecules. The strength of <b>lattice</b> <b>forces</b> has an impact on the solid state and related physical properties such as melting point, boiling point, vapor pressure solvation and solubility. For solvation to occur, energy is required to break the <b>lattice</b> <b>forces</b> attracting ions and molecules among themselves. The energy for breaking up the attraction between the molecules is gained from the energy released when ions or molecules of the lattice associate with molecules of the solvent. Solubility is therefore, directly linked to the energy which is required to break the <b>lattice</b> <b>forces</b> and the energy which is liberated by solvation of the molecules or ions. Based on this relation, the <b>lattice</b> <b>forces</b> in two acidic compounds and a neutral compound were subsequently lowered by different approaches with the intention to increase the solubility, supersaturation, and dissolution rate. The conversion to an ionic liquid and the embedding of the compound in a pH-sensitive matrix in an amorphous state were investigated with an acidic compound and its pro-drug. The tetrabutylphosphonium (TBPH) salt showed the most promising properties among the tested counter ions. It alters the properties of the compound from a highly crystalline physicochemical state to an amorphous readily soluble material showing supersaturation in a wider pH range and higher solubility than the sodium and potassium salts.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{properties}} of nuclear matter with lattice nucleon-nucleon (NN) potential in the relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (RBHF) theory. To use this potential in such a microscopic many-body theory, we firstly have to construct a one-boson-exchange potential (OBEP) based on the latest lattice NN potential. Three mesons, pion, σ meson, and ω meson, are considered. Their coupling constants and cut-off momenta are determined by fitting the on-shell behaviors and phase shifts of the <b>lattice</b> <b>force,</b> respectively. Therefore, we obtain two parameter sets of the OBEP potential (named as LOBEP 1 and LOBEP 2) with these two fitting ways. We calculate {{the properties of}} symmetric and pure neutron matter with LOBEP 1 and LOBEP 2. In non-relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock case, the binding energies of symmetric nuclear matter are around - 3 and - 5 MeV at saturation densities, while it becomes - 8 and - 12 MeV in relativistic framework with ^ 1 S_ 0, ^ 3 S_ 1, and ^ 3 D_ 1 channels using our two parameter sets.

They are, therefore, suitable for capturing generic features of protein folding and amyloid formation at low computational cost. As our aim is to study the critical nucleus sizes of two experimentally well-characterized peptide fragments A beta(16 - 22) and A beta(37 - 42) of the full length A beta(1 - 42) Alzheimer peptide, {{it is important that}} simulations with the lattice model reproduce all-atom simulations. In this study, we present a comprehensive force field parameterization based on the OPEP (Optimized Potential for Efficient protein structure Prediction) force field for an on-lattice protein model, which incorporates explicitly the formation of hydrogen bonds and directions of side-chains. Our bottom-up approach starts with the determination of the best <b>lattice</b> <b>force</b> parameters for the A beta(16 - 22) dimer by fitting its equilibrium parallel and anti-parallel beta-sheet populations to all-atom simulation results. Surprisingly, the calibrated force field is transferable to the trimer of A beta(16 - 22) and the dimer and trimer of A beta(37 - 42). Encouraged by this finding, we characterized the free energy landscapes of the two decamers. The dominant structure of the A beta(16 - 22) decamer matches the microcrystal structure. Pushing the simulations for aggregates between 4 -mer and 12 -mer suggests a nucleus size for fibril formation of 10 chains. In contrast, the A beta(37 - 42) decamer is largely disordered with mixed by parallel and antiparallel chains, suggesting that the nucleus size is > 10 peptides. Our refined force field coupled to this on-lattice model should provide useful insights into the critical nucleation number associated with neurodegenerative diseases.

40|$|Research {{directed}} toward understanding the dynamical factors governing the adsorption of molecules typically involved in heterogeneous catalytic processes has been continued at Harvard. Adsorption {{is the first}} step in any catalytic process, and predictions of rates of adsorption are fundamental to calculations of rates of catalytic reactions. Often activation of the bonds within the molecule proceed via a molecular precursor, and the rate of activation is determined by competitive bond activation and desorption of this precursor. Thus predictive capabilities for the adsorption probabilities of hydrocarbons become important for understanding the rates of simple reactions involving alkanes, such as reforming. In this work we have focused on the dynamics of molecular adsorption of low molecular weight alkanes on single crystal surfaces of platinum group metals in order to understand how different physical properties of the metals affect different trapping (adsorption) probabilities of the alkanes. The overall objective of these studies was to make a quantitative comparison of the molecular probabilities of C{sub 2 }-C{sub 4 } alkanes on different metals in order to assess the effects of the structures of the different alkanes and the intrinsic differences of the metals on the reactivity of the alkanes. This work built on previous studies with platinum and palladium single crystal surfaces for which we were able to apply molecular dynamic simulations to quantitatively predict trapping probabilities of low molecular weight alkanes for palladium directly from measured values of the trapping of ethane (only) on Pt(111). The trapping probabilities for the alkanes are higher on Pd(111) due to a larger dissipation of energy to lattice vibrations upon collision, suggesting a general scaling of trapping with the <b>lattice</b> <b>force</b> constant for different metal surfaces, provided the surface structure is not too different. In this grant period we have thus focused on the dynamics of molecular adsorption of low molecular weight alkanes on single crystal surfaces of platinum, palladium, copper, silver and nickel in order to assess this scaling directly. We observe that the trapping of each of the alkanes studied decreases with the lattice stiffness and mass of the metal atom, but not as strongly as predicted by the lattice for constant itself. These observations are in general agreement with the expectations of molecular dynamic simulations, but further theoretical work is needed to understand the trends in detail...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: To clarify {{further the}} {{mechanism}} of regulation by phosphorylation of isocitrate dehydrogenase, cocrystallization of isocitrate dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase {{in the presence of}} an ATP analog was attempted. Although cocrystallization was unsuccessful, a new crystal form of isocitrate dehydrogenase was obtained which provides insight into the phosphorylation mechanism. The new, orthorhombic crystal form of isocitrate dehydrogenase is related to the previously reported tetragonal form largely by an ∼ 16 ° shift of a large domain relative to the small domain and clasp region within each subunit of the dimeric enzyme. The NADP + cofactor binding surface is significantly disrupted by the shift to the open conformation. The solvent-accessible surface area and surface-enclosed volume increase by 2 % relative to the dimeric tetragonal form. Most of the increase results from expansion of the active site cleft such that the distance across its opening increases from approximately 5 to 13 Å, significantly increasing accessibility to Ser- 113. The conformation of isocitrate dehydrogenase in the orthorhombic crystal form more closely resembles that of the crystal structure of the homologous enzyme 3 -isopropylmalate dehydrogenase than does the tetragonal isocitrate dehydrogenase conformation.

IR spectroscopy of the keteniminines isolated in Ar matrixes or as neat films, NMR spectroscopy of 10 c, and theoretical calculations (B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G*) demonstrate that these ketenimines have variable geometry, being essentially linear along the CCN-R framework in polar media (neat films and solution), {{but in the}} gas phase or Ar matrix they are bent, as is usual for ketenimines.

While other local helix parameters may be influenced or even established by crystal packing, the properties just enumerated are determined primarily by base sequence. One and the same crystal packing scheme can accommodate a bend {{in one of two}} different directions, or no bend at all. A-tract regions of B-DNA are inherently straight and unbent, with base-pair inclination no different from that of general-sequence B-DNA. Where bends are observed at junctions between G. C and A.

The G. C/A. T junction appears to be a flexible hinge, capable of adopting either a straight or a bent conformation under the local influence of weak crystal packing forces. Such forces therefore are a source of information about DNA deformability and not a curse to be deplored.

40|$|In {{the absence}} of gravity drainage, froth wicking draws excess fluid onto a bubble <b>lattice.</b> Capillary <b>forces</b> only cause fluid transport; a moving front moves stably and without fluid {{fingering}} along a constant velocity bubble-fluid contact line. This percolation of fluid crawling up the lattice shows fluid coverage on lattice borders varies linearly with available surface area (proportional to lattice perimeter) and fluid accelerates through regions or nests of high bubble density (number of bubbles/sq cm). The development of nearly two-dimensional bubble lattices in variable gravity (step function between 0. 01 and 1. 8 times earthly gravity) are examined experimentally and a zeroth-order model for froth wetting is presented, which captures many of the principal observations. Possible applications for bubble lattices include adhesion casting of metals and separation of biological cells, bacteria, and particles...|$|R
