The results of the analysis in Table  6 show that family socioeconomic status has a significant negative impact on children’s learning enthusiasm.

40|$|<b>Learning</b> <b>behavior</b> is {{critical}} to preschool social-emotional and academic development and is significantly related to later educational outcomes (Early Learning Standards, 2002; Head Start Bureau, 2001; Phillips, Stott, 2 ̆ 6 Birrell, 1987; Wentzel 2 ̆ 6 Watkins, 2002). As <b>learning</b> <b>behaviors</b> posses the unique property of responsiveness to intervention (Phillips et al., 1987; Ramey 2 ̆ 6 Ramey, 1994; Snow, 1996; Stott, 1985; Wentzel 2 ̆ 6 Watkins, 2002), this investigation sought to increase the current understanding of preschool <b>learning</b> <b>behaviors</b> {{with the goal of}} informing practice. The Preschool <b>Learning</b> <b>Behaviors</b> Scale (PLBS; McDermott, Green, Francis, 2 ̆ 6 Stott, 2000) provides a method for assessing <b>learning</b> <b>behavior</b> in 3 - to 5 -year-old children. The PLBS is a 29 -item, teacher observation measure yielding three dimensions: Competence Motivation, Attention/Persistence, and Attitude Toward Learning. Traditionally, users have had to apply a variable-centered approach, relying on the three dimensions. ^ This investigation employed a child-centered approach in the examination of patterns of preschool <b>learning</b> <b>behavior.</b> Hierarchical cluster analysis was employed to discern a meaningful typology of such behavior. The participants (N = 1, 665) in this study were drawn from the School District of Philadelphia Head Start program. The analysis yielded six replicable cluster types. The composition of the resultant cluster types, including age and gender distinctions, was ascertained. The temporal stability of the typology was examined and demonstrated mixed results. The capacity of the cluster types to explain outcomes and risk in kindergarten and first-grade was assessed. <b>Learning</b> <b>behavior</b> types differentially related to early academic outcomes and demonstrated differences in risk for early academic failure. The typology did not significantly augment the variation in outcome variables explained by the dimensions. Conversely, the typology evinced differential risk for academic failure despite the lack of appropriate identification of risk by converted <b>learning</b> <b>behavior</b> dimensions. The implications of the findings were discussed. ...|$|R

25|$|When a {{motivating}} operation causes {{an increase}} in the effectiveness of a reinforcer, or amplifies a <b>learned</b> <b>behavior</b> in some way (such as increasing frequency, intensity, duration or speed of the behavior), it functions as an establishing operation, EO. A common example of this would be food deprivation, which functions as an EO in relation to food: the food-deprived organism will perform behaviors previously related to the acquisition of food more intensely, frequently, longer, or faster in the presence of food, and those behaviors would be especially strongly reinforced. For instance, a fast-food worker earning minimal wage, forced to work more than one job to make ends meet, would be highly motivated by a pay raise, because of the current deprivation of money (a conditioned establishing operation). The worker would work hard to try to achieve the raise, and getting the raise would function as an especially strong reinforcer of work behavior.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, a {{motivating}} {{operation that}} causes {{a decrease in}} the effectiveness of a reinforcer, or diminishes a <b>learned</b> <b>behavior</b> related to the reinforcer, functions as an abolishing operation, AO. Again using the example of food, satiation of food prior to the presentation of a food stimulus would produce a decrease on food-related behaviors, and diminish or completely abolish the reinforcing effect of acquiring and ingesting the food. Consider the board of a large investment bank, concerned with a too small profit margin, deciding to give the CEO a new incentive package in order to motivate him to increase firm profits. If the CEO already has a lot of money, the incentive package might not be a very good way to motivate him, because he would be satiated on money. Getting even more money wouldn't be a strong reinforcer for profit-increasing behavior, and wouldn't elicit increased intensity, frequency or duration of profit-increasing behavior.|$|E

Spence attributed improvement in performance to motivational factors rather than the habit factors of Hull’s theory. He believed that reinforcement was not always necessary for learning to occur and that people can learn through latent learning. He also developed a discrimination learning theory. His discrimination theory suggests that there are gradients of excitatory and inhibitory potential that are generated around the values of the stimulus that are either reinforced or not.|$|E

25|$|The {{frequency}} of physical aggression in humans peaks at around 2–3 years of age. It then declines gradually on average. These observations suggest that physical aggression {{is not only}} a <b>learned</b> <b>behavior</b> but that development provides opportunities for the learning and biological development of self-regulation. However, a small subset of children fail to acquire all the necessary self-regulatory abilities and tend to show atypical levels of physical aggression across development. These may be at risk for later violent behavior or, conversely, lack of aggression that may be considered necessary within society. Some findings suggest that early aggression does not necessarily lead to aggression later on, however, although the course through early childhood is an important predictor of outcomes in middle childhood. In addition, physical aggression that continues is likely occurring in the context of family adversity, including socioeconomic factors. Moreover, 'opposition' and 'status violations' in childhood appear to be more strongly linked to social problems in adulthood than simply aggressive antisocial behavior. Social learning through interactions in early childhood has been seen as a building block for levels of aggression which {{play a crucial role in}} the development of peer relationships in middle childhood. Overall, an interplay of biological, social and environmental factors can be considered.|$|E
