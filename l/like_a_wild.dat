25|$|Further, {{the missionaries}} were very wiser; they learned the {{situation}} of Lisu people culture so that the gospel may spread quickly. They used various kind of methods, they taught songs (hymns), they sent medicines and doctors, helped the needing people, and they provide funds for domestic missionaries and evangelists. They also helped in developing agriculture development too. So, the gospel was spread very quickly <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> fire. Church of Christ has been in growth.|$|E
25|$|Rex {{was very}} often {{the star of}} these films, {{bringing}} comedy and action to the screen. In one scene from No Man's Law, Rex saves the modesty {{of a young woman}} swimming in the nude from a pair of rowdy villains. Chasing one around in circles, rearing and bucking <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> mustang, until he finally runs him off of a cliff, he sneaks up behind the other and nudges him with his nose over the ledge and into the watering hole. He then nose prods the now clothed young woman back to her father.|$|E

25|$|Researchers {{concluded}} that, if Genie vocalized or {{made any}} other noise, her father beat {{her with a}} large plank he kept in her room. To keep her quiet he bared his teeth and barked and growled at her <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> dog, and grew his fingernails out to scratch her. If he suspected her of doing something {{he did not like}} he made these noises outside the door, and beat her if he believed she had continued to do it, instilling an intense and persistent fear of cats and dogs in Genie. No one definitively discerned the exact reason for his dog-like behavior, although at least one scientist speculated he may have viewed himself as a guard dog and was acting out the role. As a result, Genie learned to make as little sound as possible and to otherwise give no outward expressions. Genie developed a tendency to masturbate in socially inappropriate contexts, which led doctors to seriously consider the possibility that Genie's father subjected her to sexual abuse or forced her brother to do so, although they never uncovered any definite evidence.|$|E
500|$|Israel {{asserted}} {{that most of}} the damage had been caused in the two wars and during the artillery duels in between. Several reports from before the withdrawal did refer to the city as [...] "ruined" [...] and [...] "shell-scarred". The Times correspondent saw the city for himself on 6 May, a month before the Israeli withdrawal, and described it as being [...] "in ruins and deserted after seven years of war and dereliction. It looks <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> west city struck by an earthquake and if the Syrians get it back they will face a major feat of reconstruction. Nearly every building is heavily damaged and scores have collapsed." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{inspiration}} for [...] "Fight Club" [...] was a [...] "long-lost nugget" [...] that series creator Chris Carter had thought up a while back. He explained, [...] "I had this {{idea for a}} long time to do a story about mis-matched twins that had an almost nuclear reaction when they were around each other." [...] Carter began to write the episode at the same time as the pilot for the X-Files spin-off, The Lone Gunmen. Because of the [...] "insanity" [...] in juggling two scripts at once, many more [...] "crazy" [...] elements made it into [...] "Fight Club". When executive producer Frank Spotnitz first looked at the script, he noted that [...] " [...] had an odd tone. It felt <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> show." ...|$|E

500|$|Grim Fandango gained {{critical}} acclaim upon its release. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the game scores of 93% and 94/100. Critics lauded the art direction in particular, with GameSpot rating the visual design as [...] "consistently great". PC Zone emphasized the production {{as a whole}} calling the direction, costumes, characters, music, and atmosphere expertly done. They also commented the game would make a [...] "superb film". The San Francisco Chronicle stated [...] "Grim Fandango feels <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> dance through a cartoonish film-noir adventure. Its wacky characters, seductive puzzle-filled plot and a nearly invisible interface allow players to lose themselves in the game just as cinemagoers might get lost in a movie." [...] The Houston Chronicle, in naming Grim Fandango the best game of [...] along with Half-Life, complimented the graphics calling them [...] "jaw-dropping" [...] and commented that the game [...] "is full of both dark and light humor." [...] IGN summed its review up by saying the game was the [...] "best adventure game" [...] it had ever seen.|$|E
500|$|Soon, Shakira {{began work}} on her next studio album, titled She Wolf, which was, among other places, {{recorded}} at the Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Shakira said that specifically chose the studio after she learned that it had previously been used for recording sessions by artists like Bob Marley, The Cure, and AC/DC, of whom she is a fan. Unlike most of her previous projects, which are predominantly composed of Latin and pop rock styles, She Wolf is an electropop album with world music influences. When asked why the album had electronic influences, Shakira responded, [...] "I felt very curious and intrigued about the electro-pop world and everything it has to offer. I {{wanted to make sure}} that this album was very bassy and that the kicks hit really hard, and I wanted to concentrate on the beat. But my music, to a certain extent, is very complex– because I always try to experiment with sounds from other parts of the world." [...] Explaining the meaning behind the title, Shakira said that [...] "'She Wolf' is the woman of our time. The woman who knows what she wants and is free of prejudice and preconceived notions. She defends her deepest desires with teeth and claws <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> animal".|$|E
500|$|As {{part of the}} Mermaid Ball concert tour's setlist, [...] "Jumanji" [...] was {{performed}} several times on the aforementioned tour. Banks performed the song at the Bowery Ballroom on June 4, 2012, {{as part of her}} Mermaid Ball tour's setlist, with a pair of athletic backup dancers. Corban Goble of Stereogum criticized the use of dancers, inferring Banks [...] them, citing, [...] " [...] it was hard to notice them when they flanked Banks, such was the magnetism of Banks's onstage exercise". Goble also noted the crowd's reaction to the song, stating it [...] "elicited the a satisfied sigh of recognition from the audience when the first bars dropped". Ray Rahman of Entertainment Weekly praised the performance, saying, [...] "Things jumped off when she ripped into her Internet hit 'Jumanji'". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard opined that the performance [...] "thumped <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> animal". Another time the song {{was performed}} was, again, a part of the Mermaid Ball, at the Fonda Theatre on July 14, 2012. Ernest Hardy of the Los Angeles Times lauded the performance, comparing Banks's vocal delivery on both [...] "Jumanji" [...] and [...] "Esta Noche" [...] to that of Lil' Kim's. Hardy continued with his praise, citing, Banks was [...] "owning the crowd", and that her [...] "breath control was impeccable". Another performance of [...] "Jumanji" [...] was on October 13, 2012, at the Sea Life Centre London Aquarium in London. In an article about the show written for MTV UK's website, Emma Knock called the lyrics to the performance a [...] "real crowd pleaser", and noticed the crowd [...] "did their best to sing along to the likes of 'Jumanji'".|$|E

2500|$|The priesthood of the Arval Brothers {{called on}} Mars to drive off [...] "rust" [...] (lues), with its double meaning of wheat fungus {{and the red}} oxides that affect metal, a threat to both iron farm {{implements}} and weaponry.

2500|$|.....a strange madness {{came upon}} him. He crept away and {{fled to the}} woods, unwilling that any should see his going. Into the forest he went, glad to lie hidden beneath the ash trees.

He made use of the roots of plants and of grasses, of fruit from trees and of the blackberries in the thicket. He became a Man of the Woods, as if dedicated to the woods. So for a whole summer he stayed hidden in the woods, discovered by none, forgetful of himself and of his own, lurking <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> thing.|$|E

They are not at all such as we describe them when we relate that they let themselves be captured by virgins, but clean contrary to our notions." [...] It is clear that Marco Polo was describing a rhinoceros. In German, since the 16th century, Einhorn ("one-horn") has become a descriptor of the various species of rhinoceros.|$|E
