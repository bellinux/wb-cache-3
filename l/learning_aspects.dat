50|$|While {{simulations}} {{are used}} for learning and training purposes, noted authors, such as Clark Aldrich and Andy Gibbons (Model-Centered Instruction) suggest that simulations {{in and of themselves}} are not instructional. Rather, a simulation only becomes instructional when instructional elements are included that help expose the learner to key parts or concepts of the system or environment. For example, an F-16 simulator is not inherently instructional because it is primarily intended to replicate the F-16 cockpit behavior and the environments the aircraft operates within. The simulator may be used for training purposes, but it requires an instructor or some other external element to identify key <b>learning</b> <b>aspects</b> of the system to the learner.|$|E

5000|$|Integrated {{curricula}} like {{teaching for}} 3S understanding {{are becoming more}} popular all around the world. The article [...] "Japan's National Curriculum Reforms: Focus on Integrated Curriculum" [...] was {{an excellent source of}} information on curriculum infusion. It was geared toward helping to implement the integration into school systems. Japan wanted their children {{to grow up to be}} well-balanced adults. This article provided excellent insight into why the basic standards are not enough anymore. Arani says:On this basis, the optional courses increase; the teacher’s role changes; and the school should teach the students how to think, decide, and organize their thoughts, as well as how to gain the skills for learning, research, and collection and analysis of data. The school should also teach the students how to learn while being in contact with their surroundings, and how to relate all the learning with the society, and the daily life. Children need to learn to think more independently. They need to be able to understand what is happening around them in their environment. The rich culture all around them needs to be coupled with the problems and issues around them as well. Japan has realized and acted on the realization that basic knowledge base curriculum does not work anymore. The world is a changing place and teachers need to integrate the world into their students’ educations. It relates to the self and social <b>learning</b> <b>aspects</b> of 3S understanding that help set it apart. This is an excellent example of the democratic self and social understanding discussed by Henderson.|$|E

Leveraging on IT, blended learning is an approach which {{takes advantage of}} the best that both the classroom and online learning can provide. To help institutions of higher learning (IHLs) improve their understanding of how students view blended learning and formulate a strategy to successfully implement blended learning, the main objective {{of this paper is to}} examine how the attitude of students towards different <b>learning</b> <b>aspects</b> could influence their readiness for blended learning. We conceptualized six <b>learning</b> <b>aspects</b> in a research model and then collected responses from 201 full-time undergraduate students to validate the model. Analyses revealed three key findings. First, the use of technology in education was not a hindrance to the students. Second, blended learning adaptability, which was modelled as a second-order formative construct and formed by four first-order reflective constructs — attitude towards online learning, study management, online interaction, and learning flexibility — had a positive relationship with student readiness for blended learning. Third, attitude towards classroom learning had a negative relationship with student readiness for blended learning. An understanding of student attitude towards different <b>learning</b> <b>aspects</b> can be critical in the assessment of student readiness for blended learning, which is a prerequisite for successful implementation of blended learning...|$|E
