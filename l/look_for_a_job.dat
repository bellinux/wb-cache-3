He moved to Minot, North Dakota and purchased a 100-year-old, flood-damaged home that he is restoring himself. He {{took a job at}} KS Industries, an oil field construction firm. Initially crewing a hydro excavation truck, he went through a driver's training program and later began managing the crews of six other trucks. He currently works as a field safety specialist for KS Industries. His exploits during the firefight were later written about by journalist Jake Tapper in his book, The Outpost.|$|E

25|$|On August 30, 1940, The Second Vienna Award {{returned}} Kolozsvár to Hungary's control. The city's Jews {{were happy}} at first, reasoning that Hungary's Jews {{had not been}} subjected to the same random killings experienced by Jews in Romania. Hungarian Jews were patriots, seeing themselves as Hungarians first, Jews second, and Hungary as their homeland, not Eretz Israel. Their jubilation was short-lived. As Germany's influence over Hungarian policies increased, Jews found themselves subjected to antisemitic legislation and violence. In 1941, the Hungarian government closed all Jewish newspapers, including Új Kelet. Kastner, then 36 years old, {{decided to move to}} Budapest to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>job,</b> leaving his wife behind in Kolozsvár.|$|E

25|$|The {{unemployment}} benefit should be increased and {{limited to one}} year. In this period, people would have to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> or education. If {{at the end of}} the year one should not succeed in finding a job, the government will offer one a job for the minimum wage. In order to create more employment, they want to implement the green tax shift which will lower taxes on lower paid labour. This would be compensated by higher taxes on pollution. In order to increase prospects for the underprivileged, it wants to invest in education, especially the vmbo (middle-level vocational education). In order to ensure that migrants have a better chance for jobs, it wants to deal firmly with discrimination, especially on the labour market. The party wants to decrease income differences by making child benefits. The party favours reform of government pensions: after 45 years of employment one should get the right to a pension. If one starts working young, one is able to stop working earlier than if one starts working when one is older. Receiving unemployment or disability benefits is counted as work, as is caring for children or family members. The system of mortgage interest deductions should be abolished over a forty-year period.|$|E
500|$|Ayola {{has since}} {{explained}} that her {{change of heart}} stemmed from becoming a mother. In {{the early years of}} her marriage to fellow actor Adam Smethurst the couple struggled financially, and with the added expense of the birth of their daughter, Ayola had been on the verge of giving up her acting career to begin a business franchise. [...] On joining the cast of Holby City, she disclosed: [...] "I've been someone who's loved the uncertainty of acting. I've loved that one month it's Sahara in Morocco and the next I'm doing a stage play, then it's a six-part telly thing. But last summer I started thinking it would be really nice not to have to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> every couple of weeks. It would be nice just to stay put for a while. If I'm going to be a working mum I'd rather just be one rather than be one intermittently. And then Holby came along, so I'm very grateful." ...|$|E

She had {{previously}} appeared in Holby City sister show Casualty, {{and had made}} an appearance in Holby City fifth series as patient Marianne Lawson. She was approached about returning to the show in a more permanent role by BBC casting director Julie Harkin. After {{a series of three}} meetings, a year after the birth of her first child, she agreed to assume the role of Kyla, despite being [...] "nervous about signing such a long contract", stating: [...] "I've been someone who's loved the uncertainty of acting.

6000|$|Those {{early days}} in California brought out character. It {{was a long way}} off then, and the journey was expensive. The {{fortunate}} could go by Cape Horn or by the Isthmus of Panama; but the mass of pioneers crossed the plains with their ox-teams. This took an entire summer. They were very lucky when they got through with a yoke of worn-out cattle. All other means were exhausted in procuring the outfit on the Missouri River. The immigrant, on arriving, found himself a stranger, in a strange land, far from friends. Time pressed, for the little means that could be realized from the sale of {{what was left of the}} outfit would not support a man long at California prices. Many became discouraged. Others would take off their coats and <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>job,</b> no matter what it might be. These succeeded as a rule. There were many young men who had studied professions before they went to California, and who had never done a day's manual labor in their lives, who took in the situation at once and went to work to make a start at anything they could get to do. Some supplied carpenters and masons with material--carrying plank, brick, or mortar, as the case might be; others drove stages, drays, or baggage wagons, until they could do better. More became discouraged early and spent their time looking up people who would [...] "treat," [...] or lounging about restaurants and gambling houses where free lunches were furnished daily. They were welcomed at these places because they often brought in miners who proved good customers.|$|E
