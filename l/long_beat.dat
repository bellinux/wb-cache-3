60|$|The day bade fair {{to be rich}} in experience. Jerry, the foreman, was patrolling his <b>long</b> <b>beat</b> up {{and down}} the highway. Jerry carried a shot-gun and looked like a sentry.

60|$|The life-buoy--a long slender cask--was {{dropped from}} the stern, where it always hung obedient to a cunning spring; but no hand rose to seize it, and the sun having <b>long</b> <b>beat</b> upon this cask it had shrunken, so that it slowly filled, and the parched wood also filled at its every pore; and the studded iron-bound cask {{followed}} the sailor to the bottom, as if to yield him his pillow, though in sooth but a hard one.|$|E
60|$|At length Pine was {{apparently}} a deserted village, except for Las Vegas, who patrolled his <b>long</b> <b>beat</b> in many ways--he lounged while he watched; he stalked like a mountaineer; he stole along Indian fashion, stealthily, {{from tree to}} tree, from corner to corner; he disappeared in the saloon to reappear at the back; he slipped round behind the barns to come out again in the main road; and time after time he approached his horse as if deciding to mount.|$|E
60|$|The centre-board {{made him}} anxious. He gave over playing with me, and {{started on the}} <b>long</b> <b>beat</b> to Vallejo. To my joy, on the first long tack across, I found that I could eat into the wind {{just a little bit}} closer than he. Here was where another man in the boat would have been of value to him; for, with me but a few feet astern, he did not dare let go the tiller and run {{amidships}} to try to force down the centre-board.|$|E

60|$|Years ago, when I {{was very}} small, {{we lived in}} a great house in a long, straight, brown-coloured street, in the east end of London. It was a noisy, crowded street in the daytime; but a silent, lonesome street at night, when the gas-lights, few and far between, partook of the {{character}} of lighthouses rather than of illuminants, and the tramp, tramp of the policeman on his <b>long</b> <b>beat</b> seemed to be ever drawing nearer, or fading away, except for brief moments when the footsteps ceased, as he paused to rattle a door or window, or to flash his lantern into some dark passage leading down towards the river.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{there was}} a {{bookkeeper}} when I was sixteen. I seem to run to bookkeepers. It was a bookkeeper at the laundry that Charley <b>Long</b> <b>beat</b> up. This other one was when I was working in Hickmeyer's Cannery. He had soft hands, too. But I quickly got all I wanted of him. He was... well, anyway, he had ideas like your boss. And I never really did love him, truly and honest, Billy. I felt from the first that he wasn't just right. And when I {{was working in the}} paper-box factory I thought I loved a clerk in Kahn's Emporium--you know, on Eleventh and Washington. He was all right. That was the trouble with him. He was too much all right. He didn't have any life in him, any go. He wanted to marry me, though. But somehow I couldn't see it. That shows I didn't love him. He was narrow-chested and skinny, and his hands were always cold and fishy. But my! he could dress--just like he came out of a bandbox. He {{said he was going to}} drown himself, and all kinds of things, but I broke with him just the same.|$|E
60|$|Martin did not laugh; {{nor did he}} grit {{his teeth}} in anger. The effect {{produced}} upon him was one of great sadness. In the crash of his whole world, with love on the pinnacle, the crash of magazinedom and the dear public was a small crash indeed. Brissenden had been wholly right in his judgment of the magazines, and he, Martin, had spent arduous and futile years {{in order to find}} it out for himself. The magazines were all Brissenden had said they were and more. Well, he was done, he solaced himself. He had hitched his wagon to a star and been landed in a pestiferous marsh. The visions of Tahiti--clean, sweet Tahiti--were coming to him more frequently. And there were the low Paumotus, and the high Marquesas; he saw himself often, now, on board trading schooners or frail little cutters, slipping out at dawn through the reef at Papeete and beginning the <b>long</b> <b>beat</b> through the pearl-atolls to Nukahiva and the Bay of Taiohae, where Tamari, he knew, would kill a pig in honor of his coming, and where Tamari's flower-garlanded daughters would seize his hands and with song and laughter garland him with flowers. The South Seas were calling, and he knew that sooner or later he would answer the call.|$|E
60|$|The dinner-gong {{began to}} sound, and as though {{attracted}} by its <b>long</b> monotonous <b>beating,</b> a swallow flew in {{at one of}} the narrow windows and fluttered round the room. Mrs. Pendyce's eyes followed its flight.|$|R

6000|$|It really blows on San Francisco Bay. During the winter, {{which is}} the best {{cruising}} season, we have southeasters, southwesters, and occasional howling northers. Throughout the summer we have what we call the [...] "sea- breeze," [...] an unfailing wind off the Pacific that on most afternoons in the week blows what the Atlantic Coast yachtsmen would name a gale. They are always surprised by the small spread of canvas our yachts carry. Some of them, with schooners they have sailed around the Horn, have looked proudly at their own lofty sticks and huge spreads, then patronisingly and even pityingly at ours. Then, perchance, they have joined in a club cruise from San Francisco to Mare Island. They found the morning run up the Bay delightful. In the afternoon, when the brave west wind ramped across San Pablo Bay and they faced it on the <b>long</b> <b>beat</b> home, things were somewhat different. One by one, like a flight of swallows, our more meagrely sparred and canvassed yachts went by, leaving them wallowing and dead and shortening down in what they called a gale but which we called a dandy sailing breeze. The next time they came out, we would notice their sticks cut down, their booms shortened, and their after-leeches nearer the luffs by whole cloths.|$|E
60|$|Men, who are of one blood with sheep, have {{followed}} {{their friends and}} the railway along the river valleys where the towns are. Across the hills the inhabitants are few, and, outside their State, little known. They withdraw from society in November if they live on the uplands, coming down in May as the snow gives leave. Not {{much more than a}} generation ago these farms made their own clothes, soap, and candles, and killed their own meat thrice a year, beef, veal, and pig, and sat still between-times. Now they buy shop-made clothes, patent soaps, and kerosene; and it is among their tents that the huge red and gilt Biographies of Presidents, and the twenty-pound family Bibles, with illuminated marriage-registers, mourning-cards, baptismal certificates, and hundreds of genuine steel-engravings, sell best. Here, too, off the main-travelled roads, the wandering quack--Patent Electric Pills, nerve cures, etc.--divides the field with the seed and fruit man and the seller of cattle-boluses. They dose themselves a good deal, I fancy, for it is a poor family that does not know all about nervous prostration. So the quack drives a pair of horses and a gaily-painted waggon with a hood, and sometimes takes his wife with him. Once only have I met a pedlar afoot. He was an old man, shaken with palsy, and he pushed a thing exactly like a pauper's burial-cart, selling pins, tape, scents, and flavourings. You helped yourself, for his hands had no direction, and he told a long tale in which the deeding away of a farm to one of his family was mixed up with pride at the distances he still could cover daily. As much as six miles sometimes. He was no Lear, as the gift of the farm might suggest, but sealed of the tribe of the Wandering Jew--a tremulous old giddy-gaddy. There are many such rovers, gelders of colts and the like, who work a <b>long</b> <b>beat,</b> south to Virginia almost, and north to the frontier, paying with talk and gossip for their entertainment.|$|E

5000|$|This is {{the first}} film {{produced}} by GraÃ§a Filmes, [...] "Destiny Road" [...] also pioneered the debut scale never achieved by an evangelical film in Brazil (51 theaters).
