For example, we may take the whole business on the plane of the medical man, ignoring all other considerations. On that plane it would probably be almost easy to reason out a working system. It never has been done by the medical profession, as a whole, which is fairly understandable, or by any group of medical men, which is the more surprising, but it would be an extremely interesting thing to have done and a material contribution to the sane discussion of this problem. It would not solve it but it would illuminate certain aspects. Let the mere physiological problem be taken. We want healthy children and the best we can get. Let the medical man devise his scheme primarily for that. Understand we are shutting our eyes to every other consideration but physical or quasi- physical ones. Imagine the thing done, for example, by a Mr. Francis Galton, who had an absolutely open mind upon all other questions. Some form of polygamy, marriage of the most transient description, with reproduction barred to specified types, would probably come from such a speculation. But, in addition, {{a number of people who}} can have only a few children or none are, nevertheless, not adapted physiologically for celibacy. Conceive the medical man working that problem out upon purely materialistic lines and with an eye to all physiological and pathological peculiarities.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for comparing {{the shapes of}} tetrameric proteins whose three-dimensional structure is known. The centres of mass of single subunits are calculated as Cartesian co-ordinates {{with respect to their}} three dyad axes. The axes are allocated {{on the basis of the}} extent of the intersubunit contacts that they relate. This results in the division of proteins into two classes called right-handed and left-handed. A second division, which also contains right-handed and left-handed forms, is made according to the distances between the centres of mass of the subunits measured across the two axes with the most extensive contacts. Two other parameters have been calculated from the coordinates; they are named "aplanarity" and "twist". The eight tetramers so far investigated are discussed. One, lactate dehydrogenase, cannot be treated in this way. Among the others, right-handed structures (according to both definitions) are found to be commoner; most have low twist; all are of fairly high aplanarity except phosphoglycerate mutase.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{parameters}} of a vertical arc for the ILC Low Emittance Transport (LET) are reviewed. A 1 TeV CM ILC which relies upon 30 MV/m accelerating cavities with a packing fraction of 65 % will require almost 48 km of main linac, {{which suggests that}} the total site length including BDS and bunch compressors will be on the order of 53 km. If built in a laser-straight tunnel with the low-energy ends near the surface, and assuming a perfectly spherical ''cue ball'' planetary surface with radius 6370 km, the collider halls will necessarily be 55 meters below grade, as shown in the top plot of Figure 1. Such depths would demand extensive use of deep tunneling, which would potentially drive up the cost and difficulty of ILC construction. An alternate solution is to use discrete vertical arcs at a few locations to allow a ''piecewise straight'' construction in which the depth of the tunnel below grade does not vary by more than a few meters. This approach is shown schematically in the bottom plot of Figure 1. In this Note we consider the issues for a design with one such vertical arc at the 250 GeV/c point (ie, midway down the linac for 1 TeV CM), and a second arc {{at the entrance to the}} BDS (ie, the entire BDS <b>lies</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>plane,</b> with vertical arcs at each end) ...|$|R

Briefly, the fibrous ring to which the cusps of the mitral valve are attached does not <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>plane</b> as shown in standard textbooks, and conse-quently the relationship of the anterior, aortic, or septal cusp of the valve to the left atrium, and to the inflow and outflow channels of the left ventricle, is not that which would be inferred if the ring were in one plane. The fibrous ring, part of the framework of the heart, which separates atrium from ventricle, and to which the cusps of the mitral valve are attached, consists, in its superomedial part, of the borders of the right and left fibrous trigones, and the fibrous wall of the subaortic part of the left ventri-cular chamber with which they are continuous.

The first method employed {{consisted of a}} swirl chamber, which produced axisymmetric jets with a tangential velocity component.

In the second method, the nozzle exit plane of the cylindrical chamber was perturbed such that the nozzle's exit lip was not <b>lying</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>plane</b> perpendicular to the axis of symmetry of the nozzle. These two methods were investigated experimentally via spark Schlieren photography, static, Pitot and sound pressure measurements.

Static and pitot pressure measurements were carried out to obtain the velocity distribution whereas sound pressure measurements were used to determine the resulting gain in noise reduction. The introduction of a small flow rotation was found to weaken the internal shock strength and to reduce the cell length and screech noise generated. Increasing the flow rotation beyond a certain limit was found to effect the shock structure without any noticeable noise reduction. Sinusoidal perturbation was found to affect the symmetry and strength of the oblique shocks in the supersonic cells. A considerable noise reduction was also noted with perturbation amplitude equal to 12. 5 % of the nozzle inside diameter. Larger perturbation did not result in a further noise reduction.

Due to the crystalline structure of the samples and the affine invariance of the basic problem it turns out that it is mostly enough to consider subsets of the integer lattice.

The approach created reveals a hidden symmetry of spatial electronic structure which, in general, does not coincide with the symmetry of a visible atomic structure.

40|$|Reflected light {{microscopy}} of biological material {{has been a}} very difficult task and many different but hardly successful {{attempts have been made to}} get usable images. The main reasons for this state are: weak reflections from the biologically important structures in the object as against strong reflection at its surface; reflections at optical surfaces in the microscope which cause a deterioration of contrast; and the mixing together of reflections from many levels in the object so that the signal coming from the focussed-on level is lost in noise and d. c. components. We tried, and successfully, to reverse this situation and to make it possible for the signal to overwhelm spurious and scattered light using double, or, as we call it, tandem scanning. The object is illuminated only <b>in</b> small patches <b>lying</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>plane</b> and moving across this plane and only the light reflected from these illuminated patches is allowed to pass into the image plane and participate in image formation. The image consists of points which travel over the image plane and which are geometrical images of the illuminated patches in the focussed-on object plane. To ensure that only the light belonging to these geometrical images be allowed to enter the image, the image plane is covered with an opaque diaphragm having holes in locations exactly corresponding to the locations of the geometrical images of the illuminated object points; this diaphragm travels in concordance with the first scanning and so the complete image of the focussed-on object plane is formed successively. Both scans are performed by a single device, a Nip-kow disc carrying in its annular periphery several ten thousands of holes arranged in Archimedean spirals. The disc is 100 mm in diameter and rotates about 100 rpm driven by an electric motor. On one side the disc is illuminated in a circle 18 mm in diameter, and the light transmitted through several hundred holes and reflected in a mirror system passes a microscope objective which forms the images of the disc holes in the object plane. The light reflected here passes through the same objective and mirror system (one mirror being a 'limitlessly thin* beam splitter) to pass conjugate aperture holes on the observation side of the Nipkow disc. As the disc lies at the intermediate image plane of the objective lens on both its illuminating and observation sides, only light emanating from reflection or fluorescence in the plane of focus can contribute to the image. High contrast images of very thin focussed-on layers are thus formed. The practical arrangements are such that very large specimens can be examined: the specimens for this microscope need not themselves be microscopic...|$|R
30|$|The trap {{could also}} be used to examine {{different}} types of quantum motional effects of ions, similar to the recent work on the Aharonov-Bohm effect [26]. In order to examine such effects, one would need to cool the system to nearly the ground state. This can be accomplished by including Raman side-band cooling after Doppler cooling the system for all modes except the soft rotational mode, at least when the potential is large enough that the mode frequencies are sizeable. To cool the rotational mode, one would need to add a perturbation to the system that lifts the phonon mode frequency, side-band cool it, and then adiabatically reduce the frequency by removing the perturbation. This procedure will cool off that phonon mode, which can yield quite small quanta in it [26]. Once the system has been prepared in this state, then quantum tunneling effects, or coherent motional effects could be studied in the trap for a range of different ion configurations. It might also be interesting to extend these types of studies to cases where the ions no longer <b>lie</b> completely <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>plane,</b> but have deformed into a full three-dimensional structure (as long as the larger micromotion does not cause problems). Finally, many of these ideas would need to be used if one tried to examine time crystals, especially the cooling of the rotational mode {{to be able to see}} quantum effects [27, 28].|$|R

These two types of rings may be either free or supported in various ways (pinned-fixed, locally clamped, elastic-foundation supported, mounting-bracket supported, etc.). The initial geometry of each ring may be circular or arbitrarily curved; uniform-thickness or variable-thickness rings may be analyzed. Strain-hardening and strain-rate effects of initially-isotropic material are taken into account. An approximate analysis utilizing kinetic energy and momentum conservation relations is used to predict the after-impact velocities of each fragment and of the impact-affected region of the ring; this procedure is termed the collision-imparted velocity method (CIVM) and is used in the CIVM-JET 5 B program. This imparted-velocity information is used in conjunction with a finite-element structural response computation code to predict the transient, large-deflection, elastic-plastic responses of the ring. Similarly, the equations of motion of each fragment are solved in small steps in time. Provisions are made in the CIVM-JET 5 B code to analyze structural ring response to impact attack by from 1 to 3 fragments, each with its own size, mass, translational velocity components, and rotational velocity.

40|$|In the {{currently}} most probable {{model of the}} formation of structure in the universe, clumps of dark matter, called halos, form from local concentrations of matter in the early universe and merge to form larger structures, such as galaxy-sized or galaxy cluster-sized halos. Inside these halos, galaxies can form. Smaller halos that have entered a larger halo are called subhalos and can host satellite galaxies. The nearby spiral galaxy Andromeda (M 31) could have been the result of a major merger in the past. We see the M 31 's stellar disk edge-on. This disk determines the plain of the possible major merger and material could have been liberated by this merger and ejected toward the Milky Way (MW). Many satellite galaxies of the MW <b>lie</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> single <b>plane</b> through the center of our galaxy, which could be explained by the in fall of a group of satellites (possibly originating from M 31). We have used the Cosmogrid cosmological Λ cold dark matter computer simulation to find 47 instances of pairs of halos that resemble the Local Group (LG; consisting of the MW's and M 31 's halos and their environment) and searched for subhalos contained in either the MW or M 31 at the present time (the latest simulation output) that have been a subhalo of the other halo at an earlier time. We call such a subhalo a renegade. It is found that most (27 out of all 47) LG-like pairs do not exhibit a single renegade and those that do contain a renegade population that accounts for up to 7. 25 % of the total subhalo population. Renegade subhalos have on average a higher velocity than other subhalos, but the distribution in mass for renegades and all subhalos do not differ much. Due to this higher velocity, most renegades are not bound to the halo they are contained in...|$|R
