5|$|Cerium has {{no known}} {{biological}} role in humans, {{but is not}} very toxic either; it does not accumulate in the food chain to any appreciable extent. Because it often occurs together with calcium in phosphate minerals, and bones are primarily calcium phosphate, cerium can accumulate in bones in small amounts that are not considered dangerous. Cerium, like the other lanthanides, is known to affect human metabolism, lowering cholesterol levels, blood pressure, appetite, and risk of blood coagulation. Cerium nitrate is an effective topical antimicrobial treatment for third-degree burns, although <b>large</b> <b>doses</b> can lead to cerium poisoning and methemoglobinemia. The early lanthanides act as essential cofactors for the methanol dehydrogenase of the methanotrophic bacterium Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, for which lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, and neodymium alone are about equally effective.|$|E

However, excess catecholamine may induce cardiac dysfunction and ß-adrenergic desensitization. While magnesium {{is known to be}} a cardioprotective agent, its beneficial effects on acute cardiac dysfunction remain to be elucidated. We examined the effects of magnesium on left ventricular (LV) dysfunction induced by a <b>large</b> <b>dose</b> of isoproterenol (ISO) in dogs. Sixteen anesthetized dogs underwent a continuous infusion of ISO (1 Ag/kg/min) with or without a magnesium infusion (1 mg/kg/min). The dose-response to small doses of ISO (0. 025 - 0. 2 Ag/kg/min) was tested hourly. A <b>large</b> <b>dose</b> of ISO decreased LV systolic function, increased tau, and suppressed the dose-response to small doses of ISO in a time dependent manner. Magnesium significantly attenuated ISO-induced LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and preserved the dose-response to ISO. Serum ionized calcium significantly decreased with a <b>large</b> <b>dose</b> of ISO, but was fully maintained at baseline level with magnesium. A <b>large</b> <b>dose</b> of ISO increased serum lipid peroxide levels and serological markers of myocardial damage, which were significantly suppressed by magnesium.

5|$|In rodents and primates, {{sufficiently}} {{high doses}} of amphetamine cause dopaminergic neurotoxicity, or damage to dopamine neurons, which is characterized by dopamine terminal degeneration and reduced transporter and receptor function. There {{is no evidence that}} amphetamine is directly neurotoxic in humans. However, <b>large</b> <b>doses</b> of amphetamine may indirectly cause dopaminergic neurotoxicity as a result of hyperpyrexia, the excessive formation of reactive oxygen species, and increased autoxidation of dopamine. Animal models of neurotoxicity from high-dose amphetamine exposure indicate that the occurrence of hyperpyrexia (i.e., core body temperature≥40°C) is necessary for the development of amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity. Prolonged elevations of brain temperature above 40°C likely promote the development of amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity in laboratory animals by facilitating the production of reactive oxygen species, disrupting cellular protein function, and transiently increasing blood–brain barrier permeability.|$|E
5|$|Like all rare-earth metals, cerium is of low to {{moderate}} toxicity. A strong reducing agent, it ignites spontaneously in air at 65 to 80°C. Fumes from cerium fires are toxic. Water {{should not be}} used to stop cerium fires, as cerium reacts with water to produce hydrogen gas. Workers exposed to cerium have experienced itching, sensitivity to heat, and skin lesions. Cerium is not toxic when eaten, but animals injected with <b>large</b> <b>doses</b> of cerium have died due to cardiovascular collapse. Cerium is more dangerous to aquatic organisms, on account of being damaging to cell membranes, but this is not an important risk because it is not very soluble in water.|$|E

40|$|Dairy Research, 2014 {{is known}} as Dairy Day, 2014 Three {{experiments}} were conducted {{to determine if a}} <b>larger</b> <b>dose</b> of prostaglandin F 2 α (PG) administered on day 6 of a 5 -day Ovsynch timed artificial insemination (AI) program would induce regression of the corpus luteum to facilitate AI and pregnancy outcomes similar to a traditional 5 -day program with two doses of PG. When applying a 5 -day program, cows that ovulate in response to the first GnRH injection have a new corpus luteum (CL) that is 2 days younger when PG is administered in a 5 - versus 7 -day program. To regress successfully the younger CL, a second injection of PG must be given 24 hours after the first PG injection to prevent reduced pregnancy rate after the timed AI. These experiments demonstrated that administering 50 mg PG (10 mL Lutalyse) on day 6 produced luteolysis as efficiently as 25 mg PG (5 mL Lutalyse) administered on days 5 and 6 when the cut point for progesterone was 1 ng/mL 72 hours after the first PG injection or 48 hours after the <b>larger</b> PG <b>dose.</b> In contrast, when the cut point was 0. 5 ng/mL, the <b>larger</b> <b>dose</b> of PG was less effective. Pregnancy outcomes in cows did not differ between treatment doses except in one herd (Exp. 3). Although pregnancy outcomes were reduced only in one herd with the <b>larger</b> PG <b>dose,</b> this difference may be confounded with the earlier injection of the second GnRH injection 16 hours before timed AI, rather than failure of luteolysis in response to the <b>larger</b> <b>dose</b> of PG. Delaying the timing of AI, injection of the second GnRH, or both may be warranted to allow sufficient time for progesterone to decrease to basal concentrations in response to a <b>larger</b> <b>dose</b> of PG on day 6 to prevent a reduction in fertility...|$|R

5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of selenosis include a garlic odor on the breath, gastrointestinal disorders, hair loss, sloughing of nails, fatigue, irritability, and neurological damage. Extreme cases of selenosis can exhibit cirrhosis of the liver, pulmonary edema, or death. Elemental selenium and most metallic selenides have relatively low toxicities because of low bioavailability. By contrast, selenates and selenites have an oxidant mode of action {{similar to that of}} arsenic trioxide and are very toxic. The chronic toxic dose of selenite for humans is about 2400 to 3000 micrograms of selenium per day. Hydrogen selenide is an extremely toxic, corrosive gas. Selenium also occurs in organic compounds, such as dimethyl selenide, selenomethionine, selenocysteine and methylselenocysteine, all of which have high bioavailability and are toxic in <b>large</b> <b>doses.</b>|$|E
5|$|Titanium is {{non-toxic}} even in <b>large</b> <b>doses</b> {{and does}} not play any natural role inside the human body. An estimated quantity of 0.8 milligrams of titanium is ingested by humans each day, but most passes through without being absorbed in the tissues. It does, however, sometimes bio-accumulate in tissues that contain silica. One study indicates a possible connection between titanium and yellow nail syndrome. An unknown mechanism in plants may use titanium to stimulate the production of carbohydrates and encourage growth. This may explain why most plants contain about 1 part per million (ppm) of titanium, food plants have about 2 ppm, and horsetail and nettle contain up to 80 ppm.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{should not}} be taken by people who are {{allergic}} to ibuprofen or naproxen, or who have salicylate intolerance or a more generalized drug intolerance to NSAIDs, and caution should be exercised in those with asthma or NSAID-precipitated bronchospasm. Owing to its effect on the stomach lining, manufacturers recommend people with peptic ulcers, mild diabetes, or gastritis seek medical advice before using aspirin. Even if none of these conditions is present, the risk of stomach bleeding is still increased when aspirin is taken with alcohol or warfarin. People with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other salicylates. Aspirin is known to cause hemolytic anemia in people who have the genetic disease glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, particularly in <b>large</b> <b>doses</b> and depending on the severity of the disease. Use of aspirin during dengue fever is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency. People with kidney disease, hyperuricemia, or gout should not take aspirin because it inhibits the kidneys' ability to excrete uric acid, thus may exacerbate these conditions. Aspirin {{should not be}} given to children or adolescents to control cold or influenza symptoms, as this has been linked with Reye's syndrome.|$|E

5|$|Regarding Hall's fate, the {{official}} investigation that followed ruled {{the cause of}} death was apoplexy (an early term for stroke). Some of Hall's symptoms— partial paralysis, slurred speech, delirium— certainly fit that diagnosis. Indeed, the pains that Hall complained about down one side of his body, which he attributed to many years' huddling in an igloo, may have been due to a previous minor stroke. However, in 1968, Hall's biographer Chauncey C. Loomis, a professor at Dartmouth College, made an expedition to Greenland to exhume Hall's body. Because of the permafrost, Hall's body, flag shroud, clothing and coffin were remarkably well-preserved. Tests on tissue samples of bone, fingernails and hair showed that Hall had received <b>large</b> <b>doses</b> of arsenic in the last two weeks of his life. Arsenic poisoning appears consistent with the symptoms party members reported: stomach pains, vomiting, stupor, and mania. Arsenic can have a sweet taste, and Hall had complained that the coffee had tasted too sweet, and had burned his stomach. It also appears that at least three of the crew, Budington, Meyer, and Bessels, expressed relief at Hall's death and said that the expedition would be better off without him. In his book The Arctic Grail, Pierre Berton suggests that it is possible that Hall accidentally dosed himself with the poison, as arsenic was common in medical kits of the time. But it is considered more probable that he was murdered by one of the other members of the expedition, possibly Bessels, who was in nearly constant attendance of Hall. No charges were ever filed.|$|E
5|$|Management {{is based}} {{primarily}} on stopping the usage of the precipitating drugs, the administration of serotonin antagonists such as cyproheptadine, and supportive care including the control of agitation, the control of autonomic instability, and the control of hyperthermia. Additionally, those who ingest <b>large</b> <b>doses</b> of serotonergic agents may benefit from gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal {{if it can be}} administered within an hour of overdose. The intensity of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms. If the symptoms are mild, treatment may only consist of discontinuation of the offending medication or medications, offering supportive measures, giving benzodiazepines for myoclonus, and waiting for the symptoms to resolve. Moderate cases should have all thermal and cardiorespiratory abnormalities corrected and can benefit from serotonin antagonists. The serotonin antagonist cyproheptadine is the recommended initial therapy, although there have been no controlled trials demonstrating its efficacy for serotonin syndrome. Despite the absence of controlled trials, {{there are a number of}} case reports detailing apparent improvement after people have been administered cyproheptadine. Animal experiments also suggest a benefit from serotonin antagonists. Cyproheptadine is only available as tablets and therefore can only be administered orally or via a nasogastric tube; it is unlikely to be effective in people administered activated charcoal and has limited use in severe cases. Additional pharmacological treatment for severe case includes administering atypical antipsychotic drugs with serotonin antagonist activity such as olanzapine. Critically ill people should receive the above therapies as well as sedation or neuromuscular paralysis. People who have autonomic instability such as low blood pressure require treatment with direct-acting sympathomimetics such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, or phenylephrine. Conversely, hypertension or tachycardia can be treated with short-acting antihypertensive drugs such as nitroprusside or esmolol; longer acting drugs such as propranolol should be avoided as they may lead to hypotension and shock. The cause of serotonin toxicity or accumulation is an important factor in determining the course of treatment. Serotonin is catabolized by monoamine oxidase in the presence of oxygen, so if care is taken to prevent an unsafe spike in body temperature or metabolic acidosis, oxygenation will assist in dispatching the excess serotonin. The same principle applies to alcohol intoxication. In cases of serotonin syndrome caused by monoamine oxidase inhibitors oxygenation will not help to dispatch serotonin. In such instances, hydration is the main concern until the enzyme is regenerated.|$|E
