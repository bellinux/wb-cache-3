5|$|Most of {{the boys}} at St. Mary's played {{baseball}} in organized leagues {{at different levels of}} proficiency. Ruth later estimated that he played 200 games a year as he steadily climbed the ladder of success. Although he played all positions {{at one time or another}} (including infield positions generally reserved for right-handers), he gained stardom as a pitcher. According to Brother Matthias, Ruth was standing to one side <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bumbling pitching efforts of fellow students, and Matthias told him to go in and see if he could do better. Ruth had become the best pitcher at St. Mary's, and when he was 18 in 1913, he was allowed to leave the premises to play weekend games on teams that were drawn from the community. He was mentioned in several newspaper articles, for both his pitching prowess and ability to hit long home runs.|$|E
5|$|As a joke {{mirroring}} Cartman's, one of {{the girls}} at school queefs on Butters' face, causing him to run screaming and crying out of the school building. The other boys are shocked and their fathers, outraged, go to the Colorado General Assembly and demand a law banning queefing, much to the anger of the town's women. Meanwhile, the Queef Sisters appear on Regis and Kelly to promote their book Eat, Pray, Queef, and Terrance and Philip's show gets canceled due to the rising popularity of the Queef Sisters. Terrance and Philip attempt to kill the Queef Sisters, but the plan backfires when they end up becoming attracted to them after the Queef Sisters mention that Terrence and Phillip are the sisters' idols. They pair off into couples and travel the Canadian Wine Country together. Meanwhile, after Stan's mother Sharon queefs, she and Stan's sister, Shelley, start <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dinner table, causing Stan and his father Randy to leave.|$|E
5|$|Doink the Clown had annoyed Bam Bam Bigelow {{throughout}} October and November {{with such}} pranks as throwing water and confetti {{on him and}} dumping a pail of water on Bigelow's on-screen girlfriend Luna Vachon. He also tied a tripwire across the aisle during one of Bigelow's matches; after Bigelow fell over the wire, Doink attacked him with a broom. Bigelow responded by coming to the ring during one of Doink's matches and destroying Doink's toy wagon. The character of Doink was played by several wrestlers, who occasionally appeared at the same time. The match booked for Survivor Series advertised Bigelow teaming with Bastion Booger, who portrayed an overweight and dirty glutton, and The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu), a team of Samoans who were portrayed as savages, to face four Doinks. To promote the match, Doink appeared on the video wall {{that was part of}} the set during Bigelow's matches leading up to the event. The wall used a split screen to show multiple Doinks talking and <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the reports}} in the media tended to be {{critical}} of Patriarch Kirill and <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> claims that the dust was harmful, saying that it was just sand {{and it would have been}} far more efficient to just hire a maid to vacuum it up. The Patriarch himself then said he thought it to be inappropriate to forgive Shevchenko.|$|E
25|$|A {{manuscript}} left by Stanton {{describes his}} first finding Melmoth <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sight of two lovers {{who have been}} struck by lightning, and hearing of a wedding at which Melmoth was an uninvited guest: the bride died and the bridegroom went mad. Stanton's search for Melmoth is deemed to be madness and he is sent to a madhouse. Melmoth visits him there, and offers to free him, but Stanton refuses and escapes.|$|E
25|$|The bird the {{children}} have found has died, and {{the children}}, assisted by the adults, hold a funeral for it. Virginia is aware that she {{and the little girl}} are far more invested in the funeral than Vanessa's boys, who are probably <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> females behind their backs. As Virginia stares longingly at the dead bird she has an epiphany: her character, Clarissa Dalloway, is not like Virginia, and would not commit suicide. Like the bird's funeral bed, Clarissa represents -to Virginia- an uncaring, even foolish thing. As such, Clarissa will represent the death bed (the counterpoint) to the character who Virginia will have commit suicide.|$|E

25|$|In Liepāja {{the first}} mass killing of Jews {{took place on}} July 3 and 4, when about 400 people were shot dead, and on July 8 when 300 Jews were killed. The German group of SD and policemen did the shooting, while the members of Latvian Selbstschutz convoyed victims to the killing site. On July 13 the {{destroying}} of the large choral synagogue of Liepāja began. The rolls of the Scripture were spread on the Ugunsdzēsēju Square, and the Jews were forced to march across their sacred things, with watchers merrily <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> amusing scene. The above operations took place under the direct leadership of Erhard Grauel, commander of the Einsatzgruppe's Sonderkommando.|$|E
25|$|In return, {{the family}} must leave {{a portion of}} their supper (or beer, for the bierasal) to the spirit and must treat the kobold with respect, never mocking or <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> creature. A kobold expects to be fed in the same {{place at the same time}} each day, or in the case of the Hütchen, once a week and on holidays. One {{tradition}} says that their favourite food is grits or water-gruel. Tales tell of kobolds with their own rooms; the kobold Heinzelmann had his own chamber at the castle, complete with furnishings. and King Goldemar was said to sleep in the same bed with Neveling von Hardenberg. He demanded a place at the table and a stall for his horses. Keightley relates that maids who leave the employ of a certain household must warn their successor to treat the house kobold well.|$|E

500|$|During Florida's {{homecoming}} celebrations, the Gators played coach Bernie Moore's Mercer Bears, winning 73–0, {{and setting}} a scoring mark that remains the fifth-highest single-game scoring total in team history.

500|$|In the 15th Anniversary and 25th Anniversary paperbacks, Grant Morrison {{recalls how}} {{an early version}} of the script was passed around for review to a number of {{professionals}} in the comics industry without his knowledge. Most of them thought the heavy symbolism and psychological horror elements were not only pretentious, but comical, many of them <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> idea. In the apocrypha of the 15th anniversary edition, Morrison asks these people, [...] "Who's laughing now, @$$hole?" [...] Morrison would also add that the people [...] "who don't read comics regularly seemed to really enjoy the book." ...|$|E

[...] As an in-joke to Smith's reaction to when he first heard the track, the song starts with the manager saying [...] "Time release the fresh", Furtado <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> phrase, and Interscope Records A representative Thom Panunzio replying “You’re 100 percent right Chris.” The title and intro, during which Furtado chants [...] "the bigger the better" [...] against a bass line, references the character finding strength in the size of her earrings.|$|E
500|$|Working on studio sets {{was a new}} {{experience}} for Rathborne, whose previous work had all been filmed on location. She also found it refreshing {{to work with the}} series' ensemble cast, recalling that Miguel Ferrer often had the cast and crew <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> way he approached his material, imbuing the atmosphere during filming with a mix of comedy and drama. Rathborne has also noted the use of ordinary, almost banal, daily life in the series, finding it a necessary element {{to be able to play}} the series' more violent and surreal elements against effectively. She particularly singled out Cooper as a wholesome [...] "boy next door" [...] character who allowed the town's more unusual residents to stand out more starkly.|$|E

During the bridge, two girls in an {{elevator}} are seen <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> model's appearance, stating that she looks much older than they thought she was. Next scene, she is shown in a bathtub singing the song to herself. Another segment shows her breaking a mirror with her bare hand, which starts to bleed uncontrollably. In the final scene, she stands {{on the balcony of}} a building, crying and screaming at a billboard featuring one of her advertisements, saying that the model side of her isn't [...] "real and you can't save me", and that the public is oblivious to how she really lives.|$|E

500|$|The Room premiered on June 27, 2003 at the Laemmle Fairfax and Fallbrook {{theaters in}} Los Angeles. Wiseau {{additionally}} arranged a screening for {{the cast and}} the press {{at one of the}} venues, renting a spotlight to sit in front of the theater and arriving in a limousine. Ticket buyers were given a free copy of the film's soundtrack on CD. Although actress Robyn Paris described the audience <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> film, Variety reporter Scott Foundas, who was also in attendance, would later write that the film prompted [...] "most of its viewers to ask for their money back — before even 30 minutes [...] passed." [...] IFC.com described Wiseau's speaking voice in the film as [...] "Borat trying to do an impression of Christopher Walken playing a mental patient." [...] The Guardian described the film as a mix of [...] "Tennessee Williams, Ed Wood, R. Kelly's Trapped in the Closet".|$|E
500|$|On September 16, 2013, {{the song}} was {{unexpectedly}} used during player introductions by the Cincinnati Bengals in their home opener against the rival Pittsburgh Steelers on Monday Night Football, to tie in the song's jungle theme with the team's nickname. Throughout the game, {{the song was}} also played sporadically during game breaks. Although the Bengals won the game 20-10, the song drew much criticism by Bengals fans {{and even some of}} the team's players. One Bengals fan even told the Wall Street Journal that Steeler fans sitting near him were <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Bengals fans throughout the game; the Steelers themselves have used the Styx song [...] "Renegade" [...] frequently at Heinz Field since 2001. Four days after the game, the team publicly apologized, announcing that while the song would not be nixed from Paul Brown Stadium's playlist completely, the team would use a hard rock or classic rock song for player introductions moving forward.|$|E
500|$|... "Speak Now" [...] {{was written}} by Swift, as were all the tracks for the album. The song was {{inspired}} by the story of her friend and her high school boyfriend. The couple went their separate ways after high school – with the idea that they would get back together. One day, Swift's friend informed Swift that her high school boyfriend would soon wed. [...] "He had met this girl who's just this horrible, mean person who made him completely stop talking to all of his friends, cut off his family. She had him so completely isolated," [...] said Swift. She asked her friend if she would [...] "speak now." [...] Perplexed, her friend asked for an explanation, and she answered, [...] "You know, storm the church. 'Speak now or forever hold your peace.' I'll go with you. I'll play guitar. It'd be great." [...] Swift's friend found this to be humorous, <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> idea.|$|E
