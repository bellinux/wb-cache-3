5|$|German ethnologist Thomas Barthel, {{who first}} {{published}} the rongorongo corpus, identified three <b>lines</b> <b>on</b> the recto (side a) of tablet C, {{also known as}} Mamari, as a lunar calendar.

Berthin and Berthin propose that it is the text which follows the identified calendar which shows where the intercalary nights should appear. The Mamari calendar is the only example of rongorongo whose function is currently accepted as being understood, though it cannot actually be read.|$|E
