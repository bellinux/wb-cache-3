5|$|Since {{the early}} 20th century, {{excavations}} at the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles have yielded 100 tonnes of fossils from 600 species of flora and fauna, including several Columbian mammoths. Many of the fossils are {{the remains of}} animals that became stuck in asphalt puddles which seeped {{to the surface of}} the pits, 40,000 to 11,500 years ago. Dust and leaves likely concealed the <b>liquid</b> <b>asphalt,</b> which then trapped unwary animals. Mired animals died from hunger or exhaustion; their corpses attracted predators, which sometimes became stuck themselves. The tar pits' fossil record is dominated by the remains of predators, such as large canids and felids. Fossils of different animals are found stuck together when they are excavated from the pits. The tar pits do not preserve soft tissue, and a 2014 study concluded that asphalt may degrade the DNA of animals mired in it after an attempt was made to extract DNA from a Columbian mammoth.|$|E
5|$|Despite these successes, Parsons, {{the project}} {{engineer}} of Aerojet's Solid Fuel Department, remained motivated {{to address the}} malfunctions observed during the Ercoupe tests. In June 1942, assisted by Mills and Miller, he focused his attention on developing an effective method of restricted burning when using solid rocket fuel, as the military demanded JATOs that could provide over 100 pounds of thrust without any risk of exploding. Although solid fuels such as GALCIT-27 were more storable than their liquid counterparts, they were disfavored for military JATO use as they provided less immediate thrust {{and did not have}} the versatility of being turned on and off mid-flight. Parsons tried to resolve GALCIT-27's stability issue with GALCIT-46, which replaced the former's ammonium nitrate with guanidine nitrate. To avoid the problems seen with ammonium nitrate, he had GALCIT-46 cooled and then heated prior to testing. When it failed the test, he realized that the fuel's binding black powders rather than the oxidizers had resulted in their instability, and in June that year had the idea of using <b>liquid</b> <b>asphalt</b> as an appropriate binding agent with potassium perchlorate as oxidizer.|$|E

40|$|Warm mix asphalt (WMA) is an {{emerging}} clean production technology that alleviates {{the energy and}} environmental concerns of asphalt pavement industry. It is particularly suitable for asphalt rubber (AR) pavement, which provides longer service life and lower road-tyre noise but requires higher production temperature. Evotherm-DAT, a common <b>liquid</b> warm-mix <b>asphalt</b> (WMA) additive, can effectively improve the workability of AR binder, thus reducing the construction temperature of AR pavement. However, {{the properties of the}} Evotherm-DAT modified AR binders (Evo-AR) might be affected by the procedure of incorporating the WMA additive into AR, which unfortunately has not been fully studied yet. This study aims to address this issue by characterizing the rheological properties and chemical compositions of the Evo-ARs prepared by the following three procedures: 1) preparing AR first and then blending it with Evotherm-DAT (AR-E), the conventional approach; 2) mixing Evotherm-DAT and rubber first and then incorporating them to asphalt (ER-A); and 3) adding Evotherm-DAT during the mixing process of AR (REA). It was found that AR-E and REA had similar rheological properties. Besides, the workability of ER-A was slightly worse than those of AR-E and REA, but still much superior to that of AR without WMA additive. The anti-rutting performance of ER-A is better than those of AR-E and REA while no obvious difference was observed in the fatigue and low temperature cracking resistance among three types of Evo-ARs. Chemical characterization indicated that the preparation procedures affected the amount of epoxy groups in Evo-ARs, which possibly contributed to the difference in their rheological properties. Overall, it was concluded that incorporating Evotherm-DAT at an early stage has insignificant negative effect on the rheological properties of warm AR binder, but allows for more energy saving and emission reduction during the warm AR binder production process.

6000|$|There {{is a third}} Salse near Poole River, on the Upper Ortoire, {{which is}} extinct, or at least quiescent; but this, also, I could not visit. It is about {{seventeen}} miles from the sea, and about two hundred feet above it. As for the causes of these Salses, I fear the reader must be content, for the present, with a somewhat muddy explanation of the muddy mystery. Messrs. Wall and Sawkins are inclined to connect it with asphalt springs and pitch lakes. 'There is,' they say, 'easy gradation from the smaller Salses to the ordinary naphtha or petroleum springs.' It is certain that {{in the production of}} asphalt, carbonic acid, carburetted hydrogen, and water are given off. 'May not,' they ask, 'these orifices be the vents by which such gases escape? And in forcing their way to the surface, is it not natural that the <b>liquid</b> <b>asphalt</b> and slimy water should be drawn up and expelled?' They point out the fact, that wherever such volcanoes exist, asphalt or petroleum is found hard by. The mud volcanoes of Turbaco, in New Granada, famous from Humboldt's description of them, lie in an asphaltic country. They are much larger than those of Trinidad, the cones being, some of them, twenty feet high. When Humboldt visited them in 1801, they gave off hardly anything save nitrogen gas. But in the year 1850, a 'bituminous odour' had begun to be diffused; asphaltic oil swam {{on the surface of the}} small openings; and the gas issuing from any of the cones could be ignited. Dr. Daubeny found the mud-volcanoes of Macaluba giving out bitumen, and bubbles of carbonic acid and carburetted hydrogen. The mud-volcano of Saman, in the Western Caucasus, gives off, with a continual stream of thick mud, ignited gases, accompanied with mimic earthquakes like those of the Trinidad Salses; and this out of a soil said to be full of bituminous springs, and where (as in Trinidad) the tertiary strata carry veins of asphalt, or are saturated with naphtha. At the famous sacred Fire wells of Baku, in the Eastern Caucasus, the ejections of mud and inflammable gas are so mixed with asphaltic products that Eichwald says 'they should be rather called naphtha volcanoes than mud-volcanoes, as the eruptions always terminate in a large emission of naphtha.' ...|$|E

50|$|The {{introduction}} of polymer-modified bitumen and emulsion binder has increased chipseal's ability to prevent crack reflection and improve stone retention by improving {{the properties of}} the bitumen binder. Newer techniques use asphalt emulsion (a mixture of <b>liquid</b> <b>asphalt,</b> surfactant, and water) instead of asphalt. This has been shown to help reduce aggregate loss and reduce cost of installation, but can increase stripping. It reduces emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) due to the lower solvent content. New methods also utilize cross linking styrene acrylic polymers which also provide quality water resistance. Chips precoated with about one percent bitumen have been used successfully to minimize aggregate loss and to give the surface a black look. It can keep good pavement in good condition by sealing out water, but provides no structural strength and will repair only minor cracks. While the small stones used as surface yield a relatively even surface without the edges of patches, it also results in a very rough surface that leads to louder rolling noise from automobile wheels.|$|E

50|$|Tanenbaum is {{currently}} Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kilmer Van Nostrand Co. Limited, having served as President & CEO from 1968 to 2000. Under his direction Kilmer {{developed into a}} multi-faceted civil engineering construction company whose operating divisions and subsidiaries covered road building and paving, ready-mix concrete, aggregates, heavy construction, trucking and pipe manufacturing. The heavy construction operations included projects in Canada, the United States and South America and specialized in constructing subways, elevated transit system guideways, bridges and tunnels including the design-build of the Toronto Zoo elevated transit system, the elevated transit system in Miami and subways in Caracas, Atlanta, Calgary and Toronto. In 1984 this unit was merged with Canadian Foundation Company Ltd. which itself was later merged with Bannister International. From that time through December 2000 Kilmer’s road building, paving and aggregates operations were conducted through Kilmer’s wholly owned subsidiary, The Warren Paving & Materials Group Limited. Tanenbaum served as Chairman of Warren, which, until its merger with Lafarge North America, was Canada’s largest asphalt paving and aggregate company with operations serving approximately 54 communities. Warren’s activities also included major commercial aggregates operations, <b>liquid</b> <b>asphalt</b> trading and distribution and road maintenance. In December 2000 Warren was merged into Lafarge North America Inc., North America’s largest diversified construction materials company and supplier of cement, aggregates and concrete, and other materials for residential, commercial, institutional and public works construction in the United States and Canada. As {{a result of this}} merger, Kilmer became a significant shareholder in Lafarge NA, and Tanenbaum served on the Board and chaired its Finance Committee until the 2006 buyout by Lafarge SA.

5000|$|Many {{specimens}} also {{accumulated in}} natural traps, such as sinkholes and tar pits. The Hot Springs Mammoth Site in South Dakota is a 26,000-year-old, approximately 40 m-long sinkhole that functioned for 300 to 700 years before filling with sediment. The site {{is the opposite}} scenario of that in Waco; {{all but one of}} the at least 55 skeletons—additional skeletons are excavated each year—are male, and accumulated over time rather than in a single event. It is assumed that like modern male elephants, male mammoths primarily lived alone, were more adventurous (especially young males) and more likely to encounter dangerous situations than the females. The mammoths may have been lured to the hole by warm water or vegetation near the edges, slipping in and drowning or starving. Isotope studies of growth rings have shown that most of the mammoths died during spring and summer, which may have correlated with vegetation near the sinkhole. One individual, nicknamed [...] "Murray", lies on its side, and probably died in this pose while struggling to get free. Deep footprints of mammoths attempting to free themselves from the sinkhole's mud can be seen in vertically-excavated sections of the site. Since the early 20th century, excavations at the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles have yielded 100 tonnes of fossils from 600 species of flora and fauna, including several Columbian mammoths.
