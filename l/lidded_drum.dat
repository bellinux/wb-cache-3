40|$|Band type closure {{rings are}} {{commonly}} used for securing the drum lid on radioactive material packages of lower weight classifications. Lid installation is achieved by placing the band {{around the perimeter of}} the <b>lidded</b> <b>drum</b> and tightening the single bolt in stages until a designated torque value is obtained. The band is subjected to heavy rapping with a soft hammer during installation to equilibrate the band strains around the drum perimeter. The study described here investigated the strain distributions in the band throughout the installation process. The results show that a uniform strain distribution is achieved during installation and that the hammering of the band aids in achieving the uniform distribution. The results of the strain levels after the drop test indicate that the locking rings maintain some pre-tension, even after severe targeted drops that crush a portion of the drum top...|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} factors which affect the {{performance}} of a drum closure during drop tests. Important test conditions are: weight of package, height of drop, and angle of impact. Structural characteristics of the package determine its ability to withstand the test conditions imposed. These characteristics include: package diameter, shell material and thickness, strength of internal fill material (e. g., fiberboard), and configuration of closure (clamp-ring, bolted flange, etc.). For the clamp-ring closure configuration a study of published drop test results has shown that packages having a weight ratio of less than 50 per cent were typically able to retain their lids in hypothetical accident condition, 30 -ft drop tests. Those having weight ratios greater than 50 per cent typically failed. Prior testing over the integrity of the clamp-ring closure, consistently demonstrated that the clamp-ring is unable to retain the <b>drum</b> <b>lid</b> in thirty foot drop tests of packages containing the maximum allowed weight (640 lb), which confirms the previous studies. To determine if the clamp-ring closure is adequate for packages with lower weight contents, a series of tests were performed on packages weighing around 325 lb (i. e., a typical shipping weight for DOE packages) at a range of impact angles as detailed in this report. The test results consistently demonstrated that the standard clamp-ring closure is unable to retain the <b>drum</b> <b>lid</b> of standard 6 M packages weighing 325 lb...|$|R

40|$|In {{a coordinated}} effort, the Department of Transportation (DOT) and Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) {{proposed}} {{the elimination of}} the Specification Packaging from 49 CFR 173. [1] In accordance with the Federal Register, issued on October 1, 2004, new fabrication of Specification Packages would no longer be authorized. In accordance with the NRC final rulemaking published January 26, 2004, Specification Packagings are mandated by law to be removed from service no later than October 1, 2008. This coordinated effort and resulting rulemaking initiated a planned phase out of Specification Type B and Type A fissile (F) material transportation packages within the Department of Energy (DOE) and its subcontractors. One of the Specification Packages affected by this regulatory change is the UN 1 A 2 Specification Package, per DOT 49 CFR 173. 417 (a) (6). To maintain continuing shipments of DOE materials currently transported in UN 1 A 2 Specification Package after the existing authorization expires, a replacement Type A(F) material packaging design is under development by the Savannah River National Laboratory. This paper presents a summary of the prototype design effort and testing of the new Type A(F) Package development for the DOE. This paper discusses the progress made {{in the development of a}} Type A Fissile Packaging to replace the expiring 49 CFR UN 1 A 2 Specification Fissile Package. The Specification Package was mostly a single-use waste disposal container. The design requirements and authorized radioactive material contents of the UN 1 A 2 Specification Package were defined in 49 CFR. A UN 1 A 2 Specification Package was authorized to ship up to 350 grams of U- 235 in any enrichment and in any non-pyrophoric form. The design was specified as a 55 -gallon 1 A 2 drum overpack with a body constructed from 18 gauge steel with a 16 gauge <b>drum</b> <b>lid.</b> <b>Drum</b> closure was specified as a standard 12 -gauge ring closure. The inner product container size was not specified but was listed as any container that met Specification 7 A requirements per 49 CFR 178. 350. Specification 7 A containers were required to withstand Type A packaging tests required by 49 CFR 173. 465 with compliance demonstrated through testing, analysis or similarity to other containers. The maximum weight of the 7 A product container, the radioactive content, and any internal packaging was limited to 200 lbs. The total gross weight for the UN 1 A 2 Specification Package was limited to 350 lbs. No additional restrictions were applied. Authorization for use did not require the UN 1 A 2 Specification Package to be tested to the Normal Conditions of Transport (NCT) and Hypothetical Accident Conditions (HAC) required for performance based, Type A(F) packages certified by the NRC or DOE. The Type A(F) Packaging design discussed in this paper is required to be in compliance with the regulatory safety requirements defined in Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 10 CFR 71. 41 through 71. 47 and 10 CFR 71. 71. Sub-criticality of content must be maintained under the Hypothetical Accident Conditions specified under 10 CFR 71. 73. These federal regulations, and other applicable DOE Orders and Guides, govern design requirements for a Type A(F) package. Type A(F) packages with less than an A 2 quantity of radioactive material are not required to have a leak testable boundary. With this exception a Type A(F) package design is subject to the same test requirements set forth for the design of a performance based Type B packaging...|$|R

During the carnival season, the slaves performed songs in tents called Kaiso - later Calypso tents. Many early kaiso or calypso were performed in the French creole language and led by a griot or chantwell. As Trinidad became a British colony, the chantwell became known as the calypsonian. The British government tried to ban the celebration of carnival due to its aggressive overtone; this led to canboulay Riots between the Afro-creoles and the police, which banned the use of Stick fighting and African percussion music in 1881.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the testing of}} a newly developed drum pressure alert device (DPAD), which can non-intrusively monitor internal pressure of waste drums and provide an external alarm if internal pressure develops. It also discusses an integrated automatic identification data collection (AIDC) “button ” that supports waste life-cycle inventory management and provides a permanent, and resilient “tagging ” method for waste containers, waste storage facilities, waste certification facilities and waste transport vehicles. Since 1992, there have been approximately 150 recorded occurrences at U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) facilities associated with pressurized waste drums. These occurrences document {{the fact that many}} of the materials normally stored in drums can generate gasses, which can pressurize a waste storage container to unknown levels. Pressurized waste drums are a safety hazard that can lead to significant personnel injury and property damage caused by the expelled <b>drum</b> <b>lid</b> or fragments of the burst drum, as well as exposure to the radioactive or other hazardous contents. During the same period, it has become increasingly clear that manual inventory procedures currently being used at DOE sites to mark, track, and manage the vast amount of legacy and newly generated waste throughout the waste’s life-cycle have become obsolete. Waste container-tracking issues, which have resulted in questionable waste inventory accountability, may unwittingly contribute to the occurrences associated with pressurized waste storage containers...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the drop test {{results for the}} 9975 radioactive material shipping package being dropped 30 feet onto a unyielding surface followed by a 40 -inch puncture pin drop. The purpose of these drops was {{to show that the}} package lid would remain attached to the drum. The 30 -foot drop was designed to weaken the lid closure lug while still maintaining maximum extension of the lugs from the drum surface. This was accomplished by angling the drum approximately 30 degrees from horizontal in an inverted position. In this position, the drum was rotated slightly so as not to embed the closure lugs into the drum {{as a result of the}} 30 -foot drop. It was determined that this orientation would maximize deformation to the closure ring around the closure lug while still maintaining the extension of the lugs from the package surface. The second drop was from 40 inches above a 40 -inch tall 6 -inch diameter puncture pin. The package was angled 10 degrees from vertical and aligned over the puncture pin to solidly hit the drum lug(s) in an attempt to disengage the lid when dropped. Tests were performed in response to DOE EM- 76 review Q 5 inquires that questioned the capability of the 9975 <b>drum</b> <b>lid</b> to remain in place under this test sequence.

40|$|The {{concentration}} of 15 % hydrogen in {{air in a}} waste drum is used as the concentration at which the drum remains intact {{in the case of}} a deflagration. The following describes what could happen to the drum if 15 % hydrogen or more in air were ignited. Table 2 of the Savannah River report WSRC-TR- 90 - 165 ''TRU Drum Hydrogen Explosion Tests'' provides the results of tests performed in 55 -gallon drums filled with hydrogen and air mixtures. The hydrogen-air mixtures were ignited by a hot-wire igniter. The results of the tests are shown in Table 1. They concluded that drums can withstand deflagration involving hydrogen concentration up to 15 % hydrogen. Testing was performed at Idaho Falls and documented in a letter from RH Beers, Waste Technology Programs Division, EG&G Idaho, to CP Gertz, Radioactive Waste Technology Branch, DOE dated Sept. 29, 1983. In these tests, 55 -gallon drums were filled with hydrogen-air mixtures which were ignited. The results in Table 2. 2 showed that ignition for drums containing 11 % and 14 % hydrogen, the <b>drum</b> <b>lid</b> remained on the drum. Ignition in drum with 30 % hydrogen resulted in lid loss. It is concluded from the results of these two tests that, for uncorroded drums, a 15 % hydrogen in air mixture will not result in loss of drum integrity (i. e., lid remains on, walls remain intact). The drum walls however, may be thinned due to corrosion. The effect of the deflagration on thinner walls is assessed next. Assume a 15 % hydrogen in air mixture exists in a drum. The pressure assuming adiabatic isochoric complete combustion (AICC) conditions is 69 psig (using the same deflagration pressure calculation method as in HNF- 19492, ''Revised Hydrogen Deflagration Analysis which got 82 psig for 20 % hydrogen in air) ...|$|R
