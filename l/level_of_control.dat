5|$|Thrust {{vectoring}} {{was used}} to provide attitude control {{on the first two}} stages. The eight first stage combustion chambers were arranged in pairs which could gimbal either way along one axis. Two of the pairs were arranged perpendicular to the other two, and when all four pairs were used together, they provided roll, pitch and yaw control. The second stage had two combustion chambers, which could gimbal along two axes, providing the same <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> During a coast phase after second stage cut-off, the rocket was controlled by a reaction control system. The third stage did not have an attitude control system, and was instead spin-stabilised.|$|E
5|$|Attitudes of the Russian {{space program}} and NASA towards Phase One were also {{of concern to}} the astronauts involved. Because of Russia's {{financial}} issues, many workers at the TsUP felt that the mission hardware and continuation of Mir {{was more important than}} the lives of the cosmonauts aboard the station. As such the program was run very differently compared to American programs: cosmonauts had their days being planned for them to the minute, actions (such as docking) which would be performed manually by shuttle pilots were all carried out automatically, and cosmonauts had their pay docked if they made any errors during their flights. Americans learned aboard Skylab and earlier space missions that this <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> was not productive and had since made mission plans more flexible. The Russians, however, would not budge, and many felt that significant work time was lost because of this.|$|E
5|$|In January 1980, {{the members}} of TalkingHeads {{returned}} to New York City after the tours in support of their 1979 critically acclaimed third album, Fear of Music, and decided {{to take time off}} to pursue personal interests. Byrne worked with Eno, the record's producer, on an experimental collaboration named My Life in the Bush of Ghosts. Jerry Harrison produced an album for soul singer Nona Hendryx at the Sigma Sound Studios branch in New York City; the singer and the location were later used during the recording of Remain in Light on Harrison's advice. Husband and wife Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth discussed the possibility of leaving the band after the latter suggested that Byrne's <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> was excessive. Frantz was not open to the idea of ending TalkingHeads, and the two decided to take a long vacation in the Caribbean to ponder the state of the band and their marriage. During the trip, the couple became involved in Haitian Vodou religious ceremonies and practised with several types of native percussion instruments. While in Jamaica they socialised with the famous reggae rhythm section of Sly and Robbie.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} 1 {{examines}} {{the question of}} a “natural ” sonic feedback associated with keys of a numerical keyboard- in the context of use of an Automatic Teller Machine (ATM). “Natural ” is defined here as an obvious sound feedback with regards to the action made by a user on a device. The aim is then to study how “naturalness ” is related to the perceived usability and the perceived emotion of the sonic feedback before and after participants perform several tasks with the keyboard. Three <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> “naturalness ” are defined: causal, iconic, and abstract. In addition, two <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>controlled</b> usability <b>of</b> the system are used: a low level and a high one. Results show that pre-experimental ratings of perceived “naturalness ” and perceived usability were highly correlated. This relationship held after the participants interacted with the keyboard. “Naturalness ” and emotional aspects were less dependant, revealing that “naturalness ” and usability represent a special type of relation. However, results are affected by the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>controlled</b> usability <b>of</b> the system. Indeed, the positive change at the high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>controlled</b> usability for the iconic sounds (medium <b>level</b> <b>of</b> naturalness) obtained after the performance task failes at the low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>controlled</b> usability...|$|R

5|$|Out {{of sight}} of the band members, two of the gunmen placed a ten-pound (4.5kg) time bomb {{in the rear of the}} minibus. The UVF's plan was that the bomb would explode once the minibus had reached Newry, killing all on board. However, Martin Dillon alleged that the bomb was meant to go off in the Irish Republic. He {{suggested}} that had all gone according to plan, the loyalist extremists would have been able to clandestinely bomb the Republic of Ireland, yet claim that the band were republican bomb-smugglers carrying explosives on behalf of the IRA. They had hoped to embarrass the Government of Ireland, as well as to draw attention to its <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> of the border. This may have resulted in the Irish authorities enforcing tighter controls over the border, thus restricting IRA operations. Dillon opined that another reason the UVF decided to target the Miami Showband was because Irish nationalists held them in high regard; to attack the band was to strike the nationalists indirectly.|$|E
5|$|The Australian federal {{government}} retains some {{influence over the}} ACT government.

5|$|The more {{positive}} emotions and behavior that a 12- to 24-month-old toddler displays when coping with separation from a parent, the better s/he is 3.5 years later at using cooling strategies {{in order to}} delay gratification. This suggests that the emotional skills and processes required for coping with social and interpersonal frustrations {{are similar to those}} utilized for coping with the aggravation of goal-directed delay of gratification. Maternal attachment also influences the development of a child's ability to delay gratification. An interaction has been found between a mother's <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and how close a child stays to the mother while exploring the environment. Children who have controlling mothers and explore their environment at a far distance from her are able to employ more cooling strategies and delay rewards longer. Similarly, children who stay close to a non-controlling mothers also use more cool strategies and demonstrate longer delays. This suggests that some children of controlling mothers have better learned how to distract themselves from or effectively avoid intrusive stimuli, although additional effects on their emotional competency are speculated but unknown. A greater capacity to delay gratification by using effective attentional strategies is also seen in preschoolers whose mothers had been responsive and supportive during particularly stressful times of self-regulation when the child was a toddler, indicating that maternal responsiveness during highly demanding times is crucial for the development of self-regulation, self-control and emotional competency.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} how to provide {{multiple}} <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> for autonomous animated characters for use in interactive story systems. Much has been written {{on the problems of}} action-selection for autonomous agents and robots [Maes 90, Blumberg 94, Brooks 86]. Some work has focused on the specific problems of building autonomous animated characters [Reynolds 87, Tu 94].

It is this problem which is the topic of this paper and much of our research in general. This paper is organized as follows. We begin by identifying 4 different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and discuss the forms the control may take. We then describe how a particular autonomous agent architecture, developed by Blumberg and Galyean, supports these different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> Lastly, we describe the use of these ideas in 2 systems. Details of the underlying architecture may be found in [Blumberg 95...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of global autonomous motivation and global perceived control on young adults’ adaptive goal striving and emotional wellbeing. We reasoned that autonomously motivated participants who also perceive high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> would make accelerated progress with the pursuit of their most important goal and experience associated increases in emotional wellbeing. By contrast, we predicted that these benefits of autonomous motivation would be reduced among participants who perceive low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> A 6 -month longitudinal study of 125 college students was conducted, and self-reported global autonomous motivation, global perceived control, progress towards the most important goal, and emotional well-being were assessed. Regression analyses showed that the combination <b>of</b> high baseline <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> global autonomous motivation and global perceived control was associated with accelerated goal progress after 6 months, which mediated 6 -month increases in emotional well-being. These benefits were not apparent among autonomously motivated participants who perceived low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> The study’s findings suggest that global autonomous motivation and perceived control may need to work together to foster adaptive goal striving and emotional well-being...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study was to {{investigate}} how generation membership and career stage influences the incidence of workaholism. Contrary to hypothesis 1, no difference in workaholism was found across the three career stages: establishment, advancement, and maintenance. Hypotheses 2 and 3 were not supported, as workaholism levels did not differ between the Baby Boomers, Generation X, and Generation Y. However, additional results revealed differences on the <b>control</b> measure <b>of</b> the WART, as those in the establishment and advancement career stages had higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> than the maintenance stage and Generation Y had higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> compared to the Baby Boomer generation. A factorial MANOVA revealed that the structure of workaholism for those in Generation Y differed from the other generations in that they reported higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> compulsive tendencies. Practical implications include suggesting organizations establish workaholism awareness and interventions equally across all career stages and generations but provide greater support for those segments of the workforce that were found to be higher on the WART control measure.   M.

40|$|Employee {{ownership}} {{describes the}} situation where employees own an equity stake in an employing organisation. Psychologists have found that employee ownership positively relates to several attitudes that contribute to organisational effectiveness, including: Organisational Commitment, Job Satisfaction, Organisational Justice, and Psychological Ownership. Contrarily, economists point out that employee owned firms exhibit reduced value maximisation compared to investor owned firms, and suggest that employee influence in decision making produces suboptimal outcomes. This thesis investigated whether the psychological effects related to employee ownership {{are affected by the}} <b>level</b> <b>of</b> employee <b>control</b> over the organisation. Experiment 1 investigated if individuals display differing preferences for three factors related to formal and psychological ownership: equity, control, and information, and it was found that greater <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> each factor were preferred. Experiment 2 investigated which of two types <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> operational control or governance control, were preferred for different employee ownership conditions. Higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> were preferred in all cases with governance control preferred overall. Experiment 3 investigated if the preference for governance or operational control changed as the at-risk component of employee remuneration changed. As at-risk remuneration increased, greater <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> were preferred, and perceptions of organisational justice decreased. Overall it appeared that full organisational control produces the best outcomes in terms of organisational commitment, satisfaction, organisational justice, and psychological ownership, although acceptable outcomes are still possible with decreased <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>control...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the effects <b>of</b> work <b>control</b> and job demands on employee adjustment and work performance using a multidimensional measure <b>of</b> work <b>control</b> (assessing <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> task <b>control,</b> decision control and work scheduling control). It was proposed that {{the negative effects of}} job demands and employee adjustment would be moderated by high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> task <b>control.</b> It was also proposed that there would be evidence of main effects of both job demands and work <b>control</b> (particularly task-related <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>control)</b> on employee adjustment. To test these predictions, a study of 135 university employees holding administrative positions was undertaken. Methodological improvements over previous research included the use of both self-reported adjustment measures and supervisor ratings of work performance as outcome variables, and the assessment of the predictor and outcome measures at different points in time (self-reported adjustment was assessed at both Times 1 and 2). The results revealed some support for the proposal that the effects of job demands would be buffered by high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> task <b>control,</b> but not more peripheral aspects <b>of</b> work <b>control.</b> There were also significant main effects <b>of</b> task <b>control</b> on job satisfaction...|$|R
