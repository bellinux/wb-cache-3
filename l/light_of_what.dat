5|$|The five Gefion {{passages}} seem {{to highlight}} the championing of a new order antagonistic to goddess worship. In <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{appears to be an}} elaborate thematic statement about patrilineage in the poem, the new order may also have entailed a change in kinship systems. Grendel and his mother may stand as types of earlier, matrilineal tribes. Further the hall which is the object of struggle between Beowulf and the first two monsters may symbolize the consolidation of new hierarchical social organization among the northern Germanic peoples.|$|E
5|$|Over time, Dmowski {{became more}} {{receptive}} to Russian overtures, particularly neoslavism, warming up {{to the idea that}} Poland and Russia may have a common future, particularly due to Germany being their common enemy. In <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he regarded as Russian cultural inferiority, Dmowski felt that a strong Russia was more acceptable than a strong Germany. In Dmowski's view, the Russian policy of Russification would not succeed in subjugating the Poles, while the Germans would be far more successful with their Germanisation policies. He explained those views in his book Niemcy, Rosja i kwestia Polska (Germany, Russia and the Polish Cause), published in 1908.|$|E
25|$|While {{there is}} rich archaeological and {{linguistic}} evidence of earlier Germanic religious ideas, these sources are all mute, and cannot {{be interpreted with}} much confidence.

However, the presence of marked regional differences make generalization of any such reconstructed belief or practice a risky venture.|$|E

25|$|The Reform Judaism movement, {{the largest}} branch of Judaism in North America, has {{rejected}} the traditional view of Jewish Law on homosexuality and bisexuality. As such, {{they do not}} prohibit ordination of openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual people as rabbis and cantors. They view Levitical laws as sometimes seen to be referring to prostitution, making it a stand against Jews adopting the idolatrous fertility cults and practices of the neighbouring Canaanite nations rather than a blanket condemnation of same-sex intercourse, homosexuality, or bisexuality. Reform authorities consider that, in <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is seen as current scientific evidence {{about the nature of}} homosexuality and bisexuality as inborn sexual orientations, a new interpretation of the law is required.|$|E
500|$|Aristotle {{has been}} called unscientific by {{philosophers}} from Francis Bacon onwards {{for at least two}} reasons: his scientific style, and his use of explanation. His explanations are in turn made cryptic by his complicated system of causes. However, these charges need to be considered in the <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was known in his own time. His systematic gathering of data, too, is obscured by the lack of modern methods of presentation, such as tables of data: for example, the whole of History of Animals Book VI is taken up with a list of observations of the life histories of birds that [...] "would now be summarized in a single table in Nature – and in the Online Supplementary Information at that".|$|E
500|$|In August 2009, Martin Offiah, who {{was working}} as a pundit for {{broadcaster}} Sky Sports during the match, spoke to the News of the World, stating that he believed the blood replacement in the final minute of extra time where Julien Dupuy returned to the field [...] "looked very suspicious and, in <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> happened in the previous round with Harlequins, I think Hipkiss and Leicester should be called to question." [...] Leicester coach Richard Cockerill responded that the replacement was within the laws of the game and that the club had done nothing illegal. ERC confirmed that the match commissioner had spoken to the referee regarding the incident and on the basis that the referee was satisfied, no further action was required. Cardiff also confirmed that they were satisfied that no wrongdoing had taken place and would not seek any further action.|$|E

On the evening of March 3, Johnson attended a party in his honor; he drank heavily. Hung over the following morning at the Capitol, he asked Vice President Hamlin for some whiskey. Hamlin produced a bottle, and Johnson took two stiff drinks, stating [...] "I need all the strength for the occasion I can have." [...] In the Senate Chamber, Johnson delivered a rambling address as Lincoln, the Congress, and dignitaries looked on. Almost incoherent at times, he finally meandered to a halt, whereupon Hamlin hastily swore him in as vice president. Lincoln, who had watched sadly during the debacle, was sworn in, and delivered his acclaimed Second Inaugural Address.|$|E

It's a step backward for democracy in Thailand. We very much urge that democratic elections are held as soon as possible, which is a commitment military officials have made.

[...] He also found the maps and illustrations [...] "attractive and functional", and said {{the views of the}} Temple would help players visualize the unusual structure.

[...] Gordon-Levitt explained that he was drawn to the role of Tom because of his relatability to the character. [...] "I've had my heart broken before. Truly, truly broken.

Alain Vivien, former chairman of the French ministerial mission to combat the influence of cults (MILS), {{and the president of the}} Centre Contre les Manipulations Mentales (Centre Against Mental Manipulation), said many observers believed that Clinton was making his peace with big religious movements, [...] "because they offer an indispensable source of political financing", and that with the help of Scientologists, cults were infiltrating UN and European human rights associations and collaborating on virulent reports against France's policies.|$|E
