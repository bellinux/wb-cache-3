5|$|After {{completing}} {{the duties of}} a jury member at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, Vidya starred opposite Emraan Hashmi as a boisterous Punjabi woman in Ghanchakkar, a comic-thriller from director Raj Kumar Gupta. Critics were unenthusiastic about the film and it earned <b>little</b> <b>at</b> the box office. Vidya then provided the voice of Draupadi for Mahabharat, a 3D animation film based on the Indian epic of the same name.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{believe that}} the strike, and other strikes in Africa during the period, changed the urban and {{migration}} policies of the British government in Africa. Governor Hubert Young, after a long struggle, obtained research funding of labour migration in Africa. Historian Godfrey Wilson studied urban African labour from 1939 to 1940, but his work was halted. Although the strike achieved <b>little</b> <b>at</b> the time, it is seen a key moment {{in the emergence of}} African nationalism in Zambia. African townsmen discovered their identity, leading to trade unionism and the gradual emergence of anti-colonial politics. The actions by British authorities led to five years of prosperity for the mining companies; European miners struck for higher pay and were rewarded. In 1940, there were several mine strikes in the province which lasted over a week; 17 workers were killed and 65 injured.|$|E
5|$|In March 2006, Cooper starred as Pip/Theo in Three Days of Rain on Broadway with Julia Roberts and Paul Rudd. This was {{followed}} by minor roles in the romantic comedy Failure to Launch (2006) and the satirical comedy The Comebacks (2007). Cooper next appeared in the fifth season of Nip/Tuck (2007) as Aidan Stone, a television star on the fictional show Hearts 'N Scalpels. In 2008, he played the lead in Older than America, and appeared onstage in a production of Theresa Rebeck's play The Understudy at the Williamstown Theatre Festival alongside Kristen Johnston. Between his small roles of best friend to the main character in the 2008 comedies Yes Man and The Rocker, Cooper landed the lead role in the Ryuhei Kitamura-directed supernatural film The Midnight Meat Train (2008), based on Clive Barker's 1984 short story of the same name. Playing the dark character of a freelance photographer who tries to track down a serial killer was a departure from Cooper's previous comedic roles and an experience he found enjoyable. The film received positive reviews from critics, though it earned <b>little</b> <b>at</b> the box office.|$|E

5|$|Moon took {{lessons from}} one of the loudest {{contemporary}} drummers, Screaming Lord Sutch's Carlo <b>Little,</b> <b>at</b> ten shillings per lesson. Moon's early style was influenced by jazz, American surf music and rhythm and blues, exemplified by noted Los Angeles studio drummer Hal Blaine. His favourite musicians were jazz artists, particularly Gene Krupa (whose flamboyant style he subsequently copied). Moon also admired Elvis Presley's original drummer DJ Fontana, the Shadows' original drummer Tony Meehan and the Pretty Things' Viv Prince. He also enjoyed singing, with a particular interest in Motown. Moon idolised the Beach Boys; Roger Daltrey later said that given the opportunity, Moon would have left to play for the California band even {{at the peak of the}} Who's fame.|$|E
5|$|Things were {{different}} for the wealthy. Before the meal and between courses, shallow basins and linen towels were offered to guests {{so they could}} wash their hands, as cleanliness was emphasized. Social codes {{made it difficult for}} women to uphold the ideal of immaculate neatness and delicacy while enjoying a meal, so the wife of the host often dined in private with her entourage or ate very <b>little</b> <b>at</b> such feasts. She could then join dinner only after the potentially messy business of eating was done. Overall, fine dining was a predominantly male affair, and it was uncommon for anyone but the most honored of guests to bring his wife or her ladies-in-waiting. The hierarchical nature of society was reinforced by etiquette where the lower ranked were expected to help the higher, the younger to assist the elder, and men to spare women the risk of sullying dress and reputation by having to handle food in an unwomanly fashion. Shared drinking cups were common even at lavish banquets for all but those who sat at the high table, as was the standard etiquette of breaking bread and carving meat for one's fellow diners.|$|E

25|$|Equipped {{with three}} days' supplies, French resumed his advance at 9.30am on 15 February. At Abonâ€™s Dam, five {{miles north of}} the Modder, French sent his cavalry, {{supported}} by the fire of 56 guns, charging up a valley between two Boer held ridges. The charge was led by the 9th and 16th Lancers. The Boer riflemen, perhaps 600 in number, were able to achieve <b>little</b> <b>at</b> ranges of 1,000 yards.|$|E

25|$|The {{passage of}} a further two years saw {{the arrival of the}} one-one-one grid in 1981, albeit {{staggered}} in two rows. The turbocharged era had arrived for not only did Renault occupy the front row of the grid, but turbo-engined Ferraris were fourth and eighth. The Renaults dominated the race, but total reliability was still lacking and the day went to John Watson in a McLaren MP4/1. Second place went to Carlos Reutemann in the Williams FW07C from the Talbot-Ligier JS17 of Jacques Laffite, a lap down; the race speed was down a <b>little</b> <b>at</b> 137.64mph.|$|E
25|$|Williams hit his {{athletic}} peak in 1996, beginning with an American indoor record of 20.40seconds over 200m {{in the early}} stages of the season, which was the third fastest indoor time that year.

While competing at the Fresno Relays in California, Williams' 100m race was spoiled when his shoe came off. Keen to check his competitive level, Williams opted to run an impromptu 200m at the meet instead. He clocked a personal record time of 19.87seconds into a headwind, a time that only Michael Johnson and Frankie Fredericks had beaten since 1992.|$|E

Sometimes, she imprisons him in her lair in the graveyard, sucking his blood a <b>little</b> <b>at</b> a time. Sometimes, she is described as feeding on his semen. Legend says that a churel will hold a young man captive until he is elderly, or else uses him sexually until he withers, dies, and joins the spirit.

25|$|An open-bolt {{mechanism}} {{is a common}} characteristic of fully automatic firearms. With this system, pulling the trigger releases the bolt from a cocked, rearward position, pushing a cartridge from the magazine into the chamber, firing the gun. The bolt retracts to the rearward position, ready to strip the next cartridge from the magazine. The open-bolt system is often used in submachine guns and other weapons with {{a high rate of}} fire. It is rarely used in semi-automatic-only firearms, which can fire only one shot with each pull of the trigger. The closed-bolt system is generally more accurate, as the centre of gravity changes relatively <b>little</b> <b>at</b> the moment the trigger is pulled.|$|E
25|$|The {{residents}} of Styles wake to find Emily Inglethorp dying of strychnine poisoning. Hastings, a house guest, enlists {{the help of}} his friend Hercule Poirot, who is staying in the nearby village, Styles St. Mary. Poirot pieces together events surrounding the murder. On the day she was killed, Emily Inglethorp was overheard arguing with someone, either her husband Alfred or her stepson John. Afterwards, she seemed quite distressed and, apparently, made a new will â€” which no one can find. She ate <b>little</b> <b>at</b> dinner and retired early to her room with her document case. The case was later forced open by someone and a document removed. Alfred Inglethorp left Styles earlier in the evening and stayed overnight in the nearby village, so was not present when the poisoning occurred. Nobody can explain how or when the strychnine was administered to Mrs. Inglethorp.|$|E

25|$|In 1860, Aguadilla {{was officially}} {{declared}} a village. Several years later, when {{the island was}} territorially organized into seven departments, Aguadilla became {{the head of the}} third department that included the municipalities of Aguada, Isabela, Lares, Moca, Rincon, and San SebastiÃ¡n. In January 1841 a Royal Order transferred the judicial party from Aguada to Aguadilla. In 1878, according to Don Manuel Ebeda y Delgado, the territorial organization of Aguadilla had varied a <b>little.</b> <b>At</b> this time Plainela, HigÃ¼ey, and Mangual wards are not mentioned. The Dos Palmas ward appears as Palmar. Also at this time, three new wards are mentioned: Guerrero, Caimital Alto, and Caimital Bajo. In 1898, even with the change of sovereignty in the island, the territorial organization of Aguadilla is the same to that of 1878. Nevertheless, in the Census of 1899, downtown Aguadilla appears constituted by HigÃ¼ey, Iglesia, Nueva, Santa Barbara, and Tamarindo wards. Malezas ward appears subdivided into Maleza Alta and Maleza Baja. From that time, the territorial organization of Aguadilla did not change, until 1948, when the Puerto Rico Department of Planning prepared the map of the city and its wards, and following instructions of city authorities, HigÃ¼ey and parts of Caimital Alto wards are annexed to Downtown Aguadilla.|$|E
