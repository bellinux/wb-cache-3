Game was highly prized, but very rare, and included venison, wild boar, hare, rabbit, and birds. Kitchen gardens provided herbs, including some, such as tansy, rue, pennyroyal, and hyssop, which are rarely used today. Spices were treasured and very expensive at that time – they included pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and mace. Some spices used then, but no longer today in French cuisine are cubebs, <b>long</b> <b>pepper</b> (both from vines similar to black pepper), grains of paradise, and galengale. Sweet-sour flavors were commonly added to dishes with vinegars and verjus combined with sugar (for the affluent) or honey. A common form of food preparation was to finely cook, pound and strain mixtures into fine pastes and mushes, something believed to be beneficial {{to make use of}} nutrients.|$|E
5|$|Spices {{were among}} the most luxurious {{products}} available in the Middle Ages, the most common being black pepper, cinnamon (and the cheaper alternative cassia), cumin, nutmeg, ginger and cloves. They all had to be imported from plantations in Asia and Africa, which made them extremely expensive, and gave them social cachet such that pepper for example was hoarded, traded and conspicuously donated in the manner of gold bullion. It has been estimated that around 1,000 tons of pepper and 1,000tons of the other common spices were imported into Western Europe each year during the late Middle Ages. The value of these goods was the equivalent of a yearly supply of grain for 1.5 million people. While pepper was the most common spice, the most exclusive (though not the most obscure in its origin) was saffron, used as much for its vivid yellow-red color as for its flavor, for according to the humours, yellow signified hot and dry, valued qualities; turmeric provided a yellow substitute, and touches of gilding at banquets supplied both the medieval love of ostentatious show and Galenic dietary lore: at the sumptuous banquet that Cardinal Riario offered the daughter of the King of Naples in June 1473, the bread was gilded. Among the spices that have now fallen into obscurity are grains of paradise, a relative of cardamom which almost entirely replaced pepper in late medieval north French cooking, <b>long</b> <b>pepper,</b> mace, spikenard, galangal and cubeb. Sugar, unlike today, was considered to be a type of spice due to its high cost and humoral qualities. Few dishes employed just one type of spice or herb, but rather a combination of several different ones. Even when a dish was dominated by a single flavor it was usually combined with another to produce a compound taste, for example parsley and cloves or pepper and ginger.|$|E

J. oxycedrus is not known to grow in Egypt, and neither is Juniperus excelsa, which was found along with J. oxycedrus in the tomb of Tutankhamun. The berries imported into Egypt may have come from Greece; the Greeks record using juniper berries as a medicine long before mentioning their use in food. The Greeks used the berries in many of their Olympics events because of their belief that the berries increased physical stamina in athletes. The Romans used juniper berries as a cheap domestically produced substitute for the expensive black pepper and <b>long</b> <b>pepper</b> imported from India. It was also used as an adulterant, as reported in Pliny the Elder's Natural History: [...] "Pepper is adulterated with juniper berries, which have the property, to a marvellous degree, of assuming the pungency of pepper."

Methods : The design of this experimental study was randomized post-test only control group design. The samples were twenty eight male Wistar, 8 weeks which got egg yolk diets intermittenttly. The samples were divided into 4 groups, one group was control group (K) and the other was treatment group (P 1, P 2, P 3). All groups were given 1, 5 gram egg yolk diets intermittently for 2 weeks. After that the control group (K) was given standard diets, the second group (P 1) was given garlic’s essential oils, the third group (P 2) was given <b>long</b> <b>pepper’s</b> essential oils, and the last group (P 3) was given combination of garlic’s essential oils and <b>long</b> <b>pepper’s</b> essential oils for 3 weeks. The dose of essential oils was 0, 05 ml. The data were tested with One Way Anova. 					 		 Result : Cholesterol HDL level of treatment group P 1 (42, 41 ± 10, 25); P 2 (43, 59 ± 10, 43); and P 3 (36, 40 ± 6, 86) are lower than control group (45, 47 ± 9, 69).
