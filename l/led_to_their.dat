5|$|When Pallas was {{discovered}} by the German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Matthäus Olbers on 28 March 1802, it was counted as a planet, as were other asteroids in the early 19th century.

5|$|American {{and other}} {{immigrant}} families began arriving in St. Louis and opening new businesses, including printing and banking, {{starting in the}} 1810s. Among the printers was Joseph Charless, who published the first newspaper west of the Mississippi, the Missouri Gazette, on July 12, 1808. In 1816 and 1817, groups of merchants formed the first banks in the town, but mismanagement and the Panic of 1819 <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> closure.|$|E
5|$|An Auschwitz {{survivor}} {{with the}} mutant {{ability to generate}} powerful magnetic fields and manipulate metal, who was once friends with Xavier (with whom he helped to build Cerebro) until his belief that humans and mutants could never co-exist <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> separation, leaving him to develop a sophisticated knowledge in matters of genetic manipulation, which he uses {{in an attempt to}} mutate the world leaders in order to allow mutant prosperity.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{reforming}} actions such as the Bill of Middlesex, the Common Pleas became increasingly conservative and resistant to King's Bench changes because of the impact they had on {{the business of the}} Common Pleas. This was best emphasised by Slade's Case, a struggle between the old and new forms of suing for breach of contract; although an equilibrium between the common law courts was finally reached, it eventually <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> dissolution with the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, and merger into a single High Court of Justice.|$|E

5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} novels, Fleming used events {{from his past}} as elements in his novel. Whilst at Kitzbühel in the 1930s, Fleming's car, a Standard Tourer, had been struck by a train at a level crossing {{and he had been}} dragged fifty yards down the track. From that time on he had associated trains with death, which <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> use as a plot device not just in The Man with the Golden Gun, but also in Diamonds Are Forever and From Russia, with Love.|$|E
5|$|Capital {{and energy}} of urban enterprisers {{affected}} {{the development of}} mining and metallurgy during the earlier Commonwealth period. There were several hundred hammersmith shops {{at the turn of}} the 17th century. Great ironworks furnaces were built in the first half of that century. Mining and metallurgy of silver, copper and lead had also been developed. Expansion of salt production was taking place in Wieliczka, Bochnia and elsewhere. After about 1700 some of the industrial enterprises were increasingly being taken over by land owners who used serf labor, which <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> neglect and decline in the second half of the 17th century.|$|E

Seven of the Cumberland players moved to neighbours Western Suburbs, although only Harry Bloomfield, A. Halling and S. Jarvis played first-grade rugby league again.|$|E

At Mount Pleasant, the Rockets failed to score a touchdown and suffered their first loss {{of the season in}} a 13–12 loss. The Rockets scored first on a 28-yard Rusty Hanna field goal, but the Chippewas responded with a 53-yard Jeff Bender touchdown pass to Ken Ealy to take a 7–3 lead {{at the end of the}} first quarter. A 46-yard Hanna field goal in the second cut the Central lead to 7–6 at halftime.|$|E

5|$|The College {{buildings}} {{were used as}} a farm into the 19th century, until the expansion of Maidstone <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> demolition as the neighbouring area was developed.

The buildings are currently owned by Maidstone Borough Council having been donated to the borough by Sir Garrard Tyrwhitt-Drake, mayor of the borough in 1949–50. A plaque commemorating the presentation is fixed inside the archway of the Gatehouse.|$|E
5|$|The Turboliners were {{a family}} of gas turbine {{trainsets}} built for Amtrak in the 1970s. They {{were among the first}} new equipment purchased by Amtrak to update its fleet with faster, more modern trains. The first batch, known as RTG, were built by the French firm ANF and entered service on multiple routes in the Midwestern United States in 1973. The new trains led to ridership increases wherever used, but the fixed consist proved a detriment as demand outstripped supply. The high cost of operating the trains <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> withdrawal from the Midwest in 1981.|$|E
5|$|The aim of {{the revolt}} was to inspire a wider {{uprising}} among the general populace {{in an attempt to}} overthrow the colonial regime and establish independence.
