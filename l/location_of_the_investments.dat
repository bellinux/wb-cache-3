40|$|Purpose – The paper aims {{to examine}} <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> outward foreign direct {{investment}} (O-FDI) on home-country productivity. Design/methodology/approach – A panel data set for 15 Taiwanese manufacturing industries over the period between 1991 and 2007 is employed for a model in which productivity is regressed on a measure of O-FDI. Findings – The study finds no significant positive or negative effect of O-FDI on productivity. Breaking down <b>the</b> data by <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>investment,</b> however, we find that O-FDI in other countries enhances productivity in Taiwan, while O-FDI in China does not. We interpret <b>the</b> positive role <b>of</b> O-FDI in other countries as relating to <b>the</b> outcome <b>of</b> strategic asset-seeking nature of Taiwanese investments in these countries. Research limitations/implications – In order to analyse <b>the</b> productivity effect <b>of</b> O-FDI more precisely, one would need to compare the firm outcomes in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> multinational production with the outcomes that would have prevailed in <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> multinational production. Unfortunately, we cannot observe what would have happened to firms that did engage in multinational production had they not done so. Practical implications – The findings suggest that the Taiwanese Government should distinguish <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> liberalization towards O-FDI for different locations and in different types of industries. In particular, the government should channel more investment towards export-oriented industries especially those in “other countries”.

40|$|Abstract: Cities are exploding, occupying rural {{territory}} in dispersed and fragmented ways. A {{consequence of this}} phenomenon is that the demand for utilities includes more and more extensive territories. Among them, fulfilling the demand for services related to integrated water service presents many difficulties. The economic costs needed to meet service demand and the environmental costs associated with its non-fulfilment are inversely proportional to the population needing service in rural areas, since that population is distributed across a low-density gradient. Infrastructure planning, within <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> competence, generally follows a policy of economic sustainability, fixing a service coverage threshold {{in terms of a}} “sufficient” concentration of population and economic activity (91 / 271 /CEE). This threshold, homogenous within <b>the</b> territorial limits <b>of</b> a water infrastructure plan, creates uncertainty in <b>the</b> planning <b>of</b> <b>investments,</b> which are not sized on the actual, appropriately spatialized, demand for service. Careful prediction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> infrastructure <b>investments</b> would guarantee not only economic savings but also reduce the environmental costs generated by <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> utilities. Therefore, is necessary to create a link between water infrastructure planning and urban planning, which is responsible for the future spatial distribution of service demand. In this study, the relationships between <b>the</b> instruments <b>of</b> regulation and planning are compared by a multi-criteria spatial analysis network (analytic network process (ANP)). This method, tested on a sample of a city in southern Italy, allows us to optimize <b>the</b> design and <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>investment</b> needed to meet the service criteria, looking at <b>the</b> actual efficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> networks. <b>The</b> result <b>of</b> this application is a suitability map that allows us to validate the criteria for defining urban transformations...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} an introduction and five self-contained studies analyzing different aspects of roundwood markets. Geographically it is focused on Sweden (paper 1 - 3) and Russia (paper 4 - 5). Four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> papers (1 - 2, 4 - 5) are explicitly considering international trade and its effects and possibilities in the domestic markets. The other paper (3), only implicitly takes account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> international market (for pulpwood), in that we see a loss of competitiveness in Sweden to foreign competition. In Paper 1 we consider <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> market imperfections in the Swedish pulpwood market. Two methods to measure market power are used, but the results reject market imperfections. In Paper 2 we measure the substitution between imported and domestic pulpwood. Using a variable cost function for the wood raw material input, {{we find that the}} substitution possibilities between the wood raw materials input in most cases seemed high. Further, the own and cross price elasticities were generally high, strongly supporting the argument that it is the relative price that is the main factor behind the imported volumes. In paper 3, it is found that the responsiveness to economic stimuli such as prices and costs are very low, in both short and long run. There is evidence of a reduced responsiveness, lower in the in the period 1976 - 1996 than in the period 1958 - 1975. Paper 4 - 5 investigates the possibilities for exploiting the vast Russian forest resources. Paper 4 uses the Porter framework to analyze {{what has happened in the}} Russian forestry between 1990 and 1998. We describe demand and factor conditions, the conditions in related industries, <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> government and finally <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> ownership conditions for <b>the</b> future prospects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russian forest industry. The result is a conception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russian competitiveness in the forest sector as relying heavily on factor conditions. Our findings are that this makes the Russian competitive advantage frail and that this advantage may vanish with further changes in <b>the</b> other determinants <b>of</b> Porter's framework. Finally, in paper 5, we investigate the key factors determining Nordic foreign direct investments (FDI) decisions in the Russian forest industry. The responses indicate that the prime motivation for investments made has been to serve local and regional markets, and not to take advantage of low labor and raw material costs. Access to well-developed physical infrastructure and prior contacts with future Russian partners have been important factors determining <b>the</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>investment.</b> <b>The</b> companies emphasize different institutional factors, such as an ambiguous legal system, difficulties in negotiating with local authorities, and general political instability. In paper 5 it is thus concluded that FDI into the Russian forest sector is likely to remain low until there is a fundamental change in the legal and political systems.

40|$|Hungary is {{increasingly}} appearing on <b>the</b> map <b>of</b> trade in services. This is mainly due to <b>the</b> appearance <b>of</b> foreign owned shared services centres, regional or even global headquarters of multinationals. First, data problems {{are listed in}} detail when analysing tradable services (applying, extending and analysing in-depth the problems indicated by Kirkegaard, 2005). It draws the conclusion that using available statistical data on trade and FDI is misleading in trying to assess <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> Hungary's participation in <b>the</b> international division <b>of</b> labour in services. Moreover, lack <b>of</b> data hinders <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> other aspects. That is why the paper relies on detailed company case studies (8 companies interviewed in 2008 out of around 50 such centres in Hungary). Two aspects of export oriented services projects are analysed in detail: locational advantages of Hungary which attract such projects {{to the country and}} <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> these projects on the host economy. Vertical FDI associated with this type of efficiency seeking and highly export oriented projects, has completely different localisation requirements and local impact than horizontal FDI, which up till around 2000 dominated services FDI inflows in Hungary. As an analytical framework, Barba Navaretti, Venables, 2004 is used. The paper identifies <b>the</b> various elements <b>of</b> locational advantages connected to different elements of investment motives, in terms of cost reduction, reducing costs of disintegration of production, reducing other costs, and motives arising from <b>the</b> confluence <b>of</b> vertical and horizontal FDI, and relates these elements to <b>the</b> specificities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> business services sector. It differentiates general motives, which play a role in compiling <b>the</b> "longer list" <b>of</b> possible investment <b>locations</b> and motives which play the most important role in deciding about <b>the</b> final <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>investment.</b> Analysis <b>of</b> Hungary is supplemented with a comparison with the other three Visegrad countries. The paper also presents the most important channels through which FDI in business services may affect the host country. The analysis is based on theories, dealing mainly with <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> manufacturing FDI, and especially of vertical FDI on the host economy (e. g. Dunning, 1993, Lall, 1980, Blomstr 9 ̆ 4 m, Kokko, 1997, Barba Navaretti, Venables, 2003, Caves, 2007), taking 3 into account specificities <b>of</b> business services. <b>The</b> paper identifies the following areas in which business services FDI impacts upon the host economy: job creation (type of activities and categories of employees affected), backward and forward linkages with local companies and with other local actors, and other spillovers (impact on the business environment and infrastructure, spillovers through trained employees) ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{investigate}} {{the changes in}} practice strategy {{that have taken place}} since 1986. DESIGN [...] Comparison of practices in 1986 and 1992. SETTING [...] 93 % of group practices (26 practices) in a single family health services authority. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Changes in staffing, premises, equipment, clinic services, and incomes between 1986 and 1992. RESULTS [...] In 1986, 28 % of practices employed a nurse; in 1992, 92 % did so. Between 1986 and 1992, 14 cost-rent schemes costing more than 10, 000 pounds had been started. Certain practices, designated innovators, were more likely to possess specified items of equipment than other practices. Computer ownership was widespread: 77 % of practices had a computer, compared with 36 % in 1986. In 1992, 16 practices had a manager, compared with 10 in 1986. Clinic services provided by more than half of practices were well established services (antenatal, for example), new services for which a payment had been introduced (such as diabetes, asthma, minor surgery), or the more readily provided "new" clinic services (diet, smoking cessation). Gross income increased, but so did practice costs, especially for innovators. Practices in the more affluent area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family health services authority were still more likely to invest in their premises and staff, and to provide more services than those in the declining area. In the more affluent area, practices had higher costs but also higher incomes. CONCLUSION [...] Between 1986 and 1992, practices in this area invested heavily in equipment and services, but differences remain, depending on <b>the</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> practice. <b>Investment</b> has increased, particularly in the more deprived part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area, so that the inconsistency in standards has been much reduced.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 30 years, the United States {{has seen a}} great {{transference}} of wealth from its old manufacturing regions to its regions of comparatively less wealth. This transfer can be explained through Convergence Theory, which predicts exactly that type of movement.

40|$|While most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equipments, {{machinery}} and capacity investments in Russian forest sector {{dates back to}} 1970 s, they are mostly out-of-date, wastefully, environmentally damaging and <b>the</b> productivity <b>of</b> them is weak. Domestic possibilities to finance forest investments in Russia are still under developing, and the forest sector is not attractive among Russian investors due to the more profitable sectors such as energy, technology and metal clusters. Therefore, the forest sector calls urgently for forest investments to develop, to create more value added production and to survive in international competition in final product markets. Along with the global profit maximisation many foreign forest enterprises have established especially in Northwest Russia during 1990 s and 2000 s. However, most of these investments are of small-scale (saw- and veneer mills, packaging plants), {{and they can be}} seen as pilot investments to test market environment and, especially, <b>the</b> working <b>of</b> wood procurement.

The viewpoint is mostly of Finnish forest enterprises and investors.

40|$|This {{study showed}} that certain {{influences}} in the global environment may {{have an impact on}} FDI?s regional or country choice <b>of</b> <b>investment.</b> <b>The</b> following research questions were explored. Are changes in FDI location choices due to elevated transportation costs? Has the emphasis on market changed to a stauncher stance toward efficiency factors due to current oil pricing? The data was tested by applying multiple linear regressions using archival data from Dun and Bradstreet, the World Bank, and <b>the</b> Bureau <b>of</b> Economic Analysis (BEA). This study looked at data in snapshots of two years of a decade beginning with 1997 and ending with 2007. A broader dataset which has already been developed will be expanded to include the dramatic changes in oil prices pre Y 2 K and post Y 2 K. It was hypothesized that results will reflect that <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> transportation will drive investment closer, rather than further, from <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> <b>investment.</b> Due to <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> FDI immobility, it is further hypothesized that emphasis will be placed on efficiency factors rather than market because of concern about transportation costs. The purpose will be to explore the features that affect <b>the</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foreign direct <b>investment,</b> and to address the differences in emphasis, if any, by decision-makers upon <b>locations</b> chosen because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present transport costs. <b>The</b> findings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tests were theoretically along the same lines as the hypothesis predicted. In 1997 market factors were dominant instead of efficiency factors. This was seen through <b>the</b> significance <b>of</b> GDP growth and <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> roads paved. In 2007 exchange rates and distance showed significance, moving factors to a stauncher stance toward efficiency. A pooled regression showed <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> transportation cost over all. When looking at the variances at the 0. 1 p level a rise in <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> FDI <b>investment</b> was found, concluding that the hypothesis and transportation cost results were counter intuitive...|$|R
40|$|Economic reforms {{along with}} its promise of {{increasing}} income and growth rates have also raised concerns about its distributional implications. These concerns are at <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arguments <b>of</b> those who oppose certain economic reforms. Focusing on the economic reforms implemented in India, we investigate <b>the</b> distributional implications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reforms using four waves of nationally representative household survey data over the period 1983 to 2000. Chapter 1 provides an overview <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economic policies in India, including a discussion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reforms implemented in 1991. We also examine the economic performance across states and regions in India over the period 1980 - 2000. 	Chapter 2 investigates <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> economic geography, as measured by proximity to markets and suppliers. In this chapter we ask two questions, first whether market access affects regional wage inequality and second, whether that has changed after the reforms in 1991 were implemented. With <b>the</b> deregulation <b>of</b> private sector activity implemented as a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reforms, <b>location</b> features such as proximity to markets and suppliers are likely to influence <b>the</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> new <b>investments.</b> <b>The</b> differences in spatial features contribute to <b>the</b> between-region component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total income inequality. We find that regions closer to the ports have higher wages associated with them. On the other hand, greater proximity to domestic markets and sources of supply are not associated with higher region wage premia before liberalization. However, there is heterogeneity in their role over the time period under study. We find that post-reforms <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> domestic market and supply access has become stronger {{and they have a}} positive and statistically significant impact on wages associated with a region. <b>The</b> effect <b>of</b> greater access to ports {{does not appear to have}} become any stronger post-reforms. This suggests that <b>the</b> share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> between-region component in the total income inequality will be higher, resulting in an increase in spatial income inequality, in the post-reform period. 	Chapter 3 evaluates empirically <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dramatic 1991 trade liberalization in India on its industry wage structure. The empirical strategy uses the variation in industry wage premia and trade policy across industries and over time. We find a strong and robust relationship between reductions in Indian trade barriers and an increase in the industry wage premia over time. We also find that trade liberalization has led to decreased wage inequality between skilled and unskilled workers in India...|$|R
