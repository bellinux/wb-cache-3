25|$|In the 1970s, Norwegian {{sociologist}} Johan Galtung first {{created the}} term peacebuilding through his promotion of systems {{that would create}} sustainable peace. Such systems needed to address {{the root causes of}} conflict and support <b>local</b> <b>capacity</b> for peace management and conflict resolution. Galtung's work emphasized a bottom-up approach that decentralized social and economic structures, amounting to a call for a societal shift from structures of coercion and violence to a culture of peace. American sociologist John Paul Lederach proposed a different concept of peacebuilding as engaging grassroots, local, NGO, international and other actors to create a sustainable peace process. He does not advocate the same degree of structural change as Galtung.|$|E
25|$|USAID has {{implemented}} a four-year, US $23 million program called MIRA (Manejo Integrado de Recursos Ambientales) or Integrated Management of Environmental Resources. MIRA {{is aimed at}} strengthening the <b>local</b> <b>capacity</b> to create and administer watershed management plans. The program will also stimulate policy reform related to the integrated management of natural resources. MIRA promotes stakeholder dialogues that involve local authorities, private businesses, other donors, NGOs, and the beneficiary communities. The objective here is of building consensus on the vision and priorities needed to achieve that vision. USAID/MIRA is working in 12 out of the 21 watersheds in Honduras. Four of these watersheds (Choluteca, Cangrejal, Patuca and the Bay Islands) had been previously designated by USAID as priority watersheds. An additional eight watersheds were selected based upon bio-physical, socio-economic and institutional criteria.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, the Siberian Tiger Project was founded, {{with the}} aim of {{providing}} a comprehensive picture of the ecology of the Amur tiger and the role of tigers in the Russian Far East through scientific studies. By capturing and outfitting tigers with radio collars, their social structure, land use patterns, food habits, reproduction, mortality patterns and their relation with other inhabitants of the ecosystem, including humans is studied. These data compilations will hopefully contribute toward minimizing poaching threats due to traditional hunting. The Siberian Tiger Project has been productive in increasing <b>local</b> <b>capacity</b> to address human-tiger conflict with a Tiger Response Team, part of the Russian government’s Inspection Tiger, which responds to all tiger-human conflicts; by continuing to enhance the large database on tiger ecology and conservation with the goal of creating a comprehensive Siberian tiger conservation plan; and training the next generation of Russian conservation biologists.|$|E

Thus, it is often <b>local</b> <b>capacities</b> that determine how many survive {{in the immediate aftermath}} of a sudden onset natural disaster. The TEC studies found that international agencies experienced major problems in scaling up their own responses. Those agencies that had invested (before the disaster) in developing their emergency response capacity had the potential to be more effective. Pre-existing links, and mutual respect, between international agencies and local partners also led to better use of both international and <b>local</b> <b>capacities.</b>|$|R

2500|$|One of the Paris Declaration's {{priorities}} is {{to reduce}} systems of aid that are [...] "parallel" [...] to local systems. For example, Oxfam reported that, in Mozambique, donors are spending $350 {{million a year on}} 3,500 technical consultants, which is enough to hire 400,000 local civil servants, weakening <b>local</b> <b>capacity.</b> [...] Between 2005 and 2007, the number of parallel systems did fall, by about 10% in 33 countries. In order to improve coordination and reduce parallel systems, the Paris Declaration suggests that aid recipient countries lay down a set of national development priorities and that aid donors fit in with those plans.|$|E

We then estimate the parameters of this model, which reveal {{the direct and}} spillover effects of <b>local</b> state <b>capacity,</b> both using reduced-form instrumental variables techniques and structurally (using GMM, simulated GMM or maximum likelihood).

2500|$|In July 2009 and 2010, Virgin Media Broadband {{came first}} in an Ofcom {{broadband}} speed {{test in the}} UK. Ofcom tested typical speeds of broadband services provided by most ISPs in the UK, including BSkyB, BT, Tiscali, AOL, TalkTalk, Plusnet, O2 and Orange. Since most broadband connections in the UK are provided by ADSL, {{and the quality of}} individual phone lines varies according to distance from exchange, most landline broadband services are marketed as being the maximum speed that the individual's phone line will support, [...] "up to 8mb". As a result, actual speeds obtained vary greatly, but are always constrained by the individual phone line – the quality of which is out of the control of the broadband provider. Cable broadband has no such speed variability caused by connection quality as the network is fully owned and controlled by the cable company providing the broadband – any slowdowns are wholly as a result of traffic shaping, or <b>local</b> <b>capacity</b> being over-sold or over-subscribed. For this reason, the results showed that Virgin Media's broadband speed was closer to (although still not 100% of) the [...] "up to" [...] figures it advertised, compared to the other providers tested.
