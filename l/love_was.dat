5|$|According to Ovid, Myrrha was the {{daughter}} of King Cinyras and Queen Cenchreis of Cyprus. It is stated that Cupid was not to blame for Myrrha's incestuous love for her father, Cinyras. Ovid further comments that hating one's father is a crime, but Myrrha's <b>love</b> <b>was</b> a greater crime. Ovid therefore blamed it on the Furies.|$|E

5|$|In February 2003, <b>Love</b> <b>was</b> {{banned from}} Virgin Airlines by founder Richard Branson after being arrested at Heathrow Airport for disrupting a flight. In October of that year, {{in the midst}} of what Love would later admit was a serious cocaine and {{prescription}} drug addiction, she was arrested in Los Angeles after breaking several windows of her producer and then-boyfriend James Barber's home, and was charged with being under the influence of a controlled substance; the ordeal resulted in her losing custody of her daughter. On March 18, 2004, <b>Love</b> <b>was</b> arrested in New York City for allegedly striking a 24-year-old male fan with a microphone stand at a concert at the Bowery Ballroom. Four days later, on March 22, Love called in multiple times to The Howard Stern Show, making various claims and speaking erratically; in broadcast conversations with Stern, she claimed that the incident with the fan had not occurred, and that actress Natasha Lyonne, who was at the concert, was told by the alleged victim that he had been paid $10,000 to file a false claim leading to Love's arrest. She pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in October 2004.|$|E

5|$|While a few critics praised {{elements}} of its composition and execution, The Dawn of <b>Love</b> <b>was</b> very poorly received when first exhibited. Etty {{had developed a}} reputation for painting realistic figures, and his stylised Venus was thought unduly influenced by foreign artists such as Rubens {{as well as being}} overly voluptuous and unrealistically coloured, while the painting as a whole was considered tasteless and obscene. The Dawn of <b>Love</b> <b>was</b> not among the 133 paintings exhibited in the major 1849 retrospective exhibition of Etty's works, and its exhibition in Glasgow in 1899 drew complaints for its supposed obscenity. In 1889 it was bought by Sir Merton Russell-Cotes, and has remained {{in the collection of the}} Russell-Cotes Art Gallery & Museum ever since.|$|E

50|$|Passionate <b>love</b> <b>is</b> {{associated}} with strong feelings {{of love and}} desire for a specific person. This <b>love</b> <b>is</b> full of excitement and newness.

5|$|Aerith was {{designed}} by Tetsuya Nomura, with influence from director and scenario writer Yoshinori Kitase and Hironobu Sakaguchi, whilst Yoshitaka Amano created conceptual artwork which also helped to influence her design. She has green eyes and long brown hair tied in a braid with a pink ribbon. She wears a long pink dress, a bolero jacket, and brown hiking boots. The long dress {{was designed}} to appear ladylike and as a contrast to Tifa Lockhart's miniskirt. During development, Aerith {{was supposed to be}} Sephiroth's sister as both designs resembled each other, but they were made former lovers with Aerith remembering Sephiroth when meeting Cloud as both are ex-SOLDIERS. Late during development, Aerith's first <b>love</b> <b>was</b> changed to Zack Fair.|$|E
5|$|After a gap of two years, Sukumar's next directorial 100% Love (2011) was released. Sukumar {{envisioned the}} film's concept 15 years ago, which {{dealt with the}} simple {{conflicts}} couples face {{and the way they}} solve them, and made changes based on the technological and behavioural developments {{of the students in the}} colleges. 100% Love featured Naga Chaitanya and Tamannaah in the lead roles and was produced by Allu Aravind and Bunny Vasu. 100% <b>Love</b> <b>was</b> commercially successful; it received the Best Home-viewing Feature Film award at the annual Nandi Awards ceremony.

5|$|Although romantic <b>love</b> <b>was</b> not discouraged, marriages were {{arranged}} as agreements and bonds formed between two clans (with property {{as the chief}} concern), not necessarily two individuals. A father's input on who his sons and daughters should marry carried more weight than the mother, although a grandfather could override a father's decision. Once a couple had married, the new wife was obligated to visit the family temple so she could {{become part of the}} husband's clan and be properly worshipped by her descendants after death. However, she retained her natal surname. The vast majority of people during Han practiced monogamy, although wealthy officials and nobles could afford to support one or many concubines in addition to their legal wife.|$|E

5000|$|Some authors make a {{distinction}} between unconditional love and conditional love. In conditional love: <b>love</b> <b>is</b> 'earned' on the basis of conscious or unconscious conditions being met by the lover, whereas in unconditional <b>love,</b> <b>love</b> <b>is</b> [...] "given freely" [...] to the loved one [...] "no matter what". <b>Loving</b> <b>is</b> primary. Conditional <b>love</b> requires some kind of finite exchange, whereas unconditional <b>love</b> <b>is</b> seen as infinite and measureless. Unconditional <b>love</b> should not <b>be</b> mistaken with unconditional dedication: unconditional dedication or [...] "duty" [...] refers to an act of the will irrespective of feelings (e.g. a person may consider they have a duty to stay with someone); unconditional <b>love</b> <b>is</b> an act of the feelings irrespective of will.|$|R
5|$|B. Nagi Reddy and Aluri Chakrapani signed L. V. Prasad {{to direct}} a bilingual film for Vijaya Vauhini Studios. The film's script, by Chakrapani, was based on Rabindranath Maitra's Manmoyee Girls School and Sharadindu Bandhopadhyay's Detective. Chakrapani thought the plot of Manmoyee Girls School, about two {{unemployed}} young people who pretend {{to be married to}} gain employment and fall in <b>love,</b> <b>was</b> too limited for a full-length film. He added the basic storyline of Detective, in which an enthusiastic detective finds a missing woman and marries her. Prasad's relationship with Khan, a Muslim tailor near Kohinoor Studios in Bombay (now Mumbai), was the basis of the film's friendship between two men of different religions. The film was titled Missamma in Telugu and Missiamma in Tamil.|$|E
5|$|Courtly <b>love</b> <b>was</b> the eroticisation of {{love between}} the nobility. Emphasis {{was placed on}} {{restraint}} between lovers. Though sometimes expressed through chivalric events such as tournaments, where knights would fight wearing a token from their lady, {{it could also be}} private and conducted in secret. The legend of Tristan and Iseult is one example of stories of courtly love told in the Middle Ages. It was an ideal of love between two people not married to each other, although the man might be married to someone else. It was not uncommon or ignoble for a lord to be adulterous– Henry I of England had over 20bastards for instance– but for a lady to be promiscuous was seen as dishonourable.|$|E
5|$|Denning met {{his future}} wife Mary Harvey on 25 October 1914 aged fifteen at his confirmation; she was the {{daughter}} of the Vicar of Whitchurch. Denning attempted to court her for many years, but for a long time his <b>love</b> <b>was</b> unrequited, with Mary wanting them to be only friends. After a dance at Beaulieu on 18 January 1930 she finally admitted her love for him, and he returned to Hampshire with her to pick out an engagement ring. Barely six months away from the set date for their wedding Mary was diagnosed with tuberculosis, but she recovered and the couple were married on 28 December 1932, with the wedding officiated by Cecil Henry Boutflower, Bishop of Southampton.|$|E
