40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to measure the main aspects that {{characterize}} the feeding behavior in six months old calves fed using three different feed spaces allowance. During the experiments the following feeding behavior aspects were determined: number of <b>feeding</b> periods, the <b>length</b> of <b>feeding</b> periods and the total <b>length</b> of <b>feeding</b> periods. Results showed that calves spent feeding, on average, 292 minutes in the morning, 198 minutes in the afternoon and only 71 minutes during the night when the <b>length</b> of <b>feeding</b> space was 0. 6 m per calf. Calves spent feeding 175 minutes during the morning, 193 minutes during the afternoon and 53 minutes during the night when the <b>length</b> of the <b>feeding</b> space was 0. 32 m per calf. Calves spent feeding 255 minutes during the morning, 227 minutes during the afternoon and 30 minutes during the night when the <b>length</b> of the <b>feeding</b> space was 0. 28 m per calf.

40|$|Partial Feed {{simulating}} {{moving bed}} (SMB) {{has proved to}} be more efficient in binary separation performance (purity, recovery, productivity) because of its two additional degrees of freedom, namely <b>feed</b> <b>length</b> and <b>feed</b> time, as compared to classical SMB process. The binary separation of dextran T 6 and fructose with linear isotherm is modeled with Aspen Chromatography simulator in a four zone SMB with one column per zone for both normal-feed and Partial Feed. Increase in number of <b>feed</b> <b>length</b> and <b>feed</b> time in the cycle plays a very important role in the separation performance with Partial Feed. In addition, the effect of mode of operation (early or late introduction of increase in number of <b>feed</b> <b>length</b> in the cycle) on product purity and recovery is also investigated. Furthermore, the binary separation system is designed with the safety margin method and the optimum operating parameters for simulation are calculated with triangle theory. Finally, a new strategy with Partial Feed is developed, showing improved separation performance relative to the basic four-zone SMB with regard to extract stream purity and recovery. The results of the proposed study can served as a useful summary of Partial Feed operation...|$|R

The experimental design was of randomised blocks (B 1 = initial weight of 1. 04 ± 0. 05 g and B 2 = 1. 36 ± 0. 02 g), with two replicates within each block and five treatments (230, 270, 310, 350 and 390 g CP/kg diet). The fish were fed to satiation, three times a day for 90 days. The study evaluated: survival rate, weight gain, final <b>length,</b> <b>feed</b> intake, feed conversion ratio, protein efficiency ratio, specific growth rate and condition factor. There was a linear effect of dietary protein levels for protein efficiency ratio, specific growth rate (positive linear effect) and feed conversion ratio (negative linear effect).

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effects of feed withdrawal on the viscera of commercial broilers. Birds were withdrawn from feed 0, 3, 9, 12, 14, 16, or 18 h before slaughter. Crop and gizzard contents were determined after dissection, and intestinal shape and villi were subjectively scored. Raw liver color was measured colorimetrically. <b>Length</b> of <b>feed</b> withdrawal (time) and its interaction with grower (time by grower) and replication (time by replication) had a significant effect (P < 0. 05) on gizzard contents, intestinal shape, and villi; however, time by grower and time by replication did not affect the crop contents or the incidence of bile contamination in the digestive tract. Results also suggested that the integrity of the intestines declined after 12 to 14 h feed withdrawal, as indicated by heavy intestinal sloughing. Color analyses of livers showed that <b>length</b> of <b>feed</b> withdrawal did not affect lightness (L * values), but livers became less red (lower positive a*) as feed withdrawal time increased. It was concluded that <b>length</b> of <b>feed</b> withdrawal significantly affected the gastrointestinal tract; however, variation in the appearance of the liver could not be attributed solely to broiler feed withdrawal time.

40|$|Food-limitation in late larval {{and early}} post-larval plaice, Pleuronectes platessa, {{may be an}} {{important}} factor in the determination of year class strength. In this study data on stomach content, hepato-somatic index and condition index of metamorphosing and early post-larval plaice from a sandy beach in the mouth of the Western Schelde are compared to data from the Zwin lagoon. Settlement in the area starts at the end of february. All plaice examined from the sandy beach were fasting. Their condition, as measured by hepato-somatic index and condition index, did not differ significantly from the condition of feeding post-larvae from the lagoon.
