5|$|September 3–8, 1915 – A Category 3 {{hurricane}} meanders {{around the}} islands for several days, {{during which time}} gale-force winds blow from nearly all directions. Heavy rains cause many roofs to leak, and overall damage is extensive. Enormous waves from the hurricane wreck many boats; one cargo ship in particular, the SS Pollockshields, is driven aground on a reef off Elbow Beach. The captain drowns while attempting to procure a <b>life</b> <b>jacket</b> for a crew member, but all other men are eventually rescued.|$|E
5|$|A {{cargo ship}} picked up {{eight of the}} {{aforementioned}} survivors from the Doña Marilyn; eleven other survivors were found on Maripipi Island and on a nearby inlet, ten were discovered on Sambawan Island, and four others were found floating in the water. In Almagro, 137survivors washed onshore on October25, 120ofwhom reached shore by either a <b>life</b> <b>jacket</b> or a life boat. Eighteen other survivors were buried in a common grave in Almagro and nine other bodies, also found in Almagro, were shipped to Tacloban. In Tacloban, six other survivors were buried, but over 60survivors were also found on the island, and were transported on four buses and taken to receive medical treatment. Twenty-two were found on Samar Island, including two in Calbayog. Overall, the shipwreck was confirmed to have killed 77, even though 261others were listed missing.|$|E
5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{surrounds the}} sole {{survivor of the}} flight, a Czech officer, Eduard Prchal. Prchal, like many pilots who {{did not wish to}} tempt fate was known for never wearing his Mae West <b>life</b> <b>jacket</b> — but on this occasion, when rescued from the sea, he was wearing one. During the inquiry he denied this, and later blamed the inconsistency on post-crash shock affecting his actions and memory – essentially, on amnesia. Later he explained that he must have instinctively put the vest on when he realised the plane was in trouble. Polish aviation expert Jerzy Maryniak created a simulation of the crash, in which he concluded that the plane must have been under control up until the very moment of the crash. Kisielewski argues that the plane was likely {{under the control of the}} second pilot, who died in the crash.|$|E

50|$|In many jurisdictions, the {{operator}} {{of a vehicle}} is legally obligated to carry safety equipment with or on them. Common examples include seat belts in cars, helmets on motorcycles and bicycles, fire extinguishers on boats, buses and airplanes and <b>life</b> <b>jackets</b> on boats and commercial aircraft. Passenger aircraft carry {{a great deal of}} safety equipment including inflatable slides are rafts, oxygen masks, oxygen tanks, <b>life</b> <b>jackets,</b> satellite beacons and first aid kits. Some equipment such as <b>life</b> <b>jackets</b> has led to debate regarding their usefulness. In the case of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961, the <b>life</b> <b>jackets</b> saved many people but also led to many deaths when passengers inflated their vests prematurely.|$|R
5|$|Objects from Titanic {{have been}} {{exhibited}} for many years, though {{only a few}} were retrieved before {{the discovery of the}} wreck in 1985. The Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax, Nova Scotia has a collection of wooden fragments and an intact deckchair plucked from the sea by the Canadian search vessels that recovered the victims' bodies. Various other museums, including the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich and the SeaCity Museum in Southampton, have objects donated by survivors and relatives of victims, including some items that were retrieved from the bodies of victims. More donated Titanic artifacts {{are to be found in}} the Merseyside Maritime Museum in Liverpool and the Titanic Historical Society's museum in Indian Orchard, Springfield, Massachusetts. The latter's collection includes items such as the <b>life</b> <b>jacket</b> of Madeleine Astor, the wife of millionaire Titanic victim John Jacob Astor IV, a rivet which was removed from the hull before Titanic went to sea, an ice warning which never reached the bridge, a restaurant menu and a sample square of carpet from a First Class stateroom.|$|E

25|$|However, {{there is}} a chance that these water {{pressure}} activated inflation devices do not inflate the <b>life</b> <b>jacket</b> if a person is wearing waterproof clothing and falls into the water face-down. In these cases the buoyancy of the clothing holds a person on the water surface, which prevents the hydrostatic release. As a result, a person can drown although wearing a fully functional <b>life</b> <b>jacket.</b> In addition there are some circumstances in which the use of self-triggering devices can result in the wearer becoming trapped underwater. For example, the coxswain of a bowloader rowing shell risks being unable to escape should the craft capsize.|$|E
25|$|Videos {{recording}} passengers {{during the}} capsizing have been recovered. Some recorded the announcements telling passengers {{to stay in}} place and put on <b>life</b> <b>jackets,</b> while some showed passengers joking around, putting on <b>life</b> <b>jackets,</b> and sending farewells.|$|R

5000|$|Although the {{aircraft}} was not equipped with <b>life</b> <b>jackets,</b> the safety instruction card {{located on the}} back of each seat instructed passengers to use <b>life</b> <b>jackets</b> in case of ditching. [...] "LIFE JACKET UNDER YOUR SEAT" [...] was also clearly written.|$|R

25|$|It was {{not until}} lifesaving {{services}} were formed that the personal safety of boat crews heading out in pulling boats in generally horrific sea conditions was addressed. The modern <b>life</b> <b>jacket</b> is generally credited to one Captain Ward, a Royal National Lifeboat Institution inspector in the United Kingdom, who created a cork vest in 1854 to be worn by lifeboat crews for both weather protection and buoyancy.|$|E
25|$|Now {{aware that}} the {{characters}} who originally survived the movie can die, Max and the others decide to save anyone they can. They dress Tina in a <b>life</b> <b>jacket</b> and mittens, to prevent her from undressing. They also decide that Max, the only remaining virgin, is the new final girl, and plot to get Billy's machete into her hands so she can kill him and end the film. Meanwhile, Max and Nancy bond, and theorize that, if Nancy survives the movie, she can go back home with Max and be whomever she wants.|$|E
25|$|In February 2013, Air New Zealand {{released}} an in-flight safety video to promote its {{partnership with the}} New Zealand Department of Conservation. The video featured Man v Wild star Bear Grylls, performing antics he is known for from his television show, including jumping into a river with a <b>life</b> <b>jacket</b> and eating glow worms. The video uses natural features to represent fixtures and safety equipment on the aircraft, such as a hole in a hill as overhead lockers, and a cave with glow worms to be the emergency lighting. The video featured William Coxhead, a regular in Air New Zealand safety videos.|$|E

25|$|To be on {{the safe}} side, a pill-activated {{inflation}} device is preferred. A small pill that dissolves on water contact is the safest option, as it also works in shallow waters where a hydrostatic activator fails. This type of jacket is called an 'automatic'. As it is more sensitive to the presence of water, early models could also be activated by very heavy rain or spray. For this reason, spare re-arming kits should be carried on board for each <b>life</b> <b>jacket.</b> However, with modern cup/bobbin mechanisms this problem rarely arises and mechanisms such as the Halkey Roberts Pro firing system have all but eliminated accidental firing.|$|E
25|$|Bakari {{reported}} having no <b>life</b> <b>jacket</b> and only minimal swimming skills, but {{she managed to}} hold on to a piece of fuselage wreckage. Most of the time that was to elapse before her rescue was night. She reported later that initially there must have been other survivors as she could hear them after the crash but later the voices became silent. In the morning of the next day Bakari came to realize she was alone at sea having been drifting for hours without food and water. She also {{reported having}} seen a ship on the horizon that was, however, too far away to take notice of her.|$|E
25|$|After S.C. No 7 {{became a}} total loss in August, Lahm's small {{detachment}} received a new aircraft, S.C. No. 13, a Wright C Speed Scout equipped with pontoons for water landings. On September 11, 1913, Lahm attempted a water takeoff for a flight test but {{the center of gravity}} on the aircraft made it tail-heavy and it flipped over. Although the aircraft was totally destroyed, Lahm was saved from drowning by a <b>life</b> <b>jacket.</b> In November, at his own request, he was relieved of flying duties and returned to troop duties. He was assigned to command of a troop of the 7th Cavalry in September 1914, just after the outbreak of war in Europe.|$|E

25|$|At about 11:45pm ship's time Gracie was jarred awake by a jolt. He sat up, {{realized}} the ship's engines {{were no longer}} moving, and partially dressed, putting on a Norfolk jacket over his regular clothes. Reaching the Boat Deck, he {{realized the}} ship was listing slightly. He returned to his cabin {{to put on his}} <b>life</b> <b>jacket</b> and on the way back found the women he had been chaperoning. He escorted them up to the Boat Deck and made sure they entered lifeboats. He then retrieved blankets for the women in the boats, and along with his friend Smith assisted Second Officer Charles Lightoller in filling the remaining lifeboats with women and children.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 18 {{passengers}} survived the collision. Passengers {{who were able}} to see downstream became aware of the rapidly closing motions of the vessels, and rightly concluded that the collision was imminent. Fourteen of the survivors were thrown clear and surfaced without difficulty. Three others were briefly trapped under the George Prince. The last survivor had run back to his vehicle, thinking he would be safer in his truck. After the collision, he managed to escape his sinking vehicle through a window. Only one survivor had a <b>life</b> <b>jacket</b> before going into the water, but had not had time to put it on. Two others found life jackets floating in the river, which they used for a short time, but neither man had time to properly don the life jackets.|$|E
