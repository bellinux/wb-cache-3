The line is operated by VAG Freiburg, the city transport operator for Freiburg.

25|$|Due to {{mismanagement}} at {{the hands}} of Soviet authorities, one of the main aerial trams experienced a major malfunction, causing the 1990 Tbilisi cable car accident and remaining closed ever since. Since October 2017, the aerial tram has been under reconstruction, keeping the old culturally significant <b>lower</b> <b>station</b> but with plans for new gondolas, masts, upper station and other infrastructure. The project is carried out by Doppelmayr Garaventa Group.|$|E
25|$|The funicular/lift rises {{along an}} 11.8% incline to the Rua da Bica de Duarte Belo, a {{distance}} of , from the Rua de São Paulo. The transit system includes the Rua da Bica, Largo de Santo Antoninho and Travessa da Bica Grande. The Bica funicular, much like the Funicular of Lavra and the Glória Funicular, is moved by the Tramway system: using cable and water weights, with the cars equipped with water deposits. The <b>lower</b> <b>station</b> is almost hidden behind a facade on the Rua de S. Paulo with the inscription Ascensor da Bica.|$|E

25|$|In 1912, the Nova Companhia dos Ascensores Mecânicos de Lisboa {{signed a}} new {{contract}} with the municipality, allowing it to expand the electrification of all the lines. Between 1914 and 1916, the project to automate the transport system using electrical systems was completed. Unfortunately, during the conclusions of the process there was an accident {{with one of the}} cars, which became uncontrollable and crashed into the Rua de São Paulo <b>lower</b> <b>station,</b> resulting in its complete destruction. As a result, the funicular transport became inoperable for the next few years.|$|E
25|$|On May 31, 1889, the South Fork Dam on the Little Conemaugh River, {{upstream}} of Johnstown, collapsed. The resulting deluge {{devastated the}} city, killing over 2,000people.

To provide easy transportation across the steep slope for {{the residents of the}} new community of Westmont, as well as to function as an escape route for future floods, the company opted to construct the Johnstown Inclined Plane, a funicular. A bridge had to be built to connect Johnstown to the <b>lower</b> <b>station</b> of the incline, {{on the opposite side of}} Stonycreek River as the city.|$|E
500|$|Each tram car travels {{on a pair}} of 2inch (49mm) steel track ropes, totaling four cables. The track ropes {{combined}} are tensioned at {{over one}} million pounds (4.4 million newtons). A fifth cable—the haul rope—is a continuous loop which winds around the drive bullwheel at the <b>lower</b> <b>station,</b> connects to one car, winds through a counterweighted bullwheel at the upper station, then to the other car, before joining itself. [...] The haul rope length is over 7000feet (2100m).|$|E

500|$|The {{stations}} {{each had}} three platforms; a broad island platform in the centre for passengers waiting to board trains, and narrower outer platforms from which passengers exited the trains. Although the upper station {{was known as}} Hereson Road from the outset, the <b>lower</b> <b>station</b> was never officially named. It was known at various times as [...] "Olympia", [...] "Beach", [...] "Sands" [...] and [...] "Lower Terminus". The platforms and ticket offices were immediately outside {{the mouth of the}} tunnel at both stations.|$|E
500|$|The tram {{consists}} of two stations and a single intermediate tower. Two tram cars operate in a pendular mode on parallel track ropes and are pulled in unison by a haul rope which is driven by an engine at the lower terminal; when one car is at the upper terminal, the other is at the lower terminal, and vice versa. [...] The <b>lower</b> <b>station</b> is located beside an OHSU facility in the South Waterfront neighborhood, adjacent to {{a stop on the}} Portland Streetcar line, which connects the South Waterfront neighborhood with downtown Portland.|$|E
500|$|The [...] {{intermediate}} tower {{allows the}} tram to gain elevation quickly once leaving the <b>lower</b> <b>station</b> {{to provide adequate}} clearance over Interstate 5. The tower is 22 feet wide and 20 feet long at its base (6.7 m by 6 m), 8 feet by 8 feet (2.4 m by 2.4 m) at its narrowest point—nearly two-thirds up the tower—and 32 feet by 8 feet (9.8 m by 2.4m) at the top. It rests on a pier cap 5 feet (1.5m) thick supported by 35 piers. [...] The tower was fabricated in nearby Vancouver, Washington, and barged in three pieces up the Willamette River.|$|E

500|$|Some critics, at {{the time}} of construction, cited the tram as an example of {{corporate}} welfare for OHSU with limited public benefit. [...] A 2001 study done by OHSU prior to the tram's being designed projected that the tram would have 4,700 riders per day by 2030, with less than one fifth (850) of those being non-OHSU users. [...] While the <b>lower</b> <b>station</b> has easy public access, access to the upper station requires navigating through the OHSU hospital. The Cascade Policy Institute, a local libertarian research group, criticized the project for being [...] "railroaded through the political process by small groups of private interests", and expressed doubt that tram construction would lead to new jobs.|$|E
500|$|In 1865, plans {{included}} a circa [...] long line branching {{from the main}} line east of the company's existing terminus in Shoreditch, and a new station at Liverpool Street as the main terminus, with Bishopsgate station {{to be used for}} freight traffic. The station at Liverpool Street was to be built {{for the use of the}} GER and of the East London Railway on two levels, with the underground East London line around [...] below this, and the GER tracks supported on brick arches. The station was planned to be around [...] in area, with its main façade onto Liverpool Street and an additional entrance on Bishopsgate-Street (now called Bishopsgate and forming part of the A10). The main train shed was to be a two-span wood construction with a central void providing light and ventilation to the <b>lower</b> <b>station,</b> and the station buildings were to be in an Italianate style to the designs of the GER's architect.|$|E
500|$|On May31, 1889, the South Fork Dam {{collapsed}} upstream of Johnstown on the Little Conemaugh River. The resulting deluge {{devastated the}} city, killing 2,209people. As the city rebuilt, the Cambria Iron Company started {{work on a}} residential development atop Yoder Hill. To provide easy transportation {{up and down the}} steep slope for the residents of the new community of Westmont, the company decided to construct an inclined plane. In addition to being a convenient mode of transportation, the Johnstown Inclined Plane doubled as an escape route in case of another flood. Diescher was hired by Cambria Iron to design the incline. The rails used in the incline were all manufactured in Johnstown at Cambria Iron, with many of the tools needed in the construction also handcrafted there. The [...] Inclined Plane Bridge was built to span the Stoneycreek River to provide access to the <b>lower</b> <b>station</b> of the incline. Originally named the Cambria Inclined Plane, the Johnstown Inclined Plane opened on June1, 1891 and cost $133,296 to build. The convenience the incline provided stimulated a rapid growth of population in Westmont and made the borough one of the country's first suburbs. Over 40million trips were taken on the incline in its first 80years of operation.|$|E
