40|$|To predict {{whether the}} Polywater G <b>lubricant</b> <b>residue</b> {{remaining}} in the velocity, density, and temperature tree (VDTT) and the waste in Tank 241 -SY- 101 (101 SY) will be chemically compatible with wastes in 101 SY when two VDTTs are removed from 101 SY, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory measured the thermal reaction sensitivity of the <b>lubricant</b> <b>residue.</b> This residue is a simulated 101 SY waste containing the organic surrogate trisodium hydroxyethyl-ethylenediaminetriacetate (Na{sub 3 }HEDTA) and two simulated potential waste and <b>lubricant</b> <b>residue</b> mixtures containing 10 and 90 percent <b>lubricant</b> <b>residue.</b> These studies using accelerating rate calorimetry found that the residue did not react at a rate exceeding 0. 1 J/min/g mixture up to 190 degrees C with simulated 101 SY waste containing Na{sub 3 }HEDTA as the organic surrogate. Also, the dried <b>lubricant</b> <b>residue</b> did not decompose exothermically at a rate exceeding 0. 1 J/min/g. Using guidelines used by the chemical industry, {{these results indicate that}} the <b>lubricant</b> <b>residue</b> should not react as a significant rate with the waste in 101 SY when added to the waste at 60 degrees C or when the mixture cools to the waste`s temperature of 48 degrees C...|$|E
40|$|The {{best way}} to reduce the {{possibility}} of a fuel or oil spill is to take preventative steps to minimize the chance that a spill will occur. Preventative steps include: (1) use of food grade oil; (2) proper storage and handling of fuel and oils and; (3) regular maintenance and inspection of equipment. In spite of taking these steps to minimize spills, accidents do occur. Even though most spills tend to happen during harvest, you should be prepared to handle a fuel or oil spill {{at any time during the}} year. Should an accidental spill occur, be prepared to respond quickly. Clean-up preparedness requires: (1) prior training in clean-up procedures; (2) immediate availability of clean-up (spill kit) materials and; (3) prompt notification to the handler. Following the recommended practices will insure food safety and reduced environmental risk. Despite the fact that the FDA tolerance, the legal allowable amount of food grade <b>lubricant</b> <b>residue</b> that can occur on cranberries, is 10 ppm, the goal of every grower should be to deliver fruit with no food-grade oil residue. Remember that there is no tolerance for non-food grade oil or fuel on cranberries...|$|E
50|$|Materials {{for use in}} vacuum are {{materials}} showing {{very low}} rate of outgassing in vacuum, and, where applicable, tolerant to the bake-out temperatures. The requirements grow increasingly stringent with the desired degree of vacuum achievable in the vacuum chamber.The materials can produce gas by several mechanisms. Molecules of gases and water can be adsorbed on the material surface (therefore materials with low affinity to water have to be chosen, which eliminates many plastics). Materials may sublimate in vacuum (this excludes some metals and their alloys, most notably cadmium and zinc). Or the gases can be released from porous materials or from cracks and crevices. Traces of <b>lubricants,</b> <b>residues</b> from machining, can be present on the surfaces. A specific risk is outgassing of solvents absorbed in plastics after cleaning.|$|R
40|$|The {{premature}} {{failure of a}} large agglomeration machine used for the annual production of 360, 000 m(3) of eucalypt fiber panels was investigated to identify the nucleation and growth mechanisms of cracking in PH stainless steel belts (126 m x 2. 9 m x 3. 0 mm). These belts are used to compress a cushion composed of eucalyptus fibers and glue, being the pressure transmitted from the pistons {{by the action of}} numerous case-hardening steel rolls. Examination of the belt working interfaces (belt/rolls and belt/eucalypt fibers) indicated that the main cracking was nucleated on the belt/roll interface {{and that there is a}} clear relationship between the crack nucleation and the presence of superficial irregularities, which were observed on the belt/roll working surface. Used rolls showed the presence of perimetric wear marks and 2 mu m silicon-rich encrusted particles (identified as silicon carbide). <b>Lubricant</b> <b>residues</b> contained the presence of helicoidal wires, which were originated by the release of the stainless steel cleaning brush bristles, and 15 mu m diameter metallic particles, which were generated by material detachment of the belt. The presence of foreign particles on the tribological interface contributed to an increase of the shear stresses at the surfaces and, consequently, the number of the contact fatigue crack nucleation sites in the belt/roll tribo-interface. The cracking was originated on the belt/roll interface of the stainless steel belt by a mixed rolling/slip contact fatigue mechanism, which promoted spalling and further nucleation and growth of conventional fatigue cracks. Finally, the system lubrication efficiency and the cleaning procedure should be optimised in order to increase the life expectancy of the belt. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|There are two {{principal}} concerns {{that govern the}} use of lubricants in NIF: (1) Airborne molecular contaminants (AMCs) [...] AMCs are known to seriously degrade the performance of sol-gel coated optics. AMCs are produced by the slow outgassing of residues (non-volatile residues or ''NVRs'') of high molecular weight compounds left on surfaces. Lubricants, particularly hydrocarbon lubricants, are a primary source of such NVRs. (2) Particulates [...] Particulates that accumulate on optical surfaces can cause permanent physical damage when exposed to high energy density laser light. <b>Lubricant</b> <b>residues</b> exposed to high energy density light will pyrolyze or decompose and produce carbon particulates. The NIF Approved Materials Database lists several lubricants that have been tested for use in NIF environments. Many of these lubricants were tested according to MELs 99 - 006 (oven outgassing test) or 99 - 007 (vacuum outgassing test). In these tests, the change in percent transmission of light through a sol-gel coated optic placed next to the sample under evaluation is used as the diagnostic. Samples that cause less than 0. 1 % change in optical transmission are deemed suitable for use inside beam enclosures. This testing, however, addresses only the concern associated with AMCs. To assess the issue of particle generation, a flashlamp or ''aerosol'' test is used. In this test a sample with residues is subjected to intense light from the main amplifier flashlamps. The number density of particles per unit volume is measure after each flash. A measurement of an average of fewer than 1000 particles > 0. 5 {micro}m in diameter produced per square foot of exposed surface per flash {{for each of the}} last ten flashes in a series of 60 flashes of light is deemed to be acceptable for polymers. A measurement of an average of fewer than 100 particles > 0. 5 {micro}m in diameter produced per square foot of exposed surface per flash for each of the last ten flashes in a series of 60 flashes of light is deemed to be acceptable for metals...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Accelerated {{rolling contact}} fatigue four-ball tests were {{performed}} on Hot Isostatically Pressed (HIPed) silicon nitride/steel contacts under lubricated condition using a PLINT TE 92 /HS Microprocessor Controlled Rotary Tribometer at a maximum compressive stress of 6. 58 GPa and at a speed of 10, 000 rpm for 135 ~ 200 million stress cycles. Rolling track surfaces were examined by optical microscopy, SEM, 3 -D surface analysis, atomic force microscopy and interference profilometry. Experimental results show that with a initial roughness value Ra from 0. 016 to 0. 094 µm, the surfaces became smoother during testing and surface pitting (10 ~ 20 µm) occurred. For the surfaces with a roughness value Ra from 0. 002 to 0. 008 µm, the surfaces became rougher and <b>lubricant</b> oil <b>residues</b> were deposited {{at the edges of}} rolling track. Some small and shallow surface pitting 2 ~ 3 µm in size was also observed. Some scratch marks left on the surface by the previous lapping process were further extended during testing. Ra and Rq are still most important roughness parameters in relation to rolling contact behaviour. The effects of other surface roughness parameters, such as the shape of the valley, Rsk and Rku are not obvious in this study...|$|R
40|$|Desorption {{electrospray}} ionization (DESI) is an ambient {{surface analysis}} technique {{capable of producing}} 2 D and 3 D images. The ionization mechanism utilizes a pneumatically assisted sprayer to deposit a charged solvent onto a sample surface. Subsequent impacting primary droplets produce ejecting surface secondary droplets containing desolved analytes, which are then detected by a mass analyzer. This thesis explores two fields of application of DESI, forensics and biological tissue analysis. The former involves the analysis of sexual assault evidence, {{in the form of}} condoms, <b>lubricants,</b> and their <b>residues</b> as a potential aid in convicting perpetrators. The latter focuses on investigating the potential use of the zebra fish (Danio rerio) as a model vertebrate organism for future toxicological and biological research. Whole-body 2 D images were created, highlighting areas of interest such as, the brain, spinal cord, liver, and body fat...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{describe}} the failure analysis of an aircraft component subjected to several episodes of in service failure, resulted in {{loss of the}} aircraft safety. Modern aircrafts are provided with mechanical systems which have the task to open not pressurized hatches during landing. The components of such systems are subject to considerable mechanical stresses in harsh environment (presence of moisture and pollutants, significant and sudden temperature variations). The system is constituted by a sliding piston, and related nipple, assisted in the movement by 4 steel balls which act as a ball bearing, the whole system is activated by a preloaded spring. The machined parts, nipple and piston, are made of N 3358 steel (X 3 CrNiMo 13 - 8 - 2), an austenitic stainless steel with very low content of carbon often used in the aerospace. The samples provided by the manufacturer present different types of damage all referable to phenomena relative to the sliding of the piston inside the nipple. Particularly, on the cylindrical sample (piston) were detected circular impressions -probably due to the ball-bearing- and various kinds of longitudinal and helicoidal grooves, due both to the original machining and to the spring. The nipple presented longitudinal grooves and residual of <b>lubricant</b> containing metal <b>residues</b> resulting from the relative sliding. The present paper describes the different damage observed and the microstructure of the material, then are reported the results obtained from the characterization of the material of the samples by means of optical and electronic microscopy, carried out to define the mechanisms involved in the system seizure. In order to define {{the primary cause of}} failure and to propose solutions to be adopted, the results of different tests were compared with system design and working data...|$|R
5000|$|Cartridge Case Preparation Method Two: Using the 220 Russian case, {{lubricate}} {{case and}} full length size in a 6PPC die with the expander button removed (it won't fit!) Insert a small PISTOL primer {{into the case}} to be converted (same size as small rifle primer.) Add a VERY STOUT quantity of a fast burning pistol propellant, such as Bullseye to the case—many other propellants will work, but it MUST be a fast burning pistol propellant. For this cartridge 16 grains of Bullseye works rather well. Melt some paraffin wax into the lid of a jar, and when it solidifies, turn the lid over and press it over {{the neck of the}} loaded blank cartridge, making a seal that will both keep the propellant in the case and provide a very modest resistance to the propellant when it is fired. Generously lubricate the case with [...] "Imperial Sizing Die Wax" [...] or some other VERY high quality case sizing lubricant (the serious benchrest shooters will only use Imperial.) Place the cartridge into the rifle and fire to [...] "fireform" [...] the case. The muzzle blast will be most impressive! Repeat for remaining cases, but don't allow barrel to overheat—if you can't hold the barrel in your hand, it is too hot, so slow down. When finished fireforming, clean rifle chamber to remove any hint of lubricant! Clean necks to remove <b>lubricant</b> and powder <b>residue,</b> then inside lubricate the necks with a Q Tip and Imperial Wax. Run cases thru a 6mm neck expander, which will be slightly oversized. Trim to length of 1.486" [...] (this step may not be necessary.) Inside/outside chamfer the necks. Turn necks to a thickness that will allow, at BARE MINIMUM, 0.001" [...] total clearance in the chamber for the loaded round (it helps to keep the neck turner in a pocket when not actually in use so that its temperature does not vary over the process; otherwise one can get considerable changes in the neck thickness due to heating and cooling of the [...] "neck turner". Remember that we are working in increments of 0.0001" [...] (ten thousandths of an inch) -- when one does the calculations, it is truly impressive how the dimensions of the neck turner can change over a 20 degree F range.) Lubricate the turner mandrel before each new case; again, Imperial is the optimal choice of lubricant. It is important when turning the necks to run the neck turner into the shoulder of the case a wee bit; if this is not done, one will experience the [...] "Dreaded Doughnut" [...] at the juncture of the neck {{to the rest of the}} case after the case is fired, and bullet seating can get very difficult. (Further, with a [...] "doughnut", a loaded round with the projectile seated below doughnut can be larger in diameter than the chamber neck.) Lubricate the case again with Imperial wax. Full length size the case in a 6PPC die with the expander ball in place. Decap primer, clean primer pockets, remove case lube and you are now ready to TRULY LOAD the case.|$|R
