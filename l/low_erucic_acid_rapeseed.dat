40|$|ABSTRACT An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effect of regular Brassica napus, Brassica campestris and low erucic acid (Oro variety) rapeseed oils (RSO) on the performance of laying hens. Feed grade tallow and corn oil were used as controls. The response was measured in terms of egg production, egg size, hatchabihty, and fatty acid and cholesterol levels in egg yolk. The metabolizable energy content of the oils was also determined. When included in the diets of laying hens at levels of 10 and 20 % B. napus and B. campestris RSO exerted a depressing effect on egg production, egg weight, yolk weight and hatchability as compared to the performance of hens on tallow or corn oil. In contrast, the use of <b>low</b> <b>erucic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>rapeseed</b> oil exerted no detrimental effects on reproductive performance thus suggesting that erucic acid is the main factor responsible for the deleterious effects. At the 10 % level of incorporation, B. napus and B. campestris RSO were well utilized by laying hens. Refined B. napus and B. campestris RSO were lower in metabolizable energy than the corresponding crude oils. The total lipid content of the yolk was not influenced by the type or level of dietary fat. Addition of various rapeseed oils to the basal diet altered the fatty acid composition of egg yolk. The average erucic acid content of yolks of hens fed 10 and 20 % B. napus and B. campestris RSO was 0. 6 % whereas birds fed <b>low</b> <b>erucic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>rapeseed</b> oil deposited 0. 2 % erucic acid in the yolk fat.

40|$|Abstract Rhizoremediation is {{a complex}} type of green {{clean-up}} technology that involves both plants and the rhizosphere-associated microorganisms to decompose hazardous compounds. The success of the strategy strongly depends on plant tolerance towards the pollut-ant, as well as plant's interactions with the rhizospheric microbes. The microorganisms may be stimulated by the secreted root exudates, which results in an increased breakdown of contaminants in the rhizosphere. The main goal {{of this study was}} to establish a potential rhizoremediation combination for a diesel-polluted site. Inoculation of plant roots or seeds with indigenous rhizospheric populations is a common approach in the rhizoremediation. However, we introduced hydrocarbon-degrading consortia (M 10, R 3, and K 52) that were pre-viously isolated from crude oil-contaminated soil instead of indigenous microbes. Bioaugmentation with these petroleum degraders was applied to screen four high biomass crop species (Indianmustard, alfalfa, high erucic acid rapeseed, HEAR, and <b>low</b> <b>erucic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>rapeseed,</b> LEAR) for their tolerance towards diesel oil. At no pollution, a promoting effect of M 10 bacteria could be observed on germination and root elongation of all plant species. Moreover, M 10 consortiums increased the ger-mination index at 6, 000 mg diesel oil per kilogram dry soil in the case of Indian mustard, alfalfa, and HEAR. The latter species was found to increment its dry weight upon bioaugmentation with M 10 bacteria and all diesel oil treatments (6, 000 and 24, 000 mg diesel oil per kilo-gram dry soil).

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this thesis are {{to describe the}} problems and procedures followed to contract the crop, segregate the seed and products, and evaluate the oil characteristics of <b>low</b> <b>erucic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>rapeseed.</b> In addition to maintaining seed purity during field production, it was also necessary to develop "in plant" procedures for oil extraction and refining. Special techniques were devised for grading the seed with respect to erucic acid levels and green seed content. Collaborative studies with several domestic oil processors were carried through to final product evaluation but market development work with consumers was not initiated. The adverse nutritional data on high erucic acid oils which {{was presented at the}} International Conference at St. Adele in 1970 indicated the need for an immediate reduction of erucic acid levels in food products. The availability of low erucic acid seed in commercial quantities, and the processing and utilization experiences with the seed and oil, permitted an immediate and complete switch-over to low erucic acid varieties in Canada. This gave Canadian plant breeders a lead time of several years over those in other countries to develop high yielding and more adapted varieties of this new genotype. Canada became the first country to offer low erucic acid seed and oil in world markets. It will take years for other countries to develop and convert to low erucic acid varieties and offer competitive quantities in the world trade. In addition, the Canadian experiment gave other countries confidence that their plant breeders could develop similar varieties and only limited legislative action was instituted against the use of high erucic acid oils until local genotypes with the desired nutritional properties were brought into production...|$|E

The MS data recorded for ammonium adducts ([M+NH 4]+) of TAGs, DAGs, and MAGs were consistent with stepwise fragmentation mechanisms. In the first step, ammonium ion in [M+NH 4]+ donates proton to acylglycerol and ammonia is released. In the second step, FFA is cleaved from protonated TAG, water from protonated 1, 3 -DAG and MAG, both FFA and water from protonated 1, 2 -DAG, hence leading to formation of [DAG]+ ion from TAG and 1, 3 -DAG, [DAG]+ and [MAG]+ ions from 1, 2 -DAG, and [MAG]+ ion from MAG.

40|$|In this paper, I {{analyze the}} price {{transmission}} of canola, or <b>low</b> <b>erucic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>rapeseed,</b> {{in the international}} market and the market power of canola exporting countries {{over one of the}} major importing countries, Japan. Canola oil production in Japan is almost completely dependent on the canola imported from Canada and Australia. The export from Canada generally accounts for more than 80 % in recent years. Does Canada exercise market power over Japan? Does Canada have more market power than Australia in the Japanese canola market? What strategies should Japan have on canola import? To answer these questions, firstly I conducted an empirical analysis of asymmetric price transmission (APT), in which the speed of adjustments of the output price after the input price increases or decreases is different; the existence of APT possibly implies the existence of market power. Widely used threshold autoregressive (TAR) model was applied to test the existence of APT from futures price in Winnipeg to the Canadian FOB price of canola for each country. Significant APT was found in the Canadian canola export to Japan {{in such a way that}} Canada enjoyed long-lasting excess profits over Japan. Moreover, such tendency became more evident in recent years when Canada expanded and diversified export counterparts of canola. To answer the second question and establish the relationship between APT and market power, I estimated the market power of Canada and Australia over Japan when exporting canola. Considering the existence of adjustment process in canola exporting countries, linear-quadratic dynamic duopoly model was employed, in which the parameterized conjectural variations of both exporting countries were estimated. I found that Canada had intermediate level of market power. Meanwhile, I found that Australia had no market power, which means that the Australian canola prices are set at competitive level or price-taking level. Based on these empirical analyses, I drew some implications. The major implication is that Japan should diversify the origins of canola to avoid the use of market power of an exporting country. This paper also contributes in that it constructs the relationship between APT and market power empirically. asymetric price transmission, TAR, market power, canola, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E

The quantity of <b>erucic</b> <b>acid</b> in Brassicaceae oils ranges greatly, from 55 % in Crambe abyssinica to nearly zero in some varieties of Brassica napus var. oleifera. Even more differentiated and peculiar to each species and variety is adaptability to specific climatic and soil conditions.

In addition, seed weight {{was positively correlated with}} oil and protein and negatively correlated with fibre content in both yellow and brown seeded populations. <b>Low</b> <b>erucic</b> <b>acid</b> plants were grown from half seeds of the BC 1 F 2 generation of the interspecific cross of (B. carinata cv. S- 67 X B. juncea Zem 2330) X (B. carinata cv. Dodola). The presence of <b>low</b> <b>erucic</b> alleles in both genomes of these <b>low</b> <b>erucic</b> <b>acid</b> plants may have resulted from either a substitution of all or part of a chromosome or from crossing over between chromosomes of the A and C genomes. The development of low glucosinolate B. carinata was studied in an interspecific cross involving the allylglucosinolate type B. carinata cv. Dodola and the 3 -butenylglucosinolate type B. juncea line 60143. Three allylglucosinolate type BClF 2 plants with an approximately 50 % reduction in allylglucosinolate content were identified following a backcross to the cultivar Dodola. It has been demonstrated that interspecific crossing of selected B. carinata and B. juncea lines can be used in the development of <b>low</b> <b>erucic,</b> reduced glucosinolate B. carinata. A canola quality B. carinata should result from further interspecific crosses with B. napus...|$|R

30|$|This article {{throws a}} light on the recent {{situation}} of oilseed as well as vegetable oil production in the world referring to those in Egypt. Over the last 30  years, the oil crop production in the world increased 240 %, while the increase in area and in yield was 82 and 48 %, respectively. The main oilseed produced {{in the world is}} the soybean whereby it represents more than 50 % of total oil crop production in the world. Most common oilseed types which are currently available in the world are categorized in this article according to the suitability for their oils for human consumption and whether they are considered as a source of some functional ingredients. Oils which are suitable for human consumption include sunflower, canola, soybean, cottonseed, groundnut, linseed, sesame, and moringa oils. The chemical composition of these oils as well as their content of specific functional components have been summarized and compared. In addition, oilseed which yields oils unsuitable for edible purposes such as high <b>erucic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>rapeseed,</b> jatropha, jojoba, and castor oilseed is also assessed for its suitable uses in non-edible purposes.|$|R

Transient myocardial lipidosis characterized by accumulation of fat droplets in myocardial fibers was marked in male and female rats fed oxidized and unoxidized rapeseed oil containing 22. 3 % <b>erucic</b> <b>acid,</b> moderate with <b>rapeseed</b> oil containing 4. 3 % <b>erucic</b> <b>acid</b> and very slight in rats fed rapeseed oil containing 1. 6 % <b>erucic</b> <b>acid.</b> Peak intensity of myocardial lipidosis occurred at three to seven days and regressed thereafter. Focal myocardial necrosis and fibrosis occurred in male rats fed rapeseed oils containing different levels of <b>erucic</b> <b>acid</b> for 112 days. The incidence of myocardial necrosis and fibrosis was markedly lower in female rats, and the incidence of these lesions in either sex was not affected {{by the state of}} oxidation of these oils. In a second experiment, male rats were fed diets containing crude, partially refined or fully refined rapeseed oils. There was no correlation between the number of foci of myocardial necrosis and fibrosis and the state of refinement of the oils, but there were generally fewer lesions in rats fed those oils having the <b>lowest</b> levels of <b>erucic</b> <b>acid...</b>|$|R
40|$|Canola is an edible type of {{rapeseed}} {{that was}} developed in the 1970 ’s [17]. Rapeseed grown prior to that time had moderate levels of <b>erucic</b> <b>acid,</b> which was recognized to be harmful in laboratory rat tests (cholesterol elevation and reduced weight). Breeders in Canada developed <b>rapeseed</b> varieties with <b>low</b> <b>erucic</b> <b>acid</b> content [25]. In 1978, Varieties with less than 2 percent <b>erucic</b> <b>acid</b> were trademarked as “Canola. ” Canola varieties must also have less than 30 micromoles of glucosinolates per gram of oil-free meal. Glucosinolates will negatively affect the consumption of canola meal by animals, thus reducing its feeding value. Canola’s amino acid distribution is very complementary to soybean meal and the two meals are often included in the same feed ration. Feeding studies have shown that animals perform better when fed a mixture of the two meals than when fed either alone [17]. Canola oil has been recognized as the healthiest oil available to consumers with low saturated and high monounsaturated fatty acids and a unique level of the omega 3 fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid. Canola oil is usually blended with other vegetable oils for the production of various solid and liquid cooking oils and salad dressings. Canola proteins are currently not being sold into the human food market...|$|R

40|$|Improving oil {{and protein}} quality {{for food and}} feed {{purposes}} is an important goal in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) breeding programs. Rapeseed contains phytosterols, used to enrich food products, and sinapate esters, which are limiting the utilization of rapeseed proteins in the feed industry. Increasing the phytosterol content of oil and lowering sinapate ester content of meal could increase {{the value of the}} oilseed rape crop. The objective {{of the present study was}} to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for phytosterol and sinapate ester content in a winter rapeseed population of 148 doubled haploid lines, previously found to have a large variation for these two traits. This population also segregated for the two <b>erucic</b> <b>acid</b> genes. A close negative correlation was found between <b>erucic</b> <b>acid</b> and phytosterol content (Spearman’s rank correlation, rs = − 0. 80 **). For total phytosterol content, three QTL were detected, explaining 60 % of the genetic variance. The two QTL with the strongest additive effects were mapped on linkage groups N 8 and N 13 within the confidence intervals of the two <b>erucic</b> <b>acid</b> genes. For sinapate ester content four QTL were detected, explaining 53 % of the genetic variance. Again, a close negative correlation was found between <b>erucic</b> <b>acid</b> and sinapate ester content (rs = − 0. 66 **) and the QTL with the strongest additive effects mapped on linkage groups N 8 and N 13 within the confidence intervals of the two <b>erucic</b> <b>acid</b> genes. The results suggests, that there is a pleiotropic effect of the two <b>erucic</b> <b>acid</b> genes on phytosterol and sinapate ester content; the effect of the alleles for <b>low</b> <b>erucic</b> <b>acid</b> content is to increase phytosterol and sinapate ester content. Possible reasons for this are discussed based on known biosynthetic pathways...|$|R
