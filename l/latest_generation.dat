5|$|The V7 {{client is}} {{the seventh and}} <b>latest</b> <b>generation</b> of the Folding@home client software, and is a full rewrite and {{unification}} of the prior clients for Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. It was released on March22, 2012. Like its predecessors, V7 can run Folding@home in the background at a very low priority, allowing other applications to use CPU resources as they need. It is designed to make the installation, start-up, and operation more user-friendly for novices, and offer greater scientific flexibility to researchers than prior clients. V7 uses Trac for managing its bug tickets so that users can see its development process and provide feedback.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936 presented Gibraltar with major security concerns, as it was initially {{on the front lines}} of the conflict. The ultimately successful rebellion led by General Francisco Franco broke out across the Strait in Morocco, and the Spanish Republican government sought on several occasions to regain control of the Nationalist-controlled area around Algeciras. Although Gibraltar was not directly affected by the fighting, the war caused significant disruption. An undetermined number of Spanish refugees, perhaps as many as 10,000 persons, fled to Gibraltar, resulting in severe overcrowding. A Non-Intervention Patrol was mounted by the Royal Navy, operating from Gibraltar, to prevent foreign military aid reaching the belligerents in Spain. In May 1937, one of the ships involved in the patrol, the destroyer HMS Hunter, hit a Nationalist mine and had to be towed back to Gibraltar with eight of her crew dead. The Spanish Civil War had a deep impact on Gibraltarian society. On one hand, the British authorities, the Anglican and Catholic churches and the Gibraltarian moneyed class supported the Nationalists in the War, while the working class sided with the Republicans. With Europe sliding towards a general war, the British Government decided to strengthen Gibraltar's defences and upgrade the naval base to accommodate the <b>latest</b> <b>generation</b> of battleships and aircraft carriers. A Gibraltar Defence Force (now the Royal Gibraltar Regiment) was established in March 1939 to assist with home defence.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Telomere {{shortening}} is a cell-intrinsic {{mechanism that}} limits cell proliferation by induction of DNA damage responses resulting either in apoptosis or cellular senescence. Shortening of telomeres {{has been shown}} to occur during human aging and in chronic diseases that accelerate cell turnover, such as chronic hepatitis. Telomere shortening can limit organ homeostasis and regeneration in response to injury. Whether {{the same holds true for}} pancreas regeneration in response to injury is not known. METHODS: In the present study, pancreatic regeneration after acute cerulein-induced pancreatitis was studied in <b>late</b> <b>generation</b> telomerase knockout mice with short telomeres compared to telomerase wild-type mice with long telomeres. RESULTS: <b>Late</b> <b>generation</b> telomerase knockout mice exhibited impaired exocrine pancreatic regeneration after acute pancreatitis as seen by persistence of metaplastic acinar cells and markedly reduced proliferation. The expression levels of p 53 and p 21 were not significantly increased in regenerating pancreas of <b>late</b> <b>generation</b> telomerase knockout mice compared to wild-type mice. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that pancreatic regeneration is limited in the context of telomere dysfunction without evidence for p 53 checkpoint activation...|$|R
40|$|Eukaryotic cells undergo {{arrest and}} enter {{apoptosis}} {{in response to}} short telomeres. T cells from <b>late</b> <b>generation</b> mTR(-/-) mice that lack telomerase show increased apoptosis when stimulated to enter the cell cycle. The increased apoptosis was not inhibited by colcemid, indicating that the response did not result from breakage of dicentric chromosomes at mitosis. The damage response protein gamma-H 2 AX localized to telomeres in metaphases from T cells and fibroblasts from mTR(-/-) cells with short telomeres. These {{data suggest that the}} major mechanism for induction of apoptosis in <b>late</b> <b>generation</b> mTR(-/-) cells is independent of chromosome segregation and that loss of telomere function through progressive telomere shortening in the absence of telomerase leads to recognition of telomeres as DNA breaks. ...|$|R

25|$|The new Insight {{includes}} Honda’s {{fifth and}} <b>latest</b> <b>generation</b> of its Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) hybrid system.

Honda states that this configuration is less complex, lower cost, and compact enough to accommodate a wide range of vehicle sizes when compared to competing hybrid powertrains. Honda has used previous generations of this IMA system on all of its production hybrid vehicles including the original Insight, Civic Hybrid, and Accord Hybrid. Advanced development has allowed the Insight’s IMA system to be 19 percent smaller and 28 percent lighter than the previous generation IMA used in the existing Civic Hybrid.|$|E
40|$|Mice {{deficient}} for {{the mouse}} telomerase RNA (mTR-/-) and lacking telomerase activity {{can only be}} bred for approximately six generations due to decreased male and female fertility and to an increased embryonic lethality associated with a neural tube closure defect. Although <b>late</b> <b>generation</b> mTR-/- mice show defects in the hematopoietic system, they are viable to adulthood, only showing a decrease in viability in old age. To assess the contribution of genetic background {{to the effect of}} telomerase deficiency on viability, we generated mTR-/- mutants on a C 57 BL 6 background, which showed shorter telomeres than the original mixed genetic background C 57 BL 6 / 129 Sv. Interestingly, these mice could be bred for only four generations and the survival of <b>late</b> <b>generation</b> mTR-/- mice decreased dramatically with age as compared with their wild-type counterparts. Fifty percent of the generation 4 mice die at only 5 months of age. This decreased viability with age in the <b>late</b> <b>generation</b> mice is coincident with telomere shortening, sterility, splenic atrophy, reduced proliferative capacity of B and T cells, abnormal hematology and atrophy of the small intestine. These results indicate that telomere shortening in mTR-/- mice leads to progressive loss of organismal viability...|$|R

25|$|X-ray {{computed}} tomography (CT), or Computed Axial Tomography (CAT) scan, is a helical tomography technique (<b>latest</b> <b>generation),</b> which traditionally produces a 2D {{image of the}} structures in a thin section of the body. In CT, a beam of X-rays spins around an object being examined and is picked up by sensitive radiation detectors after having penetrated the object from multiple angles. A computer then analyses the information received from the scanner's detectors and constructs a detailed image of the object and its contents using the mathematical principles {{laid out in the}} Radon transform. It has a greater ionizing radiation dose burden than projection radiography; repeated scans must be limited to avoid health effects. CT is based on the same principles as X-Ray projections but in this case, the patient is enclosed in a surrounding ring of detectors assigned with 500-1000 scintillation detectors (fourth-generation X-Ray CT scanner geometry). Previously in older generation scanners, the X-Ray beam was paired by a translating source and detector. Computed tomography has almost completely replaced focal plane tomography in X-ray tomography imaging.|$|E

25|$|The {{adoption}} of high power fiber lasers as an industrial material processing tool has been ongoing {{for several years}} and is now expanding into other markets including the medical and scientific markets. One key enhancement enabling penetration into the scientific market has been the improvements in high finesse fiber amplifiers, which are now capable of delivering single frequency linewidths (<5nbsp&kHz) together with excellent beam quality and stable linearly polarized output. Systems meeting these specifications, have steadily progressed {{in the last few years}} from a few Watts of output power, initially to the 10s of Watts and now into the 100s of Watts power level. This power scaling has been achieved with developments in the fiber technology, such as the {{adoption of}} stimulated brillouin scattering (SBS) suppression/mitigation techniques within the fiber, along with improvements in the overall amplifier design.
