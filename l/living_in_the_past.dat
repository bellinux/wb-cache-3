25|$|Dana's and Kevin's happy reunion is short-lived, as Kevin has a {{hard time}} {{adjusting}} to the present after <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> for five years. He shares a few details of his life in the past with Dana: he witnessed stomach-churning atrocities against slaves, traveled farther and farther up north, worked as a teacher, helped slaves escape and had to grow up a beard to disguise himself from a lynch mob. Disconcerted that he does not feel happy to be back home, he grows angry and cold. Deciding to let him work his feelings out for himself, Dana packs a bag in case she time travels again.|$|E
500|$|Another song, [...] "Wond'ring Again" [...] was {{recorded}} in early sessions in 1970 and considered for release on the album before Anderson decided to drop it from the final track listing. It was subsequently released on the compilation album, <b>Living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Past,</b> in 1972. However, elements of the song—essentially its coda—were included on Aqualung as [...] "Wond'ring Aloud". [...] Glenn Cornick played bass on the song and says it is his favourite song he recorded with the band. Cornick also played bass on early studio recordings of [...] "My God" [...] and [...] "a couple of other songs", {{though he did not}} say which they were.|$|E
500|$|Burns's {{walk through}} the {{supermarket}} {{was based on a}} false rumor that George H. W. Bush visited a store and was confused by the scanner and, in the original draft for the episode, Burns met Bush while there. When bidding farewell to the hippie Mr. Burns says [...] "Shine On You Crazy Diamond" [...] a reference to Pink Floyd's song of the same name. The hippie responds by saying that Burns needs to stop <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> The voice of the hippie is based on Dennis Hopper's character in Apocalypse Now. [...] "Achy Breaky Heart", a song by Billy Ray Cyrus, is played at the old folks' home. The scene where Mr. Burns chases Lisa through town is a spoof of the opening to the TV series That Girl. The scene where Lisa runs through the streets proclaiming recycling as evil spoofs the finales of Soylent Green and the original The Invasion of the Body Snatchers.|$|E

500|$|In early 1964, Wilson {{began his}} {{breakaway}} from beach-themed music. That November, Melody Maker reported that Love {{and the group}} wanted to look beyond surf rock and avoid <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> or resting on the band's laurels. When Wilson resigned from touring in order to focus on songwriting and producing, {{the rest of the}} band assumed that he would continue making music that their audiences expected of them. [...] Although The Beach Boys Today! and Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!) (both released in 1965) were more sophisticated and elaborate than previous albums, they were still within the realm of acceptability for the band, producing a reasonable level of record sales and chart activity. This was not the case for the next two album projects recorded over 1966 and 1967, where Wilson's bandmates were not entirely supportive of his new creative ambitions. Wilson was also encumbered by pressure from Capitol Records and the group's fanbase. While the band's contemporaries grew more intellectually aware, Capitol continued to bill the Beach Boys as [...] "America’s Top Surfin' Group!", expecting Wilson to write more surfing material for the yearly summer markets, despite his growing disinterest.|$|E
500|$|During May 1921, Chapman met Gertrude ("Beet" [...] or [...] "Beety") Lowry, {{the sister}} of Tom Lowry, a cricketer from New Zealand who played for Cambridge and Somerset {{and went on to}} captain his country. The couple met again when Chapman toured New Zealand in 1922–23, and became engaged. At the end of the 1924–25 Australia tour, they married and {{returned}} to England together. The wedding was widely reported and {{until the end of the}} decade the couple were heavily involved in social events. They were popular guests at functions, and became notable figures in the fashionable society of the upper classes. In 1923, Chapman joined a Kent brewery, Mackeson, then owned by H & G Simonds. The brewery was later sold to the Kent brewer Jude, Hanbury & Co which became part of Whitbread. [...] His wife believed that his choice of a career working in the alcohol trade made his life difficult and contributed to his heavy drinking. The social duties associated with his job also contributed to his increased weight and failing fitness in the later part of his cricket career. Further problems arose through his fame; as he wanted to keep people happy, he drank frequently and attended many social functions. Cricket writer Ivo Tennant believes that Chapman's [...] "taste for conviviality was his undoing". He always appeared happy, but Gibson observes [...] "that is the way some men disguise their unhappiness", and Lemmon suggests that Chapman was seeking acceptance and felt lonely at heart. According to Lemmon, by the end of the Second World War, Chapman was largely <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> and that [...] "mentally he was still in the happy days of University cricket." ...|$|E

Not the shadow of a doubt occurred to her that the summons to her brother's bedside was genuine. The hand that held the letter dropped heavily into her lap; she became pale, and old, and haggard in a moment. Thoughts, far removed from her present aims and interests; remembrances that carried her back to other lands than England, to other times than the time of her life in service, prolonged their inner shadows to the surface, and showed the traces of their mysterious passage darkly on her face. The minutes followed each other, and still the servant below stairs waited vainly for the parlor bell. The minutes followed each other, and still she sat, tearless and quiet, dead to the present and the future, <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b>|$|E
