40|$|The present paper {{presents}} an in-vehicle system for traffic violation alert and management. The system hardware {{consists of a}} combination of an on-board computer vision system for traffic sign detection and recognition with a data recorder device for traffic violation alert and management. At present, traffic violations are only focused on three signs: namely speed <b>limit,</b> <b>stop</b> sign, and forbidden turning. The system is designed to warn drivers about potential traffic violations by emitting acoustical messages through vehicle loudspeakers. These messages are issued with sufficient notice to provide the driver with enough time to react to the oncoming traffic situation. However, when a traffic violation is committed, the corresponding offence information such as vehicle speed, GPS location, and other driving parameters, are saved in a database for off-line analysis. In addition, an auxiliary application permits the registered traffic violations to be represented as a standard Google Earth map. The prototype was tested in a real scene under different lighting conditions and showed reasonable results. No data (2011...|$|E

40|$|Inverse {{dynamics}} is {{the most}} comprehensive method that gives access to the net joint forces and moments during walking. However {{it is based on}} assumptions (i. e., rigid segments linked by ideal joints) and it is known {{to be sensitive to the}} input data (e. g., kinematic derivatives, positions of joint centres and centre of pressure, inertial parameters). Alternatively, transducers can be used to measure directly the load applied on the residuum of transfemoral amputees. So, the purpose of this study was to compare the forces and moments applied on a prosthetic knee measured directly with the ones calculated by three inverse dynamics computations - corresponding to 3 and 2 segments, and "ground reaction vector technique" - during the gait of one patient. The maximum RMSEs between the estimated and directly measured forces (i. e., 56 N) and moment (i. e., 5 N m) were relatively small. However the dynamic outcomes of the prosthetic components (i. e., absorption of the foot, friction and <b>limit</b> <b>stop</b> of the knee) were only partially assessed with inverse dynamic methods. © 2009 Elsevier B.

40|$|AbstractThe {{ability to}} detect an {{incoming}} visual stimulus is enhanced by knowledge of stimulus location (orienting of visuospatial attention [1]). Although the brain mechanisms at {{the basis of this}} enhancement are not yet fully clarified, there is evidence that orienting of attention is accompanied by the activation of oculomotor circuits [2 – 6]. It remains unclear, however, whether this oculomotor activity is an epiphenomenon or is functionally related to the attentional process. Attentional benefits are usually measured by the classical Posner paradigm [7]. When subjects fixate centrally and are requested to detect a visual stimulus that could appear in an attended or unattended location, they react faster to stimuli appearing in the attended one. Here, we demonstrate that in monocular vision visuospatial attention was significantly modulated by the position of the eye in the orbit. When the screen was placed 40 ° to the right or to the left of subjects' sagittal plane, attentional benefits for stimuli appearing in subjects' temporal spatial hemifield dramatically decayed, even if the retinal stimulation was exactly the same as in the classical paradigm. The finding that eyes and attention show a common <b>limit</b> <b>stop</b> point supports their close functional coupling...|$|E

40|$|The energy-recycling {{artificial}} {{foot was}} comprised of six component groups: the attachment interface, the toe assembly, the heel assembly, the primary compression spring, the heel clutch, and the toe latch (cf. Figure 2). The interface component attached to the prosthesis simulator boot through a standard prosthetic pyramid adaptor (Figure S 1). The one-way heel clutch acted between the heel assembly and the interface component, allowing the heel to rotate freely in plantar-flexion (compressing the spring) but locking when forced {{in the opposite direction}} (unless released by motor actuation). The toe latch acted between the toe assembly and the interface component, and prevented the toe assembly from rotating in plantar-flexion unless unlatched. During preload (about 25 - 40 % stride), the torque acting on the toe assembly increased as the center of pressure advanced forward and ground reaction forces increased, eventually overcoming the torque of the primary compression spring and pushing the toe assembly against a <b>limit</b> <b>stop.</b> This relieved the toe latch of load, so that a motor could move it to effectively release the toe assembly. During push-off, the primary compression spring was then allowed to force the toe assembly through plantar-flexion, returning stored energy. Simultaneously, the carbon fiber toe spring returned energy that was stored during preload. At the onset of swing, the foot then reset into the ready position by unlocking the heel clutch (cf. Figure 2) ...|$|E
40|$|Traffic signage {{detection}} and recognition are essential {{components in the}} intelligent vision based transportation system by which in-vehicle is able to recognize the traffic signage in various shapes and interpret the contents such as speed <b>limit,</b> <b>stop,</b> and yield. The main challenge of traffic signage {{detection and}} recognition {{is to find a}} way to extract specific information from an image and classify it to the right category. Since the traffic signage images may contain shading and noise, the quality of the images can be varied from one to another. Besides, machine learning kernel for signage recognition is compute-intensive and requires extremely long precessing time to classify an image. In this project, an intelligent traffic signage detection and recognition system which uses k-means as signage detection and support vector machine (SVM) as classification model is proposed. The objective of this project is to develop a color segmentation algorithm which is invariant to different illumination levels and to optimized the performance of recognition algorithm in term of speedup. The new model has successfully implemented in the software environment to compared its performance with existing works. Experimental results show an overall detection rate of 97. 6 % is achieved. The linear kernel outperforms the RBF kernel by 3 % with 92 % of correct classification rate. Combining all the modules, the single frame processing time is successfully speedup by 333 x and the memory utilization is reduced by 99. 8 %. The proposed method has excelled the previous works and is preferable for future hardware implementation...|$|E
40|$|The {{experience}} of operating oil wells {{showed that the}} weak point of tubing is a connecting thread. Currently, the pipe thread of the specified class is made using the technology of cutting. The process of cutting a thread leads to waste metal chips and cutting fibers. Therefore the idea arose to make a thread by the method of pressure shaping. The aim was to study the possibility for full filling of the threaded matrix profile. The study was conducted by means of mathematical modeling in the software complex DEFORM. The impact of technological and geometrical factors {{on the process of}} form change was in detail analyzed. Thus, a work-piece material was specified to be continuous, isotropic, homogeneous, viscous-plastic and a tool material was set as a hard one. The friction was speci-fied according to Prandtl-Siebel law with the friction factor of 0. 3. The thread profile has been replaced by the annular grooves of the similar profile. The task was considered to be axisymmetric. Scientific novelty of received results consists in revealed regularities of the plastic de-formation process of the work-piece when forming a profile of the conical thread on the pipe in the process of its expansion with a conical punch. The simulation allowed us to obtain information about the stress-strain state of the work-piece and tool, {{about the nature of the}} metal flow during deformation, and about the strength parameters of the process. In particular, it was found that the work-piece metal is displaced along the pipe axis both in punch movement direction and in the opposite one. Thus, a mechanical end burr is formed. The article shows that to remove a mechanical end burr requires insertion of extra <b>limit</b> <b>stop</b> housing. The article also analyses distribution of stresses arising in the matrix at the final moment of deformation. It was proved that the highest stresses occur in the hollows of the threaded part of matrix. Thus, their absolute value does not exceed 470 MPa that is quite acceptable for the materials used in the production of stamps. Research has been proven a principle possibility to have the external conical pipe thread by expansion with a conical punch. </p...|$|E
