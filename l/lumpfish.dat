50|$|Fisheries in Iceland and Greenland are {{the main}} {{contributors}} to the worldwide catch of <b>lumpfish.</b> Historically, Norway and Canada also contributed significant amounts but due to {{a decrease in the}} price of salted roe, and a severe population decline in Canada, the contribution from these countries has decreased. Denmark and Sweden have also contributed but the amount has been low in comparison with the other countries. Female fish {{are the main}} target for the fishery which utilizes the roe to make <b>lumpfish</b> caviar. <b>Lumpfish</b> are targeted close to the shore, where they come to spawn, using small fishing boats (generally less than 15 m) with large mesh gillnets. Due to the smaller size of the male, very few are caught in the large meshes. Traditionally, the roe would be removed at sea and the bodies disposed of. In Iceland, it is now mandatory for the bodies to be landed; these are now frozen and exported, mainly to China.|$|E
5000|$|The Greenland shark is an apex {{predator}} {{and mostly}} eats fish. It {{has never been}} observed hunting. Recorded fish prey have included smaller sharks, skates, eels, herring, capelin, Arctic char, cod, redfish, sculpins, <b>lumpfish,</b> wolffish, and flounder.|$|E
5000|$|Harrington Harbour (...) {{was founded}} {{near the end}} of the 19th century by {{fishermen}} from Newfoundland. The primary activity is commercial fishing for crabs, lobster, turbot, halibut, cod, and <b>lumpfish.</b> Its population in the Canada 2011 Census was 261.|$|E
50|$|Lumpsuckers or <b>lumpfish</b> {{are mostly}} small scorpaeniform marine fish {{of the family}} Cyclopteridae. They {{are found in the}} cold waters of the Arctic, North Atlantic, and North Pacific oceans. The {{greatest}} number of species are found in the North Pacific.|$|E
50|$|The New Zealand <b>lumpfish,</b> Trachelochismus pinnulatus, is a {{clingfish}} of {{the family}} Gobiesocidae, found all around New Zealand including the Three Kings Islands, from low water to about 12 m, on rocky coastlines. Its length is up to 10 cm.|$|E
50|$|Cyclopsis tentacularis is {{a species}} of <b>lumpfish</b> native to the Sea of Okhotsk. It occurs at depths of from 12 to 140 m. This species grows to a length of 7.1 cm SL. This species is the only known member of its genus.|$|E
50|$|The {{next stage}} {{is finding a}} {{secondary}} or intermediate host, a demersal fish like a flounder or <b>lumpfish</b> which is often stationary and therefore easy to catch. The copepodid have only a day to find such a fish and attach themselves to its gills.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, {{the term}} caviar refers only to roe from wild {{sturgeon}} in the Caspian Sea and Black Sea (Beluga, Ossetra and Sevruga caviars). Depending on the country, caviar {{may also be}} used to describe the roe of other fish such as salmon, steelhead, trout, <b>lumpfish,</b> whitefish, carp, and other species of sturgeon.|$|E
5000|$|The roe of Cyclopterus lumpus (the {{lumpsucker}} or <b>lumpfish</b> to most Europeans {{and people}} living along the East Coast of the United States), known as stenbider (literally [...] "stone biter") in Danish, is used extensively in Scandinavian cuisine. The roe {{is also used}} as an affordable alternative to the caviar produced by sturgeons.|$|E
50|$|Also, {{almost all}} common eider in the Murmansk region breed in the reserve. The sea ducks prefer to nest on {{treeless}} islands. High numbers of fish - particularly cod, haddock, and <b>lumpfish,</b> are a draw for the waterfowl. Characteristic mammals {{of the reserve}} include moose, brown bear, fox, hare, squirrel, marten, and ermine. Common birds include black grouse, ptarmigan, kestrel, and large owls.|$|E
50|$|Cyclopterus lumpus, the {{lumpsucker}} or <b>lumpfish,</b> is {{a species}} of marine fish in the family Cyclopteridae (lumpsuckers). It is {{the only member of}} the genus Cyclopterus. It is found in the North Atlantic and adjacent parts of the Arctic Ocean, ranging as far south as Chesapeake Bay (rare south of New Jersey) on the North American coast and Spain on the European coast.|$|E
5000|$|A {{proprietary}} drum {{filtering system}} removes lice and eggs during grading and harvesting. A {{variety of methods}} to control sea lice have been researched and implemented including the breeding and deployment of cleaner fish (wrasse and <b>lumpfish)</b> which feed on sea lice. Chemical treatments have been used frequently in the past. With all information being available on SEPA's Scottish Pollutant Release Inventory.|$|E
50|$|Skjálfandi bay is an {{excellent}} place for fishing, especially for cod and <b>lumpfish,</b> so {{it is from the}} sea that most inhabitants take their living. The soil is very fertile, so they also practice agriculture. The inhabitants are completely autonomous, and almost all they do is for their own consumption. Every house had a cow for milking and some sheep and hens.|$|E
50|$|The Liparidae, {{commonly}} known as snailfish or sea snails, are a family of scorpaeniform marine fishes. Widely distributed from the Arctic to Antarctic Oceans including the northern Pacific, the snailfish family contains about 30 genera and 410 species. They {{are closely related to}} the sculpins of the family Cottidae and the <b>lumpfish</b> of the family Cyclopteridae. Snailfish are sometimes included within the latter family.|$|E
50|$|Stjerneskud (lit. {{shooting}} star). On {{a base of}} buttered toast, {{two pieces}} of fish: a piece of steamed white fish (mostly plaice) on one half, a piece of fried, breaded plaice or rødspætte on the other half. On top is piled a mound of shrimp, which is then decorated {{with a dollop of}} mayonnaise, sliced cucumber, caviar or blackened <b>lumpfish</b> roe, and a lemon slice.|$|E
50|$|Stenbitsrom, the roe of <b>lumpfish</b> is {{naturally}} a bleak unappetizing gray, but is coloured black (to emulate Black Caviar) or orange (to emulate Löjrom). Stenbitsrom sells in much larger volume than Löjrom, {{but it has}} two drawbacks: it tastes little more than its salt and artificial additives, and the colour additives tend to bleed into {{other parts of the}} food you serve it with (such as a boiled egg), or to discolour the porcelain dish.|$|E
50|$|When they locate such a fish, they capture it with {{grasping}} hooks at {{the front}} of their body. They penetrate the fish with a thin filament which they use to suck its blood. The nourished cod worms then progress via four moults from the naupliar stage to the mature chalimus stage. At this point the males transfer sperm to the females. Both sexes develop swimming setae, detach from the flounder or <b>lumpfish</b> and again swim freely as pelagic organisms.|$|E
50|$|Several {{aspects of}} their biology (i.e. lack of a swimbladder, its pelvic suction disc) led some {{to believe that they}} were a bottom {{dwelling}} species. <b>Lumpfish</b> are frequently caught in pelagic fishing nets, however, capture in bottom trawls is also common. An investigation using electronic data-storage tags attached to the fish have confirmed that, at least during its breeding migration, this fish will spend time associated with the sea bed, and also some time in the pelagic zone. As the fish came close to breeding, they began to spend a greater amount of time in the pelagic zone. With the lack of a swim bladder, the fish were able to make rapid movements through the water column, moving between surface waters and depths of over 300 m within one day. Data from research surveys and data-storage tags show that adult <b>lumpfish</b> alter their behaviour between night and day with the fish spending more time in the pelagic zone at night and found associated with the seabed during the day, the reasons for this are unclear. This fish is now considered to be a semi-pelagic/semi-demersal fish.|$|E
