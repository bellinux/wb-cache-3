5|$|Four-wheel {{drive was}} decided against {{early in the}} {{development}} process, {{for a number of}} reasons. It was thought rear-wheel drive would be adequate in the majority of situations, that the additional complexity of the four-wheel drive system would hinder the development process and potentially be problematic for the customer. FF Developments were contracted to provide the gearbox/transaxle assembly, modifying their four-wheel drive transaxle assembly from the XJ220 concept into a pure rear-wheel drive design for the production car. A five-speed gearbox is fitted; a six-speed gearbox was considered but deemed unnecessary, as the torque characteristics of the engine made a sixth gear redundant. The transaxle featured a viscous coupling <b>limited</b> <b>slip</b> <b>differential</b> to improve traction.|$|E

25|$|A {{mechanical}} <b>limited</b> <b>slip</b> <b>differential</b> (LSD) {{is considered}} essential for drifting. Drifting {{with an open}} or viscous differential in a sustained slide generally yields relatively less impressive results. All other modifications are secondary to the LSD.|$|E
5000|$|Equalise {{the torque}} better between the driveshafts {{by using a}} low {{friction}} differential. The torque difference is zero if the differential is frictionless, and <b>limited</b> <b>slip</b> <b>differentials,</b> intended to increase power transfer, actually make torque steer much worse. For this reason, <b>limited</b> <b>slip</b> <b>differentials</b> by automobile transmission manufacturers like Quaife, Torsen, TrueTrac, Gold Trac have not been much used until recently, and require other measures to be implemented, such as careful positioning of suspension pivot points and driveshaft CV joints, {{in order to keep}} the resultant torque steer to a manageable amount. <b>Limited</b> <b>slip</b> <b>differentials</b> do not improve cornering, or steering feel, however they will improve power transfer in situations where one wheel experiences limited adhesion, and so may improve overall performance.|$|R

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Mechanical <b>limited</b> <b>slip</b> <b>differentials</b> provide a low cost {{traction}} solution. However, their passive nature {{means that they}} cannot adapt to different scenarios and their yaw moment generation potential cannot be used for vehicle handling or stability control. Active <b>limited</b> <b>slip</b> <b>differentials</b> are becoming popular as {{they are able to}} exploit this potential and also achieve a better traction compromise due to their ability to adapt to different scenarios. This paper describes the development of a control algorithm for an ALSD fitted to a RWD sports saloon vehicle...|$|R
25|$|The new Chrysler-built A833 four-speed manual {{transmission}} was offered {{together with a}} Hurst shifter. Another new option was the Sure-Grip <b>limited</b> <b>slip</b> <b>differential,</b> which was touted as a bad-weather safety feature and also offered traction benefits in performance driving.|$|E

Vehicles specially ordered with any HSV optional extras received a Holden-by-Design individually numbered build plate in the engine bay.|$|E
25|$|The GRMN 86 Concept is {{a version}} of Toyota 86 that {{incorporates}} the technical expertise gained through the 24 Hours Nürburgring endurance race, achieving optimal vehicle weight reduction, a lower center of gravity, an enhanced powertrain and improved body rigidity. It included FA20 engine, 6-speed manual transmission, 215/40R17 tires, carbon fiber engine cover, roof, rear hatch, diffuser, side skirt, tail wing, seats; polycarbonate windows, reinforced engine parts, oil cooler, rewritten ECU, mechanical <b>limited</b> <b>slip</b> <b>differential.</b>|$|E
50|$|Dimethicone is {{also the}} active {{silicone}} fluid in automotive viscous <b>limited</b> <b>slip</b> <b>differentials</b> and couplings. This is usually a non-serviceable OEM component but can be replaced with mixed performance results due to variances in effectiveness caused by refill weights or non-standard pressurizations.|$|R
50|$|Quadra-Drive II {{uses the}} New Venture Gear NV245 {{transfer}} case mated to {{front and rear}} axles containing electronic <b>limited</b> <b>slip</b> <b>differentials</b> or ELSDs. Jeep added traction control in 2005 and starting in 2011 only a rear ELSD is offered, while the front has an open differential.|$|R
50|$|Quaife's {{signature}} {{product is}} its line of automatic torque biasing differentials, {{a form of}} <b>limited</b> <b>slip</b> <b>differentials</b> that employ helical gears rather than clutch mechanisms that are controlled either mechanically or by computers. These differentials are usually available as aftermarket items, but for some models are specified by automobile manufacturers as OEM equipment.|$|R
25|$|As an option, {{an active}} <b>limited</b> <b>slip</b> <b>differential</b> was {{available}} {{instead of the}} standard viscous LSD. This new unit locked the rear differential if it detected that traction was lost {{by one of the}} wheels. A light on the dash also lit up if the LSD engaged. Active LSD came standard on all V-Spec R33 GT-R Skylines and was also available on some ECR33 GTS-25t models; these can be identified by the A-LSD and SLIP lights on the tachometer.|$|E
25|$|The {{drive train}} {{delivered}} power to all four wheels using an electronically controlled all-wheel-drive system Nissan called the ATTESA E-TS. The ATTESA E-TS system used two accelerometers mounted under the center console, which fed lateral and longitudinal inputs to the ECU. The ECU then controlled power delivery {{to the front}} wheels via an electronic torque split converter. In 1995, the ATTESA E-TS Pro was introduced as an option for R33 GT-R customers, and came as standard equipment in GT-R V.spec models. It was later standard equipment in all GT-R models for the R34 Skyline GT-R. The ATTESA E-TS Pro added an Active <b>Limited</b> <b>Slip</b> <b>Differential,</b> which was controlled by the onboard ATTESA computer. This was only for the rear differential, as the front differential remained as a normal <b>Limited</b> <b>Slip</b> <b>Differential.</b> The ATTESA E-TS Pro was also advertised in brochures as adding an electronically controlled 4-channel ABS brake system. Although it {{is not related to}} the all wheel drive system, it uses much of the same sensors, and the same computer. The R32 could be switched from AWD to RWD by removing the 4WD fuse, but R33 and R34 models had to have the front tailshaft removed, or the centre diff can be depressurised for 'towing mode' as specified in the owners manual.|$|E
25|$|The 86, BRZ and FR-S {{are offered}} with two 6-speed transmissions, an {{in-house}} developed Toyota TL70 manual gearbox (based on Aisin AI's AZ6) and an Aisin-Warner A960E automatic transmission, which is modified from that {{used on the}} Lexus IS 250. The latter uses a traditional wet torque converter design, but its software has been engineered to mimic the response of a dual-clutch gearbox. The automatic transmission uses three different modes: Sport, Snow, and Normal. A torque sensing <b>limited</b> <b>slip</b> <b>differential</b> is standard on most models.|$|E

50|$|The Quadra-Drive {{system was}} {{introduced}} in 1999 {{and is based on}} the Quadra-Trac II system but adds <b>limited</b> <b>slip</b> <b>differentials</b> to the front and rear axles to create a four-wheel drive system capable of not only directing torque to the axle with best traction but to the individual wheel on an axle with best traction.|$|R
50|$|In Scout IIs, Dana 30 front axles and Dana 44 {{rear axles}} were {{standard}} until 1974, with front Dana 44 axles {{as a special}} order. After 1974 Dana 44 front and rear axles became standard on all Scout IIs. Available gear ratios were 2.72, 3.07, 3.31, 3.54, 3.73, 4.09, 4.27 and 4.54. Trak-Lok <b>limited</b> <b>slip</b> <b>differentials</b> were optional.|$|R
25|$|BMW, {{working with}} Robert Bosch GmbH and Continental Automotive Systems, {{developed}} {{a system to}} reduce engine torque to prevent loss of control and applied it {{to most of the}} BMW model line for 1992 excluding the l3 series (E30 and some E36 chassis codes) which could be ordered with the winter package, which came with a <b>limited</b> <b>slip</b> <b>differential,</b> heated seats and mirrors. From 1987 to 1992, Mercedes-Benz and Robert Bosch GmbH co-developed a system called Elektronisches Stabilitätsprogramm ("Electronic Stability Programme", trademarked as ESP) to control lateral slippage.|$|E
25|$|In 1994 the Toyota Curren came in two models, the ST206 and the ST207. The ST206 {{had four}} {{different}} trim levels. The FS, XS, ZS and the ZS Sport Selection. The FS and XS models were both {{powered by the}} 140hp 3S-FE engine, whereas the ZS models were powered by the 170-180hp 3S-GE engine. The ZS Sport Selection had {{the added benefit of}} a <b>limited</b> <b>slip</b> <b>differential</b> and a leather steering wheel. The ST207 only came in the XS Touring Selection, which was powered by the 3S-FE and came equipped with four wheel steering and Toyota's active suspension package called TACS.|$|E
25|$|The first Supra Turbo was {{introduced}} in 1987. The inter-cooled, turbo charged version of the 3.0-liter inline 6-cylinder engine boosted power to 230hp (172kW; 233 PS) 240lb·ft (325 N·m). The Turbo model also included an engine oil cooler and integrated rear spoiler. The sports package, which was standard on the Turbo and optional on the base model, included a <b>limited</b> <b>slip</b> <b>differential</b> (LSD), TEMS, and headlamp washers. A new Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) was optional on both models. Also in 87 a new beige/tan color combination was implemented, and only 1000 models were produced with this scheme. Toyota installed its variable induction technology into the DOHC twin turbo 1G-GT called T-VIS and also included it into the 7M-GT engine as well.|$|E
50|$|Several {{variants}} were built. The earlier models (SS130-SS137) were {{powered by}} Perkins V8 engines, with both manual and automatic gearboxes. Later models (SS233-SS245) were powered by Cummins diesel engines. Most appliances had Kirkstall & Eaton axles fitted, {{front and rear}} respectively, some with <b>limited</b> <b>slip</b> <b>differentials.</b> All chassis came {{with a choice of}} 500gpm or 1,000gpm fire pumps, depending on application.|$|R
50|$|During a turn, {{the weight}} of the vehicle shifts away from the inner radius and to the outer radius, {{therefore}} the inner drive-wheel will often lose traction on hard cornering, and especially when accelerating through a curve. Locking <b>differentials</b> and <b>limited</b> <b>slip</b> <b>differentials</b> modify the manner in which torque is distributed to the wheels to reduce wheelspin and improve traction in situations where it is limited.|$|R
50|$|The front {{differential}} in all models was C200. In Australia, the standard rear differential was the H233. Some versions featured <b>limited</b> <b>slip</b> <b>differentials</b> (LSD). A heavy duty model rear differential {{was used in}} some pickup trucks and P40 engined wagons. This was the H260 model differential. In European markets, where less onerous off-road use was expected, the light duty C200 rear differential was installed in some vehicles.|$|R
25|$|Vehicles can be {{customized}} by the player, both visually and performance-wise. In {{addition to}} adding body parts such as hood scoops and body kits, players can add {{multiple layers of}} decals to the vehicles. Upgrades are separated into three categories: engine/power, appearance/aerodynamics and chassis/drivetrain. There is {{a wide range of}} tuning available including tire pressure, which changes during races due to temperature, downforce, gear ratios and <b>limited</b> <b>slip</b> <b>differential.</b> Vehicles can be realistically damaged, from both a cosmetic and a performance standpoint. This changes the way the game is played, as collisions with barriers and other cars will alter the car's handling, top speed and acceleration. More noticeably, spoilers can be knocked off cars, bumpers dangle from their supports, paint can be scraped off and windows can be smashed completely.|$|E
25|$|The final HZ Sandman, {{featured}} {{a choice of}} V8 engines only, along with a four-headlight grille and under bumper front spoiler. According to a GMH Price List dated 25 January 1979, a basic HZ Holden panel van was priced at A$6,076, with the Sandman option package an additional A$1,700. The further optional components also included 5.0-litre V8 engine and a <b>limited</b> <b>slip</b> <b>differential.</b> If a buyer selected every Sandman extra, the price {{would be more than}} 150percent {{of the cost of the}} basic HZ model. By the end of 1979, the Sandman had largely lost its place in the contemporary Australian youth culture—order figures were down and many of the vehicles were now being sold with the stripes and tailgate logos deleted. The Sandman ute was phased out of production prior to the van, the last of which was manufactured around October 1979.|$|E
25|$|HSV {{released}} the HSV Grange model in October 1996 (as part of VS II) {{as a sports}} variant of the Caprice. Manufactured at Elizabeth, South Australia, and finished by HSV at Clayton, Victoria, the Grange was available in 185i and 215i variants, powered by 5.0- and stroked 5.7-litre V8 engines, respectively. The VS Grange was the first Grange produced by HSV, having previously produced Statesman and Caprice models under its own brand. Standard features for the VS II Grange included 17-inch alloy wheels, a ten-speaker sound system with a ten-disc CD stacker, climate control air conditioning, a power adjustable driver's seat (with memory settings), leather upholstery, cruise control, front fog lights, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, remote central locking, power windows and mirrors, telescopic steering wheel adjustment, a trip computer, power sunroof, woodgrain interior trim, an alarm and immobiliser. The 215i variants were also fitted with a Hydratrak <b>limited</b> <b>slip</b> <b>differential.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{body is a}} conventional, but light, unibody or {{monocoque}} construction, with (detachable) {{front and}} rear subframes. The MX-5 also incorporates a longitudinal truss, marketed as the Powerplant Frame (PPF), providing a rigid connection between the engine and differential, minimizing flex and contributing to responsive handling. Some MX-5s feature <b>limited</b> <b>slip</b> <b>differentials</b> and anti-lock braking system. Traction control is an option available on NC models. All models weighed approximately one tonne.|$|R
50|$|The {{vehicle was}} {{designed}} to transport troops and various equipment quickly on road and off-road. It has a chassis frame construction, with a traditional layout of front engine, middle crew compartment, and rear cargo area. Standard features include: power steering, independent all-wheel torsion suspension with hydraulic shock absorbers and stabilizer bars, a transfer case with a locking center <b>differential,</b> <b>limited</b> <b>slip</b> <b>differentials,</b> two-speed transfer case, automatic tire inflation, engine block heater, and electric winch.|$|R
