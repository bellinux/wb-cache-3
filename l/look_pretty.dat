The film was declared a super hit in the first week, breaking the record in Malayalam cinema for opening week gross income, {{though it was not}} received well critically. It was said of Saran that {{all she had to do}} was <b>look</b> <b>pretty.</b> She then enacted her first lead role in a Telugu film after five years, in the commercially successful action-comedy Don Seenu opposite Ravi Teja, where she plays the sister of a mobster. In the opinion of some critics, she stole the show with her dances and romantic scenes.|$|E

I tried to persuade the studio to give me {{something}} different. But every time I went into my argument about how bad a picture was, they'd say, [...] "well, it's making a fortune". That licked me.|$|E
500|$|Following an {{appearance}} {{in an online}} video on feminism, entitled My Choice, {{under the direction of}} Homi Adajania, Padukone took on the role of a headstrong Bengali architect who cares for her hypochondriac father (played by Amitabh Bachchan), in Shoojit Sircar's comedy-drama Piku (2015). Reviews for the film were positive; Tanmaya Nanda of Business Standard praised the film's feminist tone, and wrote that Padukone proves [...] "what she is capable of when given something more to do than <b>look</b> <b>pretty</b> and be the crazy-dance girl at parties". NDTV's Saibal Chatterjee opined that she [...] "holds Piku together with a restrained star turn". With a worldwide gross of over , the film emerged as a box office hit, and garnered Padukone several awards, including second Best Actress awards at Filmfare and Screen.|$|E

500|$|Family friend John T. Ford opened 1,500-seat Ford's Theatre on November 9 in Washington, D.C. Booth {{was one of}} {{the first}} leading men to appear there, playing in Charles Selby's The Marble Heart. In this play, Booth portrayed a Greek {{sculptor}} in costume, making marble statues come to life. Lincoln watched the play from his box. At one point during the performance, Booth was said to have shaken his finger in Lincoln's direction as he delivered a line of dialogue. Lincoln's sister-in-law was sitting with him in the same presidential box where he was later slain; she turned to him and said, [...] "Mr. Lincoln, he looks as if he meant that for you." [...] The President replied, [...] "He does <b>look</b> <b>pretty</b> sharp at me, doesn't he?" [...] On another occasion, Lincoln's son Tad saw Booth perform. He said that the actor thrilled him, prompting Booth to give Tad a rose. Booth ignored an invitation to visit Lincoln between acts.|$|E
500|$|The {{concert was}} {{entitled}} [...] "Money Can't Buy" [...] as no tickets were {{made available for}} purchase publicly; only competition winners and guests with invitations were allowed to attend the show. Additionally, Minogue donated two tickets to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC). These tickets were auctioned at a charity ball for the society's [...] "Full Stop" [...] campaign. The Sydney Morning Herald found it surprising that Minogue chose to perform in an [...] "intimate" [...] setting as she had chiefly embarked on large arena tours in the past. The newspaper felt it was similar to Madonna's decision to perform at a small show at Brixton Academy, London, in 2000. Before the show, Minogue held a media press conference and discussed the development of Money Can't Buy, saying: [...] "It's been pretty intense. I'm trying to <b>look</b> <b>pretty</b> calm {{but it has been}} an intense few weeks leading up to this. There's going to be a few old , but they're not-very-oldies. We're stepping marginally back in time. It's always difficult choosing which songs to play from the new album and then what's going to work. There's a couple of surprises in store and there's a couple of real ‘train spotter' surprises." ...|$|E
500|$|The game's overall {{narrative}} {{was highly}} praised by critics; many considered it compelling, engaging, riveting, and mature, and {{viewed it as}} the standout feature of the game. Some believed that the story had an excellent presentation with decent voice-acting, memorable characters, and atmospheric soundtracks. North's performance was particularly praised. Many critics {{thought it was a}} bold attempt by Yager and that the story about mistakes and consequences allowed the game's narrative to exceed its competitors in terms of quality. Some critics believed that Yager deserves respect for successfully creating a message through the story and delivering it to the player, and trying to do something different. Mitch Dyer of IGN thought that the game's narrative made violence [...] "meaningful", and that the story was unexpectedly good and personal. Some believed the story is impactful and at times shocking, and that the plot would make [...] "Modern Warfare 2s nefarious No Russian <b>look</b> <b>pretty</b> tame". The game's choices were praised for being [...] "powerful" [...] despite not offering a branching storyline. Some critics believed that these choices are provocative, organic, impactful, upsetting, and thematically correct, though unsatisfying and sometimes hollow and binary. The endings of the game were praised. Some critics noted that emotionally Spec Ops: The Line is not a pleasant game.|$|E

500|$|In 2003, Zito {{started off}} with a win against the Mariners. He went 6 innings and allowed an earned run, an RBI single by Olerud in the first inning. In his next start, Zito went 7 innings, struck out 7, walked 4, and allowed one run against Texas. In the process, he became only the fifth A's pitcher to win 10 {{straight}} games, the first since Welch in 1990. On April 18, Zito went nine innings, allowing six hits and no runs in a start against the Rangers. Zito improved to 9–0 in his career against Texas. After the game, Texas manager Buck Showalter said, [...] "I got the feeling he made it <b>look</b> <b>pretty</b> easy. When he {{has that kind of}} command, you can see what happens." [...] Zito struggled in his second-to last start before the All-Star Break on July 8. He allowed seven earned runs and 15 hits against the Devil Rays. The 15 hits allowed were a career high. Devil Rays manager Piniella was stunned by Zito's bad start. He said, [...] "If you'd have told me we'd get 15 hits off Zito in five or six innings, I would have looked at you a little funny." [...] Nevertheless, Zito bounced back in his next start. He went eight innings without surrendering a run against the Baltimore Orioles. Zito was again named to the All Star team, the second time he has been named to the team.|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN called [...] "The Dark Defender" [...] "a very {{satisfying}} {{episode of the}} show" [...] and thought that [...] "so far [...] {{doing a very good}} job" [...] of replicating the tension seen in the first season. He was impressed by Dexter's discoveries about his birth mother and adoptive father, but called Debra's romance with Gabriel a [...] "less successful" [...] storyline. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Tom O'Neil called the episode a [...] "standout" [...] because of the parts of Dexter's past that it explored. He stated that, for regular viewers, [...] "this episode is a real knockout", but for unfamiliar viewers, [...] "this whole Dark Defender bit might <b>look</b> <b>pretty</b> corny". TV Squad's Keith McDuffee believed the revelation of Laura's affair with Harry to be [...] "certainly the most shocking moment of the episode", and thought that [...] "One of the brilliant moments of the season so far was Dexter going after one of his mom's killers." [...] Paula Paige of TV Guide called Dexter's monologue about his hollowness [...] "very moving". She thought that his confrontation with his mother's killer [...] "may {{have been one of the}} best shot [...] in the whole series". Blogcritics Ray Ellis praised the [...] "razor-sharp sense of humor" [...] seen in the episode and thought that [...] "In a season of mostly dreary, bland series, Dexter remains the most daring show on television." [...] Dexter and Jimenez's confrontation was named Hall's best scene by Variety critic Stuart Levine.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from January 7, 1911. It states, [...] "Miss Street's Seminary for Girls has a very ambitious class of pupils. The young athletes, not content with basketball and tennis, aspire to shine in the great American game, and organize a baseball club. They are so satisfied with themselves that they finally send a challenge to Adair College, which has a crowd of husky young athletes in a club that thinks it amounts to something. When the challenge is received, the boys are first angry, then amused. They decide to accept it, {{to have fun with}} the girls. The young women, after some practice, realize that their team, while it may be pretty to look at, is of little real use on the diamond. And the prospect makes them weep. Fortunately for the girls, Jack, the brother of the president, arrives from Harvard. His chum, Jim, is with him. These two young men are baseball stars themselves, and when they are told of the predicament of the girls, they goodnaturedly offer to help them out. The university men disguise themselves as girls, act as battery for the young women, and the college boys, who had looked for a laughable victory, are mowed down, inning after inning, because of the work of pitcher Jack and catcher Jim. The other members of the 'girl' team have nothing to do except <b>look</b> <b>pretty.</b> When the boy athletes have retired from the field vanquished, the girls reward their battery with one kiss - only one - from each of the other seven players." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the fight, Calzaghe called Hopkins one of {{the toughest}} fighters he had ever fought. He said, [...] "I knew this wouldn't <b>look</b> <b>pretty</b> tonight. He's so awkward.
