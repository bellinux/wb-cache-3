5|$|The typical Parthian riding outfit is {{exemplified}} by the famous bronze statue of a Parthian nobleman found at Shami, Elymais. Standing 1.9m (6ft), the figure wears a V-shaped jacket, a V-shaped tunic fastened in place with a belt, <b>loose-fitting</b> and many-folded trousers held by garters, and a diadem or band over his coiffed, bobbed hair. His outfit is commonly seen in relief images of Parthian coins by the mid-1st century BC.|$|E
5|$|On 20 June 2010, 611 C3 Picassos built between January and March 2010 were {{recalled}} due to incorrectly routed fuel pipes, {{which were}} {{believed to have been}} in contact with the heat shield. This fault may have caused chafing and may lead to a fuel leak. The models were built between January and March 2010 and were sold in the UK. On 24 August 2010, all 13,234 Picassos sold in the UK were recalled because the windscreen trim could deteriorate, and could eventually detach, leading to a <b>loose-fitting</b> windscreen.|$|E
5|$|Ancient {{people of}} Chamba {{were known to}} have worn a fine woolen blanket or chadar around the waist, to keep warm in the cold climate. It was often tied or girdled with a band or patka, as {{evidenced}} by some archaeological discoveries in the area depicting this fashion. The Gaddi people have traditionally worn white embroidered caps and <b>loose-fitting</b> white woolen garments known as a chola, tied around the waist with a black wool rope. A local custom in Chamba was to give the Jogi of the Natha sect a cotton maikhal sheet to wear over the head during the Nuwala ceremony to honour Lord Siva. Chamba and the surrounding district have been well documented as being a producer of fine cloth and embroidered dresses for centuries.|$|E
5|$|Molly {{lost her}} {{championship}} to Victoria in a Four-Way Elimination match on February 23, 2004. The feud {{led to a}} Hair versus Title match at WrestleMania XX in March 2004, which Molly lost, resulting in her having her head shaved. Greenwald maintains {{that it was her}} idea to have her head shaved, suggesting the idea to Vince McMahon months before the match occurred because she wanted to do something shocking at WrestleMania. Over the next few months, in storyline, she desperately tried to disguise her bald head using <b>loose-fitting</b> wigs. Later in 2004, Molly feuded with Stacy Keibler, overpowering Stacy on the mat and pinning her in three consecutive occasions, the last one occurring in a number one contender's match.|$|E
5|$|To further aid {{athletes in}} gliding as aerodynamically as possible, they wear a {{one-piece}} fabric bodysuit {{more similar to}} a wingsuit than a ski suit. It is composed of five layers and is both <b>loose-fitting</b> and porous enough to allow up to 52litres of air to enter and 40litres to pass through. This generates yet more lift, but the amount of slack is stringently regulated by the FIS so as to not allow for excessive bagginess and thereby reducing its wingsuit-, sail- or parachute-like properties. In the early 2000s, bodysuits had reached exceptionally baggy proportions, resulting in humorous comparisons to flying squirrels. A ban on these baggy suits came into effect soon after, and today the level of slack for bodysuits is measured by FIS scrutineers before and after each jump: if the amount is exceeded, that athlete is disqualified due to an 'equipment violation'.|$|E
25|$|Swimsuits can be skin-tight or <b>loose-fitting.</b> They {{are often}} lined with {{another layer of}} fabric if the outer fabric becomes {{transparent}} when wet.|$|E
25|$|In Western society, it was Eastern {{culture that}} {{inspired}} French designer Paul Poiret (1879–1944) {{to be one}} of the first to design pants for women. In 1913, Poiret created <b>loose-fitting,</b> wide-leg trousers for women called harem pants, which were based on the costumes of the popular opera Sheherazade. Written by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov in 1888, Sheherazade was based on a collection of legends from the Middle East called 1001 Arabian Nights.|$|E
25|$|It is a <b>loose-fitting</b> tunic, {{generally}} {{made from}} {{two or three}} rectangular pieces of fabric which are then joined together with stitching, ribbons or fabric strips, with an opening for the head and, if the sides are sewn, openings for the arms. Traditional huipils, especially ceremonial ones, are usually made with fabric woven on a backstrap loom and are heavily decorated with designs woven into the fabric, embroidery, ribbons, lace and more. However, some huipils are also made from commercial fabric.|$|E
25|$|Given the {{cultural}} and religious differences within the country, Sudanese clothing varies among the different parts and peoples of Sudan. However, most individual Sudanese wear either traditional or western attire. A traditional garb widely worn in Sudan is the jalabiya, which is a <b>loose-fitting,</b> long-sleeved, collarless ankle-length garment also common to Egypt, Ethiopia and Eritrea. The jalabiya {{is accompanied by a}} large scarf worn by men, and the garment may be white, colored, striped, and made of fabric varying in thickness, depending on the season of the year and personal preferences.|$|E
25|$|Trousers {{of various}} designs were worn {{throughout}} the Middle Ages in Europe, especially by men. <b>Loose-fitting</b> trousers were worn in Byzantium under long tunics, and were worn by many tribes, {{such as the}} Germanic tribes that migrated to Western Roman Empire in the Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages, as evidenced by both artistic sources and such relics as the 4th-century costumes recovered from the Thorsberg peat bog (see illustration). Trousers in this period, generally called brais, varied in length and were often closed at the cuff or even had attached foot coverings, although open-legged pants were also seen.|$|E
25|$|Crank pin and {{crosshead}} bearings carry small cup-shaped reservoirs for oil. These have {{feed pipes}} to the bearing surface that start above the normal fill level, or are kept closed by a <b>loose-fitting</b> pin, {{so that only}} when the locomotive is in motion does oil enter. In United Kingdom practice the cups are closed with simple corks, but these {{have a piece of}} porous cane pushed through them to admit air. It is customary for a small capsule of pungent oil (aniseed or garlic) to be incorporated in the bearing metal to warn if the lubrication fails and excess heating or wear occurs.|$|E
25|$|The {{subjects}} of later paintings impersonating Circe {{have a history}} of sexual experience behind them, starting with “Mary Spencer in the character of Circe” by William Caddick, which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1780. The subject here was the mistress of the painter George Stubbs. A portrait of “Mrs Nesbitt as Circe” by Joshua Reynolds followed in 1781. Though this lady’s past was ambiguous, she had connections with those in power and was used by the Government as a secret agent. In the painting she is seated sideways, wearing a white, <b>loose-fitting</b> dress, with a wand in her right hand and a gilded goblet near her left. A monkey is crouching above her in the branches of a tree and a panther fraternizes with the kitten on her knee. While the painting undoubtedly alludes to her reputation, it also places itself within the tradition of dressing up in character.|$|E
25|$|The early uniforms worn by Mongolian {{troops were}} their {{civilian}} clothing. Typical {{it consisted of}} a long blue padded cotton tunic that was worn which reached down to the ankles along with an ornage sash around the waist. Headgear was either a lambs' wool hat or a colored turban wrapped around the head. The color of the turban varied with each Mongol banner clan having a distinctive one. In addition they wore a leather bandolier for cartridges which was slung over the left shoulder. Some soldiers were dressed in loose fitting cotton jacket and trousers along with a peak cap. In 1936 a new uniform was in use, modeled on the Nationalist Chinese uniform. It included a <b>loose-fitting</b> grey jacket and grey cotton trousers. A peaked grey cotton peaked cap was worn along with it (similar in appearance to those worn by the Russian Imperial Army during World War I). Other uniforms they used included the regular Japanese Army uniform but with Inner Mongolian insignia.|$|E
500|$|The SEALs {{encountered}} bin Laden on {{the third}} floor of the main building. Bin Laden was [...] "wearing the local <b>loose-fitting</b> tunic and pants known as a kurta paijama", which were later found to have €500 and two phone numbers sewn into the fabric.|$|E
500|$|The {{religious}} police mutawa impose {{restrictions on}} women when in public. These restrictions include requiring women {{to sit in}} separate specially designated family sections in restaurants, to wear an abaya (a <b>loose-fitting,</b> full-length black cloak covering the entire body) and to conceal their hair. [...] Women also risk arrest for riding in a vehicle driven by a male who is not an employee or a close male relative. Although there is no written ban on women driving cars, a Saudi driving license is required by law and these are not issued to women. Thus, it is effectively illegal for women to drive, and the ban is enforced by the mutawa. In 2013, Saudi Arabia registered its first female trainee lawyer, Arwa al-Hujaili.|$|E
500|$|A five-minute blooper reel featuring, {{among other}} shots, unintentional pratfalls by Hathaway {{due to the}} high {{stiletto}} heels she had to wear. It also includes gag shots such as a chubby crewmember in <b>loose-fitting</b> clothing walking along the runway at the fashion show, and Streep announcing [...] "I have some nude photographs to show you" [...] at the Paris brunch scene. Unlike most blooper reels, {{it is not a}} collection of sequential takes but rather a fast-paced montage set to music from the film with many backstage shots and a split screenshot allowing the viewer to compare the actual shot with the blooper. The many shots of actors touching their noses are, Rich Sommer says, a game played to assign blame for ruined takes.|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} {{the video}} the {{isolated}} and sad men depart with the doors closing on them. As the final chorus breaks into dance grooves, Madonna comes out of the theater and gives the boy a quick kiss on his lips. Both are clad in <b>loose-fitting</b> gray suits, which gives Madonna an androgynous look. They stroll away playfully in the sunrise, reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin and Jack Coogan in The Kid with the old boss pursuing them and shouting [...] "Come back, come back, we still need you" [...] in Italian. The tension between the visual and the musical dimensions of the video is extremely unsettling according to author Nicholas B. Dirks. Only when she disappears from the carousel and reappears to run away from her patriarchal boss with the young boy, then the music and visuals become comparable.|$|E
500|$|The {{previous}} styles {{were the}} militia uniforms. These consisted {{of everything from}} the more sharp-looking jackets and coats, which resembled the French or Northern Infantry uniforms, to the no-flares [...] "battle-shirt", meant for drilling and battles only. The uniform for these militia units varied by each company through a single county or parish, let alone the country itself. The militia uniforms were a menagerie of colors, from cadet gray, dark blue, and hunter green, to reds, buffs and gold tones. The other variety of CS Army uniform jackets and coats is the Zouave. This jacket {{was meant to be}} <b>loose-fitting</b> and reflect the French-African Zouave units. There were several units to consist of this uniform, including the [...] "Richmond Zouaves" [...] of the 44th Virginia Infantry Regiment, the [...] "Louisiana Tigers" [...] in the 1st Louisiana Special Battalion, and [...] "Coppen's Zouaves" [...] of Louisiana.|$|E
500|$|... "The Railway Guard" [...] {{featured}} Leno in a mad characterisation of {{a railway}} station guard {{dressed in an}} ill-fitting uniform, with an unkempt beard and a whistle. The character was created by exaggerating the behaviour that Leno saw in a real employee at Brixton station who concerned himself in other people's business while, at the same time, not doing any work. [...] "The Shopwalker" [...] was full of comic one-liners and was heavily influenced by pantomime. Leno played {{the part of a}} shop assistant, again of manic demeanour, enticing imaginary clientele into the shop before launching into a frantic selling technique sung in verse. Leno's depiction of [...] "The Waiter", dressed in an oversized dinner jacket and <b>loose-fitting</b> white dickey, which would flap up and hit his face, was of a man consumed in self-pity and indignation. Overworked, overwrought and overwhelmed by the number of his customers, the waiter gave out excuses for the bad service faster than the customers could complain: ...|$|E
500|$|Cox married actor David Arquette in 1999 {{while the}} show was on hiatus between seasons five and six, hence the actress legally changed her full name to Courteney Cox Arquette. The opening credits of the season six premiere [...] "The One After Vegas" [...] {{features}} an inside joke in which Cox's new surname [...] "Arquette" [...] {{is attached to the}} surnames of each cast and crew member. The episode is dedicated to Cox and Arquette, reading, [...] "For Courteney and David, who did get married." [...] Before marrying Cox, Arquette had guest starred in an episode of Friends as Phoebe's love interest. During season 10, Cox got pregnant with her and Arquette's child. At that same time, her character and on-screen husband were going through the process of adopting a child. Like Monica and Chandler, Cox and Arquette had also struggled with conceiving in real life. Although Kudrow's real-life pregnancy had successfully been written into the show, the same could not have been done for Cox because Friends had already long-established that Monica is incapable of having children. Therefore, the crew attempted to conceal Cox's pregnancy using a combination of baggy, <b>loose-fitting</b> costumes and props instead. However, at times the actress' growing belly was still detectable by viewers in spite of the crew's best efforts.|$|E
500|$|In The Observer, Tim Adams complimented {{the opening}} {{sections}} as [...] "nicely layered with the pretensions {{of a particular}} precocious kind of student" [...] but criticised the [...] "predictability" [...] of Mountstuart's [...] "walk-on part in literary history" [...] and ultimately the suspension of disbelief, particularly the Baader-Meinhoff passages, concluding [...] "For all the incident, for all the change he witnesses, Mountstuart never really feels like a credible witness either to history or emotion." [...] Tom Cox in The Daily Telegraph disagreed: he praised the characterisation, calling Mountstuart [...] "a man whose fragile egotism and <b>loose-fitting</b> story has you frequently forgetting you're reading fiction, and even more frequently forgetting you're reading at all." [...] Giles Foden, in The Guardian, found the New York art-scene sections weakest, saying they [...] "puncture the realism Boyd has so carefully built up {{in the rest of}} the novel." [...] Michiko Kakutani agreed that Mountstuart's youth was well evoked, but that the description of his retirement and poverty was [...] "as carefully observed and emotionally resonant". While in the early part of the book [...] "the characters' marionette strings [...] carefully hidden", later Boyd tried to play God, resulting in [...] "an increasingly contrived narrative that begins to strain our credulity." ...|$|E
500|$|Louise Watson, {{writing for}} Screenonline, felt the film's costume and make-up help [...] "convey the full Cinderella {{transformation}} of Austen's heroine. At first the undervalued family martyr, Anne is the wallflower {{who has lost}} her 'bloom'. Her <b>loose-fitting</b> costumes hint at how she has pined away since refusing Wentworth... As she regains her confidence, she blossoms; she dresses becomingly, her eyes sparkle and her features become animated". Paulette Richards argues that the film's [...] "unreliable" [...] male characters, such as Sir Walter, are identified as such by the flamboyant nature of their clothing. This flamboyance is especially clear to modern viewers, {{who live in a}} culture where [...] "real men" [...] are expected to care little for their clothing. Conversely, the film's Wentworth is typically depicted in naval uniforms, which is a contrast to Bryan Marshall's version of the character in the 1971 adaptation. This uniform helps set Wentworth apart from many of the other male characters, allowing him to appear romantic but isolated. Gina and Andrew MacDonald had a similar view of the film, writing that it accurately captures Austen's satire by juxtaposing the upper classes' extravagance in fashion with the virtuous qualities of the Royal Navy. The naval men's profession is emphasised by the frequency of wearing their uniforms, in contrast to other adaptations of the novel.|$|E
500|$|The library, {{which is}} [...] long and [...] wide, {{was built on}} the first floor of a {{free-standing}} building, above common rooms for students and fellows, and largely followed the layout of Thelwall's earlier library. The books were moved to their new location in 1679. The library contains bookcases dating from about 1628, which are decorated with strapwork and were used in the earlier library. The bookcases are [...] long, with hinged desks. Some of the books were secured with chains; these were removed at an unknown date, although some payments for chains were made until 1765. A gallery storey was added, probably in 1691, and a wood-panelled gallery runs the length of the east side. It is reached by [...] "an ingenious and graceful spiral staircase". On the west side of the library, there are nine windows on two levels; on the east side, there are now six on the lower level and four (blocked by gallery bookcases) on the upper level. The layout of the library, as well as the position of an exposed timber, suggests that there was previously a gallery on the west side. If so, it was not used after 1800, when the library was re-arranged. It may have been removed and transferred to St Edern's, Bodedern, along with some woodwork from the chapel after Street's renovations, with other sections of the chapel woodwork re-used in the east gallery– some of the carved patterns in the gallery are identical to those in Bodedern, and some of the gallery panels have been cut to fit their position, or are <b>loose-fitting</b> or upside down, suggestive of repositioning from a previous location.|$|E
500|$|The pre-war Australian Army uniform {{formed the}} basis of that worn by the AIF, which adopted the broad-brimmed slouch hat and rising sun badge. Peak caps were {{initially}} also worn by the infantry, while light horsemen often wore a distinctive emu plume in their slouch hats. A standard khaki [...] was worn by all arms. From 1916 steel helmets and gas masks were issued for use by infantry on the Western Front. A <b>loose-fitting</b> four-pocket service dress jacket was worn, along with baggy knee breeches, puttees, and tan ankle-boots. A heavy woollen greatcoat was worn during cold weather. The uniform was a drab [...] "pea soup" [...] or khaki colour, while all buttons and badges were oxidised to prevent shine. All personnel wore a shoulder title bearing the word [...] "Australia". Rank insignia followed the British Army pattern and were worn on the upper arms (or shoulders for officers). Identical hat and collar badges were worn by all units, which were initially only distinguished by small metal numerals and letters on the shoulder straps (or collars for officers). However, in 1915 a system of Unit Colour Patches was adopted, worn on the upper arm of a soldier's jacket. Wound stripes of gold braid were also authorised to be worn to denote each wound received. Other distinguishing badges included a brass letter [...] "A" [...] which was worn on the colour patch by men and nurses who had served at Gallipoli, blue chevrons representing each year of overseas service, and a red chevron to represent enlistment {{during the first year of}} the war. Uniforms worn by the AFC were similar to those of the rest of the AIF, although some officers wore the double-breasted [...] "maternity jacket" [...] which had been worn at the pre-war Central Flying School. AFC [...] "wings" [...] were worn on the left breast, while an AFC colour patch and standard rising sun badges were also worn.|$|E
