40|$|Open {{crowdsourcing}} competitions {{can provide}} a large repository of data {{which can be used}} to achieve more sustainable product designs. This study looks at the recent General Electric challenge, a competition to minimize the mass of a titanium jet engine <b>lifting</b> <b>bracket,</b> to illustrate the benefits that can be accrued. In the light of current literature the benefits and challenges of crowdsourcing have been considered. Samples of the entrants to the challenge have been compared to identify critical characteristics for interpreting sustainable designs for additive manufacture. Focusing initially on topological optimisation and orientation of the additive manufacture build, critical features have been highlighted. The availability of many CAD designs has been most useful and has potential for future developments. Crowdsourcing as an innovation approach can also be beneficial for both companies and individuals particularly if the entries are open sourc...|$|E
50|$|The {{trails are}} made of {{aluminum}} alloy. They are a single box trail in wishbone shape, and serve three purposes: mobility; stability; and stowage of section equipment. The lunette is the towing pintle that allows the weapon {{to be connected to}} the vehicle. When towing, vehicle has a fixed or seized tow pintle; remove the lock plate located under the lunette. The drawbar has two positions: lowered for travel and raised for firing. There are two <b>lifting</b> <b>brackets</b> to connect slings to when the howitzer is being lifted by helicopter. A third bracket is located on front yoke. The carriage handles are used by crew members to lifting and shifting the howitzer during loading, unloading, and emplacing the howitzer.|$|R

500|$|The T9 had a crew {{of three}} and weighed [...] It was armed with a [...] main gun and a coaxial [...]30-06 Browning M1919A4 machine-gun, {{as well as two}} further machine-guns on the {{right-hand}} side of the bow. The main gun and coaxial machine-gun were mounted in a powered turret, which also had a gun stabilizer installed to allow the gun to be fired when the tank was moving. The T9 was powered by a 162 horse-power [...] six-cylinder, air-cooled Lycoming engine, and the thickness of the armour varied; the front, rear and sides of the hull had a thickness of [...] while the sloped portions of the hull had a thickness of [...] The tank's engine was able to give it a maximum speed of [...] The T9 was not primarily designed to be transported by glider, a significant change from the original request, but instead was to be carried under the belly of a Douglas C-54 Skymaster transport aircraft, using four <b>lifting</b> <b>brackets</b> welded onto each side of the hull of the tank. The turret was designed to be removable so that it could be detached and transported inside the C-54 and reattached once on the battlefield. The loading took six men about twenty-five minutes, the unloading ten minutes. On top of this the aircraft required a proper airfield on which to land. However, the T9 was of the correct shape, weight and size to be carried inside a Hamilcar glider, suggesting that these dimensions had been chosen deliberately so that the tank could be transported inside a glider if required.|$|R
40|$|A {{singular}} (or Hermann) foliation on {{a smooth}} manifold M {{can be seen}} as a subsheaf of the sheaf X of vector fields on M. We show that if this singular foliation admits a resolution (in the sense of sheaves) consisting of sections of a graded vector bundle of finite type, then one can <b>lift</b> the Lie <b>bracket</b> of vector fields to a Lie ∞-algebroid structure on this resolution, that we call a universal Lie ∞-algebroid associated to the foliation. The name is justified because it is isomorphic (up to homotopy) to any other Lie ∞-algebroid structure built on any other resolution of the given singular foliation.
