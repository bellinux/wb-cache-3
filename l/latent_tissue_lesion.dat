40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this}} {{retrospective}} analysis {{was to determine the}} age, gender, frequency and distribution of trauma-associated hard tissue and soft <b>tissue</b> <b>lesions</b> of the oral and maxillofacial region in a population from southern Taiwan. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Approximately 10 % of the 27, 995 biopsy records of patients with history of trauma resulting in lesions who were treated at our institution between 1991 and 2006 were examined for this study. RESULTS: In the included records, there were 2, 762 soft tissue and 26 hard <b>tissue</b> <b>lesions.</b> Mucocele was the most frequent trauma-associated soft <b>tissue</b> <b>lesion</b> (955 cases). The youngest patients were those who presented with mucocele (mean age = 27. 3 years), while the oldest patients were those with peripheral giant cell granuloma (58 years). The lower lip was the most frequent site of occurrence of mucocele (676, 64. 5 %) and was also the predominant site of occurrence of all soft <b>tissue</b> <b>lesions</b> (815, 29. 5 %), followed by the buccal mucosa (654, 23. 4 %) and the tongue (392, 14. 2 %). Trauma-associated hard <b>tissue</b> <b>lesions</b> included only osteoradionecrosis (24 cases) and traumatic bone cysts (2 cases).

DesignProspective single centre cohort study. Material and methodsConsecutive patients with CLI and tissue loss (Fontaine IV) (148 patients, 150 limbs) were followed prospectively for 1 year after infrainguinal bypass. Healing time of <b>tissue</b> <b>lesions,</b> graft patency, limb salvage, survival {{rates and the}} overall need for any type of surgical and endovascular procedure were analysed. Patient comorbidities were assessed by uni- and multivariate analysis to determine risk factors for adverse outcome. ResultsComplete tissue healing, including healing of ischaemic <b>tissue</b> <b>lesions</b> and surgical wounds, at 6 and 12 months after the infrainguinal bypass were respectively 40 % and 75 %. The median time to complete tissue healing was 190 days. Diabetes was the only significant risk factor which delayed tissue healing. Overall patency, limb salvage, survival and amputation-free survival rates were respectively at 12 months 80 %, 81 %, 73 % and 63 %. The clinically important endpoint amputation-free survival with completely healed wounds was attained in 50 % of patients at 1 year.

The present study determined the optimal syringes for high-pressure injection of dense connective <b>tissue</b> <b>lesions.</b> Methods: Different sizes (1, 3, 5, 10, 20, and 60 mL) of a mechanical syringe (reciprocating procedure device) with a luerlock fitting were studied. Twenty operators generated maximum pressure with each mechanical syringe size, and pressure was measured in pounds per square inch (psi). Subsequently, 223 dense connective <b>tissue</b> <b>lesions</b> were injected with different sizes of syringes (1, 3, or 10 mL). Outcomes included (i) successful intralesional injection and (ii) clinical response at 2 weeks. Results: Smaller syringes generated significantly more injection pressure than did larger syringes: 1 mL (363 197 psi), 3 mL (177 96 psi), 5 mL (73 40 psi), 10 mL (53 29 psi), 20 mL (32 18 psi), and 60 mL (19 12 psi). Similarly, smaller syringes were superior to larger syringes for intralesional injection success: 10 mL: 34 % (15 / 44) vs. 1 mL: 100 % (70 / 70) (p < 0. 001) and 3 mL: 91 % (99 / 109) (p < 0. 001).

40|$|The {{relationship}} between various immune functions, tissue damage, and splenomegaly was investigated {{during the course}} of Graft-versus-host (GVH) reactions. The GVH-associated <b>tissue</b> <b>lesions</b> appeared at the time when both the T- and B-cell functions were severely suppressed and NK cell activity was at its peak and/or highly augmented. The development of <b>tissue</b> <b>lesions</b> correlated with donor NK cell activity. On the other hand, splenomegaly developed independently of both the NK cell activity as well as <b>tissue</b> <b>lesions.</b> Prolonged immunosuppression was associated with thymic dysplasia, but not splenomegaly. The immune functions recovered gradually, following severe suppression, and coincided with the gradual recovery of the thymus. The immune functional recovery was observed in the following order: LPS responsive B-cell functions; ConA responsive T-cell functions; PHA responsive T-cell functions; and finally T-cell dependent B-cell responses. T-cell functions of immunodeficient GVH mice could be restored only when the thymic medullary regeneration had occurred. In contrast, the restoration of NK cell activity of NK-depressed mice was independent of thymic dysplasia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS. Two urological Centers were asked between 2002 and 2005 to use Coherent Versa Pulse 20 Ho-YAG laser source in the treatment of urinary stones in 212 patients, and urinary soft <b>tissue</b> <b>lesions</b> (urethra, ureter or bladder neck strictures or urinary tract tumors) in 56 patients. According to the various situations (either stone fragmentation or treatment of soft <b>tissue</b> <b>lesions),</b> pulse frequency and energy per impulse were differently dosed and set. RESULTS. The following parameters were identified as the starting points for the correct use of the Ho-YAG laser: a) lithotripsy with rigid endoscope: 365 μm fiber, 0. 8 - 1. 2 Joule (J) energy and 6 - 8 Hz frequency; 365 μm fiber, 0. 8 - 1. 2 J energy and 10 - 12 Hz frequency; 550 μm fiber, 1. 0 - 1. 5 J energy and 10 - 12 Hz frequency. b) lithotripsy with flexible endoscope: 270 μm fiber, 0. 6 - 1. 0 J energy and 6 - 10 Hz frequency. c) soft tissue resection in case of: c 1) ureteral stricture, 365 μm fiber, 0. 6 J energy and 14 - 16 Hz frequency; c 2) urethral stricture, 365 μm fiber, 0. 7 J energy and 16 - 18 Hz frequency; c 3) upper urinary tract tumors, 365 μm fiber, 0. 7 J energy and 16 Hz frequency; c 4) bladder tumors 365 μm fiber, 0. 8 J energy and 16 - 20 Hz frequency; c 5) bladder neck strictures, 365 μm fiber, 1. 0 J energy and 16 - 18 Hz frequency.

Microbiological water analyses revealed contamination by total coliforms, Escherichia coli and heterotrophic bacteria. In the gills, we observed a diversity of Gram-positive and Gramnegative bacteria. The <b>tissue</b> <b>lesions</b> were: lamellar fusion, interlamellar hyperplasia, sub-epithelial edema and telangiectasia. Inflammatory lesions were not observed.

40|$|Cerebral {{atherosclerosis}} (AS), {{small vessel}} disease (SVD), and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) {{are the most}} prevalent arterial disorders in the aged brain. Pathogenetically, AS and SVD share similar mechanisms: plasma protein leakage into the vessel wall, accumulation of lipid-containing macrophages, and fibrosis of the vessel wall. CAA, on the other hand, {{is characterized by the}} deposition of the amyloid β-protein in the vessel wall. Despite these differences between CAA, AS and SVD, apolipoprotein E (apoE) is involved in all three disorders. Such a pathogenetic link may explain the correlations between AS, SVD, CAA, and Alzheimer’s disease in the brains of elderly individuals reported in the literature. In addition, AS, SVD, and CAA can lead to <b>tissue</b> <b>lesions</b> such as hemorrhage and infarction. Moreover, intracerebral SVD leads to plasma protein leakage into the damaged vessel wall and into the perivascular space resulting in a blood–brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction.

In this review, we demonstrate the relationship between AS, SVD, and CAA as well as their contribution to the development of vascular <b>tissue</b> <b>lesions</b> and we emphasize an important role for apoE in the pathogenesis of vessel disorders and vascular <b>tissue</b> <b>lesions</b> as well as for BBB dysfunction on WML and lacunar infarct development...|$|R
