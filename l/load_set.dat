These models consist of FE beam elements and concentrated. For the preliminary sizing, the dynamic internal loads obtained from the dynamic simulations are converted to static <b>load</b> <b>sets</b> that are applied to a detailed 3 D FE representation of the aircraft. The combination of using the simple stick model as well as the conversion of the dynamic internal loads to static <b>load</b> <b>sets</b> leads to rather conservative designs. In this paper, an improved preliminary sizing process for dynamic load cases is presented. Two enhanced design processes are described, utilized and finally compared to the current design process. The used case for this study is built up by a generic aircraft which is subjected to different landing load cases. The first improvement of the design process removes the usage of static <b>load</b> <b>sets</b> for the preliminary sizing, while still allowing to utilize a simple stick model for the dynamic simulations. The second improvement also removes the stick model in the dynamic simulations and replaces it with a detailed 3 D representation of the aircraft.

To investigate {{the impact of}} Gag function on disease progression, the replication capacities of viruses encoding Gag-protease from 60 individuals in early HIV- 1 subtype C infection were assayed in an HIV- 1 -inducible green fluorescent protein reporter cell line and were correlated with subsequent disease progression. Replication capacities did not correlate with viral <b>load</b> <b>set</b> points (P = 0. 37) but were significantly lower in individuals with below-median viral <b>load</b> <b>set</b> points (P = 0. 03), {{and there was a}} trend of correlation between lower replication capacities and lower rates of CD 4 decline (P = 0. 09). Overall, the proportion of host HLA-specific Gag polymorphisms in or adjacent to epitopes was negatively associated with replication capacities (P = 0. 04), but host HLA-B-specific polymorphisms were associated with higher viral <b>load</b> <b>set</b> points (P = 0. 01).

We compared CD 4 lymphocyte cell count levels at seroconversion, decline rates and viral <b>load</b> <b>set</b> point in individuals infected with different HIV- 1 subtypes. METHODS We used {{data from the}} Concerted Action on SeroConversion to AIDS and Death in Europe (CASCADE) collaboration, restricted to those infected since 1996, aged ≥ 15 years, and applied mixed effects models for CD 4 cell count decline and median regression for viral <b>load</b> <b>set</b> point (mean level 6 - 24 months from seroconversion). RESULTS The analysis included 3364 seroconverters with known HIV- 1 subtypes. Compared with subtype B, CD 4 at seroconversion was significantly higher for subtype CRF 01 and lower for subtype C. Subsequent CD 4 decline was significantly slower for subtypes A and CRF 02 and marginally slower for subtype C compared with B. Mean CD 4 loss at 2 years of seroconversion for white men exposed through sex between men, aged 30 - 39 years, having seroconverted since 2006, enrolled within 6 months of seroconversion, and without acute infection was 88, 142, 100, 130, 103, and 167 cells/µL for subtypes A, B, C, CRF 01 _AE, CRF 02 _AG, and G, respectively.

40|$|Background. The biggest {{challenge}} in {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) prevention in Africa is the high HIV- 1 burden in young women. In macaques, proinflammatory cytokine production in the genital tract is necessary for target cell recruitment and establishment of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection following vaginal inoculation. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess if genital inflammation during early HIV- 1 infection predisposes women to rapid disease progression. Methods. Inflammatory cytokine concentrations were measured in cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) from 49 women 6, 17, 30, and 55 weeks after HIV- 1 infection and from 22 of these women before infection. Associations between genital inflammation and viral <b>load</b> <b>set</b> point and blood CD 4 cell counts 12 months after infection were investigated. Results. Elevated genital cytokine concentrations 6 and 17 weeks after HIV- 1 infection were associated with higher viral <b>load</b> <b>set</b> points and, to a lesser extent, with CD 4 depletion. CVL cytokine concentrations during early infection did not differ relative to preinfection but were elevated in women who had vaginal discharge, detectable HIV- 1 RNA in their genital tracts, and lower blood CD 4 counts. Conclusion. Genital inflammation during early HIV- 1 infection was associated with higher viral <b>load</b> <b>set</b> point and CD 4 depletion, which are markers of rapid disease progression.

This research work involved the prediction of the fatigue life of an automotive rear suspension twistbeam assembly fitted to a vehicle travelling over a customer correlated durability route. This was achieved by making use of the integrated concepts of scaling and superposition of linear static finite element analysis being driven by experimental load data - the so called 'quasi-static time domain' approach. A study of the free body diagram of the twistbeam resulted in an indeterminate <b>load</b> <b>set</b> of some 24 components, with experimental data indicating that a state of static unbalance existed. Subsequent to developing a matrix-based generalised method ofload cell calibration to confum the foregoing, a modal technique was developed to partition the experimental data into a static <b>load</b> <b>set,</b> causing elastic deformations, and a rigid <b>load</b> <b>set,</b> imparting rigid body accelerations. The semi-independent characteristics of the twistbeam necessitated the coupling of large structural displacements with inertia relief. This required extensive modifications to the current techniques {{and led to the}} development and use of a three dimensional functional response matrix in place of the conventional two dimensional one. Recommendations concerning appropriate finite element boundary conditions were also formulated to handle these effects. Finally, the limitations of the uniaxial fatigue model were revealed under the application of a set of tools for analysing the biaxiality and mobility of the maximum absolute principal stress...|$|E
