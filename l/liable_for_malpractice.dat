50|$|Problems {{can arise}} in {{supervision}} and training. First, supervisors are <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> <b>malpractice.</b> Also, questions have arisen {{as far as}} a supervisor's need for formal training to be a competent supervisor. Recent research suggests that conflicting, multiple relationships can occur between supervisors and clients, such as that of the client, instructor, and clinical supervisor. The occurrence of racial micro-aggression against Black clients suggests potential problems with racial bias in supervision. In general, conflicts between a counselor and his or her own supervisor can arise when supervisors demonstrate disrespect, lack of support, and blaming.|$|E
5000|$|The Vandals {{planned a}} benefit show {{to raise money}} to cover their legal fees, and {{considered}} legal action against Variety to lift the injunction against use of the original logo: [...] "After reading the public filing against us by the Daily Variety it is clear they are abusing this injunction to shake us down for money, and by filing against us when there are no prohibited images on any sites under our control, they have breached the settlement agreement between us. We did not agree to be responsible for third party distributors of this product. That was clear in the settlement agreement." [...] The band promised two tickets to the benefit to anyone who was able to notify them of a usage of the Variety-mocking logo on a site under the band's control. In April 2011 The Vandals successfully petitioned to have the case moved from Delaware to California. The band used their website to taunt Variety lawyer Henry Horbaczewski and editor Peter Bart, saying [...] "The Plaintiffs should all be ashamed and it is the Vandals' opinion that lawyers are <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> <b>malpractice</b> damages by ruining their client's reputation in a frivolous attempt to act like Godzilla when it comes to hoarding their precious font and inhibiting protected free speech." [...] Variety agreed to drop the case in February 2012. Bassist Joe Escalante, who has a background as an entertainment lawyer and represented The Vandals in the lawsuit, called it [...] "the worst thing that's ever happened to me, and to the band, and the hardest thing I've ever done.

40|$|Standard of Care {{applies to}} all conduct of all persons in all realms of activity. It is {{concerned}} with the acceptable activity of a practitioner in providing care for a patient. Failure to adhere to a minimum standard renders the practitioner <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> <b>malpractice</b> and negligence. Standards are affected by two factors, those within the profession via scientific research and development, and those external to it, namely government, administrative organizations, the courts and the doctor-patient “contract”. Each of these factors directly impact upon the delivery and/or alterations in the Standards of Care. It is imperative that the doctor realize that a failure to adhere to the Standard may result in action being taken by the above groups. Further, doctors must be aware that Standards are a volatile concept, changing as rapidly as the daily judgements eminating from the courtrooms, as new discoveries are introduced and as recognized by specialized groups. Maintaining current Standards ensure excellence in both professional practices and patient care...|$|E
40|$|The Rule Against Perpetuities {{offers an}} {{opportunity}} for those who teach property or trusts and estates to review {{some of the major}} schools of jurisprudence and how accurately or inaccurately those schools characterize law and legal development. At first blush, the idea that the rule can be used to advance a student 2 ̆ 7 s mastery or consideration of theory seems absurd. But this essay will outline an innovative approach to the rule that allows those who teach it to mix theory in with the difficult problems that the rule creates. The modern pedagogical approach to the rule treats it as an embarrassment [...] the difficult family problem that is not discussed in public. Teachers see it as bad medicine that must be dispensed and swallowed quickly, and different teachers vary on how much of the rule 2 ̆ 7 s technicalities they think the student should master (or at least endure). Students share the bad medicine view of the rule. Ask students what subject within property they hated most, and most will answer that it was the Rule Against Perpetuities. Indeed, it might rank as the most-hated doctrine studied {{in the first year of}} law school (although the Erie doctrine might give it a run for its money). Arcane in origin, difficult to understand and apply, unintuitive, and seemingly random in its effect, the rule brings together many of the difficulties that students have in adjusting to the rigors of legal study. Students joke about it, have nightmares about it, and learn through rumor that the rule is so complicated that, when they are in practice, they will not be held <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> <b>malpractice</b> if they draft an instrument that is subsequently held void because of the rule. Graduating third-year students frequently say-in all seriousness-that they will gladly spot the bar examiners any perpetuities problems and try to gain credit elsewhere on the exam rather than try to relearn the rule. In sum, students cannot understand why they have to endure the rule except as some kind of horrible historical accident of which they are the most recent victims. They certainly cannot explain what the rule means or does not mean from a jurisprudential standpoint-if ever they consider or are invited by their teachers to contemplate jurisprudence. Of course, some might question the propriety of introducing jurisprudence into the first year. Some people believe that the first year should consist primarily of building-block courses, i. e., courses that introduce students to basic legal rules that will appear in private practice and on the bar exam. Others believe that the first year should introduce students to legal skills or to legal reasoning and schools of jurisprudence more generally, giving the students a broader view of law as a whole before they leap into a specific advanced area. These approaches are not mutually exclusive, and teachers often use basic courses in the first year as an introduction to a school or several schools of jurisprudence along with an introduction to doctrine and skills. The typical courses offered in the first year lend themselves to this approach, and Property is no exception. For example, nuisance provides good material to introduce students to the Coase theorem and law and economics; marital property law provides good material to introduce feminist jurisprudence; zoning provides good material to illustrate concepts in public choice theory. Textbooks for Property offer the teacher tools for taking this approach to introducing jurisprudence. The Dukeminier and Krier text has an excerpt of Harold Demsetz 2 ̆ 7 s economic account of the development of private property (along with critiques of it); Joseph Singer 2 ̆ 7 s text offers a good overview of the law-and-economics approach to nuisance law, as well as a critique of that approach; and the Cribbet text begins with two chapters devoted to different views of what constitutes property and what are the attributes of property. Once the text hits the Rule Against Perpetuities, however, theory apparently stops, and I suspect that theory stops in classroom instruction as well. Property texts attempt to streamline presentation of the rule more through problems than through cases. Most property teachers gear their teaching of the rule to its basic mechanics, simply to get their students through the material, prepare them for the questions that they might face on the bar exam, and thus help them avoid embarrassment. Because of its complexity, the rule has generated its own set of specialized secondary study materials simply to explain how the rule works. Students can use CALI exercises or buy supplemental texts, workbooks, flashcards, outlines, or sample problems, to help them through these rough waters, all in an effort to avoid embarrassment on the final exam or on the bar exam. Property teachers whose primary field is not property or trusts and estates might also hew closely to the text and prepared problems to avoid being embarrassed themselves because they do not know the answer to a variation on one of the problems. There is, however, another deeper embarrassment that the rule creates: no major school of jurisprudence can comprehensively explain the origins of the rule, why such a complicated rule continues to persist, why the rule does not appear in jurisdictions other than those with an English common law heritage but why it does not appear in all of those, and why it has not been abolished or reformed until recently, and why reform or abandonment has occurred where it has occurred and when it has occurred. Each school of jurisprudence may be able to answer one or more of the preceding questions, but none provides a comprehensive explanation for the existence and persistence of this complicated conundrum. The rule thus provides property teachers an opportunity to invite their students to take a step back from staring into the abyss of perpetuities problems and consider different theoretical attempts to define why the law looks the way it does and whether different schools of theory accurately capture the entire picture. The Rule Against Perpetuities might embarrass not just law professors and law students; it might also embarrass schools of legal thought. In this essay I start by briefly describing the history of the rule, the standard problems that students confront, and some of the places where the rule is found geographically. The conclusions of this discussion are that the rule is fairly incoherent from a policy perspective and that it has not been widely adopted except in portions of the British Commonwealth and the United States. I then identify a few modern schools of jurisprudence [...] specifically law and economics, public choice theory, critical legal/race/feminist studies, the theory of legal transplants, and comparative institutional analysis [...] and show how each fails to explain the rule comprehensively...|$|E

40|$|Lawyers usually {{practice}} in law partnerships, and regularly, and with increasing frequency, join and depart these law firms. Commentators {{have only recently}} begun to examine the law governing the departure of partners from law firms. The purpose of this Comment is to examine one small aspect of the law governing this mobility: the post-departure liability of departed lawyers <b>for</b> <b>malpractice</b> committed by the remaining, servicing (to the client), ex-partners. The discussion will demonstrate how a too rigorous application of partnership law to the law firm situation leads to bad law. The Comment suggests that the client-law firm retainer agreement, which of course commits the firm to provide each of its clients appropriate legal services, also presumptively authorizes the law firm to manage its personnel for all its clients 2 ̆ 7 best interests. The Comment further suggests that any understanding among the departed lawyer and her ex-colleagues {{with respect to the}} firm and all its clients 2 ̆ 7 best interests should normally result in the departed lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s discharge from liability for her ex-colleagues 2 ̆ 7 post-departure malpractice.

40|$|In an {{increasing}} professional sports world, the referees in key tournaments and games have huge responsibility. Their decisions can impact {{not only on}} the game but on all the commercial interests involved in that game. This raises the issue of the liability of referees according to tort law. The main problems of liability of referees are the circumstances they work in. They have often only a split-second to make important decisions {{in the course of a}} game. The responsibility of a referee is so high that they can determine if a team wins or loses. These decisions can impact on the outcome of a game and consequently affect the financial situation of the clubs, sponsors and sportspeople. If a team is eliminated from a tournament they lose a huge amount of money. There are two legal aspects to consider. One is intention, where a referee might get involved in deliberate match-fixing, and another is negligence. Are match officials <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> their <b>malpractice?</b> Often a referee is not <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> lost chances because there is no causality that the team lost the game only because of a wrong referee decisions. For want of evidence the referee is in most cases not liable. However, is this right? The main thesis of this paper is that there is a liability of referees who act with intention. Referees who influence results negligently should be covered by immunity. However, sports governing body as guardians of the rules of the game should have some liability. They have a usual duty to ensure that a referee is able to manage the game and have it under control. Sports governing bodies may have vicarious liability for referee decisions as they use referees to fulfil their obligations of organising and running tournaments. The business approach of modern professional sport has added to the duties of sports governing bodies. Hence sports governing bodies have an added responsibility to ensure that all resources to support the referee and the rules - such as technical or assistant support - are utilized. These special duties need to be followed and can make sports governing bodies liable...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the author}} explores the {{relationship}} between the medical indications for surgery and the patient's right to self-determination, i. e. the right of a competent adult to make an informed decision about his/her medical treatment. In that context, the author points out to three practical questions. First, does the patient's right to self-determination imply the patient's participation in determining the medical indications for medical treatment, or is it only limited to the patient's authority to consent or not consent to the doctor's proposal? Second, can the patient's consent or insistence justify a surgery which is not medically indicated? Third, does the patient's right to self-determination imply that the patient assumes the risk associated with a surgery which is not medically indicated, thus excluding the doctor's professional responsibility (liability) ? Relying on the legal theory, legislative framework and judicial practice (case law), the author concludes that a surgery which is not medically indicated should be qualified as a wrongful act. The unlawful nature of this act cannot be excluded even by the patient's persistent demands to perform the surgery. The patient's right to self-determination implies only the possibility of accepting or refusing the medical treatment proposed by the doctor. The decision on the medical indication of a surgical procedure must be fully vested with the doctor, who is bound by the rules of medical science and medical ethics. In other words, a doctor should act in compliance with what he/she considers to be proper. Otherwise, the doctor may be held <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> medical <b>malpractice.</b> In principle, the doctor's liability for performing a surgery which is not medically indicated cannot be precluded by contracting a relevant doctor-patient agreement. The exception to this rule should be allowed only in cases when the patient is a medical expert who strongly believes that the medical intervention is medically indicated, in spite of the doctor's divergent opinion...|$|R
