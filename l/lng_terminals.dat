500|$|Milford Haven ( [...] ; , meaning [...] "mouth {{of the two}} Rivers Cleddau") is a {{town and}} {{community}} in Pembrokeshire, Wales. It is situated {{on the north side}} of the Milford Haven Waterway, an estuary forming a natural harbour that has been used as a port since the Middle Ages. The town was founded in 1790 {{on the north side of}} the Waterway, from which it takes its name. Designed to a grid pattern, it was originally intended by the founder, Sir William Hamilton, to be a whaling centre, though by 1800 it was developing as a Royal Navy dockyard which it remained until the dockyard was transferred to Pembroke in 1814. It then became a commercial dock, with the focus moving in the 1960s, after the construction of an oil refinery built by the Esso Company, to logistics for fuel oil and liquid gas. By 2010 the town's port has become the fourth largest in the United Kingdom in terms of tonnage, and plays an important role in the United Kingdom's energy sector with several oil refineries and one of the biggest <b>LNG</b> <b>terminals</b> in the world.|$|E

2500|$|Currently, the {{development}} of gas-fired thermoelectric power is somewhat jeopardized {{by the lack of}} secure gas supplies. In fact, having a secure gas contract is a prerequisite to build a new thermoelectric plant and to participate in a new energy auction (See [...] below). In order to counter the risk of unavailability of gas supplies, Brazil is in the initial stages of planning to build two <b>LNG</b> <b>terminals</b> that would likely come on-stream around 2010. However, in the meantime, several thermoelectric plants are converting their machinery to dual-fuel capacity (oil and gas).|$|E
