25|$|American writers {{expressed}} disillusionment following WW I. The {{stories and}} novels of F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896–1940) capture {{the mood of}} the 1920s, and John Dos Passos wrote about the war. Ernest Hemingway (1899–1961) became notable for The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms; in 1954, he won the Nobel Prize in Literature. William Faulkner (1897–1962) is notable for novels <b>like</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sound</b> and the Fury. American drama attained international status only in the 1920s and 1930s, with the works of Eugene O'Neill, who won four Pulitzer Prizes and the Nobel Prize. In the middle of the 20th century, American drama was dominated by the work of playwrights Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller, {{as well as by the}} maturation of the American musical.|$|E
25|$|He {{formed a}} three-man group with his cousins, Robert Diggs and Russell Jones, {{who would later}} be known as RZA and Ol' Dirty Bastard. At the time he didn't <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of his voice. The group, FOI: Force of the Imperial Master, and later All in Together, saw the three rapping and DJing, {{switching}} names and performing local shows; since they lived in different boroughs, GZA and Ol' Dirty would travel from Brooklyn out to Staten Island {{to meet up with}} their cousin RZA, after which the three would travel across New York City and challenge other MCs to battles. He left school in the 10th grade, but nurtured his affection for science as he developed his skills as a lyricist.|$|E
25|$|Diver Down {{performed}} better. The band then {{earned a}} spot in the Guinness Book of World Records for the highest-paid single appearance of a band: $1.5million for a 90-minute set at the 1983 US Festival. Despite this return to form, Roth and Eddie's differences continued, and this caused friction with other band members. Billy Sheehan, after his band Talas completed a tour with Van Halen, claims he was approached by Eddie Van Halen to replace Michael Anthony. The reasons for this were never clear to Sheehan because nothing came of it. During this time, Eddie and Alex Van Halen contributed the score and instrumental songs to the movie The Wild Life, starring Eric Stoltz. The score was heavy on the keyboards, similar to the sound used on the previous two albums and much more <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> coming in their next album.|$|E

25|$|In 2003 TCB, a band {{based in}} the Washington area, created a spinoff sound from go-go called bounce beat. Bounce beat is a heavier version of its {{ancestor}} that relies on timbales, drums, keyboards and bass to form its signature sound. At a time when bands like Backyard, UnCalled 4, and Raw Image were moving the genre toward a more driving sound by using a more forceful “breakdown” beat, bounce beat seems, in retrospect, like a natural progression. Still, the music was initially dismissed by all but a core of believers. It took fans time to realize TCB’s innovation wasn’t a rejection of “traditional” go-go, but a shift. Instead of paying homage to the genre’s early greats by copying their style, bounce beat built on a strong foundation and showed that the music still had more ideas to explore, limited only by percussive innovation and imagination. Fans of bounce beat, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> itself, tend to be much younger than the traditional go-go crowd. The rototom-dependent subgenre was initially maligned—some called it “noise,” others argued that it wasn’t go-go at all. Criticism of bounce beat was similar to what was said about the trap rap bubbling in other cities around the same time: It was blasted for its sometimes suggestive lyrics, its thwacking beat, its tempos that vacillated between syrupy and frenetic. But over time, bounce beat made inroads.|$|E
500|$|Fox was {{discovered}} by producer Ronald Shedlo and made his American television debut in the television film Letters from Frank, credited under the name [...] "Michael Fox". He intended to continue to use the name, but when he registered with the Screen Actors Guild, which requires unique registration names to avoid credit ambiguities, he discovered that Michael Fox, a veteran character actor, was already registered under the name. As he explained in his autobiography, Lucky Man: A Memoir and in interviews, he needed {{to come up with}} a different name. He did not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of [...] "Michael A. Fox" [...] during a time when [...] "fox" [...] was coming to mean [...] "attractive" [...] and because his middle initial sounded too much like the Canadian [...] "eh?" [...] He also didn't <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of [...] "Andrew" [...] or [...] "Andy," [...] so he decided to adopt a new middle initial and settled on [...] "J", as a homage to actor Michael J. Pollard.|$|E
500|$|One day, {{during the}} album sessions, the Edge {{was looking to}} record a guitar part, but due to a {{miscommunication}} with the road crew, most of his equipment was removed from his house and put into storage. The only gear remaining was a Roland Chorus guitar amplifier and a Bond Electraglide guitar in a closet that {{had been given to}} the Edge as a promotional item; Lanois said the guitar [...] "was considered to be just a piece of junk". After the Edge and the producer began playing with the instrument, they were impressed by its sound and subsequently added it to [...] "Exit". Lanois said, [...] "it's a very, very dirty guitar sound <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of a machine that's alive, grunting and grinding." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2012, {{he changed}} the {{spelling}} of his name from [...] "Irfan" [...] to [...] "Irrfan" [...] and has said he <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of <b>the</b> extra [...] "r" [...] in his name.|$|R

6000|$|... "That {{was merely}} because I didn't think it right," [...] said Archie, who, {{now that he}} had worked himself into <b>the</b> vein, <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of his own voice. [...] "It was indeed." ...|$|R
500|$|The song {{has been}} covered by {{artists such as}} Groove Holmes, the Troggs, Charlie McCoy, and Psychic TV. John Bush commented: [...] "'Good Vibrations' was rarely reprised by other acts, even during the cover-happy '60s. Its {{fragmented}} style made it essentially cover-proof." [...] In 1976, a nearly identical cover version was released as a single by Todd Rundgren for his album Faithful. When asked for his opinion, Brian said: [...] "Oh, he did a marvelous job, {{he did a great}} job. I was very proud of his version." [...] Rundgren's single peaked at number 34 on the Billboard Hot 100. Rundgren explained: [...] "I used to <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of the Beach Boys, but it wasn't until they began to compete with the Beatles that I felt that what they were doing was really interesting—like around Pet Sounds and 'Good Vibrations' ... when they started to shed that whole surf music kind of burden and start to branch out into something that was a little more universal. ... I tried to do [...] as literally as I could because in the intervening 10 years, radio had changed so much. Radio had become so formatted and so structured that that whole experience was already gone." ...|$|E
500|$|Pound {{broadcast}} over Rome Radio, although the Italian government {{was at first}} reluctant, concerned {{that he might be}} a double agent. He told a friend: [...] "It took me, I think it was, two years, insistence and wrangling etc., to get hold of their microphone." [...] He recorded over a hundred broadcasts criticizing the United States, Roosevelt, Roosevelt's family and the Jews, and rambling about his poetry, economics and Chinese philosophy. The first was in January 1935, and by February 1940 he was broadcasting regularly; he traveled to Rome one week a month to pre-record the 10-minute broadcasts, for which he was paid around $17, and they were broadcast every three days. The broadcasts required the Italian government's approval, although he often changed the text in the studio. Tytell wrote that Pound's voice had assumed a [...] "rasping, buzzing quality <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of a hornet stuck in a jar", that throughout the [...] "disordered rhetoric of the talks he sustained the notes of chaos, hysteria, and exacerbated outrage." [...] The politics apart, Pound needed the money; his father's pension payments had stopped —his father died in February 1942 in Rapallo — and Pound had his mother and Dorothy to look after.|$|E
500|$|Live was {{released}} to keep Usher's fans satisfied during the four-year break between My Way (1997) and 8701, his {{second and third}} studio albums, respectively. During that time, Usher was busy pursuing an acting career in films The Faculty (1998), Light It Up (1999) and Texas Rangers (2001). The album was recorded at two free concerts Usher performed {{in his hometown of}} Chattanooga, Tennessee on October15 and 16,1998. Usher stated his reasons for releasing a live album in an interview with MTV, [...] "I really <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of a band, that's one, just for myself, but there were so many people who didn't {{get a chance to see}} the concert, so I came out with a live version of most of the songs on my album, and I came out with a home video for all the people who didn't get a chance to see the performance, and a little bio of me as well." [...] Seven of the songs included on Live are from Usher's self-titled debut album (1994) and My Way. A medley of songs originally performed by Bobby Brown—"Don't Be Cruel", [...] "Every Little Step", [...] "Rock Wit'cha" [...] and [...] "Roni"—is also featured on the album, along with covers of Force MDs' [...] "Tender Love" [...] and LL Cool J's [...] "I Need Love".|$|E

[...] However, the magazine's name (and hence the band's) is [...] "Fashion News" [...] or [...] "Fashion Update" [...] (dépêche, [...] "dispatch," [...] from Old French despesche/despeche or [...] "news report," [...] and mode or [...] "fashion").|$|E
2500|$|Nicola Rossi-Lemeni relates that Callas's mentor Tullio Serafin used {{to refer}} to her as [...] "Una grande vociaccia"; he continues, [...] "Vociaccia is a little bit pejorative—it means an ugly voice—but grande means a big voice, a great voice. A great ugly voice, in a way." [...] Callas herself did not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of her own voice; in one of her last interviews, {{answering}} whether or not she was able to listen to her own voice, she replies, ...|$|E
50|$|Rattles {{provide a}} source of stimulation. Babies <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> they produce and follow {{the path of the}} rattle with their eyes, as well as giving them a sense of {{discovery}} as they try to grab and hold the rattle.|$|R

2500|$|In 2005, he {{was awarded}} the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States' most prestigious {{civilian}} award, by President George W. Bush.

Americans <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of his voice...over the decades we have come to recognize in that voice some of the finest qualities of our country: patriotism, the good humor, the kindness, and common sense of Americans." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{statement}} {{ended with}} these words: [...] "We {{are not doing}} this {{because we want to}} fight.

2500|$|When {{creating}} {{sound effects}} for films, sound recordists and editors do not generally concern {{themselves with the}} verisimilitude or accuracy of the sounds they present. [...] The sound of a bullet entering a person from a close distance may sound nothing <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> designed in the above example, but since very few people are aware of how such a thing actually sounds, the job of designing the effect is mainly an issue of creating a conjectural sound which feeds the audience's expectations while still suspending disbelief.|$|E
50|$|He <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> {{of bells}} (ghanta) and had {{bell-shaped}} ears (karna) {{so he was}} called Ghanta-karna Mahavir (great warrior). He was fond of sukhdi (mixture of jaggery, wheat and ghee), a sweet, so it is offered by devotees at his Mahudi shrine.|$|R

It could also just be like an ironic statement. I don't know, I just <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of it." [...] Rose also mentioned the album would feature [...] "lot of different sounds. There's some heavy songs, there's a lot of aggressive songs, but they're all in different styles and different sounds. It is truly a melting pot." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite royal {{patronage}} and encouragement, {{there was}} never any overt mandate to use the new translation. It was not until 1661 that the Authorized Version replaced the Bishops Bible in the Epistle and Gospel lessons of the Book of Common Prayer, and it never did replace the older translation in the Psalter. In 1763 The Critical Review complained that [...] "many false interpretations, ambiguous phrases, obsolete words and indelicate expressions...excite the derision of the scorner". Blayney's 1769 version, with its revised spelling and punctuation, helped change the public perception of the Authorized Version to a masterpiece of the English language. By the 19th century, F. W. Faber could say of the translation, [...] "It lives on the ear, like music that can never be forgotten, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of church bells, which the convert hardly knows how he can forego." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{development}} from trainspotting (almost {{unique to the}} UK) is the [...] "haulage basher" [...] or locomotive haulage enthusiast These individuals attempt to ride behind or in the cab (some people do not count the latter as proper [...] "haulage") of as many locomotives as they can, marking them off in a book as would a regular trainspotter. Even the shortest haulage will count, such as being hauled for {{a few hundred yards}} by a shunting locomotive when one portion of a train is being hooked up to another at a junction. In some cases fans who <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of a particular type of locomotive working hard hauling a train will ride behind them as much as possible, even following English-built locomotives exported abroad, Portugal's 1800 Class (similar to BR Class 50) being one example.
