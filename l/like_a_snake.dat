5|$|Seldom observed, the {{frilled shark}} may capture prey by bending its body and lunging forward <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>snake.</b> The long, {{extremely}} flexible jaws {{enable it to}} swallow prey whole, while its many rows of small, needle-like teeth {{make it difficult for}} the prey to escape. It feeds mainly on cephalopods, leavened by bony fishes and other sharks. This species is aplacental viviparous: the embryos emerge from their egg capsules inside the mother's uterus, where they survive primarily on yolk. The gestation period may be as long as three and a half years, the longest of any vertebrate. Litter sizes vary from two to fifteen, and there is no distinct breeding season. Frilled sharks are occasional bycatch in commercial fisheries, but have little economic value.|$|E
500|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, the barn owl does not hoot (such calls {{are made by}} typical owls, like the tawny owl or {{other members of the}} genus Strix). It instead {{produces}} the characteristic shree scream, ear-shattering at close range, an eerie, long-drawn-out shriek. Males in courtship give a shrill twitter. Both young and old can hiss <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>snake</b> to scare away intruders. Other sounds produced include a purring chirrup denoting pleasure, and a [...] "kee-yak", which resembles one of the vocalisations of the tawny owl. When captured or cornered, the barn owl throws itself on its back and flails with sharp-taloned feet, making for an effective defence. In such situations it may emit rasping sounds or clicking snaps, produced probably by the beak but possibly by the tongue.|$|E
500|$|Unlike most {{anthropomorphic}} cars, {{the eyes}} of the cars in this film were placed on the windshield (which resembles the Tonka Talking Trucks, and the characters from Tex Avery's One Cab's Family short and Disney's own Susie the Little Blue Coupe), rather than within the headlights. According to production designer Bob Pauley, [...] "From the very beginning of this project, John Lasseter had it in his mind to have the eyes be in the windshield. For one thing, it separates our characters from the more common approach where you have little cartoon eyes in the headlights. For another, he thought that having the eyes down near the mouth at {{the front end of the}} car feels more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>snake.</b> With the eyes set in the windshield, the point of view is more human-like, and made it feel like the whole car could be involved in the animation of the character. This decision was heavily criticized by automotive blog Jalopnik.|$|E

50|$|Slowworms can be {{distinguished}} from snakes by several features: their eyelids, which snakes lack entirely; their small ear openings, which again snakes lack; and their tongues, which are notched in the centre rather than completely forked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>snake's.</b>|$|R
500|$|Romeo Void has {{generally}} been classified as a new wave or post-punk band. Some critics have noted dance elements in the music. According to Stewart Mason, writing for Allmusic, [...] " [...] band's muscular blend of Joy Division's atmospherics and the Gang of Four's rattling momentum, with Benjamin Bossi's splattering free jazz saxophone coloring everything, made Romeo Void {{one of the strongest}} of the American post-punk bands. The St. Petersburg Times wrote that they [...] "had no trouble creating a signature sound for [...] scratchy guitar, soulful sax, [...] tight, precise drums." [...] The New York Times stated that they sounded like [...] "an art-school band, with its textural complexity [...] touches of jazz and funk" [...] Saxophone player Benjamin Bossi has been observed as the ingredient that [...] "set the band apart" [...] and showed a [...] "talent for both improvisation and arrangement." [...] Alan Niester, writing for The Globe and Mail, said that he weaved [...] "in and out [...] <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>snake</b> charmer" [...] and reminded him of Andy Mackay, a saxophonist that played with Roxy Music.|$|E

2500|$|Orangutans {{produce an}} alarm call {{known as a}} [...] "kiss squeak" [...] when they {{encounter}} a predator <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>snake</b> or a human. Sometimes, orangutans will strip leaves from a branch and hold {{them in front of}} their mouth when making the sound. It has been found this lowers the maximum frequency of the sound i.e. makes it deeper, and in addition, smaller orangutans are more likely to use the leaves. It has been suggested they use the leaves to make themselves sound bigger than they really are, the first documented case of an animal using a tool to manipulate sound.|$|E
60|$|But {{the fierce}} old hag {{began to get}} angry and show {{a glimpse of her}} diabolic nature (<b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>snake's</b> head, peeping with a hiss out of her bosom), at this pusillanimous {{behavior}} of the thing which she had taken the trouble to put together.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: One of {{the makeup}} designs {{in the film}} for Jennifer's mouth while the {{character}} is in demonic form. Fox explained that the jaw unhinges sort of <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>snake's</b> so that Jennifer can [...] "fully envelop" [...] her victims. Unlike <b>a</b> <b>snake,</b> the character has long, sharp teeth in order to tear the flesh from her victims' bodies as she eats them.|$|R
5000|$|This {{caterpillar}} absorbs toxins {{from the}} host plants, and therefore tastes poor to bird predators.
