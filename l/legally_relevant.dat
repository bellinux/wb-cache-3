2500|$|In {{order for}} an actus reus to be {{committed}} there has {{to have been an}} act. Various common law jurisdictions define act differently but generally, an act is a [...] "bodily movement whether voluntary or involuntary." [...] In Robinson v. California, , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a California law making it illegal to be a drug addict was unconstitutional because the mere status of being a drug addict was not an act and thus not criminal. Commentator Dennis Baker asserts: [...] "Although lawyers find the expression actus reus convenient, it is misleading in one respect. It means not just the criminal act but all the external elements of an offence. Ordinarily, there is a criminal act, which is what makes the term actus reus generally acceptable. But there are crimes without an act, and therefore without an actus reus in the obvious meaning of that term. The expression “conduct” is more satisfactory, because wider; it covers not only an act but an omission, and (by a stretch) a bodily position. The conduct must sometimes take place in <b>legally</b> <b>relevant</b> circumstances. The relevant circumstances might include consent in the case of rape. The act of human sexual intercourse becomes a wrongful act if it is committed in circumstances where one party does not consent and/or one or more parties concerned are below the age of consent. Other crimes require the act to produce a legally forbidden consequence. Such crimes are called result crimes. ... All that can truly be said, without exception, is that a crime requires some external state of affairs that can be categorized as criminal. What goes on inside a person’s head is never enough in itself to constitute a crime, even though it might be proved by a confession that is fully believed to be genuine." ...|$|E

As couples and advocates publically confront this issue, their voices promote legislation in support of same-sex immigration rights, as well as navigate the contentious topics of immigration, sexuality, citizenship and family. I examine news articles and documents from January 2000 through March 2012 to argue that themes of marriage, family and nation frame the plight of same-sex binational couples, providing a <b>legally</b> and culturally <b>relevant</b> context for their rights claims.

40|$|Current legal {{regulation}} {{of medical care}} for individuals approaching {{the end of life}} in the United States is predicated essentially on a factual model emanating from a series of high-profile judicial opinions concerning the rights of adults who become either permanently unconscious or are clearly going to die soon with or without aggressive attempts of curative therapy. The need for a flexible, adaptable approach to medically treating people approaching the end of their lives, and a similar openness to possible modification of the legal framework within which treatment choices are made and implemented, are particularly important when older individuals are involved. Of the approximately 2. 5 million people who die each year in the U. S., about three-quarters of deaths occur among persons aged sixty-five and older. As stated succinctly by historian Jill Lepore, “[t]he longer we live, the longer we die. ” This article outlines a few of the most salient clinical and social factors that distinguish the large and growing cohort of older persons, in potentially <b>legally</b> and policy <b>relevant</b> ways, from other population groups for whom end-of-life medical treatment choices may come into play.

40|$|Objectives: Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV), Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C viruses and Treponema pallidum are parenterally and {{sexually transmitted infection}} agents. Screening test is made before marriage to pre-marital couples <b>legally</b> under the <b>relevant</b> legislation and legal procedures in our country; applicants are evaluated in terms of sexually transmitted diseases. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate pre-marital test results for HBsAg, anti-HCV, anti-HIV I/II and Treponema pallidum. Materials and methods: To make screening test before marriage, randomized 117 patients who were applied to Kızıltepe General Hospital of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, were included in this study between January 2011 and March 2011. Of these patients, 64 were women (average age 24. 7 ± 5. 7), and 55 were males (mean age 24. 7 ± 4. 7). HBsAg, anti-HCV and anti-HIV I/II tests of the patients were studied by macro-ELISA device (ECIQ Vitros, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, USA), screening of anti-Treponema pallidum IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies were studied by immunochromatographic rapid test (syphilis syphilis 3. 0, Standard Diagnostics, inc. Korea). Results: Of the 119 patients, five patients (4. 2 %) were positive for HBsAg (3 male and 2 female). Anti-HCV, anti-HIV I/II and anti-Treponema pallidum antibodies were negative in all patients. Conclusion: HBsAg test result which was obtained in present study has been found consistent with HBsAg positivity rate in our region. As a result of screening test that was done before marriage will continue to believe that the increased importance of the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases.

Furthermore, the DRW as part of its research lists the <b>legally</b> <b>relevant</b> vocabulary, not only of Modern High German, but of all Western German language varieties. The dictionary cites usage of historical vocabulary from various regions of the West Germanic language area from England to Transylvania, from Lorraine to the Baltic Seas.
