Items could also be simply added to the Start menu by dragging and dropping them. The menu also offered the ability to shut down and <b>log</b> <b>off</b> from their computer.|$|E

2500|$|Downtown Jimmy of Extreme Gamer {{complained that}} the {{controls}} were too simple and criticized the camera for not having a lock on feature. While {{he felt that the}} graphics were not impressive, they still looked good enough to surpass his expectations of what the game looked like. Carolyn Petit of GameSpot found that the visuals captured the look of the anime very well. She stated that the controls were complex but featured little depth. She mentioned that attacks made the battle within the game feel [...] "tremendous", but stated the Ki building process would take attention away from the combat due to being time consuming and leaving the player wide open to an attack. She also had complaints over the multiplayer, claiming that as the screen became split down the middle on offline multiplayer, it would limit the player's view and that online multiplayer was better but would be riddled with opponents that would instantly <b>log</b> <b>off</b> if things don't go their way. Jeremy Jastrzab of PAL Gaming Network pointed out that the game was good by itself, but was not as good as any of the previous games, stating that [...] "there is no excuse for it being worse than its predecessors." ...|$|E
