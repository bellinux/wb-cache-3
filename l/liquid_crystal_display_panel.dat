40|$|We {{studied the}} changes in the {{transmission}} and contrast properties of a super-twisted nematic <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>display</b> <b>panel,</b> induced by the light impinging on the panel it-self. Upon illumination by laser radiation with power density close to that used in practice, the transmittance of the panel increases or decreases according to the brightness voltage that sets the transmittance level. The dynamics of the transmittance change are typically bi-exponential, with a shorter decay time of the order of the fraction of a second and a longer decay of the order of the tens of seconds. The observed changes were interpreted and modeled by considering local temperature changes in the crystal because of the light impinging onto it. The temperature changes produce a shift of the transmittance curve and a change of slope in its central region. The presence of the dip after the Frederickzs region accounts for the anomalous behavior of the transmittance in that portion of brightness voltages.

Popular mechanical cutting {{of the glass}} panel using small diamond wheel is not always high quality which brings lower productivity of the panel. Precise breaking of the panel with non-contact method using CO 2 laser, is recently conducted enthusiastically. The excellent results, however, have not been obtained. Present experiments focus on high quality breaking of the display panel of STN liquid crystal in which some lenses of different focus are used. Breaking tests are performed in air under an ambient temperature using different size of specimens including the notchted ones. It is found that effective spot size of laser {{on the surface of}} specimen increases with the usage of longer focus lens which is related closely to the breaking quality of the glass. The lens with shorter focal length elevates the breaking rate of the glass plate and also improves the breaking quality of it. The experiments show that the rate of breaking is independent upon the size of the plate, but it is dependent on the shape of notch made at edge of the specimen. The choice of optimum condition for the breaking yields less meandering main crack and non-branching cracks which deteriorate the breaking quality of the glass plate...|$|E
