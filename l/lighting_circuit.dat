50|$|Aluminium wire {{was common}} in North American {{residential}} wiring {{from the late}} 1960s to mid-1970s due to {{the rising cost of}} copper. Because of its greater resistivity, aluminium wiring requires larger conductors than copper.

5000|$|The {{switches}} may be {{single or}} multiple, designed for indoor or outdoor use. Optional extras may include dimmer-controls, environmental protection, weather and security protection. In residential and light commercial lighting systems, {{the light switch}} directly controls the circuit feeding the lamps. In larger lighting systems, for example warehouses or outdoor lighting systems, the required current may be too high for a manual switch. In these systems light switches control lighting contactors, a relay that allows the manual light switch to operate on a lower voltage or with smaller wiring than would be required in the main <b>lighting</b> <b>circuit.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some {{places where}} high fields may exist, with the {{potential}} for hazards to arise in a ground loop close by, are close to AC electrified railways with simple return through the rails, where the overhead wiring may be carrying several hundred amps at 50 or 60 Hz (the voltage is not important), or close to a power distribution network carrying high currents with widely spaced wires. Again, the voltage is not relevant. Inside a building, the wiring may include radiating loops, e.g. careless layout may result in the live feed to a <b>lighting</b> <b>circuit,</b> via the switch, take a different route than the neutral (return) conductor, creating a radiating loop, but this {{will not be able to}} couple sufficient energy to create a hazard.|$|E
50|$|The {{decision}} to gradually change Brisbane's street lighting {{to the series}} system was taken in 1927, and the BCC decided to switch Balmoral and Coorparoo's street lighting to the series system in May 1930. In a parallel circuit system, each item receives its own full voltage from the power supply, but in the series system the current flows through each item in turn, in a loop from the power source. A series street <b>lighting</b> <b>circuit</b> usually consisted of about 100 lamps, and required a minimum of 2000 volts. If more lamps were added, a higher voltage was required to maintain the necessary current. If a lamp burnt out, two metal disks would carry the current and maintain the circuit. Incandescent street lights had become economically practical by 1917, and Brisbane developed its street lighting system using incandescent lamps, in series. The only other towns to use the series system for street lighting, since they had AC generators, were Maryborough, Mackay, Townsville and Cairns. Other towns used incandescent lights on the parallel system.|$|E

Stotz's invention was the forerunner of the modern thermal-magnetic breaker commonly used in household load centers to this day.Interconnection of multiple generator sources into an electrical grid required development of circuit breakers with increasing voltage ratings and increased ability to safely interrupt the increasing short circuit currents produced by networks. Simple air-break manual switches produced hazardous arcs when interrupting high voltages; these gave way to oil-enclosed contacts, and various forms using directed flow of pressurized air, or of pressurized oil, to cool and interrupt the arc. By 1935, the specially constructed circuit breakers used at the Boulder Dam project use eight series breaks and pressurized oil flow to interrupt faults of up to 2,500 MVA, in three cycles of the AC power frequency.|$|E
50|$|In {{a similar}} fashion to that of Christmas tree lights, {{before the advent of}} high-intensity {{discharge}} lamps, street light circuits using incandescent light bulbs were often operated as high-voltage series circuits. Each individual street-lamp was equipped with a film cutout; a small disk of insulating film that separated two contacts connected to the two wires leading to the lamp. In the same fashion as with the Christmas lights described above, if the lamp failed, the entire voltage of the street <b>lighting</b> <b>circuit</b> (thousands of volts) was imposed across the insulating film in the cutout, causing it to rupture. In this way, the failed lamp was bypassed and illumination restored {{to the rest of the}} street. Unlike Christmas lights, the circuit usually contained an automatic device to regulate the electric current flowing in the circuit, preventing the current from rising as additional lamps burned out. When the failed lamp was finally changed, a new piece of film was also installed, once again separating the electrical contacts in the cutout. This style of street lighting was recognizable by the large porcelain insulator that separated the lamp and reflector from the light's mounting arm; the insulator was necessary because the two contacts in the lamp's base may have routinely operated at a potential of several thousands of volts above ground/earth.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Airfield <b>lighting</b> <b>circuit</b> is an {{important}} part of airfield lighting system, and the insulation resistance value of this circuit is affected by humidity, temperature, the quality and the number of the Isolation Transformers and many other factors, so it is difficult to accurately predict the resistance size by using traditional methods. In the light of insulation resistance values of airfield <b>lighting</b> <b>circuit,</b> this paper put forward adopting Gray System Theory to make the prediction, and then build GM(2, 1) model to analyze and forecast the resistance values according to the actually measured values of the insulation resistance at Shanghai Pudong International Airport. Finally, the research shows that there is only a little difference between predicted values and the actually measured values. In other words, the prediction of insulation resistance based on Gray System Theory is viable...|$|E
