5|$|In 1870, Stone and Blackwell {{moved from}} New Jersey to Dorchester, Massachusetts, which {{today is a}} {{neighborhood}} of Boston just south of downtown. There they purchased Pope's Hill, a seventeen-room house with extensive grounds and several outbuildings. Many of the town's women had {{been active in the}} Dorchester Female Anti-Slavery Society and, by 1870, a number of <b>local</b> <b>women</b> were suffragists.|$|E
5|$|In 1936 {{the lodge}} became a hotel, but was badly damaged by yet another fire in 1941.

5|$|Camp Morton's first Confederate prisoners {{arrived on}} February 22–23, 1862. Many of the 2,398 Confederates {{in the first}} group were sick, ill fed, and without {{sufficient}} clothing for the cold, northern winters. The citizens of Indianapolis rallied to provide humanitarian aid for the prisoners, which included additional food, clothing, and supplies. Local doctors aided the sick and <b>local</b> <b>women</b> provided nursing care. The Athenaeum, {{at the corner of}} East Michigan Street and Massachusetts Avenue, and another local building were converted into hospitals to treat the Confederate prisoners. For the remainder of the war, Camp Morton typically housed between 3,000 and 6,000 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|During the preparations, a mixed {{unit that}} {{included}} <b>local</b> <b>women</b> protected the left {{flank of the}} Greek Army, against a possible attack by Ottoman groups that were stationed in Paramythia. Moreover, groups consisting of local females supported the Greek side in several ways, particularly in the transportation of guns, food, clothes, and other important supplies. On specific occasions women also participated in the armed conflicts against the Ottoman forces, {{some of them were}} distinguished in the battlefield, like Maria Nastouli, who reached the rank of captain.|$|E
5|$|In the three-acre garden, when Jane and Kingsley lived there, {{there was}} an old barn that was itself a listed building, a conservatory, a gravel drive, three {{descending}} lawns, a rose garden, cedar trees, a mulberry tree (where Lucy Snowe, their cat, was buried), and a weathervane dating to 1775. At the end of the garden, through a five-bar gate, there lay a five-acre meadow that also belonged to the property and had been let out to two <b>local</b> <b>women</b> for their horses.|$|E

5|$|The first church {{building}} was erected in 1886 in Oconto, Wisconsin, by <b>local</b> <b>women</b> who believed Christian Science had helped them. For {{a down payment}} of $2,000 and a mortgage of $8,763, the church purchased land in Falmouth Street, Boston, for the erection of a building. Eddy asked Augusta Stetson, a prominent Scientist, to establish a church in New York. By the end of 1886 Christian Science teaching institutes had sprung up around the United States.|$|E
5|$|The new tolls {{cause the}} price of food and other {{essentials}} to rise, enriching both Süß and the Duke. Süß gains the authority to levy taxes on salt, beer, wine, and wheat as well. He also assists in procuring <b>local</b> <b>women</b> for the Duke, thus engaging in the corruption of their morals. The increase in {{the price of}} basic necessities causes the people of Württemberg to suffer great privation.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had left}} Canton, Simão de Andrade landed at Xiamen and Ningbo, {{establishing}} settlements there. Simão continued to defy local Chinese laws at Ningbo, and when his men were cheated on a trade deal with a Chinese man in 1545, Simão sent a band of armed men into the town, pillaged it, and took <b>local</b> <b>women</b> and young girls as their captives. The outraged locals banded together and slaughtered the Portuguese under Simão. A similar episode occurred later when Coelho de Sousa seized {{the house of a}} wealthy foreign resident in Jinzhou of Fujian, which led authorities to cut off supplies to the Portuguese; the Portuguese then attacked and ransacked a nearby village for supplies, which prompted Chinese authorities to destroy thirteen of their ships while thirty Portuguese survivors of this settlement fled to the Portuguese settlement at Macau in 1549.|$|E

5|$|Henry had a {{considerable}} sexual appetite and enjoyed {{a substantial number}} of sexual partners, resulting in a large number of illegitimate children, at least nine sons and 13 daughters, many of whom he appears to have recognised and supported. It was normal for unmarried Anglo-Norman noblemen to have sexual relations with prostitutes and <b>local</b> <b>women,</b> and kings were also expected to have mistresses. Some of these relationships occurred before Henry was married, but many others took place after his marriage to Matilda. Henry had a wide range of mistresses from a range of backgrounds, and the relationships appear to have been conducted relatively openly. He may have chosen some of his noble mistresses for political purposes, but the evidence to support this theory is limited.|$|E
5|$|After Béla's {{withdrawal}} from Halych, Roman Mstislavich {{returned with the}} assistance of Rurik Rostislavich, Prince of Belgorod Kievsky. They tried to expel Andrew and his Hungarian retinue, but the Hungarians routed the united forces of Mstislavich and Rostislavich. A group of local boyars offered the throne to Rostislav Ivanovich, a distant cousin of the imprisoned Vladimir Yaroslavich. Béla III sent reinforcements to Halych, enabling Andrew's troops to repel the attacks. Andrew's reign remained unpopular in Halych, because the Hungarian soldiers insulted <b>local</b> <b>women</b> and did not respect Orthodox churches. Consequently, the local boyars allied with their former prince, Vladimir Yaroslavich, who had escaped from captivity and returned to Halych. Duke Casimir II of Poland also supported Vladimir Yaroslavich, and they expelled Andrew and his retinue from the principality in August 1189 or 1190. Andrew returned to Hungary after his defeat. He did not receive a separate duchy from his father, who only gave him estates and money. On his deathbed, Béla III, who had pledged to lead a crusade to the Holy Land, ordered Andrew to fulfill his vow. Andrew's father died on 23 April 1196, and Andrew's older brother, Emeric, succeeded him.|$|E
5|$|Biko's banning {{order in}} 1973 {{prevented}} him from working officially for the BCPs from which he had previously earned a small stipend, but he helped {{to set up a}} new BPC branch in Ginsberg, which held its first meeting in the church of a sympathetic white clergyman, David Russell. Establishing a more permanent headquarters in Leopold Street, the branch served as a base from which to form new BCPs; these included self-help schemes such as classes in literacy, dressmaking and health education. For Biko, community development was {{part of the process of}} infusing black people with a sense of pride and dignity. Near King William's Town, a BCP Zanempilo Clinic was established to serve as a healthcare centre catering for rural black people who would not otherwise have access to hospital facilities. He helped to revive the Ginsberg crèche, a daycare for children of working mothers, and establish a Ginsberg education fund to raise bursaries for promising local students. He helped establish Njwaxa Home Industries, a leather goods company providing jobs for <b>local</b> <b>women.</b> In 1975, he co-founded the Zimele Trust, a fund for the families of political prisoners.|$|E

5|$|Several {{accounts}} about Murrell's {{activities have}} been preserved, {{either because they}} were reported on by the regional press or because they were passed down in oral tradition. One example focused around a rumour that had spread in nearby Canewdon which claimed that two prominent <b>local</b> <b>women</b> were malevolent witches. One of these individuals was Mary Ann Atkinson, {{the wife of the}} Reverend William Atkinson, the vicar of Canewdon. The other was Eliza Lodwick, a widow who took control of the 500 acre Lambourne Hall following the death of her husband in 1826; on two separate occasions labourers were convicted of stealing from her, while another died accidentally on her property. Locals concerned that these women were witches approached the vicar with their beliefs, but he dismissed them. They subsequently turned to Murrell, asking for his aid in exposing the women as witches. According to claims made in the 1950s by the-then 94-year-old local man Arthur Downes, the Canewdon villagers believed that Murrell could force all of the witches to assemble and dance about the churchyard against their will by whistling. However, the vicar intervened, with locals believing that he was doing so to protect his wife. The vicar himself died in March 1847.|$|E
5|$|The Sadducismus debellatus pamphlets, {{written by}} Lord Cullen, giving {{details about the}} demonic {{possession}} of Christian Shaw, the 11-year-old girl at {{the centre of the}} Paisley witches trials, were in circulation at the time. Patrick Cowper, the local minister who was intolerant of witches, had read the pamphlets to Morton just before his afflictions began. The villagers' suspicions were aroused that the Devil was implicated when no explanation could be given for Morton's condition; initially his seizures were described as unusual then as preternatural. Cowper continued to advise Morton about what happened in Paisley and encouraged him to name Laing as the person who had called upon the Devil to inflict his ailments. In May 1704 Morton named Laing as a witch and, with further prompting from Cowper, accused four <b>local</b> <b>women</b> of being her accomplices: Isobel Adam; Janet Cornfoot; Nicholas Lawson; and Lillie Wallace. Subsequent statements revealed that he identified another woman, Janet Horseburgh, as an accomplice.|$|E
5|$|The arch gateway at {{the western}} end of the churchyard bears a skull and {{crossbones}} at the top of each pillar. The memorials in the churchyard are mainly dated 1750–1850, and most are lined against the churchyard's south wall or are flush with the ground. Some show fine carving, commensurate with commercial success. They include the memorials of French-born wine merchant Jean Gaudin and the Litherland brothers, founders of Royal Crown Derby. From 1804, French prisoners of war were quartered in Ashby, and those who died before their release, or who stayed and married <b>local</b> <b>women,</b> are also buried in the churchyard. A group of memorials are for members of a prosperous local family, the Mammatts. Edward Mammatt, church organist for 40 years and a successful scientist despite being blinded at age six, also has a monument in the church, and one of the Victorian windows is dedicated to his widow by their sons.|$|E
