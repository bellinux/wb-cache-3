60|$|Tito {{was soon}} down among the crowd, and, {{notwithstanding}} his indifferent reply to Nello's question about his chance acquaintance, {{he was not}} without a passing wish, {{as he made his}} way round the piazza to the Corso degli Adimari, that he might encounter the pair of blue eyes which had looked up towards him from under the square bit of white <b>linen</b> <b>drapery</b> that formed the ordinary hood of the contadina at festa time. He was perfectly well aware that that face was Tessa's; but he had not chosen to say so. What had Nello to do with the matter? Tito had an innate love of reticence--let us say a talent for it--which acted as other impulses do, without any conscious motive, and, like all people to whom concealment is easy, he would now and then conceal something which had as little the nature of a secret as the fact that he had seen a flight of crows.|$|E
50|$|Chard {{had been}} an {{important}} commercial centre in the eighteenth century, based on <b>linen</b> <b>drapery,</b> shoemaking, wool and machine-made lace and cloth manufacture; during the canal age, a canal was built to connect the town to the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal at Creech St. Michael. It was completed in 1842 {{but it was never}} commercially viable.|$|E

50|$|In 1615, {{a market}} charter was {{granted to the}} bailiff and {{inhabitants}} of Wolsingham, and in 1667 the charter was confirmed with {{the appointment of a}} piece of land to hold the market and fairs.

2500|$|Johnson was {{consulted}} by Théodore de Mayerne on handling orpiment (a poisonous yellow pigment) {{and painted}} his portrait. In addition to describing his usage of orpiment to de Mayerne, Johnson also told Daniel King his technique for <b>draperies.</b> For <b>linen</b> <b>draperies</b> he used [...] "white and oker broken with bone black". For blue draperies, he first laid in [...] "all the background folds and shadows ... neatly and perfectly finished" [...] with [...] "indico ground in drying oiland mixt wth smalt and white".

50|$|Palmers {{can trace}} its history back to June 1837 when Garwood Burton Palmer opened a small <b>linens</b> and <b>drapery</b> shop in Great Yarmouth Market Place. In 1844 {{his younger brother}} Nathaniel Palmer joined the {{business}}. In 1888, when Garwood Palmer {{died at the age}} of 73, the business transferred into the hands of Nathaniel Palmer's sons and the business became known as Palmer Brothers.

50|$|In the 1620s Andrewes {{followed}} {{the lead of}} his father Robert and traded with the Plymouth Colony. During the 1630s he traded with the New England colonies, and {{as a member of}} the guild of the Leathersellers' Company, ran a successful wholesale <b>linen</b> <b>drapery</b> business at the White Lion, Fish Street Hill. By the end of the decade he had been the master of the guild (from 1638 to 1639), and had made enough money to be become an undersharer holder in a syndicate that farmed customs (a speculative venture where the syndicate paid the Crown a fixed sum against the hope of collecting a larger sum from those who owed custom revenue to the Crown).|$|E
60|$|A {{full moon}} {{hung over the}} white city, and the drowsy murmur of the surf broke fitfully through {{the music of the}} {{artillery}} band when Austin sat listlessly on a bench in the plaza of Santa Cruz. It was about eight o'clock in the evening, and the plaza was crowded, as usual at that hour. Peon and officer, merchant and clerk, paced slowly up and down, enjoying the cool of the evening with their wives and daughters, or sat in clusters outside the lighted cafÃ©s. The band was an excellent one, the crowd gravely good-humoured, and picturesquely attired, for white <b>linen,</b> pale-tinted <b>draperies,</b> sombre cloth, and green uniform formed patches of kaleidoscopic colouring as the stream of humanity flowed by under the glaring lamplight and the soft radiance of the moon.|$|R
