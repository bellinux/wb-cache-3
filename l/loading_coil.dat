25|$|In 1925 and 1926, Blumlein and John Percy Johns {{designed}} {{an improved}} form of <b>loading</b> <b>coil</b> which reduced loss and crosstalk in long-distance telephone lines. These were used {{until the end}} of the analogue telephony era. The same duo also invented an improved form of AC measurement bridge which became known as the Blumlein Bridge. These two inventions were the basis for Blumlein's first two patents.|$|E

25|$|A {{twisted pair}} that has {{intentionally}} added inductance, formerly common practice on telecommunication lines. The added inductors {{are known as}} <b>load</b> <b>coils</b> and reduce attenuation for voiceband frequencies but increase it on higher frequencies. <b>Load</b> <b>coils</b> reduce distortion in voiceband on very long lines. In this context a line without <b>load</b> <b>coils</b> {{is referred to as}} an unloaded line.|$|R
40|$|Abstract in Undetermined This paper {{deals with}} {{detection}} and localization of <b>load</b> <b>coils</b> in the copper access network. The <b>load</b> <b>coil</b> is a legacy device {{that must be}} removed before deploying broadband services on twisted-pair transmission lines. The proposed methods do not require dedicated hardware but utilize the already installed transceivers for one-port measurements of the line input impedance. The number of <b>load</b> <b>coils</b> is detected by {{counting the number of}} resonance peaks in the line impedance spectrum. An approximative model of the symmetric loaded line is presented, from which a low-complexity <b>load</b> <b>coil</b> locator is derived. For nonsymmetric lines, a <b>load</b> <b>coil</b> locator using model-based optimization is proposed. The two methods are compared and evaluated by computer simulations and by laboratory measurements on real transmission lines. The estimation results indicate that up to five <b>load</b> <b>coils</b> can be robustly detected and located with the proposed methods...|$|R
50|$|Because DSL {{operates}} {{above the}} 3.4 kHz voice limit, it cannot {{pass through a}} <b>load</b> <b>coil,</b> which is an inductive coil {{that is designed to}} counteract loss caused by shunt capacitance (capacitance between the two wires of the twisted pair). <b>Load</b> <b>coils</b> are commonly set at regular intervals in lines placed only for POTS. A DSL signal cannot pass through a properly installed and working <b>load</b> <b>coil,</b> while voice service cannot be maintained past a certain distance without such coils. Therefore, some areas that are within range for DSL service are disqualified from eligibility because of <b>load</b> <b>coil</b> placement. Because of this, phone companies endeavor to remove <b>load</b> <b>coils</b> on copper loops that can operate without them, and by conditioning other lines to avoid them through the use of fiber to the neighborhood or node (FTTN).|$|R
2500|$|A <b>loading</b> <b>coil</b> or {{load coil}} is an {{inductor}} that is inserted into an electronic circuit {{to increase its}} inductance. [...] A <b>loading</b> <b>coil</b> is not a transformer as it does not provide coupling to another circuit. [...] The term originated in the 19th century for inductors used to prevent signal distortion in long-distance telegraph transmission cables. The term is also used for inductors in radio antennas, or between the antenna and its feedline, to make an electrically short antenna resonant at its operating frequency.|$|E
2500|$|So {{to make an}} {{electrically}} short antenna resonant, a <b>loading</b> <b>coil</b> {{is inserted}} in series with the antenna. [...] The inductive reactance of the coil is equal and opposite to, and cancels, the capacitive reactance of the antenna, so the loaded antenna presents a pure resistance to the transmission line, preventing energy from being reflected.|$|E
2500|$|George Campbell {{was another}} AT {{engineer}} working in their Boston facility. [...] Campbell was tasked with continuing {{the investigation into}} Stone's bimetallic cable, but soon abandoned it in favour of the <b>loading</b> <b>coil.</b> His was an independent discovery, Campbell was aware of Heaviside's work in discovering the Heaviside condition, but unaware of Heaviside's suggestion of using loading coils to enable a line to meet it. [...] The motivation for the change of direction was Campbell's limited budget.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} a magnetically coupled wireless power system that uses printed spiral coils arranged in a straight resonator form to supply one or two loads. An experimental study, considering different combinations of resonator and <b>load</b> <b>coils,</b> was carried out. The total efficiency {{of the system and}} the efficiency of each <b>load</b> <b>coil</b> were compared with direct transmission system that uses only a source and a <b>load</b> <b>coil...</b>|$|R
50|$|Campbell's work on <b>loading</b> <b>coils</b> {{provided}} the theoretical basis for his subsequent work on filters which {{proved to be}} so important for frequency-division multiplexing. The cut-off phenomena of <b>loading</b> <b>coils,</b> an undesirable side-effect, can be exploited to produce a desirable filter frequency response.|$|R
50|$|The {{phenomenon}} of cutoff whereby frequencies above the cutoff frequency are not transmitted is an undesirable {{side effect of}} <b>loading</b> <b>coils</b> (although it proved highly useful {{in the development of}} filters). Cutoff is avoided by the use of continuous loading since it arises from the lumped nature of the <b>loading</b> <b>coils.</b>|$|R
2500|$|A common {{application}} of loading coils {{is to improve}} the voice-frequency amplitude response characteristics of the twisted balanced pairs in a telephone cable. [...] Because twisted pair is a balanced format, half the <b>loading</b> <b>coil</b> must be inserted in each leg of the pair to maintain the balance. [...] It is common for both these windings to be formed on the same core. [...] This increases the flux linkages, without which the number of turns on the coil would need to be increased.|$|E
2500|$|A short dipole is a dipole {{formed by}} two {{conductors}} {{with a total}} length L substantially less than a half wavelength (Î»/2), the minimum length at which the antenna is resonant at the operating frequency. [...] In {{order to make the}} antenna resonant to feed it efficiently a <b>loading</b> <b>coil</b> is required to cancel the antenna's capacitive reactance. [...] Short dipoles are used in applications where a full half-wave dipole would be too long and cumbersome. [...] As the length is reduced, the quantitative statements below become exact.|$|E
2500|$|Another type of <b>loading</b> <b>coil</b> is used {{in radio}} antennas. [...] Monopole and dipole radio antennas are {{designed}} to act as resonators for radio waves; the power from the transmitter, applied to the antenna through the antenna's transmission line, excites standing waves [...] of voltage and current in the antenna element. [...] To be resonant, the antenna must have a physical length of {{one quarter of the}} wavelength of the radio waves used (or a multiple of that length). [...] At resonance the antenna acts electrically as a pure resistance, absorbing all the power applied to it from the transmitter.|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} {{wirelessly}} transmitting power or data is disclosed. The method may include the step {{of providing a}} transmitter including a driver coil and a first transmitter resonator coil. The driver coil may have a driver coil resonance frequency, and the first transmitter coil may have a first transmitter resonator coil resonance frequency. The method may further include the step of providing a receiver including a <b>load</b> <b>coil</b> having a <b>load</b> <b>coil</b> resonance frequency. Furthermore, the method may include tuning the first transmitter coil resonance frequency {{to be higher than}} both of the driver coil resonance frequency and the <b>load</b> <b>coil</b> resonance frequency.

50|$|The {{required}} {{increase in}} L {{is achieved by}} loading the cable with a metal with high magnetic permeability. It is also possible to load a cable of conventional construction by adding discrete <b>loading</b> <b>coils</b> at regular intervals. This is not identical to a distributed loading, the difference being that with <b>loading</b> <b>coils</b> there is distortionless transmission up to a definite cut-off frequency beyond which the attenuation increases rapidly.|$|R
50|$|Without <b>loading</b> <b>coils,</b> {{the line}} {{response}} {{is dominated by}} the resistance and capacitance of the line with the attenuation gently increasing with frequency. With <b>loading</b> <b>coils</b> of exactly the right inductance, neither capacitance nor inductance dominate: the response is flat, waveforms are undistorted and the characteristic impedance is resistive up to the cutoff frequency. The coincidental formation of an audio frequency filter is also beneficial in that noise is reduced.|$|R
2500|$|Michael Pupin, {{inventor}} and Serbian immigrant to the USA, {{also played}} a part in the story of loading coils. [...] Pupin filed a rival patent to the one of Campbell's. [...] This patent of Pupin's dates from 1899. [...] There is an earlier patent (1894, filed December 1893) which is sometimes cited as Pupin's <b>loading</b> <b>coil</b> patent but is, in fact, something different. [...] The confusion is easy to understand, Pupin himself claims that he first thought of the idea of loading coils while climbing a mountain in 1894, although there is nothing from him published at that time.|$|E
2500|$|The {{origin of}} the <b>loading</b> <b>coil</b> {{can be found in}} the work of Oliver Heaviside on the theory of {{transmission}} lines. [...] Heaviside (1881) represented the line as a network of infinitesimally small circuit elements. [...] By applying his operational calculus to the analysis of this network he discovered (1887) what has become known as the Heaviside condition. [...] This is the condition that must be fulfilled in order for a transmission line to be free from distortion. [...] The Heaviside condition is that the series impedance, Z, must be proportional to the shunt admittance, Y, at all frequencies. [...] In terms of the primary line coefficients the condition is: ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{sources have}} noted Earhart's {{apparent}} {{lack of understanding of}} her direction-finding system, which had been fitted to the aircraft just prior to the flight. The system was equipped with a new receiver from Bendix that operated on five wavelength [...] "bands", marked 1 to 5. The loop antenna was equipped with a tuneable <b>loading</b> <b>coil</b> that changed the effective length of the antenna to allow it to work efficiently at different wavelengths. The tuner on the antenna was also marked with five settings, 1 to 5, but, critically, these were not the same frequency bands as the corresponding bands on the radio. The two were close enough for settings 1, 2 and 3, but the higher frequency settings, 4 and 5, were entirely different. Earhart's only training on the system was a brief introduction by Joe Gurr at the Lockheed factory, and the topic had not come up. A card displaying the band settings of the antenna was mounted so it was not visible. Gurr explained that higher frequency bands would offer better accuracy and longer range.|$|E
50|$|<b>Loading</b> <b>coils</b> {{were not}} without their problems. In heavy {{submarine}} cables, <b>loading</b> <b>coils</b> {{were difficult to}} lay. Discontinuities where the coils were installed caused stresses in the cable during laying. Without great care, the cable might part and {{would be difficult to}} repair. A second problem was that the material science of the time had difficulties sealing the joint between coil and cable against ingress of seawater. When this occurred the cable was ruined.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a magnetic resonance {{wireless power transfer}} (WPT) system that uses three coils, a planar receiver and operates at 6. 78 MHz,. Effective power transfer is ensured by establishing an impedance matching condition for this WPT system. A metamaterial (MTM) array having dimensions of 20 cm. 30 cm is also positioned near the <b>load</b> <b>coil</b> to concentrate the magnetic field and enhance the transfer efficiency. The result is a maximal improvement of 27 % in the transfer efficiency at a transfer distance of 50 cm. The impact of a ground plane on the transfer efficiency is also examined. By utilizing the MTM array, making slits on the ground plane and increasing {{the gap between the}} ground plane and the <b>load</b> <b>coil,</b> it is possible to mitigate this impact. The highest transfer efficiency improvement is about 55 % at a distance of 20 cm with the ground plane. A practical laptop model is fabricated to verify the impact of the <b>load</b> <b>coil</b> angle and position on the transfer efficiency. The result shows that the maximum transfer efficiency with the laptop model is 47. 58 % with the <b>load</b> <b>coil</b> angle of 90 degree(1) ...|$|R

5000|$|In 1897 Campbell went to {{work for}} AT&T in Boston. He {{developed}} a method for transmitting analog telephony over much greater distances than had previously been possible by the insertion of <b>loading</b> <b>coils</b> into the line at carefully calculated intervals to increase the inductance. Engineer Michael I. Pupin also patented a similar system and AT&T paid Pupin a very large sum for his patents, so that development would continue without a legal battle. In fact, neither man was the first to suggest the idea of <b>loading</b> <b>coils,</b> that credit goes to Oliver Heaviside in an 1887 article. [...] Heaviside, however, never patented the idea; indeed, he took no commercial advantage of any of his brilliant work. [...] Despite the rather arcane legal arguments surrounding this, it is unquestionable that Campbell was the first to actually construct a telephone circuit using <b>loading</b> <b>coils.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Unloaded phantom is {{a phantom}} {{configuration}} of loaded lines (a circuit fitted with <b>loading</b> <b>coils).</b> The idea {{here is not}} to create additional circuits. Rather, the purpose is to cancel or greatly reduce the effect of the <b>loading</b> <b>coils</b> fitted to a line. The reason for doing this is that loaded lines have a definite cut-off frequency and it may be desired to equalise the line to a frequency which is higher than this, for example to make a circuit suitable for use by a broadcaster. Ideally, the loading would be removed or reduced for a permanent connection, but this is not feasible for temporary arrangements such as a requirement for outside broadcast. Instead, two circuits in a phantom configuration can be used to greatly reduce the inductance being inserted by the <b>loading</b> <b>coils,</b> and hence the loading effect.|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes an {{autonomous}} coil alignment system (ACAS) for electric vehicles (EVs) with dynamic wireless charging (DWC) {{to mitigate the}} reduction in received power caused by lateral misalignment between the source and <b>load</b> <b>coils.</b> The key component of the ACAS is a novel sensor coil design, which can detect the <b>load</b> <b>coilâs</b> left or right position relative to the source coil by observing the change in voltage phase.

The feasibility of the overall operation of the ACAS was verified through simulation and experiments.
