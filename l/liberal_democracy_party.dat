The paper argues that the years between 1987 and 1994 represented a critical and dramatic shift in the ANC's relationship with liberal democratic values in which it came to openly state its acceptance of institutionalised pluralism and rights. It also argues, however, that despite the momentous and extremely valuable nature of these commitments for the consolidation of <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> in South Africa, there remain suggestions within the language and discourse of the ANC that are problematic for its full realisation, the essence of which lies in the ANC's own understanding and interpretation {{of the meaning of}} liberal democrac...|$|R

40|$|American {{legislative}} {{studies in}} recent years have been occupied to a large degree with the question of the effects of political parties on the policy behavior of elected legislators, with most of the research focusing on the U. S. Congress. We undertake a comparative analysis of state legislatures for a window into the character and extent of party’s effects. Specifically, we compare the impact of party on the partisan polarization and dimensionality of campaign issue stances and roll call voting in the Kansas Senate and the largely comparable, though nonpartisan, Nebraska Unicameral. This comparison offers us a nice quasi-experiment {{to assess the impact of}} party by establishing a baseline condition in Nebraska for what happens when party is absent. We argue that party lends order to conflict, producing the ideological low-dimensional space that is a trademark of American politics. Where parties are not active in the legislature—Nebraska is our test case—the clear structure found in partisan politics disappears. This works to sever the connection between voters and their elected representatives and, with it, the likelihood of electoral accountability that is essential for the health of <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy.</b> Political <b>parties</b> are widely considered to be necessary for modern democracies.

40|$|Populist extremist parties (PEPs) {{present one}} of the most {{pressing}} challenges to European <b>democracies.</b> These <b>parties</b> share two core features: they fiercely oppose immigration and rising ethnic and cultural diversity; and they pursue a populist ‘anti-establishment’ strategy that attacks mainstream parties and is ambivalent if not hostile towards <b>liberal</b> representative <b>democracy.</b> These <b>parties</b> and their supporters remain poorly understood. What drives some citizens to abandon the mainstream in favour of populist extremists? What message are these parties offering, and how receptive are European electorates to this message? How, if at all, can mainstream parties counter the rise of PEPs? This report examines what is causing citizens across Europe to shift behind populist extremists, and how mainstream elites might respond to this challenge. It puts popular stereotypes to one side and adopts an objective and evidence-based approach to investigate the characteristics and concerns of PEP supporters, the message and the wider potential of populist extremism, and possible response strategies...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} when economic sanctions should {{be imposed on}} <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies</b> that violate democratic norms. The argument is made from the social-liberal standpoint, which recognises the moral status of political communities. While social liberals rarely refer {{to the use of}} economic sanctions as a pressure tool, by examining why they restrict military intervention and economic aid to cases of massive human rights violations or acute humanitarian need, the article is able to show why they are likely to impose strong restrictions on the use of economic sanctions as well. After reconstructing the social-liberalcase against economic sanctions, the article develops the argument that <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies</b> have reasons to support sanctions on other <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies,</b> even when they perpetrate injustices on a smaller scale. <b>Liberal</b> <b>democracies</b> share especially strong ideological, cultural and institutional bonds, and these peer group relations open them to mutual influence. When one <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> commits serious injustices while still proclaiming allegiance to the democratic ethos, it can adversely affect the vitality of the democratic culture in those other <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies</b> with which it maintains close relations. Other <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies</b> therefore have the right and the obligation to condemn this behaviour, in order to preserve their allegiance to their values. The article defends the use of economic sanctions in light of some recent critiques, and concludes by providing an overall assessment of the factors which <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies</b> ought to take into account when they consider imposing economic sanctions on other <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Reforms and {{revolutions}} helped move most European countries towards <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy.</b> Liberalism ceased being {{a fringe}} opinion {{and joined the}} political mainstream. At the same time, a number of non-liberal ideologies developed that took the concept of <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> and made it their own.

50|$|Coleman (2002) uses {{economic}} {{cost-benefit analysis}} to reach conclusions similar to Kant's. Coleman examines the polar cases of autocracy and <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy.</b> In both cases, {{the costs of}} war {{are assumed to be}} borne by the people. In autocracy, the autocrat receives the entire benefits of war, while in a <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> the benefits are dispersed among the people. Since the net benefit to an autocrat exceeds the net benefit to a citizen of a <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy,</b> the autocrat is more likely to go to war. The disparity of benefits and costs can be so high that an autocrat can launch a welfare-destroying war when his net benefit exceeds the total cost of war. Contrarily, the net benefit of the same war to an individual in a <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> can be negative so that he would not choose to go to war. This disincentive to war is increased between <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies</b> through their establishment of linkages, political and economic, that further raise the costs of war between them. Therefore, <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies</b> are less likely to go war, especially against each other. Coleman further distinguishes between offensive and defensive wars and finds that <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies</b> are less likely to fight defensive wars that may have already begun due to excessive discounting of future costs.|$|R
40|$|We {{distinguish}} between {{three sets of}} rights 2 ̆ 013 property rights, political rights, and civil rights 2 ̆ 013 and provide a taxonomy of political regimes. The distinctive nature of <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> is that it protects civil rights (equality before the law for minorities) {{in addition to the}} other two. When democratic transitions are the product of a settlement between the elite (who care mostly about property rights) and the majority (who care mostly about political rights), they generically fail to produce <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy.</b> This is because the minority has neither the resources nor the numbers to make a contribution to the settlement. We develop a formal model to sharpen the contrast between electoral and <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies</b> and highlight circumstances under which <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> can emerge. We show that <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> requires quite special circumstances: mild levels of income inequality as well as weak identity cleavages. We provide some evidence consistent with this result, and also present a new classification of countries as electoral or <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies...</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to prove the {{hypothesis}} that <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> could trigger conflict when implemented to a post-conflict country. During the last decades {{there has been a}} debate regarding whether the implementation of liberal peacebuilding and <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> is a mean for peace or a mean for conflict. Researchers arguing for the importance of democracy claims that it is the most peaceful regime and that democracies almost never engage in war. The critics of the <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> argue that the norms and values that characterizes the <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> is not suited for countries with other norms, {{that it is not a}} substantial mean for promoting human development and security and that the peacebuilding efforts of the West simply is a mean to control the world security. I have in this thesis presented the research debate and placed myself amongst the critics of the <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy.</b> The case of Liberia was used to try and prove the hypothesis. The method used is qualitative. I have used a qualitative text analysis as well as the method of process-tracing to process the information. The theories used are the democratic peace theory and the congruence theory. The research questions which I have based my study on are the following; Could the implementation of <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> as a mean for peace, on the contrary bring conflict instead? Was it the <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> that casued a continuation of the conflict in Liberia? The results found is that the transition towards <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> does entail conflictual elements and that there is the possibility of an aggravation of the conflict unless certain factors such as the timing of election and the level of security are thought of. In the case of Liberia there are facts showing that the <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> could have aggravated the conflict, there are however other factors playing a role in this as well and I have therefore not been able to draw the conclusion that my hypothesis is true. Nonetheless I have been able to draw the conclusion that the implementing of <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> is a potential factor behind the continuation of violence in Liberia. The <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> did not create peace as the democratic peace theory suggests. ...|$|R

40|$|Much {{work has}} been done in recent {{political}} theory {{on the question of the}} appropriate scope of international involvement in the internal affairs of states.
