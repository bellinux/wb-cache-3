50|$|The canal's {{construction}} was beset with problems including finance and poor weather.

The canal bank near Lochgilphead failed in 1805 and the canal's course was diverted to avoid the marshy ground.

50|$|Similarly, {{many banks}} {{implement}} some {{variant of the}} two-man rule to secure {{large sums of money}} and valuable items. Under this concept, unlocking the vault requires two individuals with different keys if the vault is secured by a key <b>lock</b> system. For <b>bank</b> vaults secured by combination lock, one individual will know half of the combination and a second person will know the remaining half. At no point will either person know the other person's half of the lock combination, requiring both persons to be physically present in order to unlock the vault.|$|R

5000|$|Yale {{was born}} in Middletown, Connecticut, and later moved with his parents to Salisbury, New York. He married Chlotilda Hopson, September 27, 1815, and they had four children.

[...] Yale opened a lock shop in the early 1840s {{in the village of}} Newport, New York, specializing in <b>bank</b> <b>locks.</b> In 1850 his son, Linus Yale Jr. joined him at the lock shop and began working on improving his father’s pin tumbler lock.|$|R
5000|$|Yale’s second great {{invention}} {{came around}} 1863, which he coined the name [...] "Yale’s Magic Infallible Safe/Door Lock". This lock has {{many of the}} scintillating qualities of the Yale <b>Bank</b> <b>Lock,</b> and is designed for fire-proof safes and cash doors, among other items. It does not utilize springs, and is powder, damp, fire, and thief proof. The lock is not, however, a permutation lock, but each lock is unique and two different locks can never be opened with the same key. In addition, the key must be withdrawn from the lock before the bolt can be unlocked, preventing the liability of carelessly leaving {{the key in the}} keyhole.|$|R
50|$|Powers to {{increase}} its depth were obtained in 1828, and the residents of Selby used legal action {{to ensure that the}} company complied with its own Act of Parliament. The locks were enlarged in 1885, and subsequent history was uneventful, with the canal eventually coming under the control of British Waterways in 1962. When British Waterways also took control of the River Ouse, the canal was marketed as part of a through route to York, and the number of boats using it have steadily increased. Although not originally part of the canal, the section of the Aire from Dole <b>Bank</b> <b>Lock</b> to Haddlesey Flood Lock is usually considered {{to be part of the}} modern Selby Canal, making it 11.7 mi long with four locks.|$|R
5000|$|Bolivian {{postage stamps}} are a {{classical}} {{illustration of the}} problems caused by irregularities in production {{and the impact of}} large-scale inflation. Bolivia was one of the South American countries that made efforts to commemorate pre-Columbian times in the images used on the stamps. The [...] "Gate of the sun" [...] set of nineteen stamps was authorised in 1926 to commemorate Bolivia's independence. The stamps were engraved and printed in Germany, and on learning that the stamps had been sold without permission in Europe, the authorities ordered the rest to be <b>locked</b> in a <b>bank</b> vault where they remained for thirty-five years. When eventually they were released in 1960, inflation had caused havoc to Bolivia's currency and they needed to be surcharged, sometimes to 10,000 times their original denomination. The highest value five boliviano stamp was surcharged to become five thousand bolivianos.|$|R
