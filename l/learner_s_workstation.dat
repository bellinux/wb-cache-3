Detection of a <b>learner</b> <b>s</b> emotional state was done by collecting and analysing 23 participants keystroke dynamics (how people type on their keyboard), and additionally pulse (heart rate) for five participants, in an online JavaScript tutorial developed for this research. Participants self-reported their emotional state, selecting one of six predefined states, hypothesised to be relevant for a learning situation. These emotions were: Bored, concentrated, confused, delighted, frustrated and surprised. Both multiclass and binary classifiers were trained and tested on the dataset. In the binary classifiers, five classes were aggregated and classified against the sixth. Classification was tested on the whole population, and on individual participants. Every experiment was done with and without pulse features included to see if pulse influenced the classification. Binary classifiers, using the whole population as a dataset, yielded the most promising results with accuracies ranging between 60 % and 100 %. Pulse was not found to give a better classification in this research. No conclusive results may be given however, as there are limitations in both the dataset and how the pulse feature was implemented.

" In previous reviews (Goldstein & Blackman 1977, 1978; Blackman & Goldstein, Note 1) cognitive style has been conceptual-ized as an individual's characteristic ap-proach to processing information. We will show how certain cognitive styles have been related to aspects of learning disa-bilities and will cite literature indicating that cognitive styles can be successfully modified, with the presumption that such modification leads to improved school performance. We also will cite literature indicating that placing children into learning environments that are appropri-ate to their cognitive styles results in improved learning. We do not know whether learning dis-abilities are the cause or result of an individual's cognitive style or whether both are related to a third variable. The fact remains that the two are correlated, and that procedures exist for modifying cognitive style. It is an empirical ques-tion as to whether such modification will improve school learning.

40|$|Pas de résumé en françaisThe goal of {{our studies}} was {{to test the}} effect of segmentation, cueing, and 2 D/ 3 D presentations to foster complex {{animation}} rocessing. The material was an upright mechanical piano system. We used an eye tracking system which provides information about learners attention direction during the animation processing. We analyzed {{the effect of the}} format presentations and the eye movements during learning. Based on animation and multimedia research background, four experiments were conducted. In the first experiment the effect of the presentation of simplified external representations on learning from complex animation was investigated. Experiment two and three aimed at studying the cognitive processes involved in learning to complex mechanism system with new cueing techniques with spatial-temporal colored tokens. In the fourth experiment, 2 D and 3 D presentation of the same animated content were compared. Results of these experiments showed that (1) the use of a dual format presentation is better for developing a dynamic mental model from the animation than a single format, (2) the signaling strategies using cued tokens of dual format can guide efficiently <b>learner</b> <b>s</b> building of mental model and can enhance <b>learner</b> <b>s</b> comprehension of complex system, (3) a sequential format presentation followed by an animation format presentation helps the learner to understand the key stages of a dynamic process and to create a high quality mental model, (4) 3 D animation presentation is better than 2 D animation presentation to direct attention on relevant component of the animation. For depth processing, comprehension with 3 D animation presentation is better than 2 D animation format. Eye tracking measures provided insights into how people understood and learned complex systems. The analysis of eye tracking also contributed {{to the understanding of the}} subject s perceptual processing during learning. Overall, results provide a significant contribution in the field of learning with complex animation. Recommendations in the ergonomics area for the design of animations are proposed.

This paper takes the empirically observed violations of Savage s (1954) sure thing principle seriously and asks whether Bayesian learners with ambiguity attitudes will reduce their ambiguity when sample information becomes large. To address this question, I develop closed-form models of Bayesian learning in which beliefs are described as Choquet estimators with respect to neo-additive capacities (Chateauneuf, Eichberger, and Grant 2007). Under the optimistic, the pessimistic, and the full Bayesian update rule, a Bayesian <b>learner</b> <b>s</b> ambiguity will increase rather than decrease to the e¤ect that these agents will express ambiguity attitudes regardless of whether they have access to large sample information or not.

The typ 0 of inference involved depends on the input information, the current (background) knowledge and the learne's task,. at h, and: Based on such a view of learning, several fundamental concepts are ananzeu ano clarified, in particular, analytic and synthetic learning, derivational and hypothetical explanation, constructive induction, abduction, abstraction and deductive generalization. It is shown that inductive generalization and abduction {{can be viewed as}} two basic forms of general induction, and that abstraction and deductive generalization are two related forms of constructive deduction. Using this conceptual framework, a methodology for multistrategy task-adaptive learning (MTL) is outlined, in which learning strategies are combined dynamically, depending on the current learning situation. Specifically, an MTL learner anali?es a "triad" relationship among the input information, the background knowledge and the learning task, and on that basis determines which strategy, or a combination thereof, is most appropriate at a given learning step. To implement the MTL methodology, a new knowledge representation is proposed, based on the parametric association rules (PARs). Basic ideas of MTL are illustrated by means of the well-known "cup" example, through which is shown how an MTL leamer can employ, depending on the above triad relationship, emprical learning, constructive inductive generalization, abduction, explanation-based learning and abstraction...|$|R

Though relevant {{research has been done}} for centuries, there are and there will be always room for improvement, adaptations, and changes of methods, techniques and strategies, provided that language, itself, is a living being and, therefore, the basic components of its corpus, words, come into light, become part of the corpus, and then die. We emphasize on the importance of teaching vocabulary through schematic and well-documented information. As a result of an extensive bibliography, some field research, and our own experimentation we {{have come to the conclusion}} that all the above-cited sources reveal the necessity to improve the methodology to teach vocabulary by giving students the opportunity of being spontaneous with their written and spoken language, which allows them to become starring participants of the teaching learning process. Further on, our thesis statement points out to detailed literature on language classroom interaction, so that readers can understand thoroughly the role and scope of classroom interaction, which is expected to be applied in the language- learning process.

No COTS browser performs all the functions NIFTI does, and NIFTI is easier to use. NIFTI s cost savings are very significant considering the very large database with which it is used and the large user community with varying data requirements it will support. Its ease of use means that personnel unfamiliar with databases (e. g., managers, supervisors, clerks, and others) can develop their own personal reports. For NASA, a tool such as NIFTI was needed to query, update, modify, and make deletions within the ISS vehicle master database (VMDB), a repository of engineering data that includes an indentured parts list and associated resource data (power, thermal, volume, weight, and the like). Since the VMDB is used both as a collection point for data and as a common repository for engineering, integration, and operations teams, a tool such as NIFTI had to be designed that could expedite the creation of database query/update forms which could then be shared among users...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Children {{come from}} all {{different}} socioeconomic backgrounds, past educational experiences, and levels of parental involvement. Each and every child will be at a unique literacy level with differences spanning in reading comprehension, word analysis, use of reading strategies, written communication, and other key areas. Education tends to follow "hot topics" and trends of research, but a balanced reading approach to literacy {{will continue to be}} vital in reaching the spectrum of students. Research was conducted through both a literary review of educational resources and a sixteen week student teaching experience to construct four individual units for use in a fourth grade balanced literacy program. In a balanced literacy program, classroom teachers have a great responsibility to provide students with instruction that meets the needs of those particular <b>learners.</b> B. <b>S.</b> Ed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} our work on the [...] development and testing of an automated feedback tool based on Computer-Adaptive Testing. Computer-adaptive tests (CATs) are software applications that adapt the presentation of test questions to the <b>learner</b> <b>s</b> proficiency level, so that those performing well are given more difficult questions and vice versa. In this paper, we present and describe {{the development of the}} models used in a feedback tool based on this approach. The model includes a proficiency level estimation based on Item Response Theory and also a questions database. The [...] questions in the database are classified according to topic area and difficulty level. The difficulty level is initially set by expert evaluation based upon Bloom s taxonomy and adapted according to students [...] performance over time. The output from our adaptive test is a continuously updated student model that estimates proficiency in each of the domain areas covered in the test, relating not only to performance, but also to cognitive ability, based on Bloom s levels. [...] Earlier work has shown that the approach we adopt is reliable and fair to students and provides useful and important measures of ability. Potentially these measures may be used, not only in formative and [...] summative assessment, but also to help in the delivery of learning or remedial activities based on individual ability. We describe our student model based on adaptive testing and show how it was used to provide automated feedback for students in a summative assessment context. The evaluation of our feedback tool by groups of learners and teachers [...] suggested that our approach was a valid one, capable of providing useful advice for individual development. A survey of staff attitude supported this view. The results of these evaluations are presented in this paper. In the concluding section of the paper we suggest ways that [...] the student profiles created by our method are likely to be useful in a variety of learning contexts...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we study the {{question}} of whether identifiable classes have subclasses which are identifiable under a more restrictive criterion. The chosen framework is inductive inference, in particular the criterion of explanatory learning (Ex) of recursive functions as introduced by Gold [Inform. Comput. 10 (1967) 447]. Among the more restrictive criteria is finite learning where the learner outputs, on every function to be learned, exactly one hypothesis (which has to be correct). The topic of the present paper are the natural variants (a) and (b) below of the classical question whether a given learning criterion like finite learning is more restrictive than Ex-learning. (a) Does every infinite Ex-identifiable class have an infinite finitely identifiable subclass? (b) If an infinite Ex-identifiable class S has an infinite finitely identifiable subclass, does it necessarily follow that some appropriate <b>learner</b> Ex-identifies <b>S</b> as well as finitely identifies an infinite subclass of S? These questions are also treated in the context of ordinal mind change bounds...|$|R
