The <b>linear</b> <b>sound</b> speed obtained agrees well {{with that of a}} recent experimental measurement. We then consider a weak nonlinear excitation and show that the time evolution of the excitation obeys a Korteweg de Vries equation. Different from the result obtained in quasi-one-dimensional case studied previously, where subsonic dark solitons are obtained via the balance between quantum pressure and nonlinear effect, we demonstrate that bright solitons with supersonic propagating velocity can be generated in the present three-dimensional system through the balance between a waveguidelike dispersion and the interparticle interaction.

By a consequent description of discrete implementations with State Space Structures (SSSs), suitable linear state space transformations can be used to achieve the typical DWG structure from any given system.

Experimental results show that CGPCs demonstrate excellent sound absorption performance because of their continuously graded structures. CGPCs have higher sound absorption coefficients in the large frequency range and more sound absorption coefficient peaks in a specific frequency range than UPCs and DSPCs. In particular, the sound absorption coefficients of the CGPC with a porosity of 0. 6 and thickness of 30 mm are higher than 0. 56 when the frequency is 1350 – 6300 Hz and are all higher than 0. 2 in the studied frequency range (1000 – 6300 Hz).

40|$|An {{initial value}} problem with {{relevance}} to jet noise is investigated. A plane parallel jet flow {{is subjected to}} a spatially localized initial disturbance and is then left to evolve according to the two-dimensional compressible Navier–Stokes equations. The hydrodynamic response {{is in the form}} of a convecting vortex packet. The Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings approach is formulated in the time domain and used to extrapolate from the simulated near field to the acoustic far field. The predominant downstream sound radiation comes from an early stage of nonlinear development of the vortex packet. Two simplified models to account for the radiation are introduced, based on nonlinear mode interactions on a prescribed base flow. The first uses two sets of linearized Euler equations, coupled via the inviscid Lilley–Goldstein acoustic analogy. This formulation separates the <b>linear</b> <b>sound</b> field from the sound field driven by nonlinear interactions; qualitative agreement of the latter with the Navier–Stokes computations demonstrates the importance of nonlinear interactions. The second model uses combinations of linear inviscid eigenmodes to drive the sound field, which allows extraction of the dominant mode interactions responsible for the observed radiation pattern. The results indicate that a difference-wavenumber nonlinear interaction mechanism dominates sound radiation from subsonic instability modes in shear flows...|$|E
40|$|For {{abundance}} estimation {{and species}} identification on fisheries acoustic surveys, control with temperature and finite amplitude {{effects in the}} sea demands the calibration factor C of the conventional echo-integrator equation to be fully known {{in terms of the}} sonar system’s electrical and acoustical parameters. As no such expression is available from earlier literature, the theoretical basis for the power budget and echo-integrator equations is revisited. The objective is to provide (a) a derivation of these equations for integration in a more complete functional relationship for abundance measurement, including an expression for the calibration factor C; (b) to account for electrical termination; (c) to formulate these expressions in terms of voltage signal echo integration processing; and (d) thereby generalize the Clay-Medwin formulations based on echo integration of “in-water” sound pressure signals, to account for the transducer and electronics components of the echosounder system. Under conditions of small-amplitude (<b>linear)</b> <b>sound</b> propagation, electroacoustic power budget equations are derived for the backscattering cross section in single-target backscattering, used in echosounder calibration; and the volume backscattering coefficient for multiple-target backscattering, used in oceanic surveys.

They underwent six intra-articular injections of 750 mcg of SST 14 at 15 -day intervals. The thickness of the synovial membrane (SM) was measured with a 5 -MHz <b>linear</b> <b>sound</b> with longitudinal and transversal scanning carried out on the upper patellar cavity. The contralateral knee was also assessed together with the injected knee in order to ascertain any systemic effect of the drug. A significant reduction of SM thickness was observed already at the first control (T 3) in 14 out of 16 patients. At the 5 th and 6 th injections (T 5 and T 6) the reduction was still significant but to a lower extent. In 8 out of 16 cases a reduction of SM thickness was observed in the contralateral knee. Analysis of these data clearly shows that the intra-articular injection of SST 14 is able to reduce the thickness of SM in {{patients with}} RA, and indicates that SST 14 may directly reduce synovitis.

40|$|In {{many studies}} of auditory-evoked {{responses}} to low-intensity sounds, the response amplitude appears to increase roughly linearly {{with the sound}} level in decibels (dB), corresponding to a logarithmic intensity dependence. But the auditory system {{is assumed to be}} linear in the low-intensity limit. The goal {{of this study was to}} resolve the seeming contradiction. Based on assumptions about the rate-intensity functions of single auditory-nerve fibers and the pattern of cochlear excitation caused by a tone, a model for the gross response of the population of auditory nerve fibers was developed. In accordance with signal detection theory, the model denies the existence of a threshold. This implies that regarding the detection of a significant stimulus-related effect, a reduction in sound intensity can always be compensated for by increasing the measurement time, at least in theory. The model suggests that the gross response is proportional to intensity when the latter is low (range I), and a <b>linear</b> function of <b>sound</b> level at higher intensities (range III). For intensities in between, it is concluded that noisy experimental data may provide seemingly irrefutable evidence of a <b>linear</b> dependence on <b>sound</b> pressure (range II). In view of the small response amplitudes that are to be expected for intensity range I, direct observation of the predicted proportionality with intensity will generally be a challenging task for an experimenter. Although the model was developed for the auditory nerve, the basic conclusions are probably valid for higher levels of the auditory system, too, and might help to improve models for loudness at threshold...|$|R
