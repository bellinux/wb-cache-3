Our servers have been unstable and crashing on a regular basis meaning the NZBs & NFOs are unavailable for long periods and we don't have the money to replace them.

2500|$|While {{the return}} to 2D had been met with high praise, the {{characters}} were modeled in 3D and then pre-rendered and saved in 2D sprites rather than being hand-drawn 2D sprites, which was initially met with mixed reception from fans. Cecil explained that the game was in full HD in order achieve the highest visual quality possible, but the original animations from The Shadow of the Templars and The Smoking Mirror were created in 640×400; a move to HD would require animations three times larger, and hand-animating so many pixels might be possible, but would be a [...] "massively complicated job." [...] To further quote Cecil, [...] "The massive advantage of rendering and then modelling is that obviously the data is much more manageable, we can connect animations much more smoothly, {{we can continue to}} tweak to optimise the 2D look which we’re in the process of doing, and you can hand-touch them at the end. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> have <b>said</b> that we should be doing 2D, and I totally respect their comments, but my opinion is that it’s just not feasible. I’m also very pleased with the way the sprites are looking anyway. What we probably need to do is communicate that the end result is they look like they’re sprites, they look like they’re 2D. So I don’t regret the decision at all, and I’m absolutely convinced it’s the right one. I just don’t think we’ve communicated as well as we should have done that the end results will look like cartoony 2D sprites."

Together, they invited Reba McEntire, Clarkson's mother-in-law and Blackstock's wife. She recalled, [...] "I figured if I got (McEntire), everyone {{would have to say}} yes. I've never asked an artist to do anything other than sing with me which a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> had <b>said</b> no and it hurts my feelings, which is okay." [...] Clarkson later invited a various set of musicians: Trisha Yearwood, Garth Brooks, Ronnie Dunn, Kacey Musgraves, Hayley Williams, Chad Gilbert, Charles Esten, Meghan Trainor, Martina McBride, Kix Brooks, and Deborah Allen. She revealed, [...] "I basically guilted people into it. And it was a very brave thing for me." [...] Dolly Parton, whom she had also invited, had to turn down the offer due to scheduling conflicts. Clarkson had also revealed that other recording artists had also turned down the offer for the same reason but promised to participate for a 2015 concert. On the September 5, 2015 date of her Piece by Piece Tour at the Bridgestone Arena, she announced that the 2015 edition of the benefit concert would be held on December 18, 2015. She later announced that the concert in 2015 had been cancelled because of her health problems but promised to hold another concert in 2016. The concert in 2016 was be held on December 16 and the guest musicians included Reba McEntire, Ronnie Dunn, Kelsea Ballerini, RaeLynn, Charles Esten, The SteelDrivers and more.|$|R
