5|$|After his {{graduation}} as {{an architect}} in 1878, Gaudí's first work was a set of <b>lampposts</b> for the Plaça Reial, the project for the Girossi newsstands and the Mataró cooperative, which was his first important work. He received the request from the city council of Barcelona in February 1878, when he had graduated but not yet received his degree, which was sent from Madrid on 15 March of the same year. For this commission he designed two types of lampposts: one with six arms, of which two were installed in the Plaça Reial, and another with three, of which two were installed in the Pla del Palau, opposite the Civil Government. The <b>lampposts</b> were inaugurated during the Mercè festivities in 1879. Made of cast iron with a marble base, they have a decoration in which the caduceus of Mercury is prominent, symbol of commerce and emblem of Barcelona.|$|E
5|$|During the Paris {{exposition}} in May 1910, Gaudí spent {{a holiday}} in Vic, where he designed two basalt <b>lampposts</b> and wrought iron for the Plaça Major of Vic {{in honor of}} Jaume Balmes's centenary. The following year he resided as a convalescent in Puigcerdà while suffering from tuberculosis. During this time he conceived {{the idea for the}} facade of the Passion of the Sagrada Família. Due to ill health he prepared a will at the office of the notary Ramon Cantó i Figueres on 9 June, but later completely recovered.|$|E
5|$|In May 1910 Gaudí paid a {{short visit}} to Vic, {{where he was}} tasked to design the <b>lampposts</b> for the city's Plaça Major, in {{commemoration}} of the first centenary {{of the birth of}} Jaume Balmes. They were obelisk-shaped lamps, with basalt rock bases from Castellfollit de la Roca and wrought iron arms, topped with the four-armed cross; they were decorated with vegetable themes and included the birth and death dates of Balmes. They were demolished in 1924 due to poor maintenance.|$|E

5|$|Production {{designer}} Kenneth Mak included Western {{elements in}} his design, since Foshan, in earlier years, {{was a unique}} place where Chinese and Western cultures converged. Pillars were made to resemble English <b>lampposts,</b> and Western lighting, chairs and tableware were also used. To convey the culture and feel of the time, the buildings were made to look obsolete and worn out. Apart from historical references, Mak also created a glass house which was used in a scene in the film.|$|E
5|$|The town escaped heavy bombing {{during the}} Second World War, but the sea front {{incurred}} great damage {{when it was}} fortified against invasion. The cast iron <b>lampposts</b> and benches along the front were removed and melted down for munitions, as was much of the superstructure from both Bournemouth and Boscombe piers before they were breached to prevent their use by enemy ships. The large amounts of barbed wire and anti-tank obstacles along the beach, and the mines {{at the foot of}} the chines, took two years to remove when peace was finally achieved.|$|E
5|$|Very little {{land and}} {{property}} was {{displaced by the}} project. Following the construction, the land formerly housing nine residential properties displaced during construction were leveled {{and turned into a}} park. A warehouse was reduced in size {{to make way for the}} project, as well as the relocation of Atlantic City Electric power lines leading to a substation. A promenade as part of Trump Marina was leveled to make way for new ramps, in which 37 ornamental <b>lampposts</b> which were dismantled were later shipped to the Tuckerton Seaport in nearby Tuckerton, which opened in 2000.|$|E

5|$|In Jamaica, {{flooding}} {{was reported}} on {{the east of the}} island, and mudslides occurred on the northeast coast. In Kingston, buildings collapsed and houses had their roofing torn off by the strong winds, which felled trees and <b>lampposts.</b> A shoot-out between police and looters occurred in the parish of Clarendon. Over 1,500 roofs were lost, primarily to the hurricane-force winds. 3,127houses were heavily damaged, 1,582 of which were left totally uninhabitable. Two-thirds of the homes in the southeastern parishes of Clarendon, St. Catherine, and Kingston/St. Andrew sustained significant damages. One man was killed in Clarendon by a collapsing roof, and a 14-year-old girl in Whitehorses, St. Thomas was killed by rock damage to her home. A third Jamaican was killed when he was struck by flying debris {{during the height of the}} storm.|$|E

25|$|The Tramways Committee also formalised the {{stopping}} {{places for}} the tramcars, and {{negotiated with the}} Corporation Lighting Committee to have the <b>lampposts</b> at tramstops painted in a distinctive colour with a different coloured glass in the lantern. Whether this was actually carried out is not recorded. The tramstops on Arkwright Street were determined to be Crocus Street, Cromford Street, Kirkwhite Street, Atlas Street, Glebe Street, Ryehill Street and Lamcote Street. Crocus Street and Lamcote Street were request stops only.|$|E
25|$|The District of Columbia Department of Transportation (DDOT) {{announced}} a two-year, $21 million {{rehabilitation of the}} bridge in April 2014. In addition to repairing the previously-identified structural issues, the street lights will be replaced with modern energy-efficient <b>lampposts,</b> the guard rail between the roadway and sidewalks will be strengthened, the bridge's drainage system fixed and improved, and the bridge painted. During the work, one lane of traffic a day may close. Transportation officials said they hoped to close lanes only during non-rush hours. DDOT officials said contracts for the project, 90 percent of which is funded by the federal government, would be advertised in June 2014.|$|E
