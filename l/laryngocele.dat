40|$|<b>Laryngocele</b> {{is a rare}} pathology, {{but because}} of their {{clinical}} evolution and the symptoms they generate, they should always {{be considered as a}} differential diagnosis when investigating neck masses. A <b>laryngocele</b> is basically a herniation of the mucosa of the laryngeal ventricle (Morgagni's ventricle) arising usually from the saccular region. This herniation may remain confined to the larynx - in which case the <b>laryngocele</b> is internal- or expand through the thyro-hyoid membrane into the structures of the neck - thus being called an external <b>laryngocele.</b> Usually the <b>laryngocele</b> has both an internal and external component thus being a mixed <b>laryngocele.</b> Diagnosis of laryngoceles still relies heavily on clinical signs such as tympanism, easily depressible neck mass, indirect laryngoscopy, but is now simplified by imagistic investigations (ultrasound, CT and MRI). However, the treatment of this condition is exclusively surgical and consists of total excision of the <b>laryngocele,</b> as well as proper identification of the point of origin from the saccule and also the final suture of the breach in order to prevent recurrence. Investigation of possible causes of obstruction of the laryngeal ventricle should always be performed (because of the possibility of an underlying malignancy) as well as a follow-up protocol of the patient, given the risk of relapse.

40|$|Abstract Background A <b>laryngocele</b> {{is usually}} a cystic {{dilatation}} of the laryngeal saccule. The etiology behind its occurrence is still unclear, but congenital and acquired factors have been implicated in its development. Case presentation We present a rare case of <b>laryngocele</b> occurring in a 77 -year-old Caucasian woman. The patient presented with one month history of altered voice, no other associated symptoms were reported. The medical history of the patient included respiratory failure secondary to childhood polio {{at the age of}} ten; the airway management included a surgical tracheostomy. Flexible naso-laryngoscopy revealed a soft mass arising from the posterior pharyngeal wall obscuring the view of the posterior commissure and vocal folds. The shape of the mass altered with respiration and on performing valsalva maneuver. A plain lateral neck radiograph revealed a large air filled sac originating from the laryngeal cartilages and extending along the posterior pharyngeal wall. The patient was then treated by endoscopic laser marsupialization and reviewed annually. We discuss the complications of tracheostomy and the pathophysiology of laryngoceles and in particular the likely aetiological factors in this case. Conclusion A <b>laryngocele</b> presenting in a female patient with tracheostomy is extremely rare and has not been to date reported in the world literature. A local mechanical condition may be the determinant factor in the pathogenesis of the disease. </p...|$|E

40|$|The <b>laryngocele</b> is an {{abnormal}} cystic dilatation of the saccule or appendix of the laryngeal ventricle, filled with air and {{communicating with the}} lumen of the larynx. When {{the neck of the}} <b>laryngocele</b> is obstructed, it becomes filled with mucus of the glandular secretion and is changed to a laryngomucocele. When this lesion becomes infected, a laryngopyocele is formed. The <b>laryngocele</b> is fairly rare and laryngopyocele occurs even more rarely. Overall, 39 cases of laryngopyocele {{have been reported in the}} world literature. Only in 4 cases was a laryngopyocele reported to have caused acute airway obstruction and only one case of internal laryngopyocele causing acute airway obstruction has been reported until now. This is the first case reported in the literature of an internal laryngopyocele in a female patient in a septic condition, which caused almost 100 % obstruction of the airway. An emergency tracheotomy was performed in order to secure the airway. Computed tomography of neck was performed which revealed a cystic 29 mm hypodense mass extending from the right false vocal cord to the level of the epiglottis, narrowing the laryngeal cavity and causing an almost 100 % airway obstruction. Laryngopyoceles may present with a rapid and alarming obstruction of the airway and, therefore, an urgent tracheotomy may be inevitable. It is an emergency case, in the field of otolaryngology, and should be included in the differential diagnosis of acute airway obstruction, especially when hoarseness, stridor and fever are present. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion for these lesions and scrupulous clinical and radiological evaluation. A computed tomography scan is critical in determining the nature and site of the lesion. The recommended treatment of laryngopyocele is immediate endoscopic drainage. Definitive management of laryngopyoceles is surgical excision which can be performed immediately after endoscopic drainage or some time thereafter...|$|E

40|$|Objectives. To review {{surgical}} {{techniques used}} {{in the treatment of}} laryngoceles {{over the last two decades}} and point out developments and trends. Materials and Methods. PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and the JBI Library of Systematic Reviews were searched using the term “laryngocele. ” Demographic data, type of <b>laryngocele,</b> presence of a laryngopyocele, type of treatment and need for a tracheotomy were assessed. Results. Overall, data on 86 patients were analyzed, culled from 50 articles, of which 41 were case reports and 9 were case series. No single systematic review or meta-analysis or randomized controlled trial has been published on the topic. Altogether, 71 laryngoceles in 63 patients met the criteria for further analysis focusing on surgical treatment. An external approach was selected in 25 / 29 (86. 2 %) cases of combined laryngoceles.

In this study, we report on a 65 year-old acromegalic male suffering from frequent and severe dyspnea attacks and clinical findings of respiratory upperway obstruction, besides the common acromegalic features. At the external examination of the larynx, a bilateral painless and soft mass, located in the laterocervical region under the hyoid bone, was detected. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy, showed bilateral swelling between the aryepiglottic fold and the false vocal cords, whose size increased during the expiration and the phonation, fixity of the vocal cords in paramedian position, with a marked reduction of the respiratory space and increase in arytenoid cartilage size and mucosal edema. Neck and mediastinum CT scan showed the presence of an air containing bilateral swelling, crossing the thyrohyoid membrane. Bilateral cricoarytenoidal joint chondrocalcification, associated to a mixed-type bilateral <b>laryngocele,</b> was diagnosed. Laryngoceles were both surgically removed and a left monolateral arytenoidectomy was performed, using fiberoptic microlaryngoscopy with CO 2 laser. The clinical evaluation, one month later, confirmed the complete disappearance of dyspnea and a partial improvement of phonation.

We describe a female newborn, from a Grávida II, Para 0, 36 -year-old woman, with a routine ultrasound at 30 weeks ’ gestation that showed polyhydramnios. She delivered a live-born female baby at 36 weeks without any dismorphic features but with respiratory distress. Attempts at endotracheal intubation were unsuccessful due {{to the presence of}} a mass obstructing the larynx. The reanimation process was stopped after 20 minutes. Post-mortem examination demonstrated the presence of a total occlusion of the larynx by a laryngomucocoele. <b>Laryngocele,</b> a congenital cyst of the larynx, occurs rarely and hardly ever as a cause of CHAOS.

40|$|In {{laryngeal}} mucocele, Morgagni's ventricle {{fills with}} mucous resulting from proliferation of the innner glandular epithelium and simultaneous {{closure of the}} ventricular opening. In making a diagnosis, the physician must first rule out any underlying neoplasm in Morgagni's ventricle which would {{give rise to a}} secondary mucocele. The present work reports a clinical case which came under observation because of cough, dysphonia and swelling of the left ventricular band with normal motility of the true vocal cords. CT of the neck, performed with contrast medium and axial scanning, showed a solid neoformation starting from the left laryngeal ventricle; densitometry proved moderately non homogeneous and showed radiological signs of hypervascularization. On the basis of these data the patient underwent direct bioptic laryngoscopy. During the beginning of the endoscopic maneuver, the pressure exerted by the stiff laryngoscope forced out dense, sticky mucous-like material and caused the laryngeal ventricle to collapse. Subsequently, multiple bioptic samples were taken from the walls and floor of the ventricle. The histological and microbiological examination confirmed the diagnosis of laryngeal mucocele. Six months later the laryngoscopic picture was nearly normal. In the years since computerized tomography came into clinical practice, diagnosis of this pathology has become easier and quicker Computerized tomography provides radiological indication of benignness which is certainly valid for <b>laryngocele,</b> a tumefaction containing air and which is therefore clearly differentiated from the radiodensity of the surrounding tissues. Vice versa, the homogeneous mucous content of the laryngeal mucocele can be altered by bacterial proliferation and may not show up on the CT as a uniformly hypodense area. Phlogosis due to the presence of colonies of bacteria can lead to greater blood flow in the ventricular site, thus making it impossible to distinguish the hyperdense boundary surrounding the hypodense mass. This, in turn, creates a blurry, ambiguous area of hyperdensity typical of increased vascularization. The rarity of the lesion, the relative likelihood of a simultaneous neoplasm and the ambiguousness of the clinical diagnostic elements available justify the use of preliminary bioptic microlaryngoscopy before surgically treating laryngeal mucocele...|$|E
