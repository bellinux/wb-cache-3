The paper focuses on crucial problems connected with the defi nition of small farms and with their traditional and modern functions. The paper presents farmers’ opinions about small agricultural operations, as information was collected from 100 farmers from Kozienicki county, Poland. The farmers had from 1 to 5 ha of agricultural <b>land.</b> Respondents’ <b>declarations</b> indicate that small farms perform mainly social functions. They expressed their defi nition of a small farm as one having from 1 to 10 ha of agricultural land. The majority of respondents were dissatisfi ed with their agriculture income.

40|$|Agricultural {{land on the}} Eiderstedt {{peninsula}} in Schleswig-Holstein (Germany) {{is traditionally}} dominated by extensively used grassland. These grassland areas are home to many (endangered) bird species, making Eiderstedt {{one of the prime}} bird habitats at the west coast of Schleswig-Holstein. During the last few years large shares of grassland have been converted to arable farm land to grow crops needed in an intensified dairy production and for biofuels. The possible impacts of such conversions on breeding bird populations of four key species are determined. The results indicate that the increase of arable farm land during the past six years has drastically reduced suitable bird habitat, which considerably diminishes the number of breeding pairs supported by the environment. Further land conversion is likely to have a less pronounced impact on bird populations compared to the consequences of the latest shift from grassland to arable farm <b>land.</b> Recent <b>declarations</b> of additional bird sanctuaries are supposed to alleviate the pressure on endangered bird species. Assessments using a combination of GIS and dynamic optimization models will be conducted to determine the expected efficiency of such management measures. nature conservation, agriculture...|$|R

40|$|This {{manuscript}} analyzes {{a distinctive}} period of Albanian history, {{that after the}} Balkan Wars and Conference of Ambassadors in London, a period of external political influences with many different interests to implement or prevent {{the development of the}} newly created Albanian state. In this context the article focuses in the attitude of Serbia towards Albania, with Serbia’s aim to disable the consolidation of the Albanian state. It tried to influence in the political circumstances regarding the nomination of the ruler prince or at least it tried to alter the situation in the field through its different exponents, religious or political affiliations, {{in order to make the}} longstanding dream possible to cruise through the Albanian <b>lands.</b> The <b>declaration</b> of Albanian Independence evoked great concern to the Balkans neighboring states who had dedicated Albania as war trophy. On the other hand, the Serbian politics tried to find elements which would undermine the act of Independence or to put it on a shade in any form. The interest of Serbian politics towards Albania was consistent. If we want to best understand the attitude of the Serbian politics towards Albanians, during this time, we have to analyze in a comparative manner Serbia’s politics in Albania and Kosovo and other occupied territories. While in Albania it committed itself for a Muslim prince, in the occupied Albanian territories it followed a strict anti-Islamic and anti-Albanian policy...|$|R

40|$|In What Happened to Notre Dame? (St. Augustine’s Press, 2009), Charles E. Rice, Professor Emeritus at Notre Dame Law School, traced that university’s loss of Catholic {{identity}} to the <b>Land</b> O’Lakes <b>Declaration</b> of 1967 in which Notre Dame and other “Catholic” universities declared their {{independence from the}} Church. In fact they substituted for the positive guidance of the Magisterium a counterfeit orthodoxy of political correctness, money, and secular prestige. This book, Right or Wrong, is a compilation of columns Professor Rice wrote for the campus newspaper, The Observer, from 1970 through 2010. Those bi-weekly columns are concise, readable, and practical. They offered the students an access to the authentic teachings of the Church {{that they might not}} otherwise get in the politically correct “Catholic” university of Land O’Lakes. Those columns present those teachings, not as abstractions, but as practical guides to real-life issues. Drawing upon his wide experience in constitutional law, jurisprudence, tort, and other areas, Professor Rice tells it like it is {{on a wide range of}} issues, including abortion, euthanasia, contraception, homosexuality, pornography, clergy sex abuse, feminism, marriage, bioethics, the death penalty, just war principles, the War on Terror, “Catholic” politicians, etc., etc. He describes Land O’Lakes as a “suicide pact” that has made “Catholic” universities subservient to government, corporate donors, foundations, and the secular educational establishment. Professor Rice, however, goes beyond criticism. He offers a very practical way for Notre Dame to recover its Catholic identity. And he urges that we pray, especially through the intercession of Notre Dame, Our Lady, for her University and for our country. [URL]...|$|R

Khust, in the East, the westernmost city of Northern Maramureș, remained a part of Subcarpathia-Ruthenia and the seat of its government moved there. The Chust government actively continued to voice complaints over the fate of the western Subcarpathian-Ruthenian territories and vocally asserted the region's case for its own government and the protection of its former <b>lands.</b> The Chust <b>declarations</b> increasingly included a possible attachment to an independent Ukraine.

The depression was first identified just offshore eastern Africa on September 8, near where Tropical Storm Christine formed later in the month. Tracking rapidly towards the west, the depression dissipated on September 11 over open waters. In addition to the two notable tropical depressions and two named storms in September, a slow-moving depression formed south-southeast of Bermuda on September 8. Tracking generally northward, the depression dissipated early on September 10 without affecting <b>land.</b> Upon the <b>declaration</b> of Hurricane Fran on October 10, a new depression formed southwest of the strengthening hurricane. This system rapidly tracked northeast and dissipated two days later. Later that month, a slow-moving depression formed near the Azores. This system tracked southeast and dissipated on October 30 without affecting land. The final system of the year formed near the northern coast of Panama on November 17. The depression was noted as a [...] "...strong depression..."

40|$|Climate change {{mitigation}} {{projects in}} developing countries {{have the potential for}} significant negative impacts on land users. In particular, land users with socially legitimate but informal tenure that is not recorded using a statutory process are at risk of exploitation from the powerful elite. A detailed understanding of de facto property rights is important in protecting the rights of legitimate beneficiaries of climate change mitigation projects, and this is recognized in international <b>declarations.</b> <b>Land</b> administration systems have the potential to assist in formally recognizing and recording both de jure and de facto rights to land and resources. This paper analyses the requirements for land administration in the implementation of climate change mitigation policies through payments for environmental services (PES). The authors review existing approaches to administering land tenure on climate change mitigation projects, and consider how current and innovative approaches to land administration may be applied. This discussion draws on {{a review of the literature}} as well as a review of seven climate change mitigation projects in Africa, Asia and South America. The authors argue for the importance of formally recording and recognizing de facto land rights and point out the risks of ignoring these rights, while acknowledging the complexity and difficulty of incorporating this understanding into the design of climate change mitigation projects...|$|R
40|$|The Constitution of South Africa {{guarantees}} {{the right of}} citizens to access to adequate housing and <b>land.</b> The Universal <b>Declaration</b> of Human Rights of 1948 also recognises the right to adequate housing as {{an important component of}} the right to an adequate standard of living. However, vast numbers of citizens have been unable to access adequate housing due to regulatory frameworks operating in the cities and towns that they live in. Using the case study research methodology, the study shows how an alternative approach to housing delivery can be implemented. The study looks at a community in iCwili Location which is in the Great Kei Local municipality which piloted the managed land settlement (MLS) approach to housing delivery. MLS seeks to promote an incremental approach to site, service and housing delivery. It emphasizes the need for the provision of planned, secure land with access to basic services as a first step towards housing delivery and settlement upgrading. The study documented the process involved in the implementation of the pilot project and how the community was involved with project. The findings revealed that the community appreciated being involved with each phase of the project and being part of the decision-making process. The respondents cited the delight they shared with having occupation rights to the land and they could finally be in position to be able to build their homes with no fear of eviction...|$|R
50|$|In {{the reign}} of Victoria there was a vast mass of {{legislation}} dealing with real estate in almost every conceivable aspect. At the immediate beginning of the reign stands the Wills Act 1837. The transfer of real estate was simplified by the Real Property Act of 1845 and by the Conveyancing Acts of 1881 and 1882. Additional powers of dealing with settled estates were given by the Settled Estates Act 1856, later by the Settled Estates Act 1877, and the Settled Land Act 1882. Succession duty was levied {{for the first time}} on freeholds in 1853. The strictness of the Mortmain Act was relaxed in favour of gifts and sales to public institutions of various kinds, such as schools, parks and museums. The period of limitation was shortened for most purposes from twenty to twelve years by the Real Property Limitation Act 1874. Several acts were passed dealing with the enfranchisement and commutation of copyholds and the preservation of commons and open spaces. The Naturalization Act 1870 enabled aliens to hold and transfer land in England. The Felony Act 1870, abolished forfeiture of real estate on conviction for felony. The Agricultural Holdings Acts 1883 and 1900, and other acts, gave the tenant of a tenancy within the acts a general right to compensation for improvements, substituted a year's notice to quit for the six months' notice previously necessary, enlarged the tenant's right to fixtures, and limited the amount of distress. By the Intestate Estates Act 1884 the law of escheat was extended to incorporeal hereditaments and equitable estates. Among other subjects which have been dealt with by legislation in the 19th century may be mentioned land transfer, registration, mortgage, partition, excambion, fixtures, taking of <b>land</b> in execution, <b>declaration</b> of title and apportionment.|$|R
