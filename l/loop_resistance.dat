Flow Loops are made of high strength stainless steels which are susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement. In combination with tensile loads, this may cause failure due to hydrogen induced stress cracking. Finite element simulations are made when investigating the risk of this type of failure. The analyses must follow recommended practice, issued by Det Norske Veritas, to be approved. Problems with these analyses are that the modelling of Flow Loops is time consuming and rather tedious. Also, the recommended practice has been difficult to interpret with the effect that different engineers perform the analyses in various ways. This project aims to solve these problems by creating a tool that automates the procedure of creating Flow Loop finite element models and from the obtained results evaluates the Flow <b>Loop’s</b> <b>resistance</b> against hydrogen induced stress cracking by following the recommended practice.

In patients with reduced GFR, ceiling dosages of loop diuretics are increased proportional to the decrease in GFR.

50|$|The {{ground loop}} will be {{carrying}} some current {{at the local}} supply frequency, typically 50 Hz or 60 Hz, due to electromagnetic induction from current-carrying conductors nearby. There is an AC magnetic field everywhere in developed areas; however, its magnitude and direction depend strongly on the local environment and arrangement of current-carrying wiring. This influences the current induced in the ground loop, which is also dependent on the area enclosed by the ground loop and its orientation. The impedance of the loop, basically just its resistance at low frequencies, also influences the induced current that will flow. It is important to realise that for a ground loop to cause problems, {{there must be a}} local magnetic field produced by power frequency or other systems. It is the combination of radiated field and receptive ground loop that causes problems, and the situation can be improved by attention to either one, or both of these. In effect, the ground loop is the secondary of a very loosely coupled transformer, the primary being the summation of all current carrying conductors nearby. Transformer action limits the induced voltage in the loop, and the weak coupling limits the maximum current that will flow, even if the <b>loop</b> <b>resistance</b> is very low. The maximum induced energy is normally quite small, and except in situations very close to a radiating loop carrying high current, there is no prospect of inducing sufficient energy to cause a hazard to humans.|$|E

The objective was to screen those thermocouples which would consecutively be used under irradiation. Two such screening tests have been performed with a set of thermocouples embedded in graphite (mainly conventional Type N thermocouples and thermocouples with innovative sheaths) in a dedicated furnace with helium flushing.

40|$|Abstract. Pulsating and {{explosive}} time {{profiles of}} mm-wave solar bursts observed at Metsähovi are examined {{in terms of}} the energy release in a single current-carrying loop. We suppose that the electric current in the loop is driven by photospheric convective flows. The flare occurs due to flute instability provoking the penetration of partially ionized plasma from the chromosphere or prominence into the current channel of a loop and increasing the <b>loop</b> <b>resistance</b> by many orders of magnitude. The feedback of deviation of the loop magnetic field on the energy release rate is taken into account. Joule plasma heating due to current dissipation and electron acceleration in DC electric field are considered. Both processes act simultaneously and are driven by one parameter, the penetration depth of partially ionized plasma into the current-carrying loop. Two regimes of energy release are studied: (i) Pulsating energy release in current-carrying loops with negative radial gradient of gas pressure; (ii) Explosive plus pulsating energy release in a loop with positive radial gradient of gas pressure. One can explain the various time behaviours of the flares, for example, several quasi-periodic pulses, and pulsations with increasing amplitude at pre-flash phase followed by explosive enhancement of the emission at flash phase. The possibility of powerful flare in current-carrying magnetic loop with plasma beta β ≪ 1 is discussed...|$|E

Also little is known about how these knots behave when exposed to physiological loading following repair. This study presents the development of a practical tool to allow surgeons to test the quality of their arthroscopic knots and allow them to make choices with regard to knot configuration and suture material. This study uses an apparatus to model the repair of a Bankart lesion. Ten examples of the Duncan loop and SMC knots were tied using PDS, Ethibond, Panacryl and Fibrewire. An arthroscopic knotting technique was used. Reverse slippage occurring during the tying process was recorded. Each knot was then left for 12 hours under loads equivalent to a Bankart repair and the subsequent reverse slippage was recorded.

40|$|Background: <b>Loop</b> {{diuretic}} <b>resistance</b> is {{a common}} barrier to effective decongestion in acute heart failure (AHF), and is associated with poor outcome. Specific mechanisms underlying diuretic resistance are currently unknown in contemporary AHF patients. We therefore aimed to determine {{the relative importance of}} defects in diuretic delivery vs. renal tubular response in determining diuretic response (DR) in AHF. Methods and results: Fifty AHF patients treated with intravenous bumetanide underwent a 6 -h timed urine collection for sodium and bumetanide clearance. Whole-kidney DR was defined as sodium excreted per doubling of administered loop diuretic and represents the sum of defects in drug delivery and renal tubular response. Tubular DR, defined as sodium excreted per doubling of renally cleared (urinary) <b>loop</b> diuretic, captures <b>resistance</b> specifically in the renal tubule. Median administered bumetanide dose was 3. 0 (2. 0 - 4. 0) mg with 52 (33 - 77) % of the drug excreted into the urine. Significant between-patient variability was present as the administered dose only explained 39 % of variability in the quantity of bumetanide in urine. Cumulatively, factors related to drug delivery such as renal bumetanide clearance, administered dose, and urea clearance explained 28 % of the variance in whole-kidney DR. However, resistance {{at the level of the}} renal tubule (tubular DR) explained 71 % of the variability in whole-kidney DR.
