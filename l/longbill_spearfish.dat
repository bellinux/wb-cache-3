25|$|The Formigas Bank is {{essentially}} a submarine volcano, inhabited by deep-dwelling marine species, coral and sponges. The cone is delimited approximately by the islets of the northwest and the Dollabarats reef to the southeast. In the ancient crater there is a rich community of species common to the Azores. Among the species typical of the area are wrasse (Mediterranean rainbow wrasse, ornate wrasse), damselfish, sergeant fish (yellow and black), grouper, Mediterranean parrotfish, and the emblematic Atlantic goliath grouper, Serranidae and barred hogfish. Alongside these are pelagic predators that also reside in the bank (African threadfish, <b>longbill</b> <b>spearfish)</b> and migratory species that travel between destinations (like the manta ray and whale shark).|$|E

50|$|The <b>longbill</b> <b>spearfish</b> (Tetrapturus pfluegeri) is {{a species}} of marlin native to the Atlantic Ocean where it is found above the {{thermocline}} in open waters. This species can reach a length of 254 cm FL and the maximum weight recorded is 58 kg. It feeds on pelagic fishes such as needlefish, tuna, and jack, as well as squids. They spawn once a year.|$|E

This {{classification}} places the {{species in the}} same genus as shortbill spearfish, mediterranean spearfish, roundscale spearfish, and <b>longbill</b> <b>spearfish.</b> Researchers have identified fossils from the genus Tetrapurus {{dating back to the}} Langhian Age 15 ma (million years ago). Extinct ancestors, such as species from the genus Palaeorhynchus date to as early as 56 ma.|$|E

40|$|The <b>longbill</b> <b>spearfish</b> (Tetrapturus pfluegeri; Istiophoridae) is an epipelagic {{billfish}} species broadly {{distributed in}} the Atlantic Ocean and exploited by multinational fisheries. No data exist on the population structure or genetic diversity of this apex predator, despite a strong need for this information to inform international conservation and management efforts. Thirteen microsatellite loci, comprising mostly tri- and tetra-nucleotide repeats, were isolated and characterized for this species by genotyping individuals (n = 29 – 42) obtained from western North and South Atlantic fisheries. The average number of alleles ranged from 3 to 16 and the expected heterozygosity ranged from 0. 35 to 0. 86. This suite of markers provides the first population genetic nuclear resources for the <b>longbill</b> <b>spearfish,</b> allowing initiation of studies for assessing the population structure and demography of this poorly understood species...|$|E
40|$|The <b>longbill</b> <b>spearfish</b> Tetrapturus pfleugeri Robins and de Sylva, 1963, {{is a small}} istiophorid {{billfish}} {{found in}} the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent seas that occurs as an infrequent by-catch in recreational and commercial pelagic fisheries. Although some data exist on diet and reproduction based on dead specimens, little is known of the species’ habitat preferences or individual movement patterns. In 2004, two <b>longbill</b> <b>spearfish</b> were tagged with pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) near Ascencion Island in the South Atlantic for 11 d and 45 d. Individual movement tracks derived from light-based geolocation estimates suggested little relationship with sea surface temperature fronts, although both animals demonstrated a clear preference away from the West African subsurface hypoxic plume. Overall temperature at depth distributions for both fish were narrow; between 22 – 26 °C for 97...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{validation}} of the roundscale spearfish (Tetrapturus georgii) within the western North Atlantic has introduced new complexities {{in the management of}} the overfished white marlin (Kajikia albida) in this region due to historical and contemporary misidentification between the two morphologically similar species. Compounding the management challenge for white marlin, which is currently assessed as a single Atlantic-wide stock, is an unclear picture of the extent of the roundscale spearfish 2 ̆ 7 s overall Atlantic distribution. By using genetic tools (mitochondrial DNA ND 4 L-ND 4 locus sequences) for species identification, we confirm that the roundscale spearfish has a much broader distribution than previously known, including the central North Atlantic and much of the western South Atlantic to at least 28 ° 52 ′S. This much wider Atlantic distribution of the roundscale spearfish sympatric with its morphologically similar congeners, the white marlin and <b>longbill</b> <b>spearfish</b> (Tetrapturus pfluegeri), raises further management complexities: it increases the geographic scale for species misidentification in catch records that form the basis for stock assessments and uncertainty in currently accepted white marlin biological parameters. Additional vigilance in obtaining accurate species identification by improved fishery onboard observer training and incorporation of genetic tools is recommended for informing management of white marlin, <b>longbill</b> <b>spearfish</b> and roundscale spearfish throughout the Atlantic...|$|E
40|$|The roundscale spearfish, Tetrapturus georgii Lowe, 1840, {{is known}} only from four {{specimens}} from the Mediterranean and eastern North Atlantic. Additional specimens {{have not been}} identified since 1961, making the validity and distribution of this species unclear. Analysis of 16 billfish specimens from the western North Atlantic {{on the basis of}} scale morphology, anus position, and mitochondrial DNA confirms the validity of this species and extends its distribution. Mid-lateral scales are soft, notably rounded anteriorly, and bear 2 – 3 points distinct from those of the sympatric <b>longbill</b> <b>spearfish</b> (Tetrapturus pfluegeri Robins and de Sylva, 1963) and white marlin (Tetrapturus albidus Poey, 1860). Position of anus relative to first anal fin and a related morphometric ratio (distance from anus to first anal fin origin: height of first anal fin) are intermediate between T. pfluegeri and T. albidus. These characteristics match those described by Robins (1974) from the four eastern North Atlantic specimens of T. georgii. The mitochondrial ND 4 L, ND 4, and cyt b gene sequences strongly support reciprocal monophyly of the western North Atlantic specimens relative to other Atlantic istiophorids. The difficulty in distinguishing between morphologically similar T. georgii and T. albidus in the field and the previously unrecognized presence of T. georgii in the western North Atlantic has implications for stock assessments of T. albidus, a species that is severely overfished...|$|E
