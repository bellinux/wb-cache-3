Pathology group, seizure type and age at surgery were compared against MRI and NeuN data. CD patients demonstrated increased MRI cerebral (3 %) and gray matter (8 %) volumes of the affected compared with non-affected cerebral hemisphere, and increased layer 1 (131 %), upper cortical (9 [...] 23 %) and white matter (28 [...] 77 %) NeuN densities compared with autopsy cases. Non-CD cases showed decreased cerebral volumes of the affected hemisphere (14 [...] 18 %) without changes in NeuN densities.

40|$|Abstract—In {{opportunistic}} channel access, {{the user}} {{needs to make}} real time decisions on when and which channel to access with uncertainty. Assuming perfect channel statistics, several studies have applied optimal stopping theory to derive control strat-egy for sequential sensing/probing based opportunistically access-ing (s-SPA), exploiting temporary opportunities among multiple channels. Meanwhile, numerous multi-arm bandit (MAB) -based approaches have been proposed for online learning of channel selection in periodical sensing/accessing system, however, these schemes fail to exploit the opportunistic diversity in short term. In this paper, we investigate online learning of optimal control in s-SPA systems, where both statistics learning and temporary opportunity utilization are jointly considered. An effective and ef-ficient online policy, so called IE-OSP, is proposed, which theoret-ically guarantees system converges to the optimal s-SPA strategy with bounded probability. Experimental results further show that, the regret of IE-OSP is almost in optimal <b>logarithmic</b> <b>increasing</b> rate over time, and is sub-linear with {{the increasing number of}} channels.

The virulent clone remained in the phase of <b>logarithmic</b> <b>increase</b> longer, reached plateau levels 10 -fold higher and took longer to reduce to low levels than the attenuated clone. Pyrexia (more severe and prolonged for clone 7 a) and inflammatory response (similar for both clones, consisting of 90 % polymorphonuclear (PMN) and 10 % mononuclear (MN) phagocytes) occurred {{at about the same}} time (25 - 29 h after inoculation) for both clones. However, the onset of the period of rapid decline of clone 64 d in the nasal washes occurred 4 - 8 h before that for 7 a in 11 of 16 ferrets. Furthermore, significant correlations were found between increases in temperature and numbers of inflammatory cells and subsequent reductions in virus titres in nasal washes; and the delay between the responses and subsequent correlated reductions of virus was less for clone 64 d than for clone 7 a.

Early events, including virus entry into cells, were analyzed by measuring the amounts of newly synthesized viral DNA 14 to 16 h after infection of macrophages by using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. SIVmac 239 ws found to enter macrophages with an efficiency {{similar to that of}} the macrophage-tropic derivatives. The assay indeed measured newly synthesized viral DNA since detection was inhibited by the reverse transcriptase inhibitors azidothymidine and foscarnet and by heat inactivation of the virus stock prior to infection. Furthermore, entry of SIVmac 239 and macrophage-tropic variant into macrophages was inhibited by monoclonal antibody against CD 4. Analysis of the time course of viral DNA accumulation showed that although initial entry of SIVmac 239 into cells occurred normally, subsequent <b>logarithmic</b> <b>increases</b> in the amounts of viral DNA associated with spread of virus through the macrophage cultures was blocked. Increasing the amount of SIVmac 239 incubated with macrophages increased the amount of virus entering the cell, but this could not overcome the block to replication.

The participants completed questionnaires on work climate, work burnout and depression at seven time points across two years. Parallel process latent growth modeling was used to analyze the associations of change between work climate and burnout and depression. Work climate displayed a logarithmic decreasing trend while burnout and depression displayed <b>logarithmic</b> <b>increasing</b> trends over two years. Baseline levels of work climate were negatively and moderately associated with baseline levels of burnout and depression (r = −. 44 to −. 60, p <. 01).

Allocation of assimilated materials varied with a change in temperature, reflecting the different temperature dependence between physiological processes.

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{establish}} the optimal flash settings for retinal vessel oxygen saturation parameters using dual-wavelength imaging in a multiethnic group. METHODS. Twelve healthy young subjects (mean age 32 years [SD 7]; three Mediterranean, two South Asian, and seven Caucasian individuals) underwent retinal vessel oxygen saturation measurements using dual-wavelength oximetry, noncontact tonometry, and manual sphygmomanometry. In order {{to evaluate the}} impact of flash intensity, we obtained three images (fundus camera angle 30 °, ONH centered) per flash setting. Flash settings of the fundus camera were increased in steps of 2 (initial setting of 6 and the final of 22), which reflect <b>logarithmic</b> <b>increasing</b> intensities from 13. 5 to 214 Watt seconds (Ws). RESULTS. Flash settings below 27 Ws were too low to obtain saturation measurements, whereas flash settings of more than 214 Ws resulted in overexposed images. Retinal arteriolar and venular oxygen saturation was comparable at flash settings of 27 to 76 Ws (arterioles' range: 85 %- 92 %; venules' range: 45 %- 53 %). Higher flash settings lead to increased saturation measurements in both retinal arterioles (up to 110 %) and venules (up to 92 %), with a more pronounced increase in venules. CONCLUSIONS. Flash intensity has {{a significant impact on}} retinal vessel oxygen saturation measurements using dual-wavelength retinal oximetry. High flash intensities lead to supranormal oxygen saturation measurements with a magnified effect in retinal venules compared with arteries. In addition to even retinal illumination, the correct flash setting is of paramount importance for clinical acquisition of images in retinal oximetry.
