50|$|Escape and radiate {{coevolution}} produces {{much more}} biological variation than other evolutionary mechanisms. For instance, cospeciation {{is important for}} diversity amongst species that share a symbiotic relationship, however this does not create nearly as much diversity in comparison to reciprocal evolutionary change due to natural selection.Evidence of rapid diversification following a novel adaptation is shown through the evolution of resin and <b>latex</b> <b>canal</b> tubes in 16 different lineages of plants. Plants with resin or latex canals can easily defend themselves against insect herbivores. When lineages of canal bearing plants are compared to the lineages of canal free plants, {{it is apparent that}} canal bearing plants are far more diverse, supporting escape and radiate coevolution.|$|E
40|$|Euphorbia prostrata Ait. (Euphorbiaceae) is a small, prostrate, annual green herb {{sometime}} purple tint in colour. It {{is widely}} distributed globally {{and used as}} antihemorrhoidal, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, hypolipidemic, antidiabetic, antidirroheal, antiasthmatic and for various skin diseases. The microscopy of root shows the presence of obliterated cork cells, phelloderm, cortex, endodermis, phloem, medulary rays and xylem; the stem shows the presence of multicellular trichome, cuticle, epidermis, cortex, endodermis, pericycle, phloem, <b>latex</b> <b>canal,</b> xylem and pith; the leave reveal the presence of multicellular, multiseriate glandular hairs, epidermis, vascular bundles, stomata anomocytic and anisocytic. The vein islet number and vein termination number have also been determined. The powder study reveals the presence of epidermal cells, trichomes, parenchymatous cells, pollen grains, vessels, fibers and stomata. The water soluble, alcohol soluble and petroleum ether extractive values were determined. The total ash, water soluble ash, acid insoluble ash and sulphated ash were also observed. Preliminar...|$|E
25|$|Tumble thistles are {{assigned}} to the Cichorieae-tribe that shares anastomosing <b>latex</b> <b>canals</b> in both root, stem and leaves, and has flower heads only consisting of one type of floret. In Warionia and Gundelia these are exclusively disk florets, while all other Cichorieae only have ligulate florets. Gundelia is unique in the complex morphology of the inflorescences.|$|R
50|$|Golden thistles are {{assigned}} to the Cichorieae tribe that shares anastomosing <b>latex</b> <b>canals</b> in both root, stem and leaves, and has flower heads only consisting of one type of floret. In Scolymus these are ligulate florets, common to the group except for Warionia and Gundelia, which only have disk florets.A unique character setting Scolymus apart from the other Cichorieae are the dorsally compressed cypsellas which are surrounded by scales (or paleae).|$|R
50|$|Most {{species are}} herbaceous, perennial, {{short-lived}} or annual plants, rarely subshrubs, shrubs or vines. All Cichorieae-species have <b>latex</b> <b>canals</b> {{in both the}} roots, stems and leaves, and this occurs to be a unique character among the Asteraceae, although latex as such occurs rather widespread in this family. The leaves are in a rosette or alternately set along the stem, {{but this is the}} dominant situation in the Asteraceae. The only exception in the Cichorieae are the opposite lower leaves of Shinnersoseris. Traditionally, the Cichorieae consisted of taxa with flowerheads only containing bisexual ligulate florets (having a strap-shaped corolla with five teeth at its tip), a rare character that is further present only in the genera Catamixis, Glossarion, Hyaloseris (Mutisieae), and Fitchia (Heliantheae). However, recently the genera Gundelia and Warionia have been included in the Cichorieae, and those two genera have heads containing only disk flowers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Latex</b> and resin <b>canals</b> {{in plants}} {{are used to}} deter predators by {{releasing}} a sticky secretion when punctured which can immobilise insects and some contain toxic or foul tasting substances. They have evolved independently approximately 40 times and are considered a key innovation. By increasing the plant's resistance to predation the canals increase the species fitness {{and allow them to}} escape being eaten, at least until the predator evolves an ability to overcome the defence. During the period of resistance the plants are less likely to become extinct and can diversify and speciate, and as such taxa with <b>latex</b> and resin <b>canals</b> are more diverse than their canal lacking sister taxa.|$|R
40|$|Balan Menon, P. K. : Taxonomic {{value of}} wood anatomy seen through Malayan woods. The Malayan Forester 24 (1961) 290 - 301. Mr Menon, {{who is a}} wood {{technologist}} at the Forest Research Institute, Kepong, Malaya, presented this paper at the Hawaii Congress. In it, he gives a series of classifications of Malayan woods {{on the basis of}} anatomical features which can be seen by a hand-lens, he distinguishes 18 classes, notably woods with: ring-porous structure, exclusively solitary pores, multiple vessel-perforation, vestured (vessel) pits, scalariform intervessel pits, ripple marks, broad rays, uniseriate rays, septate fibres, distinctly bordered fibre pits, tanniferous tribes, <b>latex</b> tribes, horizontal <b>canals,</b> vertical canals, included phloem, mucilage or oil cells, silica inclusion, raphides...|$|R
5000|$|Some herbivores use feeding {{behaviors}} {{that are capable of}} disarming the defenses of their host plants. One such plant defensive strategy is the use of <b>latex</b> and resin <b>canals</b> that contain sticky toxins and digestibility reducers. These canal systems store fluids under pressure, and when ruptured (i.e. from herbivory) secondary metabolic products flow to the release point. [...] Herbivores can evade this defense, however, by damaging the leaf veins. This technique minimizes the outflow of latex or resin beyond the cut and allows herbivores to freely feed above the damaged section. Several strategies are employed by herbivores to relieve canal pressure, including vein cutting and trenching. The technique used by the herbivore corresponds to the architecture of the canal system. Dussourd and Denno examined the behavior of 33 species of insect herbivores on 10 families of plants with canals and found that herbivores on plants with branching canal systems used vein cutting, while herbivores found on plants with net-like canal systems employed trenching to evade plant defenses.|$|R
