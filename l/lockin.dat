40|$|Spatial lock-ins may {{hinder the}} {{physical}} environment from adapting to new conditions and thereby risk to inhibit necessary change in society and reproduce current structures. This process reinforces uneven geographic development and urban interpretive prerogative. The study aims to strengthen the ability of planning practice to open spatial lock-ins caused by urbanisation and to confront challenges generated by uneven geographic development. Focus is set on how planning practice can establish and activate relevant local-regional contexts for specific planning situations, and clarify and enable combinations of resources that are made invisible when economic growth dominates planning objectives. The research is conducted through a design-based research process where participation in planning practices has enabled an active interplay between practice and theory. Through architectural thinking, spatial alternatives have been modelled to test theoretical argumentation, and has made visible and problematized spatial situations and their structural conditions. The research has been developed and made operative through the work in two empirical contexts: In-depth comprehensive plan Mariestad – Tidanpromenaden and Structural image Skaraborg as research tools. The study develops a theoretical and methodological framework constituted by three interacting conceptual tools. The first conceptual tool, fragile urban landscapes clarifies how spatial lock-ins cause fragile social, political, economic and ecological processes. It makes visible how the interplay between spatial conditions and structural transformations create lock-ins as combinations of scarcity of resources, competence, decision mandate and rigidity in current spatial structures and planning organisation. The second conceptual tool, urban ecologies, makes visible the urban landscape as layered complex productive material and discursive configurations. Urban ecologies can thereby {{be used as a}} tool to reveal how topographies, infrastructures and resources both enable and constrain transformation and change in society. The third conceptual tool, urban key projects, relates to situation-oriented interventions that combine resources from different urban ecologies in order to trigger local-regional transformation. The research demonstrates how the three conceptual tools together can support planning practice to implement material and discursive changes in order to break reproduction of spatial lock-ins and support re-negotiations of the urban landscape. This implies a process of reading and mapping material and discursive compositions, re-valuing and combining resources and potential related to the planning situation, problematizing ongoing transformation processes, formulating alternative directions of development and an incremental, coupled and long-term implementation. Hereby the developed theoretical and methodological framework can be used to open spatial <b>lockins</b> and expand local-regional acting space for planning practice...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Conventional {{shearography}} and Electronic-Speckle-Pattern-Interferometry (ESPI) {{are being}} used for remote deformation measurements. However, for non-destructive testing, only {{the changes in the}} deformation field are of interest that are caused by hidden defects. By applying the basic idea of <b>lockin</b> thermography to interferometry, small local discontinuities can be monitored even on a large background deformation. This is achieved by evaluating the whole image stack with respect to the local response to the coded thermal excitation so that the relevant information contained in the image stack is compressed to an amplitude- and a phase angle image. As only defects contribute to a signal change in the phase image, the method is defect selective. Furthermore, besides the advantage of a substantial improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio, <b>lockin</b> interferometry allows also for depth profiling. 1...|$|E
40|$|Objective {{to study}} the {{procedure}} of exiting the contract its costs and benefits. 	Methods statistical method comparative analysis. 	Results free exit from contract {{is one of the}} most powerful tools for the consumer rights protection. The procedure frees consumers from bad deals and keeps businesses honest. Yet consumers often choose transactions with <b>lockin</b> provisions trading off exit rights for other perks. This article examines the costs and benefits of free exit as compared to the <b>lockin</b> alternative. According to the authors the present regulation of exit penalties in the USA is poorly tailored to address concerns about <b>lockin</b> particularly in light of increasingly ubiquitous marketbased solutions. The article also calls regulatory attention to loyalty rewards which are shown to be as powerful as exit penalties and equally detrimental. 	Scientific novelty the article reveals a paradoxical state of the law exit regulations in the USA are used most where they are needed least. Termination penalties present an obvishyous target for regulatory intervention while loyalty programs seem benign not warranting any regulatory attention.
