A <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> technique is that posterior valve tissue is translucent and can be pushed {{against the wall of}} the urethra by inflowing irrigation fluid, making it difficult to visualize.|$|E
25|$|Willard Gardner and Walter Gardner {{developed}} a negative head permeameter {{as early as}} 1939. Dixon (1975) {{developed a}} closed-top ring infiltrometer to quantify macropores. Water is applied to a closed-top system, which permits the imposition of negative head or pressure on the ponded water surface. Negative tension {{can be considered as}} simulating a positive soil air pressure, created by a negative air pressure above ponded surface water. A simplification was made by Topp and Zebchuk (1985). The <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> device is the infiltration has to be started by ponding the closed-top infiltrometer (applying a positive head), then adjusted to a negative pressure. Little research effort was continued in this area, instead attention has been given mainly to the sorptivity apparatus of Dirksen (1975) which used a ceramic plate as a base. Based on this design, Brent Clothier and Ian White (1981) developed the sorptivity tube which can provide a constant negative potential (tension) on the soil surface. However, the sorptivity tube had many shortcomings, hence modifications to the design {{led to the development of}} the disc permeameter by Perroux and White (1988) from CSIRO. In the US it is known as the tension infiltrometer.|$|E
500|$|The {{capacitive}} gap structure {{consists of}} sections of line about λ/2 in length which act as resonators and are coupled [...] "end-on" [...] by {{gaps in the}} transmission line. It is particularly suitable for planar formats, is easily implemented with printed circuit technology and {{has the advantage of}} taking up no more space than a plain transmission line would. The <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> topology is that performance (particularly insertion loss) deteriorates with increasing fractional bandwidth, and acceptable results are not obtained with a Q less than about 5. A further difficulty with producing low-Q designs is that the gap width is required to be smaller for wider fractional bandwidths. The minimum width of gaps, like the minimum width of tracks, is limited by the resolution of the printing technology.|$|E

2500|$|Pyrosequencing {{has also}} been used to analyze bisulfite-treated DNA without using methylation-specific PCR.

2500|$|The first really {{popular and}} commercially {{successful}} design was French. An example {{is at the}} Museum of Science and Technology, Ottawa. Initially developed around 1863, it sparked a fashionable craze briefly during 1868-70. Its design was simpler than the Macmillan bicycle; it used rotary cranks and pedals mounted to the front wheel hub. Pedaling {{made it easier for}} riders to propel the machine at speed, but the rotational speed <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> design created stability and comfort concerns which would lead to the large front wheel of the [...] "penny farthing". It was difficult to pedal the wheel that was used for steering. The use of metal frames reduced the weight and provided sleeker, more elegant designs, and also allowed mass-production. [...] Different braking mechanisms were used depending on the manufacturer. In England, the velocipede earned the name of [...] "bone-shaker" [...] because of its rigid frame and iron-banded wheels that resulted in a [...] "bone-shaking experience for riders." ...|$|E
