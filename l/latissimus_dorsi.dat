5|$|The shape, size, {{insertion}} and {{origin of}} the arch can vary widely. The arch usually occurs {{on both sides of}} the body; but may also occur only on one side. The muscular component of the arch varies, with some arches seen to be purely fibrous. The origin can be a direct continuation of the <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi</b> muscle fibres, originate with the tendinous element of the <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi,</b> or be a mixture of the two types originating from both the muscle and the tendon.|$|E
5|$|Possible {{homologous}} {{structures in}} other {{species have been}} identified as the dorsoepitrochlearis muscle, the pectoralis quartus muscle or the panniculus carnosus. The dorsoepitrochlearis is an important climbing muscle in monkeys and apes where it has its origin in the tendinous region of the <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi</b> and extends down the arm as a superficial muscle.|$|E
5|$|In December 2005, Kennedy {{participated in}} WWE's {{overseas}} tour. On {{the second day}} in Italy, Kennedy suffered a serious <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi</b> tear. Even after surgery in December, Kennedy was still {{forced out of the}} ring for nearly six months while he rehabilitated the legitimate injury. He continued to make appearances on SmackDown! and Velocity throughout January and February and even made an appearance on the January 11 episode of WWE Byte This! with Todd Grisham to maintain visibility.|$|E
5|$|On August 18, 2007, Anderson gave an {{interview}} in which he admitted to using steroids when he was performing on the independent wrestling scene, stating that he had quit using them in November 2005 to comply with WWE's Talent Wellness Program, implying that his job in the promotion was worth more than extra muscle mass. 12 days later, on August 30, his statements were shown to be incorrect when he, along with nine other WWE wrestlers, were named in a Sports Illustrated article as having received performance-enhancing drugs in direct non-compliance with the WWE Talent Wellness Program. Anderson received anastrozole, somatropin, and testosterone between October 2006 and February 2007. He later claimed that the steroids were for a legitimate medical reason, {{saying that they were}} from when he tore his <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi</b> muscle in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Cabaniss {{was killed}} in an {{accident}} on board the Swatara on January 19, 1882. An official report of the incident was released on March 25 of that year. According to the report, before-noon exercises on board the ship had just been completed when an order was made to prepare rifles for target practice. At around ten in the morning, Cabaniss was assisting in the instruction of the ship's second group of sailors when he broke off and entered the ship's engine room to instruct a sailor on his duties. An experienced sailor, Ensign James P. Parker, was explaining to new sailors how to properly load their guns. He showed them how to load and discharge the weapons using a practice round. He then reloaded his gun with live rounds, but apparently forgot this and fired one of them. The bullet ricocheted off the ship's deck, struck one of the guns, ricocheted off the deck again, and struck Cabaniss, killing him instantly. The ball first entered through his left arm, impacting it so strongly that it broke every bone in his elbow. It then entered his side, tearing his <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi</b> muscle; went into his chest, severing every major artery; ricocheted up to near his shoulder, exited his right side, and struck the man he was instructing in the shoulder. Cabaniss was reported to have never made a sound as he fell. The other sailor recovered.|$|E
25|$|The {{inferior}} {{angle of}} the scapula is the lowest part of the scapula and is covered by the <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi</b> muscle. It moves forwards round the chest when the arm is abducted. The inferior angle is formed by the union of the medial and lateral borders of the scapula. It is thick and rough and its posterior or back surface affords attachment to the teres major and often to a few fibers of the <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi.</b> The anatomical plane that passes vertically through the inferior angle is named the scapular line.|$|E
25|$|Its {{lower third}} {{presents}} a broader, somewhat triangular surface, the Inferior {{angle of the}} scapula, which gives origin to the Teres major, and over which the <b>Latissimus</b> <b>dorsi</b> glides; frequently the latter muscle takes origin by a few fibers from this part.|$|E
25|$|Spasticity, if present, {{can be very}} important. It is not a {{contraindication}} per se, but severe spasticity must {{be treated}} first depending in which muscle groups it is present. Spascticity can be treated with botox or myotomies. In some cases spastic tone can be useful to facilitate hand grasp and grip. Harmful spasticity that does not respond to medication or surgical treatment is a contraindication. The shoulder muscles, pectoralis major and <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi,</b> must be evaluated. The shoulder must not only have good motor condition but also good proprioceptive control. The trophicity and articular condition of the upper limb must also be considered. A poor condition requires a preoperative rehabilitation program.|$|E
25|$|A golf stroke uses muscles on core (especially {{erector spinae}} muscles and <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi</b> muscle when turning), hamstring, shoulder, and wrist. Stronger muscles on wrist can prevent wrists from being twisted at swings, while {{stronger}} shoulders increase the turning force. Weak wrists can also deliver the impacts to elbows and even neck {{and lead to}} injury of them. (When a muscle contracts, it pulls equally from both ends and, to have movement at only {{one end of the}} muscle, other muscles must come into play to stabilize the bone to which {{the other end of the}} muscle is attached.) Golf is a unilateral exercise that can break body balances, requiring exercises to keep the balance in muscles.|$|E
25|$|In women, {{the breasts}} overlay the pectoralis major muscles and usually extend from {{the level of}} the second rib to {{the level of the}} sixth rib in the front of the human rib cage; thus, the breasts cover much of the chest area and the chest walls. At the front of the chest, the breast tissue can extend from the {{clavicle}} (collarbone) to the middle of the sternum (breastbone). At the sides of the chest, the breast tissue can extend into the axilla (armpit), and can reach as far to the back as the <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi</b> muscle, extending from the lower back to the humerus bone (the longest bone of the upper arm). As a mammary gland, the breast is composed of differing layers of tissue, predominantly two types: adipose tissue; and glandular tissue, which affects the lactation functions of the breasts.|$|E
25|$|Free-flap breast {{reconstruction}} {{is a type}} of autologous-tissue breast reconstruction applied after mastectomy {{for breast}} cancer, without the emplacement of a breast implant prosthesis. As a type of plastic surgery, the free-flap procedure for breast reconstruction employs tissues, harvested from another part of the woman’s body, to create a vascularised flap, which is equipped with its own blood vessels. Breast-reconstruction mammoplasty can sometimes be realised with the application of a pedicled flap of tissue that has been harvested from the <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi</b> muscle, which is the broadest muscle of the back, to which the pedicle (“foot”) of the tissue flap remains attached until it successfully grafts to the recipient site, the mastectomy wound. Moreover, if the volume of breast-tissue excised was of relatively small mass, breast augmentation procedures, such as autologous-fat grafting, also can be applied to reconstruct the breast lost to mastectomy.|$|E
25|$|Kapler gave fans a {{taste of}} his hard-nosed style against the Dodgers on August 16. He ran full-speed after Russell Martin's long fly in the seventh inning, {{snagging}} the ball to deprive Martin of a home run as he toppled head-first into the left-field seats. The outstanding catch helped the Brewers hold onto a one-run lead, and earned Kapler the Play of the Year Award, voted by over 12million fans in major league baseball's This Year in Baseball Awards. Similarly, three days later Kapler made a diving catch in left field to rob Ty Wigginton of a hit, and on September 6 Kapler ran down a blooper to center and made an outstanding diving catch. Kapler missed {{the last two weeks}} of the season as well as the NLDS after tearing his <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi</b> muscle in his right shoulder on a throw to the plate in mid-September.|$|E
500|$|The {{axillary}} arch (...) is {{a variant}} of the <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi</b> muscle in humans. It is found as a slip of muscle or fascia extending between the <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi</b> muscle and the pectoralis major. There is considerable variation in the exact position of its origin and insertions as well as its blood and nerve supply. Its presence in different ethnic groups varies, being present in about 7% of Europeans and with higher rates in the Chinese and less common in the Turkish population. The arch may occur on one or both sides of the body.|$|E
500|$|The {{axillary}} arch is an arch-shaped anatomical {{variant of}} the <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi</b> muscle of the human back. Its shape varies, but its defining characteristics are its origin from the <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi</b> muscle, its insertion close to or on the upper [...] part of the humerus, and that it crosses the neurovascular bundle associated with the axillary nerve from dorsomedial to ventrolateral. Its size may vary from [...] in length and [...] in width. The axillary arch may be seen when the arm is abducted and the palms put {{on the back of}} the head. An impression can be seen on the medial side of the axilla.|$|E
500|$|Gophers are {{burrowing}} rodents of {{the family}} Geomyidae, characterized by fur-lined, external cheek pouches used to gather and transport food. The cheek pouches of geomyids such as the camas pocket gopher are controlled {{by a set of}} muscles, with a sphincter controlling the opening and closing of the pouch. A pair of muscles attached to the premaxilla pull the pouches forward, and paired retractor muscles pull the pouches back. These retractor muscles extend back and up from the cheek surfaces, forming a band [...] long and about [...] wide attached to aponeurosis of the <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi</b> muscle.|$|E
500|$|A chest tube (or {{intercostal}} drain) is {{the most}} definitive initial treatment of a pneumothorax. These are typically inserted in an area under the axilla (armpit) called the [...] "safe triangle", where damage to internal organs can be avoided; this is delineated by a horizontal line {{at the level of}} the nipple and two muscles of the chest wall (<b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi</b> and pectoralis major). Local anesthetic is applied. Two types of tubes may be used. In spontaneous pneumothorax, small-bore (smaller than 14F, 4.7mm diameter) tubes may be inserted by the Seldinger technique, and larger tubes do not have an advantage. In traumatic pneumothorax, larger tubes (28F, 9.3mm) are used.|$|E
500|$|The <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi</b> muscle of the {{springbok}} comprises 1.1–1.3% ash, 1.3–3.5% fat, 72–75% {{moisture and}} 18–22% protein. Stearic acid {{is the main}} fatty acid, accounting for 24–27% of the fatty acids. The cholesterol content varies from [...] per [...] of meat. The pH of the meat increases if the springbok is under stress or cropping is done improperly; consequently, the quality deteriorates and the colour darkens. The meat might be adversely affected if the animal is killed by shooting. The meat may be consumed raw or used in prepared dishes. Biltong can be prepared by preserving the raw meat with vinegar, spices, and table salt, without fermentation, followed by drying. Springbok meat may also be used in preparing salami; a {{study found that the}} flavour of this salami is better than mutton salami, and feels oilier than salami of beef, horse meat, or mutton.|$|E
2500|$|The {{inferior}} {{parts of}} <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi,</b> {{one of the}} muscles of the upper limb, arises from the posterior third of the iliac crest. Its action on the shoulder joint are internal rotation, adduction, and retroversion. [...] It also contributes to respiration (i.e. coughing). [...] When the arm is adducted, <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi</b> can pull it backward and medially until the back of the hand covers the buttocks.|$|E
2500|$|The armpit (...) {{is formed}} by {{the space between the}} muscles of the shoulder. The nerves and blood vessels of the arm travel through the armpit, and it {{possesses}} several sets of lymph nodes that are able to be examined. The armpit is {{formed by the}} pectoralis major and minor muscles at the front, the <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi</b> and teres major muscles at the back, the serratus anterior muscle on its inner surface, and the intertubercular groove of the humerus on the outer side.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, Frank Sanders and Kenneth Carpenter {{published}} a study concluding that Robinson's model had been correct. Frey & Riess {{would have been}} mistaken in their assertion that the shoulder and pelvic plates had no muscles attached to their upper sides. While these muscle groups were probably not very powerful, this {{could easily have been}} compensated by the large muscles on the back, especially the Musculus <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi,</b> which would have been well developed in view of the high spines on the backbone. Furthermore, the flat build of the shoulder and hip joints strongly indicated that the main movement was vertical, not horizontal.|$|E
2500|$|On May 29, Halladay {{was placed}} on the 15-day {{disabled}} list with a shoulder strain. It was his first DL stint since 2009. In a press conference on June 6, Halladay stated, [...] "Ultimately, my goal is to finish my career with the Phillies and win a World Series here. Some of those things are not fully in my control, but my intent is to play here and finish my career here and be here as long as I can." [...] Halladay stated this during his press conference about his shoulder injury, which he revealed that he will sit out three more weeks, and then re-evaluate his condition. The injury would eventually be diagnosed as a strained <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi</b> and Halladay was hopeful {{he would be able to}} return shortly after the All-Star break in July.|$|E
2500|$|The exact {{etiology}} of subluxation in post-stroke patients is unclear but {{appears to be}} caused by weakness of the musculature supporting the shoulder joint. [...] The shoulder {{is one of the most}} mobile joints in the body. [...] To provide a high level of mobility the shoulder sacrifices ligamentous stability and as a result relies on the surrounding musculature (i.e., rotator cuff muscles, <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi,</b> and deltoid) for much of its support. [...] This is in contrast to other less mobile joints such as the knee and hip, which have a significant amount of support from the joint capsule and surrounding ligaments. [...] If a stroke damages the upper motor neurons controlling muscles of the upper limb, weakness and paralysis, followed by spasticity occurs in a somewhat predictable pattern. [...] The muscles supporting the shoulder joint, particularly the supraspinatus and posterior deltoid become flaccid and can no longer offer adequate support leading to a downward and outward movement of arm at the shoulder joint causing tension on the relatively weak joint capsule. [...] Other factors have also been cited as contributing to subluxation such as pulling on the hemiplegic arm and improper positioning.|$|E
50|$|Using a pronated grip during pull-downs {{tends to}} result in the {{greatest}} activation of the <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi,</b> with no difference in <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi</b> activity between grip widths.|$|E
5000|$|Tight <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi</b> {{has been}} shown to be one cause of chronic {{shoulder}} pain and chronic back pain. [...] Because the <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi</b> connects the spine to the humerus, tightness in this muscle can manifest as either sub-optimal glenohumeral joint (shoulder) function which leads to chronic pain or tendinitis in the tendinous fasciae connecting the <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi</b> to the thoracic and lumbar spine.|$|E
50|$|The spine is {{extended}} working the spinal extensors and rectus abdominis (eccentrically), but ideally not the <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi.</b> The rectus abdominis is simultaneously lengthened in this action, {{along with the}} external obliques and <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Latissimus</b> <b>Dorsi</b> Tendon Transfers involve {{cutting the}} <b>Latissimus</b> <b>Dorsi</b> in half {{horizontally}} {{in order to}} 'pull' part of the muscle around and attach it {{to the outside of}} the biceps. This procedure provides external rotation with varying degrees of success. A side effect may be increased sensitivity of the part of the biceps where the muscle will now lie, since the <b>Latissimus</b> <b>Dorsi</b> has roughly twice the number of nerve endings per square inch of other muscles.|$|E
50|$|It {{follows the}} course of the subscapular artery, along the {{posterior}} wall of the axilla to the <b>Latissimus</b> <b>dorsi,</b> in which it may be traced as far as the lower border of the muscle. It supplies <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi</b> on its deep surface.|$|E
50|$|Pull-ups {{primarily}} {{target the}} <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi</b> is a {{potential}} source of muscle for breast reconstruction surgery after mastectomy (e.g. Mannu flap) [...] or to correct pectoral hypoplastic defects such as Poland's syndrome. [...] An absent or hypoplastic <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi</b> {{can be one of}} the associated symptoms of Poland's syndrome.|$|E
5000|$|The {{role of the}} latimus dorsi is subtle, as [...] "tight <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi</b> {{can pull}} the spine into {{too much of a}} lumbar curve". Further, [...] "if the <b>latissimus</b> <b>dorsi</b> are used to do the spinal {{extension}} , they will interfere with the lifting and lateral rotation of the arms".|$|E
