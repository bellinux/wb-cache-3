5|$|Network {{synthesis}} filters. The mathematical {{bases of}} network synthesis were {{laid in the}} 1930s and 1940s. After the end of World War II network synthesis became the primary tool of filter design. Network synthesis put filter design on a firm mathematical foundation, freeing it from the mathematically sloppy techniques of image design and severing the connection with physical lines. The essence of network synthesis is that it produces a design that will (at <b>least</b> <b>if</b> implemented with ideal components) accurately reproduce the response originally specified in black box terms.|$|E

The middle chainring, {{in the case of}} a triple crankset, usually has the most shaping to aid in shifting up and down.

25|$|Many results {{valid for}} {{function}} fields also hold, at <b>least</b> <b>if</b> reformulated properly, for number fields. However, {{the study of}} number fields often poses difficulties and phenomena not encountered in function fields. For example, in function fields, there is no dichotomy into non-archimedean and archimedean places. Nonetheless, function fields often serves {{as a source of}} intuition what should be expected in the number field case.|$|E

In this method, a mathematical function was fit to best approximate a series of observations where the sum of squares of its residuals (deviations from the raw data) was <b>least.</b> <b>If</b> there was systematic irregularity in the reliability of the data, the residuals were weighted accordingly.|$|E

However, if a ball leaves the diamond and bounces back before felling pins the frame must be reset.|$|E
25|$|The {{second most}} {{important}} festivity in the Swedish calendar, or perhaps for many the most important, is Midsummer, midsommar. Midsummer's Eve is celebrated {{on the eve of}} the Friday between the 20 and 26 June. Most Swedes try upon this day to get to a place in the countryside where they can eat pickled herring, boiled potatoes and sour cream as well as strawberries and brännvin. A maypole is often erected around which, at <b>least</b> <b>if</b> there are children present at the celebration, dancing is performed. Houses are often decorated in birch twigs.|$|E

25|$|The name Småland ("small lands") {{comes from}} the fact that it was a {{combination}} of several independent lands, Kinda (today a part of Östergötland), Tveta, Vista, Vedbo, Tjust, Sevede, Aspeland, Handbörd, Möre, Värend, Finnveden and Njudung. Every small land had its own law in the Viking age and early middle age and could declare themselves neutral in wars Sweden was involved in, at <b>least</b> <b>if</b> the King had no army present at the parliamentary debate. Around 1350, in the reign of king Magnus Eriksson, the first national law code was introduced in Sweden, and the historic provinces lost much of their old autonomy.|$|E
25|$|The living {{quarters}} of a castle with a bergfried are separate, often in a lower tower or an adjacent building called a palas (an English-style keep combines both functions of habitation and defence.) Consequently, a bergfried could be built as a tall slender tower with little internal room, few vaults and few if any windows. The bergfried served as a watchtower and as a refuge during sieges (at <b>least</b> <b>if</b> the siege was relatively brief). The distinction between a bergfried and a keep is not always clear-cut, as {{there were thousands of}} such towers built with many variations. There are some French keeps with only austere {{living quarters}}, while some late bergfrieds in Germany were intended to be habitable (Piper 1900).|$|E
25|$|A bus {{rapid transit}} (BRT) system using {{dedicated}} lanes can have a theoretical capacity of 3,600 passengers per hour per direction (30 buses per direction, 120 passengers in articulated buses). BRT is an alternative to LRT, at <b>least</b> <b>if</b> very high capacity is not needed. Using buses, roads can achieve a much higher commuter capacity than is achievable with passenger cars. To have 30 buses per direction an hour, buses must have priority at traffic lights and have their own dedicated lanes. Buses can travel closer to each other than rail vehicles because of better braking capability. However, each bus vehicle requires a single driver, whereas a light rail train may have three to four cars of much larger capacity in one train {{under the control of}} one driver, or no driver at all in fully automated systems, increasing the labor costs of high-traffic BRT systems compared to LRT systems.|$|E

25|$|The {{music of}} the Mass is {{typically}} performed by a choir. The Ordinary is theoretically designated for the whole congregation, whereas the Propers are proper to the choir of clerics in attendance. In practice, even the Ordinary is often too complicated for the congregation, and the choir is often made up of specially trained lay men and women (though in churches run by religious orders it is often made up of their members.) The choir, at <b>least</b> <b>if</b> clerical, was traditionally placed close to the altar in stalls. However, {{with the appearance of}} elaborate musical settings of the Ordinary of the Mass it became necessary to employ lay singers, and with this innovation, the choir moved first {{from the front of the}} church up to galleries on the sides of the church and then finally to a loft in the back. This in turn allowed musical instruments, besides the organ, to be employed in the music.|$|E

Negative reviews and comments talked about the poor production and guitars, and the lack of speed in the music, combined with the monotony of the sound. Seward felt that the album [...] "is not 'heavy' music in the <b>least,</b> <b>if</b> we’re talking volume and crunch", but that [...] "it is 'heavy' music if we’re talking about the end product: a deep and pervasively creepy atmosphere that is compelling in its use of silence and hushed reverence for the forest floor".|$|E
500|$|When Warner Bros. {{shut down}} {{pre-production}} of The Fountain in 2002, Aronofsky reserved rights {{to publish a}} graphic novel based on the script that was not produced. He said, [...] "I {{knew it was a}} hard film to make, and I said at <b>least</b> <b>if</b> Hollywood fucks me over at least I'll make a comic book out of it." [...] He shopped the story to Vertigo Comics and met comic book artist Kent Williams, whose illustrations impressed him. Aronofsky hired Williams to create the graphic novel, and Ari Handel, co-writer for the film, provided Williams with research, photographs, and images on [...] "Mayans, astronomy, pulsars, and all kinds of cool stuff" [...] for the graphic novel's design. Aronofsky gave Williams the freedom to interpret the story as the artist saw fit.|$|E
500|$|The United Kingdom law {{relating}} to moral rights has been repeatedly criticised, primarily {{for failing to}} entirely comply with the Berne Convention. Bently and Sherman {{point out that the}} right to object to derogatory treatment uses a far narrower definition of treatment than the Convention, which merely requires that the author be able to object to [...] "any... derogatory action" [...] without limitation. Vaver notes a [...] "grudging attitude toward moral rights, at <b>least</b> <b>if</b> the expression given these rights in [...] is any testament". Article 5(2) of the Berne Convention requires that the exercise of authors' moral rights [...] "shall not be subject to any formality", while the right to attribution requires that the author assert ownership in writing, and is not available to authors by default. In addition, the exclusion of things such as encyclopedias, computer programs and typefaces is [...] "out of step with international practise".|$|E
