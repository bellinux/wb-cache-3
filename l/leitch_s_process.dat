This ratio is of particular relevance to constrain the <b>s</b> <b>process</b> yields of fast rotating massive stars at low metallicity. Recent results on the (α,γ) channel have made it necessary to measure the (α,n) reaction more precisely and investigate {{the effect of the}} new data on <b>s</b> <b>process</b> nucleosynthesis in massive stars. We present a new measurement of the O- 17 (α, n) reaction using a moderating neutron detector. In addition, the (α, n_ 1) channel has been measured independently by observation of the characteristic 1633 keV γ-transition in Ne- 20. The reaction cross section was determined with a simultaneous R-matrix fit to both channels. (α,n) and (α, γ) resonance strengths of states lying below the covered energy range were estimated using their known properties from the literature. A new O- 17 (α,n) reaction rate was deduced for the temperature range 0. 1 GK to 10 GK. It was found that in He burning conditions the (α,γ) channel is strong enough to compete with the neutron channel. This leads to a less efficient neutron recycling compared to a previous suggestion of a very weak (α,γ) channel. <b>S</b> <b>process</b> calculations using our rates confirm that massive rotating stars do {{play a significant role in}} the production of elements up to Sr, but they strongly reduce the <b>s</b> <b>process</b> contribution to heavier elements.

However, experimental data for the stellar 63 Ni(n,gamma) 64 Ni cross section are still missing, but is strongly required for a reliable prediction of the copper abundances. 63 Ni (t 1 / 2 = 101. 2 a) is a branching point and also bottleneck in the weak <b>s</b> <b>process</b> flow, and abehaves differently during core He and shell C burning. During core He burning the reaction flow proceeds via beta-decay to 63 Cu, and a change of the 63 Ni(n,gamma) 64 Ni cross section would have no influence. However, this behavior changes at higher temperatures and neutron densities during the shell C burning phase. Under these conditions, a significant amount of the <b>s</b> <b>process</b> nucleosynthesis flow is passing through the channel 62 Ni(n,gamma) 63 Ni(n,gamma) 64 Ni. At present only theoretical estimates are available for the 63 Ni(n,gamma) 64 Ni cross section. The corresponding uncertainty affects the production of 63 Cu in present <b>s</b> <b>process</b> nucleosynthesis calculations and propagates to the abundances of the heavier species up to A= 70. So far, experimental information is also missing for the inverse 64 Ni(gamma,n) channel. We have measured for the first time the 64 Ni(gamma,n) 63 Ni cross section and also combined for the first time successfully the photoactivation technique with subsequent Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS). The activations at the ELBE facility in Dresden-Rossendorf were followed by the 63 Ni/ 64 Ni determination with AMS at the MLL accelerator laboratory in Garching. First results indicate that theoretical predictions have overestimated this cross section up to now. If this also holds for the inverse channel 63 Ni(n,gamma) 64 Ni, more 63 Ni is accumulated during the high neutron density regime of the C shell that will contribute to the final abundance of 63 Cu by radiogenic decay. In this case, also a lower <b>s</b> <b>process</b> efficiency is expected for the heavier species along the neutron capture path up to the Ga-Ge regio...|$|R
