25|$|Although {{some members}} of the Liberty Party {{supported}} woman's rights, including women's suffrage, Garrison's Liberator continued to be the leading advocate of woman's rights throughout the 1840s, publishing editorials, speeches, <b>legislative</b> <b>reports</b> and other developments concerning the subject. In February 1849, Garrison's name headed the women's suffrage petition sent to the Massachusetts legislature, the first such petition sent to any American legislature, and he supported the subsequent annual suffrage petition campaigns organized by Lucy Stone and Wendell Phillips. Garrison took {{a leading role in the}} May 30, 1850, meeting that called the first National Woman's Rights Convention, saying in his address to that meeting that the new movement should make securing the ballot to women its primary goal. At the national convention held in Worcester the following October, Garrison was appointed to the National Woman's Rights Central Committee, which served as the movement's executive committee, charged with carrying out programs adopted by the conventions, raising funds, printing proceedings and tracts, and organizing annual conventions.|$|E

Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with (a) teachers’ legislation knowledge and (b) teachers’ policy knowledge. Teachers with higher levels of knowledge had a combination of pre- and in-service training about child sexual abuse and more positive attitudes toward reporting, held administration positions in their school, and had reported child sexual abuse at least once during their teaching career.

Together with Stone, he compiled and publishedThe Woman's Rights Almanac for 1858, which provided data such as income disparity between the sexes as well as a summary of gains made by the national movement during its first seven years. He also compiled and published, in 1858, [...] "Consistent Democracy: The Elective Franchise for Women.

40|$|Most Australian States and Territories have {{legislation}} compelling {{teachers to}} report suspicions {{that a child}} has been or {{is likely to be}} abused or neglected. However, these 'mandatory reporting' laws have significant differences, so teachers in different States and Territories may have quite different <b>legislative</b> duties to <b>report</b> suspected child abuse and neglect. It is important that teachers have an accurate understanding of what they are and are not required to report under the relevant legislation. Legislators and policymakers should also be aware of the differences between laws in Australian jurisdictions to inform ongoing evaluation of their jurisdiction's legal framework; the current contrast between jurisdictions, and particularly the absence in Western Australia of mandatory reporting legislation, recently prompted the Commonwealth Attorney-General to endorse substantial equality in legislation concerning child protection. The {{purpose of this article is}} first to introduce the broad context of mandatory reporting laws before detailing the <b>legislative</b> <b>reporting</b> obligations of Australian teachers. This synthesis reveals some significant differences in the laws between jurisdictions, thus raising questions for legislators and policymakers. Policy-based reporting obligations, which operate in two States instead of <b>legislative</b> <b>reporting</b> duties, are noted. Questions about future legislative directions are raised, based on current legislative differences, the issue of whether <b>legislative</b> <b>reporting</b> duties are more appropriate and effective in practice than policy-based reporting duties, and the absence of research into teacher knowledge of law and policy and into teacher reporting practice. It is recommended that research be undertaken to help answer these pressing questions...|$|R

40|$|To improve {{detection}} {{of child sexual}} abuse, many jurisdictions have enacted mandatory reporting laws requiring selected persons to report known and suspected cases.

What effects will the new <b>legislative</b> <b>reporting</b> duties have on numbers of reports, and outcomes of reports, of suspected child sexual abuse?
