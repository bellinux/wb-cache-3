This paper outlines conceptualization of gambling as a ‘dangerous consumption’. Secondly, it examines the dominant regulatory paradigm responsive regulation (RR) and adequacy of RR as conceptual framework for the challenges posed by gambling as a ‘dangerous consumption’. Thirdly, it draws on a regulatory case study of RR in practice, drawing on a multi method approach to regulation of an Australian land-based casino [Victoria’s monopoly Crown Casino]. It concludes that current use of RR is inadequate to the task and argues for alternatives principles and public health approach as in the OECD hazard avoidance model applied to chemical accidents. This prioritizes prevention, preparedness [for risk/harm eventualities] and response [enforcement] and points to the need for a more nuanced response to the regulation of dangerous consumptions that directly addresses public interest. </div...|$|R

40|$|New {{technology}} {{is changing the}} nature of gambling with interactive modes of gambling becoming putatively associated with higher rates of problem gambling. This paper presents the first nationally representative data on the prevalence and correlates of problem gambling among Australian adults since 1999 and focuses {{on the impact of}} interactive gambling. A telephone survey of 15, 006 adults was conducted. Of these, 2, 010 gamblers (all interactive gamblers and a randomly selected subsample of those reporting <b>land-based</b> <b>gambling</b> in the past 12 months) also completed more detailed measures of problem gambling, substance use, psychological distress, and help-seeking. Problem gambling rates among interactive gamblers were 3 times higher than for noninteractive gamblers. However, problem and moderate risk gamblers were most likely to attribute problems to electronic gaming machines and <b>land-based</b> <b>gambling,</b> suggesting that although interactive forms of gambling are associated with substantial problems, interactive gamblers experience significant harms from <b>land-based</b> <b>gambling.</b> The findings demonstrate that problem gambling remains a significant public health issue that is changing in response to new technologies, and it is important to develop strategies that minimize harms among interactive gamblers...|$|E

We investigate this question using qualitative and quantitative data collected from an Internet-based survey of 1, 920 Internet gamblers. The primary reasons people gave for preferring Internet gambling were (a) the relative convenience, comfort, and ease of Internet gambling; (b) an aversion to the atmosphere and clientele of land-based venues; (c) a preference for the pace and nature of online game-play; and (d) the potential for higher wins and lower overall expenditures when gambling online. Findings suggest that online venues may offer their clientele a range of experiences and benefits that {{are perceived to be}} unavailable at land-based venues.

Governments throughout the world worry about the product when gambling is more widely available and more private to play. Warnings for problem gambling have long been used in <b>land-based</b> <b>gambling</b> venues but online gambling often does not have this remedy. In addition, non-problem gamblers make up about 99 % of gamblers but little research has tested their reaction to warnings. An online casino was developed to test warnings and found that a significant proportion of non-problem gamblers gambled more frequently after exposure to the warnings.

30|$|The Internet {{has changed}} the way people engage in many activities, {{including}} gambling. Online gambling (compared with <b>land-based</b> <b>gambling)</b> provides players with ease of access, 24 / 7 accessibility, and confidentiality—all within the comfort of a person’s home. This ease of access has been flagged as a potential concern among researchers, regulators, and policy makers alike (Gainsbury 2015; Gainsbury and Wood 2011; Räsänen et al. 2013). Specifically, online gambling is often framed as a ‘risky’ form of gambling that may heighten {{the risk of developing}} a gambling disorder (Gainsbury et al. 2015 b; Griffiths et al. 2009; McBride and Derevensky 2009; Olason et al. 2011; Wood et al. 2007). In this light, it may be informative to examine factors that propel young adults to gamble online, including the link between social casino gaming and online gambling. This is because there is increasing evidence of the role played by social casino games in precipitating online gambling (Wohl et al. 2017) and young adults are increasingly exposed to social casino games (Kim et al. 2016).|$|E

A second aim was to compare interactive and non-interactive gamblers in terms of socio-demographic characteristics, attitudes and beliefs about gambling and gambling participation. In a nationally representative telephone survey, 15, 006 Australian adults completed measures assessing past 12 -month gambling participation and a sub-sample completed questions about interactive gambling and beliefs.

40|$|While {{many studies}} have {{examined}} self-exclusion few {{have focused on the}} processes through which gamblers return {{at the end of their}} agreements. In 2014, the RGC Centre for the Advancement of Best Practices examined voluntary self-exclusion reinstatement and renewal in an effort to develop evidence-informed best-practices for both <b>land-based</b> and online <b>gambling</b> operations. The presentation outlines the findings of the study and the recommended best practices for reintegration and ban renewal. The study examined a range of practices around the world. In the end the study recommended an active reinstatement process in which all participants are required to apply to return to the venue. The study also outlines a series of steps to reinstatement that takes into account the risks to the individual and the venue. Those who are found to have significant markers of gambling risks are required to participate in educational or support services before reinstatement is available. For those who complete their self-exclusion term without such markers, these services are offered on a voluntary basis. Active renewal of self-exclusion (i. e., an extension of the voluntary self-ban) is also available for those who want it. This best-practice research included a literature review, a review of self-exclusion training and procedural documents, key-informant interviews with gaming venue employees, two focus group discussions with players experienced with self-exclusion, and a round table panel discussion with experts. Findings are published in a report entitled Insight 2014 : Best Practices for Self-Exclusion Reinstatement and Renewal by the Responsible Gambling Council...|$|R
30|$|A second {{mechanism}} by which players migrated from social casino games to online gambling was via the inflated payout rates on social casino games. Note this mechanism was also identified in the two pathways model proposed by King and Delfabbro (2016). Specifically, participants felt an increased confidence in winning should they have engaged in real-money gambling. Further, several participants stated that their frequent wins on social casino games propelled them to try engaging in online gambling. This {{is in line with}} previous research, which found that a portion of casino gamers play these games to build up their ‘skill’ before migrating to <b>gambling</b> in <b>land-based</b> or online <b>gambling</b> venues (see Kim et al. 2016). However, the inflated payout rates may give players an inflated belief in the skill, and, of course, there is no skill if the game of choice is one of pure-chance, like a slot machine. In fact, social casino game outcomes are not based on random odds and mathematics, but are rather designed to enhance player enjoyment (Wohl et al. 2017). Because of this, the social casino gamer wins more than he loses (Sévigny et al. 2005), which in turn, may falsely increase their confidence in winning, as proposed by King and Delfabbro (2016). Providing further support that frequent wins and perception of skills as a process by which social casino games to lead to online gambling, Hollingshead et al. (2016) showed that playing social casino games for skill purposes have been linked to problematic gambling behaviors. In this light, it would behoove regulators to enforce payout rates that are similar to gambling activities, or at very least mandate social casino gaming operators to inform players of that social casino games are not based on random odds as their gambling counterparts.|$|R
40|$|While Internet {{gambling}} {{is a relatively}} new leisure pursuit it is no longer a prodigy or new form of gambling. Comparatively speaking there is a poor understanding of the use, effect and influence of this activity in the context of other gambling behaviour and activities, so as to inform policy decisions, promote safe and responsible gambling, and exemplify a win-win solution for its clients and the industry. The transition to Internet <b>gambling</b> from <b>land-based</b> or no <b>gambling</b> is an important area for research. With player tracking and identification, the possibility exists for responsible gambling features and tools to be developed for online gambling sites, which could be highly effective in providing a safer <b>gambling</b> environment than <b>land-based</b> venues. The Internet has altered the dynamics of gambling at a global level. The ubiquitous nature of the Internet facilitates access to online gambling 24 x 7. The introduction of smartphones and tablets allows patrons to gamble on the go, at an event, or even watching a game. Internet gambling seems to be more popular among adolescents and young adults. Some social networks such as Facebook have given their blessing to what was once considered an immoral or socially destructive behavior, with the availability of online gambling on social networking sites. Social networks are also facilitating gambling operators by allowing them to advertise and recruit players as part of their marketing strategy. Internet gambling provides benefits for patrons in terms of ease of access, convenience, range of payment methods, variety of gambling options, privacy and anonymity, escapism, responsiveness and reliability of online operators and the range of operators available compared to land based gambling. Methodology limitations mean that no generalisations can be made on what creates value from the customers perspective in the online gambling industry, however analysis and findings indicate that this phenomenon is worthy of further research...|$|R
40|$|It {{remains unclear}} if {{gambling}} advertising and promotion increase demand for, and consumption of, gambling, or only affect market share distributions without increasing total consumption. Although {{this has been}} investigated in relation to <b>land-based</b> <b>gambling,</b> studies have not examined how such marketing influences behavioural patterns of Internet gamblers. The aim of this study, therefore, was to explore ways in which advertising and promotion of Internet gambling may contribute to increased consumption of gambling. Qualitative {{interviews were conducted with}} 50 Internet gamblers drawn from the general population, and 31 treatment-seeking Internet gamblers. In-depth analysis of interview transcripts revealed limited reported effectiveness of advertising and promotions in converting non-gamblers to Internet gamblers. However, general population gamblers reported occasionally gambling more than intended (increased consumption) in response to free bet and deposit offers. A proportion of treatment-seekers reported increased gambling, particularly associated with bonus offers that required matched deposits and gambling before any winnings could be collected. Advertisements and promotions invoked urges to gamble among treatment-seeking gamblers, and appeared to some participants to be designed to target individuals who had taken steps to limit or cease gambling.

The {{diagnostic and statistical}} manual (4 th edition) multiple response format for juveniles (DSM-IV-MR-J) (Fisher in J Gambl Stud 16 : 253 – 273, 2000) was filled by 1, 004 students (597 boys, 407 girls) recruited by random selection of classes. The response rate was 86. 6 %. Results indicate that more respondents participated in <b>land-based</b> <b>gambling</b> than Internet gambling (63. 5 vs. 3. 5 %) but online gamblers are 1. 5 and 3. 2 times more likely to develop pathological and at-risk gambling than non-Internet gamblers.

40|$|Advertisements for {{gambling}} {{products have}} historically been restricted due to their potential to normalize gambling and contribute to excessive gambling behaviours among vulnerable populations. However, social media enables gambling operators to promote products and brands with fewer constraints than in traditional forms of media. This study investigated how social media is used by gambling operators to promote gambling activities including {{an analysis of the}} latent messages that are conveyed. A representative sample of major land-based and online gambling venues and operators, including casinos, clubs, hotels, lottery and wagering operators (n = 101), was obtained. Websites and social media profiles of gambling operators were audited to investigate the types of social media used, content of promotions, and prevalence of responsible gambling messaging. The results showed that Facebook and Twitter were the dominant platforms used, most commonly by casinos and online wagering operators. A key finding was that online gambling operators included gambling content in conjunction with related news and events, as well as unrelated content, as way of normalizing gambling within a broader social context. Unlike <b>land-based</b> <b>gambling</b> promotions, responsible gambling information tended not to feature in operators’ posts and profiles. The key messages propagated in social media gambling promotions were positively framed, and tended to encourage gambling using a range of cross-promotional tactics to emphasize the winning aspect of gambling. The implications of freely accessible and pervasive gambling promotions via social media are discussed with respect to the general community as well as vulnerable populations...|$|E

The aim of this study is to examine online and <b>land-based</b> <b>gambling</b> behaviour among adolescents in 3 Canadian provinces (Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador, Saskatchewan) prior to the implementation of legalized online gambling. Methods Data are from 10, 035 students in grades 9 to 12 who responded to the 2012 – 2013 Youth Gambling Survey (YGS) supplement, a questionnaire administered as part of the Canadian Youth Smoking Survey (YSS, 2012) in 3 provinces: Newfoundland and Labrador (n[*]=[*] 2, 588), Ontario (n[*]=[*] 3, 892), and Saskatchewan (n[*]=[*] 3, 555). Results Overall, 41. 6  % of adolescents (35. 9  % of females and 47. 4  % of males) had gambled in the past 3  months. 9. 4  % of adolescents had gambled online in the past 3  months alone (3. 7  % of females and 15. 3  % of males). The most popular form of online gambling was online sports betting. Adolescents also engaged in online simulated gambling including internet poker (9. 1  %) and simulated gambling on Facebook (9. 0  %). Few adolescents participated in online gambling exclusively and online gamblers were more likely than land-based gamblers to engage in multiple forms of gambling. A higher proportion of adolescent online gamblers scored “high” or “low to moderate” in problem gambling severity compared to land-based only gamblers.

40|$|This report {{provides}} {{a summary of}} literature which has been published on developments in gambling since 2013, {{in addition to an}} analysis of the responses from consultation with gambling industry stakeholders and experts. The aims of the report are to highlight emerging trends and developments in gambling since 2013, with a focus on the following specific areas: international legislation, gambling industry mergers, services provided to problem gamblers and gambling technology. Examination of gambling legislation internationally looked at how international legislation has been dealing with emerging issues such as online gambling, sports betting, harm reduction, problem gambling and advertising. Gambling industry mergers, which have become increasingly common in recent years, are discussed with regard to the reasons for these mergers. Services which are available both in Ireland and internationally for problem gamblers   2 and those affected by problem gambling were also examined. Issues which have arisen include service providers which are funded by the gambling industry itself and the usage levels of gambling services online versus <b>land-based</b> <b>gambling</b> support services as well as a lack of support services for families affected by problem gambling. The review of technological developments in the gambling industry covers both online gambling developments and land-based technological developments. New research into the risks of both online gambling and machine based gambling as well as aspects necessary for successful use of pre-commitment systems in managing the risks associated with both are summarised. The emergence and popularity of social media and social media gaming, and how the gambling industry is embracing this technology, was a common theme in much of the literature surrounding online gambling. An important factor that is looked at is the blurring of lines between online gambling and social media games which simulate gambling. This is a continually evolving area and as such requires monitoring...|$|E
40|$|Background: Previous {{studies of}} problem Internet gamblers {{have failed to}} {{distinguish}} whether their problem gambling relates to Internet or <b>land-based</b> <b>gambling</b> modes. Therefore, characteristics and help-seeking behaviors of people whose gambling problems relate specifically to Internet gambling are unknown, but could inform the optimal alignment of treatment and support services with the needs and preferences of problem gamblers. Objective: This study aimed to compare (1) characteristics of problem Internet gamblers and problem land-based gamblers and (2) uptake of different types and modes of help between problem Internet gamblers and problem land-based gamblers. Hypothesis 1 was that problem Internet gamblers {{are less likely to}} seek help. Hypothesis 2 was that problem Internet gamblers are more likely to use online modes of help. Methods: A sample of 620 respondents meeting criteria for problem gambling was drawn from an online survey of 4594 Australian gamblers. Respondents were recruited through advertisements on gambling and gambling help websites, Facebook, and Google. Measures consisted of gambling participation; proportion of gambling on the Internet; most problematic mode of gambling; help seeking from 11 different sources of formal help, informal help, and self-help for gambling problems; psychological distress (Kessler 6); problem gambling severity (Problem Gambling Severity Index, PGSI); and demographics. Results: Problem Internet gamblers were significantly more likely than problem land-based gamblers to be male (χ 21 = 28. 3, Pt 616. 33 = 4. 62, Pd= 0. 37), have lower psychological distress (χ 21 = 5. 4, P=. 02, φ= 0. 09), and experience problems with sports and race wagering (χ 24 = 228. 5, P 21 = 6. 9, P 21 = 14. 3, P Conclusions: The findings suggest that more targeted and innovative efforts may be needed to increase use of gambling help by problem Internet gamblers. Alternatively, their lower PGSI and K 6 scores suggest Internet problem gamblers may have less need for gambling-related help. This is the first known study to classify problem Internet gamblers as those whose problem gambling specifically relates to Internet gambling. Further research is needed to better understand why help-seeking rates are lower among Internet problem gamblers...|$|E
40|$|Beginning in {{the early}} to mid- 1990 s, as Internet access {{expanded}} into workplaces and private residences, gamblers in Western societies were introduced to a new realm of gambling opportunities, based on the Internet. Each of the traditional forms of gambling, widely available in land-based venues, soon appeared in electronic format over the Internet, and have since been easily accessible to any person with an Internet connection and means of electronically transferring money. Virtually mediated casino games, slot machines, bingos, lotteries, sports wagering, horse race betting, and skill games are all now readily accessible, with new forms of gambling and new ways of remote gambling (e. g., interactive television) continually being added. While Internet gambling is becoming a more socially acceptable and legally available activity, the expansion of Internet gambling is outpacing peoples' understanding of the phenomenon, as well as outpacing many of the laws that are supposed to regulate gambling activity. Consequently, we find ourselves in a situation where we have insufficient knowledge of online gambling, including the characteristics of gamblers, the dynamics of Internet gambling behavior, the potential link between Internet gambling and problem gambling, and the most appropriate regulatory and legislative stance to take with respect to Internet gambling. In light of persisting ambiguities and gaps in the existing academic and policy literature, the present report comprises one of the most thorough academic examinations of Internet gamblers to date. The first part of the report provides a context for the present investigation by providing a comprehensive review of the history of Internet gambling, the current worldwide situation, regulatory frameworks for Internet gambling in different jurisdictions, and concerns with Internet gambling. The second part of the report discusses results from two surveys. The first survey is a random digit dial (RDD) Telephone Survey of 8, 498 Canadian adults conducted from January 2006 to June 2007 ('Canadian Telephone Survey'). The second survey is an online self-administered survey of 12, 521 adults, from 105 countries, conducted from June to December 2007 ('International Online Survey'). These surveys collected information about people‟s demographic characteristics, <b>land-based</b> <b>gambling</b> behaviour, Internet gambling behaviour, stock market gambling, attitudes toward gambling, motivations for gambling on the Internet, gambling fallacies, and problem gambling as assessed by the Canadian Problem Gambling Index (CPGI). The International Online Survey also served as an intervention, as participants were provided with detailed feedback about their gambling behaviour relative to others, a projection of their yearly expenditures, explanations of why certain beliefs they held were gambling fallacies, their risk for becoming a problem gambler, their current score on the Canadian Problem Gambling Index (CPGI), Internet links to treatment resources, and a demonstration of how their predictive ability for random events is no better than chance, and how there is no relationship between their prediction confidence and prediction success.

40|$|Interactive {{technology}} has helped online gambling {{to become a}} more popular leisure time activity over the last decade. Alongside this development, new forms of Responsible Gaming tools such as voluntary limit setting and personalized feedback have been introduced. These interventions require a gambling environment with identified play such as online gambling and card-based <b>land-based</b> <b>gambling.</b> This thesis investigates the effects of personalized Responsible Gaming tools on subsequent gambling behaviour and also introduces a novel measure of monetary gambling involvement (i. e., 'theoretical loss'). Following reviews of the relevant literature and methodologies used, Studies 1 and 2 in Chapters 4 and 5 introduce the concept of theoretical loss, a monetary measure of gambling intensity. Study 1 utilised a simulation experiment {{and concluded that the}} theoretical loss is advantageous over bet-size with regard to measuring monetary involvement. Study 2 validated the results of Study 1 based on real-world gambling data from a large sample of 100, 000 online players. Study 3 is also based on a sample of players from a real-world gambling environment and concluded that the setting of voluntary time and money limits lead to positive changes in gambling behaviour. It was also shown that the effect of time and money limits depended upon the types of games played. For instance, slot players benefited from money limits whereas poker players spent less money playing if they set time limits. Studies 4 and 5 investigated the effects of a pop-up message that appeared after 1, 000 consecutive slot games. Both studies showed that only a minority of playing sessions lasted longer than 1, 000 consecutive games. Study 4 compared the number of sessions that lasted 1, 000 games before the pop-up was introduced with the number of sessions that lasted 1, 000 games after the pop-up was introduced. Results demonstrated that the pop-up prompted a small minority of players to cease their playing session. Study 5 investigated a modified pop-up message that was formulated in a motivational way and contained normative information. Almost twice as many players ceased to play {{as a consequence of the}} enhanced pop-up message compared to the previous simple pop-up message. This led to the conclusion that the way a message is formulated is a crucial aspect of behavioural change. The hypothesis that self-appraisal messages and normative feedback have an effect on behavioural change was supported. In Study 6, players of an online gambling website who had voluntarily signed up to a behavioural feedback system (i. e., mentor) where subject to analysis. These players received elaborate visual and numerical information concerning the past six months of their gambling behaviour. The player front-end – which displayed various types of information (losses, types of games played, playing duration, etc.) – was in line with Human-Computer-Interaction (HCI) principles. Results indicated that the personalized feedback system achieved the anticipated effect and that the time and money spent gambling was significantly reduced compared to that of the control group. The main results were also validated by additional analysis showing that the individual players reacted similarly with respect to time and money spent when provided with personalized feedback. The studies in this thesis demonstrate for the first time that voluntary limit setting, interactive pop-up messages, and personalized feedback can affect player behaviour positively in a real-world environment. The studies also demonstrate differences among subpopulations of players. It is almost impossible to uncover such insights in laboratory settings or with self-recollected information because a longer history of playing behaviour is necessary in order to extract player profiles. However, this thesis did not consider cognitive information as it was purely based on behavioural tracking data. Also, the data mostly came from one operator and players were not randomly assigned to experimental conditions. Consequently, future research should try to overcome these limitations and combine cognitive and behavioural data...|$|E
