50|$|<b>Live-bait</b> <b>fishing</b> {{for blue}} marlin {{normally}} uses small tuna species, with skipjack generally {{considered the best}} choice. As trolling speed is limited because baits must be trolled slowly to remain alive, live-baiting is normally chosen where fishing areas are relatively small and easily covered, such as nearfish aggregating device buoys and {{in the vicinity of}} steep underwater ledges.|$|E

A preliminary survey was made at Vizhinjam from May, 1986 to April, 1987 {{to find out the}} availability of <b>live-bait</b> <b>fishes.</b> And the study indicates that the species like Caesio caerulaureus, Dipterygonotus leucogrammicus and Pranesus duodecimalis holds the potential to be used as bait fish after further studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} the pole and line fishery of Lakshadweep depends, among other factors, {{directly}} on the availability in sufficient quantities of suitable <b>live-bait</b> <b>fishes</b> around the islands. Information on the live-bait resources of Lakshadweep {{is limited to a}} few reports from Minicoy- Jones (1958, 1964) described the fishing method, storage and utilisation of bait fish and Iisted the various species of <b>live-bait</b> <b>fishes</b> of Lakshadweep. Jones (1961 a, 1961 b) has predicted the potentialities of Spratelloides delicatulus and S. japonicus as live-bait for pole and line fishery for skipjack much earlier than mechanised fishing was introduced in the northern islands of Lakshadweep. Thomas (1964) made some observations on the fluctuations in the <b>live-bait</b> <b>fishes</b> at Minicoy. Fluctuations in the seasonal availability of live-baits at Minicoy during the years 1981 - 85 has been presented by Pillai et al. (1986). However, details of exploited bait fish resources and seasonal abundance of different bait species around the various islands is still lacking...|$|R
40|$|The <b>live-bait</b> <b>fishes</b> play {{a pivotal}} role in the {{development}} and success of the pole-and-line fishery in Lakshadweep. The total <b>live-bait</b> <b>fish</b> catch from this insular area is estimated to be 125 t in recent years. The major groups exploited at Minicoy are clupeids, caesionids and apogonids. The clupeid, Spratelloides delicatulus is the only species caught as bait in the northern islands. The major <b>fishing</b> areas for <b>live-baits</b> are Minicoy, Agatti, Suheli, Perumal Par, Bitra, Valiapani and Cheriyapani. Both meteorological and hydrographical factors influence the recruitment of migratory groups to the lagoon, while resident forms depend on the recruitment success.

40|$|One of {{the target}} {{resources}} of rod and <b>live-bait</b> <b>fishing</b> on the Brazilian coast is Bonito Listrado (a species of tuna), and success depends on locating the shoals, which are highly migratory. The prediction of locations where shoals are concentrated can be made based on information on the surface temperature of the sea. This project enabled the elaboration of fishing maps, based on historical data (on-board log data) over 20 years and SST (surface temperature of the sea). These capture maps indicated the areas with a higher probability of existence of shoals {{of interest to the}} rod and live-bait tuna fishing fleet. Providing capture maps in exchange for data registered in the on-board log books opens the possibility of spreading, among the tuna fleet based in the Port of Itajaí/Navegantes, the exchange of information among fisherman and research and fishing companies. While these capture maps can contribute to reducing the time spent searching for shoals, the information provided by the fisherman is important for the management of rod and <b>live-bait</b> <b>fishing,</b> aiming at its sustainability.

40|$|One of {{the target}} {{resources}} of rod and <b>live-bait</b> <b>fishing</b> on the Brazilian coast is Bonito Listrado (a species of tuna), and success depends on locating the shoals, which are highly migratory. The locations where shoals are concentrated can be made based on information on the surface temperature of the sea (SST) and oceanographic features such as the formation of vortexes, fronts and other phenomena. In spite {{of the availability of}} this technology, some fishermen today still use other methods to locate the fish. These include the recording of capture data in the on-board logbook. Based on the images, windows were drawn up indicating the gradients for the surface temperature of the sea, for the oceanic region between Cabo Frio (Rio de Janeiro) and Chui (Rio Grande do Sul). The relationships studied between the occurrence of tuna, oceanographic phenomena (SST) and bathymetric features, established the norms for distribution of fishing resources and their availability for fishing.

40|$|Minicoy, {{the southernmost}} island of the Laccadive Archipelago, {{is the most}} {{important}} tuna fishing centre in the Indian Union. The fishing industry of the island with special reference to the tuna fishery has been comprehensively desc?ibed by Jones and Kumaran (1959). The entire fishery is a pole and line one for the oceanic skipjack Katsuwonus pelamis (Linnaeus) mainly and the yellowfin tuna Neothunnus macropterus (Temminck & Schlegel), using <b>live-bait</b> <b>fishes.</b> The tuna livebait fishery of Minicoy has been dealt with in detail by Jones (1958). Appreciable fluctuations have been noticed in the catches in the island from year to year. Even though large shoals may be available for capture {{in the vicinity of the}} island, t k gmiktbility of the right kind of bait fishes in sufficient quantities throughout the fishing season, may be a factof influencing the catches of a particular year. About forty species of fishes are used by the fishermen of Minicoy as tuna live-bait. Of these only ten species show regularity in their occurrence, the rest being specimens entering the nets during fishing. The present study reports on the relative abundance of the major species of <b>live-bait</b> <b>fishes</b> of Minicoy...|$|R

40|$|Investigations {{conducted}} by the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute have indicated the possibilities of exploitation of the potential marine resources especially tunas and other commercially important fishes around Lakshadweep. Realising {{the need for the}} increased exploitation of the marine fishery resources, emphasis has been given to the biology and assessment of the resources of tunas, fishery and biology of tuna <b>live-bait</b> <b>fishes</b> and the environmental factors affecting their distribution and abundance. Of the various developmental schemes proposed to be implemented in Lakshadweep in recent years, exploitation of fishery resources has. been given considerable importance by researchers and planners alike. As the land area being limited, the scope for the development of land based industries is very meagre and hence any major development programme envisaged has to be centred on the exploitation of marine fish resources...|$|R
40|$|The tuna fishery of Minicoy island depends {{mainly on}} the oceanic {{skipjack}} Kutsuwonus pelamis and to a smaller extent on the yellowfin tuna Neothunnus macropterus. A comprehensive account of the fishery has been given by Jones and Kumaran (1959). The gear employed is the pole and line, using <b>live-bait</b> <b>fishes.</b> Data on the size composition of tunas are of value in elucidating their population structure and migrations. An intensive study on the fishery of the island was carried out during the tuna fishing season November 1960 -April 1961. The {{results of the investigation}} are presented in this report. The size composition of the two species for the season has been studied by the examination of samples from the landings in Minicoy. Data on the total catches of each species and the catch-per-man hour-effort are also given...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} for marine fisheries {{resources in the}} EEZ around the Andaman and Nicobar Inlands has been estimated and marine fishing at present is confined to the artisanal fisheries limited to the very narrow belt of the coastal areas which {{can be reached by}} the indigenous fishing crafts operating the traditional fishing gears. The rich fisheries wealth around these islands have to be exploited by suitable craft and gear specially oriented for the pelagic fisheries resources. After conducting research work on assessment of fisheries resources of the area, it is felt that there is great scope for developing sea farming in the coastal areas of Andaman and Nicobar islands for finfish and molluscs. Examination of fish catches at a number of places on the islands and those from the confiscated vessels indicated that fish may be dying due to old age. This is a clear indication of under exploitation of the resources. Development of offshore and oceanic fisheries needs development of necessary infrastructural facilities on the islands for berthing, loading, unloading, repair, dry docking, bunkering and storage. The National Marine Park area harbours a number of varieties of corals, ornamental <b>fishes,</b> <b>live-bait</b> and other invertebrates. The potential of various marine ornamental fishes has to be assessed for rational exploitation in due course...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the cost of {{production}} and economic viability of production of Lambari in Monte Castelo/SP, with the primary market for the <b>live-bait</b> for sport <b>fishing</b> of carnivorous fish. To calculate the operating cost structure was used the model proposed by the Instituto de Economia Agricola from São Paulo/Brazil. In analyzing the economic viability of investment, we determined the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and Pay Back Period. It was noted that the inputs represented approximately 74. 0 % of the EOC (Effective Operating Cost). In the rentability analysis (short term), there was an operating profit of R$ 3, 133. 45 for a cycle, with a profitability of 18. 65 % for four months of production, a cost price of R$ 13. 02 kg(- 1). For viability of the activity (long term), the results were attractive to recovery capital from the 3 (rd) year (Pay Back), with an IRR of 25. 68 % and 89. 0 % return on the producer in 5 years (BCR - benefit cost ratio). The study of costs and economic viability analysis reinforce the importance of rational management in the productive system and the importance of planning and managing the profitability of the activity...|$|R
