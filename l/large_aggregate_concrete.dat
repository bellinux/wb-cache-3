Based on the experimental results, {{it was found that}} the segregation will occur for lightweight <b>aggregate</b> <b>concrete</b> due to floating of coarse aggegate caused by over vibration, and the duration of vibration lead to segregation will be shorter as the mold is smaller. Besides, the optimum vibration duration, which can be detected by observing the specimen surface, did not appear to be constant, and the effective radius of compaction will depend on the amplitude and the diameter of vibrator. The effective radius of compaction could be also estimated from the range of smooth surface, and this method has been proven to be valid by the isostrength diagram obtained from the test results of compacted specimens. 本文以振動棒對輕質骨材混凝土進行振動夯實試驗，一方面觀察混凝土在圓柱型 試體模內的夯實過程與行為；另一方面在大面積混凝土試體上進行單點及兩點的振動夯實， 測析振動能量與振動點對夯實效果的影響。試驗結果顯示，過度的振動作用確實會引起輕質 混凝土中粗骨材上浮的析離現象，試體模愈小者發生析離的振動時間將愈短。輕質骨材混凝 土的最佳振動夯實時間無定值，可由夯實體的表面觀察研判之。至於振動棒的有效作用半徑 則依其振幅與棒身直徑而定，也可由夯實面的平滑範圍估計之，本法已由夯實試體的強度等 勢線分佈圖印證其合理性...|$|R

Over the first few hours, while the mortar/concrete was still fluid, the absolute rate of increase in shear modulus was low. From around 5 hours to around 20 hours, shear modulus increased linearly. Thereafter, shear modulus increased, but at an ever-decreasing rate. The shear velocity of the mortar was calculated to be 1720 m/s after two days, corresponding to a shear modulus of 5. 6 GPa, while the 48 hour-old concrete had a shear modulus of 16. 5 GPa.
