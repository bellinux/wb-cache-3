40|$|Digitally {{addressable}} {{lighting systems}} offer tremendous opportunities for performance {{monitoring and control}} of individual <b>light</b> <b>fixtures.</b> However, the locations of individual <b>light</b> <b>fixtures</b> within a building are not easily differentiable; as such, facility managers cannot easily distinguish and control each fixture. Virtual models contain semantic representation of objects which enable users to visually identify, distinguish and interactively monitor and control building components. To monitor and control <b>light</b> <b>fixtures</b> from these models, each physical fixture needs to be tightly integrated with its virtual representation such as to enable bi-directional coordination.
