The young lady has plucked her hairline to increase the expanse, and thus elegance, of her forehead, and a <b>lock</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> falls at the back in a ponytail. A tight-fitting cap covers her ears, a fashion possibly due to the prevalent belief {{of the time that}} the Virgin Mary conceived through the ear.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{was described}} by Linnaeus in his 18th century work, Systema Naturae, as Falco nisus, but moved to its present genus by French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The current scientific name {{is derived from the}} Latin accipiter, meaning 'hawk' and nisus, the sparrowhawk. According to Greek mythology, Nisus, the king of Megara, was turned into a sparrowhawk after his daughter, Scylla, cut off his purple <b>lock</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> to present to her lover (and Nisus' enemy), Minos.|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks later}} a hard-hat diver, sent down {{to recover the}} gold and other valuables, found the bodies of two women {{at the foot of}} the saloon staircase, one with her arm around the other. The diver tried to reach them to take a <b>lock</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> or some other {{personal}} item that could be identified by their loved ones, but the restriction of the air line made it impossible. The gold in the Captain's cabin was recovered after much difficulty. While recovering the gold, several sharks that were caught near the wreck were found to contain human bones, remains and jewellery.|$|E

These <b>locks</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> were seen as mementos and served to comfort the surviving loved ones. These <b>locks</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> were typically kept in lockets though small jars, {{and in some cases}} jewelry. Jewelry could include everything from bracelets, to earrings, as well as various types of brooches.|$|R

The Mecha use David’s {{memories}} to reconstruct the Swinton home and explain to him that they cannot make him human. However, David insists that they recreate Monica from DNA in the <b>lock</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair.</b> The Mecha warn David that the clone can only live for a day, and that the process cannot be repeated. David spends the next day with Monica and Teddy. Before she drifts off to sleep, Monica tells David she has always loved him. Teddy climbs onto the bed and watches the two lie peacefully together.|$|E
5|$|At {{the wedding}} of Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Prince Charming (Joshua Dallas), the Evil Queen (Parrilla) announces her plan to cast a terrible curse on everyone. Despite the misgivings of the Magic Mirror (Esposito) and her valet (Tony Perez), she goes to see the sorceress Maleficent (Kristin Bauer van Straten), to whom she had traded a Dark Curse. Maleficent refuses to return the curse, but the Queen defeats her in a magical battle, taking the curse's scroll. She lets Maleficent live, stating that the sorceress is the only friend she has. Later in the forest, the Queen assembles a number of dark creatures. She demands a <b>lock</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> {{from each of the}} {{assembly}} in order to cast the curse and sacrifices the heart of her prized stallion to complete the spell. The curse, however, fails.|$|E
5|$|The {{conventions}} of Moonlight are based, in part, on a unique mythology. Some {{parts of the}} mythology that are common include a sire, that is the vampire who turns a human into a vampire; though in the show the sire must teach him or her how to live as one. A vampire's bite {{is not enough to}} turn a human into a vampire; the human, when near death, must drink the sire's blood or have vampire blood in his or her system at the moment of death. The process of vampirization also affects their genetics, causing their DNA to be fundamentally altered to suit their bodies' new state. This makes genetic testing between vampires and their human relatives impossible unless the vampire has a sample of their own human DNA from before they were turned, such as a <b>lock</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair.</b> They must consume human blood to survive. They also develop psychic powers and can glimpse the future and the past. This ability, along with their night vision, is an extension of their heightened senses. Daylight does not kill vampires, but does make them progressively weaker. Silver and fire are toxic, whereas garlic, holy water and crucifixes are useless. A vampire's image cannot be captured with analogue cameras containing silver emulsion in the film; digital cameras are able to capture an image because they do not use silver emulsion. Though undead, vampires have a pulse, are not cold blooded (but still don't produce body heat as seen in episode 11 so as heat signature cameras won't see them), and cannot turn into a bat. The best ways to kill them are by decapitation or burning; a stake through the heart is painful but only causes paralysis. Moonlight vampires have many of the preternatural abilities as described in vampire mythology; they have superhuman strength and speed, they heal rapidly from any wound, they can defy gravity to a limited degree to perform parkour feats, their bite has hypnotic effects on weak-minded humans, and they are immortal. Their powers increase as they get older. Their blood has drug-like affects when consumed by humans; causing euphoria and temporarily heightened senses.|$|E

25|$|Women {{invariably}} grew {{their hair}} long and, {{as in other}} European cultures, this custom was also common among the men. It is said that the Gaelic Irish took great pride in their long hair—for example, a person {{could be forced to}} pay the heavy fine of two cows for shaving a man's head against his will. For women, very long hair was seen as a mark of beauty. Sometimes, wealthy men and women would braid their hair and fasten hollow golden balls to the braids. Another style that was popular among some medieval Gaelic men was the glib (short all over except for a long, thick <b>lock</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> towards the front of the head). A band or ribbon around the forehead was the typical way of holding one's hair in place. For the wealthy, this band was often a thin and flexible band of burnished gold, silver or findruine. When the Anglo-Normans and the English colonized Ireland, hair length came to signify one's allegiance. Irishmen who cut their hair short were deemed to be forsaking their Irish heritage. Likewise, English colonists who grew their hair long at the back were deemed to be giving in to the Irish life.|$|E

500|$|Two of the couple's children, one boy and one girl, stand below Seneb {{where the}} legs of an {{ordinary}} person would be. They are depicted nude with their index fingers placed in their mouths and a <b>lock</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> falling {{on one side of}} their heads, indicating that they were below the age of puberty, when Egyptian children were given an [...] "adult" [...] haircut. Seneb and his son are shown with darker skin colouring than his wife and daughter. This was a standard artistic convention used to indicate gender and status, reflecting the fact that high-ranking females would remain indoors and retain a light skin colour while males would gain a darker skin from the hot Egyptian sun. The names of three children are recorded, though the third child was not depicted on the sculpture - presumably for reasons of symmetry. They were named after Seneb's royal masters; his son was called Radjedef-Ankh ("May Radjedef live"), his eldest daughter was Awib-Khufu ("Happy is Khufu") and his younger daughter was Smeret-Radjedef ("Companion of Radjedef"). They are depicted with normal proportions, suggesting that they did not inherit their father's condition.|$|E
500|$|When {{adapting}} the characters for film, Thompson {{found that in}} the novel, [...] "Edward and Brandon are quite shadowy and absent for long periods," [...] and that [...] "making the male characters effective {{was one of the}} biggest problems. Willoughby is really the only male who springs out in three dimensions." [...] Several major male characters in Sense and Sensibility were consequently altered significantly from the novel in an effort to appeal to contemporary audiences. Grant's Edward and Rickman's Brandon are [...] "ideal" [...] modern males who display an obvious love of children as well as [...] "pleasing manners", especially when contrasted with Palmer. Thompson's script both expanded and omitted scenes from Edward's storyline, including the deletion of an early scene in which Elinor assumes that a <b>lock</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> found in Edward's possession is hers, when it belongs to Lucy. He was made more fully realised and honourable than in the novel to increase his appeal to viewers. To gradually show viewers why Brandon is worthy of Marianne's love, Thompson's screenplay has his storyline mirroring Willoughby's; they are similar in appearance, share a love of music and poetry, and rescue Marianne in the rain while on horseback.|$|E

2500|$|In satire, Pope {{achieved}} two of {{the greatest}} poetic satires of all time in the Augustan period. [...] The Rape of the Lock (1712 and 1714) was a gentle mock-heroic. [...] Pope applies Virgil's heroic and epic structure {{to the story of}} a young woman (Arabella Fermor) having a <b>lock</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> snipped by an amorous baron (Lord Petre). [...] The structure of the comparison forces Pope to invent mythological forces to overlook the struggle, and so he creates an epic battle, complete with a mythology of sylphs and metempsychosis, over a game of Ombre, leading to a fiendish appropriation of the <b>lock</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair.</b> [...] Finally, a deux ex machina appears and the <b>lock</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> experiences an apotheosis. [...] To some degree, Pope was adapting Jonathan Swift's habit, in A Tale of a Tub, of pretending that metaphors were literal truths, and he was inventing a mythos to go with the everyday. [...] The poem was an enormous public success.|$|E
