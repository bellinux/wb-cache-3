5|$|Yagan {{would have}} been about 35 years old in 1829 when British {{settlers}} landed {{in the area and}} established the Swan River Colony. For {{the first two years of}} the colony, relations between settlers and Noongar were generally amicable, as there was little competition for resources. The Noongar welcomed the white settlers as Djanga, the returned spirits of their dead. Historical reports noted the two groups shared fish. As time passed, conflicts between the two cultures gradually became more frequent. The settlers incorrectly thought that the Noongar were nomads who had no claim to the land over which they roamed. Colonists fenced off <b>land</b> <b>for</b> <b>grazing</b> and farming according to their traditional practices of land use.|$|E

25|$|Cody {{established}} the TE Ranch, {{located on the}} south fork of the Shoshone River about thirty-five miles from Cody. When he acquired the TE property, he stocked it with cattle sent from Nebraska and South Dakota. The new herd carried the TE brand. The late 1890s were relatively prosperous years for the Wild West show, and he bought more land {{to add to the}} ranch. He eventually held around 8,000 acres (32km²) of private <b>land</b> <b>for</b> <b>grazing</b> operations and ran about 1,000 head of cattle. He operated a dude ranch, pack-horse camping trips, and big-game hunting business at and from the TE Ranch. In his spacious ranch house, he entertained notable guests from Europe and America.|$|E

2500|$|If a {{horse is}} kept in a pasture, the amount of land needed for basic {{maintenance}} varies with climate, an animal needs more <b>land</b> <b>for</b> <b>grazing</b> in a dry climate than in a moist one. [...] An average of between one and [...] of land per horse will provide adequate forage {{in much of the}} world, though hay or other feed may have to be supplemented in winter or during periods of drought. To lower the risk of laminitis, horses also may need to be removed from lush, rapidly changing grass for short periods in the spring and fall (autumn), when the grass is particularly high in non-structural carbohydrates such as fructans. [...] Horses turned out to pasture full time still need to be checked frequently for evidence of injury, parasites, sickness or weight loss.|$|E

25|$|Originally, Quanah, {{like many}} of his contemporaries, was opposed to the opening of tribal <b>lands</b> <b>for</b> <b>grazing</b> by Anglo {{ranching}} interests. But, Quanah changed his position and forged close relationships with a number of Texas cattlemen, such as Charles Goodnight and the Burnett family. As early as 1880, Quanah was working with these new associates in building his own herds. In 1884, due largely to Quanah’s efforts, the tribes received their first “grass” payments <b>for</b> <b>grazing</b> rights on Comanche, Kiowa and Apache lands. It is during this period that the bonds between Quanah and the Burnett family grew strong.|$|R

40|$|In their {{decision}} to partially vacate and partially reverse the district court’s holding for the Defendants, the Ninth Circuit reaffirmed the authority of federal agencies to determine the criteria <b>for</b> <b>grazing</b> on federal <b>land.</b> Additionally, the Ninth Circuit rejected the district court’s attempt to attach long established water rights to grazing rights through necessity. Thus, parties seeking to access federal <b>lands</b> <b>for</b> <b>grazing</b> must seek and acquire a permit through the BLM, removing the possibility of water rights representing a sufficient interest to lay claim to a property right.
