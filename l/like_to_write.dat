500|$|Following his {{appointment}} in 1835 as principal {{conductor of the}} Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, Mendelssohn named his childhood friend Ferdinand David as the orchestra's concertmaster. The work's origins derive from this professional collaboration. In a letter dated 30 July 1838, Mendelssohn wrote to David: [...] "I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a violin concerto for you next winter. One in E minor runs through my head, the beginning of which gives me no peace." ...|$|E
500|$|The audio drama sparked {{speculation}} of {{a second}} sequel to X. In a February 2014 interview, Shinji Hashimoto said that the audio drama was simply meant to expand on the universe and did not mean a sequel was in development. Prior to this, Nojima stated {{that if there was}} enough demand, there could be developments, and that he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> the story for a second sequel. Nojima later revealed to Famitsu [...] "For the record, there’s a plot from start to finish, and if there’s some way we can have it show up elsewhere… well, so I’ve said to Square Enix.” ...|$|E

500|$|Recording for {{the album}} began in 2008, {{less than a}} year after the release of Minutes to Midnight (2007). As with Minutes to Midnight, Shinoda and Rick Rubin {{produced}} the album. Primary recording sessions for A Thousand Suns took place at NRG Recording Studios in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. In November 2008, lead singer Chester Bennington said the new record was a concept album; he said it [...] "sound a little daunting to me, so, I think my confidence level will drop, but when it was presented to us by this friend of ours, we liked the idea. It was an inspiring idea, and it was something we could relate a lot of the things we <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> about to." ...|$|E
500|$|Further {{criticism}} of the Canopus series followed, which included this comment by New York Times critic John Leonard: [...] "One of the many sins for which the 20th century will be held accountable {{is that it has}} discouraged Mrs. Lessing... She now propagandizes on behalf of our insignificance in the cosmic razzmatazz." [...] Lessing replied by saying: [...] "What they didn't realize was that in science fiction is some of the best social fiction of our time. I also admire the classic sort of science fiction, like Blood Music, by Greg Bear. He's a great writer." [...] Lessing said in 1983 that she would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> stories about red and white dwarves, space rockets powered by anti-gravity, and charmed and coloured quarks, [...] "ut we can't all be physicists".|$|E
500|$|While he {{was living}} with Maynard, Salinger {{continued}} to write in a disciplined fashion, a few hours every morning. According to Maynard, by 1972 he had completed two new novels. In a rare 1974 interview with The New York Times, he explained: [...] "There is a marvelous peace in not publishing... I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>write.</b> I love to write. But I write just for myself and my own pleasure." [...] According to Maynard, he saw publication as [...] "a damned interruption". In her memoir, Margaret Salinger describes the detailed filing system her father had for his unpublished manuscripts: [...] "A red mark meant, if I die before I finish my work, publish this 'as is,' blue meant publish but edit first, and so on." [...] A neighbor said that Salinger {{told him that he}} had written 15 unpublished novels.|$|E

500|$|With the album, Badu {{sought to}} augment her music's production, expose {{the work of}} {{underground}} hip hop producers, and exceed listeners' expectations of contemporary music. She explained to Billboard that [...] "in taking on a project like this, I'm taking the responsibility to talk for my race and my planet." [...] In an interview for the New York Post, she explained the album to be about [...] "the war against self ... against your inner being", and said of her hiatus, [...] "I've always taken my time between albums. I'm a performing artist - recording is secondary to me. My performances are what drive me. It's like my therapy. I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a lot while I'm on the road before I even think about recording." [...] Badu also said that she now had a relevant message to express for listeners and was no longer struggling with a creative block.|$|E
500|$|American {{journalist}} and celebrity biographer Andrew Morton {{is known for}} his works on Diana, Princess of Wales, Monica Lewinsky and footballer David Beckham and his wife, Victoria. In October 2000, Morton had hinted that he had American recording artist Madonna as his next project, when he responded to an Independent reader in [...] "You Ask the Questions" [...] section. Asked who he would most <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a biography of, he said: [...] "I've always admired Madonna as an intriguing and charismatic character who has been able to stay at the top for 20 years." [...] A formal announcement was made by Morton's UK publicist Michael O'Mara in April 2001, that Morton had secured access to [...] "those in her [...] inner circle, who have never been interviewed before, about her ambitions, lifestyle and relationships." [...] O'Mara added the reason for choosing Madonna was because she was [...] "one of the most enigmatic and fascinating women of our time, [...] is the undisputed female icon of the modern age." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 2006, Black {{expressed}} {{wishes to}} take a year-long break from acting, though Gass hinted a desire for Tenacious D to end at their current highpoint. However, Black confirmed that a third album would be recorded by announcing that a new song has been written for it entitled [...] "Deth Star". He said that the album would likely be released in 2010, but on other occasions had mentioned the year 2012. In early 2008, Black announced that the band {{was working on a}} new album, and a DVD titled The Complete Masterworks Part 2. The DVD was released later that year, and included a documentary of their world tour entitled D Tour: A Tenacious Documentary. The film focuses on the tour Tenacious D made in support of the film and soundtrack and the consequences of their film's poor showing at the box office. Kyle has commented that the new album only has [...] "one to one and a half" [...] songs written for it, and would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> between twelve and fifteen.|$|E

500|$|Bullen {{wanted the}} episode {{to be an}} {{ordinary}} episode of Cold Feet that {{just happened to be}} set in Australia. The original script included stereotypical references to Australian culture, such as [...] "prawns on the barbie", but these were cut to avoid turning the episode into a travelogue. Bullen told the Sun Herald, [...] "I really wanted to go beyond 'no worries' and 'she'll be right mate'. We've asked most of the local actors to improvise with their own sayings, to make sure we get it right." [...] In 2003, Bullen recalled this episode's script as the most difficult he had ever written. The collapse of Karen and David's marriage was a controversial issue among the writer and producers; two characters had already divorced and Harries wanted to avoid all three of the main relationships failing. After enjoying the quality of the Australian guest stars, Bullen joked to the Sun Herald that he would write a spin-off series featuring Gary Sweet. Eventually, no spin-off series were created. This episode was produced as the final episode of Cold Feet; Mike Bullen did not believe he could continue writing another series and cast members were eager to take other roles. During production in Australia, Bullen's interest in the series was renewed, and he decided he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a final run of episodes.|$|E
500|$|Eternal Punishment was remade for the PlayStation Portable. Like the {{remake of}} Innocent Sin, it was {{directed}} by Shoji Meguro. The original plan at Atlus was to have Innocent Sin and Eternal Punishment released as a single game, but both could not fit onto a single UMD. Even before the completion of Innocent Sins remake, {{when there were no}} plans for a remake of Eternal Punishment, Meguro was keen to make one if the opportunity arose. For the remake, the team had two points of reference: the original version, and the remake of Innocent Sin. The team carried over most of the features implemented Innocent Sins remake while further simplifying and streamlining the mechanics, aiming for a [...] "culmination" [...] to Persona 2 as a whole. A large portion of the initial work was playing through the original version. A new opening animation was created by anime production company Madhouse. In addition to the gameplay modifications, a new scenario was added focusing on Tatsuya's activities before he joined the party. Satomi, after having written the script for a downloadable quest for Innocent Sins remake, was asked whether he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a new scenario for the Eternal Punishments remake, and accepted willingly. During the writing process, Satomi suggested giving Maya dialogue, but this was vetoed as Persona protagonists were silent without exception. The scenario's new characters were designed by Masayuki Doi.|$|E
500|$|Arad later explained, [...] "We {{were working}} on what we called Spider-Man 4 {{and it was the}} same team [...] The problem was we didn't have a story that was strong enough and {{warranted}} ... another movie. And Sam Raimi ... realized we [...] have a good reason to make another one. And between [...] and Tobey and obviously the studio, we all went into it not feeling good about the next story." [...] Tolmach said one reason to restart the series was that the producers felt the core Spider-Man story was that of a boy becoming a man. Screenwriter Steve Kloves did a polish of Sargent's script, saying he had originally declined the opportunity to do so but relented [...] "as a favor" [...] to the filmmakers. [...] "I also really wanted to write for Emma Stone, because I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> for women and I particularly like Emma," [...] he explained. [...] "So ...I did basically character and dialogue, and that was enjoyable for me. So that was my hand in it. And I did a little plot work, {{but a lot of the}} plot was done." [...] He did [...] "a little bit" [...] of dialog for Peter Parker / Spider-Man. In April 2012, writer-director Paul Feig said that Webb [...] "invited me on set, and I did a little bit of writing for that movie, for one of the high school scenes".|$|E

2500|$|It {{was during}} September 2004 that Quick officially {{began working with}} Tokyopop on {{bringing}} Off Beat to shelves, having decided that there would only be three books in her series, making it the shortest story she has ever conceived.

[...] McNair {{took him to the}} POUM barracks, where Orwell immediately enlisted. [...] "Orwell did not know that two months before he arrived in Spain, the [...] NKVD's resident in Spain, Aleksandr Orlov, had assured NKVD Headquarters, 'the Trotskyist organisation POUM can easily be liquidated'—by those, the Communists, whom Orwell took to be allies in the fight against Franco." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lucas's output was prolific; by Max Beerbohm's {{estimation}} {{he spoke}} fewer words than he wrote. Lucas's Punch colleague E V Knox commented, [...] "Lucas's publications include many anthologies and about thirty collections of light essays, on almost any subject that took his fancy, {{and some of}} the titles which he gave to them, Listener's Lure (1905), One Day and Another (1909), Old Lamps for New (1911), Loiterer's Harvest (1913), Cloud and Silver (1916), A Rover I Would Be (1928), indicate sufficiently the lightness, gaiety, and variety of their contents." [...] He wrote travel books, parodies, and books about painters. Of the last he said, [...] "I know very little about pictures, but I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> about them for the benefit of those who know less." [...] Frank Swinnerton wrote of him: ...|$|E
2500|$|Because Variações did {{not have}} the {{knowledge}} to properly compose music by himself, collaboration with other musicians at the writing, recording and producing stages was necessary. He would first collaborate with the musicians Vítor Rua, Tóli César Machado (both from the band GNR) and José Moz Carrapa on his first LP, [...] "Anjo da Guarda", and then with Pedro Ayres Magalhães and Carlos Maria Trindade, at the time, part of the band Heróis do Mar (and later, Madredeus) on the recording of [...] "Dar & Receber". The five members of Heróis do Mar acted as António's studio band; they would become close to Variações, especially Pedro Ayres Magalhães, who speaks fondly of him on the liner notes of [...] "Dar & Receber": [...] "I thank you António, for your enthusiasm and trust, and I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> here that I've gained a friendship".|$|E
2500|$|Absolutely Fabulous first {{aired on}} 12 November 1992 {{and ran for}} three series, until 4 May 1995, when the sixth episode of series 3 was billed as the last ever episode.

Both episodes featured end sequences with flashes to the future. However, after writing Mirrorball, Jennifer Saunders decided she had more ideas, leading to a fourth series, which premiered on 31 August 2001. A fifth series and three specials followed, the last of which aired on 25 December 2004. This {{was followed by a}} short special for Comic Relief in March 2005. In July 2005, Saunders announced she would not be writing or playing Edina again, stating [...] "The 6am calls to go to make-up and all the promotional work wear you down.
