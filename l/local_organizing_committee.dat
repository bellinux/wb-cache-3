5|$|Following a final {{appearance}} at the 1948 Summer Olympics, art competitions {{were removed from the}} Olympic program. Planners of the 1952 Summer Olympics opposed their inclusion on logistical grounds, claiming that the lack of an international association for the event meant that the entire onus of facilitation was placed on the <b>local</b> <b>organizing</b> <b>committee.</b> Concerns were also raised about the professionalism of the event, since only amateurs were allowed to participate in the sporting tournaments, and the growing commercialization of the competitions, as artists had been permitted to sell their submissions {{during the course of the}} Games since 1928. In 1952 an art festival and exhibition was held concurrent with the Games, a tradition that has been maintained in all subsequent Summer Olympics.|$|E

He is also the founder of Li-Ning, a domestic shoe company bearing his name. Although the Li-Ning company was not an official sponsor of the Games, it was associated with them by being the equipment supplier for several Chinese national teams in Beijing, and through Li's status as a Chinese sports and business icon. Due to its exclusive sponsorship rights, Li wore apparel from a rival, Adidas, during the sequence. On the first trading day following the ceremony, Li-Ning's share price increased by 3.52%.|$|E

50|$|Amin’s main {{argument}} is that the anti-police riot of 1922 was nationalist in nature, and that the national memory of it as criminal was constructed {{in the immediate aftermath}} of Gandhi’s reaction and the course of justice pursued by authorities after the initial retaliation. Amin’s extensive research into the riot (and his knowledge of the area) on a cultural, bottom-up level (as well as top-down) seeks to cement the connection between the local actors and the greater nationalist movement. Amin shows the nationalist movement to have deeply penetrated the area around the Chauri Chaura station, both with <b>local</b> <b>organizing</b> <b>committees</b> and propaganda, avoidance of foreign foods and clothing, but more visibly, the presence of many otiyars (volunteers, or nationalist members trained to oppose instability and mob rule) in the countryside begging for grain. Amin shows how Gandhi’s visit of a year earlier was extremely influential, and although misinterpreted in many cases, how his message was directly linked to the riot.|$|R
50|$|In 1999 the new {{location}} for the ISBT CO was Amsterdam, where it {{became a part of}} professional congress organiser (PCO) Eurocongress. Paul Strengers, a doctor at Sanquin Blood Supply took up the role of Secretary General.

In the coming ten years the society would work had to achieve these goals, with Strengers to remain Secretary General for that period. Eurocongress organised ISBT congresses together with the CO and <b>local</b> <b>organizing</b> <b>committees.</b> The help of a PCO took away economic risks attached to congresses as they were able to provide professional assistance and detailed advice. As the CO had moved to a different country, the ISBT statutes and by-laws were also updated and adapted to Dutch law.|$|R
40|$|The claimed {{benefits}} of sport events on sport participation rely on an asserted “trickle-down effect”. There {{is a lack}} of empirical evidence that events can trigger increased physical activity and sport participation, and research has focused on large-scale events. This paper compares two previously hosted medium-sized sport events, and examines the degree to which local (sport) organizations and <b>local</b> <b>organizing</b> <b>committees</b> (LOC) endeavoured to leverage each sport event for sport participation purposes. Document analysis and semi-structured interviews revealed overarching assumptions that the events in and of themselves were sufficient to engender participation outcomes. Strategies for leveraging were absent, and only a few tactics were identified. Leverage could come from augmented exposure via amplified media, celebrations, further demonstrations of the sport, and teaching about the sport. A key constraint is identifying who should be responsible for implementing and executing the leveraging strategy and tactics. The findings inform various stakeholders – event organizers, sport organizations, and local communities, to find ways to use events as a lever for sport participation by making it a part of their overall marketing efforts...|$|R
