40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 27 - 30, 1997 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaThe vast {{majority}} of all utility power quality problems consist of short duration surges, sags, and momentary power losses that wreak havoc among modern sensitive loads. To solve these power quality problems, a highly reliable, low-cost battery solution, the AC Battery PQ 2000, developed with Department of Energy and Sandia National <b>Laboratories</b> <b>assistance,</b> is now available to eliminate these short duration power quality problems. Incorporated in this system is a communications interface which allows remote access over the telephone network using RS- 232 protocol. The system is designed for standalone function without an operator present; however, because of the limited experience of utilities {{in the use of}} this type of battery energy storage system, capabilities have been incorporated to allow for datalogging and remote system control of the unit. This paper reviews power quality problems, outlines the system design philosophy from AC Battery Corporation, discusses the rationale for remote telemetering system design, and reviews the utility of this telemetry through the experience of a system installed in Georgia...|$|R
