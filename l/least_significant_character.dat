That is then split that into upper and lower 5-bit parts, 00100 and 10010. Then append 01 binary to produce 7-bit numbers 0100100 and 0110010.

40|$|Abstract — Steganography {{is the art}} or {{practice}} of concealing a message, image, or file within another message, image, or file. In steganography, there is a technique in which the <b>least</b> <b>significant</b> bit is modified to hide the secret message, known as the <b>least</b> <b>significant</b> bit (LSB) steganography. <b>Least</b> <b>significant</b> bit matching images are still not well detected, especially, at low embedding rate. In this paper, we have improved the <b>least</b> <b>significant</b> bit steganalyzers by analyzing and manipulating the features of some existing <b>least</b> <b>significant</b> bit matching steganalysis techniques. This paper explains the LSB Embedding technique with lifting based DWT schemes by using Micro blaze Processor implemented in a FPGA using System C coding...|$|R
5000|$|LSB {{can also}} stand for <b>least</b> <b>significant</b> byte. [...] The meaning is {{parallel}} to the above: it is the byte (or octet) in that position of a multi-byte number which has the least potential value. If the abbreviations meaning <b>least</b> <b>significant</b> byte isnt obvious from context, it should be stated explicitly to avoid confusion with <b>least</b> <b>significant</b> bit.|$|R

50|$|The {{constant}} k is {{a simple}} monochrome bitmap image of the formula treated as a binary number and multiplied by 17. If k is divided by 17, the <b>least</b> <b>significant</b> bit encodes the upper-right corner (k, 0); the 17 <b>least</b> <b>significant</b> bits encode the rightmost column of pixels; the next 17 <b>least</b> <b>significant</b> bits encode the 2nd-rightmost column, and so on.|$|R

50|$|Multiple column sorting was {{commonly}} done {{by first}} sorting the <b>least</b> <b>significant</b> column, then proceeding, column by column, {{to the most}} significant column. This is called a <b>least</b> <b>significant</b> digit radix sort.|$|R
50|$|If the <b>least</b> <b>significant</b> nibble of {{the result}} is 10 or higher, then the {{processor}} adds 6 to it and discards any overflow of the nibble, and stores it in the <b>least</b> <b>significant</b> byte.|$|R
40|$|I {{would like}} to take this {{opportunity}} to thank my supervisor, Dr Ron Poet, for his time and assistance. The objective of this project was to implement several different steganography algorithms with an aim to provide a basis for comparison in terms of effectiveness and hiding capacity. Effectiveness of the algorithms was measured by user evaluations determining at which point alteration to the images became apparent. The algorithms implemented were the <b>least</b> <b>significant</b> bit, two <b>least</b> <b>significant</b> bits, four <b>least</b> <b>significant</b> bits and the Bit Plane Complexity Segmentation (BPCS) algorithms. The most noteworthy algorithm implemented was the BPCS algorithm as devised by Kawaguchi et al (1998). This dissertation also discusses the implementation of this algorithm, which was not covered in the papers written by the authors of the technique. The outcome of the project showed that the two lower capacity algorithms (<b>least</b> <b>significant</b> bit and two <b>least</b> <b>significant</b> bits) were highly effective. The four <b>least</b> <b>significant</b> bits algorithm, when tested to the maximum capacity was ineffective. The claim made by Kawaguchi et a...|$|R
