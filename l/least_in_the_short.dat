In 217 BC, near the beginning of the Second Punic War, Rome was forced to effectively ignore its long-standing principle that its soldiers must be both citizens and property owners. During the 2nd century BC, Roman territory saw an overall decline in population, partially due to the huge losses incurred during various wars. This was accompanied by severe social stresses and the greater collapse of the middle classes. As a result, the Roman state was forced to arm its soldiers {{at the expense of the}} state, which it did not have to do in the past.|$|E

5|$|The {{extraordinary}} {{demands of}} the Punic Wars, {{in addition to a}} shortage of manpower, exposed the tactical weaknesses of the manipular legion, at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> term. In 217BC, Rome was forced to effectively ignore its long-standing principle that its soldiers must be both citizens and property owners when slaves were pressed into naval service; around 213BC, the property requirement was reduced from 11,000 to 4,000 asses. Since the Romans are unlikely to have preferred to employ slaves over poor citizens in their armies, it must be assumed that, at this point, the proletarii of the poorest citizens must also have been pressed into service despite their lack of legal qualification. By 123BC, the financial requirement for military service was slashed again from 4,000 asses to just 1,500 asses. By this time, therefore, it is clear that many of the property-less former proletarii had been nominally admitted into the adsidui.|$|E
5|$|To {{the east}} of Europe lay the Byzantine Empire, {{composed}} of Christians who had long followed a separate Orthodox rite; the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches had been in schism since 1054. Historians {{have argued that the}} desire to impose Roman church authority in the east may {{have been one of the}} goals of the crusade, although Urban II, who launched the First Crusade, never refers to such a goal in his letters on crusading. The Seljuq Turks had taken over almost all of Anatolia after the Byzantine defeat at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071; however, their conquests were piecemeal and led by semi-independent warlords, rather than by the sultan. A dramatic collapse of the empire's position on the eve of the Council of Clermont brought Byzantium to the brink of disaster. By the mid-1090s, the Byzantine Empire was largely confined to Balkan Europe and the northwestern fringe of Anatolia, and faced Norman enemies in the west as well as Turks in the east. In response to the defeat at Manzikert and subsequent Byzantine losses in Anatolia in 1074, Pope Gregory VII had called for the milites Christi ("soldiers of Christ") to go to Byzantium's aid. This call was largely ignored and even opposed. The reason for this was that while the defeat at Manzikert was shocking, it had limited significance and did not lead to major difficulties for the Byzantine empire, at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> term.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was {{determine}} whether bonding of glass-ionomer cements to non-carious dentine differed from that to carious dentine. Five commercial cements were used, namely Fuji IX GP, Fuji IX capsulated, Fuji IX Fast capsulated (all GC, Japan), Ketac-Molar and Ketac-Molar Aplicap (both 3 M-ESPE, Germany). Following conditioning of the substrate with 10 % poly (acrylic acid) for 10 s, sets of 10 samples of the cements were bonded to prepared teeth that had been removed for orthodontic reasons. The teeth used had either sound dentine or sclerotic dentine. Shear bond strengths were determined following 24 h storage. For the auto-mixed cements, shear bond strength to sound dentine was found not to differ statistically from shear bond strength to sclerotic dentine whereas for hand-mixed cements, shear bond to sound dentine was found to be higher than to carious dentine (to at least p < 0. 05). This shows that the chemical effects arising from interactions of glass-ionomer cements with the mineral phase of the tooth are <b>the</b> most important <b>in</b> developing strong bonds, at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shorter</b> term...|$|R
