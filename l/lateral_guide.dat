5000|$|Dee-ring/ racing snaffle: ring in {{the shape}} of a [...] "D" [...] which does not allow the bit to rotate and so the bit is more fixed. The sides of the D provide a <b>lateral</b> <b>guiding</b> effect.|$|R

40|$|The use of <b>lateral</b> <b>guide</b> vanes as a drag {{reducing}} {{device for}} ground vehicles is numerically investigated {{in the present}} study. Two types of ground vehicles are considered, a simplified bus model and a simplified sport utility vehicle (SUV) model. The guide vanes are used to direct air into the low-pressure wake region {{in order to enhance}} pressure recovery, which in turn would reduce form drag and hence the overall aerodynamic drag. Computational fluid dynamics simulations are used to assess the efficiency of the drag reducing device. The steady-state simulations are based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations, with turbulence closure provided through two-equation eddy-viscosity models. Guide vane cross-section, chord length and angle of attack are varied in order to obtain the optimal configuration for improved aerodynamic performance. Simulations indicate an overall reduction in the aerodynamic drag coefficient of up to 18 % for the bus and SUV models {{with the use of the}} <b>lateral</b> <b>guide</b> vanes. Grid-independence tests and comparison with available data in the literature is carried out to validate the present numerical procedure...|$|E

50|$|Action: As {{the name}} suggests, the half-cheek {{has only a}} lower cheek, though {{occasionally}} the bit is put on upside down, with the half cheek pointing up. The cheek is generally flat and spoon-like, {{as opposed to the}} long, cylindrical shape of the full cheek. The bit provides some <b>lateral</b> <b>guiding</b> effect, and is more fixed in the mouth than the loose ring.|$|R

50|$|Action: The fulmer {{is similar}} to the full cheek in that it has an upper and lower cheek, which taper off as they move from the mouthpiece. However, the ring to which the bit is {{attached}} is not an eggbutt or Dee-ring design, but a loose ring. This bit therefore gives the <b>lateral</b> <b>guiding</b> effect of the full-cheek, without the rigidity of many other bit rings.|$|R

The cheeks have a <b>lateral</b> <b>guiding</b> effect, and also prevent the bit from sliding through the mouth. The full cheek is often used with bit keepers to prevent the cheeks from getting caught on anything, and to keep the bit in the right position inside the mouth.|$|R

40|$|A guide-antiguide {{modulator}} of GaAs-AlGaAs {{using the}} electric-field-induced waveguide concept was demonstrated. The device was formed {{with a central}} waveguide electrode sandwiched between two antiguide electrodes {{on the surface of}} a p-i-n multiple quantum well (MQW). Switching between <b>lateral</b> <b>guiding</b> and antiguiding was accomplished by reverse biasing either the central electrode or the adjacent electrodes to increase the index beneath these respective regions.

50|$|Action: The cheeks {{of these}} bits extend both upward and downward, {{tapering}} {{as they get}} {{farther away from the}} mouthpiece, with a half-moon ring similar in shape to the Dee-ring or eggbutt (depending on the design). The long sides provide a great deal of <b>lateral</b> <b>guiding</b> effect. The full cheek without bit keepers is more fixed in the mouth than a loose ring, and thus has a similar action to the eggbutt or Dee-ring. Use of bit keepers, however, makes the full cheek even more fixed than the Dee-ring, concentrating bit pressure on the bars and tongue.|$|R
5000|$|Action: the Dee-ring, as {{its name}} suggest, has a ring shape like a [...] "D" [...] with the cheek side of the [...] "D" [...] {{attached}} to the mouthpiece of the bit. The straight bars of the Dee-ring provide a slight <b>lateral</b> <b>guiding</b> effect. This is because the bit ring is pulled {{against the side of}} the mouth opposite the rein that is activated, pushing the sides of the Dee against the horse's mouth, encouraging a turn. The Dee-ring is fixed in the horse's mouth, because its shape does not allow the bit to rotate. The Dee-ring is most similar to the full cheek.|$|R
40|$|A {{physical}} {{explanation of}} the <b>lateral</b> <b>guiding</b> mechanism in channeled-substrate-planar (CSP) lasers based {{on the amount of}} wavefront tilt of the transverse field outside the channel region is presented. Because of this inherent wavefront tilt, all CSP lasers will have a very slight asymmetry in their transverse far-field pattern. The nature of the guiding mechanism does not require light absorption by the substrate. Design curves showing the complex lateral effective index step as a function of n-clad thickness with the active layer as a parameter are also presented. Depending on the specific layer compositions and thicknesses, the CSP guiding mechanism can provide a positive lateral index step for substrates with mole fractions of AlAs ranging from 0 to higher than 0. 2...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{investigation of}} ballistic electron transport in a quantum wire with soft wall confinement is presented. A general method {{of the electron}} transmission calculation is proposed for structures with complicated geometries. The effects of the <b>lateral</b> <b>guiding</b> potential on ballistic transport are investigated using three soft wall confinement models {{and the results are}} compared with those obtained from the hard wall confinement approximation. It is shown that the calculated transmission coefficients are notably dependent on the lateral confining potential especially when the incident electron energy is larger than the energy of the second transverse mode. It is found that the transmission profile obtained from soft wall confinement models exhibits simpler resonance structures than that obtained from the hard wall confinement approximation. Our results suggest that only in the single-channel regime the hard wall confinement approximation can give reasonable results...|$|R
40|$|A novel design {{technique}} for low-loss waveguide crossing using the self-imaging properties of multimode interference (MMI) structures is presented. The technique exploits {{the observation that}} optical fields with a small lie width relative {{to that of the}} MMI structure in the image reformed region experience negligible propagation loss {{even in the absence of}} <b>lateral</b> <b>guiding</b> mechanism around the region. This allows the introduction of a slab in the MMI region. The technique could also be used to design planar light-wave circuits with small wavelength-dependent loss which is important for DWDM devices. Using two-dimensional wide-angle BPM simulations, taper width technology and MMI structure technology is compared for low-loss slab propagation in orthogonal intersection. We also demonstrate that low-loss crossing waveguides with intersection angle as small as 23 ° can be achieved with the aid of MMI structures.

40|$|Abstract- This paper discuses sensor {{steering}} mechanism (SSM) for a laterally guided vehicle with a rear wheel {{steering mechanism}}. The authors {{have demonstrated the}} geometry of SSMs for front wheel steering type and reverse phase four-wheel steering type vehicles. SSMs allow stable <b>lateral</b> <b>guiding</b> performance for automated vehicles following a path with straight and curved portions created by a guideway. On other hand, no SSM has been established for a rear wheel steering type vehicle. Rear wheel steering vehicles include forklifts and backward moving conventional motor vehicles which are front wheel vehicles. A SSM for rear wheel steering vehicles would enable a forklift to move into any spaces using automation. This paper proposes a SSM relation for a rear wheel steering vehicle and describes the construction of experimental robotic vehicle with the proposed SSM. Simulated and an experimental data show {{the advantages of the}} proposed SSM...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was to {{establish}} a correlation between occlusion, Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) pain and idiopathic scoliosis. The study population was composed of 120 patients affected by idiopathic scoliosis and admitted for orthodontic evaluation and treatment between January 2008 and December 2009. Several variables were investigated: demographic (age and gender), TMJ symptoms (left and right pain) anatomic (left and right cuspid and molar tooth classes, overbite and overjet, anterior and posterior left and right emanel surface lesions, anterior and posterior left and right cross-bites) and functional (frontal and left and right <b>lateral</b> <b>guides</b> for disclosure, left and right initial, intermediate, final and reciprocal clicks) variables. By matching TMJ pain and all the other variables, only occlusal functional variables and most severe scoliosis have a significant correlation with TMJ pain. Patients affected by idiopathic scoliosis have a high incidence of malocclusion. Occlusal functional variables and degree of scoliosis have a clinical impact on TMJ symptom...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the characteristics of}} parabolic bow-tie laser arrays (PBTLAs) which are a novel category of laser diodes specially designed to achieve high power with high brightness at 980 nm. Output powers in excess of 2. 8 W/facet have been measured from five-element PBTLAs with output beam less than twice the diffraction limit, achieving high brightness of 275 MWcm/sup - 2 /srad/sup - 1 / at 3 A (pulsed) injection current (= 22 times the threshold). Changes in the achievable brightness due {{to changes in the}} optical cavity geometry and in the <b>lateral</b> optical <b>guiding</b> strength are discussed in detail, using the coupled-mode theory to interpret the experimental results. At threshold all devices operate in the highest (double lobed) array mode. At higher currents the arrays of tapered lasers change to quasi-in-phase operation when the modal gain of the fundamental array mode dominates because of the combined effect of carrier hole burning and spatial filtering from the narrow stripe central section of the device. Similar trends have been observed under continuous-wave operation. The reduction of <b>lateral</b> optical <b>guiding</b> strength is deleterious for the operational characteristics of PBTLAs and linear bow-tie arrays, and it leads to filamentation in gain-guided devices even at low currents. Theoretical results presented in this paper show that scalability is in principle possible; however, changes in the lateral gain profile due to hole-burning can significantly increase the modal gain of higher order modes and, therefore, strongly influence the optical output profile...|$|R

40|$|A new {{structure}} to utilize intersubband absorption based on GaAs Inversion Channel technology is proposed. A GaAs CCD structure enables a two dimensional infrared imager. The existing QWIP technology utilizes {{a series of}} about 40 quantum wells with the dark current determined by thermionic current over the quantum well barrier. The proposed {{new structure}} has one or two quantum wells with dark current limited by the recombination current in the AlGaAs barrier layers. A grating structure as an illumination coupler may {{be incorporated into the}} device fabrication sequence to enable the detection of normally incident light. It has been shown that the coupling efficiency maximum occurred when it satisfied the second order Bragg diffraction condition i. e., the pitch size of the grating is half the wavelength. This would allow the normal radiation to be diffracted into the <b>lateral</b> <b>guided</b> waves. A resonant cavity structure is also employed to enhance the absorption to compensate for the reduced number of quantum wells in the new structure. The corresponding reflective spectrum as a function of device thickness was simulated using the TMM Method. In addition, an intersubband absorption model was developed using effective mass, non-parabolicity effects and the redistribution of the density of states in a high field to accurately explain the peak positions of responsivity as a function of temperature in previously published data. To optimize the ICT-QWIP, a model based upon Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s equation, which utilized established electron and hole current flow relations, was developed for electrically and optically biased situations. The quantum well 2 ̆ 7 s vacancy as a measure of infrared signal level was found to be approximately proportional to the incident optical flux. The solutions in steady state were then used as the boundary values to study the time dependent situations. The on/off time responses of the detectors were explained by the electron dynamics between the charge sheet and quantum wells. Finally, the device fabrication and preliminary testing results are presented. ...|$|R

40|$|Highly {{multimode}} waveguides {{in which}} multiple image	of the input excitation are formed at different distances along the guide {{can be used}} for splitting and switching applications. The e devices are often analyzed with a paraxial approximation. In the analysis presented here, an effective index dielectric slab waveguide model is implemented to account for the actual shapes and propagation constants of the modes. The analysis was performed on lxN splitters with a centered input, NxM couplers with off-center inputs, and NxMxl cascaded combinations of couplers and combiner. The sensitivity of the output intensity of the devices to changes in longitudinal output <b>guide</b> position, <b>lateral</b> input <b>guide</b> position, multimode width, input wavelength, and input phase were all investigated. The sensitivity curves demonstrate that higher output efficiencies are possible than with the typical paraxial approximation.

40|$|A 22 -year-old female {{had been}} {{suffering}} from sciatica-like pain in the left leg for four years. Clinical findings strongly directed further investigations to the popliteal fossa.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Instrumentation of {{the spine}} depends on {{choosing}} the correct insertion angles to implant screws. Although modern image guidance facilitates precise instrumentation {{of the spine}}, the equipment is costly and availability is limited. Although most surgeons use <b>lateral</b> fluoroscopy to <b>guide</b> instrumentation in the sagittal plane, the lateromedial angulation is often chosen by estimation. To overcome the associated uncertainty, iPod touch–based applications for measuring angles {{can be used to}} assist with screw implantation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of the iPod touch to adjust instruments to the optimal axial insertion angle for placement of pedicle screws in the lumbar spine. METHODS: Twenty lumbar pedicle screws in 5 consecutive patients were implanted using the iPod touch. The lateromedial angulation was measured on preoperative images and reproduced in the operative field with the iPod touch. The instruments to implant the screws were aligned with the side of the iPod for screw insertion. Actual screw angles were remeasured on postoperative imaging. We collected demographic, clinical, and operative data for each patient. RESULTS: In 16 of 20 screws, the accuracy of implantation was within 3 degrees of the ideal trajectory. The 4 screws with an angle mismatch of 7 to 13 degrees were all implanted at the caudal end of the exposure, where maintaining the planned angulation was impeded by strong muscles pushing medially. CONCLUSION: iPod touch–assisted instrumentation of the spine is a very simple technique, which, in combination with a <b>lateral</b> fluoroscopy, may <b>guide</b> placement of pedicle screws in the lumbar spine...|$|R
