2500|$|Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{provided}} a favorable review, opining {{that the great}} thing about the album are the producers and songwriters who are willing to play with the group's [...] "hyper-sexual image, creating a sleek, sexy sound ideal for both nightclubs and strip joints." [...] However he did go on to criticize the albums's ballad's. Slant Magazine writer Sal Cinquemani felt that if [...] "the Pussycat Dolls really want to make their mark in the giant <b>litter</b> <b>box</b> that is popular music today, they need more of the big band burlesque of 'Right Now' and less of Diane Warren." [...] In his consumer guide for MSN Music, Robert Christgau gave the album a [...] "one-star honorable mention", commenting that the group is [...] "sexier than your average prefab sexpots, but no fabber." [...] Elysa Gardner of USA Today wrote that despite their superficiality and [...] "insipid lyrics" [...] acknowledged that [...] "lead singer Nicole Scherzinger and {{at least a couple of}} her fellow Dolls have supple voices." ...|$|E

[...] Stephen Holden of The New York Times gave the film three and a half stars out of five, saying [...] "It is a cheerfully chaotic jumble of fairy tale and nursery rhyme characters parachuted into a Spanish storybook setting." [...] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Basically, this toon is a tired riff on Sergio Leone's spaghetti Westerns, punctuated by more puns and cat jokes than you can shake a <b>litter</b> <b>box</b> at." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "With his impeccable comic timing and lyrical Spanish accent, Banderas' swashbuckling charmer is an undeniable treat." [...] Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "Puss in Boots" [...] proves {{there is at least one}} cat with multiple lives. The feature-length animated spinoff - a star turn for the popular [...] "Shrek" [...] supporting character voiced by Antonio Banderas - is almost shockingly good. And not just because a lot of you will approach it with lowered expectations." [...] Stephen Whitty of the Newark Star-Ledger gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "An almost purr-fect little film that even a dog owner can enjoy." ...|$|E

50|$|Cats may {{be easily}} trained {{to use a}} kitty <b>litter</b> <b>box</b> or tray, as this is natural behavior. Many cats and kittens will instinctively use a <b>litter</b> <b>box</b> without needing to be taught, because of their {{instincts}} to expel bodily waste in dirt or sand. Therefore, with a new kitten, owners usually need to simply show the kitten where the <b>litter</b> <b>box</b> is located, {{and how to get}} in and out. On occasion, some training is required to help a new cat adjust to a <b>litter</b> <b>box,</b> or to help an older cat that suddenly stops using the <b>litter</b> <b>box.</b>|$|E
50|$|Regardless of cause, {{there is}} a common set of symptoms, which {{includes}} frequent trips to the <b>litter</b> <b>box</b> (pollakiuria), prolonged squatting and straining during attempts to urinate (dysuria), small amounts of urine voided in each attempt, blood in the urine (hematuria) and urinating outside of the <b>litter</b> <b>box.</b> Owners with outdoor cats {{may not be able to}} observe the symptoms associated with <b>litter</b> <b>box</b> use and should watch for unusual behavioral changes.|$|E

25|$|Cat litter {{is one of}} any of {{a number}} of {{materials}} used in <b>litter</b> <b>boxes</b> to absorb moisture from cat feces and urine, which reduces foul odors such as ammonia and renders them more tolerable within the home.

25|$|Furthermore, {{pregnant}} or immunocompromised {{people are at}} higher risk of becoming infected or transmitting the parasite to their fetus.

50|$|As with dogs, a cat's anal glands can spontaneously empty, {{especially}} under {{times of}} stress, {{and create a}} very sudden unpleasant change in the odor of the cat. A cat's glands may become impacted, causing the cat to defecate outside the <b>litter</b> <b>box,</b> almost anywhere in the house. A veterinarian can empty the clogged glands, and defecating outside the <b>litter</b> <b>box</b> will stop immediately in most cases. Often this problem is incorrectly interpreted as behavioral, when it is entirely a problem of clogged or blocked anal glands or difficulty defecating.|$|E

500|$|As {{a nonprofit}} shelter, the Refuge is run mainly by volunteers who clean <b>litter</b> <b>boxes,</b> change food and water, wash dishes and blankets, {{sanitize}} areas and perform other duties. There are two shifts {{of at least}} two volunteers each, early morning and late afternoon, which revolve around the feeding habits of the cats. The volunteers also need to socialize new kittens and cats with behavior issues to make them ready for adoption. New volunteers are introduced to the cats who need to receive special attention for conditions such as allergies to certain cleaning products and dietary restrictions, which are made clear by charts and signs on the cats' cages.|$|R
5|$|Other common {{household}} {{substances that}} should be used with caution around cats include mothballs and other naphthalene products. Phenol-based products (e.g. Pine-Sol, Dettol/Lysol or hexachlorophene) are often used for cleaning and disinfecting near cats' feeding areas or <b>litter</b> <b>boxes,</b> but these can sometimes be fatal. Ethylene glycol, often used as an automotive antifreeze, is particularly appealing to cats, and {{as little as a}} teaspoonful can be fatal. Some human foods are toxic to cats; for example chocolate can cause theobromine poisoning, although (unlike dogs) few cats will eat chocolate. Large amounts of onions or garlic are also poisonous to cats. Many houseplants are also dangerous, such as Philodendron species and the leaves of the Easter lily (Lilium longiflorum), which can cause permanent and life-threatening kidney damage.|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to such obvious dangers as insecticides and weed killers, other common household substances {{that should be}} used with caution in areas where cats may be exposed to them include mothballs and other naphthalene products, as well as phenol based products often used for cleaning and disinfecting near cats' feeding areas or <b>litter</b> <b>boxes,</b> such as Pine-Sol, Dettol (Lysol), hexachlorophene, etc. which, although they are widely used without problem, have been sometimes seen to be fatal. Ethylene glycol, often used as an automotive antifreeze, is particularly appealing to cats, and {{as little as a}} teaspoonful can be fatal. Essential oils are toxic to cats and there have been reported cases of serious illnesses caused by tea tree oil, and tea tree oil-based flea treatments and shampoos.|$|R

40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} to determine the occurrence of risk factors for Toxoplasma gondii infection amongst farmers in Thika District, Kenya. Interviews were conducted {{in a total of}} 385 households using a structured questionnaire. The water consumed at household level originated from taps (74. 3 %), rivers or streams (15. 1 %), wells (5. 4 %) and boreholes (5. 2 %). A number of households (46. 8 %) consumed water without boiling or applying any form of treatment. All respondents washed vegetables before cooking, whilst 99. 0 % washed fruits before eating. Boiled milk was preferred by 99. 5 % of the farmers. The majority (85. 2 %) consumed beef more often, whilst 1. 6 % consumed pork. The majority (98. 7 %) consumed thoroughly cooked meat. Meat was preserved by 17 % of farmers. Only four farmers (1. 2 %) who practised mixed farming used gloves when handling livestock manure. Five farmers (1. 6 %) reported the occurrence of abortion in ruminants and pigs on their farms within the last two years before the study. Almost half (44. 9 %) of the households owned cats, which were kept mainly as pets (79. 8 %) and for deterring rodents (20. 2 %). The majority of households (91. 3 %) fed the cats on leftovers, whilst 8. 1 % fed cats with raw offal. Sixteen households (9. 2 %) provided housing for cats. Only five households (2. 8 %) had <b>litter</b> <b>boxes,</b> but none of the households with <b>litter</b> <b>boxes</b> used gloves when cleaning them out. Disposal of cat faeces was done mainly by women (55. 5 %). Only one farmer (0. 3 %) had some knowledge about toxoplasmosis, but was not aware of the transmission mechanism. The study highlights the need for public health education to raise awareness of risk factors for toxoplasmosis. </p...|$|R
