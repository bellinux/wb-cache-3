25|$|Episode four: Chris and Tracey - Tracey and Chris {{have been}} married {{just over a year}} and were very much in love. But even though they were very happy together, they feel under {{constant}} pressure from others around them, because Tracey is forty-two and her husband Chris is just twenty-four. With an eighteen-year age gap, Chris is often mistaken for Tracey's son. Woodall and Susannah see that both their wardrobes needed revamping and modernising which will help the couple bridge their age gap. Tracey and Chris hope that by dressing differently they might begin to look more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> and be more accepted together. Constantine helps Tracey to overcome her body insecurities by investing in some good items that will emphasize her good figure. As a result of a new appearance, Tracey begins to feel more glamorous. The pair are given a new look and are once again reunited.|$|E
500|$|Geoffrey Rush as Captain Hector Barbossa: Once {{first mate}} of the Black Pearl under Jack's command before leading a mutiny, Barbossa has been resurrected by Tia Dalma to captain {{the rescue of}} Jack Sparrow. He was also needed for his [...] "piece of eight" [...] to free Calypso. Rush {{said that in the}} film, Barbossa becomes more of a cunning politician. Depp said he was pleased he got more screentime with Rush than in the first film: [...] "We're <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of old ladies {{fighting}} over their knitting needles".|$|E
500|$|The storyline {{contains}} minor {{scenes from}} Crichton's Jurassic Park and The Lost World novels that were ultimately not {{featured in the}} film versions, such as the Pteranodon aviary {{and the use of}} the boat. Laura Dern's cameo was shot in a day. In an earlier draft, Neill and Dern's characters were a couple in the process of splitting up. Johnston said, [...] "I didn't want to see them as a couple anymore. For one thing, I don't think they look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple.</b> It would be uncomfortable to still see them together. And Laura Dern doesn't look like she's aged for the past fifteen years!" [...] The film's longest rough cut was approximately 96 minutes, without credits. According to Johnston, [...] "We lost maybe 8 minutes, so it was never really that long." ...|$|E

5000|$|After {{completing}} {{what would}} be her final novel, The Street, Bishop was informed that her condition was terminal. [...] "All the energy went out of me at that point and I felt dreadfully poor and sad and I haven’t written since," [...] {{she said in a}} March 2013 interview. [...] "I {{would have liked to have}} had a few more years. I would have <b>liked</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> more novels." ...|$|R
50|$|The main objection, however, {{was that}} it was not an {{automatic}} brake, i.e. even <b>a</b> minor mishap <b>like</b> <b>a</b> broken <b>coupling</b> left the entire train without any brake power at all.|$|R
500|$|On 27 September 1867 committal {{proceedings}} {{were heard}} {{in front of}} a magistrate to establish whether there was a prima facie case against the 28accused. The team of defence barristers included Chartist leader Ernest Jones, who had spent two years in prison for making seditious speeches, and W. P. Roberts, whose fee was paid by subscribers to a defence fund to represent nine of the men. Jones, representing Condon and O'Brien, clashed with the court almost immediately because the accused were handcuffed, saying [...] "It appears to be discreditable to the administration of justice that men whom the law presumes to be innocent should be brought into Court handcuffed together <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of hounds." [...] Jones also objected to the presence of a number of soldiers in the courtroom, and when the magistrate refused to order the prisoners' handcuffs to be removed he [...] "marched dramatically" [...] out of the courtroom saying [...] "Then {{as a member of the}} Bar I decline to sit in any Court where the police override the Magistrate... I cannot disgrace the Bar by proceeding with the defence." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Used to Love You" [...] {{was written}} by Stefani, Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels and J.R. Rotem; Rotem {{is also one of}} the song's producers. [...] The song is a {{vulnerable}} and [...] "emotional" [...] midtempo synthpop ballad, having a [...] "driving piano melody", with a length of three minutes and forty-seven seconds. Spins James Grebey wrote that the song [...] "largely showcases her passionate, conflicted vocals over restrained, electropop-leaning swells of emotional synths and drum taps." [...] Lyrically, [...] "Used to Love You" [...] is a break-up anthem, where Stefani is questioning how she fell in love with her ex in the first place. The majority of music critics noted that the song is inspired by Stefani's divorce from Gavin Rossdale, after a 13-year marriage. In an interview for Todays Matt Lauer, Stefani confirmed that the track was inspired by the end of her marriage, claiming: [...] "I’ve never put a record out where I’m actually going through things in real time. his is like, I wrote that song <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> weeks ago." [...] According to Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone that could be seen in the lines of the chorus, [...] "I don't know why I cry / But I think it's cause I remember for the first time / Since I hated you / That I used to love you." [...] In other poignant lyrics, she sings, [...] "I guess nobody taught you, nobody taught you how to love." [...] Kreps further compared the lyrical content of [...] "Used to Love You" [...] to [...] "Dreaming the Same Dream", a song from No Doubt's sixth album Push and Shove. Alex Kritselis of Bustle claimed that the song [...] "recalls some of [...] best ballads, like 'Cool', 'Early Winter', and '4 in the Morning'." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews were mixed, and {{the camp}} tone had a mostly {{negative}} reaction. The film currently has a 67% [...] "fresh" [...] rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Connery was applauded by Kevin A. Ranson of MovieCrypt and Michael A. Smith of Nolan's Pop Culture. Critic Roger Ebert noted, {{in a positive}} review, the irrelevance of the plot and [...] "moments of silliness", such as Bond finding himself driving a moon buggy with antennae revolving and robot arms flapping. He praised the Las Vegas car chase scene, particularly the segment when Bond drives the Mustang on two wheels. Twenty-five years after its release, James Berardinelli criticised {{the concept of a}} laser-shooting satellite and the performances of Jill St. John, Norman Burton and Jimmy Dean. Christopher Null called St. John [...] "one of the least effective Bond girls – beautiful, but shrill and helpless". Steve Rhodes said, [...] "looking and acting <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of pseudo-country bumpkins, they (Putter Smith and Bruce Glover) seem to have wandered by accident from the adjoining sound stage into the filming of this movie." [...] But he also extolled the car chase as [...] "classic". According to Danny Peary, Diamonds are Forever is [...] "one of the most forgettable movies of the entire Bond series" [...] and that [...] "until Blofeld's reappearance we must watch what is no better than a mundane diamond-smuggling melodrama, without the spectacle we associate with James Bond: the Las Vegas setting isn't exotic enough, there's little humour, assassins Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint are similar to characters you'd find on The Avengers, but not nearly as amusing – and the trouble Bond gets into, even Maxwell Smart could escape." [...] IGN chose it as the third worst James Bond film, behind only The Man with the Golden Gun and Die Another Day. Total Film listed Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd, and Bambi and Thumper, as the first and second worst villains in the Bond series (respectively). The film was more positively received by Xan Brooks of the Guardian, who said it was [...] "oddly brilliant, the best of the bunch: the perfect bleary Bond film for an imperfect bleary western world." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Davidson's first {{autobiography}} The Full Monty (1993), {{he talked}} about his violent and abusive behaviour towards his wife in a light-hearted manner: [...] "We’re <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of boxers. On the first occasion, I poked her in the eye by accident. I actually went for the mouth. Thank heaven I missed, I’d have fallen in. I just took a playful punch. Unfortunately I caught her completely wrong. The second time I gave her a shiner. I threw a bunch of keys which whacked her in the eye. Just for a giggle she kept blackening it up to make it look worse." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{cohabitation}} agreement {{is a form}} of legal agreement reached between <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> who have chosen to live together (whether they are heterosexual or homosexual).

I feel very lucky and privileged to be given the opportunity [...] " [...] Grey has various tattoos on his body, each seeming having a specific story, including Gilliam's name tattooed on the heart side of his chest. After the film's release Bong revealed background information, [...] "There are homosexual relationships among the men. Gilliam and Grey seem <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> with a large age gap. Gilliam is someone whom Grey admires deeply, of course, but one could imagine they sleep together too. And Gilliam sends Grey to Curtis." ...|$|E
2500|$|If {{you were}} given three words {{to sum up}} the cricket career of Graham Yallop... what would you say? Australia's Lousiest Captain? Solid And Reliable? Dodgy Against Pace? A Bit Boring? There is a dollop of truth in them all. Yallop could be dull; if Dean Jones set the pulses of Melbourne grandmothers racing <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of shandies over lunch, then Yallop was the comforting mug of Milo who put them back to sleep. He was decidedly more at home when the spinners were on. He was also, {{especially}} at his 1983 peak, the epitome of rocklike solidity. And yes, he was a fatally flawed, forlorn captain... He was unimaginative, tactically unsophisticated and lacked the respect of his players. And because he had predicted they would win 6–0, in the dumbest press conference any Australian captain ever gave... More than anyone, Yallop suffered from the chaos of ... He was used and abused at every turn. He {{is not the only}} Australian batsman of the last 25 years to have been mistreated by selectors... But Yallop was the first, and arguably copped the rawest deal, of them all.... Graham Yallop in three words? Unlucky Uncelebrated Unmissed seem to fit best, more's the pity.|$|E
2500|$|By New Year 1924, Bow {{defied the}} possessive Maxine Alton {{and brought her}} father to Hollywood. Bow remembered their reunion: [...] "I didn't care a rap, for (Maxine Alton), or B. P. Schulberg, or my motion picture career, or Clara Bow, I just threw myself {{into his arms and}} kissed and kissed him, and we both cried <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of fool kids. Oh, it was wonderful." [...] Bow felt Alton had misused her trust: [...] "She wanted to keep a hold on me so she made me think I wasn't getting over and that nothing but her clever {{management}} kept me going." [...] Bow and her father moved in at 1714 North Kingsley Drive in Hollywood, together with Jacobson, who by then also worked for Preferred. When Schulberg learned of this arrangement, he fired Jacobson for potentially getting [...] "his big star" [...] into a scandal. When Bow found out, [...] "She tore up her contract and threw it in his face and told him he couldn't run her private life." [...] Jacobson concluded, [...] " [...] was the sweetest girl in the world, but you didn't cross her and you didn't do her wrong." [...] On September 7, 1924, The Los Angeles Times, in a significant article [...] "A dangerous little devil is Clara, impish, appealing, but oh, how she can act!", her father is titled [...] "business manager" [...] and Jacobson referred to as her brother.|$|E

40|$|Limit {{behaviors}} of some boundary value problems with high and/or low valued parameters Salima Hassani∗, Serge Nicaise†, Abderrahman Maghnouji‡ The first {{aim of this}} paper is to give a general variational framework for bilinear forms depending on two parameters tending to zero and to infinity respectively and allowing to analyze the three limit problems. Secondly we give different illustrative applications for transmission problems involving some elasticity systems, diffusion problems and Maxwell systems where one parameter tends to infinity and/or a part of the domain squeezes to a smooth surface. These limit procedures lead to new transmission problems, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>coupling</b> between the Lamé system and the Stokes system. ...|$|R
