40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to: (1) provide normative data for the Erozovich-Hall Watson (BHW) scale, a non-verbal method of assessing cognitive style; (2) provide data for itwm revision and further refinement of the BHW; and (3) assess the effects of grade <b>level</b> (age), sex <b>and</b> socioeconomic status on cognitive style. The BHW was administered to 621 children ranging in grade level from preschoolers less than 4 1 / 2 years old to third <b>graders.</b> Socioeconomic <b>level</b> <b>and</b> sex were balanced at each grade level. Grade level proved the most consistent and powerful factor related to cognitive style. Results were generally consistent with previous research, indicating, for example, a decrease in use of color as a grouping category with increased grade <b>level.</b> Sex <b>and</b> socioeconomic <b>level</b> interacted significantly with grade level in their effects related to cognitive style, but neither produced consistent effect...|$|R

40|$|This study tested {{whether the}} gender {{intensification}} hypothesis applies to relations between multiple domain-specific self-concept facets and self-esteem. This hypothesis predicts gender-stereotypic differences in these relations and assumes they intensify with age. Furthermore, knowledge about gender-related or age-related differences in self-concept-self-esteem relations might provide valuable knowledge for designing effective self-esteem enhancement interventions. We investigated grade and {{gender differences in}} the relations between domain-specific self-concept facets and self-esteem within a sample of 1958 German students in Grades 3 to 6. Results indicated no difference in the self-concept - self-esteem relations between the subsamples of third <b>and</b> fourth <b>graders</b> <b>and</b> fifth <b>and</b> sixth <b>graders</b> or between boys and girls. These relations also did not differ between boys and girls in the subsamples of third <b>and</b> fourth <b>graders</b> <b>and</b> fifth <b>and</b> sixth <b>graders.</b> These results suggest self-concept-self-esteem relations to be invariant across grade <b>levels</b> <b>and</b> gender and thus did not support the gender intensification hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|Five {{experiments}} (conducted in 1968 on observing {{responses and}} vigilance, reward preterences, and learning strategies in concept formation) indicate that socioeconomic level (SEL) has {{an influence on}} intellectual and educational functioning of elementary school children. Expectation of reinforcement was tested in experiment 1, using 60 kindergartners. Low SEL children rapidly stopped making observing responses when an expected event did not occur, while high SEL children maintained a significant rate of observing responses. In experiment 2, 32 second <b>graders</b> <b>and</b> 24 fourth <b>graders</b> were tested to investigate left-right directional preference. Fourth <b>graders</b> <b>and</b> high SEL second graders performed with more directional responses than did low SEL second <b>graders.</b> Reward preferences <b>and</b> reinforcement were investigated in 60 kindergartners in experiment 3. Low SEL children had significantly greater preference for consistency than high SEL children. Experiment 5 tested 60 first <b>graders</b> <b>and</b> indicated that the chaotic reinforcement variable alone produces deterioration of performance. Comparatively, low SEL children failed to observe environmental stimuli not previously conditioned to learned responses. Furthe...|$|R
