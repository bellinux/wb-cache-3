5|$|Spermaceti, {{obtained}} {{primarily from}} the spermaceti organ, and sperm oil, obtained {{primarily from the}} blubber in the body, were much sought after by eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth century whalers. These substances found a variety of commercial applications, such as candles, soap, cosmetics, machine oil, other specialised lubricants, <b>lamp</b> <b>oil,</b> pencils, crayons, leather waterproofing, rust-proofing materials and many pharmaceutical compounds. Ambergris, a solid, waxy, flammable substance produced in the digestive system of sperm whales, was also sought as a fixative in perfumery.|$|E

5|$|Certain occupations were {{traditionally}} {{reserved for}} women, {{while they were}} also exempted from corvée labor duties. Women were expected to rear children, weave clothes for the family, and perform domestic duties such as cooking; although farming was considered men's work, sometimes women tilled fields alongside their husbands and brothers. Some women formed communal spinning and weaving groups to pool resources together to pay for candles, <b>lamp</b> <b>oil,</b> and heat during night and winter. A successful textile business could employ hundreds of women. Singing and dancing to entertain wealthy patrons were other common professions open for women. When a husband died, sometimes the widow became the sole supporter of her children, and thus {{had to make a}} living weaving silk cloths or making straw sandals to sell in the market. Some women also turned to the humble profession of sorcery for income. Other more fortunate women could become renowned medical physicians who provided services to the families of high officials and nobility. Some wealthy women engaged in luxury trade, such as one who frequently sold pearls to a princess. Some even aided in their husband's business decisions. Female merchants dressed in silk clothes which rivaled even female nobles' attire were considered immoral compared to the ideal woman weaver.|$|E
25|$|Cats {{that were}} caught {{drinking}} <b>lamp</b> <b>oil</b> were also {{considered to be}} bakeneko. Cats may have regularly drunk <b>lamp</b> <b>oil</b> because it was derived from fish oil. The stealing of household objects is commonly associated with many Japanese ghosts, and thus the disappearance of <b>lamp</b> <b>oil</b> when a cat was present helped to associate the cat with the supernatural.|$|E
25|$|The {{invention}} of oil refining {{led to the}} availability of kerosene as <b>lamp</b> <b>oil,</b> which has a smokeless combustion {{in contrast with the}} until then highly used whale oil. The <b>lamp</b> <b>oil</b> became known as Pennsylvania Kerosine. Due to overfishing, whale oil became rare and expensive. By this time, petroleum oil had already begun to supplant fish, whale, and vegetable oils for applications such as indoor and outdoor lighting, and transatlantic export had already begun.|$|E

50|$|An <b>oil</b> <b>lamp</b> is {{an object}} {{used to produce}} light {{continuously}} {{for a period of}} time using an oil-based fuel source. The use of <b>oil</b> <b>lamps</b> began thousands of years ago and continues to this day, although not commonly anymore. They are often associated with stories in which rubbing an <b>oil</b> <b>lamp</b> would summon a genie dwelling in it, like seen in Aladdin.|$|R
25|$|In 1847 Young had his {{attention}} called {{to a natural}} petroleum seepage in the Riddings colliery at Alfreton, Derbyshire from which he distilled a light thin oil suitable for use as <b>lamp</b> <b>oil,</b> {{at the same time}} obtaining a thicker oil suitable for lubricating machinery.|$|E

In 1848 Young set up a small business refining the crude oil.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1840s, New Bedford was {{the site}} of the first {{petroleum}} fuel refinery in the United States, as newly discovered Pennsylvania crude oil was shipped to New Bedford to be refined for <b>lamp</b> <b>oil</b> and other oil. Standard Oil would ultimately buy this refinery, located on Fish Island. Fish Island was also the site of an early experiment in coal gasification, leading to the explosion of a building.|$|E

25|$|Once ashore, {{the whale}} was quickly flensed and divided into its {{separate}} parts for various warehouses and further processing. Although the primary use for whales was meat, the entire whale {{was used in}} a variety of products including <b>lamp</b> <b>oil,</b> soaps, fertilizer, folding fans (baleen), and more. This method of whaling required a significant financial investment from rich individuals to compensate for the sizable labor force. However, whaling remained entwined with ritual and unlike their contemporary European counterparts the early Japanese coastal whalers considered whales a valuable resource and did not over-exploit local stocks.|$|E
25|$|In the Colonial era {{the energy}} {{policy of the}} United States was for free use of {{standing}} timber for heating and industry. In the 19th century, new {{emphasis was placed on}} access to coal and its use for transport, heating and industry. Whales were rendered into <b>lamp</b> <b>oil.</b> Later, coal gas was fractionated for use as lighting and town gas. Natural gas was first used in America for lighting in 1816., it has grown in importance for use in homes, industry, and power plants, but natural gas production reached its U.S. peak in 1973, and the price has risen significantly since then.|$|E
25|$|As {{kerosene}} production increased, whaling declined. The American whaling fleet, {{which had}} been steadily growing for 50 years, reached its all-time peak of 199 ships in 1858. By 1860, just two years later, the fleet had dropped to 167 ships. The Civil War cut into American whaling temporarily, but only 105 whaling ships returned to sea in 1866, the first full year of peace, and that number dwindled until only 39 American ships set out to hunt whales in 1876. Kerosene, made first from coal and oil shale, then from petroleum, had largely taken over whaling’s lucrative market in <b>lamp</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|E
50|$|During Dev Deepawali, {{houses are}} {{decorated}} with <b>oil</b> <b>lamps</b> and colored designs on their front doors.

50|$|Before the {{invention}} of electric lighting, candles and <b>oil</b> <b>lamps</b> were commonly used for illumination. In areas without electricity, they are still used routinely. Until the 20th century, candles were more common in northern Europe. In southern Europe and the Mediterranean, <b>oil</b> <b>lamps</b> predominated.|$|R
25|$|The ship got {{underway}} at 9:30am. As it {{was passing}} East 90th Street, a fire {{started in the}} Lamp Room in the forward section, possibly caused by a discarded cigarette or match. It was fueled by the straw, oily rags, and <b>lamp</b> <b>oil</b> strewn around the room. The first notice of a fire was at 10:00am; eyewitnesses claimed the initial blaze began in various locations, including a paint locker filled with flammable liquids and a cabin filled with gasoline. Captain Van Schaick was not notified until 10 minutes after the fire was discovered. A 12-year-old boy had tried to warn him earlier, but was not believed.|$|E
25|$|The {{petroleum}} discovery at the Drake Well {{in western}} Pennsylvania in 1859 caused {{a great deal}} of public excitement and investment drilling in new wells, not only in Pennsylvania, but also in Canada, where petroleum had been discovered at Oil Springs, Ontario in 1858, and southern Poland, where Ignacy Łukasiewicz had been distilling <b>lamp</b> <b>oil</b> from petroleum seeps since 1852. The increased supply of petroleum allowed oil refiners to entirely side-step the oil-from-coal patents of both Young and Gesner, and produce illuminating oil from petroleum without paying royalties to anyone. As a result, the illuminating oil industry in the United States completely switched over to petroleum in the 1860s. The petroleum-based illuminating oil was widely sold as Kerosene, and the trade name soon lost its proprietary status, and became the lower-case generic product “kerosene”. Because Gesner’s original Kerosene had been also known as “coal oil,” generic kerosene from petroleum was commonly called “coal oil” {{in some parts of the}} United States well into the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|The first {{commercial}} oil well in Canada became operational in 1858 at Oil Springs, Ontario (then Canada West). Businessman James Miller Williams dug several wells between 1855 and 1858 before discovering a rich reserve of oil four metres below ground. Williams extracted 1.5 million litres {{of crude oil}} by 1860, refining much of it into kerosene <b>lamp</b> <b>oil.</b> Williams's well became commercially viable a year before Drake's Pennsylvania operation and could be argued to be the {{first commercial}} oil well in North America. The discovery at Oil Springs touched off an oil boom which brought hundreds of speculators and workers to the area. Advances in drilling continued into 1862 when local driller Shaw reached a depth of 62 metres using the spring-pole drilling method. On January 16, 1862, after an explosion of natural gas Canada's first oil gusher came into production, shooting into the air at a recorded rate of 3,000 barrels per day. By the end of the 19th century the Russian Empire, particularly the Branobel company in Azerbaijan, had taken the lead in production.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} Chinese <b>oil</b> <b>lamps</b> are dated {{from the}} Warring States period (481-221 BC). Lamps were constructed from jade, bronze, ceramic, wood, stone, and other materials. The largest <b>oil</b> <b>lamp</b> excavated {{so far is}} one discovered in a 4th-century tomb located in modern Pingshan, Hebei.|$|R
50|$|Lamps {{appear in}} the Torah and other Jewish sources {{as a symbol of}} “lighting” the way for the righteous, the wise, and for love and other {{positive}} values. While fire was often described as being destructive, light was given a positive spiritual meaning. The <b>oil</b> <b>lamp</b> and its light were important household items, and this may explain their symbolism. <b>Oil</b> <b>lamps</b> were used for many spiritual rituals.The <b>oil</b> <b>lamp</b> and its light also became important ritualistic articles with the further development of Jewish culture and its religion.|$|R
