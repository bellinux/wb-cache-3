40|$|Abstract: An {{experimental}} {{program was}} initiated {{to investigate the}} seismic performance of built-up laced steel brace members. Quasi-static testing of twelve typical steel built-up <b>laced</b> <b>member</b> (BLM) specimens was conducted. These were designed to span a range of parameters typically encountered for such members based on fi ndings from a survey of commonly used shapes and details that have been historically used. The specimens were subdivided into groups of three different cross-sectional shapes, namely built-up I-shape section, and built-up box shapes buckling about the x or the y axis. Within each group, global and local buckling slenderness ratios had either kl/r values of 60 or 120, and b/t ratios of 8 or 16. The specifi c inelastic cyclic behavior germane to each specimen, and general observations on overall member hysteretic behavior {{as a function of}} the considered parameters, are reported. A companion paper (Lee and Bruneau 2008) investigates this observed response against predictions from analytical models, and behavior in the perspective of system performance...|$|E

50|$|In 1990, three {{original}} Paper <b>Lace</b> <b>members,</b> Philip Wright, Mick Vaughan and Chris Morris, {{were given}} the financial backing to re-record Billy Don't Be A Hero with an up-to-date sound. However, this was never released as when the Gulf War began the BBC produced a list of songs it deemed inappropriate at the time, this including Billy Don't Be A Hero.|$|R
5000|$|In August 2007, the [...] "Agadoo 206 Mix" [...] was {{released}} {{as the song}} was used in a TV ad to promote Peugeot's new 206 car. The song hit the UK charts. Black <b>Lace</b> <b>members</b> Colin Gibb and Rob Hopcraft then used the song for a special charity 'Agadoo Day'.On 20 March 2009, {{it was announced that}} the song was being released in a new version by Dene Michael from Black Lace's original lineup and new member Ian Robinson. A video for the release, titled [...] "Agadoo" [...] (Mambo 2009 remix), was directed by Bruce Jones, who played Les Battersby-Brown in television soap opera Coronation Street. He also appears in the video, along with Kevin Kennedy, who played Curly Watts in the same programme.|$|R
50|$|The term is also {{sometimes}} {{used to refer}} to a structural member commonly made using a combination of structural sections connected with diagonal <b>lacing.</b> This <b>member</b> is more correctly referred to as a laced strut or laced tie, as it normally resists axial compression (strut) or axial tension (tie); the lattice girder, like any girder, primarily resists bending.|$|R

Chaffin’s goal {{was that an}} all-women {{motorcycle}} club will set a peaceful example for the warring men’s motorcycle (1%) clubs.Through charitable activities and involvement with their communities, Leather & <b>Lace</b> MC <b>members</b> insure {{the quality of life}} for all children, their communities in which they live and work, and, increase the public’s awareness concerning motorcycles and motorcyclists.|$|R
50|$|The Lace Guild headquarters, ‘The Hollies’, {{houses the}} organization’s {{extensive}} museum collection of lace and related artefacts. Themed exhibitions of selections of lace {{from the collection}} or elsewhere are shown in the display room. These exhibitions change quarterly and {{are open to the}} public (not just <b>Lace</b> Guild <b>members)</b> on Fridays. On other days of the week and for large groups it is necessary to make an appointment before visiting. Viewing of specific items in the collection can also be arranged.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{experimental and}} numerical studies {{to determine the}} equivalent {{second moment of area}} of the uniform torsion of the two-chord steel single <b>laced</b> <b>members.</b> The members are used as poles of railway traction network gates, and steel columns of framed buildings as well. The stiffness of uniform torsion of this kind of columns allows to the determine the critical loads of the spatial stability. The experimental studies have been realized on a single - span members with rotation arrested at their ends, loaded by a torque applied at the mid-span. The relationship between angle of rotation of the considered cross-section and the torque has been determined. Appropriate numerical model was created in the ABAQUS program, based on the finite element method. A very good compatibility has been observed between experimental and numerical studies. The equivalent second moment of area of the uniform torsion for analysed members has been determined by comparing the experimental and analytical results to those obtained from differential equation of non-uniform torsion, based on Vlasov’s theory. Additionally, the parametric analyses of similar members subjected to the uniform torsion, for the richer range of cross-sections have been carried out by the means of SOFiSTiK program. The purpose of the latter was determining parametrical formulas for calculation of the second moment of area of uniform torsion...|$|R
5000|$|The Lace Guild {{publishes a}} {{quarterly}} magazine, <b>Lace,</b> [...] which <b>members</b> receive {{as part of}} their membership. The Lace Guild publishes books, especially instruction books on various laces, the development of which it also fosters through an assessment scheme. It has a large library, from which British members may borrow in person or by post, and its website includes pages with information on the history and technique of lacemaking. It organizes courses, a summer school, an annual convention, and a triennial open competition.|$|R
40|$|Out-of-plane {{behaviour}} of mortared and mortarless masonry {{walls with}} {{various forms of}} reinforcement, including unreinforced masonry as a base case is examined using a layered shell element based explicit finite element modelling method. Wall systems containing internal reinforcement, external surface reinforcement and intermittently <b>laced</b> reinforced concrete <b>members</b> and unreinforced masonry panels are considered. Masonry is modelled as a layer with macroscopic orthotropic properties; external reinforcing render, grout and reinforcing bars are modelled as distinct layers of the shell element. Predictions from the layered shell model have been validated using several out-of-plane experimental datasets reported in the literature. The model is {{used to examine the}} effectiveness of two retrofitting schemes for an unreinforced masonry wall...|$|R
40|$|Built-up columns {{are often}} used in steel {{buildings}} and bridges providing economical solutions in cases of large spans and/or heavy loads. Two main effects {{should be taken into}} account in their design that differentiate them from other structural members. One is the significant influence of shear deformations due to their reduced shear rigidity. The second is the interaction between global and local buckling. These effects are addressed here from both a numerical and an analytical point of view for laced built-up columns. It is concluded that the largest loss of capacity occurs when the local and global Euler critical stresses and the yield stress all coincide. This reduction in capacity becomes more prominent in the presence of imperfections, reaching magnitudes in the order of 50 %. Despite the detrimental effects of mode interaction many major design codes do not provide sufficient pertinent guidance. In order to address this issue, a simple analytical method is proposed for calculating the collapse load of <b>laced</b> built-up <b>members</b> taking into account the above effects as well as global imperfections, local out-of straightness and plasticity, which is then verified by means of nonlinear finite element analysis, using either beam or shell elements. The proposed method is found to provide improved accuracy in comparison to EC 3 specifications in cases of global elastic failure. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
