50|$|A {{full range}} of {{accessories}} were offered: front dozer blades with cable or hydraulic lifts, rear ripper blades for breaking virgin bush as farmland in Australia, and a rear <b>logging</b> <b>winch</b> of 30,000 to 50,000 lbf pull.|$|E
40|$|Emergency {{situations}} during logging {{operations are}} considered. The necessity of {{monitoring of the}} carrying cable in the well was shown, especially at the jet perforation and seismic researches of wells. The way of monitoring of logging cable and geophysical probe {{by means of the}} electric drive of tripping works of the <b>logging</b> <b>winch</b> is offered. This method allows timely to identify the wedges of geophysical equipment and the tension of the cable in well without interfering into construction of logging installation by means of algorithmic processing of sensors of electric drive. Research was conducted on the simulation model; these results indirectly confirm the possibility of using of electric drive for monitoring of downhole equipment...|$|E
5000|$|The OC-9 {{was fitted}} with a three-meter blade. Its design allowed for angling, a crucial design factor used in grading roads. Other {{attachments}} included a <b>log</b> <b>winch</b> or 3-Tyne multi-shank ripper. The OC-96 was {{fitted with a}} [...] bucket.|$|R
50|$|Hyster {{also made}} a {{successful}} line of <b>logging</b> <b>winches</b> and compactor attachments, both {{of which could be}} attached to other manufacturers' machines including Caterpillar.The Hyster name has been associated with forklift trucks for many decades, however, Hyster was also prominent manufacturer of compaction equipment. From the 1950s through the 1980s they had a comprehensive and well-regarded line of products. Along with the Raygo company these two manufacturers were perhaps the best known in the US, until European and other brands became common.|$|R
50|$|About 7.6 m {{south-west}} of the boiler, to {{the west}} of the blowdown tank, is a Walkers Ltd (Maryborough) steam winch, which was used to power a stiff leg derrick crane for moving <b>logs.</b> The <b>winch</b> is a twin- cylinder horizontal reversing single-drum second-motion steam winch; its steam cylinders are 8 inches (203mm) in diameter, and the stroke is 14 inches (356mm).|$|R
40|$|The authors {{conducted}} a comparative test {{to determine whether}} the introduction of a hydraulic slack puller allowed reducing the physiological workload of operators assigned to <b>log</b> <b>winching</b> tasks. The tests were conducted in northern Italy, on the mountains near Como. The study involved five volunteer subjects, considered representatives of the regional logging workforce. Physiological workload was determined by measuring the operators’ heart rate upon completion of specific tasks. The slack puller improved the efficiency of downhill winching, since it allowed a single operator to pull out the cable on his own, without requiring the assistance of a colleague. However, introduction of the slack puller did not result in any reductions of operator physiological workload. The main stressor when working on a steep slope is moving up and down the slope: pulling a cable is only a secondary stressor. Any measures targeting secondary stressors are unlikely to produce dramatic reductions of operator workload...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{conducted}} three comparative tests, {{to determine}} if the replacement of steel cable with synthetic rope may allow reducing the physiological workload of forest operators assigned to <b>log</b> <b>winching</b> tasks. The tests were conducted in Northern Italy, on the Alpine mountain and involved 7 volunteer subjects. The physiological workload was determined by measuring the operator's heart rate upon completion of every task, using heart-rate monitors. Test one was conducted under simplified, controlled conditions and detected a statistically significant reduction of relative heart rate when carrying synthetic rope, as compared to steel cable. However, tests two and three were performed under real operational conditions, and were inconclusive. Real operational conditions are characterized by the interaction of many factors, which may confound the results of the tests, or offset the benefits potentially obtained with the introduction of synthetic rope. Nevertheless, the introduction of synthetic rope offers the benefit of easier handling, which was very much appreciated by all test subjects. © 2011 Steve Harrison, John Herbohn...|$|R
30|$|Logging tool {{responses}} are badly affected by breakout of wall-rock during drilling, {{as well as}} stick-and-pull as <b>logging</b> tools are <b>winched</b> up the well (Yan 2002). Keeping this in mind, during this study, the data set from the three wells were carefully examined. All geophysical well logs which exhibited strange, and possibly inappropriate data were ignored. In addition, correction of the offset between core depth and logging depth was done, so that the geophysical well logs and experimental data may be matched and integrated effectively.|$|R
5000|$|Johnston {{was still}} {{the owner of the}} Mount Molloy sawmill when it burnt down on 31 January 1934, William J Santowski being the manager at the time. It was {{reported}} that [...] "One 350 h.p. boiler was in the destroyed building, also one Sandycroft steam engine; one twin circular log breaking down plant, four saw benches, one planing machine, saw-dust carriers, belting, shafting and pulleys and other tools of various descriptions, 29 circular saws, one <b>log</b> rolling <b>winch,</b> two saw sharpening machines, three cross-cut sawing machines". However, the employees were able to protect the boiler, main engines and pumping plant from serious damage. There were also two other planing machines in a separate building that was not destroyed. Prior to the fire Johnston had purchased machinery for a new sawmill at Shipton's Flat near Cooktown, and after the fire he placed some of the machinery at Mount Molloy. He claimed that the latter was a paying proposition and a very essential part of his organisation. It was also essential to have the mill at Mount Molloy, as most hardwood supplies came from there.|$|R
40|$|Selective {{logging in}} mature {{hardwood}} stands of Caspian forests often causes physical damage to residual trees through felling and skidding operations, {{resulting in a}} decline in bole quality and subsequent loss of tree value. This study evaluated the logging damage to residual trees following logging operations. A total density of 5. 1 trees/ha and 17. 3 m 3 /ha of wood were harvested. On average, 9. 8 trees were damaged for every tree extracted, including 8 trees destroyed or severely damaged. The most common types of damage included uprooted stems, stem wounds to the cambial layer, and bark scrapes. Damage to trees sustained along skid trails {{was found to be}} significantly more than the damage that incurred within <b>logging</b> gaps and <b>winching</b> areas. The {{results of this study suggest}} that logging practices also need to be accompanied by close supervision of field personnel and post-logging site inspections to be implemented properly...|$|R
60|$|There {{was just}} {{light enough to}} see by, and no more, for, though the frost was bitter, heavy snow-clouds hung about the hills. Shingle and {{boulders}} were covered with frozen spray, and long spears of ice stretched out into the pool below the fall. Now and then a block of ice drove athwart them with a detonating crackle. The pool was lower {{than it had been}} in summer, and the stream frothed in angry eddies in the midst of it, where shattered masses of rock rent by the blasting charges lay as they had fallen. It was essential that the rock should be cleared away, and a great redwood log with a rounded foot let into a socket swung by wire rope guys above the pool. Another wire rope with a pair of iron claws at the end of it ran over a block at the head of the <b>log</b> to the <b>winch</b> below, and the primitive derrick and its fittings had cost Nasmyth a great deal of money, as well as a week's arduous labour.|$|R
40|$|The authors tested two mini-yarders, one for uphill and {{the other}} for {{downhill}} extraction. The two machines were modern commercial models, offering state-of-the-art yarding technology on a miniature scale and at a much lower cost than required for purchasing a full-size tower yarder. The two units must not be regarded as alternative, but rather as complementary, since they offer different capabilities and advantages. Both machines were tested while harvesting firewood from the thinning of young beech stands in Central Italy. The tests indicated that both units can reach a productivity between 1. 5 and 2. 4 m 3 SMH- 1, including all delays, as well as set-up and dismantle time. Calculated extraction cost ranged between 24 and over 30 € m- 3. The authors calculated a set of regression equations for estimating machine productivity {{as a function of the}} main work conditions. The performance of the studied mini-yarders does not seem much inferior to that achieved by professional light tower yarder under the same work conditions, but the lighter construction of the small-scale units may result in a lower resistance to wear and abuse. In any case, mini-yarders seem ideal for deployment under the typical conditions of small-scale forestry, offering a good solution to wood extraction on steep terrain, competitive with animal and <b>winch</b> <b>logging</b> in terms of productivity, cost and operator comfort. © Steve Harrison, John Herbohn 2009...|$|R
40|$|<b>Log</b> {{bunching}} with <b>winches</b> {{is still}} popular in small scale forest operations, and where machine traffic {{is confined to}} widely spaced designated trails. Like all tree handling methods, winching has a potential to incur residual stand damage, especially when harvested trees need to be moved around a dense residual stand. Snatch blocks are special pulleys designed for changing the pulling direction, in order to maneuver the winch load around obstacles. This study was aimed at determining the effect of using a snatch block on stand damage and work productivity. Using a snatch block allowed reducing by one quarter the frequency of wounded trees, which dropped from 50 % to 36 %. The snatch block was especially effective in preventing damage to dominant trees. No significant difference was recorded for wound size and wound severity. Survival of advance regeneration was significantly higher when using a snatch block. When no block was used, {{almost half of the}} saplings were lost. In contrast, only one sapling out of four was lost when using a snatch block. Using a snatch block did not cause any significant change of work productivity. Lower incidence of hang-up delays and faster pulling fully offset the time required to rig the snatch block. The study did not include ergonomics, and could not indicate how operator workload was affected by adding the weight of a snatch block to that of the cable and chain rigging. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|Increasing productivity, {{reducing}} cost, reducing soil damage, {{reducing the}} impact of harvesting on standing tree and regeneration are all very important objectives in ground skidding system {{in the management of}} the Hyrcanian forest. The research carried out to obtain these objectives included four logging methods, tree length method (TLM), long length method (LLM), short length method (SLM), and wood extraction by mule (mule) in northern Iran. In order to determine the cost per unit, time study techniques were used for each harvesting method, time study data are shifted to logarithmic data based on 10. On the basis of the developed models simulated, 11 skidding turns are simulated and the unit cost are estimated depending on the diameter of the log (DL), skidding distance (SD), and the winching distance (WD) for 11 different cycles with TLM, LLM and SLM. The results showed that on average, the net costs per extraction of one cubic meter of wood were 3. 06, 5. 69, 6. 81 and 34. 36 €/m 3 in TLM, LLM, SLM and mule. The costs depending on diameter of log (DL), skidding distance (SD) and winching distance (WD) showed that the most economical alternative for Northern Iran is TLM. In the cut-to-length system, the costs of both alternatives LLM, SLM were significantly dependent on DL., thus the result of this study suggests {{that as long as the}} diameter of the felled trees is less than 40 cm, the cut-to-length system is not an economical alternative, whilst the cut-to-length method can be applied for trees with a diameter more than 40 cm. Where diameters are more than 40 cm TLM it is more economical than SLM, however it was not significantly different. Depending on SD in short skidding distance SLM is preferable to LLM but in cases of long skidding distance LLM is more economical than SLM. The winching distance affect was not a factor on cost. To assess the damage on seedlings and standing trees a 100 % inventory method was employed in pre-hauling and post-hauling, alongside of skidding trails, winching strips and mule hauling with a 12 m width. To chose the best alternative depending on standing damage the Analysis of multiple criterial approval (MA) was applied. The amount of trees damaged by winching operation were 11. 89 % in TLM, 14. 44 % in LLM 27. 59 %, SLM and 0 stem and by skidding operation were 16. 73 %, 3. 13 % and 8. 78 % of total trees in TLM, LLM and SLM. In the winching area about 14 %, 20 %, 21 % and 6 % of the total regeneration was damaged by TLM, LLM, SLM and mule and the skidding operation damaged 7. 5 % in TLM, 7. 4 % LLM and 9. 4 % in SLM. The friendliest alternative to residual standing was mule but in manual method (where the wood extraction is done by skidder) MA showed that the best alternative depending on residual damage is LLM. To determine the degree of soil compaction a core sampling technique of bulk density was used. Soil samples collected from the horizontal face of a soil pit at 10 cm depth soil core, at 50 m intervals on skid trials, in winching strips and control are (no vehicles pass) a soil sample was taken at 10 m intervals in the hauling direction of the mule. In order to determine the post-harvesting extent of disturbance on skidding trails by skidding operations, the disturbed widths were measured at 50 m intervals along the skid trails. In the winching area, where the <b>winched</b> <b>logs</b> created a streak of displaced soil, the width of the displaced streak was measured at 5 m interval along the winching strip. In mule hauling operations the width of a streak created by a mule foot track was measured at 10 m intervals. To compare increased average bulk density between alternatives one way The ANOVA, Duncan test and Dunnett t-test with a 95 % confidence level were used. A General linear model was applied to relate the increasing bulk density and the slope gradient. To realize the correlation between the increment of soil bulk density and the slope gradient and the correlation between the soil compaction and soil moisture content (%) The Pearson correlation test was applied. To choose the best alternative (in manual method) a MA test was applied again. The bulk density on the skidding trail increased 51 % for 30 skidding turn, 35 % for 31 skidding turn (one unloaded and one loaded pass) and 46 % for 41 skidding turn. Results of ANOVA (p < 0. 05) show significant differences of bulk density between alternatives. Duncan test and the Dunnett t-test indicated that the increasing soil bulk density was not significant between control samples and winching strip of TLM and extraction by mule samples. The general linear modeling and Pearson correlation test results indicated that the slope gradient had an insignificant effect on soil compaction, whilst the Pearson test indicates a medium negative correlation between soil compaction and percentage of soil moisture. By ground-based winching operation 0. 07 %, 0. 03 %, 0. 05 % and 0. 002 % of the total area and by ground based skidding operation 1. 21 %, 1. 67 %, 0. 81 % and 0. 00 % of total area was disturbed and compacted in TLM, LLM, SLM and mule. The Pearson correlation results show that the width of disturbed area was significantly influenced by the diameter of logs and length of logs (p ˂ 0. 05), but there is no significant correlation between soil disturbance width and slope. The results of analysis of MA showed that soil compaction was not related to logging method but sensitivity analysis of MA shows that LLM and TLM are both preferable to SLM...|$|R
