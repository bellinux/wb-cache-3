500|$|All {{band members}} of Bloc Party {{conceived}} A Weekend in the City during 2005 while on tour {{in support of}} their critically acclaimed debut album Silent Alarm. Despite missing their home city of London, the quartet became increasingly disillusioned with the culture in the area each time they sporadically returned. Band member Gordon Moakes has noted, [...] "The contrast we saw between being away on tour and being home... we would see that London wasn't changing really and that the people we'd grown up with were part of that." [...] Okereke wrote many songs in 2005 and early 2006 and used a concept he called [...] "Urbanite Relaxation" [...] to expand upon the themes of <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>leisure</b> in the metropolis. The band recorded around 30soundchecks for the initial lyrics using a MiniDisc player. The rest of the tracks were written in April 2006 before they entered the studio recording process.|$|E
2500|$|Latent {{sectional}} divisions suddenly activated derogatory sectional imagery {{which emerged}} into sectional ideologies. As industrial capitalism gained {{momentum in the}} North, Southern writers emphasized whatever aristocratic traits they valued (but often did not practice) in their own society: courtesy, grace, chivalry, {{the slow pace of}} life, orderly <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>leisure.</b> This supported their argument that slavery provided a more humane society than industrial labor. [...] In his Cannibals All!, George Fitzhugh argued that the antagonism between labor and capital in a free society would result in [...] "robber barons" [...] and [...] "pauper slavery", while in a slave society such antagonisms were avoided. He advocated enslaving Northern factory workers, for their own benefit. Abraham Lincoln, on the other hand, denounced such Southern insinuations that Northern wage earners were fatally fixed in that condition for life. To Free Soilers, the stereotype of the South was one of a diametrically opposite, static society in which the slave system maintained an entrenched anti-democratic aristocracy.|$|E

It may suffice, (for the present at least,) to declare, that the causes that have delayed the publication of these volumes for so long a period after they had been printed off, were not connected with any neglect of my own; and that they would form an instructive comment on the chapter concerning authorship as a trade, addressed to young men of genius in the first volume of this work. I remember the ludicrous effect produced on my mind by the fast sentence of an auto-biography, which, happily for the writer, was as meagre in incidents as it is well possible for the life of an individual to be-- [...] "The eventful life which I am about to record, from the hour in which I rose into existence on this planet, etc." [...] Yet when, notwithstanding this warning example of self-importance before me, I review my own life, I cannot refrain from applying the same epithet to it, and with more than ordinary emphasis--and no private feeling, that affected myself only, should prevent me from publishing the same, (for write it I assuredly shall, should <b>life</b> <b>and</b> <b>leisure</b> be granted me,) if continued reflection should strengthen my present belief, that my history would add its contingent to the enforcement of one important truth, to wit, that we must not only love our neighbours as ourselves, but ourselves likewise as our neighbours; and that we can do neither unless we love God above both.|$|E
