60|$|It was {{a chamber}} of death {{into which he}} was ushered, dismal--yet, of its sort, unique, marvelous. The room itself {{might have been the}} {{sleeping}} apartment of an empress--lofty, with white paneled walls, adorned simply with gilded lines; with high windows, closely curtained now, so that neither sound nor the light of day might penetrate into the room. In the middle of the apartment upon a canopy bedside, which had once adorned a king's palace, lay Madame de Maupassim. Her face was already touched with the finger of death, yet her eyes were undimmed and her lips unquivering. Her hands, covered with rings, lay out before her upon the <b>lace</b> coverlid. <b>Supported</b> by many pillows, she was issuing her last instructions with the cold precision of the man of affairs who makes the necessary arrangements for a few days, absence from his business.|$|R

5000|$|White {{settlers}} {{were also}} moving into Wisconsin, and coveted tribal lands, which {{were held in}} common under a 1838 treaty negotiated by Chief Daniel Bread, who by his death in 1873 thought such private allocation inevitable. The next year, Hill drafted a petition to New York's legislature in Albany concerning interference with Oneida fishing rights under previous treaties, which was causing considerable hardship to tribal members remaining in New York. At least one Indian Agent supposedly assigned to help the tribe also forbad them to sell shingles and other lumber products to support themselves during a crop failure, which Hill and missionary and teacher the Rev. Edward A. Goodnough (who worked among the Oneidas from 1863 to 1890) thought was designed to get the tribe to sell lands to whites (if not his cronies), and eventually managed to secure that agent's dismissal. [...] Hill also helped tribal members learn new farming techniques and secure machinery. Women also made baskets and beadwork for sale, and after 1900 learned to make <b>lace</b> to <b>support</b> themselves in the modernized world.|$|R

These were the first ever boots with the steel toe cap at the front, long <b>laces</b> and ankle <b>support.</b> These boots also had metal studs or tacks put in the sole the bottom so the players would have more stability on the pitch. In the later part of the 19th century the first ever football-specific boot was designed, made of thick and heavy leather which ran right to the ankle for increased protection, the first boot weighed 500 g and would double in weight when it was wet.|$|R
40|$|Almost {{a decade}} ago, Berridge, Dance, Beecham and Field (2008, p. 49) noted a {{worrying}} absence of {{research into the}} UK picture of education support teams {{in terms of their}} organisational structure and priorities. This thesis represents an original contribution to knowledge in regard to the educational support provided for Looked-After Children in Wales. The overall sample (n= 28) comprised four Looked After Children Education (LACE) coordinators, seven LACE team practitioners and seventeen young people with looked-after status, aged 14 - 16 years old, from across four local authorities in south Wales. This qualitative research is informed by constructionist ontology and is positioned within an interpretivist framework. Data were subjected to a coding framework and thematic analysis. The research yields useful insights with some clear implications for policy and practice. It has sought to address that void and add to a slowly growing knowledge base as {{little is known about the}} ways in which LACE Coordinators and their team practitioners interpret and enact relevant policy in their day to day work. Research findings include: The LACE team relationships with young people being described by workers were typically in administrative and procedural terms; <b>LACE</b> practitioners’ <b>support</b> typically lasts for an hour, once a week, and which was described by some young people as of welcome but limited value. Thus, the perennial discourse of ‘low attainment’ that surrounds looked-after children might be more aptly be re-cast as ‘low investment’ by the state, national and local; LACE practitioners’ described their work practice as a specialist knowledge area, but also disclosed how their knowledge and expertise was often undervalued or rejected by other external practitioners; young people’s identities appeared to be fashioned, by LACE practitioners, through occupational assumptions derived from a broader public welfare child discourse. In contrast the young people’s own identities did not coalesce with the perceptions of LACE practitioners. Instead, their comments indicated a more ‘normalised’, non-stigmatised, and pragmatic but also care (as affect) related sense of self. The thesis has argued that there needs to be a new framework that unites the way workers understand looked-after children and the relationships that will optimise meaningful achievement...|$|R
50|$|Upon {{her move}} to County Limerick, O'Brien set about {{supporting}} the failing Limerick lace industry. She {{made contact with}} local lace craftswomen, and provided them with high quality materials {{as well as her}} own designs. From this she arranged the sale of the work, using her circle of friends in Dublin and London. O'Brien was a central figure in the foundation of the Private Committee for Promoting Irish <b>Lace,</b> with the <b>support</b> of Alan Cole of the Department of Science and Art, South Kensington and James Brenan RHA. This committee led to the establishment of the lace training school in Limerick in May 1889, and in 1893 on the committee's request her took over the running of the school. When her family moved to New Hall, near Ennis, County Clare, in 1890. In 1895, she established Clare Embroidery, which was run from her home. She was assisted in this endeavour by the O'Briens' children's nurse, a Scotswoman named Mina Keppie, which had the capacity to train up to 15 girls at a time. The business moved with the family to Ballyalla in 1898, and by 1910 they were training up to 27 girls at one time. Both ventures exhibited their work with arts and crafts exhibitions in Ireland, Britain, and America from the 1890s to the 1920s. Amongst these exhibitions were those of the Royal Dublin Society, the Arts and Crafts Society of Ireland, the world fairs in Chicago and St Louis in 1893 and 1904 respectively winning several awards. At Lady Arran's Windsor sale in 1900, both Queen Victoria and the princess of Wales purchased examples of their work.|$|R
