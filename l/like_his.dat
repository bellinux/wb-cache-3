5|$|When Secretariat first {{retired to}} Claiborne Farm, his sperm showed {{some signs of}} immaturity, so he was bred to three non-Thoroughbred mares in December 1973 to test his fertility.

5|$|During the {{fighting}} in May 1940, the Pierlot government came into conflict with King Leopold III who had taken personal command of the Belgian Army. The first confrontation {{between the government and}} the King occurred on 10 May, when the King, against the wishes of the government, left for his military headquarters without addressing the Chamber of Representatives <b>like</b> <b>his</b> father, Albert I, had done in 1914. Contact between the King and the government became sporadic while the government feared that the King was acting beyond his constitutional powers. <b>Like</b> <b>his</b> father, Leopold was subject to Article 64 of the constitution which specified that no act of the King was valid unless counter-signed by a government minister, yet also given supreme power in military matters under Article 68. The two clauses appeared to contradict each other and gave all the king's acts in military-political matters an unclear constitutional footing.|$|E

5|$|In 1866 William C. Clayton {{became the}} institute's {{principal}} and {{presided over the}} school {{for a few more}} terms. <b>Like</b> <b>his</b> predecessor John Jeremiah Jacob, Clayton had been a student at both the Romney Academy and at the institute, and he later served in the West Virginia Senate.

5|$|In another work of Shakespeare, Othello (1603), it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that he has made another reference. In act 5, scene 2 the main character Othello compares himself to a myrrh tree with its constant stream of tears (Myrrha's tears). The reference is justified in the way that it draws inspiration from Book X of Ovid's Metamorphoses, just <b>like</b> <b>his</b> previously written poem, Venus and Adonis, did.|$|E
