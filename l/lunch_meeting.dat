Everett's Radio 1 show featured zany voices, surreal characters, multi-tracked jingles and trailers, all of his own creation and compilation. It was Everett who had persuaded Johnny Beerling and station controller Robin Scott, at a <b>lunch</b> <b>meeting</b> before his appointment, of the importance of the new station having jingles.

[...] The President wanted to see Saint-Gaudens' standing eagle from the ten-dollar piece adapted in a recessed surface for the smaller pieces, and, if it did not constitute a change of design, used on the ten-dollar piece as well (a project that did not go beyond the talking stage). [...] Bigelow wrote to Pratt on May 1 after conferring with Leach, stating that the Mint Director would likely not object if Pratt were to improve Saint-Gaudens' standing eagle, but [...] "I would not, if I were you, get too far from the original, as the President likes it.

500|$|Fox, who {{graduated}} from RADA on 1 July 2001, followed up The Hole by appearing in Robert Altman's 2001 Academy Award-winning film Gosford Park. He then donned uniforms in a slew of film and television features, including roles as a German airman in Island at War (2004), an SS officer in The Last Drop (2005), and as British soldiers in the 2002 films Deathwatch and Ultimate Force, and in Colditz (2005). In the last made-for-television film, Fox played Capt.

Actor Kevin Whately caught Fox's performance in the last ten minutes of the film, which he characterised as [...] "this young English boy going bonkers and wandering out to be shot", and thought [...] "He's interesting." [...] The next day, at a <b>lunch</b> <b>meeting</b> with [...] "all the powers that be" [...] regarding a new project, Whately mentioned that Fox [...] "would be worth taking a look at".|$|E

Kikukawa dismissed the article as [...] "tabloid, sensationalist journalism". Upon learning about a second article referring to payments by Olympus to [...] "anti-social forces", a euphemism for yakuza (Japanese criminal organizations), The Japan Times notes that from the start, Facta remained the lone Japanese journal to scoop the Olympus accounting irregularities until the scandal broke in Western media sources after Woodford exposed the matter. Woodford began to write a series of six letters to Mori and/or Kikukawa regarding his concerns as to governance issues [...] "relating to the company's M (acquisitions) activities". Woodford copied later letters to the company's auditors, and threatened to resign {{if he did not}} receive satisfactory responses about the 2008 Gyrus acquisition costs, and the goodwill impairment of around $600million made that year for the other acquisitions.|$|E

50|$|Disinclined {{to use the}} Council {{meetings}} for advice, Johnson, like Kennedy, relied heavily on his National Security Advisers: McGeorge Bundy, who remained in office through February 1966, and Bundy's successor, Walt Rostow, who served {{to the end of}} the administration. Indeed, scholars looking at the evolution of the NSC from its inception to the 1970s contend that the National Security Adviser and his White House centered staff increasingly assumed a more prominent role than the official National Security Council and that Johnson, like Kennedy before him, played a key role in this development. Focusing on Johnson's Presidency alone, however, some of his advisers, including Secretary of State Rusk and Walt Rostow, insisted that the Council's advisory role was actually performed principally by another institution, the Tuesday Lunch Group, and that those <b>lunch</b> <b>meetings</b> were in effect regular NSC meetings.|$|R

Lewis (Jack) in August 1952, when she made a trip to the United Kingdom, after a two-year {{correspondence}} with him. She planned to finish her book on the Ten Commandments that she had been working on, and which showed influences by Lewis's style of apologetics. After several <b>lunch</b> <b>meetings</b> and walks accompanying Davidman and his brother, Warren Lewis wrote in his diary that [...] "a rapid friendship" [...] had developed between his younger brother and Davidman, whom he described as [...] "a Christian convert of Jewish race, medium height, good figure, horn rimmed specs, quite extraordinarily uninhibited." [...] She spent Christmas and a fortnight at The Kilns with the brothers. Though Davidman was deeply in love with Lewis there was no reciprocation on his side.|$|R
2500|$|Rather than {{accepting}} {{responsibility for}} a transgression through {{the form of an}} apology, a transgressor who explains why they engaged in a behavior is engaging in excuses or justifications. [...] While excuses and justifications aim to minimize blame on the transgressor, the two address blame minimization from completely opposite perspectives. Excuses attempt to minimize blame by focusing on a transgressor’s inability to control their actions (e.g., “How would I have known my exgirlfriend was {{going to be at the}} party.”) or displace blame on a third party (e.g., “I went to lunch with my exgirlfriend because I did not want to hurt her feelings.”). [...] Conversely, a justification minimizes blame by suggesting that actions surrounding the transgression were justified or that the transgression was not severe. [...] For example, a transgressor may justify having lunch with a past romantic interest, suggesting to their current partner that the <b>lunch</b> <b>meeting</b> was of no major consequence (e.g., “We are just friends.”).|$|E
2500|$|More {{offers for}} Leno had sprung up (including a lucrative {{one for a}} {{syndicated}} program by Sony Pictures Television), and Zucker began to make trips to the Burbank studio {{in an effort to}} keep Leno in spring 2008. He gave him numerous suggestions, including a Bob Hope-type deal (high-profile specials), a Sunday night primetime show, or even a nightly cable show on USA Network (owned by NBCUniversal). Executives began to entertain an ideal solution—pay off O'Brien and retain Leno—but Zucker viewed the idea as [...] "outrageous". By this time, NBC had already broken ground on a new studio for O'Brien's Tonight Show, renovating Stage 1 at the Universal lot in Universal City, for a reported US$50 million. During a spring <b>lunch</b> <b>meeting</b> with Jeff Ross, NBC sports chief Dick Ebersol imparted some advice: that O'Brien retire silly antics (such as his signature [...] "string dance") and focus more on pitching his show to middle America, which would involve stretching out his monologue. O'Brien, then a year away from inheriting the sacred ground of The Tonight Show, was indeed lengthening his monologue, but viewed suggestions from Ludwin as largely unnecessary: [...] "I think people are overthinking the twelve-thirty-to-eleven- thirty shift", he said, instead desiring to put his own stamp on the show's tradition. By this point, O'Brien's popularity, sky high at the time of the contract signing, had gone down slightly. He had neglected to change his act to suit a more mainstream audience (as NBC imagined he would) and CBS's Craig Ferguson, who occupied the post-Letterman slot, had begun to occasionally trump O'Brien in overall ratings. Though internal anxiety increased among executives, most tended to still support O'Brien.|$|E

The band spent much time during the spring and summer of 1996 contemplating options. The three had no qualms signing to a major label, and were wary of purists attempting to define [...] "punk". The band felt a great affinity for Epitaph, as many of their favorite acts (Pennywise, Bad Religion, NOFX) were signed there. The band felt they were nothing but honest regarding their ambitions: [...] "I try and tell kids, 'The Clash, Sex Pistols and the Ramones did it, so how come we can't?" [...] guitarist Tom DeLonge reasoned. [...] "If people are bummed, we don't care. It's normally critics. Older critics." ...|$|R
