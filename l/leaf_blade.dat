5|$|Among fertile species, A.bradleyi {{most closely}} resembles its parent species A.montanum. Several {{characteristics}} exit to distinguish them: the pinnae of A.bradleyi are toothed and less deeply lobed or cut than A.montanum (where the pinnae are often fully cut to pinnules), the dark {{color of the}} stipe extends into the rachis, the upper pinnae lack stems, and the overall shape of the <b>leaf</b> <b>blade</b> is parallel-sided, rather than lance-shaped. A.bradleyi also shows some resemblance to black spleenwort (A.adiantum-nigrum) (although their ranges do not overlap). The latter may be identified by its distinctly triangular-shaped <b>leaf</b> <b>blade,</b> more deeply cut leaves (the pinnules of its basal pinnae are lobed), and enlarged , rather than acroscopic, pinnules.|$|E
5|$|One {{potentially}} distinguishing {{character is}} {{the shape of}} the ultimate segments in the middle part of the <b>leaf</b> <b>blade,</b> which are oblong in A.pedatum and long-triangular or reniform (kidney-shaped) in A.viridimontanum and some specimens of A.aleuticum. Furthermore, A.viridimontanum can grow in both shade and sun, while A.pedatum grows in shade only.|$|E
5|$|Asplenium bradleyi {{is similar}} to two hybrid species {{of which it is}} a parent, Graves' spleenwort (A.×gravesii), a hybrid with A.pinnatifidum, and Wherry's spleenwort (A.×wherryi), a {{backcross}} with A.montanum. In A.×gravesii, the dark color of the stipe ends {{at the base of the}} <b>leaf</b> <b>blade,</b> the pinnae are more shallowly lobed and the enlargement of acroscopic lobes or pinnules is less distinct, and the apical portion of the blade forms a long, tapering tip with slight lobes (as in A.pinnatifidum), rather than being cut into pinnae. In addition to the general reduction of the toothiness of A.bradleyi, A.×gravesii also shows faint winging along the stipe. Likewise, in A.×wherryi, the dark color of the stipe again ends at the base of the <b>leaf</b> <b>blade,</b> the overall shape of the blade tends to be more distinctly lance-shaped, and the fronds are somewhat more deeply cut than A.bradleyi, progressing from bipinnate in the lower half to pinnate-pinnatifid and finally pinnate at the apex. Finally, the diploid hybrid A.montanum × platyneuron, from which A.bradleyi arose by chromosome doubling, is essentially identical in appearance to A.bradleyi. On close examination, its spores are found to be abortive, and the sori are smaller and not do not become fused with each other as they grow, as they do in fertile A.bradleyi.|$|E

Planting material was maize var. BARI hybrid maize 7. Three levels of population density (66667, 83333 and 111111 plants ha- 1) and four source-sink manipulation, viz. removed all <b>leaf</b> <b>blades</b> below the lower most cob, removed tassel and all <b>leaf</b> <b>blades</b> below the lower most cob, removed all <b>leaf</b> <b>blades</b> except those adjacent to cob and no clipping, were imposed at silking stage. During crop growth, removal of all <b>leaf</b> <b>blades</b> below the cob showed less adverse effect on grain yield and yield parameters and the leaves so removed can be used as green fodder. Removal of tassel and all <b>leaf</b> <b>blades</b> except those adjacent to cob showed adverse effect on grain yield and yield parameters. Complete defoliation severely reduced grains on cob.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the nutritional status of the Cardinal grapes that are grown in Çanakkale. Leaf and soil samples were taken from 18 different vineyards to ensure a uniform sampling area. Although all of the soil samples contained suitable pH values for grapes, levels of organic matter content were found to be low. Lime (CaCO 3) content was at an insufficient level in 72 % of the soils at 0 - 30 cm depth and in 61 % of the soils at 30 - 60 cm depth. Phosphorous (P) content was at low and medium levels in 94 % of the soils. Potassium (K) was found to be insufficient in 50 % of the soils. In both depths, the iron (Fe) content of 33 % of soils was lower than the critical level. Manganese (Mn) content was at an insufficient level in 22 % of the soils. There were no nutritional problems with respect to zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) in the soils. Nitrogen (N), calcium (Ca), phosphorous (P), iron (Fe) and copper (Cu) contents of <b>leaf</b> <b>blades</b> were higher than those of leaf petioles. Potassium (K), magnesium (Mg) and manganese (Mn) contents of leaf petioles were higher than those of <b>leaf</b> <b>blades.</b> There were no differences between zinc (Zn) contents in <b>leaf</b> <b>blades</b> and <b>leaf</b> petioles. The N content of 89 % of the <b>leaf</b> <b>blades</b> and P content of 61 % of the <b>leaf</b> <b>blades</b> was higher than the critical level.

5|$|The plant's initial {{response}} to contact with prey consists of thigmotropic (movement {{in response to}} touch) tentacle movement, with tentacles bending toward the prey {{and the center of}} the leaf to maximize contact. D. anglica is also capable of further movement, being able to bend the actual <b>leaf</b> <b>blade</b> around prey to further the digestion process. Tentacle movement can occur in a matter of minutes, whereas the leaf takes hours or days to bend. When something gets caught, the tentacles touching the prey exude additional mucilage to mire down the prey, which eventually dies of exhaustion or is asphyxiated as the mucilage clogs its tracheae. Once the prey has been digested and the resulting nutrient solution has been absorbed by the plant, the leaf unfurls, leaving only the prey's exoskeleton behind.|$|E
5|$|This fern was {{at first}} {{identified}} by André Michaux, in 1803, as black spleenwort (Asplenium adiantum-nigrum). Carl Ludwig Willdenow recognized and {{described it as a}} separate species, which he named Asplenium montanum, in 1810. In 1901, John A. Shafer attempted to transfer it to the genus Athyrium as Athyrium montanum, but this name is illegitimate as a later homonym of Athyrium montanum (Lam.) Röhl. ex Spreng. The species was segregated from Asplenium as Chamaefilix montana by Oliver Atkins Farwell in 1931. The change was not widely accepted and current authorities do not recognize this segregate genus. In 1974, Timothy Reeves described an unusual population of A.montanum from the Shawangunk Mountains. Having used chromatography to show {{that it was not a}} hybrid, he interpreted it as a new form, Asplenium montanum forma shawangunkense. In this form, as contrasted with the usual forma montanum, the <b>leaf</b> <b>blade</b> is yellow-green, the fronds continue highly dissected to the apex and do not come to a pointed tip, the fronds are shorter and more highly dissected than usual, and all fronds are sterile.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the hybrid}} species {{of which it}} is a parent, A.pinnatifidum is most similar to Graves' spleenwort (A.×gravesii), a hybrid with Bradley's spleenwort (A.bradleyi), and to a lesser extent, to Trudell's spleenwort (A.×trudellii) and Kentucky spleenwort (A.×kentuckiense). In A.×gravesii, the dark color of the stipe extends {{to the base of the}} <b>leaf</b> <b>blade,</b> the blades often have more than one pair of pinnae, and their edges are shallowly {{wrinkled}} or toothed. In addition, the basal pinnae, which may themselves be pinnatifid, lack a stalk, the <b>leaf</b> <b>blade</b> is pointed at the tip but not drawn out at length, and there are generally fewer fronds. Its sori are dark brown, rather than cinnamon brown. A.trudellii is fully pinnate in the lower half of the blade, and its pinnae are toothed. A.×kentuckiense is also fully pinnate towards the base of the blade, with four to six pairs of pinnae, and the brown color of its stipe extends up into the basal part of the rachis.|$|E

40|$|Neotyphodium uncinatum and Neotyphodium siegelii are fungal {{symbionts}} (endophytes) of {{meadow fescue}} (MF; Lolium pratense), which they protect from insects by producing loline alkaloids. High levels of lolines are produced following insect damage or mock herbivory (clipping). Although loline alkaloid levels were greatly elevated in regrowth after clipping, loline-alkaloid biosynthesis (LOL) gene expression in regrowth and basal tissues {{was similar to}} unclipped controls. The dramatic increase of lolines in regrowth reflected the much higher concentrations in young (center) versus older (outer) <b>leaf</b> <b>blades,</b> so LOL gene expression was compared in these tissues. In MF-N. siegelii, LOL gene expression was similar in younger and older <b>leaf</b> <b>blades,</b> whereas expression of N. uncinatum LOL genes and some associated biosynthesis genes was higher in younger than older <b>leaf</b> <b>blades.</b> Because lolines are derived from amino acids that are mobilized to new growth, we tested the amino acid levels in center and outer <b>leaf</b> <b>blades.</b> Younger <b>leaf</b> <b>blades</b> of aposymbiotic plants (no endophyte present) had {{significantly higher levels of}} asparagine and sometimes glutamine compared to older <b>leaf</b> <b>blades.</b> The amino acid levels were much lower in MF-N. siegelii and MF-N. uncinatum compared to aposymbiotic plants and MF with Epichloë festucae (a closely related symbiont), which lacked lolines.
