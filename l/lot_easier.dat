They had been captured {{not far from the}} North Fort by an English scouting party, Redhead was looking for items to sell to the troops inside when he stumbled across the Spanish officers checking the strength of the walls. The North Fort was a strong fortress which secured the entrance to Bergen op Zoom from the Scheldt on the north-east side. The two Spanish stayed as guests at the Lieutenant of the garrison's house belonging to William Grimstone and large bribes were offered to allow the Spanish into the North Gate. It was hoped that this would {{fall into the hands of}} Parma thus making the capture of Bergen a <b>lot</b> <b>easier.</b> Willoughby soon discovered this and by his orders pretended to give a ready consent to the proposal. As a ruse Grimstone pretended he was a staunch Catholic and were supporters of William Stanley the English turncoat. They secretly left the camp provided with letters from the two Spaniards to the Duke of Parma informing that everything was prepared for the admittance of the besiegers into the fort. On 6 October they soon met with Parma and were in conference - Parma obliged them to take an oath on the Sacrament that they were acting in good faith. Once this was done he gave them a large gold chain and promised a large sum of money in the event of success.|$|E
25|$|Ili {{returned}} to the Saints in 2017 for another run at a title. He was a dominate force {{in his second season}} as a Saint, highlighted by his pass-first nature to his free-scoring teammates. On 6 April 2017, Ili didn't put a shot up from the field in his side's 100–87 win over the Taranaki Mountainairs, scoring one point from a free-throw in 19 minutes, but he managed 10 assists and turned the ball over just once. With characteristic humbleness, Ili said after the game that his job was made a <b>lot</b> <b>easier</b> by the talented players around him, such as his backcourt starting partner Corey Webster. Throughout April, Ili continued his maturation into the league's best local point guard. On 17 April, he had 22 points and 15 assists in a 102–79 win over the Canterbury Rams. Eight days later, he had 27 points, 10 assists and six steals in a 110–84 win over the Nelson Giants. On 19 May, he scored a career-high 30 points in a 109–94 win over the Southland Sharks. He guided the Saints to a perfect 18–0 regular season and helped them earn another grand final appearance. In the NZNBL championship decider on 17 June, Ili set a new career high with 31 points in the Saints' 108–75 rout of the Sharks. The win saw the Saints collect their 10th NBL Championship, with Ili winning his third straight NZNBL title. The Saints became the first team to complete an unbeaten season, capping off a perfect 20–0 campaign with their grand final win over Southland. Ili's 31-point effort earned him Finals MVP honours. He also picked up All-Star Five honours in the end-of-season awards. For the season, he averaged career highs with 16.1 points, 6.5 assists and 2.3 steals, to go with 4.2 rebounds while appearing in all 20 games.|$|E
25|$|Melanoma only {{occurs in}} a small {{proportion}} of the population. Only 10% of those who have melanoma acquired it genetically. This disease is an autosomal dominant gene. If only two family members have melanoma, there is a 5% chance somebody in the next generation will acquire the mutated gene. Also, there is a 20-40% chance of getting hereditary melanoma in a family if 3 or more people in the past generation had melanoma. For those who carry the hereditary mutated gene CDKN2A, acquiring skin cancer is a <b>lot</b> <b>easier.</b> Those who have the gene {{are far more likely to}} get melanoma a second or third time compared to those who don’t genetically have this gene. The population that is affected by this mutation has a high familial history of melanoma or atypical moles and birth marks in large numbers, a history of primary melanoma/cancers in general, immunosuppression, skin that burns easily and doesn't tan, freckling, blue eyes, red hair, or a history of blistering. People with these high risk factors are more likely to carry inherited mutations in CDKN2A. For those who have a gene mutation, the severity is also dependent on the environmental surroundings. Out of those who carry the gene, those who express the phenotype and actually developed melanoma have a history of more sun exposure, and light skin compared to those who also had the gene but never actually developed melanoma. This suggests that this gene co-works with ones surrounding environment. If two individuals are selected who carry the CDKN2A mutation, and both genetically have the same probability of acquiring skin cancer, but one is from Australia and the other is from Europe, there is a 58% the European will acquire cancer compared to a 91% chance the Australian will get it. This is because the factors mentioned earlier pertaining to those who are more susceptible to the disease and also dependent on the amount of sunscreen one wears and the UV radiation potency in their environment.|$|E
