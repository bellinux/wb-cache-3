The team suffered first round exits in two of the cup competitions they entered: in the second round of the League Cup and the third round of the FA Cup. Kenwyne Jones was the club's top goalscorer, recording 7goals in the league. Left-back Danny Collins was named as Sunderland's player of the season, while on loan centre-back Jonny Evans was named as the club's young player of the season for the second season running. The club's average attendance of 42,728 was the fifth highest in the division.|$|E

25|$|Ince was {{expected}} to retire {{at the end of}} the 2004–05 season, but he changed his mind halfway through the season following the appointment of Glenn Hoddle as manager of a Wolves side who were struggling at the wrong end of the league. Wolves climbed up to ninth in the final table, proving themselves very hard to beat under Hoddle's management, although they drew too many games to be able to make a <b>late</b> <b>run</b> to the playoff places. In June 2005, he signed a new one-year contract with Wolves. In April 2006, he announced that he wanted to continue playing for Wolves for a further season after speaking with his close friend Teddy Sheringham. However, following Ince's failure to get the manager's job at Wolves in July 2006 on Hoddle's resignation, the newly appointed manager, Mick McCarthy, decided not to offer Ince a new contract. Upon leaving, Ince declared his intention to return, at some point in the future, as manager of Wolves.|$|E
25|$|Scala's Parma led Serie B at the half-way mark and, {{despite the}} {{distress}} of a stadium disaster {{in a home}} match against Reggina in January {{and the death of}} owner Ernesto Ceresin in February seeing the Ducali fall to eighth, a <b>late</b> <b>run</b> of form and victory on the final day against old Derby del Grana rivals Reggiana with goals from fan favourite and right winger Marco Osio and forward Alessandro Melli meant Parma secured a historic promotion to Serie A on 27 May 1990. After Parma's promotion, Calisto Tanzi increased his stake in the ownership of the club to 45% with the purchase of the deceased Ceresin's sons' shares and named Giorgio Pedraneschi as president. This would allow Scala to supplement the squad that achieved promotion from Serie B, which included central defenders Luigi Apolloni and Lorenzo Minotti – Minotti also went on to captain the side – and star striker Alessandro Melli, with players such as Tomas Brolin, Claudio Taffarel and Georges Grun.|$|E
25|$|On 20 May, Macaroni was a 10/1 {{chance for}} the Derby at Epsom, with Lord Clifden {{starting}} the 4/1 favourite {{in a field of}} thirty-one. The race was run in difficult conditions with heavy rain and soft ground. Among the spectators was the Prince of Wales, who became the first member of the British Royal Family to attend the race since Prince Albert in 1840. The start of the race was delayed for almost an hour, owing to a record thirty-two false starts caused by horses breaking away or failing to line up correctly. The huge field led to good deal of bumping and roughness, with three horses either falling or being brought down. Chaloner held up Macaroni in the early stages, before moving into fifth place entering the straight. A furlong from the finish, Lord Clifden went into a clear lead and looked the likely winner, but Macaroni produced a strong <b>late</b> <b>run</b> to catch the favourite in the last strides and win by a head. Rapid Rhone finished well to take third place. Macaroni's victory was warmly received in Newmarket, where the church bells were rung in celebration. Naylor marked his success by donating £1,000 to charities in his native city of Liverpool.|$|E

25|$|Lee {{left at the}} end of {{the season}} and was {{replaced}} by Roy McFarland, who only managed to deliver a mediocre 19th-place finish the following season; McFarland subsequently quit {{at the end of}} the season, in protest of Mike Bateson's decision to sack assistant manager David Preece without consulting McFarland, who was replaced by Leroy Rosenior. 2002–03 would see a major improvement over the previous two campaigns and a finish of 9th place, with only a <b>late</b> <b>run</b> of bad results keeping Torquay out of the play-offs. The end of the 2003–04 season saw United win automatic promotion for the third time in their history, against all odds in a nail-biting finale at Southend. However their stay in the third tier of the football pyramid was only to last for one season, as a final day defeat against Colchester United condemned the Gulls to a return to the 4th division of the leagues after narrowly being edged out by Milton Keynes Dons for safety in Football League One. The fact that it was the MK Dons that had stayed up at Torquay's expense saw messages of sympathy from fans of other clubs, mainly out of a dislike for the franchising of football.|$|E
25|$|Successful former Rangers manager Walter Smith {{took over}} from Kendall {{in the summer}} of 1998 and big things were {{expected}} along with some high-profile signings but his first season saw another relegation battle, and only a <b>late</b> <b>run</b> of four wins from their final six games saw them earn safety a 14th-place finish. During the 1998–99 season striker Duncan Ferguson was sold to Newcastle United without Smith's knowledge. The resulting outrage from supporters regarding the manner of the sale lead to chairman Peter Johnson stepping down from his post. Theatrical producer Bill Kenwright bought control of the club and installed Philip Carter as the new chairman. Smith's chances of success were hampered by continuing financial constraints which had also contributed to the club's decline in previous years. 1999–2000 proved to be a better campaign, and the club looked to have an outside chance of qualifying for the UEFA Cup for much of the season. In the reverse of the previous year though, Everton fell apart in the final months of the campaign, claiming just two victories from their last twelve games and finishing in 13th, just one place higher than the previous year. 2000–01 saw a major step back however, and the club once again fell into a relegation battle, not helped by long-term injuries to several key players.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the start}} of the 2015 season, plenty of changes took place at the club. Matthew Maynard stepped into the role of Director of Cricket after the club parted ways with Nosworthy. With the loss of Kieswetter, Somerset also lost another senior batsman in Compton as he moved back to London. Alfonso Thomas became captain in one-day {{competitions}} with Trescothick remaining as club and First-class captain. Somerset also made some new signings, including Chris Gayle for {{the start of}} the t20 Blast. For the most part the season followed much the same path as the last, with Somerset failing to reach the latter stages of either limited overs competition and battling for the lower places in the Championship. Despite Gayle providing 328 runs in his three innings with the club, Somerset languished second from bottom in the t20 Blast. With Thomas sent out on loan, new signing Jim Allenby took over the captaincy for the One-Day Cup and despite winning their last three matches, Somerset missed out on a quarter-final spot. In the Championship Somerset looked to be in relegation trouble for much of the season, but led by a <b>late</b> <b>run</b> of form from Trescothick and thanks to a maximum points victory in their final game, Somerset avoided the drop by a margin of 22 points and finished 6th in Division One for the third consecutive year. James Hildreth was the leading Championship run scorer in Division One.|$|E

500|$|Former {{team captain}} Andy Hessenthaler was {{appointed}} player-manager, having previously served as player-coach, {{and led the}} club to league finishes of 13th, 12th and 11th in his first three seasons in charge.

[...] John Gorman was appointed to help Hessenthaler as the side started the 2004–05 season poorly, but as the team continued to struggle at {{the wrong end of}} the table Hessenthaler resigned as manager in late November. Somewhat unusually he continued to be employed as a player. [...] Gorman succeeded Hessenthaler in a caretaker capacity but left the club to take the manager's job at Wycombe Wanderers.

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 Genetic {{differences}} between {{early and late}} forms of Alaskan chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were identified using two genetic approaches: mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analysis and protein electrophoresis. The study populations consisted of early- and late-run chinook salmon {{in each of the}} Kenai and Kasilof rivers in Alaska, and a single population from the Minam River, Oregon, that provided a relative scale for the differences among the Alaskan populations. Two segments of mtDNA were amplified separately using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and then digested with 14 to 16 restriction enzymes. Results showed that the two early runs were genetically similar to each other but different from either of the <b>late</b> <b>runs.</b> The <b>late</b> <b>runs</b> were different from each other based on the frequency of the common haplotypes. The Minam River stock shared two haplotypes with the Alaskan stocks and displayed one unique haplotype. The frequency difference in the shared haplotypes together with the presence of a unique haplotype allowed us to separate the Oregon population from those in Alaska. In the protein analysis, each of the five populations was examined at 30 allozyme loci to determine variation within and between the runs. Based on 14 polymorphic loci, Minam River chinook salmon were genetically distinct from the Alaskan populations. Within the Alaskan populations, the two early runs were most similar to each other but different from the two late runs; the two <b>late</b> <b>runs</b> were also genetically most similar to each other. Based on all loci, protein electrophoresis proved to be a useful technique to separate stocks of chinook salmon. On a locus by locus basis, however, mtDNA was more powerful. Both mtDNA and allozyme analysis suggest that chinook salmon may segregate into genetically different early and late forms within a drainage...|$|R
