500|$|Beahan {{had been}} {{thinking}} of releasing a tribute record through his company for a long time, {{following the death of}} musicians Arthur Lee and Syd Barrett in 2006. However, he changed his mind and instead chose Madonna, believing her songs could be recorded as serious sounding tracks, thereby eliminating chances of it being a novelty release. The idea for Through the Wilderness originated from an epiphany Beahan had about Madonna. Although not a fan of the singer, he was intrigued about how her songs would sound when treated by alternative musicians. [...] "The Madonna tribute came to me in a dream <b>last</b> <b>fall,</b> <b>and</b> I immediately started making calls and emails to Winter Flowers, Chapin Sisters, and Banhart asking them to record a song for it," [...] Beahan clarified to Spin magazine.|$|E
