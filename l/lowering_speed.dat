ER9p-101 electric trainset {{was equipped with}} such a brake. This train was tested on experimental circle track of CNII of Railroad Ministry. The rheostatic braking was in use for <b>lowering</b> <b>speed</b> from 130 km/h down to 50 km/h. Then regular electro-pneumatic braking was in use. After that, the electric trainset entered Gorky Depot for a permanent use. It worked on common schedule with other ER9p electric trainsets.|$|E

Designed primarily for canyoneering, the Pirana allows {{for a variety of}} friction modes and, therefore, lowering speeds. The Pirana supports three different braking positions, each supplying a different amount of friction, thereby changing the <b>lowering</b> <b>speed.</b> In contrast to the Figure 8, the Pirana can be loaded or disconnected from the rope without having to be removed from the carabiner.|$|E
50|$|Many commuters {{pass through}} the city {{on their way to}} {{downtown}} Orlando. These commuters come from outlying suburban areas such as Oviedo, Winter Springs, Maitland, Altamonte Springs, Longwood and Casselberry. Winter Park's municipal government has sought to reduce speeding and aggressive driving in its downtown core and residential areas by <b>lowering</b> <b>speed</b> limits to 20 mph in some areas, adding textured traffic-calming brick roads, and aggressively enforcing the law. These measures have added traffic congestion, but preserve {{the quality of life for}} residents and encourage pass-thru commuters to seek alternate, high-speed routes to downtown (such as SR436/Semoran Blvd, Lake Howell Road, US17-92/Orlando Ave, Interstate 4, and the 408/East West Expressway and 417/Greeneway toll roads).|$|E

50|$|The great {{majority}} of the route mileage has permitted line speeds between 55 and 60 miles per hour (mph), with shorter sections of both higher and <b>lower</b> <b>speeds.</b> Junctions are no faster than 30 mph, with significant numbers rated at <b>lower</b> <b>speeds,</b> down to 10 mph in some cases.|$|R
50|$|Slow {{steaming}} {{was adopted}} in 2007 {{in the face}} of rapidly rising fuel oil costs (July 2007 to July 2008: 350 to 700 USD/tonne). According to Maersk Line, who introduced the practice in 2009-2010, slow steaming is conducted at 18 kn. Speeds of 14 to 16 kn were used on Asia-Europe backhaul routes in 2010. Speeds under 18 kn are called super slow steaming. Marine engine manufacturer Wärtsilä calculates that fuel consumption can be reduced by 59% by reducing cargo ship speed from 27 knots to 18 kn, at the cost of an additional week's sailing time on Asia-Europe routes. It adds a comparable 4-7 days to trans-Pacific voyages. <b>Lowering</b> <b>speed</b> reduces fuel consumption because the drag imparted by a fluid increases quadratically with increase in speed. Thus traveling twice as fast requires four times as much energy (and therefore fuel) for a given distance, which is why driving an automobile at 50 mph requires less than 85% of the power required by the same automobile driving at 60 mph. Although lowering speeds lowers the power requirements, the total practical amount of speed reduction is limited by other factors, such as economically viable total voyage time, and the fact that a ships engine and propeller are designed to operate within a certain range of RPMs. Attempting to steam too slowly will place the engine and propeller outside their most efficient range, and will therefore begin to counteract the benefits. Although some ships are being placed in service that are designed to steam most efficiently at slower speeds, the great cost of building a ship and need to remain competitive means that radical changes are unlikely until conditions merit such a risk.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{question}} of how the duration of karstic denudation depends on the dip angle, the annual amount of precipitation, the rain intensity, and the prevailing wind direction and speed in case of an initially plane, sloping limestone surface without soil cover. The answer is given by the solution of a differential equation system describing the <b>lowering</b> <b>speed</b> of the rock surface. It turns out that the rate of the denudation does not increase in proportion to the intensity of precipitation and that it can never exceed a maximal value. Furthermore, long, soft rains result in higher annual denudation than short, abundant downpours. With increasing wind-speed the corrosion rate also increases, but above a certain wind speed the dissolution does not become faster. This paper presents numerical examples with diagrams about how these factors affect the expected duration of denudation...|$|E

30|$|These {{lines of}} argumentation {{do not follow}} {{organizational}} boundaries, but rather coincide with specific responsibilities and mandates. For example, general traffic planners in the respective organizations tend to prioritize mobility, while traffic safety engineers in various organizations are predominantly concerned with issues of traffic safety. It is, however, somewhat remarkable that public actors who have a mandate to monitor both regional and local development and road safety—i.e. leading municipal politicians, officials in the regional development council, and planners in the former SRA—share the strongest commitment to regional development and economic growth, even though these goals might be attained {{at the expense of}} a higher rate of road accidents. In other words, the strong commitment to high speeds, as well as the explicit resistance to <b>lowering</b> <b>speed</b> limits in many cases, detracts from other policy efforts to reach national road safety targets at the regional and local level where decisions about speed limits on particular roads are made.|$|E
30|$|The {{level of}} task {{automation}} has {{an influence on}} resource demands as well. In the present study, travel-information needs to be attended to during driving, the latter being a highly automated task for experienced drivers. The visual channel is most important for the driver and the concurrent execution of a visual task, like in-vehicle looking at a cell phone, competes for visual attention with the primary driving task [2]. But auditory (or motor or cognitive) tasks potentially create some conflict with monitoring and processing visual information as well. Because of this competition for limited resources, driving performance may decline. Alternatively, compensation may be sought by the driver, for instance by <b>lowering</b> <b>speed.</b> Therefore, several ways of providing information were investigated in order to find out if, and how, driving behaviour, performance and safety are affected. Additionally, the study aims to find out whether there are differences in information processing or in preferences between native Dutch speakers and non-native Dutch speakers.|$|E

40|$|<b>Lowering</b> <b>speed</b> of car drivers {{will have}} {{positive}} impacts on environmental pollution {{and the number}} of road accidents. It is therefore a potentially interesting policy option for governments which want to reduce negative externalities of transport. In this paper the acceptance of such polities is analyzed by means of a survey questionnaire among car drivers and public transport users. First, an analysis is presented on the general speed behaviour, the behaviour on distinct road types, the acceptance of lower limits, and the acceptance and perception of electronic speed limiters. Next, a statistical analysis of subgroups is carried out. It is concluded that the speed of car drivers is in general not considered as a main problematic issue by drivers and non-drivers; therefore there is little scope for the acceptance of changes in speed polities. When speed polities are changed (lower limits) it seems most effective to emphasize safety aspects in order to increase support of the public. However, psychological factors of speed behaviour may {{play an important role in}} this respect. ...|$|E
40|$|Recently, an {{offshore}} support vessel is being widely used to install {{an offshore}} structure {{such as a}} subsea equipment which is laid on its deck. The lifting operation {{which is one of}} the installation operations includes lifting off, lifting in the air, splash zone crossing, deep submerging, and finally landing of the structure with an offshore support vessel crane. There are some major considerations during this operation. Especially, when lifting off the structure, if operating conditions such as ocean environmental loads and hoisting (or <b>lowering)</b> <b>speed</b> are bad, the excess of tension of wire ropes of the crane and the collision between the offshore support vessel and the structure can be occurred due to the relative motion between them. To solve this problem, this study performs the lifting simulation while the offshore support vessel installs the structure. The simulation includes the calculation of dynamic responses of the offshore support vessel and the equipment, including the wire tension and the collision detection. To check the applicability of the simulation, it is applied to some lifting steps by varying operating conditions. As a result, it is confirmed that the conditions affect the operability of those steps...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{concerned}} with gaining {{a greater understanding of}} the Australian community's attitudes towards both the current and proposed lower speed limits. An online survey was administered in four states (Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania), with a total of 4100 respondents recruited. The survey focussed on attitudes towards speed limits for four different road types, and the sample was stratified according to age, gender, and area of residence. It was found that most respondents were able to correctly identify the speed limit for local residential streets and major urban arterials, although their knowledge of rural speed limits was considerably lower. The majority of respondents were in favour of the proposed lower speed limits on 100 km/h two-lane undivided rural roads and on rural gravel roads, but only about one-third supported lower limits in urban areas. A cluster analysis revealed that there were varying characteristics between respondents who were more or less likely to support speed limit reductions, across a number of demographic, socio-economic status, and driving behavior variables. These results provided important guidance regarding groups that could potentially be targeted in speed-related interventions, as well as highlighting the potential for <b>lowering</b> <b>speed</b> limits in Australia, particularly on rural roads.
