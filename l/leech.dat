5|$|George Cruikshank, the {{illustrator}} who {{had previously}} worked with Dickens on Sketches by Boz (1836) and Oliver Twist (1838), {{introduced him to the}} caricaturist John <b>Leech.</b> By 24 October Dickens invited <b>Leech</b> to work on A Christmas Carol, and four hand-coloured etchings and four black-and-white wood engravings by the artist accompanied the text.|$|E
5|$|The {{second child}} of Johnstone Melmore and Jessie Francis <b>Leech,</b> <b>Leech</b> {{was born in}} Bendigo in Australia. She was given the name Faith after her elder sister, who died from leukaemia {{at the age of}} two. A {{delicate}} child, <b>Leech</b> had an aversion to eating {{in the first two years}} of her life, so her mother fed her in small hourly doses. <b>Leech</b> was twice rushed from the family home to a Melbourne hospital. Conventional medicine failed to rectify Leech's dietary issues, so her mother put her on a fast for ten days at the recommendation of a naturopath. <b>Leech</b> was later placed on a diet of fruit, salad and vegetables, with an emphasis on beetroot juice and carrot juice.|$|E
5000|$|Manchester Royal Infirmary used 50,000 <b>leeches</b> {{a year in}} 1831. The {{price of}} <b>leeches</b> varied between one penny and threepence halfpenny each. In 1832 <b>leeches</b> {{accounted}} for 4.4% of the total hospital expenditure. The hospital maintained an aquarium for <b>leeches</b> until the 1930s.|$|R

50|$|<b>Leeches</b> became {{especially}} {{popular in}} the early nineteenth century. In the 1830s, the French imported about forty million <b>leeches</b> a year for medical purposes, and in the next decade, England imported six million <b>leeches</b> a year from France alone. Through {{the early decades of the}} century, hundreds of millions of <b>leeches</b> were used by physicians throughout Europe.|$|R
5|$|This {{pattern was}} {{repeated}} in the final. Fraser and Crapp were {{far ahead of the}} field, finishing in 1 minute 2.0 seconds and 1 minute 2.3 seconds, respectively. <b>Leech</b> overtook the United States' Joan Rosazza in the final 25 metres to take bronze in 1 minute 5.1 seconds. The race for third place had been tight, with just 0.7 of a second separating <b>Leech</b> and the final finisher. The youngest swimmer in the field, <b>Leech</b> had come through to claim the last podium position. <b>Leech</b> said that it was an emotional occasion, having seen the Australian men take a trifecta in the corresponding event on the previous night of racing.|$|E
5|$|As the Australians boasted {{the three}} fastest {{swimmers}} {{in the individual}} 100-metre freestyle event, they were clear favourites for the corresponding relay, especially as Fraser and Crapp were three seconds faster {{than all of the}} other swimmers. <b>Leech</b> was not assured of a place in the final quartet. In the heats, Fraser and Crapp were rested and the remaining four swimmers, Sandra Morgan, Elizabeth Fraser, Gibson and <b>Leech</b> qualified the team. <b>Leech</b> swam the second leg in 1 minute 5.9 seconds, the second fastest of the Australians, thereby securing her position in the final along with Sandra Morgan, who recorded a time of 1 minute 5.4 seconds. Australia won the second heat by 3.1 seconds to qualify quickest for the final. They were 1.8 and 2.3 seconds faster than South Africa and the United States, respectively, both of whom swam in the first heat. The selection of <b>Leech</b> and Morgan generated controversy. They were Australia's youngest swimmers and lacked experience at open level competition: Morgan had false started twice at the Australian Championships, and both had competed at national level only once.|$|E
5|$|From 1954, <b>Leech</b> {{attended}} St. Michael's Girls' Grammar School {{and trained}} with Froelich {{on a daily}} basis at the City Baths. The regular sessions paid off at the 1955 Victorian Championships; <b>Leech</b> won the open 110- and 220-yard freestyle in times of 1 minute 7.2 seconds and 2 minutes 39.3 seconds, respectively, setting state records in both events. She proceeded to the Australian Championships, winning the 110-yard freestyle in 1 minute 7.6 seconds to become the youngest ever winner of an open title at the age of 13. <b>Leech</b> also won the national junior 110- and 220-yard events.|$|E
50|$|<b>Leeches</b> are {{presumed to}} have evolved from certain Oligochaeta, {{most of which}} feed on detritus. However, some species in the Lumbriculidae are predatory and have similar adaptations as found in <b>leeches.</b> As a consequence, the {{systematics}} and taxonomy of <b>leeches</b> {{is in need of}} review. While <b>leeches</b> form a clade, the remaining oligochaetes are not their sister taxon, but in a diverse paraphyletic group containing some lineages that are closely related to <b>leeches,</b> and others that are far more distant.|$|R

50|$|<b>Leeches</b> are hermaphrodites, meaning {{each has}} both {{female and male}} {{reproductive}} organs (ovaries and testes, respectively). <b>Leeches</b> reproduce by reciprocal fertilization, and sperm transfer occurs during copulation. Like earthworms, <b>leeches</b> use a clitellum to hold their eggs and secrete the cocoon.|$|R
5|$|Frustrated at the competition's outcome, <b>Leech</b> on June 11, 1891 {{instructed}} Barber {{to prepare}} {{designs for the}} half dollar, quarter, and dime. As the Morgan dollar was then being heavily struck, the Mint director decided to leave that design unaltered for the time being. For the obverse of the new coins, <b>Leech</b> suggested a depiction of Liberty similar to that on the French coins of the period; he was content that the current reverses be continued. <b>Leech</b> had previously suggested to Barber that he engage outside help if the work was {{to be done at}} the Mint; the chief engraver replied that he was aware of no one who could be of help in the preparation of new designs. <b>Leech</b> had spoken with Saint-Gaudens on the same subject; the sculptor stated that only four men in the world were capable of executing high-quality coin designs; three lived in France and he was the fourth.|$|E
5|$|Having {{arrived at}} the Olympics, <b>Leech</b> made her debut in the 100-metre freestyle, an event in which she, Fraser and Crapp were {{regarded}} as the three strongest competitors, although the latter two {{were considered to be}} substantially stronger. All three won their heats. <b>Leech</b> won her heat by 1.6 seconds in a time of 1 minute 4.9 seconds. She was third fastest qualifier behind Fraser and Crapp, who were over 1.5 seconds faster. Drawn in Fraser's semifinal, <b>Leech</b> finished second in a time of 1 minute 5.2 seconds, and was the third fastest qualifier for the final behind her compatriots. The semifinals followed a similar pattern to the heats, with Fraser and Crapp more than two seconds ahead of the six remaining qualifiers, who were separated by just 0.8 of a second.|$|E

40|$|<b>Leeches</b> are {{fascinating}} creatures: {{they have}} simple modular nervous circuitry m yet exhibit a rich spectrum of behavioural modes. <b>Leeches</b> could be ideal blue-prints for designing flexible soft robots which are modular, multi-functional, fault-tolerant, easy to control, capable for navigating using optical, mechanical and chemical sensorial inputs, have autonomous inter-segmental coordination and adaptive decision-making. With future designs of leech-robots in mind we study how <b>leeches</b> behave in geometrically constrained spaces. Core {{results of the}} paper deal with <b>leeches</b> exploring a row of rooms arranged along a narrow corridor. In laboratory experiments we find that rooms closer to ends of the corridor are explored by <b>leeches</b> more often than rooms {{in the middle of}} the corridor. Also, in series of scoping experiments, we evaluate <b>leeches</b> capabilities to navigating in mazes towards sources of vibration and chemo-attraction. We believe our results lay foundation for future developments of robots mimicking behaviour of <b>leeches...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Leeches,</b> fed on swine {{infected}} with hog cholera, contained virus {{for as long}} as 87 days after their infective blood meals. In three instances, infected <b>leeches</b> apparently transmitted hog cholera virus to susceptible swine in the process of normal feeding. Myxoma virus persisted in <b>leeches</b> {{for as long as}} 154 days after the ingestion of a blood meal from rabbits with myxomatosis. <b>Leeches</b> fed consecutively, first on swine with hog cholera, and later on rabbits with myxomatosis, acquired both viruses. In such dually infected <b>leeches,</b> the hog cholera virus persisted for as long as 122 days and the myxoma virus for as long as 110 days, the longest periods tested. <b>Leeches</b> fed consecutively, first on rabbits with myxomatosis, and later on swine with hog cholera, acquired only the myxoma virus. Hog cholera virus could not be demonstrated in such dually fed <b>leeches.</b> Myxoma and hog cholera viruses appeared to be present in about equivalent amounts in the anterior and posterior thirds of the bodies of infected <b>leeches.</b> Myxoma and hog cholera viruses were present in the bloody gut contents of infected <b>leeches</b> but were not demonstrable in the body tissues of these <b>leeches.</b> It seems from the findings presented that <b>leeches</b> are not biological carriers of either myxoma or hog cholera virus but instead carry these two agents mechanically in their gastrointestinal tracts. In doing this, they appear to protect the viruses from various deleterious chemical and physical influences to which they would have been exposed in the open. It is speculated that <b>leeches</b> could play a role in nature in perpetuating the blood-borne viruses of certain diseases in which close association with bodies of fresh water is of epidemiological importance...|$|R
5|$|<b>Leech</b> {{was named}} in the Olympic squad and the Australian Swimming Union {{exempted}} her from travelling to the national training camp in Townsville so she could train with Froelich, who understood her special dietary requirements. She joined the squad for the final race trials in Melbourne in October before the Olympics. Fraser and Crapp were too strong in the 100-metre freestyle, with <b>Leech</b> finishing second and third in the two races. After combining with Fraser, Crapp and Margaret Gibson to break the world record for the 4×100-metre freestyle relay, <b>Leech</b> was selected as one of Australia's three entrants in the 100-metre freestyle events and one of six swimmers for the 4×100-metre freestyle relay squad for the Olympics.|$|E

5|$|The {{selection}} of <b>Leech</b> and Morgan for the 6 December final generated controversy, {{as they were}} the two youngest swimmers in the squad and lacked experience at open level competition. Both had competed only once at senior Australian level; Morgan had twice false started at the 1956 Australian Championships, while <b>Leech</b> had been too ill to compete. Australia was the favourite for the relay, having swept the medals in the individual 100-metre event; Fraser, Crapp and <b>Leech</b> finished first, second and third. The favouritism was even more marked because Fraser and Crapp were three seconds faster than {{everyone else in the}} world.|$|E
40|$|<b>Leeches</b> {{exploring}} {{a new environment}} continuously meet each other and merge in temporary groups. After 2 – 3 [*]h, <b>leeches</b> become attracted to each other eventually forming a large and stable group. When their number is reduced, <b>leeches</b> remain solitary, behaving independently. Group formation is facilitated by body injection of serotonin (5 -HT) {{and the level of}} endogenous 5 -HT is elevated in <b>leeches</b> forming a large group. In contrast, intravenous injection of 5 -HT antagonists prevented injected <b>leeches</b> from joining a large group of conspecifics. When sensilla near the head were ablated or the supraesophageal ganglion disconnected, <b>leeches</b> remained solitary, but explored the environment swimming and crawling. These results suggest that group formation is initiated by a release of 5 -HT triggered by sensilla stimulation and its dynamics {{can be explained by the}} establishment of a reinforcement dynamics, as observed during human group formation. As 5 -HT affects social interactions also in humans, group formation in <b>leeches</b> and humans share a similar dynamics and hormonal control...|$|R

40|$|In the Atlantic Rainforest of the Parque Estadual da Serra do Tabuleiro, {{state of}} Santa Catarina, {{southern}} Brazil, we found Rhinella abei (Bufonidae) infested by <b>leeches</b> (Hirudinoidea). We captured 27 toads {{on the margin}} of a lagoon {{both inside and outside}} water in a survey carried out during one night, and 13 of which had a total of 30 <b>leeches</b> (mean intensity of infestation = 2. 3 ± 1. 3). We did not observe wounds, scars and/or hemorrhages caused by the <b>leeches</b> on the toads examined, no hemorrhaging after the removal of the <b>leeches,</b> and the <b>leeches</b> removed from the toads were empty of blood. This evidence led us to theorize that the <b>leeches</b> were not parasitizing the toads but had a phoretic relationship. The <b>leeches</b> were found on both dorsal and ventral surfaces (13 on each) of the toads and were predominantly on the toads’ axils followed by back and thighs. The average snout-vent length of the toads was 69. 2 ± 5. 3 mm and their average body mass was 27. 1 ± 6. 9 g. The number of <b>leeches</b> found on a toad was not related to its snout-vent length or body mass. We are unaware of any previous records of <b>leeches</b> using anurans as dispersal agents, as suggested in the present study...|$|R

5|$|A {{tall and}} lean swimmer {{known for her}} elegant technique, <b>Leech</b> started {{swimming}} as a child to build strength {{after a series of}} stomach disorders in her infancy. She quickly rose to prominence after breaking a string of age group records. In 1955, she became the youngest swimmer to win an Australian title, claiming victory in the 110-yard freestyle at the age of 13. She twice broke the Australian record in the 100-yard freestyle in late 1955, thereby positioning herself as a leading contender for Olympic selection in 1956. Leech's preparation was hindered by illness, which forced her out of the 1956 Australian Championships, but she recovered to gain Olympic selection in both the 100-metre freestyle and the corresponding relay. <b>Leech</b> produced a late surge to take bronze in the individual event and seal an Australian trifecta, before swimming the second leg in the relay to help secure an Australian victory in world record time. <b>Leech</b> retired after the Olympics at the age of 15; she cited anxiety caused by racing as one of the main factors in her decision.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1880s, there were {{increasing}} {{calls for the}} replacement of the Seated Liberty design, used since the 1830s on most denominations of silver coins. In 1891, Mint Director Edward O. <b>Leech,</b> having been authorized by Congress to approve coin redesigns, ordered a competition, seeking a new look for the silver coins. As only the winner would receive a cash prize, invited artists refused to participate and no entry from the public proved suitable. <b>Leech</b> instructed Barber to prepare new designs for the dime, quarter, and half dollar, and after the chief engraver made changes to secure Leech's endorsement, they were approved by President Benjamin Harrison in November 1891. Striking of the new coins began the following January.|$|E
