25|$|The {{parabolic}} form of St Paul's {{was made}} possible by the use of glued <b>laminated</b> <b>timber</b> for the internal arches. <b>Laminated</b> <b>timber</b> arches, constructed by overlapping and bolting together small pieces of timber to make a single, large member, have been in use in Australia since the mid-19th century. Cost-effective and able to span large distances without intermediate posts, <b>laminated</b> <b>timber</b> arches also became an alternative system for roof structures of large buildings such as markets, factories and, from the early 20th century, large auditoria and picture theatres. The process of glue lamination, using casein glue to bond the layers of timber rather than bolts, originated in Germany before being introduced to the United States in the 1920s. Several publications in the 1930s and early 1940s provided the necessary data for constructing glued <b>laminated</b> <b>timber</b> arches, and became a source of inspiration for Australian designers. The earliest experiments in Australia took place in the early 1940s and the arrival of powerful synthetic resin adhesives in the post- World War II period increased the reliability and range of applications of glue lamination. The former Burge Bros Factory in Melbourne (1945–46) is considered to be the oldest known surviving example of this technology in Australia, with semi-circular arches spanning 30 metres, manufactured by Sydney-based company Ralph Symonds Ltd.|$|E

Proper {{design and construction}} techniques include protection of the wood from moisture {{or the use of}} pressure preservative treatments when protection from moisture is not possible [1, 2]. The advent of glued <b>laminated</b> <b>timbers</b> brought new design opportunities for wood structures. Unfortunately, some of these structures were not constructed in accordance with these recognized principles of designing for permanence, and problems have occurred. This technical note was developed to address problems of decay found in such structures. It discusses inspection for and repair of decayed portions of the structure and provides guidelines for preventing reoccurrence of decay. INSPECTION All buildings should be inspected periodically to make sure that roofs, downspouts, etc., are functioning properly and members are not being inadvertently subjected to excessive moisture. Members which have been exposed to moisture due to roof leakage or drainage problems should be inspected carefully. Water from leakage or improper drainage can elevate the moisture content of <b>laminated</b> <b>timbers,</b> promoting decay.

30|$|Acetaldehyde {{is one of}} the {{metabolic}} intermediates in humans, many other animals and higher plants, as well as a product of alcohol fermentation. It has been identified in foods, beverages, cigarette smoke and vehicle exhausts, as well as while burning gas, fuel, oil and coal [1, 2]. Conversely, acetaldehyde is ranked as Group 2 B, possibly carcinogenic, for human carcinogenicity by the International Agency for Research on Cancer [3]. It is also listed in the guidelines of indoor air quality in Japan as a harmful chemical substance for human health [4]. According to the government survey of indoor air quality for newly constructed houses in Japan from 2002 to 2005 [5], levels of acetaldehyde exceeding the guideline value (48  μg/m 3) were detected in about 10 % of all newly constructed houses. However, the origin of acetaldehyde emission in indoor air remains unclear. In the survey, as wooden houses showed higher acetaldehyde values compared to non-wooden houses, wood materials were suspected as a major origin of acetaldehyde emission in houses [5]. Furthermore, several papers reported that some glued <b>laminated</b> <b>timbers</b> showed extraordinarily large acetaldehyde emissions [6 – 10]. We tried to elucidate the origin of acetaldehyde emission from glued <b>laminated</b> <b>timbers</b> and found that ethanol used as a partial solvent in phenol–resorcinol–formaldehyde resin adhesives caused the acetaldehyde emission [11]. This means that the interaction between ethanol and wood became a trigger for acetaldehyde emission from wood materials.|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} {{strength}} test of solid and glue <b>laminated</b> <b>timbers</b> represented by Kapur, Teak and Red Meranti {{are reported in}} this paper. The method used for the testing was the ASTM D 143 - 1970. For {{the purpose of the}} test, 8 x 12 x 400 cm lumbers of the three species were divided into two groups being de- signated respectively for test in solid and glue laminated form. The first group were tested for modulus of rupture, com- pression parallel to the grain and shear strength under air dry condition. In bending tests, two methods of loading were applied, namely perpendicular and parallel to the laminae in case of glue <b>laminated</b> <b>timbers,</b> and along radial or tangential direction for solid timbers. The second group were resawn further into 0. 9 cm and 1. 9 cm thick timber strips, respectioely, for small size tests of the glue laminated specimens. The 0. 9 cm thick strips which were air-dried and then glued with CIBA Phenol resorcinol-formal-dehyde adhesives, were designated for test on modulus of rupture and compression. The 1. 9 cm thick strips were divided further into five batches, and each of which were dried respectively until 25, 20, 15, 10 and 5 percent moisture content before glueing with the above mentioned adhesive into six different combination of test pieces namely Teah-Meranti (JM), Teak-Kapur (JK), Meranti-Kapur (MK), Kapur-kapur (KK), Teak-Teak (JJ) and meranti-Meranti (MM).

25|$|Despite the {{technology}} being available, it wasn't until the 1950s, when curved shapes such as conoids and hyperbolic parabolas became fashionable, that glue laminated arches were {{more commonly used}} in Australia, particularly for church structures. Recognising the structural and aesthetic potential of this new technology, Oribin specified glue <b>laminated</b> <b>timber</b> arches for two of his earliest buildings, the Mareeba Shire Hall and Proserpine's St Paul's Church; both were designed in 1956 and completed within 5 years, making them an early use of {{the technology}} in Queensland.

500|$|As the {{production}} of state sponsored housing subsided in the 1970s, there was a return to conservatism in church design, which may have reflected a loss {{of confidence in the}} churches as attendances rapidly declined. M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie have identified a [...] "post-Coia" [...] style emerging in this period. The limited number of new buildings, some replacing existing churches, tended to be produced by building companies using <b>laminated</b> <b>timber</b> beams, exposed brickwork and pyramidal roofs to produce utilitarian, if aesthetically unadventurous, constructions. From the late 1980s there were some original designs, including St Mary the Virgin, in Port Glasgow (1984) by Frank Burnet, Bell and Partners; St Anthony's Catholic church in Kirriemuir (1987), by James F. Stephen Architects; and the replacement church at St Joseph's Catholic Church, Faifley (1997) by Jacobsen and French. There was also the postmodern design of St John Ogalvy Catholic Church, Irvine (1982), and the nearby Girdle Toll parish church (1992), which was converted from a farmhouse.|$|E

It {{is likely that}} this was a rebuilt version of the first engine, with the original brass cylinder replaced with a larger 22 in bore one of cast iron with a stroke of 5 ft. The engine was capable of pumping at 12 strokes per minute, moving 68,200 litres of water every hour. The engine was not large, even for its time, and used a simple 12 ft one-piece wooden beam, without additional struts or being made of multiple <b>laminated</b> <b>timbers.</b> It was also carried on a timber frame, rather than being house-built.

500|$|Saltersford locks {{were built}} in 1874, using red {{sandstone}} and limestone, and replaced a lock built on the Barnton cut between 1832 and 1835. The Pelton turbines which control the gates were built to Stoney's patent, and carry plates which indicate that they were manufactured by Hanna, Donald & Wilson of Paisley. Acton swing bridge is a symmetrical bowstring girder swing bridge, which was built in situ between 1931 and 1933, on {{an island in the}} centre of the river. It was first swung across the channel on 10 August 1933. J. A. Saner was again the designer. Dutton locks are of a similar design and age to those at Saltersford, and the Pelton turbines were made by Northern Foundry Co. Ltd. of Oldham, who are described as turbine makers on the cast-iron covers. Dutton sluice, some [...] to the north-east of the lock, was built in the 1870s, in a similar Baroque style to Hunt's weir, but is larger, with eight arches each carrying a sluice gate. Where the weir stream rejoins the main channel, the towpath is carried over it on Horse Bridge, which was designed by J. A. Saner, the Navigation's engineer, in 1915, and erected in 1916.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{describes}} aspects {{within an}} experimental and theoretical programme aimed generally at improving the structural performance of laminated beams fabricated from Irish-grown Sitka spruce. Such timber is characterised by low density and small dimensions, {{is likely to}} distort when dried and tends to fail in tension due {{to the presence of}} knots. The well-established technique of <b>laminating</b> <b>timber</b> overcomes some of these disadvantages and the improvements are most marked with low quality donor material. It has been found that the addition of modest ratios of FRP composite reinforcement can suppress tension failure in beams. The study of failure modes, particularly in tension-reinforced beams, is the main focus of this paper. It establishes that the ultimate load capacity depends on the behavior of the timber in compression, resulting in much more consistent behavior as well as a considerable increase in flexural stiffness...|$|R

5|$|In the Roman Catholic Church, {{the most}} {{important}} steps towards an expressionist design were under taken by Gillespie, Kidd & Coia. This began with St Paul's Church in the new town of Glenrothes (1956–57). This was a wedge-shaped construction of white-painted common brick focused on a dramatic, jagged metal cross by the sculptor Benno Schotz. From about 1960, all Gillespie, Kidd & Coia's churches were designed in this Late Modernist style, as at St Bride's, East Kilbride (1963–64), which had a rectangular plan. From the mid-1960s, they adopted a centralised, non-rectangular plan, with seating ranged round the altar, reflecting liturgical change. Sacred Heart Church, Cumbernauld (1964), was rectangular, of load-bearing brick, dramatically lit through dark coloured windows. Our Lady of Good Counsel, Dennistoun (1965) had a splayed plan and slanted ceiling. St Benedict Drumchapel (1965–67) had a prow-like roof on curved, <b>laminated</b> <b>timbers.</b> These innovative designs inspired others to experiment, including J. McCarron's Our Lady of Sorrows, South Uist (1964–65). However, many of these designs proved too radical and were later demolished by the Catholic Church, citing structural or maintenance problems.|$|R

30|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{presence}} of knots in structural lumber {{is one of the most}} important strengthreducing factors. For practical purposes, visual grading including knot restriction is an effective method for nondestructive evaluation of strength. Edge knot restriction for not only visually graded lumbers but also mechanically graded lumbers is specified in the Japanese agricultural standards for glued laminated lumber. We conducted experimental studies on differences of tensile strength distributions between mechanically high-grade and low-grade Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi, carriere) lumbers daily used for manufacturing glued <b>laminated</b> <b>timbers</b> in Nagano, Japan. We then examined the additional visual grading of mechanically graded lumbers for nondestructive evaluation. We visually graded the prepared mechanically graded lumber by focusing on the knots' area ratio of grouped knots. We confirmed that the higher visual grade related to the stronger tensile strength, similar to our present knowledge; but the effects of knot restriction were reduced when the length of the lumber increased in view of nonparametric 5 th percentiles of tensile strength. The differences in the strength/elasticity ratio between mechanically high-grade and low-grade lumber were negligible. It was clear that the length effect on the ratio in visually graded high-grade lumber was smaller than that of visually graded low-grade lumber. It was thus concluded that knot restriction should have little effect on the tensile strength of mechanically graded lumber.|$|R
