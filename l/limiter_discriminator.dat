40|$|This {{research}} investigates robust demodulation of Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK) signals, using demodulator {{diversity and}} real-time bit-error-rate (BER) estimation. GMSK {{is particularly important}} because of its use in prominent wireless standards around the world (GSM, DECT, CDPD, DCS 1800, and PCS 1900). The dissertation begins with a literature review of GMSK demodulation techniques (coherent and noncoherent) and includes an overview of singlechannel interference rejection techniques in digital wireless communications. Various forms of GMSK demodulation are simulated, including the <b>limiter</b> <b>discriminator</b> and di#erential demodulator (i. e., twenty-five variations in all).

40|$|Abstract — This paper investigates {{an energy}} efficient, {{noncoherent}} system design for Bluetooth. We propose using a soft decision differential phase detector (SDDPD) {{along with the}} (15, 10) shortened Hamming channel (SHC) code. Unlike previous work, where SDDPD with ML detection gives hard estimates of the modulated bits, we develop a sequential, soft-in / soft-out (SISO) SDDPD which exchanges soft information with the channel decoder. The proposed soft decision based receiver gives significant improvements in energy efficiency and throughput over the benchmark Bluetooth receiver using <b>limiter</b> <b>discriminator</b> integrator (LDI) detection with hard decision channel decoding. It also outperforms SDDPD with ML detection followed by hard decision channel decoding. Additional gains are obtained by extending our proposed system to perform bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM). The effect of bit-interleaving {{on the performance of}} LDI detection and SDDPD with hard decision decoding is studied. The capacity of our system under BICM is evaluated and extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart analysis is used to analyze convergence behavior of the proposed receiver...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} the {{system with the}} Serially Concatenated Coded CPM (SCCCPM) and the nonlinear <b>limiter</b> phase <b>discriminator</b> receiver. We develop the FG framework allowing {{the use of the}} SPA factor node marginalization rules involving canonical distributions with finite number of parameters. We show that the straightforward application of the traditional constellation space approach is intractable. We also show that the sampled signal space does not allow an application of the parametrized canonical distributions for the variable nodes densities. The solutions we suggest in the paper stands on using the sampled parametric (phase) space of the CPM for all SPA processing. We use the idea of the component modulo mean approximation for the canonical signal phase distributions. The modulo operations are applied only on component mean values. This keeps the update rules simple by avoiding the circular distortion of the Gaussian component densities while still capturing the circular nature of the modulo operations on the signal phase.

40|$|We {{show that}} {{nonlinear}} directional couplers with variable coupling coefficients {{can be used}} to compose a special kind of switching matrix. The switching matrix can be controlled by the signal itself or by a strong pump. Light routing is realized by adjustment {{of the power of the}} signal or the pump. Because light routing is based on the optical Kerr effect, ultrafast routing is possible. © 2003 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: 190. 4360, 230. 1150, 130. 3120. The potential applications of nonlinear directional couplers (NLDCs) in all-optical signal processing have attracted a great deal of research interest since they were first introduced by Jensen in 1982. 1 Several variations of the NLDC, such as Y junctions, 2 X junctions, 3 and bent couplers, 4 – 6 have been proposed since then. Usually, these devices can be used as, e. g., optical switches, optical <b>limiters,</b> optical intensity <b>discriminators,</b> and logic gates.

This paper outlines the important characteristics being investigated. Measured data comparing the spectral occupancy and bit error probability (BEP) performance of PCM/FM {{with that of a}} prototype constant envelope Feher’s quadrature phase shift keying (FQPSK) modulator and demodulator will also be presented. Measured results in several radio frequency bands demonstrate that the 99. 99 % and - 60 dBc bandwidths of filtered FQPSK are only approximately one-half of the corresponding bandwidths of optimized PCM/FM even when the signal is non-linearly amplified.

40|$|Phase locked loops (PLL's) {{are well}} known as a {{threshold}} extension demodulator for analogue FM signals. This capability {{may lead to the}} low bit error rate demodulation for digital FM signals. A PLL has also its native frequency tracking ability and is suited to the demodulation of the signals having large Doppler shifts, for example signals from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. In this paper, we study the demodulation scheme of Continuous Phase FSK (CPFSK) and Gaussian filtered MSK (GMSK) signals using a Digital Signal Processing type Digital PLL (DSP DPLL). First we propose a DSP DPLL completely equivalent to an Analog PLL (APLL). Next we adopt the sequence estimation scheme to compensate the Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) associated with the finite loop bandwidth of the DSP DPLL. Through computer simulations it is clarified that the proposed DSP DPLL with sequence estimator can achieve better BER performance compared with the conventional <b>Limiter</b> <b>Discriminator</b> (LD) detection on the AWGN channel. We have also shown that the DSP DPLL with sequence estimator has excellent BER characteristics on Rician fading channels having actual large Doppler shifts...|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 25 - 28, 1993 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaMuch modem {{telemetry}} {{is transmitted}} {{in a digital}} format and to be compatible with existing range equipment the digital data is impressed on the carrier using FM modulation. The receiving system in common use employs an FM limiter/discriminator as a detector followed by an integrate and dump matched filter for bit detection. This system has been studied by previous authors [1] and {{it is well known}} that in the absence of frequency uncertainty the optimum transmission parameters consist of a modulation index of. 7 (peak-to-peak deviation divided by the bit rate) and an IF filter bandwidth equal to the bit rate followed by a <b>limiter</b> <b>discriminator.</b> In many cases, there is a need for some small amount of analog telemetry transmission in addition to the digital data discussed above. In these cases it is common practice to include analog subcarriers on the main carrier with the digital data modulating the carrier at baseband, the resulting system is called PCM/FM + FM/FM. These hybrid analog/digital systems are the subject of this paper. In particular this paper addresses the performance of these systems through simulation using the Block Oriented System Simulator (BOSS) from Comdisco and with analytical techniques to obtain the BER versus SNR curves for these systems. The simulation is used over a wide range of parameters to find the optimum values of modulation index and IF bandwidth for these systems...|$|E

[...] The analysis is first carried out for the detection of M-ary CPFSK with modulation index [...] [special characters omitted] [...] in wideband channels. The effect of symbol timing errors and baseband symbol pulse shaping is considered. It is shown that CD-DD detection has better performance and less sensitivity to timing errors than LD detection and DC detection whereas LD detection and DC detection yield approximately the same performance both in the presence {{and in the absence of}} symbol timing errors. [...] The bandlimiting effect of the front-end filter of the three receivers is then considered. An effective methodology is developed to take into account the effect of Intersymbol Interference (ISI). As in wideband channels, it is shown that even in bandlimited channels, CD-DD detection yields better performance and has less sensitivity to ISI than LD detection and DC detection whereas the latter two detection schemes have almost identical performance and sensitivities. [...] The performance evaluation of LD detection of M-ary CPFSK with arbitrary modulation index, in both wideband and bandlimited channels, is also considered in order to determine the optimum modulation index which minimizes the error probability. It is shown that {{the performance}} of LD detection can be improved by increasing the modulation index above [...] [special characters omitted] [...] . A variable delay differential detection technique which employs a delay interval dependent on the modulation index is analyzed for the detection of binary CPFSK signals with arbitrary modulation index in bandlimited channels.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the system {{performances}} of M-ary {{differential phase shift}} keying (DPSK) with <b>limiter</b> <b>discriminator</b> detector (LDD) and differential phase detector (DPD) are investigated. The average error probability for DPSK-LDD and DPSK-DPD is evaluated in the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and fading channels which include the satellite mobile channel (Rician) and the land mobile channel (Rayleigh). The systems analysed in this thesis are narrow-band systems which use Nyquist filters as the system filters. The time domain representation of the signal is derived for the system. Non-coherent detection methods; limiter discrimination detection and differential phase detection are analysed. In the DPSK-LDD system there is intersymbol interference (ISI) at the optimum sampling time. We can use the roll-off (3 of the Nyquist filter to reduce the effect of ISI by increasing the value of (3. Expressions for the error probability of DPSK-LDD and DPSK-DPD are derived. The average error probability for binary, quaternary and octal symbols is computed {{as a function of}} various parameters such as energy to noise ratio, time delay, Doppler frequency shift and roll-off (3 of the Nyquist filters. In the DPSK-LDD system the best sampling time has a shift of T/ 2 (T is the symbol duration) from the point at which DPSK-DPD samples are optimal. The error probability for DPSK-LDD fluctuates against time delay for small value of the time delay while for DPSK-DPD it increases with time delay. In the presence of Doppler frequency shift the DPSK-LDD system performs better than the DPSK-DPD system. In the absence of Doppler frequency shift the DPSK-DPD system gives a lower error probability than the DPSK-LDD system. The error probability for both DPSK-LDD and DPSK-DPD decreases with increasing K (the ratio of energy in specular and diffuse components), energy to noise ratio and (3 and the error probability increases with increasing Doppler frequency shift and the number of symbols...|$|E
