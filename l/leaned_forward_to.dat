5|$|This brought wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans to {{the crease}} and exposed the hosts' lower-order. The {{last of the}} {{specialist}} batsmen, Compton nearly departed soon after when he <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> a leg-side delivery from Johnson's off spin. He overbalanced and stumbled forwards, and Tallon removed the bails. There were no television replays to assist the umpires in those days, and although the attempted stumping appeared close to the naked eye, {{the benefit of the}} doubt was given to the batsman and the appeal rejected. Compton made use of this and attacked Toshack successfully, forcing Bradman to make a bowling change. In fading light, Compton combined with the gloveman to add 75 runs for the seventh wicket in 70 minutes, before Lindwall removed Evans—who attempted a wild slash—to leave England 216/7. Compton reached stumps on 64, accompanied by Alec Bedser, who was on four, as England ended the day at 231/7. Compton had been dropped one-handed on 50 by Tallon, before being missed on 64 by the wicket-keeper from the bowling of Johnston just before stumps.|$|E
5|$|Yardley won the toss {{and elected}} to bat. England {{consolidated}} their innings after falling to 2/28. The hosts were content to score slowly and regroup, and Johnson’s first ten overs before lunch yielded only seven runs. However, when Johnson was bowling his second spell after lunch, Jack Crapp hit three driven boundaries in quick succession. Crapp {{was eager to}} use his feet {{to get to the}} pitch of Johnson’s deliveries, and subsequently dealt with the spin fairly comfortably, whereas many of his compatriots stood in their crease and found matters much more difficult. Crapp's counter-attack prompted Bradman to take the second new ball and remove Johnson with the score at 2/96. England then lost three quick wickets to the pacemen to be 5/119. Soon after, Yardley lofted Ernie Toshackwho was bowling leg theoryinto the on-side and Johnson caught him for 22 at forward square leg to leave England at 6/141. Soon after, Compton, the last of the specialist batsmen, nearly departed when he <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> a leg-side delivery from Johnson. He overbalanced and stumbled forwards, and Tallon removed the bails. There were no television replays to assist the umpires in those days, and although the attempted stumping appeared close to the naked eye, {{the benefit of the doubt}} was given to the batsman and the appeal rejected.|$|E
2500|$|Following Gehrig's {{visit to}} the Mayo Clinic, he briefly rejoined the Yankees in Washington, D.C. As his train pulled into Union Station, he was greeted {{by a group of}} Boy Scouts, happily waving and wishing him luck. Gehrig waved back, but he <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> his companion, Rutherford [...] "Rud" [...] Rennie of the New York Herald Tribune, and said, [...] "They're wishing me luck—and I'm dying." ...|$|E

60|$|Once or twice, {{as nature}} dictates, CRICHTON <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> stir the pot, {{and the smell}} is borne westward. He then resumes his silent vigil.|$|R

6000|$|While he is {{speaking}} the door has been opened, and HARRIS has gone [...] swiftly to it, spoken to someone and returned. He <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> [...] the MAYOR.|$|R
60|$|This {{left the}} Englishman {{sitting at the}} table with the last gambler, whose back was turned toward Allie. She saw the Englishman <b>lean</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> speak. Then the gambler arose and, turning, came {{directly}} toward her.|$|R
50|$|If using a cable machine, {{the body}} <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> {{counterbalance}} the weight moved, with the feet braced and the elbows are positioned slightly below shoulder height. The arms move the same arc as a bench fly, {{relative to the}} torso.|$|R
60|$|Burt and Ezra <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> listen, {{while the}} old man sank his voice to a whisper.|$|E
60|$|Her {{words were}} so softly spoken {{that they seemed}} to melt away. She <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> look in his face.|$|E
60|$|The others {{leaped into}} the brush. Allen saw that affairs were turning against him. He <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> Jasper's neck.|$|E
60|$|Ida {{started at}} this, and <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> eagerly <b>to</b> catch Weston's answer.|$|R

6000|$|Miss Ramsey: [...] "No, no! The window! A little faint--it's so close-- There, it's {{all right}} now. Or it will be--when--I've had--another cigarette." [...] She <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> take one; Ashley gravely watches her, but says nothing. She lights her cigarette, but, without smoking, throws it away. [...] "Go on." ...|$|R
60|$|And Rose let all {{her flowers}} stray {{down into the}} bottom of the boat, as she clasped her hands and <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> listen.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was plain}} Rupert had said nothing of having seen me, or of our {{interview}} in the street. He seemed a little ashamed, and <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> say-- ...|$|E

50|$|In this {{variation}} of a cloverleaf instead of turning around when turning the opponent over, the wrestler faces {{the same direction}} as the opponent <b>to</b> squat and <b>lean</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> apply more pressure to the legs, spine, and abdomen.

6000|$|... "Dead!" [...] whispered Lane, and he <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> {{cover his}} face with his hands. He had seemed so numb to feeling. But now a storm shook him.|$|E
60|$|The châtelain was so {{entranced by}} her gentle and sweet manner that he <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> listen, lest a {{syllable}} {{of what she}} whispered might escape his ears.|$|E

60|$|The trees grew blurred together; he had <b>to</b> <b>lean</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> {{evade the}} {{thrashing}} branches. His horse was blundering horribly, the slope grew steeper still, {{the ground beneath}} the dusty snow and fallen leaves was granite hard; but he was scarcely a length away, a few paces more would bring him level, and his right hand was stretched out for a grip of the stranger's bridle.|$|R
60|$|He <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> and beckoned <b>to</b> Gaston to draw {{his chair}} nearer.|$|R
60|$|A dull flush burned {{upon his}} cheeks. He took his {{seat at the}} table, but <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> address her. A note of belligerency had crept into his tone.|$|E

50|$|Although the {{paintings}} are noticeably different (the subjects are clothed differently and on different chairs) the Madonna {{is more or}} less in the same position in both works. This parallelism is designed to make viewers have the same attitude as the magus when looking at the Madonna and Child. They are imagined to be kneeling in front of Mary, and could easily <b>lean</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> kiss the foot of Jesus.|$|R
50|$|Another dashboard-mounted {{item was}} the traffic-light viewer, a ribbed plastic visor that was {{installed}} {{just above the}} speedometer. Because the roof extends so far forward of the driver, {{it is hard to}} see overhead traffic lights. The traffic light viewer captured the reflection of overhead traffic lights so that the driver didn't have <b>to</b> <b>lean</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> see past the edge of the roof. A/C was also an option.|$|R
60|$|The {{auctioneer}} <b>leaned</b> <b>forward,</b> expecting <b>to</b> see {{a familiar}} face. He saw instead a very distinguished-looking and remarkably well-turned-out stranger, smiling pleasantly {{at him from}} the front row of the audience.|$|R
