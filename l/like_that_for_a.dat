40|$|Mixtures of {{nonionic}} and anionic surfactants, including Corexit 9527, {{were tested}} {{to determine their}} effects on bacterial oxidation of acetate and alkanes in crude oil by cells pregrown on these substrates. Corexit 9527 inhibited oxidation of the alkanes in crude oil by Acinetobacter calcoaceticus ATCC 31012, while Span 80, a Corexit 9527 constituent, markedly increased the oil oxidation rate. Another Corexit 9527 constituent, the negatively charged dioctyl sulfosuccinate (AOT), strongly reduced the oxidation rate. The combination of Span 80 and AOT increased the rate, {{but not as much}} as Span 80 alone increased it, which tentatively explained the negative effect of Corexit 9527. The results of acetate uptake and oxidation experiments indicated that the nonionic surfactants interacted with the acetate uptake system while the anionic surfactant interacted with the oxidation system of the bacteria. The overall effect of Corexit 9527 on alkane oxidation by A. calcoaceticus ATCC 31012 thus seems to be the sum of the independent effects of the individual surfactants in the surfactant mixture. When Rhodococcus sp. strain 094 was used, the alkane oxidation rate decreased to almost zero in the presence of a mixture of Tergitol 15 -S- 7 and AOT even though the Tergitol 15 -S- 7 surfactant increased the alkane oxidation rate and AOT did not affect it.

Blood samples were drawn 5 min before and: 3, 9, 15, 30, and 70 min after completion of drinking. Ingestion induced no significant change in plasma Na(+), K(+), osmotic, or protein concentrations, blood pressure; or heart rate. Plasma volume (PV) was increases (P < 0. 05) between 30 - 70 min with isotonic saline and the two commercial drinks. Ingestion induced a decrease in plasma AVP (PAVP) at 3 min, which was maximal (P < 0. 05) at 15 min with all drinks. Thus, the act of drinking, independent of the composition or osmolality of the fluid absorbed, leads to a prompt inhibition of PAVP secretion in man. With the exception of rehydration with isotonic saline, this prompt response was followed by a long lasting inhibition of PAVP. There was no change in PRA, plasma aldosterone, atrial natriuretic peptide, or epinephrine, but an increase in plasma norepinephrine occurred immediately after ingestion, which suggests, <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> PAVP depression, <b>a</b> drinking-stimulate neural mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Dielectric {{polymer film}} {{capacitors}} with {{high energy density}}, low loss, and fast discharge speed are highly desirable for compact and reliable electrical power systems. However, achieving both high energy density and low loss as well as fast discharge speed is difficult. Even though PVDF-based ferroelectric homopolymer and copolymers receive much attention due to the high dielectric constant and breakdown strength, the challenge for their application in electric energy storage lies in reducing the conduction and ferroelectric loss. The key is to understand the fundamental dipole reorientation and switching mechanisms {{in response to an}} oscillating electric field and in turn their effects on energy storage behavior. In this work, the compensation polarization in ferroelectric polymers was reduced by confining ferroelectric domains can facilitate a fast dipole reorientation during discharge and in turn the ferroelectric loss will be reduced and the discharged energy density will increase. ^ Based on the fundamental understanding, confined ferroelectric properties were achieved by confining the PVDF lamellar crystals with a low polarizability polystyrene (PS) interphase layer to reduce the compensation polarization in PVDF copolymers. Moreover, the confinement effect of different PS contents on ferroelectric and dielectric properties was investigated in a family of the P(VDF-CTFE) -g-PS graft copolymers with different PS grafting length. At low degree of confinement (i. e. low PS wt%), the antiferroelectric-like behavior was observed at an electric field as high as 400 MV/m as well as extremely low remnant polarization and low ferroelectric loss. At high degree of confinement (i. e. high PS wt%), the confined ferroelectric behavior had narrow hysteresis loops and became more <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> linear dielectrics. <b>As</b> a result, both dielectric and ferroelectric losses were significantly reduced at the expense of a moderate decrease in the discharged energy density. The best performance for high energy density and low loss dielectric capacitor applications was achieved in the P(VDF-CTFE) -g-PS with ∼ 34 wt. % PS, a relatively high discharged Ue of ∼ 10 J/cm 3 at 600 MV/m (extrapolated from 550 MV/m), a fairly low dielectric loss (tanδ = 0. 006 at 1 kHz), and a low ferroelectric/conduction loss (undischarged% = 17. 6 % at 550 MV/m). ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] The {{admission}} to hospital of three construction workers with acute respiratory distress caused by inhalation of chlorine gas prompted the inspection of a building site located in a kraft pulpmill. The accidental emissions {{had taken place in}} the bleach plant and the construction workers assigned there were surveyed to uncover possible large scale health effects. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS [...] A questionnaire was presented to 281 workers (participation rate = 97 %); 257 workers reported an average of 24 exposure episodes to chlorine and derivatives over a three to six month period. The air monitoring data available from the pulpmill's industrial hygienist were not useful in linking specific events reported by the workers to environmental conditions in the bleach plant. RESULTS [...] Over 60 % of the workers described a characteristic flu <b>like</b> syndrome <b>that</b> lasted <b>for</b> <b>an</b> average of 11 days and was exacerbated by new bouts of exposure. Irritation of the throat (78 %) and eyes (77 %), cough (67 %), and headache (63 %) were the most often reported symptoms. Shortness of breath was reported by 54 % of the participants and was not associated with age, smoking state, or history of asthma or chronic bronchitis. First aid self referral was associated with significantly greater reporting of most symptoms, including dyspnoea and cough. A significantly greater proportion of workers in the dyspnoea group had gone at least once for first aid care after a gassing incident (64 % as opposed to 48 %, p = 0. 008). Throat irritation and cough persisted for mean intervals of eight and 11 days respectively. A flu like syndrome lasted <b>for</b> <b>an</b> average of 20 days. Seventy one subjects were considered to be a moderate to high risk of having persisting respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSION [...] Throat and eye irritation as well as cough and flu like symptoms are frequent occurrences after repeated accidental inhalation of chlorine.

40|$|Large Eddy Simulation (LES) has {{potential}} to address unsteady phenomena in turbulent premixed flames and to capture turbulence scales and {{their influence on}} combustion. Thus, this approach is gaining interest in industry to analyse turbulent reacting flows. In LES, the dynamics of large-scale turbulent eddies down to a cut-off scale are solved, with models to mimic the influences of sub-grid scales. Since the flame front is thinner than the smallest scale resolved in a typical LES, the premixed combustion is a sub-grid scale (SGS) phenomenon and involves strong interplay among small-scale turbulence, chemical reactions and molecular diffusion. Sub-grid scale combustion models must accurately represent these processes. When the flame front is thinner than the smallest turbulent scale, the flame is corrugated by the turbulence and {{can be seen as}} an ensemble of thin, one-dimensional laminar flames (flamelets). This allows one to decouple turbulence from chemistry, with a significant reduction in computational effort. However, potentials and limitations of flamelets are not fully explored and understood. This work contributes to this understanding. Two models are identified, one based on <b>an</b> algebraic expression <b>for</b> the reaction rate of a progress variable and the assumption of fast chemistry, the other based on a database of unstrained flamelets in which reaction rates are stored and parametrised using a progress variable and its SGS variance, and their potentials are shown <b>for</b> <b>a</b> wide range of premixed combustion conditions of practical interest. The sensitivity to a number of model parameters and boundary conditions is explored to assess the robustness of these models. This work shows that the SGS variance of progress variable plays {{a crucial role in the}} SGS reaction rate modelling and cannot be obtained using a simple algebraic closure <b>like</b> <b>that</b> commonly used <b>for</b> <b>a</b> passive scalar. The use of strained flamelets to include the flame stretching effects is not required when the variance is obtained from its transport equation and the resolved turbulence contains predominant part of the turbulent kinetic energy. Thus, it seems that SGS closure using unstrained flamelets model is robust and adequate for wide range of turbulent premixed combustion conditions.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{motivated}} by the understanding that entrepreneurship varies from one context to another as there are distinctive factors that influence the development and organization of entrepreneurial activities in any particular national context. Using qualitative methodology the study aims at developing a conceptual and empirical framework for the study {{and understanding of the}} phenomenon of entrepreneurship as an organizing and social process. From institutional and social networking perspective, the study describes and analyses how the societally embedded socio-cultural values and beliefs impact on the development and organizing of entrepreneurial activities within the broader historical, economic and institutional context of Ghana. While re-reading and thereby challenging some of the mainstream arguments underlying the conventional wisdom of entrepreneurship that Iay emphasis on psychological attributes of the entrepreneur, the study argues that the nature and quality of the environment in which the entrepreneurial process is initiated and organized becomes very crucial to the successful development and survival of any entrepreneurial activities. The empirical findings lend a strong illustrative support to the proposition that the development and organizing of entrepreneurial activities in any national context is an interplay between the individual characteristics {{and the nature of the}} organizing context. <b>For</b> example, in <b>a</b> developing country, Iike Ghana, colonialism and political instability, mismanagement of the economic, paucity of the macro-infrastructures an misguided and inconsistent government policy directives have contributed to the non-development of effective indigenous entrepreneurial activities. And in a society with strong family orientation, social networks (connections) - patron-client relationship and reciprocity as <b>a</b> mechanism <b>for</b> collective survival are used essentially as <b>a</b> countervailing mechanism <b>for</b> circumventing any institutional inadequacies. Thus, the study proposes the integration of both pychoanalytical and contextual perspectives in the study and development of entrepreneurial activities. Finally, the study not only calls for the "retuning" of the dysfunctional aspects of the environment with regards to the mainstream socio-cultural values, basic institutions and the various administrative setups that still bear the hallmarks of the colonial structures but also argues for the "re-embeddednes" of the mainstream concepts of entrepreneurship into the specificity of the socio-economic and cultural context of an emerging economy <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of Ghana <b>for</b> <b>an</b> effective development and promotion of entrepreneurial activities...|$|R

We have run high-resolution N-body simulations of dwarf galaxies orbiting within the Milky Way halo to determine if such observations can be explained with dark matter potentials like those implied by current structure formation models. We show that tidal forces acting on dwarfs with constant density cores or with cuspy profiles having a low concentration parameter c≲ 7) lead to flat outer stellar density profiles <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of Carina <b>for</b> <b>a</b> variety of orbital configurations. On the contrary, {{it is more difficult}} to remove stars from cuspy dark matter haloes with concentrations as high as predicted by cold dark matter (CDM) models at the mass scale of dwarf galaxies (c > 10), and the data can only be reproduced assuming nearly radial orbits. Our simulations show that Carina is losing mass at a fractional rate < 0. 1 Gyr− 1 and its mass-to-light ratio could be inflated by at most a factor of 2 due to unbound stars projected along the line of sight. We follow the evolution of the tidal debris within a triaxial clumpy cold dark matter Milky Way halo which causes differential precession and small-scale heating of the stellar streams. This renders them useless as a dynamical tracer of the Galactic potential in CDM cosmogonies. Models with warm dark matter (WDM) or collisional fluid dark matter (FDM) produce dwarf haloes with lower central densities than CDM and would be consistent with the observed tidal tails even for orbits with eccentricities as low as indicated by current data on nearby dwarf spheroidals. Galactic haloes in models with FDM are expected to be smooth and spherical and would be favoured by the detection of cold coherent streams such as that associated with the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal.
