This <b>lectin</b> is toxic to some insects. Rats were fed raw and cooked genetically modified potatoes, using unmodified Desiree Red potatoes as controls. One control group ate an unmodified Desiree Red potato spiked with the GNA snowdrop <b>lectin.</b> Twelve feeding experiments were conducted, ten short-term (10 days) and two long-term (110 days). Before the experiment Pusztai and his team said they expected no differences between the rats fed modified potatoes and rats fed the non-modified ones.|$|E
5|$|The {{mushroom}} {{also contains}} a sugar-binding protein, or <b>lectin,</b> that has affinity for the sugars xylose and melibiose. The <b>lectin</b> is mitogenic—that is, it can stimulate cells {{to begin the process}} of cell division, resulting in mitosis. Further, the <b>lectin</b> has antiviral properties: it inhibits the human immunodeficiency virus enzyme reverse transcriptase. Other studies suggest that B.edulis also has antiviral activity against Vaccinia virus and tobacco mosaic virus grown in culture. Antiviral compounds from mushrooms are a subject of interest in biomedical research for their potential to advance the knowledge of viral replication, and as new drugs in the treatment of viral disease.|$|E

In 1995 the Scottish Agriculture Environment and Fisheries Department commissioned a £1.6 million three-year research study to assess the safety of genetically engineered Desiree Red potatoes. The potatoes had been developed by biochemist John Gatehouse at Cambridge Agricultural Genetics (later renamed Axis Genetics) and had recently completed two years of field trials at Rothamsted Experimental Station. The GNA gene from the Galanthus (snowdrop) plant was inserted into the potato, allowing the GNA <b>lectin</b> protein to be synthesised.

The yields of animal <b>lectins</b> are usually low compared with the yields of plant <b>lectins</b> such as legume <b>lectins.</b> <b>Lectins</b> manifest a diversity of activities including antitumor, immunomo dulatory, antifungal, HIV- 1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory, and anti-insect activities, which may find practical applications.

40|$|Abstract. The <b>lectins</b> {{from the}} seeds of Dolichos lablab var. lignosus (field bean) and Dolichos lablab var. typicus (lablab bean) have been {{isolated}} in a homogeneous form by affinity chromatography on D-mannose linked Sepharose. Both the <b>lectins</b> are glycoproteins and have a molecular weight of 60, 000 and S 20,w value of 5 · 2 and seem to {{be made up of}} 4 similar subunits (apparent molecular weight 15, 000). The carbohydrate content ofthe <b>lectins</b> is mostly fucose (2 - 5 mol per mol of protein), mannose (5 - 8 mol per mol of protein) and N-acetyl glucosamine (1 – 2 mol per mol of protein). The amino acid composition of both the <b>lectins</b> was similar and methionine and half cystine could not be detected, Both the <b>lectins</b> have similar tryptic peptide map. Alanine and serine were the only Ν and C-terminal amino acids for both <b>lectins.</b> The <b>lectins</b> were found to contain low amounts of bound metals such as manganese, magnesium and calcium. The near ultra-violet circular dichroism spectra of the <b>lectins</b> are similar to that of Sainfoin. Circular dichroism data indicate that tyrosine and tryptophan residues are involved in sugar binding. The <b>lectins</b> are nonspecific for human blood groups and they agglutinate a variety of other erythrocytes. Among a number of sugars, D-glucose and D-mannose inhibited the haemag-glutinating activity of the <b>lectins.</b> The <b>lectins</b> were antigenically similar...|$|R

40|$|Two <b>lectins</b> {{from the}} rice bran of Amon variety were {{purified}} by successive chromatography of 100 % ammonium sulfate saturated crude extract on Sephadex G- 50 followed by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose.

40|$|<b>Lectins</b> are {{generally}} associated with plant or animal components, selectively bind carbohydrates, {{and interact with}} procaryotic and eucaryotic cells. <b>Lectins</b> have various specificities {{that are associated with}} their ability to interact with acetylaminocarbohydrates, aminocarbohydrates, sialic acids, hexoses, pentoses, and as other carbohydrates. Microbial surfaces generally contain many of the sugar residues that react with <b>lectins.</b> <b>Lectins</b> are presently used in the clinical laboratory to type blood cells and are used in a wide spectrum of applications, including, in part, as carriers of chemotherapeutic agents, as mitogens, for fractionation of animal cells, and for investigations of cellular surfaces.

40|$|<b>Lectins</b> are a {{group of}} {{proteins}} with carbohydrate recognition activity. <b>Lectins</b> are categorized into many families based on their different cellular locations {{as well as their}} specificities for a variety of carbohydrate structures due to the features of their carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) modules. Many studies have indicated that the direct recognition of particular oligosaccharides on viral components by <b>lectins</b> is important for interactions between hosts and viruses. Herein, we aim to globally review the roles of this recognition by animal <b>lectins</b> in antiviral immune responses and viral pathogenesis. The different classes of mammalian <b>lectins</b> can either recognize carbohydrates to activate host immunity for viral elimination or can exploit those carbohydrates as susceptibility factors to facilitate viral entry, replication or assembly. Additionally, some arthropod C-type <b>lectins</b> were recently identified as key susceptibility factors that directly interact with multiple viruses and then facilitate infection. Summarization of the pleiotropic roles of direct viral recognition by animal <b>lectins</b> will benefit our understanding of host-virus interactions and could provide insight into the role of <b>lectins</b> in antiviral drug and vaccine development...|$|R

5|$|Confusion reigned {{over just}} what {{experiments}} had been conducted. Pusztai had mentioned {{two lines of}} genetically modified potatoes, meaning the two GNA lines, and this was reported by the media. The Rowett institute mistakenly assumed the media {{was talking about a}} second line transformed with concanavalin A (ConA), a Jack Bean <b>lectin</b> that is toxic to mammals. Transgenic ConA Potatoes had been developed, but had never been tested. Two press releases issued by the Rowett Institute on the 10th and 11th praised Pusztai's research and supported increased safety tests on genetically modified food. The press releases also said that the potatoes were modified with ConA, adding to the confusion. Pusztai claimed that he had not seen the press releases before they went out and had no opportunity to correct the mistake. James says that he drafted it and Pusztai rewrote one section, but did not see the final copy. The mistaken belief that the ConA gene was inserted into the potato led scientist Sir Robert May and Agricultural Minister Jack Cunningham to release statements to the media saying that the findings were not surprising, as a known poison had been added to the potato. Some scientists still dismiss Pusztai's work over this error.|$|E
