50|$|Waterfowl {{hunting with}} lead shot, {{along with the}} use of lead sinkers in angling, has been {{identified}} as a major cause of lead poisoning in waterfowl, which often feed off the bottom of lakes and wetlands where lead shot collects. In the United States, UK, Canada, and many western European countries (France as of 2006), all shot used for waterfowl must now be non-toxic, and therefore may not contain any <b>lead.</b> <b>Steel</b> is the cheapest alternative to lead. However, some hunters do not like its shooting properties, as steel is significantly less dense than lead. Therefore, its effective range is decreased due to rapidly decreasing velocity of the shot: thirty to forty yards is considered its maximum effective range for duck hunting. Many companies have improved steel shot by increasing muzzle-velocity, by using fast burning powder such as rifle powder thus making more consistent 'shot' or pellet patterns. Steel shot now travels at 1400 to 1500 feet per second. However, any use of steel shot requires a shotgun barrel with thicker walls and a specially-hardened bore, resulting in a heavier gun.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Due to the {{ubiquitous}} nature of ionizing radiation, in vivo measurement sys-tems {{designed to measure}} low levels of radio-nuclides in people are usually enclosed within a high-density shield. <b>Lead,</b> <b>steel,</b> earth, and water {{are just some of}} the materials that have been and are being used to shield the detectors from radiations of cosmic, atmospheric, man-made, and terrestrial origin. At many Depart-ment of Energy sites, the counting room shields are constructed of pre-World War II steel to reduce the background levels in order to perform measurements that have low minimum detect-able activities. The pre-World War II steel is commonly called low background steel in the in vivo industry vernacular. The low background descriptor comes from the fact the steel was manufactured prior to the beginning of atmo-spheric testing of nuclear weapons in the 1940 ’s. Consequently, the steel is not likely to be contaminated with fission or activation products from fallout. For high energy photons (600 keV E 1500 keV), 30 cm of steel shielding significantly reduces the measured background radiation levels. This is the story of the unique steel that began as the hull of the U. S. S. Indiana and now forms a shielded roo...|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} Positron Emission Tomography (PET) centers {{has been growing}} rapidly. Many of the new {{facilities}} have been retrofitted into existing imaging centers and hospitals. Space in the facilities is often cramped, resulting in the hot lab, patient quiet rooms, and the scanners frequently being placed {{in close proximity to}} uncontrolled areas where non-occupational dose limits apply. Of particular concern are ceilings when occupied areas are above the PET clinics. Ceiling shielding is generally constructed of layers of suspended <b>lead,</b> <b>steel,</b> and the existing concrete floor of the deck above. The attenuation provided the layered shield is difficult to calculate by point kernel techniques, yet the cost of overshielding can be high when lead must be suspended from the floor above. In this work we evaluate ceiling shielding for a proposed PET center using different methods. A Monte Carlo calculation using MCNP modeled the patient with a sitting MIRD 18 anthropomorphic model in which 15 mCi of FDG is distributed equally among the brain and bladder. A point kernel calculation was made using Mercurad, a code designed to manage attenuation in layered shields. The results from the two models are compared {{to each other and to}} measurements conducted on the finished PET clinic. Key Words: Shielding, Monte Carlo, point kernel...|$|E
40|$|The DOE National Center of Excellence for Metals Recycle (NMR) {{proposes to}} define and {{implement}} a complex-wide directed reuse strategy for surplus radiologically impacted lead (Pb) and steel {{as part of the}} U. S. Department of Energy's commitment to the safe and cost-effective recycle or reuse of excess materials and equipment across the DOE complex. NMR will, under this proposal, act on behalf of the DOE Office of Environmental Management, Office of Technical Program Integration (specifically EM- 22), as the Department's clearinghouse for DOE surplus <b>lead,</b> <b>steel</b> and products created from these materials by developing and maintaining a cost-effective commercially-based contaminated lead and steel recycle program. It is NMR's intention, through this directed reuse strategy, to mitigate the adverse environmental and economic consequences of managing surplus lead and steel as a waste within the complex. This approach promotes the safe and cost-effective reuse of scrap metals in support of the Department's goals of resource utilization, energy conservation, pollution prevention and waste minimization. This report discusses recommendations for supplemental radiological release limits for the directed reuse of contaminated lead and steel by the DOE within the nuclear industry. The limits were originally selected from the American National Standards Institute and Health Physics Society standard N 13. 12 titled ''Surface and Volume Radioactivity Standards for Clearance'' (Health Physics Society, 1999) but were subsequently modified as a result of application-specific issues. Both the health and measurement implications from the adoption and use of the limits for directed reuse scenarios are discussed within this report...|$|E

40|$|Degradation {{of metals}} through {{atmospheric}} corrosion {{is a most}} important and costly phenomenon with significant effects on, e. g., the lifespan of industrial materials, the reliability of electronic components and military equipment, and the aesthetic appearance of our cultural heritage. Atmospheric corrosion {{is the result of}} the interaction between the metal and its atmospheric environment, and occurs in the presence of a thin aqueous adlayer. The common incorporation of pollutant species into this adlayer usually enhances the degradation process. During atmospheric corrosion indoors, low concentrations of organic atmospheric constituents, such as formic, acetic, propionic, butyric and oxalic acids, have found to play an accelerating role on a broad range of metals or their alloys, including <b>lead,</b> <b>steel,</b> nickel, copper, cadmium, magnesium and zinc. In this doctoral thesis the initial stages of the atmospheric corrosion of copper exposed to synthetic air, aiming at simulating representative indoor atmospheric environments, have been investigated both experimentally and through a computational method. The experiments have been based on a unique analytical setup in which a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) was integrated with infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS). This enabled the initial atmospheric corrosion of copper to be analyzed during ongoing corrosion in humidified air at room temperature and additions of 120 ppb (parts per volume billions) of acetic, formic or propionic acid. The main phases identified were copper (I) oxide (Cu 2 O) and various forms of copper carboxylate, and their amounts deduced with the different analytical techniques agree with a relative accuracy of 12 % or better. Particular emphasis has been on the identification of different forms of copper (I) oxide generated during these exposures. An electrochemically based model has been proposed to describe how copper oxides, formed in the presence of acetic acid, are electrochemically reduced in neutral solution. The model includes the electrochemical reduction of copper (II) oxide (CuO), amorphous copper (I) oxide (Cu 2 O) am, intermediate copper (I) oxide (Cu 2 O) in, and crystalline copper (I) oxide (Cu 2 O) cr. A good agreement is obtained between the model and experimental data, which supports the idea of a reduction sequence which starts with copper (II) oxide and continues with the reduction of the three copper (I) oxides at more negative potentials. The quantified analytical data obtained in this doctoral study on corrosion products formed on copper, and corresponding data on zinc reported elsewhere, were used as the starting point to develop a computational model, GILDES, that describes the atmospheric corrosion processes involved. GILDES considers the whole interfacial regime in which all known chemical reactions have been considered which are assumed to govern the initial atmospheric corrosion of copper or zinc in the presence of carboxylic acids. The model includes two separate pathways, a proton-induced dissolution of cuprous ions or zinc ions followed by the formation of either copper (I) oxide or zinc (II) oxide, and a carboxylate-induced dissolution followed by the formation of either copper (II) carboxylate or zinc (II) carboxylate. The model succeeds to predict the two main phases in the corrosion products and a correct ranking of aggressiveness of the three acids for both copper and zinc. The ranking has been attributed to differences in acid dissociation constant and deposition velocity of the carboxylic acids investigated. QC 2011111...|$|E
40|$|The University of Missouri (MU) Institute for Nano and Molecular Medicine, the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) and the University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR) have {{undertaken}} a new collaborative research initiative {{to further the}} development of improved boron delivery agents for BNCT. The first step of this effort has involved the design and {{construction of a new}} thermal neutron beam irradiation facility for cell and small-animal radiobological research at the MURR. In this paper we present the beamline design with the results of pertinent neutronic design calculations. Results of neutronic performance measurements, initiated in February 2008, will also be available for inclusion in the final paper. The new beam will be located in an existing 152. 4 mm (6 ’) diameter MURR beam tube extending from the core to the right in Figure 1. The neutron beam that emanates from the berylium reflector around the reactor is filtered with single-crystal silicon and single-crystal bismuth segments to remove high energy, fission spectrum neutrons and reactor gamma ray contamination. The irradiation chamber is downstream of the bismuth filter section, and approximately 3. 95 m from the central axis of the reactor. There is sufficient neutron flux available from the MURR at its rated power of 10 MW to avoid the need for cryogenic cooling of the crystals. The MURR operates on average 150 hours per week, 52 weeks a year. In order to take advantage of 7800 hours of operation time per year the small animal BNCT facility will incorparate a shutter constucuted of boral, <b>lead,</b> <b>steel</b> and polyethylene that will allow experimenters to access the irradiation chamber a few minutes after irradiation. Independent deterministic and stochastic models of the coupled reactor core and beamline were developed using the DORT two-dimensional radiation transport code and the MCNP- 5 Monte Carlo code, respectively. The BUGLE- 80 47 -neutron, 20 -gamma group cross section library was employed for the DORT computations, in keeping with previous practice for analysis of a number of other NCT neutron facilities worldwide. The standard ENDF/B Version 6. 8 cross section libraries were used with MCNP, except that special calculated cross section sets for the single-crystal bismuth and silicon filters in the MCNP calculations were provided to MU and INL specifically for this study by the Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute and, independently, by North Carolina State University. Cross sections for the amorphous bismuth and silicon files on the BUGLE- 80 library used with DORT were modified to account for the single-crystal form of these materials using correction factors computed using MCNP. A number of parameter studies were conducted, independently varying the thicknesses of the silicon and bismuth filter sections to find an optimum that maximizes the thermal neutron flux while maintaining the fast-neutron and gamma components of the beam within acceptable ranges. Both the DORT and MCNP beamline optimization computations led {{to the conclusion that the}} silicon filtering section should be approximately 55 cm in thickness and the bismuth section should be 8 cm in thickness. The total estimated thermal neutron flux delivered to the irradiation location by the filtered beam, integrated to 0. 414 eV, is approximately 9. 0 x 108 neutrons/cm 2 -s. The calculations also yielded an epithermal and fast-neutron kerma of approximately 1. 0 x 10 - 11 cGy-cm 2...|$|E
