Their spread {{consisted}} of elaborate dishes like kebabs, kormas, biryani, kaliya, nahari-kulchas, zarda, sheermal, roomali rotis, and warqi parathas. The richness of Awadh cuisine <b>lies</b> <b>not</b> only in the variety of cuisine but also in the ingredients used like mutton, paneer, and rich spices including cardamom and saffron.|$|E

25|$|Although Aimée {{accepted}} Islam {{as part of}} the harem etiquette, as well as {{the religion}} of her husband, she always remained a Roman Catholic in her heart. Her last wish was for a priest to perform the last rites. Her son did not deny her this: as Aimée lay dying, a priest passed for the first time through the Seraglio, to perform the Holy Sacrament before her death.

25|$|The bawarchis (chefs) and rakabdars (gourmet cooks) of Awadh {{invented the}} dum style of cooking or {{the art of}} cooking over a slow fire, which has become synonymous with Lucknow today.

25|$|With {{regard to}} morality, Kant {{argued that the}} source of the good <b>lies</b> <b>not</b> in {{anything}} outside the human subject, either in nature or given by God, but rather is only the good will itself. A good will is one that acts from duty in accordance with the universal moral law that the autonomous human being freely gives itself. This law obliges one to treat humanityunderstood as rational agency, and represented through oneself as well as othersas an end in itself rather than (merely) as means to other ends the individual might hold. This necessitates practical self-reflection in which we universalize our reasons.|$|E

25|$|Leo and Chen {{also suggest}} that the two tests are similar in most respects, with only a narrow gap between them, and would produce the same result in most cases. They caution that judges, rather than {{concerning}} themselves with the labels given to the tests for bias, should be wary of taking extraneous matters into consideration, no matter which test is applied. The case of Locabail (UK) Ltd. v. Bayfield Properties Ltd. (1999) identified two particular issues for judges to be mindful of– special knowledge and legal sophistication. The authors concluded their analysis by suggesting that the true importance of the matter <b>lies</b> <b>not</b> in which test is used, but in ensuring that judges have taken into account all relevant circumstances and excluded extraneous considerations which {{would not have been}} applicable to the general public.|$|E
25|$|In {{the example}} of salat, since salat is {{commanded}} in the Qur'an, all Muslims agree that salat is an obligatory part of Islamic religious practice. According to hadithists, {{the details of how}} to correctly perform salat, to validly fulfill the Qur'anic commmand of salat, can only be found in the ahadith. Despite this, salat is performed differently by different hadithist Islamic sects, depending on which hadith collection each sect relies upon. Quranists, for their part, leave the detail of salat to be a matter between each individual Muslim and Allah, with salat performance done to each Muslim's own individual understanding, interpretation and need. In the Quranists' view, correctly performed salat <b>lies</b> <b>not</b> in any supposed correct details of the prayers' performance, but on a correct intention to perform the prayers, valid however it may be individually performed.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of A's beliefs is no different. If A honestly believes that B {{is only slightly}} injured and so could move himself out of danger without difficulty, how fair is {{it to say that}} he ought to have foreseen? The test is what the reasonable person would have known and foreseen, given what A had done. It is the function of any court to evaluate behaviour. A defendant cannot evade responsibility through a form of wilful blindness. Fault <b>lies</b> <b>not</b> only in what a person actually believes, but also in failing to understand what the vast majority of other people would have understood. Hence, the test is hybrid, looking both at what the defendant actually knew and foresaw (i.e. subjective), and at what the reasonable person would have known (i.e. objective) and then combining the conclusions into a general evaluation of the degree of fault or blameworthiness.|$|E

25|$|In the 1830s {{the village}} {{consisted}} of only four houses: the hotel or inn, the smithy, and two toll houses. In 1845 the New Statistical Account records six other houses where spiritous liquors were sold. The road up from Uplawmoor {{was called the}} Lochlibo Road on the 1860s OS. The Lugton Inn was sadly destroyed by fire in the early 2000s. The name 'Lugton' is not marked on Timothy Pont's map of 1604. Some of the Lugton area farms are indicated, with Waterlands, Duniflett, Biggart, Roshead (Ramshead), and Knokmend (Knockmade). A Waterland Mill is shown. Armstrong's map of 1775, does not show Lugton or its farms and the only road passes Lochlibo from Glasgow and heads up through the Caldwell estate to Paisley. Thomson's 1820 map marks a 'Keepers Cottage' {{which may have been}} on the main entrance drive running to the main road. The Paraffin Lamp Inn is not marked on the 1860 OS, however it is present on the 1895 edition. It appears to have been called the 'Paraffin Lamp' for many years, prior to which it was a private dwelling with outbuildings. It had a piggery and smokehouse and when it became an inn the dwelling house continued its use as a private home. The old site of Halket Loch <b>lies</b> <b>not</b> far away, once located near the various Halket Farms and that of Lochridgehills Farm.|$|E

500|$|The ONA's main {{influence}} <b>lies</b> <b>not</b> {{with the}} group itself, but with its prolific release of written material. According to Senholt, [...] "the ONA has produced more material on both the practical and theoretical aspects of magic, {{as well as more}} ideological texts on Satanism and the Left-Hand Path in general, than larger groups such as the Church of Satan and the Temple of Set has produced in combination [...] makes the ONA an important player in the theoretical discussion of what the Left-Hand Path and Satanism is and should be according to the practitioners".|$|E
500|$|The talisman connects these precepts to {{the theory}} of vitalism; it {{physically}} represents the life force of its owner, and is reduced with each exercise of the will.

[...] "What is folly", he asks Valentin, [...] "if not an excess of will and power?" [...] Overcome with the possibilities offered by the skin, however, the young man throws caution to the wind and embraces his desire. Upon grabbing the talisman, he declares: [...] "I want to live with excess." [...] Only when his life force is nearly depleted does he recognize his mistake: [...] "It suddenly struck him that the possession of power, no matter how enormous, did not bring with it the knowledge of how to use it... had had everything in his power, and he had done nothing." ...|$|E
500|$|Away {{from its}} context as a song {{designed}} purely to {{bring attention to}} the Bengalis' cause, as Harrison himself described it, [...] "Bangla Desh" [...] has often been viewed by commentators as a rushed and underwhelming composition. Robert Rodriguez qualifies this opinion, however: [...] "As a single, the song was possibly not the most commercial of records, but as a call to service, it could scarcely have been improved upon." [...] "Bangla Desh"'s standing as rock music's first charity single is not overlooked, with Ian Inglis stating: [...] "'Bangla Desh' serves {{as a model for}} the charity singles that would become commonplace in the decades ahead, although, in this instance, the power of Harrison's song <b>lies</b> <b>not</b> in its assembly of famous performers but in its literal and absolute commitment." [...] On this point, Leng deems the song as having [...] "as much raw energy as anything [...] Plastic Ono Band ever offered". In The Dawn of Indian Music in the West, Peter Lavezzoli writes: [...] "Harrison's lyric and vocal were concise and powerful, a direct call for action in a specific crisis. As such, 'Bangla Desh' remains one of the most cogent social statements in music history." ...|$|E

500|$|Znaniecki {{coined the}} term [...] "humanistic coefficient" [...] for a method of social {{research}} by way of data analysis that emphasizes participants' perceptions of the experience being analyzed. The humanistic coefficient sees all social facts as being created by social actors and as being understandable only from their perspective. Thus the sociologist ought to study reality by trying to understand how others see the world, not (objectively) as an independent observer; in other words, the scientist needs to understand the subject's world. While some have criticized this approach as being too close to subjectivism, Znaniecki himself saw it as anti-subjectivist; he observed that social facts such as cultural systems can exist even if no one perceives their existence. He was also skeptical of any value coming from personal, subjective observations, arguing that such observations have value only {{if they can be}} objectively described. He argued that the difference between the natural and social sciences <b>lies</b> <b>not</b> in the difference between objective and subjective experiences, but in the subject being studied: for Znaniecki, the natural sciences studied things, and the social sciences studied cultural values.|$|E

500|$|Patrick Day of the Los Angeles Times {{thought that}} [...] "as far as {{penultimate}} set-up-to-the-big-finale episodes go, 'Greatest Hits' was above par {{in more than}} one way." [...] Day celebrated the return of Jack [...] "from Mt. Boring", the use of drums in Michael Giacchino's musical score and the return of Rose and Bernard. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Monaghan [...] "turned in his best performance yet on Lost" [...] and described the final scene as [...] "breathtaking" [...] with [...] "a stunningly realized, Emmy-worthy triumph of F/X." [...] Kristin Veitch of E! also enjoyed Monaghan's acting and called the episode a [...] "perfect example" [...] of the series' high quality. Charlie McCollum of the San Jose Mercury News described the latter episodes of the third season as [...] "an absolute thrill ride". Chris Carabott of IGN rated the episode as an 8.5/10, commending the character development of Jack and Charlie, and the acting skills of Emerson, who portrays Ben. Lulu Bates of Television Without Pity graded the episode as an [...] "A–". Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad rated [...] "Greatest Hits" [...] as a 6/7, saying that it succeeded in building momentum for the season finale, but pointed out the plot inconsistency regarding Charlie's (in)ability to swim. Scott Juba of The Trades decided that [...] "Greatest Hits" [...] was the best episode of the third season, saying that the flashbacks [...] "evok the type of identifiable human emotions that drives the success of Lost. The true genius of the show <b>lies</b> <b>not</b> in its plot twists or mysteries but rather in its ability to make the audience invested in the characters by evoking themes that almost anyone can identify with."
