Further study, however, revealed that {{the course of the}} disease was strikingly different between the groups. The average latent period of the high-dose group (n = 20) before the development of hyperglycaemia was only 3 days while that of the <b>low-dose</b> <b>group</b> was 7 weeks (n = 30). Islets of pancreas in the high-dose group showed extensive acute necrosis of the islets with only two out of 20 showing limited mononuclear cell infiltration. In contrast, 20 out of 30 mice in the <b>low-dose</b> <b>group</b> had 45 % of their islets heavily infiltrated with mononuclear cells (P less than 0. 001). In addition, the deposition of IgG was found in 40 % of the islets in 23 out of 30 mice in the <b>low-dose</b> <b>group,</b> in contrast to only two out of 20 in the high-dose group (P less than 0. 005). The incidence of antibody to nucleic acids, polyadenylic-polyuridylic acid, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, single-stranded DNA and anti-nuclear antibody was significantly higher in the <b>low-dose</b> <b>group</b> as compared to the high-dose group or controls (P less than 0. 01).

40|$|Objective: This {{study is}} to {{evaluate}} the anti-obese effects of glucosamine (GLC) and chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) on high-fat diet-induced obese rats. Methods: The rats were randomly divided into twelve groups: a normal diet group (NF), a high-fat diet group (HF), Orlistat group, GLC high-, middle-, and <b>low-dose</b> <b>groups</b> (GLC-H, GLC-M, GLC-L), COS 1 (COS, number-average molecular weight ≤ 1000) high-, middle-, and <b>low-dose</b> <b>groups</b> (COS 1 -H, COS 1 -M, COS 1 -L), and COS 2 (COS, number-average molecular weight ≤ 3000) high-, middle-, and <b>low-dose</b> <b>groups</b> (COS 2 -H, COS 2 -M, COS 2 -L). All groups received oral treatment by gavage once daily {{for a period of}} six weeks. Results: Rats fed with COS 1 gained the least weight among all the groups (P < 0. 01), and these rats lost more weight than those treated with Orlistat. In addition to the COS 2 -H and Orlistat groups, the serum total cholesterol (CHO) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were significantly reduced in all treatment groups compared to the HF group (P < 0. 01). The various doses of GLC, COS 1 and COS 2 reduced the expression levels of PPARγ and LXRα mRNA in the white adipose tissue. Conclusions: The results above demonstrated that GLC, COS 1, and COS 2 improved dyslipidemia and prevented body weight gains by inhibiting the adipocyte differentiation in obese rats induced by a high-fat diet.

40|$|Objective To {{observe the}} effect of Yangxueqingnao {{granules}} on c-Fos protein expression in trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) of nitroglycerin-induced migraine rats.   Methods A total of 108 healthy male Wistar rats were randomly divided into normal control group, model group, high-dose treatment <b>group,</b> <b>low-dose</b> treatment <b>group,</b> high-dose prevention and <b>low-dose</b> prevention <b>group,</b> and then each group was randomly divided into 3 subgroups: 30, 60 and 180 min group. The experimental migraine rat model was established by subcutaneous injection of nitroglycerin. The rats of normal control group were subcutaneously injected with saline solution of the same dosage. The rats of high- and <b>low-dose</b> treatment <b>group</b> were respectively administered with gastric perfusion of high- and low-dose Yangxueqingnao granules once 10 min after the modeling. The rats of high- and low- dose prevention group were respectively administered with gastric perfusion of high- and low- dose Yangxueqingnao granules for 7 d before the modeling. The rats were sacrificed and the brain tissues were collected at corresponding time points. Related behavior indexes of rats in each group were observed and recorded. TNC c-Fos protein expression changes were measured and compared among different groups.   Results At all time points, the c-Fos expression level of model group had no statistical difference from high- and <b>low-dose</b> treatment <b>group</b> (P > 0. 05, for all). However, it was higher than that in high-dose prevention group (P = 0. 031, 0. 000, 0. 000), while was only lower than that in <b>low-dose</b> prevention <b>group</b> at 60 and 180 min after modeling (P = 0. 000, for all). There was statistical difference between high- and <b>low-dose</b> prevention <b>group</b> only at 30 min after modeling (P = 0. 029).

Here, {{we examined the}} impact of acute rejection and associated risk factors. The incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection in the <b>low-dose</b> tacrolimus <b>group</b> was approximately half that of the standard-dose cyclosporine and <b>low-dose</b> cyclosporine <b>groups,</b> {{and a third of}} that in the <b>low-dose</b> sirolimus <b>group.</b> The <b>low-dose</b> cyclosporine <b>group</b> had more severe rejection episodes (>= grade II) compared with other groups. Acute rejection was associated with a 10 mL/min glomerular filtration rate (GFR) reduction and a 5. 3 % absolute increase in graft loss at 12 months. Overall, the highest GFR was found in both rejecters and non-rejecters receiving low-dose tacrolimus, both in an intent-to-treat analysis and in patients successfully treated according to the protocol. In Cox regression models, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatches and expanded criteria donors increased the acute rejection risk, while recipient age, living related donor, and MMF dose were associated with a reduced risk. Acute rejection was associated with worse outcome but did not entirely explain the differences among the treatment groups.

This study aims to assess its effects on cardiologic and hepatic biochemical indices of human subjects. Materials and methods: Subjects (n = 133, aged over 50) {{were randomly assigned to}} two groups, the first (high-dose group) ingesting daily 5 g of mastic powder and the second receiving daily a Chios mastic solution (<b>low-dose</b> <b>group).</b> Serum biochemical parameters were determined on a monthly basis for an 18 -month (high-dose group) and a 12 -month (<b>low-dose</b> <b>group)</b> follow-up period. Generalized least squares random-effects linear regression was performed. Results: The group ingesting Chios mastic powder (high-dose group) exhibited a decrease in serum total cholesterol, LDL, total cholesterol/HDL ratio, lipoprotein (a), apolipoprotein A- 1, apolipoprotein B (apoB/apoA- 1 ratio did not change), SGOT, SGPT and gamma-GT levels; in the second (<b>low-dose)</b> <b>group,</b> glucose levels decreased in males.

Tumor inhibition rate, life span of mice and the toxicity of chemotherapy were observed. The body weight, tumor weight, thymus index and spleen index in H 22 -bearing mice were also measured. The phagocytotic function of macrophages was studied by observing phagocytiz-ation of peritoneal macrophages. Results: The increase of body weight in 5 -FU plus ESB groups was higher than that in 5 -FU group, and the side effects such as anorexia, abdominal distention and athrepsy were relieved. Compared with untreated group, prolonged lifetime in 5 -FU plus high-dose ESB group and 5 -FU plus <b>low-dose</b> ESB <b>group</b> was improved. Life prolongation rates in 5 -FU plus high-dose ESB group and 5 -FU plus <b>low-dose</b> ESB <b>group</b> were 61. 46 % and 23. 59 % respectively. High-dose ESB, 5 -FU, 5 -FU plus low-dose ESB and 5 -FU plus high-dose ESB could inhibit the tumor growth, and the tumor inhibition rates were 36. 98 %, 42. 26 %, 52. 45 % and 65. 28 %, respectively. Thymus index and spleen index were increased significantly in 5 -FU plus <b>low-dose</b> ESB <b>group</b> and 5 -FU plus high-dose ESB group.

40|$|AbstractCord blood {{transplantation}} (CBT) is curative {{for many}} primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) but {{is associated with}} risks of viral infection and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Serotherapy reduces GvHD but potentially {{increases the risk of}} viral infection by delaying immune reconstitution. Because many PID patients have pre-existing viral infections, the optimal dose of serotherapy is unclear. We performed a retrospective analysis in 34 consecutive PID patients undergoing CBT and compared immune reconstitution, viral infection, GvHD, mortality, and long-term immune function between high-dose (n =  11) and low-dose (n =  9) serotherapy. Serotherapy dose had no effect on neutrophil engraftment. Median CD 3 + engraftment occurred at 92. 5 and 97  days for high- and low-dose serotherapy, respectively. The <b>low-dose</b> serotherapy <b>group</b> had higher CD 3 +, CD 4 +, and early thymic emigrant counts at 4  months compared with the high-dose group.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{estimate}} health economic consequences of the four-month primary care program ”Physical Activity on Prescription (PAP) ”. Inactivity means a highly increased independent risk factor for public health diseases and morbidity, and is an economic burden to society. Evidence for cost effective interventions aiming at increasing physical activity (PA) level among inactive individuals is limited, why health economic evaluations are an important tool when arranging priorities in health care sector. Promoting PA among inactive individuals within primary health care with a prescription of exercise has shown {{to be effective in}} terms of significantly increasing physical activity levels. The Swedish FaR® concept {{can be seen as a}} concept for improving physical activity behaviour to meet public health guidelines for a sufficient level of physical activity. The program has been implemented as a concept in Swedish health care, but without a common model nationwide. The present concept of the PAP-program in the south-east health care district of Region Skåne, Sweden was based on an existing program with treatment perspective. Specifically, the aims of the different studies were to analyze costs and consequences of changing PA behaviour from the 4 -month PAP-program [paper I], to analyze the willingness to pay (WTP) for health effects of physical activity due to the PAP-program, and examine predictors for the WTP [paper II], to analyze the cost offset of changing the PA behavior and motivation after 1 year [paper III], and to analyze the benefits in terms of quality of life and cost per QALY, respectively [paper IV]. The study was a randomized clinical trial with a 4 -month intervention. In all, 528 inactive individuals were randomized to either a high-dose or a <b>low-dose</b> <b>group.</b> The high-dose group consisted in supervised group exercise sessions twice a week during 4 months on a moderate-intense level, education in physical activity, and a motivational counselling. The <b>low-dose</b> <b>group</b> received written information on the possibility to participate in supervised exercise groups once a week on a moderate-intense level in local fitness centres. Results: A cost-consequences analysis (n= 242) showed intention-to-treat program average programme costs per participant for the 4 month PAP-program being SEK 6475 for the high-dose group and SEK 3038 for the <b>low-dose</b> <b>group</b> [paper 1]. The largest cost was the individuals’ time cost. PA level improved significantly, with no differences between the groups. In paper II, a WTP-analysis (n= 128) showed no significant differences for different health improvements between a high- and a <b>low-dose</b> <b>group,</b> and that WTP for health improvements of physical activity is influenced by a higher education level, income and BMI. Paper III examined cost-minimization and motivation of the programme at a 1 year follow-up (n= 178, 95 in the high-dose group and 83 in the <b>low-dose</b> <b>group),</b> with a drop-out rate of 66 % in both groups together. The results of a significantly improved PA level in paper II were confirmed in this study. There were no differences in motivation among completers and non-completers of the PAP-program. The cost offset consisted in reduced health care costs and value of lost production due to reduced inactivity, and was equal to 22 %. The cost-utility analysis in paper IV of the 178 individuals that returned for the 1 -year follow-up showed that the PAP-program is cost-effective, and the cost per QALY, 323, 750 SEK and 101, 267 SEK for the high- and <b>low-dose</b> <b>group,</b> is considered moderate according to Swedish reference values. A <b>low-dose</b> <b>group</b> was more cost-effective and had larger improvements in QoL than a high-dose group. QoL improved significantly in the <b>low-dose</b> <b>group</b> and in both groups together. Conclusions: The PAP-program showed that it was possible to make inactive individuals more physically active through intervention. Significant improvements in PA behaviour were shown in a one-year follow-up analysis. The results of this program of prescribed exercise showed significant increased QoL one year after intervention in a <b>low-dose</b> <b>group.</b> The best adherence for the PAP-program was found for elderly and those with relatively good baseline health. These individuals constitute the target population for this prescription based exercise program. Identifying the target population for participation in health promoting activity groups like the PAP-program is necessary for adherence, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a program. The PAP-program is cost-effective as shown in a cost-utility analysis conducted in the study. The costs per QALY estimates were considered moderate regarding to Swedish comparative values. This makes the program a method worthwhile for society. The program was most cost-effective for a <b>low-dose</b> <b>group.</b> This was showed with lower costs associated with the <b>low-dose</b> <b>group,</b> and larger improvements in QoL. An increased availability of exercise would reduce the individual’s time cost for travelling, and cost for travel. The inactive individual’s preferences for improved health through exercise were influenced by a higher education level, income and BMI. The PAP-program can reduce the society´s costs for inactivity by 22 % per individual, every year the individual stays active...|$|E

Given {{the side effects of}} this regimen, we evaluated the efficacy and the toxicity of a course of low-dose IV CYC prescribed as a remission-inducing treatment, followed by azathioprine (AZA) as a remission-maintaining treatment. METHODS: In this multicenter, prospective clinical trial (the Euro-Lupus Nephritis Trial [ELNT]), we randomly assigned 90 SLE patients with proliferative glomerulonephritis to a high-dose IV CYC regimen (6 monthly pulses and 2 quarterly pulses; doses increased according to the white blood cell count nadir) or a low-dose IV CYC regimen (6 fortnightly pulses at a fixed dose of 500 mg), each of which was followed by AZA. Intent-to-treat analyses were performed. RESULTS: Followup continued for a median of 41. 3 months in the <b>low-dose</b> <b>group</b> and 41 months in the high-dose group. Sixteen percent of those in the <b>low-dose</b> <b>group</b> and 20 % of those in the high-dose group experienced treatment failure (not statistically significant by Kaplan-Meier analysis). Levels of serum creatinine, albumin, C 3, 24 -hour urinary protein, and the disease activity scores significantly improved in both groups {{during the first year of}} followup. Renal remission was achieved in 71 % of the <b>low-dose</b> <b>group</b> and 54 % of the high-dose group (not statistically significant).

Little {{is known about the}} effect of different brand combinations of antibiotic and bone cement on the elution profile and mechanical strength of ALBC. Standardized specimens that consisted of one of the 4 brands of bone cement and one of the 3 brands of vancomycin were fashioned, producing 12 combinations of ALBC. Two dosages of vancomycin in 40 g bone cement were used to represent the high (4 g vancomycin) and low (1 g vancomycin) dose groups. Concentrations of vancomycin elution from ALBC was measured for up to 336 hours. The ultimate compression strength was tested at axial compression using a material testing machine before and after elution. In both high-dose and <b>low-dose</b> <b>groups,</b> Lyo-Vancin in PALACOS bone cement resulted in the highest cumulative elution and Vanco in Simplex P bone cement resulted in the lowest elution (458 % and 65 % higher in high- and <b>low-dose</b> <b>groups,</b> respectively). The mechanical strength was not significantly compromised in all groups with low dose vancomycin (range: 70. 31 ± 2. 74 MPa to 87. 28 ± 8. 26 MPa after elution).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Immunosuppressive regimens {{with the}} fewest {{possible}} toxic effects are desirable for transplant recipients. This study evaluated the efficacy and relative toxic effects of four immunosuppressive regimens. METHODS: We randomly assigned 1645 renal-transplant recipients to receive standard-dose cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids, or daclizumab induction, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids {{in combination with}} low-dose cyclosporine, low-dose tacrolimus, or low-dose sirolimus. The primary end point was the estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), as calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula, 12 months after transplantation. Secondary end points included acute rejection and allograft survival. RESULTS: The mean calculated GFR was higher in patients receiving low-dose tacrolimus (65. 4 ml per minute) than in the other three groups (range, 56. 7 to 59. 4 ml per minute). The rate of biopsy-proven acute rejection was lower in patients receiving low-dose tacrolimus (12. 3 %) than in those receiving standard-dose cyclosporine (25. 8 %), low-dose cyclosporine (24. 0 %), or low-dose sirolimus (37. 2 %). Allograft survival differed significantly among the four groups (P= 0. 02) and was highest in the <b>low-dose</b> tacrolimus <b>group</b> (94. 2 %), followed by the <b>low-dose</b> cyclosporine <b>group</b> (93. 1 %), the standard-dose cyclosporine group (89. 3 %), and the <b>low-dose</b> sirolimus <b>group</b> (89. 3 %). Serious adverse events were {{more common in the}} <b>low-dose</b> sirolimus <b>group</b> than in the other groups (53. 2 % vs. a range of 43. 4 to 44. 3 %), although a similar proportion of patients in each group had at least one adverse event during treatment (86. 3 to 90. 5 %). CONCLUSIONS: A regimen of daclizumab, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids in combination with low-dose tacrolimus may be advantageous for renal function, allograft survival, and acute rejection rates, as compared with regimens containing daclizumab induction plus either low-dose cyclosporine or low-dose sirolimus or with standard-dose cyclosporine without induction.

MethodsMice {{were given a}} single injection of cisplatin (8  mg/kg, i. p.); then, breviscapine was given to mice at 25  mg/kg and 50  mg/kg doses, respectively, once a day for seven days. Renal tissue structure was observed after animals were sacrificed. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Scr), lipid peroxide (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) serum levels were detected; and MDA, glutathione peroxidase, and SOD levels in the renal cortex were detected. ResultsCompared with the blank control group (BCG), the kidney pathological damage of mice in the model control group (MCG) was more severe. After applying different doses of breviscapine, different degrees of renal injury improvement appeared. Compared with the BCG, the serum levels of Scr and BUN in the MCG increased to (89. 92  ±  6. 78) μmoL/Land (15. 32  ±  4. 53) mmoL/L. The differences were statistical significant (P <  0. 01).

In vitro studies and clinical case reports revealed a possible impact of echinocandin treatment on cardiac function. The aim of our study was to evaluate echinocandin-induced cardiac failure. Using an in vivo rat model, we assessed hemodynamic param-eters and time to hemodynamic failure after central venous application (vena jugularis interna) of anidulafungin (<b>low-dose</b> <b>group,</b> 2. 5 mg/kg body weight [BW]; high-dose group, 25 mg/kg BW), caspofungin (<b>low-dose</b> <b>group,</b> 0. 875 mg/kg BW; high-dose group, 8. 75 mg/kg BW), micafungin (<b>low-dose</b> <b>group,</b> 3 mg/kg BW; high-dose group, 30 mg/kg BW), and placebo (0. 9 % sodium chloride). Left ventricular heart tissue was collected to determine mitochondrial enzyme activity via spec-trophotometric measurements. mRNA expression of transcriptional regulators and primary mitochondrial transcripts, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content, and citrate synthase activity were also explored. Animals receiving high-dose anidulafungin or caspofungin showed an immediate decrease in hemodynamic function. All of the subjects in these groups died during the observation period. Every animal in the untreated control group survived (P< 0. 001). Hemodynamic fail-ure was not noticed in the anidulafungin and caspofungin low-dose groups. Micafungin had no impact on cardiac func-tion. In analyzing mitochondrial enzyme activity and mitochondrial transcripts, we found no association between echino-candin administration and the risk for hemodynamic failure.

40|$|Despite {{improvements}} {{in the care of}} preterm infants, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) continue to be frequent occurrences in this patient population. Shunt procedures in these children are frequently complicated by obstruction and/or infection. As the hydrocephalus is usually caused by an obliterative arachnoiditis due to contact of the blood with the basilar meninges, it was postulated that infusion of urokinase into the ventricles of infants who have sustained an IVH would clear the blood, mitigate the arachnoiditis, and prevent the progression of PHH. Accordingly, 18 preterm infants who had sustained IVH and subsequently developed PHH were treated with intraventricular urokinase instilled via a surgically implanted subcutaneous reservoir. There were no complications associated with the urokinase. Infants were divided into two dosage groups: low dose (110, 000 – 140, 000 IU total) and high dose (280, 000 IU total).

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} the efficacy and bleeding complications {{associated with a}} low-dose thrombolysis protocol for thromboembolic lower extremity arterial occlusions. DesignA retrospective cohort study. Materials and methodsA retrospective analysis was performed using data from all consecutive patients who underwent catheter-directed, intra-arterial thrombolysis for thromboembolic lower extremity arterial occlusions between January 2004 and May 2013. All patients were treated on a standard surgical ward. Endpoints were incidence of bleeding complications, duration of thrombolysis, angiographic patency rate, 30 -day mortality rate, and amputation-free rate at 6 months. ResultsOf the 171 cases analyzed, 129 cases underwent low-dose thrombolysis and 42 underwent high-dose thrombolysis. No major bleeding complications occurred in the <b>low-dose</b> <b>group</b> versus 5 % in the high-dose group (p = . 01). The median duration of thrombolysis was 67 hours (4 – 304 hours) in the low-dose and 49 hours (2 – 171 hours) in the high-dose group (p = . 027). Angiographic patency was restored in 67 % of the cases in the <b>low-dose</b> <b>group</b> versus 79 % of the high-dose group (p = . 17). The 30 -day mortality rates were 1 % in the low-dose versus 5 % in the high-dose group (p = . 09). However, this higher mortality rate {{was not related to}} bleeding complications. Major amputation-free rates at 6 months were 81 % in the <b>low-dose</b> <b>group</b> and 88 % in the high-dose group (p = . 22). ConclusionsBased on this data series, low-dose thrombolysis for thromboembolic lower extremity arterial occlusions is as effective as high-dose thrombolysis; however, the risk of major bleeding complications is substantially lower when using low-dose thrombolysis...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} effects of Shenmai Injection (SMI), a {{compound}} traditional Chinese herbal medicine, on pharmacokinetics and serum concentration of digoxin when applied together with digoxin. Methods: Twenty dogs with heart failure were randomly divided into 4 groups: control group and low-, medium- and high-dose SMI groups, with 5 dogs in each group. After intravenous injection of digoxin injection at a dose of 7. 41 μg/kg, dogs {{in the control group}} were administered intravenously with normal saline 20 mL daily for 5 d, and the other groups were intravenously administered with SMI at the doses of 0. 517, 1. 034 and 1. 551 mL/kg respectively. After the administration, the blood was collected at designed time points. Serum concentration of digoxin was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS/MS). Results: The low-, medium- and high-dose SMI showed different effects on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin: the low-, medium- and high-dose SMI revealed a tendency to decrease the elimination half-life (T 1 / 2 β) of digoxin. The low-dose SMI showed a tendency to decrease the digoxin concentration. Serum clearance (CL) in the <b>low-dose</b> SMI <b>group</b> was higher than that in the control, and also significantly higher than those in the medium- and high-dose SMI groups (P< 0. 05). The area under concentration-time curve (AUC 0 →∞) in the <b>low-dose</b> SMI <b>group</b> was lower than that in the control group (P= 0. 05); the AUC 0 → 72 h and AUC 0 →∞ in the <b>low-dose</b> SMI <b>group</b> were significantly lower than those in the medium- and high-dose SMI <b>groups.</b> <b>Low-dose</b> SMI accelerated the clearance of digoxin in blood.

40|$|Chronic toxic and {{carcinogenic}} {{effects of}} gasoline engine exhaust inhalation were investigated in rats. The exhaust from the combustion of commercial fuel containing 30 ppm ferrocene additive {{was compared to}} exhaust from the same fuel without ferrocene. This study {{was part of a}} procedure to get a special authorization for the use of ferrocene as gasoline additive according to the German Gasoline Lead Act. To generate the exhausts, pairs of engines of the same type and age were operated on computer-controlled test benches in a combined urban-freeway driving cycle. The engines were equipped with three-way catalysts and lambda sensors. Rats inhaled the exhausts after dilution at ratios of about 1 : 20 and 1 : 40 for 18 h/day, 5 days/wk for 12 mo (chronic toxicity study) or for 24 mo followed by 6 mo of clean air cinogenicity study). The limiting factor for the exhaust concentration was the relative humidity of the exposure atmosphere. At defined intervals, body weight and food consumption, parameters of clinical chemistry, hematology, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and mechanical lung function were measured, as well as lung clearance and particle retention in the lungs. In the high-dose groups and the controls the complete organ/tissue spectrum was investigated histopathologically, and in the <b>low-dose</b> <b>groups</b> the respiratory tract. Only slight exposure-related effects could be detected, like a loss in the background iron content of the cell pellet of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cytoplasmic inclusions and goblet-cell hyperplasias in the nasal cavity. Between the clean-air controls and the exhaust-exposed groups, no exposure-related differences occurred in body weight development, mortality incidences, or any of the clinical investigations. Ninety-two to 94 % of the animals developed age-related tumors, predominantly in the mammary glands, uterus, adrenals, thyroid, and pituitary. In the respiratory tract a total of five tumors was found: one in the controls and four in the <b>low-dose</b> <b>groups.</b> No physical, chemical, or toxicological differences between the exhausts from fuel without or with ferrocene were demonstrated...|$|R

However, only the <b>low-dose</b> SB <b>group</b> had a MBFi ratio close to unity (0.99), with or without RPP adjustment. Similar to NE-stress in the NOS-inhibition and eNOS-knockout <b>groups</b> above, the <b>low-dose</b> SB flow response was completely blocked therefore reflecting EFRNOM (Figure  5). In contrast, the high-dose SB group maintained a MBF response significantly greater than unity (1.39), suggesting that the β 2 -adrenergic agonist is only partially endothelial-dependent and NO-mediated at this dose, with the remaining increase being dependent on non-NO-mediated mechanisms. With SB-stress, NOS-inhibition mice showed no significant hemodynamic changes vs. normal controls (Table  3). These results demonstrate that the high-dose and low-dose SB-stress/rest flow responses were partially and completely NO-mediated, respectively. Low-dose SB appeared to specifically reflect the NO-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilatation (i.e., EFRNOM).|$|R

Methods: The study cohort was 173 patients, 85 of whom were given 30 mCi of radioiodine and the others were given 100 mCi of radioiodine. Follow-up involved neck ultrasonography, measurement of serum levels of thyroglobulin and whole-body scans to evaluate the response of radioiodine treatment. All patients were assessed for adverse effects. Results: Of the 173 patients, 170 (98. 3 %) patients finally achieved successful ablation. The prevalence of successful ablation was 77. 6 % in the <b>low-dose</b> <b>group</b> versus 71. 5 % in the high-dose group after the first dose administration (P= 0. 36), 79 % in the <b>low-dose</b> <b>group</b> versus 88 % in the high-dose group after the second dose administration (P= 0. 416), and 97. 6 % in the <b>low-dose</b> <b>group</b> versus 98. 9 % in the high-dose group after the final ablation (P= 0. 54). We found no significant differences between the two groups. No patient had an adverse effect with a severity grade > 2 and the prevalence of adverse effects in the high-dose group was higher than that in the <b>low-dose</b> <b>group,</b> especially for nausea, neck pain, and sore throat. Conclusion: These data suggest that a low dose of radioiodine is as effective as a high dose of radioiodine for ablation of the thyroid remnant after total thyroidectomy for low-risk DTC. Moreover, low-dose radioiodine therapy is associated with a lower prevalence of adverse events. Keywords: differentiated thyroid cancer, radioiodine, radiotherapy, thyroglobuli...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Allogeneic blood {{transfusion}} and reoperation for postoperative bleeding after the {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting {{have a negative impact}} on the patient outcome. This study aimed at evaluating the effects of reduced doses of heparin and protamine on the patient outcome, using a heparin-coated mini-cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) system. METHODS: Sixty patients undergoing elective first-time CPB were prospectively randomized either to have a reduced systemic heparinization [activated clotting time (ACT) = 250 s] or to a control group perfused with a full heparin dose (ACT = 420 s). Blood transfusions, ventilation time, early postoperative bleeding, ICU stay, reoperations for bleeding, postoperative cognitive status and the level of mobilization were registered. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were randomized to the control group, 27 patients to the <b>low-dose</b> <b>group</b> and 4 patients were excluded because of protocol violations. Four patients in the control group received a total of 10 units of packed red blood cells, and in the <b>low-dose</b> <b>group,</b> no transfusions were given, P = 0. 046. No patient was reoperated because of bleeding. The ICU stay was significantly shorter in the <b>low-dose</b> <b>group</b> (8. 4 vs 13. 7 h, P = 0. 020), less dependent on oxygen on the first postoperative day (78 vs 97 %, P = 0. 034), better mobilized (89 vs 59 %, P = 0. 006) and had less pain (visual analogue scale 2. 0 vs 3. 5, P = 0. 019) compared with the control group.

40|$|PURPOSE: Although [(18) F]FDG PET {{can measure}} therapy {{response}} sooner and more accurately than morphological imaging techniques, {{there is still}} some debate as to whether [(18) F]FDG uptake really reflects changes in the viable cell fraction. In this study changes in [(18) F]FDG uptake were investigated in a lymphoma model at several time-points after treatment and with different doses of chemotherapy. Data were analysed in terms of several parameters. METHODS: SCID mice were subcutaneously inoculated with 5 x 10 (6) Daudi cells in the right thigh. One group was not treated (control group). The other groups received cyclophosphamide 75 mg/kg (<b>low-dose</b> <b>group),</b> 125 mg/kg (medium-dose group) and 175 mg/kg (high-dose group) on day 0. Sequential [(18) F]FDG small-animal PET (microPET) scans were performed on days 0, 2, 6, 9, 13 and 16 after treatment. The mean and maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(mean) and SUV(max)), metabolic tumour volume (Vol(metab)) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were calculated. RESULTS: A significant decrease in [(18) F]FDG uptake was observed on day 2 in the medium-dose and high-dose groups and on day 6 in the <b>low-dose</b> <b>group,</b> all preceding morphological changes. SUV(mean) and SUV(max) formed a plateau from day 6 to day 9, corresponding to the known influx of inflammatory cells. No obvious plateau was observed with TLG which was found to be the most sensitive parameter clearly differentiating the <b>low-dose</b> <b>group</b> from the medium- and high-dose groups early after therapy. CONCLUSION: [(18) F]FDG uptake was able to reflect the dose-response relationship for cyclophosphamide.

After 28 d, we assayed endothelial function and LDL susceptibility to ex vivo copper-mediated oxidation. Acetylcholine-and A 23187 -mediated endothelium-dependent relaxations were significantly impaired in the cholesterol group (P < 0. 001 vs. control), but preserved in the <b>low-dose</b> AT <b>group</b> (P = NS vs. control). Compared to the control and cholesterol groups, vessels from the high-dose AT group demonstrated profound impairment of arterial relaxation (P < 0. 05) and significantly more intimal proliferation than other groups (P < 0. 05). In normal vessels, alpha-tocopherol had no effect on endothelial function. LDL derived from both the high- and <b>low-dose</b> AT <b>groups</b> was more resistant to oxidation than LDL from control animals (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the preven-tative effect of Astragalus flavescens on hepatic fibrosis in rats and its mechanism of action. A total of 60 rats were randomly divided into normal control, model control, high-dose treatment and <b>low-dose</b> treatment <b>groups,</b> and a hepatic fibrosis model was established. The high- and <b>low-dose</b> treatment <b>groups</b> were treated with 2 g/ 100 g and 0. 5 g/ 100 g Astragalus flavescens, respectively, once a day. Eight weeks following the initiation of treatment, the liver specimens of the rats were stained and observed under a light microscope. Hepatic fibrosis indices, specifically, type III precollagen (PC III), type IV collagen (C IV), hyaluronic acid (HA) and laminin (LN), were detected. Furthermore, the expression and localization of the hepatic fibrosis-related factors transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β 1), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) were deter-mined. The serum levels of hepatic fibrosis indices, and the liver tissue levels of hepatic fibrosis-related factors and collagen surface density in the model control group and the high- and <b>low-dose</b> treatment <b>groups</b> were significantly higher compared with those of the normal control group (P< 0. 05). In addition, the values in the two treatment groups were significantly lower compared with those of the model control group (P< 0. 05). The present study demonstrated that Astragalus flavescens effec-tively prevents hepatic fibrosis in rats. A possible mechanism for this is that it may reduce the expression levels of TGF-β 1, PDGF-BB and CTGF, thereby inhibiting the activation of hepatic stellate cells and specifically blocking the signal trans-duction pathway of hepatic fibrosis...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose—New therapies for {{cerebral}} vasospasm after {{subarachnoid hemorrhage}} are needed {{because of its}} high morbidity and mortality rates. We investigated the feasibility and safety of a single dose of intravenous dantrolene {{and its effect on}} transcranial Doppler in cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Methods—In a prospective, open-label, single-dose ascending safety trial, 5 patients received intravenous dantrolene 1. 25 mg/kg and the next 5 patients received 2. 5 mg/kg over the course of 60 minutes. All other infusions were kept steady and hemodynamic parameters were recorded. Transcranial Doppler was performed at 0, 45, 90, and 135 minutes relative to infusion start. Basic chemistries, serum osmolality, arterial blood gas, and liver enzymes were measured before and after. Results—Laboratory values and hemodynamic parameters remained unchanged except for a decrease in the systolic blood pressure in the <b>low-dose</b> <b>group</b> (8 mm Hg; 95 % CI, 26 to 10 mm Hg; P 0. 027). After correcting for this decrease in blood pressure, peak systolic transcranial Doppler velocities decreased significantly (26 cm/s; 95 % CI, 47 to 5 cm/s; P 0. 02), with a borderline change in mean velocities in the <b>low-dose</b> <b>group</b> (16 cm/s; 95 % CI, 36 to 4 cm/s; P 0. 07) and peak systolic transcranial Doppler velocity in the high-dose group (26 cm/s; 95 % CI, 56 to 5 cm/s; P 0. 05). Conclusions—In this pilot study, a single dose of intravenous dantrolene in cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage appears feasible while inhibiting vasoconstriction in the <b>low-dose</b> <b>group,</b> but it may lower blood pressure.

BackgroundClinicians have questioned whether patients need to reach the target beta-blocker dose to receive benefit. MethodsOutcome (Cox-adjusted) was compared with all placebo patients with dose available at the three-month visit (n = 1, 845). ResultsData indicated somewhat higher risk in the <b>low-dose</b> <b>group</b> compared with the high-dose group. Heart rate was reduced to a similar degree in the two dose groups, indicating higher sensitivity for beta-blockade in the <b>low-dose</b> <b>group.</b> The reduction in total mortality with metoprolol CR/XL compared with placebo was similar: 38 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 16 to 55) in high-dose group (p = 0. 0022) and also 38 % (95 % CI, 11 to 57) in the <b>low-dose</b> <b>group</b> (p = 0. 010).

Methods: H 22 {{cells were cultured in}} vitro and divided into 5 groups: blank control <b>group,</b> <b>low-dose</b> ESB <b>group,</b> medium-dose ESB group, high-dose ESB group and fluorouracil (5 -Fu) group. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay was utilized to determine the proliferation rates of H 22 cells. Cellular morphology was observed under a transmission electron microscope (EM). The rhodamine 123 was used as a fluorescence probe to label the H 22 cells, and the fluorescence intensities were observed with a laser scanning confocal microscope. The fluorescence intensity of H 22 cells indicated the MTP of H 22 cells. Results: The inhibition of serum containing ESB on the proliferation of H 22 cells in vitro was observerd in a time-dependent manner. The typical morphological changes of apoptosis were observed after incubation with ESB-containing serum in high dose for 48 h. The apoptosis rate of blank control group, 5 -Fu <b>group,</b> <b>low-dose</b> ESB <b>group,</b> medium-dose ESB group and high-dose ESB group were (0. 51 ± 0. 32) %, (11. 26 ± 2. 97) %, (1. 07 ± 0. 46) %, (3. 15 ± 1. 12) %, (7. 83 ± 2. 25) % respectively. ESB could reduce the MTP of H 22 cells from mice as compared with those in the untreated group.
