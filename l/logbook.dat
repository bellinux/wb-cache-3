5|$|On 21 September, Nightstalkers flying MH-60 and Little Birds {{took off}} from the frigate USS Jarrett to track an Iranian ship, Iran Ajr. The Nightstalkers {{observed}} Iran Ajr turn off her lights and begin laying mines. After receiving permission to attack, the helicopters fired guns and rockets, stopping the ship. As Iran Ajrs crew began to push mines over the side, the helicopters resumed firing until the crew abandoned ship. Special Boat Teams provided security while a SEAL team boarded the vessel at first light and discovered nine mines on the vessel's deck, {{as well as a}} <b>logbook</b> revealing areas where previous mines had been laid. The <b>logbook</b> implicated Iran in mining international waters.|$|E

5|$|The Five Nights at Freddy's: Survival <b>Logbook</b> is the series's second guidebook. It {{was first}} {{discovered}} on Amazon on mid 2017. Although {{it has never}} been confirmed by Cawthon himself, several suggestions have stated that the guidebook will explore simple activities for children as they play the video games, or to familiarize new players to the game play of Five Nights at Freddy's. This new title is surmised to have crossword puzzles and word searches, instead of hidden lore or narrative hints about the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise. Unlike most of the previous book releases, the Survival <b>Logbook</b> has no listed Amazon Kindle editions, implying that it will have pages designed for physical writing as opposed to simply reading from a device. The book is scheduled for release on December 26, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Mölders {{and members}} of JG 53 {{spent a couple of}} weeks of R skiing in the Vorarlberg before {{continuing}} operations against the RAF over the Channel and occupied France during early 1941. His new wingman from January 1941 was Oberleutnant Hartmann Grasser. Mölders claimed his first aerial victory after the lengthy vacation on 10 February 1941; his tally reached 60 on 26 February and stood at 68 when the Geschwader was recalled from the Channel front. His <b>logbook</b> showed 238 combat missions plus an additional 71 reconnaissance flights; he had engaged in aerial combat 70 times.|$|E
5|$|When {{the news}} of Zong voyage reached Britain, the ship's owners claimed {{compensation}} from their insurers {{for the loss of}} the slaves. The insurers refused to honour the claim and the owners took them to court. Zongs <b>logbook</b> went missing after the ship reached Jamaica, two years before the hearings started. The legal proceedings provide almost all the documentary evidence about the massacre but there is no formal record of the first trial other than what is referred to in the appeals hearing. The ship's insurers claimed that the log had been deliberately destroyed, which the Gregson syndicate denied.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though in}} his 1955 book Egypt's Destiny, Naguib wrote that his brigade's {{successful}} stand was a glorious victory with few consequences, estimating 450 Israeli dead (out of a perceived 4,000 attackers), a <b>logbook</b> captured by Israel {{during the war}} revealed that he was extremely worried about the future fate of his forces. He requested immediate assistance, including air support to determine {{the location of the}} Israeli cannons, a medevac unit, reinforcements, munitions and communication wires. It is also likely that he believed that the 53rd Battalion's force blocking the road from Majdal was still in place, and therefore thought that he was surrounded.|$|E
5|$|Over 2,500 people {{attended}} his memorial at Westminster Cathedral. A rose was {{planted in the}} memorial garden in Baldonnel Aerodrome in Dublin (home of the Irish Air Corps) where Brendan and his brother Ray first flew. Finucane's name is also inscribed on the Air Forces Memorial at Runnymede. The memorial commemorates airmen who {{were lost in the}} Second World War and who have no known grave. The Battle of Britain Memorial on London's Embankment also includes his name as one of The Few. His flying <b>logbook</b> can be viewed in the Soldiers and Chief's exhibition in the National Museum of Ireland at Collins Barracks. The Finucane family donated Brendan Finucane's uniform to the Royal Air Force Museum London.|$|E
5|$|The Bratvaag {{left the}} island to {{continue}} its scheduled hunting and observations, {{with the intent of}} coming back later to see if the ice had melted further and uncovered more artifacts. Further discoveries were made by the M/K Isbjørn of Tromsø, Norway, a sealing sloop chartered by news reporters to waylay the Bratvaag. Unsuccessful in this, the reporters and the Isbjørn crew made instead for Kvitøya, landing on the island on September 5 in fine weather and finding even less ice than the Bratvaag had. After photographing the area, they searched for and found Frankel's body, and additional artifacts, including a tin box containing Strindberg's photographic film, his <b>logbook</b> and maps. The crews of both ships turned over their finds to a scientific commission of the Swedish and Norwegian governments in Tromsø on September 2 and 16, respectively. The bodies of the three explorers were transported to Stockholm, arriving on October 5.|$|E

5|$|His {{military}} training began on 6 April 1936 at the 2nd Air Warfare School (Luftkriegsschule 2) at Gatow, on the south-western outskirts of Berlin. He swore the National Socialist {{oath of allegiance}} on 21 April 1936. Flight training began on Monday, 7 August 1936 at Gatow. His first flight was in a Heinkel He 72 Kadet D-EYZA single engine biplane. Lent logged his first solo flight on 15 September 1936 in a Focke-Wulf Fw 44 Stieglitz. By this time, Lent had accumulated 63 flights in his <b>logbook.</b> In conjunction with flight training, the students also learned to drive motorcycles and cars and during one of these training exercises, Lent {{was involved in a}} road accident, breaking his upper leg badly enough to prevent him from flying for five months. This did not adversely affect his classroom training and on 1 April 1937, after taking his commission examination, he was promoted to Fähnrich. On 19 October 1937 Lent completed his flight training and was awarded the A/B License. He earned his wings on 15 November 1937. On 1 February 1938, he was promoted to Oberfähnrich (first ensign), and on 1 March 1938 to Leutnant. By this time, he had made 434 flights in eight different types of aircraft and had accumulated 112 hours and 48 minutes flying time, mostly in daylight flights, in single engine training aircraft.|$|E
