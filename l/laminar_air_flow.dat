Methods The air samples were collected at different time points: 10 min after laminar flow system turned on, 10 min, 45 min after operation and 10 min before operation finished. Plate exposure method was used to detect the bacteria number. The samples collected at the same time points without the local laminar flow system open were taken as the control [...] Results When the local <b>air</b> <b>laminar</b> <b>flow</b> system was used, the bacterial concentration in the surgery was significantly lower (p< 0. 05). Meanwhile, the bacterial concentration in the laminar region was significantly lower than that among the peripheral region(p< 0. 05). The cleanliness at the time point of 45 min after operation, in the laminar area reached the level of 10 min after laminar flow system turned on. When compared with the laminar region, the bacterial concentration in peripheral areas were significantly increased both at time points of 10 min after operation and 10 min before operation finished(p< 0. 05). Conclusion Local <b>air</b> <b>laminar</b> <b>flow</b> system can filter the air in the surgery, enabling the air cleanliness to reach ten thousand grade.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine whether dimples on a heat sink fin can increase heat transfer for laminar airflows. This was accomplished by performing experimental studies using {{two different types of}} dimples: 1) circular (spherical) dimples, and 2) oval (elliptical) dimples. Dimples were placed on both sides of a aluminium plate with a relative pitch of S/D= 1. 21 and relative depth of δ/D= 0. 16 (e. g., circular dimples). For oval dimples, similar ratios with the same total depth and circular-edge-to-edge distance as the circular dimples were used. For those configurations the average heat transfer coefficient, pressure drop, thermal performance and Nusselt number ratio were determined experimentally. For circular and oval dimples, heat transfer enhancements (relative to a flat plate) were observed for Reynolds number range from 600 to 2000 (Reynolds number based on channel height). Also the results are validated analytically for Nusselt number and friction factor for plain vertical plate. This experiment was undertaken to provide the needed experimental data that fill the gap for the use of dimples for laminar flow conditions.

40|$|Implanting {{prostheses}} to {{the joints}} are frequent surgical procedures today. The improvements in medical technology and surgical techniques {{in recent years}} have decreased the risk of infection. Prosthesis infections (PIs) are classified into two categories according to their onset and clinical parameters. Classifying due to the onset is the most frequently used method. According to this approach the infections are labeled as early, delayed and late. Although numerous microorganisms cause PI, the most frequent causative agents are staphylococci. In early PIs the most common agents are gr (-) bacilli and Staphylococcus aureus, while coagulase negative staphylococci are more frequent in delayed PIs. In the diagnosis of PIs sonification of the prostheses is the new diagnostic methodology along with clinical, microbiological, pathological, and radiological methods. Today, combined medical and surgical approaches are preferred in the management of PIs. Debridement, DAIR (Debridement, Antibiotics, Implant retention) and replacement arthroplasties are applied as the surgical procedures. Replacement arthroplasties are performed in one or two steps. One of the most critical issues in the management of PIs is the duration of treatment. In general, antibiotics are given for three months in hip PIs, for six months in knee PIs. However, the duration of antibiotic therapy is interrelated to the surgical procedure applied. In debridement, DAIR, an one-step replacement arthroplasties the durations are three and six months in hip and knee PIs respectively. But, in two-steps replacement arthroplasties the duration of treatment was determined as six weeks unless a new infection ensues.

J. Mech. Appl. Math. 4, 42 (1951) ] theory. This profile was then used to calculate the spatial growth rates by solving the Orr-Sommerfeld equations. The simulation shows that the growth of the boundary layer affects the exponential growth of water waves along the fetch. The sensitivity of the growth rate is observed to vary by a factor of 2 for changes in the laminar velocity profile as small as 2 % at the water surface. This indicates that the interfacial instability is strongly influenced by the wind-induced surface current. A laminar airflow was produced in the wind tunnel over mechanically generated monochromatic gravity-capillary water waves with the ka value in the order of 10 ? 3. The novel experiment was designed to measure the minute changes in the wave slope and phase velocity simultaneously using a highly sensitive reflected twin laser beam technique.

Such gloveboxes can be very effective in preventing exposure of an operator to a toxic drug.

In these cases, the glove boxes were problematic due to inappropriate design or controls (e.g., insufficient disinfection, transfer of contaminated materials, ingress of lower quality air into glovebox, poor design/integrity, poor transfers). However, if gloveboxes are very meticulously designed, thoroughly disinfected (e.g., using a sporadic) and carefully operated by well-trained aseptic processing personnel to prevent introduction of microbial contamination, it is possible to obtain some degree of increased sterile product protection versus the simple traditional LAF hood.|$|E
50|$|The common ostrich has {{no sweat}} glands, and under heat stress {{they rely on}} panting to reduce their body temperature. Panting {{increases}} evaporative heat (and water) loss from its respiratory surfaces, therefore forcing air and heat removal without the loss of metabolic salts. Panting allows the common ostrich {{to have a very}} effective respiratory evaporative water loss (REWL). Heat dissipated by respiratory evaporation increases linearly with ambient temperature, matching the rate of heat production. As a result of panting the common ostrich should eventually experience alkalosis. However, The CO2 concentration in the blood does not change when hot ambient temperatures are experienced. This effect is caused by a lung surface shunt. The lung is not completely shunted, allowing enough oxygen to fulfill the bird’s metabolic needs. The common ostrich utilizes gular fluttering, rapid rhythmic contraction and relaxation of throat muscles, in a similar way to panting. Both these behaviors allow the ostrich to actively increase the rate of evaporative cooling. In hot temperatures water is lost via respiration. Moreover, varying surface temperatures within the respiratory tract contribute differently to overall heat and water loss through panting. The surface temperature of the gular area is 38 C; that of the tracheal area, between 34 and 36 C; and that of both anterior and posterior air sacs, 38 C. The long trachea, being cooler than body temperature, is a site of water evaporation. As ambient air becomes hotter, additional evaporation can take place lower in the trachea making its way to the posterior sacs, shunting the lung surface. The trachea acts as a buffer for evaporation because of the length, and the controlled vascularization. The Gular is also heavily vascularized; its purpose is for cooling blood, but also evaporation, as previously stated. Air flowing through the trachea can be either laminar or turbulent depending {{on the state of the}} bird. When the common ostrich is breathing normally, under no heat stress, air flow is laminar.

[...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringIn {{order to}} better {{understand}} the effect of microstructure parameters on forced convection pressure losses in graphite foam, correlations were developed for the permeability and form coefficient that appear in the porous media momentum equation. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were carried out for <b>laminar,</b> periodic <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> through an idealized pore geometry. Simulations were performed for foams {{with a wide range of}} pore diameter and inter-pore window diameter and porosity ranging from 0. 75 to 0. 85. The results of the simulations are validated using experimental results in literature within a certain range of values of the ratio of pore diameter to inter-pore window diameter. Expressions for the permeability and form coefficient as functions of pore diameter, inter-pore window diameter and porosity are developed using the results of the numerical simulations. To develop the permeability expression, an analogy was drawn to fully developed laminar flow through a pipe with an added term to account for the effect of porosity. To develop the form coefficient expression, it was assumed that the inertial effects on pressure drop are dominated by the ratio of the pore diameter to inter-pore window diameter. Terms to account for the effect of porosity were also added. The expressions are applicable within the ranges of Reynolds number, porosity, and pore diameter to inter-pore window diameter values that were validated. The proposed expressions are intended to be used in future studies related to the application of graphite foam in convective heat transfer applications...|$|R

Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) admixtures are the most complex systems which contain amino acids, carbohydrates, lipid emulsion, macroelectrolytes (Na+, K+, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Cl-, SO 42 -, PO 43 -), oligoelements, hydro- and liposoluble vitamines, heparin, insulin and water. Concerning the mentioned complexity, special attention should be payed to physicochemical and microbiological stability of a mixture, because of interactions among components, {{that can be very}} hard to analyze. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the problem of stability of TPN admixtures prepared in a hospital pharmacy. Methods. Admixture TPN was aseptically prepared in <b>laminar</b> <b>air</b> - <b>flow</b> environment on the basis of the specified order in supplementing components and additives to basic solutions. Solutions were kept in sterile multicompartment ethylene-vinyl-acetate bags. After preparation and slow homogenization, TPN admixtures were submitted to physicochemical and microbiological stability analyses in various period of time. The assessment of physical stability of TPN admixture was done on the basis of visual inspection, determination of pH value and measuring of particle size. The investigation of sterility and pyrogenic test were performed according to Ph. Yug. V regulations. Results. Physico-chemical and microbiological analyses were applied and no significant changes in visual sense, pH value and droplet size stability of the TPN admixture were observed during the period of 60 hours. The lipid droplets were smaller in size than 5 μm, that is the most common pharmacopoeia requirement. Conclusion. The results of our study confirmed that a TPN admixture prepared in a hospital pharmacy can be stored without stability loss for at least 60 hours...|$|R

This study aimed at evaluating the Bipolaris euphorbiae production in a solid medium (fermentation in solid substrate) and in a biphasic system (growth in a liquid medium followed by growth in a solid medium), as well as determining the processes for collecting and drying conidia, under laboratory conditions. The influence of the incubation period and inoculum quantity were also investigated. The conidia were dried by using an oven (30 ºC, 35 ºC, 40 ºC, 45 ºC, 50 ºC, 55 ºC and 60 ºC), and <b>laminar</b> <b>flow,</b> continuous <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> and aseptic chamber at room temperature. Dry conidia were obtained by sieving and grinding in a ball mill, hammer mill or grain grinder. The conidia viability and sporulation efficiency were evaluated in the solid medium and in the biphasic system. For growth period, the best sporulation on solid medium was obtained after 10 days of incubation, reaching 8. 3 x 10 (7) conidia g- 1 of substrate. The biphasic system did not increase the B. euphorbiae sporulation (4. 5 x 10 (7) conidia g- 1 of substrate), after 14 days, {{and the amount of}} liquid inoculum used in this system was not an important factor for increasing its production. The continuous <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> and <b>laminar</b> flow preserved the conidial viability (94. 6 % and 99. 1 %, respectively), while promoting a great moisture loss (62. 6 % and 54. 0 %, respectively). All the grinding processes reduced the conidia germination (86. 2 %, 10. 5 % and 12 %, respectively), while sieving allowed the collecting of powdered conidia with high viability (94. 8 %) ...|$|R
