5|$|Among these, Anopheles {{mosquitoes}} transmit malaria, filariasis, and arboviruses; Aedes aegypti mosquitoes carry {{dengue fever}} and the Zika virus; blackflies carry river blindness; sand flies carry <b>leishmaniasis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Life {{expectancy}} {{at birth}} {{is estimated to}} be 54.71 years in 2012, among the lowest in the world. Endemic diseases include dengue fever, filariasis, <b>leishmaniasis,</b> malaria, meningitis, schistosomiasis, and sleeping sickness. The HIV/AIDS seroprevalence rate is estimated at 5.4% for those aged 15–49, although a strong stigma against the illness keeps the number of reported cases artificially low. Breast ironing, a traditional practice that is prevalent in Cameroon, may affect girls' health. Female genital mutilation (FGM), while not widespread, is practiced among some populations; according to a 2013 UNICEF report, 1% of women in Cameroon have undergone FGM. Traditional healers remain a popular alternative to evidence-based medicine.|$|E
5|$|Rodents {{are also}} {{significant}} vectors of disease. The black rat, with the fleas that it carries, plays a primary role in spreading the bacterium Yersinia pestis responsible for bubonic plague, and carries the organisms responsible for typhus, Weil's disease, toxoplasmosis and trichinosis. A number of rodents carry hantaviruses, including the Puumala, Dobrava and Saaremaa viruses, which can infect humans. Rodents {{also help to}} transmit diseases including babesiosis, cutaneous <b>leishmaniasis,</b> human granulocytic anaplasmosis, Lyme disease, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, Powassan virus, rickettsialpox, relapsing fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and West Nile virus.|$|E
5|$|An evasion {{strategy}} used {{by several}} pathogens {{to avoid the}} innate immune system is to hide within the cells of their host (also called intracellular pathogenesis). Here, a pathogen spends most of its life-cycle inside host cells, where it is shielded from direct contact with immune cells, antibodies and complement. Some examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses, the food poisoning bacterium Salmonella and the eukaryotic parasites that cause malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and <b>leishmaniasis</b> (Leishmania spp.). Other bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, live inside a protective capsule that prevents lysis by complement. Many pathogens secrete compounds that diminish or misdirect the host's immune response. Some bacteria form biofilms {{to protect themselves from}} the cells and proteins of the immune system. Such biofilms are present in many successful infections, e.g., the chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia infections characteristic of cystic fibrosis. Other bacteria generate surface proteins that bind to antibodies, rendering them ineffective; examples include Streptococcus (protein G), Staphylococcus aureus (protein A), and Peptostreptococcus magnus (protein L).|$|E
5|$|Some golden jackals carry {{diseases}} and parasites harmful to human health. These include rabies, and Donovan's Leishmania that is harmless to jackals but may cause <b>leishmaniasis</b> in people. Jackals in southwestern Tajikistan can carry up to 16 species of parasitic cestodes (flatworm), roundworms, and acanthocephalans (thorny-headed worms), these being: Sparganum mansoni, Diphyllobothrium mansonoides, Taenia hydatigena, T.pisiformis, Taenia ovis, Hydatigera taeniaeformis, Dipylidium caninum, Mesocestoides lineatus, Ancylostoma caninum, Uncinaria stenocephala, Dioctophyma renale, Toxocara canis, Toxascaris leonina, Dracunculus medinensis, Filariata and Macracanthorhynchus catulinum. Jackals infected with Dracunculus medinensis can infect {{bodies of water}} with their eggs, which cause dracunculiasis in people who drink from them. Jackals may also play a large part in spreading coenurosis in sheep and cattle, and canine distemper in dogs. In Tajikistan, jackals carry at least 12 tick species (which include Ixodes, Rhipicephalus turanicus, R. leporis, R. rossicus, R. sanguineus, R. pumilio, R. schulzei, Hyalomma anatolicum, H. scupense and H. asiaticum), four flea species (Pulex irritans, Xenopsylla nesokiae, Ctenocephanlides canis and C. felis), and one species of louse (Trichodectes canis).|$|E
25|$|Besides humans, {{cutaneous}} <b>leishmaniasis</b> often affects other animals, {{notably in}} dogs as canine <b>leishmaniasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Visceral <b>leishmaniasis</b> (VL), {{also known}} as kala-azar, black fever, and Dumdum fever, is the most severe form of <b>leishmaniasis</b> and, without proper {{diagnosis}} and treatment, is associated with high fatality. <b>Leishmaniasis</b> is a disease caused by protozoan parasites of the Leishmania genus.|$|E
25|$|Cutaneous <b>leishmaniasis</b> (also {{known as}} oriental sore, {{tropical}} sore, chiclero ulcer, chiclero's ulcer or Aleppo boil) {{is the most}} common form of <b>leishmaniasis</b> affecting humans. It is a skin infection caused by a single-celled parasite that is transmitted by the bite of a phlebotomine sandfly. There are about twenty species of Leishmania that may cause cutaneous <b>leishmaniasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Leishmaniasis</b> {{is mostly}} a disease of the {{developing}} world, and is rarely known {{in the developed world}} outside a small number of cases, mostly in instances where troops are stationed away from their home countries. <b>Leishmaniasis</b> has been reported by U.S. troops stationed in Saudi Arabia and Iraq since the Gulf War of 1990, including visceral <b>leishmaniasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cutaneous <b>leishmaniasis</b> is endemic in all {{tropical}} and subtropical {{areas of}} the world. The distribution of this disease is very tightly linked to geography, and villages even 15miles apart can have very different rates of cutaneous <b>leishmaniasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mucocutaneous <b>leishmaniasis</b> is an {{especially}} disturbing form of cutaneous <b>leishmaniasis,</b> because it produces destructive and disfiguring lesions of the face. It is most often caused by Leishmania braziliensis, but cases caused by L. aethiopica have also been described.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{bacterial}} infection (especially with Staphylococcus aureus) is common and may require antibiotics. Clinicians who are unfamiliar with cutaneous <b>leishmaniasis</b> may mistake the lesion for a pure {{bacterial infection}} (especially after isolation of S. aureus from bacterial skin swabs) {{and fail to}} consider the possibility of <b>leishmaniasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cutaneous <b>leishmaniasis</b> is {{the most}} common form, which causes an open sore at the bite sites, which heals in a few months to a year and half, leaving an unpleasant-looking scar. Diffuse {{cutaneous}} <b>leishmaniasis</b> produces widespread skin lesions which resemble leprosy, and may not heal on its own.|$|E
25|$|Some species tend {{to cause}} {{cutaneous}} <b>leishmaniasis</b> (e.g., L. major and L.tropica), whereas some species tend to cause visceral <b>leishmaniasis</b> (e.g., L. infantum and L. donovani), though emerging research (due to high deployment rates of western countries to indigenous areas) is showing these species specific presentation lines are blurring.|$|E
25|$|Dogs and rodents {{serve as}} the primary animal {{reservoir}} hosts in the sylvatic cycle, but people with chronic PKDL can also serve as important reservoir hosts for cutaneous <b>leishmaniasis.</b> The most common vectors for cutaneous <b>leishmaniasis</b> in the Old World are sandflies of the genus Phlebotomus, while Lutzomyia and those within the family Psychodidae (especially the genus Psychodopygus) {{are the most common}} vectors in the New World. There are more than 600 species of phlebotomine sandflies, and only 30 of these are known vectors. Cutaneous <b>leishmaniasis</b> has been seen in American and Canadian troops coming back from Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|The Indian medical {{practitioner}} Upendra Nath Brahmachari {{was nominated for}} the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1929 for his discovery of ureastibamine (an antimonial compound {{for the treatment of}} kala-azar) and a new disease, post kala-azar dermal <b>leishmaniasis.</b> Brahmachari's cure for visceral <b>leishmaniasis</b> was the urea salt of para-amino-phenyl stibnic acid which he called Urea Stibamine.|$|E
25|$|The {{disease is}} found {{across much of}} Asia, and in the Middle East. Within Afghanistan, <b>leishmaniasis</b> occurs {{commonly}} in Kabul, partly due to bad sanitation and waste left uncollected in streets, allowing parasite-spreading sand flies an environment they find favorable. In Kabul, {{the number of people}} infected was estimated to be at least 200,000, and in three other towns (Herat, Kandahar, and Mazar-i-Sharif) about 70,000 more occurred, according to WHO figures from 2002. Kabul is estimated as the largest center of cutaneous <b>leishmaniasis</b> in the world, with around 67,500 cases as of 2004. Africa, in particular the East and North, is also home to cases of <b>leishmaniasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} {{around the}} treatment of cutaneous <b>leishmaniasis</b> is poor. A number of topical treatments {{may be used for}} cutaneous <b>leishmaniasis.</b> Which treatments are effective depends on the strain, with topical paromomycin effective for L. major, L. tropica, L. mexicana, L. panamensis, and L. braziliensis. Pentamidine is effective for L. guyanensis. Oral fluconazole or itraconazole appears effective in L. major and L. tropica.|$|E
25|$|Incomplete {{treatment}} {{has been cited}} as a major reason of death from visceral <b>leishmaniasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The best {{treatment}} for cutaneous <b>leishmaniasis</b> is not known. Treatments {{that work for}} one species of leishmania may not work for another; {{it is recommended that}} advice of a tropical medicine or geographical medicine specialist be sought. Ideally, every effort should be made to establish the species of leishmania by molecular techniques (PCR) prior to starting treatment. In the setting of a developing country, there is often only one species present in a particular locality, so it is usually unnecessary to speciate every infection. Unfortunately, <b>leishmaniasis</b> is an orphan disease in developed nations, and almost all the current treatment options are toxic with significant side effects. The most sound {{treatment for}} cutaneous <b>leishmaniasis</b> thus far is prevention.|$|E
25|$|Mucocutaneous <b>leishmaniasis</b> causes both {{skin and}} mucosal ulcers with damage {{primarily}} {{of the nose}} and mouth.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} of <b>leishmaniasis</b> are skin sores which erupt weeks to {{months after the}} person is bitten by infected sand flies.|$|E
25|$|Leishmania donovani is {{a species}} of {{intracellular}} parasites belonging to the genus Leishmania, a group of haemoflagellate kinetoplastids that cause the disease <b>leishmaniasis.</b> It is a human blood parasite responsible for visceral <b>leishmaniasis</b> or kala-azar, the most severe form of <b>leishmaniasis.</b> It infects the mononuclear phagocyte system including spleen, liver and bone marrow. Infection is transmitted by species of sandfly belonging to the genus Phlebotomus in Old World and Lutzomyia in New World. Therefore, the parasite is prevalent throughout tropical and temperate regions including Africa (mostly in Sudan), China, India, Nepal, southern Europe, Russia and South America. It is responsible for thousands of deaths every year and has spread to 88 countries, with 350 million people at constant risk of infection and 0.5 million new cases in a year.|$|E
25|$|Response to {{infection}} by Leishmania donovani varies a great deal, {{not only by}} the strength but also by the type of the patient's immune reaction. People with a history of infection by strains of leishmania that cause visceral <b>leishmaniasis</b> show a continuum of immune responses from protective to non-protective. Those who acquired protective immunity (skin test positive) without ever having visceral <b>leishmaniasis</b> have a strong type 1 CD4+ response to leishmania antigens. Antigen specific interferon-gamma and proliferation, as well as the ability to kill intracellular leishmania, are hallmarks of protective immunity. Because visceral <b>leishmaniasis</b> patients lack these responses to leishmania and other antigens, they usually die of secondary infections if left untreated. In addition, increased interleukin-10 secretion is characteristic of the disease. Addition of interleukin-12, anti-interleukin-10, or anti-interleukin-4 to peripheral blood mononuclear cells from acute patients sometimes increases interferon-gamma secretion and proliferation. Acute patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells include CD8+ T regulatory cells that decrease interferon-gamma secretion and proliferation responses to leishmania and other antigens and increase interleukin-10 secretion when added to autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells harvested after successful treatment. Thus, the CD8+ T regulatory cells reproduce the immune response characteristic of visceral <b>leishmaniasis.</b> CD8+ T regulatory cells are also associated with post kala azar dermal <b>leishmaniasis.</b> Addition of interleukin-12 or interferon-gamma does not prevent CD8+ T regulatory activity. The dominance of type 1 CD4+ T cells in skin test positive adults maybe explained by their secretion of factors that inhibit and kill CD8+ T regulatory cells. Successfully treated patients rarely develop visceral <b>leishmaniasis</b> a second time. Their peripheral blood mononuclear cells show a mixed T1/T2 CD4+ and CD8+ T suppressor response but do have the ability to kill intracellular leishmania.|$|E
25|$|<b>Leishmaniasis</b> is {{a disease}} caused by parasites of the Leishmania type. It is spread by the bite of certain types of sandflies. The disease can present in three main ways: {{cutaneous}}, mucocutaneous, or visceral <b>leishmaniasis.</b> The cutaneous form presents with skin ulcers, while the mucocutaneous form presents with ulcers of the skin, mouth, and nose, and the visceral form starts with skin ulcers and then later presents with fever, low red blood cells, and enlarged spleen and liver.|$|E
25|$|Mishra's {{studies on}} Visceral <b>leishmaniasis</b> are {{considered}} by many as his most notable contribution. <b>Leishmaniasis,</b> the second largest parasitic killer after Malaria and known locally as Kala Azar, was a common disease in the area and, after extensive research funded by the World Health Organization, Dr. Mishra proposed the use of Amphotericin B (Fungizone) to combat the disease through an article he published in Lancet in 1991. The proposal {{is regarded as a}} pioneering one and the drug is the one most commonly used the world over to treat Kala Azar.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, 3,314 tonnes were {{produced}} for malaria control and visceral <b>leishmaniasis.</b> India {{is the only}} country still manufacturing DDT and is the largest consumer. China ceased production in 2007.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{the name}} {{kala-azar}} is used interchangeably with the scientific name visceral <b>leishmaniasis</b> {{for the most}} acute form of the disease caused by L. donovani. The disease is endemic in West Bengal, where it was first discovered, but is seen at its most deadly in north and east Africa. It {{can also be found}} throughout the Arab world and southern Europe (where the causative organism is L. infantum), and a slightly different strain of the pathogen, L. chagasi, is responsible for <b>leishmaniasis</b> in the new world. Several species of canines serve as reservoir hosts of L. infantum (chagasi).|$|E
25|$|The gold {{standard}} for diagnosis is visualization of the amastigotes in splenic aspirate or bone marrow aspirate. This is a technically challenging procedure that is frequently unavailable {{in areas of the}} world where visceral <b>leishmaniasis</b> is endemic.|$|E
25|$|<b>Leishmaniasis</b> is {{considered}} one of the classic causes of a markedly enlarged (and therefore palpable) spleen; the organ, which is not normally felt during examination of the abdomen, may even become larger than the liver in severe cases.|$|E
25|$|Serological {{testing is}} much more {{frequently}} used in areas where <b>leishmaniasis</b> is endemic. A 2014 Cochrane review evaluated different rapid diagnostic tests. One of them (the rK39 immunochromatographic test) gave correct, positive results in 92% of the people with visceral <b>leishmaniasis</b> and it gave correct, negative results in 92% {{of the people who}} did not have the disease. A second rapid test (called latex agglutination test) gave correct, positive results in 64% of the people with the disease and it gave correct, negative results in 93% of the people without the disease. Other types of tests have not been studied thoroughly enough to ascertain their efficacy.|$|E
25|$|For current funding statistics, human African trypanosomiasis is grouped with kinetoplastid infections. Kinetoplastids {{refer to}} a group of {{flagellate}} protozoa. Kinetoplastid infections include African sleeping sickness, Chagas' disease, and <b>Leishmaniasis.</b> All together, these three diseases accounted for 4.4 million disability adjusted life years (DALYs) and an additional 70,075 recorded deaths yearly. For kinetoplastid infections, the total global research and development funding was approximately $136.3 million in 2012. Each of the three diseases, African sleeping sickness, Chagas' disease, and <b>Leishmaniasis</b> each received approximately a third of the funding, which was about $36.8 million US dollars, $38.7 million US dollars, and $31.7 million US dollars, respectively.|$|E
25|$|For visceral <b>leishmaniasis</b> in India, South America, and the Mediterranean, {{liposomal}} amphotericin B is {{the recommended}} treatment {{and is often}} used as a single dose. Rates of cure with a single dose of amphotericin have been reported as 95%. In India, almost all infections are resistant to pentavalent antimonials. In Africa, a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin is recommended. These, however, can have significant side effects. Miltefosine, an oral medication, is effective against both visceral and cutaneous <b>leishmaniasis.</b> Side effects are generally mild, though it can cause birth defects if taken within 3 months of getting pregnant. It {{does not appear to}} work for L. major or L. braziliensis.|$|E
25|$|Visceral <b>leishmaniasis</b> or {{kala-azar}} ('black fever') is {{the most}} serious form, and is potentially fatal if untreated. Other consequences, which can occur a few months to years after infection, include fever, damage to the spleen and liver, and anemia.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} of choice for visceral <b>leishmaniasis</b> acquired in India is now Amphotericin B in its various liposomal preparations. In East Africa, the WHO recommended treatment is SSG (sodium stibogluconate and paromomycin) developed by Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi)in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Most {{species of}} Leishmania {{are capable of}} infecting humans and causing {{cutaneous}} <b>leishmaniasis.</b> In the New World, these organisms include L. amazonensis, L. braziliensis, L. guyanensis, L. lainsoni, L. lindenbergi, L. mexicana, L. naiffi, L. panamensis, L. peruviana, L. shawi, and L. venezuelensis. Old World species that cause cutaneous <b>leishmaniasis</b> include L. aethiopica, L. infantum, L. major, and L. tropica. With the exception of L. tropica — which is commonly associated with human settlements and therefore {{considered to be an}} anthroponotic species — all of these organisms are zoonotic. As demographic changes occur in developing nations, some species that have traditionally been considered to be zoonotic (e.g., L. panamensis) are becoming primarily human pathogens.|$|E
