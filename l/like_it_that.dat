25|$|Congregation Mezritch Synagogue – While not an {{individual}} landmark, this building was protected in 2010 {{as part of}} the East Village/Lower East Side Historic District. Due to its status as the area’s last operating neoclassical “tenement synagogue” — named for the fact that it fits miraculously into a narrow mid-block 22-foot wide lot — GVSHP in 2008 asked the LPC to designate it as {{an individual}} landmark. Although that did not happen, due to the broader designation, this historic building remains to represent the dozens <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> used to line the local streets.|$|E
500|$|In the 21st century, {{the song}} {{continued}} to draw commentary from listeners. [...] By now Kaukonen was offering {{the view that}} the [...] "blood-stained banders" [...] of the lyric was an allusion to the Ku Klux Klan. He continued to find meaning in performing [...] "Good Shepherd" [...] and other songs <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> celebrated religion in one context or another without preaching, saying such material gave him a doorway into scripture: [...] "I guess you could say I loved the Bible without even knowing it. The spiritual message is always uplifting – it's a good thing." ...|$|E

After recording the DVD, the band used a sprinkler system with diluted water rather than a bucket with blood that was like tar when recording the DVD. King later remarked, [...] "My guitar didn’t <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> <b>that</b> {{was the last time}} I played it," [...] and he donated it to the Hard Rock Cafe after the show. Vocalist Tom Araya felt the same and admitted; [...] "It was messy. I couldn't play because the initial dump {{at the beginning of the}} song got all over me. I couldn't hold my pick. I was slapping my bass trying to get sound out of it." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{composing}} {{tracks for}} Meet Miley Cyrus, Cyrus was originally very apprehensive {{in regards to}} adding [...] "See You Again" [...] to the album. [...] "I'm not sure about this song. I don't think I {{want to put it}} on the album. I don't really <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> much. It's just O.K.", she said. However, she was convinced to record it and, once she listened to the finished product, she changed her mind. She thought it was odd, but in a positive light, and decided to include it on her debut album. Cyrus says [...] "See You Again" [...] is a dance song with a special meaning to her. The song was remixed by Rock Mafia for the release of Cyrus' second studio album Breakout (2008).|$|E
500|$|In {{his paper}} [...] "On certain arithmetical functions", Ramanujan defined the {{so-called}} delta-function whose coefficients are called [...] (the Ramanujan tau function). He proved many congruences for these numbers such as [...] for primes [...] This congruence (and others <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> Ramanujan proved) inspired Jean-Pierre Serre (1954 Fields Medalist) to conjecture {{that there is}} a theory of Galois representations which [...] "explains" [...] these congruences [...] and more generally all modular forms. [...] is the first example of a modular form to be studied in this way. Pierre Deligne (in his Fields Medal-winning work) proved Serre's conjecture. The proof of Fermat's Last Theorem proceeds by first reinterpreting elliptic curves and modular forms in terms of these Galois representations. Without this theory there would be no proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.|$|E
500|$|The {{historian}} of food Bee Wilson, rereading [...] "this endearing work" [...] 58 years on for The Guardian, wrote {{that she had}} remembered it as a history book and an epic account of English cooking, [...] "interspersed with recipes." [...] She was therefore [...] "startled" [...] to find that almost {{the whole of the}} text is [...] "taken up with practical recipes and techniques, with very little historical narrative." [...] Wilson finds the book as Hartley explicitly intended, an untidy kitchen, [...] "a warm friendly place". For Hartley, writes Wilson, [...] "the past is not a foreign country", but ever-present. She notes that Hartley [...] "announces dogmatically" [...] that English cooking is old-fashioned [...] "because we <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way." [...] Wilson finds [...] "Hartley's devotion to archaic recipes such as stargazey pie and posset ... mildly crazed." [...] But whether mad or not, Hartley [...] "approaches the cuisine of the past with the humour and sharpness of a journalist." ...|$|E

500|$|Dunn {{trained and}} rode his first World Grand Championship {{on the bay}} {{stallion}} Dark Spirit's Rebel. In 1991, the horse placed third in the competition. In 1992, the horse and rider pair won at most of the shows they had entered, including the World Grand Championship at that year's Celebration. Dunn had been training for 42 years at the time, and was 74 years old, making him the oldest trainer ever to win the class. The competition was held {{in front of a}} record crowd of 28,000. [...] "Rebel" [...] was the favorite horse going into the competition, out of a field of 13, and the team of Dunn and the stallion was described by the Florence TimesDaily as the [...] "most popular team in Celebration history". Dunn said after the win, [...] "I've been coming to the Celebration since 1950 and I've never seen anything <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> <b>That</b> made it twice as good. It's nice to know that I've got that many friends and supporters." [...] The following year, Dark Spirit's Rebel was retired from competition in a formal ceremony at the Celebration. Dunn's riding number, 1865, was also retired.|$|E
500|$|In a {{positive}} review published in Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, describing Spectre as [...] "party time for Bond fans, a fierce, funny, gorgeously produced valentine to the longest-running franchise in movies". Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle, raved that [...] "One {{of the great}} satisfactions of Spectre is that, {{in addition to all}} the stirring action, and all the timely references to a secret organization out to steal everyone's personal information, we get to believe in Bond as a person." [...] Stephen Whitty from The New York Daily News, who awarded the film four of five stars, stated that [...] "Craig is cruelly efficient. Dave Bautista makes a good, Oddjob-like assassin. And while Lea Seydoux doesn't leave a huge impression as this film's 'Bond girl', perhaps it's because we've already met—far too briefly—the hypnotic Monica Bellucci, as the first real 'Bond woman' since Diana Rigg." [...] Chicago Sun-Times film reviewer Richard Roeper, who gave the film three stars out of four, considered the film [...] "solidly {{in the middle of the}} all-time rankings, which means it's still a slick, beautifully photographed, action-packed, international thriller with a number of wonderfully, ludicrously entertaining set pieces, a sprinkling of dry wit, myriad gorgeous women and a classic psycho-villain who is clearly out of his mind but seems to <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way." [...] Michael Phillips, reviewing for the Chicago Tribune, stated, [...] "For all its workmanlike devotion to out-of-control helicopters, Spectre works best when everyone's on the ground, doing his or her job, driving expensive fast cars heedlessly, detonating the occasional wisecrack, enjoying themselves and their beautiful clothes." [...] Variety film critic Guy Lodge complained in his review that [...] "What's missing is the unexpected emotional urgency of Skyfall, as the film sustains its predecessor's nostalgia kick with a less sentimental bent." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jagger {{continues}} in the Rolling Stone interview {{when asked about the}} song's resonance thirty years on; [...] "I don't know if it [...] I don't know whether we should really play it. I was persuaded to put it [...] because it seemed to fit in, but I'm not sure if it really has any resonance for the present day. I don't really <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> much." [...] Despite this, the song has been performed on a majority of the Stones' tours since its introduction to their canon of work.|$|E

[...] Pet Sounds was released on May 16, debuting on the Billboard charts at 106. Compared to their previous albums in the US, Pet Sounds achieved dramatically less commercial success; it peaked at No. 10 on the Billboard LP chart, with sales estimated at around 500,000 units. Pet Sounds initial release was not awarded gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In February 2000, Pet Sounds was presented with gold and platinum awards based on sales that could be documented, although Capitol Records estimated it may have sold over two million copies.|$|E
2500|$|According to a {{statement}} in the early 1990s by {{a close friend of}} Caserta and Joplin's, Caserta's book angered the Los Angeles heroin dealer she described in detail, including the make and model of his car, for her book. [...] According to Ellis Amburn, in 1973 a [...] "carful of dope dealers" [...] visited a Los Angeles lesbian bar Caserta had been frequenting since Joplin was alive. Amburn quoted Caserta's friend Kim Chappell, who was in the alley behind the bar: [...] "I was stabbed because, when Peggy's book came out, her dealer, the same one who'd given Janis her last fix, didn't <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> he was referred to and was out to get Peggy. He couldn't find her, so he went for her lover. When they realized who I was, they felt that my death would also hit Peggy, and so they stabbed me." [...] Despite being [...] "stabbed three times in the chest, puncturing both lungs," [...] Chappell eventually recovered.|$|E

[...] In a subsequent editorial the newspaper applauded U.Va's decision to resist the demand and highlighted the potential cost of the precedent being set by Cuccinelli, noting that [...] "if researchers at state institutions are unwilling to stick their necks out in case a state official dislikes their findings, scientific progress at the commonwealth's universities will screech to a halt, talented faculty will leave, and the best and brightest students will go elsewhere." ...|$|E
