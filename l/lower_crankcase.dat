5|$|The Straight Eight was {{the first}} car in series {{production}} in the United States with a straight-eight engine. The engine had a cast iron block, a detachable cast iron cylinder head, and an aluminum <b>lower</b> <b>crankcase</b> and oil pan. The crankshaft ran in three main bearings. While the prototype Straight Eight shown at the model's introduction had horizontal valves of the type used in earlier Duesenberg-designed marine and racing engines, the model that entered production had a shaft-driven single overhead camshaft which used rockers to operate two valves per cylinder in a hemispheric combustion chamber.|$|E
500|$|Later {{production}} R engines featured sodium-filled {{exhaust valve}} stems for improved cooling, while additional modifications included a redesigned <b>lower</b> <b>crankcase</b> casting {{and the introduction}} of an oil scraper ring below the piston gudgeon pin; a measure that was carried over to the Merlin engine. A balanced crankshaft was introduced in May 1931, and the compression ratio on the [...] "sprint" [...] engines prepared for that year was raised from 6:1 to 7:1.|$|E

25|$|Aluminium-alloy casting {{fitted to}} rear of crankcase. Carries the supercharger; and houses drives to the supercharger, {{auxiliary}} gearbox coupling, engine speed indicator, airscrew constant-speed unit, intercooler pump and fuel pump, {{as well as}} the oil and coolant pumps in the <b>lower</b> half <b>crankcase.</b>|$|R
50|$|The U.S. Navy {{badly needed}} light, {{reliable}} engines for its carrierborne aircraft. As {{a means of}} pressuring Wright and other companies into developing radial engines, it gave a contract to Lawrance for 200 of the J-1 radial and ceased buying the liquid-cooled Wright-Hispano engines. At the urging of the Army and Navy the Wright Aeronautical Corporation bought the Lawrance Company, and subsequent engines were known as Wright radials. The Wright Whirlwind had essentially the same <b>lower</b> end (<b>crankcase,</b> cam, and crankshaft) as the J-1.|$|R
2500|$|Fiat's {{interest}} in Diesel engines dated from 1907, initially focused on slow turning factory engines then moving to higher speed marine and railway motors. [...] The AN.1 {{was their first}} foray into Diesel aero-engines. To shorten its development time and {{to concentrate on the}} higher combustion chamber pressures, different burning temperatures and fuel supply systems of the Diesel cycle, they based its design on the Fiat A.12. [...] This was a petrol engine first run in 1916 and produced in large numbers during World War I, a water-cooled, upright, overhead camshaft straight six. The AN.1 kept the external dimensions and the <b>lower</b> section, crankshaft, <b>crankcase,</b> sump, plus the lubrication and water-cooling supplies of the older engine but required new cylinders, pistons, valve gear and fuel delivery systems to replace carburettors and magnetos. The cylinder barrels had to be stronger to withstand the greater combustion pressures (2-300 atmospheres) required by the compression ignition Diesel. The swept volume of the Diesel engine was reduced by 23.4% as the cylinders had a bore of 140mm (5.51in), compared with the A.12's 160mm (6.30in). Two camshafts were fitted to operate the four valves per cylinder, though they were driven via the same tall vertical rod used for the single camshaft of the A.12, at its top, and the water pump of both models at its bottom.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinder}} block is an open-deck, midi-skirt die-cast aluminium type with cast-in iron liners and a die-cast aluminium <b>lower</b> <b>crankcase</b> and a stamped oil pan. The forged steel crankshaft is fully balanced with eight counterweights {{and supported by}} five main bearings. A helical gear pressed in No. 3 counterweight drives twin contra-rotating balance shafts in the shaft housing within the <b>lower</b> <b>crankcase.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Letov Š-22's {{designer}} Alois Šmolik briefly interrupted {{his series}} of biplane fighters with this Dewoitine-influenced parasol-wing monoplane. It was {{powered by a}} [...] Škoda L W-12 water-cooled engine, with three banks of four cylinders, driving a two-blade propeller. [...] This engine was a Škoda version of the Hispano-Suiza 12Gb, with a new <b>lower</b> <b>crankcase.</b> The Š-22 was an all-metal design.|$|E
5000|$|Capable of {{producing}} [...] {{out of its}} 4565 cc displacement, the Northstar featured a cast aluminum 90° V8 block with 102 mm (4 in) bore spacing split into unitary upper and lower halves. The <b>lower</b> <b>crankcase</b> assembly supported the crankshaft without conventional main bearing caps. An oil manifold plate with an integrated silicone gasket forms the oil gallery under this. A typical oil change used 7.5-8 quarts of oil.|$|E
50|$|The {{crankcase}} of the OM 138 {{consists of}} two parts, the lower part with {{the lower part of}} the crankshaft bearing and the upper part with the cylinder block and the camshaft. The lower and upper crankcase parts are connected with pin screws on the horizontal crankshaft center. The <b>lower</b> <b>crankcase</b> part is strengthened with ribs and made of a light metal alloy. The flange of the gearbox is cast onto the <b>lower</b> <b>crankcase</b> part. The upper crankcase part is made of grey cast iron, it reaches from the crankshaft to the cylinder head. On it′s front, the upper crankcase part has a bulge that holds the camshaft, so that the camshaft can be driven by the crankshaft using only two gears. The camshaft is supported in five bearings. For camshaft maintenance, the bulge on the crankcase front has a removable cover. Mountings for the starter motor, the alternator and the injection pump are also cast onto the crankcase. For the lubrication of the crank- and camshaft, the crankcase has an oil pipe drilled into.|$|E

5000|$|It has {{a number}} of {{improvements}} over the previous generation of Ford diesel engines, including the electronically controlled fuel injection pump otherwise known as [...] "fly-by-wire" [...] In addition, the traditional oil sump is replaced with a cast aluminium <b>lower</b> <b>crankcase</b> and a shallow oil pan; there is an oil-to-water cooler, and a great many detail improvements to parts throughout. The engine has been a noted good performer and is a smoother, more powerful unit than the one it replaced.|$|E
50|$|The V12 model {{featured}} an all new 4480 cc 60 degree V12 engine {{designed by}} W. O. Bentley. The engine has a combined cylinder block and upper crancase cast in iron {{with a light}} alloy <b>lower</b> <b>crankcase.</b> The cylinder heads are in cast iron. Each bank of six cylinders has its own single overhead camshaft, chain driven, and its own distributor driven {{from the back of}} the camshaft. Twin downdraught SU carburettors are located between the engine blocks. 180 bhp is developed at 5000rpm.|$|E

50|$|Cars were {{required}} to be designed with a separate wastegate for exhaust gases to pass through {{in a bid to}} increase the noise of the cars following criticism since the introduction of the 2014 generation of engines. The FIA also opted {{to increase the number of}} tokens available for power unit development starting in 2016. While the initial plans would have given manufacturers fifteen tokens for the season, the number was raised to thirty-two, the same number as 2014, in order to allow struggling manufacturers such as Renault and Honda to improve their development. This decision also allowed further development on parts that were initially planned to be closed off, including the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>crankcase,</b> valve drive, crankshaft, air-valve system and ancillaries drive.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} parts the Italian collector assembled for 2459 {{were mostly}} engine parts, unfortunately he couldn't find a type 61 engine {{or any other}} parts from 2459 so he substituted a type 60 engine of a different capacity, and included an original cylinder head, <b>lower</b> <b>crankcase</b> and sump, cam covers, and transaxle tower (also known as a differential case), which included the cast numbers for the original birdcage parts used to verify the parts as original type 60. Frank Tralli of Modena, Italy rebuilt the engine to original birdcage specifications from both these original parts and other parts manufactured according to the original drawings. He then Dyno'd the engine for racing {{which can be found}} in the Maserati Tipo 61-2459 Dyno Report.|$|E
50|$|The {{frame of}} the RD500LC is {{manufactured}} from mild steel box-section and uses a perimeter layout. The rear shock absorber is unusually placed horizontally under the engine and uses the <b>lower</b> <b>crankcase</b> as a mounting point. The under-seat area is occupied by the upper cylinder exhaust chambers, the oil pump and one-way valves, the battery and the YPVS (Yamaha Power Valve System) servo motor. The battery is of the 'wet' lead acid type and a cut-out is provided in the right side panel to view the acid levels without having to dismantle half the bike!The rear of the shock absorber connects to an extruded aluminium alloy swinging arm via several forged aluminium rocker arms. An unusually small diameter 16-inch wheel is held between 37 mm spring and oil damped forks which featured adjustable anti-dive units.|$|E
50|$|Instead, if {{the engine}} is rigidly mounted to the frame, {{vibrations}} pass to and are dissipated via the whole frame, and the rider. Rigid mounting allows the engine {{to contribute to the}} overall stiffness of the frame. It also becomes possible to mount the swingarm directly to the engine rather than the frame, avoiding the need for frame members extending downward to the swingarm pivot. By increasing the number of mounting points between the engine and frame, vibrations and stress can be better dissipated in the frame, typically creating a triangle between the swingarm in the rear, the cylinder head at the top and the <b>lower</b> <b>crankcase</b> area at the front. If a rigidly mounted engine not only contributes to, but is critical to, the stiffness of the frame, and {{is an integral part of}} closing the triangle or trellis structure that transfers force from the headstock to the swingarm, to the point that without the engine the frame would be deformed, {{the engine is}} called a stressed member, or a lifted engine. Sharing the load between the engine and frame reduces the overall weight of the motorcycle.|$|E
