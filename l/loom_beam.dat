50|$|Nomads usually use a {{horizontal}} loom. In its simplest form, two <b>loom</b> <b>beams</b> are fastened, and kept apart by stakes which are {{driven into the}} ground. The tension of the warps is maintained by driving wedges between the <b>loom</b> <b>beams</b> and the stakes. If the nomad journey goes on, the stakes are pulled out, and the unfinished rug is rolled up on the beams. The size of the <b>loom</b> <b>beams</b> {{is limited by the}} need to be easily transportable, thus, genuine nomad rugs are often small in size. In Persia, <b>loom</b> <b>beams</b> were mostly made of poplar, because poplar is the only tree which is easily available and straight. The closer the warps are spanned, the more dense the rug can be woven. The width of a rug is always determined by the length of the <b>loom</b> <b>beams.</b> Weaving starts {{at the lower end of}} the loom, and proceeds towards the upper end.|$|R
25|$|The {{technically}} more advanced, stationary vertical looms {{are used}} in villages and town manufactures. The more advanced types of vertical looms are more comfortable, as they allow for the weavers to retain their position throughout the entire weaving process. The Tabriz type of vertical loom allows for weaving of carpets up to double {{the length of the}} loom, while there is no limit to the length of the carpet that can be woven on a vertical roller <b>beam</b> <b>loom.</b> In essence, the width of the carpet is limited by the length of the <b>loom</b> <b>beams.</b>|$|R

In essence, {{the width of the}} carpet is limited by the length of the <b>loom</b> <b>beams.</b> While the dimensions of a horizontal loom define the maximum size of the rug which can be woven on it, on a vertical loom longer carpets can be woven, as the completed sections of the rugs can be moved {{to the back of the}} loom, or rolled up on a beam, as the weaving proceeds.|$|R
50|$|The <b>loomed</b> weavers <b>beam</b> {{is taken}} into the weaving shed, where it gaited to the loom by a tackler. One weaver would tenter 6, or 8 Lancashire Looms, which would be kept working by a tackler. Nine hundred looms Harling & Todd of Burnley, Lancashire looms of this period {{required}} 250 weavers and 9 tacklers.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>loomed</b> weavers <b>beam</b> {{was taken}} into the weaving shed, where a weaver would tenter four Lancashire Looms working at 220 picks per minute. The beam was gaited to the loom and kept working by a tackler who tentered 130. With the More Looms system brought in after the second war, weavers tentered ten looms, but the tackler had a set of 70.|$|R
50|$|The <b>loomed</b> weavers <b>beam</b> {{would be}} taken into the weaving shed. One weaver would tenter 6, or 8 Lancashire Looms, which would be kept working by a tackler. Today there are 308 looms from 1894 built by Pemberton, or Harling & Todd of Burnley. These would require 65-80 weavers and 3 tacklers. At its peak there were 990 looms, all driven by {{overhead}} line shafts.|$|R
25|$|The roller <b>beam</b> <b>loom</b> is used {{in larger}} Turkish manufactures, but {{is also found in}} Persia and India. It {{consists}} of two movable beams to which the warps are attached. Both beams are fitted with ratchets or similar locking devices. Once a section of the carpet is completed, is rolled on to the lower beam. On a roller <b>beam</b> <b>loom,</b> any length of carpet can be produced. In some areas of Turkey several rugs are woven in series on the same warps, and separated from each other by cutting the warps after the weaving is finished.|$|R
25|$|There {{are three}} general types of {{vertical}} looms, {{all of which}} can be modified in a number of ways: the fixed village loom, the Tabriz or Bunyan loom, and the roller <b>beam</b> <b>loom.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Ceade millia diaoul, hundred {{thousand}} devils!" [...] exclaimed Rob, rising and striding through the hut, [...] "My sons weavers!--Millia molligheart!--but I wad see every <b>loom</b> in Glasgow, <b>beam,</b> traddles, and shuttles, burnt in hell-fire sooner!" ...|$|R
50|$|When yarn {{enters a}} weaving mill, the warp is usually already on a beam and the weft is on {{different}} size cops and cheeses. The weft {{has to be}} wound onto pirns to fit in the shuttles suitable for installed <b>looms.</b> The <b>beam</b> with 2000 or more ends {{is placed in the}} Cylinder Tape Sizing Machine. The threads pass through the size to stiffen them and reduce friction. The size is a mixture of flour soft soap and tallow. The ends are dried over steam-heated cylinders and wound onto the final beam, the weavers beam.|$|R
5000|$|He {{turned to}} {{directing}} television {{when there was}} less need for low-budget movies {{to serve as the}} second half of a double feature. His skills were perfect for TV. In 1950 his TV career began with directing The Jack Benny Program, on which he was played several times by actor Ross Elliott. Other programs he directed include The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show, The Bob Cummings Show, The George Gobel Program, December Bride, Leave It to Beaver, My Three Sons (108 episodes), and The Smothers Brothers Show. He directed and/or produced more than 500 TV series or segments. He produced The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson starting in 1970. using the name Fred de Cordova. [...] He became producer of the show in 1970 and executive producer in 1984. He described his job as “..chief traffic cop, talent scout, No. 1 fan and critic all rolled into one" [...] in a 1981 interview. de Cordova was described as “.. a large, <b>looming,</b> <b>beaming</b> man with horn-rimmed glasses, an Acapulcan tan, and an engulfing handshake that is a contract in itself, complete with small print and an option for renewal on both sides.” He was executive producer when the final Carson Tonight Show signed off on May 22, 1992. He won five Emmys for his work on the show.|$|R
2500|$|The era of Industrial Revolution weaving {{machinery}} {{gave rise}} to technological jargon {{in places such as}} Yorkshire with a strong local dialect. [...] The resultant inscrutability of linguistic terms has given rise to such jokes as the one from Monty Python's Trouble at Mill sketch: One on't cross beams gone owt askew on treadle. This nonsense may have been written so on the script as a joke, but what Graham Chapman could have said correctly in dialect is, [...] "One o't crossbeams 'as gone out o' skew on't treadle", meaning [...] "One of the crossbeams has gone askew on the treadle". The treadle was a rocking pedal, powered by the worker's foot. [...] The treadle in turn powered a reciprocating beam, and the power from that was transferred to the machinery. On a <b>loom,</b> these reciprocating <b>beams</b> were called lams, and were connected with the treadles by strings which were also connected with jacks to work the yelds. [...] In big factories, power could be transferred from one large drive wheel to another across a wide room via a reciprocating beam, called in that situation a crossbeam. Out of skew is a dialect expression meaning in incorrect position. Whether a foot-driven treadle could power a mighty crossbeam is a moot point, and may be a joke in itself, but the explanation of the above phrase and its humour is tightly connected with the mechanism of the weaving machinery described below.|$|R
