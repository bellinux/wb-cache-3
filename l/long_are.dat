25|$|The holotype fossil {{consists}} only of {{the front}} part of the head, which is kept today under the number USP GP/2T-5 in the University of São Paulo. It is characterized particularly by its unusual length and curved lip region, which is strongly compressed laterally. The overall length of the complete head is estimated at approximately 84 centimeters. In the premaxilla, a broken-off tooth with partial tooth crown was recovered. The strongly extended and straight teeth with conical tooth crowns, which are 6 to 40 millimeters <b>long,</b> <b>are</b> singly embedded. This indicates continuous tooth replacement where new teeth were pushed up between the old ones. Judging by the tooth sockets, altogether the premaxilla had seven teeth; the third tooth was the largest.|$|E

The fruit bodies have convex brownish caps up to [...] in diameter, supported by solid yellowish to reddish stems measuring [...] long by [...] thick.

The underside of the caps bears the fertile, spore-making tissue called the hymenium, which typically has shallow, crowded wrinkles or veins that are roughly the same color or paler than the top surface. Some variation in color has been observed depending on the collection location. For example, specimens found in Alaska {{are more likely to be}} jet-black in color with a dark gray underside.|$|E
