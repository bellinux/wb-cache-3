40|$|Operations, {{and other}} members of your staff. The {{inspection}} examined activities conducted under your license as they relate to safety and compliance with the Commission’s rules and regulations and with the conditions of your license. The inspectors reviewed selected procedures and records, observed activities, and interviewed personnel. As described in Section 1 R 19 of this report, the NRC concluded that the failure to establish adequate procedural controls for the maintenance of electrical connections on diesel generators led to the failure of Diesel Generator 2 during testing on January 15, 2008. The safety significance of this finding was assessed {{on the basis of the}} best available information, including influential assumptions, using the applicable Significance Determination Process and was preliminarily determined to be a White (low to moderate safety significance) finding. Attachment 2 of this report provides a detailed description of the preliminary risk assessment. In accordance with NRC Inspection Manual Chapter 0609, “Significance Determination Process, ” we intend to complete our evaluation using the best available information and issue our final determination of safety significance within 90 days of this letter. This finding does not represent an immediate safety concern because of the corrective actions you have taken. These actions included applying thread <b>locking</b> <b>compound</b> to the amphenol connections on both diesel generators. Also, this finding constitutes an apparent violation of NRC requirements and is being considered for escalated enforcement action in accordance with the NRC Enforcement Policy.

40|$|The {{motivation}} {{of this research}} is to explore the viability of a method to directly verify whether or not an anaerobic adhesive within a threaded fastener assembly has cured sufficiently to provide secondary locking. Direct verification was implemented via the application of a test torque in the loosening direction of a fastener assembly with Loctite (given a 24 hour cure time). A three phase test plan was developed with the intent of identifying and utilizing this verification torque value which is unique to a given fastener assembly. It was proved that the direct verification method, as outlined in the test plan, was in fact a valid method of verification in some cases. Results were dependent on the materials and coatings of the fastener assemblies. The curing properties of the liquid <b>locking</b> <b>compound</b> (LLC) with plain steel specimens resulted in a verification test that could accurately predict sufficient locking and cure (using distributions in torque measurements). Tests with zinc coated and stainless steel specimens, however, did not produce the same level of predictability in cure as the plain steel specimens. The direct verification method as defined herein is not suited to certain materials and coatings. The less predictable curing properties of the stainless steel specimens caused complications in determining a verification torque that could reliably determine cure, resulting in dropping stainless steel from static and dynamic testing. The zinc coated specimen data was more consistent, but the adhesive did not add sufficient breakaway strength to the fastener assembly needed to define a usable verification value. These results led {{to the conclusion that the}} direct verification method as presented in this work is limited to more active material selections. One possibility to improve the secondary locking of less active materials is the use of a higher strength adhesive. Testing to observe the effect of application of verification torque on the secondary locking was also performed. Multiple verifications were found to be destructive to the point that just over a third of samples failed that might have otherwise passed a single verification test. The single verification testing, on the other hand, caused substantially less locking mechanism degradation, leading to the use of a single verification torque in further testing...|$|E

The primary locking method is the fastener preload, with the application of the Loctite compound which when cured is intended to resist preload reduction. The reliability of these compounds has been questioned due to a number of failures during ground testing. The ISS Program Manager requested the NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) to characterize and quantify sensitivities of Loctite being used as a secondary locking feature.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Members of {{the green}} {{fluorescent}} protein (GFP) family form chromophores by modifications of three internal amino acid residues. Previously, many key character-istics of chromophores were studied using model compounds. However, no studies of intermolecular excited-state proton transfer (ESPT) with GFP-like synthetic chromophores have been performed because they either are nonfluorescent or lack an ionizable OH group. In this paper we report the synthesis and photochemical study of two highly fluorescent GFP chromophore analogues: p-HOBDI-BF 2 and p-HOPyDI:Zn. Among known fluorescent compounds, p-HOBDI-BF 2 is the closest analogue of the native GFP chromophore. These irrreversibly (p-HOBDI-BF 2) and reversibly (p-HOPyDI:Zn) <b>locked</b> <b>compounds</b> are the first examples of fully planar GFP chromophores, in which photoisomerization-induced deactivation is suppressed and protolytic photodissociation is observed. The photophysical behavior of p-HOBDI-BF 2 and p-HOPyDI:Zn (excited state pKa’s, solvatochromism, kinetics, and thermodynamics of proton transfer) reveals their high photoacidity, which makes them good models of intermolecular ESPT in fluorescent proteins. Moreover, p-HOPyDI:Zn is a first example of “super...|$|R
40|$|Communicated by A. T. Winfree We report {{observations}} of the tip motion of spiral waves in excitable Belousov-Zhabotinskii reagent. An open reactor is {{used to determine the}} time-asymptotic dynamics of the spiral tip as a function of a control parameter. We have observed a supercritical transition from simple rotation (one frequency) to compound rotation (two frequencies); the compound motion at onset closely resembles that predicted by two-species reaction-diffusion models. Measurements of the frequencies of the motion indicate that the compound rotation is quasiperiodic over the range studied; {{there is no evidence of}} frequency <b>locking.</b> The <b>compound</b> tip motion appears to result from fluctuations in the curvature of the spiral wave near its tip. We describe qualitatively the sequence of events during a single tip orbit and suggest that the refractory tail of the wave plays a dominant role in controlling the tip motion. 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe electro-hydrostatic {{actuator}} (EHA) {{is a kind}} of power-by-wire (PBW) actuator {{that converts}} the electrical power into localized hydraulic power for flight control. By removing the central hydraulic power supply together with hydraulic pipes, an EHA's reliability and efficiency are greatly improved but its frequency width and stiffness decreased. To overcome the drawback, this article proposes a novel structure of EHA associated with a power regulator. Composed of a high-pressure accumulator and a proportional valve, it can store and harness the hydraulic power flexibly according to the changing control requirements. The concept of transferred volume is put forward to estimate the capability of the power regulator. The actuator output position can be kept fixed with a hydraulic <b>lock.</b> The <b>compounded</b> control is specially developed to ensure the actuator system to operate in a correct manner. The simulation results indicate that the new-brand actuator results in efficient expanding of the system frequency width with an optimal power supply...|$|R

40|$|Phase I: The use of {{adhesive}} locking features or liquid <b>locking</b> <b>compounds</b> (LLCs) (e. g., Loctite) as a {{means of}} providing a secondary locking feature has been used on NASA programs since the Apollo program. In many cases Loctite was used as a last resort when (a) self-locking fasteners were no longer functioning per their respective drawing specification, (b) access was limited for removal & replacement, or (c) replacement could not be accomplished without severe impact to schedule. Long-term use of Loctite became inevitable in cases where removal and replacement of worn hardware was not cost effective and Loctite was assumed to be fully cured and working. The NASA Engineering & Safety Center (NESC) and United Space Alliance (USA) recognized the need for more extensive testing of Loctite grades to better understand their capabilities and limitations as a secondary locking feature. These tests, identified as Phase I, were designed to identify processing sensitivities, to determine proper cure time, the correct primer to use on aerospace nutplate, insert and bolt materials such as A 286 and MP 35 N, and the minimum amount of Loctite that is required to achieve optimum breakaway torque values. The. 1900 - 32 was the fastener size tested, due to wide usage in the aerospace industry. Three different grades of Loctite were tested. Results indicate that, with proper controls, adhesive locking features can be successfully used in the repair of locking features and should be considered for design. Phase II: Threaded fastening systems used in aerospace programs typically have a requirement for a redundant locking feature. The primary locking method is the fastener preload and the traditional redundant locking feature is a self-locking mechanical device that may include deformed threads, non-metallic inserts, split beam features, or other methods that impede movement between threaded members. The self-locking resistance of traditional locking features can be directly verified during assembly by measuring the dynamic prevailing torque. Adhesive locking features or LLCs are another method of providing redundant locking, but a direct verification method has not been used in aerospace applications to verify proper installation when using LLCs because of concern for damage to the adhesive bond. The reliability of LLCs has also been questioned due to failures observed during testing with coupons for process verification, although the coupon failures have often been attributed to a lack of proper procedures. It is highly desirable to have a direct method of verifying the LLC cure or bond integrity. The purpose of the Phase II test program was to determine if the torque applied during direct verification of an adhesive locking feature degrades that locking feature. This report documents the test program used to investigate the viability of such a direct verification method. Results of the Phase II testing were positive, and additional investigation of direct verification of adhesive locking features is merited...|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{modification}} of wood outlined {{in this thesis}} was carried out using Furfuryl alcohol and Acrylic resin. This thesis focused on impregnation of wood polymer composites (WPC) by chemical formulations that polymerise within the wood structure. A second investigation {{was based on the}} treatment of the wood with trimethyl borate (TMB) and attempts to immobilise it within the wood structure to extend the distribution of boric acid through the wood. Radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) was the starting material from which WPC were made, and impregnation chemicals were TMB, furfuryl alcohol monomer, prepolymerised acrylic resin and combinations of both resins. The effect of catalysts was also investigated. Much of the work was aimed at enhancing retention of tri-methyl borate (TMB) in wood by designing the system that would <b>lock</b> boron based <b>compounds</b> within the wood. TMB was applied separately and in combination with resin formulations. The expected penetration pathway was via capillaries, pits and voids. It is postulated that after vapour diffusion of TMB into wood, TMB would hydrolyse and boric acid, the product of hydrolysis, would be deposited in the cell wall. Further, it was proposed that resin treatment would encapsulate boric acid within the cell wall during polymerisation and consequently reduce or eliminate leaching. To further improve the chances of success, momentary immersion treatment of radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) with TMB in methanol and TMB in acrylic solution was also investigated. The result indicated that a greater penetration of TMB preservative would be achieved when it is applied with an acrylic solution than with methanol. From the statistical analysis, it was evident that in both cases, TMB in acrylic and TMB in methanol, TMB penetration was dependent on solution retention. In the latter case, solution retention increases with an increase in the proportion of acrylic in the solution. However, the penetration of TMB decreased as the solution viscosity increased and the penetration of TMB decreased as the concentration of methanol increased. Preservative penetration and retention were influenced by TMB concentration in both methanol and acrylic solutions. About 20 % TMB was needed in an acrylic solution to penetrate about 85 % of the area. In contrast, methanol solution containing 20 % TMB penetrated only 60 % of the area.
