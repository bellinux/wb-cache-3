25|$|A garden door {{resembles a}} French window (with <b>lites),</b> but is more secure because only one door is operable. The hinge of the {{operating}} door is next to the adjacent fixed door and the latch {{is located at the}} wall opening jamb rather than between the two doors or with the use of an espagnolette bolt.|$|E
25|$|From early on, the Hurd was {{developed}} to use GNU Mach as the microkernel. This was a technical decision made by Richard Stallman, who thought it would speed up the work by saving {{a large part of}} it. He has admitted that he was wrong about that. Other Unix-like systems working on the Mach microkernel include OSF/1, <b>Lites,</b> and MkLinux. macOS and NeXTSTEP use hybrid kernels based on Mach.|$|E
25|$|French {{doors are}} derived from an {{original}} French design called the casement door. It is a door with <b>lites</b> where all or some panels {{would be in a}} casement door. A French door traditionally has a moulded panel {{at the bottom of the}} door. It is called a French window when used in a pair as double-leaved doors with large glass panels in each door leaf, and in which the doors may swing out (typically) as well as in.|$|E

25|$|The Supercross season {{takes place}} during the winter and spring months, with races in a {{different}} city every weekend. There are 17 races in the 2011 and 2012 Monster Energy AMA/FIM Supercross schedule. The Supercross <b>Lites</b> riders series is split into two series—the East and the West Coast. The Supercross class has one large series where they travel {{from east to west}} for the race and even go to Canada for a couple rounds. Racers only get a month or two off out of the year between the Supercross and the motocross series.|$|E
25|$|A French door {{consists}} of a frame around one or more transparent or translucent panels (called lights or <b>lites)</b> that may be installed singly, in matching pairs, or even as series. A matching pair of these doors is called a French window, as it resembles a door-height casement window. When a pair of French doors {{is used as a}} French window, the application does not generally include a central mullion (as do some casement window pairs), thus allowing a wider unobstructed opening. The frame typically requires a weather strip at floor level and where the doors meet to prevent water ingress. An espagnolette bolt may allow the head and foot of each door to be secured in one movement. The slender window joinery maximizes light into the room and minimizes the visual impact of the doorway joinery when considered externally. The doors of a French window often open outward onto a balcony, porch, or terrace and they may provide an entrance to a garden.|$|E
25|$|As the new owner, Gaglardi's {{first move}} was {{bringing}} back former Stars President Jim <b>Lites</b> {{to once again}} take the reins as team president and CEO. To begin the 2011–12 season, the Stars once again jumped out to a fast start, going 22–15–1 through the first 38 games of the season. When {{the second half of}} the season began, however, the Stars slumped through the months of January and February, before getting hot again in late February. Throughout March, the Stars regained the lead of the Pacific Division. Beginning on March 26, 2012, the Stars embarked on a western road trip that saw them visit the Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers, Vancouver Canucks and San Jose Sharks. Going into the road trip, the Stars were in control of their own destiny, having to gain four points on the road trip to win their first Pacific Division title since the 2005–06 season. After the Stars lost 5–4 in Calgary to the Flames, the Stars beat the Oilers two nights later, 3–1. This would be their last win of the season, as the Stars were rolled over by the Canucks and Sharks. Even though they had lost the division crown, the Stars still had a chance to clinch a playoff spot. The Stars, however, were eliminated from playoff contention on April 5 in a 2–0 loss to the playoff-bound Nashville Predators. The team failed to qualify for the post-season for the fourth consecutive year, setting a franchise record for futility.|$|E
