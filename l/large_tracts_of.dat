5|$|The {{widespread}} {{circulation of}} coin cash allowed successful merchants to invest money in land, empowering the very social class the government attempted to suppress through heavy commercial and property taxes. Emperor Wu even enacted laws which banned registered merchants from owning land, yet powerful merchants {{were able to}} avoid registration and own <b>large</b> <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> land.|$|E
5|$|Although early humans {{gathered}} uncultivated {{plant materials}} {{for food and}} employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing, most modern human use of plants is through agriculture. The clearance of <b>large</b> <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> land for crop growth {{has led to a}} significant reduction in the amount available of forestation and wetlands, resulting in the loss of habitat for many plant and animal species as well as increased erosion.|$|E

5|$|Among Harrison's most {{enduring}} legacies is {{the series of}} treaties that he either negotiated or signed with Native American leaders during his tenure as the Indiana territorial governor. As part of the treaty negotiations, the native tribes ceded <b>large</b> <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> land in the west that provided additional acreage for purchase and settlement. Harrison's chief presidential legacy lies in his campaigning methods, which {{laid the foundation for}} the modern presidential campaign tactics.|$|E

It includes Great Malvern on the steep eastern flank of the Malvern Hills, {{as well as the}} former independent urban district of Malvern Link. Many of the major suburbs and settlements that comprise the town are separated by <b>large</b> <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> open common land and fields, and together with smaller civil parishes adjoining the town's boundaries and the hills, the built up area is often referred to collectively as The Malverns.|$|E
5|$|Clark's militia {{was under}} the {{authority}} of the state of Virginia, and although a continental flag was flown over Fort Sackville, the area was governed as Virginia territory until the state gave it to the United States federal government in 1784.

5|$|In the mid-16thcentury Henry VIII of England {{dissolved}} the monasteries, {{resulting in}} the large areas of land owned by Meaux Abbey, Bridlington Priory and other monastic holdings being confiscated. The Crown subsequently sold these <b>large</b> <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> land into private ownership. Along with the land already belonging to lay owners, they formed some of the vast estate holdings which continued {{to exist in the}} Riding until the 20thcentury.|$|E
5|$|Tropical dry {{deciduous}} {{forests are}} found {{in all parts of}} the plains. Since much sunlight reaches the ground, shrubs and grasses are also abundant. <b>Large</b> <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> these forests have been cleared for cultivation. Tropical thorny forests, consisting of widely scattered thorny trees, mainly babool are mostly found in the southwestern parts of the state. These forests are confined to areas which have low annual rainfall (50–70cm), a mean annual temperature of 25–27°C and low humidity.|$|E
5|$|During the 13th century, {{agricultural}} land {{around the town}} was acquired by Fountains and Furness Abbeys. The latter, already prosperous from the wool trade, wished to expand its sheep farming, and in 1208 bought <b>large</b> <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> land from Alice de Romilly. She also negotiated with Fountains Abbey, to which she sold Derwent Island in Derwentwater, land at Watendlath, the mill at Crosthwaite and other land in Borrowdale. Keswick was at {{the hub of the}} monastic farms in the area, and Fountains based a steward in the town, where tenants paid their rents. Furness also enjoyed profitable rights to the extraction of iron ore.|$|E

5|$|In 1374, Tvrtko married Dorothea, {{daughter}} of Tsar Ivan Stratsimir of Bulgaria. The marriage was likely arranged by Louis, who had kept Dorothea {{and her sister}} as honored hostages at his court to ensure Ivan Stratsimir's loyalty. The bride was Orthodox, but the marriage was celebrated in the Catholic rite by Tvrtko's old enemy Peter, Bishop of Bosnia, to whom Tvrtko then awarded <b>large</b> <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> land. Tvrtko thereby solidified his relations with the Roman Catholic Church and earned recognition from Pope Gregory XI.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th {{century the}} Grand Duchy of Moscow {{continued}} activities aimed at unifying the old Rus' lands still under Lithuanian rule. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania had insufficient resources to counter Moscow's advances, already having {{to control the}} Rus' population within its borders {{and not being able}} to count on loyalty of Rus' feudal lords. As a result of the protracted war at the turn of the 15th and 16th centuries, Moscow acquired <b>large</b> <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> territory east of the Dnieper River. Polish assistance and involvement were increasingly becoming a necessary component of the balance of power in the eastern reaches of the Lithuanian domain.|$|E
5|$|Sarawak {{contains}} <b>large</b> <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> tropical rainforest {{with diverse}} plant species, {{which has led}} to a number of them being studied for medicinal properties. Mangrove and nipah forests lining its estuaries comprise 2% of its forested area, peat swamp forests along other parts of its coastline cover 16%, Kerangas forest covers 5% and Dipterocarpaceae forests cover most mountainous areas. The major trees found in estuary forests include bako and nibong, while those in the peat swamp forests include ramin (Gonystylus bancanus), meranti (Shorea), and medang jongkong (Dactylocladus stenostachys).|$|E

5|$|The Quwatlis were {{a family}} of merchants, who became wealthy from trading with Arabia, and moved to Damascus from Baghdad in the 18th-century. The family {{established}} itself {{in the district of}} al-Shaghour in Damascus, and by 1860, some of the family's wealth was invested in buying <b>large</b> <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> land in the Ghouta farms surrounding Damascus. The family's notable status was owed to their wealth, rather than an aristocratic or religious lineage, and their traditional spheres of activity were commerce and the Ottoman civil service.|$|E
5|$|The abbey {{was founded}} in the 7th century and {{enlarged}} in the 10th. It was destroyed by a major fire in 1184, but subsequently rebuilt and by the 14th century {{was one of the}} richest and most powerful monasteries in England. The abbey controlled <b>large</b> <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> the surrounding land and was instrumental in major drainage projects on the Somerset Levels. The abbey was suppressed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries under King Henry VIII of England. The last abbot, Richard Whiting (Whyting), was hanged, drawn and quartered as a traitor on Glastonbury Tor in 1539.|$|E
5|$|The large Goodyear fan-belt factory at Silverwood Industrial Estate was {{a product}} of the Craigavon {{development}} when <b>large</b> <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> land in Lurgan, Portadown, and areas in between were zoned off for exclusive industrial use. The Goodyear factory closed in 1983 after failing to make a profit, resulting in the loss of 750 jobs. The facility was later partly occupied by Wilson Double Deck Trailers and DDL Electronics. Silverwood Industrial Estate continues to host other manufacturing and light engineering firms. Other industrial areas in the town are Annesborough and Halfpenny Valley (Portadown Road) industrial estates; areas in which growth has been limited compared to other industrial estates in the Craigavon Borough.|$|E

5|$|Washington's {{introduction}} to surveying began {{at an early}} age through school exercises that taught him the basics of the profession, followed by practical experience in the field. His first experiences at surveying occurred in the territory surrounding Mount Vernon. His first opportunity as a surveyor occurred in 1748 when he was invited to join a survey party organized by his neighbor and friend George Fairfax of Belvoir. Fairfax organized a professional surveying party to lay out <b>large</b> <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> land along the border of western Virginia, where the young Washington gained invaluable experience in the field.|$|E
5|$|As the queen's son Radama grew to adulthood, {{he became}} {{increasingly}} disillusioned {{by the high}} death toll of his mother's military campaigns and traditional measures of justice, and was frustrated by her unilateral rejection of European influence. The young prince developed sympathetic relationships with the handful of Europeans permitted by Ranavalona to frequent her court, namely Jean Laborde and Joseph-François Lambert, with whom he privately concluded the lucrative Lambert Charter. The charter, which would come into effect upon Radama's accession to the throne, granted Lambert <b>large</b> <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> land and exclusive rights to road construction, mineral extraction, timber harvesting and other activities on the island. In May 1857, when Rainilaiarivony was 29 years old, Lambert consequently invited Prince Radama, Rainivoninahitriniony, Rainilaiarivony {{and a number of}} other officers to conspire with him in a plot to overthrow Ranavalona.|$|E
5|$|During his voyage, Cook also visited New Zealand, first {{discovered}} by Dutch explorer Abel Tasman in 1642, and claimed the North and South islands for the British crown in 1769 and 1770 respectively. Initially, {{interaction between the}} indigenous Māori population and Europeans {{was limited to the}} trading of goods. European settlement increased through {{the early decades of the}} 19th century, with numerous trading stations established, especially in the North. In 1839, the New Zealand Company announced plans to buy <b>large</b> <b>tracts</b> <b>of</b> land and establish colonies in New Zealand. On 6 February 1840, Captain William Hobson and around 40 Maori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi. This treaty is considered by many to be New Zealand's founding document, but differing interpretations of the Maori and English versions of the text have meant that it continues to be a source of dispute.|$|E
