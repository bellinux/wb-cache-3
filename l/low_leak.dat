Each particular combination of construction materials and design features has practical limits with respect to temperature, differential pressure, speed, applied loads and operating environment; however, these limits can generally be overcome by carefully selecting or designing the device for the application. Necessary features may include multiple ferrofluid stages, water cooling, customized materials including metals, permanent magnets and ferrofluid, and exotic bearings. Ferrofluid-based seals have extremely <b>low</b> <b>leak</b> rates - almost immeasurable with laboratory equipment - however they cannot reach the levels of welded connections or other all-metal, static (non-rotating) seals.|$|E

A vessel or system is sometimes pressure tested by filling with air and the pressure monitored {{to see if it}} drops, indicating a leak. A very commonly used test after new construction or repair is a hydrostatic test, sometimes called a pressure test. In a hydrostatic test, a system is pressurized with water to look for a drop in pressure or to see where it leaks out. Helium testing may be done to detect for any very small leakage such as when testing certain diaphragm or bellows valves, made for high purity and utra high purity service, requiring <b>low</b> <b>leak</b> rate capability.

40|$|The most {{important}} component of the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is the dense electrolyte. Besides gastightness it must fulfill the requirements of good ionic conductivity and stability in reducing and oxidizing atmospheres. For this application yttria-stabilized zirconia is widely used. In this paper the effect of calcination temperature and milling time for zirconia powder stabilized with 8 mol% yttria (8 YSZ) on the gastightness of the electrolyte layer was investigated. The influence of the addition of 0. 77, 2 and 4 wt% Al 2 O 3 to 8 YSZ powder on the tightness and the sinterability of the electrolyte layer was studied. The performance of the cell with the electrolyte doped with 0. 77 wt% Al 2 O 3 was also investigated.

The Al 2 O 3 added to 8 YSZ improved the electrolyte tightness by increasing the sinterability of the electrolyte layer and reducing the sintering time.

Leakage energy consumption is of particular concern in memory structures, such as on-chip caches, for large scale transistors and rare access.

40|$|Bileaflet {{mechanical}} {{heart valves}} (BMHVs) {{are prone to}} thrombus formation in the hinge region due to high shear stress combined with stagnation regions. This thesis research addresses the hypothesis that models that isolate and mimic BMHV hinge geometries {{can be used to}} quantitatively characterize procoagulant potential using a novel in vitro blood flow system. Furthermore, these results can be correlated with digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) measurements detailing flow fields for the same models. 	 The significant findings were that: 1) recalcification of recirculating citrated blood markedly increases the magnitude of thrombus forming reactions and the sensitivity for their detection; 2) platelet activation, and the presence of adequate platelet numbers are essential for the activation of coagulation under conditions of high shear; and 3) thrombin formation can be inhibited by blocking the platelet receptors that facilitate platelet aggregation. The DPIV studies give some insight into why different channel geometries resulted in varying propensities for coagulation. The channel geometries with abrupt changes in diameter induced significantly higher levels of TAT and also formed jets that were subject to increased entrainment of the stagnant fluid in the chamber. This entrainment enables more mixing of the shear-activated platelets with the surrounding flow, which can propagate the coagulation cascade, thus increasing the chance for thrombus formation. The influence of abrupt changes in diameter was also evident in the BMHV human blood studies. The MP valve, which has a tortuous hinge pathway, induced significantly more TAT formation than the SJM Standard valve with a smoother hinge channel. Thus, BMHV hinge geometry should be as smooth and free of diameter changes as possible to eliminate stagnation regions that enable activated platelets to congregate and propagate the coagulation cascade. Leakage gap width also had a significant effect not only on procoagulant potential but also on platelet activation. Both the <b>low</b> and high <b>leaker</b> prototype valves had significantly higher levels of platelet activation compared to the SJM Standard valve, but only the <b>low</b> <b>leaker</b> valve demonstrated a higher propensity for coagulation. Thus, to minimize both platelet activation and thromboemboli formation, an optimal gap width should be maintained for BMHVs. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Ajit P. Yoganathan; Committee Member: Dale E.

40|$|Background The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess whether the use of staple line reinforcement (SLR) reduces staple line complications (SLC). Mechanical staple lines are essential for gastrointestinal surgery such as bariatric surgery. However, SLC, such as bleeding and leakage, still occur. The purposes of this study were to provide quantitative evidence on the relative efficacy of gastric SLR and to compare the rates of effectiveness of three commonly used methods. Methods A search of the medical literature in English lan-guage journals identified studies from Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 31, 2013, using the following reinforcement types: (1) no reinforcement, (2) oversewing, (3) a biocompatible glycolide copolymer, and (4) bovine pericardium after gastric bypasses and sleeve gastrectomies. Types of reinforcement were compared using a random-effects model. Results This meta-analysis reviewed 16, 967 articles, extracting data on 56, 309 patients concerning leak and 41, 864 patients concerning bleeding. Over 40 % of patients had no reinforcement, resulting in the highest leak rate (2. 75 %) and bleed rate (3. 45 %). Overall, reinforcing with bovine peri-cardium had the <b>lowest</b> <b>leak</b> (1. 28 %) and bleed (1. 23 %) rates. Suture oversewing was better than no reinforcement but not as effective as bovine pericardium for leak (2. 45 %) and bleed (2. 69 %) rates. Buttressing with a biocompatible glycolide copolymer resulted in the second highest leak rate (2. 61 %) and a bleed rate of 2. 48 % but had significantly lower bleed rates than no reinforcement. Conclusions SLR provided superior results for patients com-pared to no reinforcement for reducing SLC. Buttressing with bovine pericardium resulted in the most favorable outcomes. The effectiveness of different methods used to reinforce the staple line in gastric surgery does not appear to be equal. Keywords Staple lines. Staple line leak. Staple line bleed.
