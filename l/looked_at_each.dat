5|$|After Groenlo was secured, Mondragón marched {{south to}} Rheinberg {{to cover the}} town from a Dutch attack. He encamped his army near Wesel, at Dinslaken, while Maurice {{followed}} him and took up positions at Bislich, both armies being separated by the Lippe river. The Spanish position was strong; the rearguard and the left flank covered by the Rhine and the right flank by the Lippe {{and a range of}} moorland hills called Testerburg. For several weeks both armies <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other, often skirmishing when both cavalries sallied to forage. As time passed, the Spanish foragers were forced to look for victuals two or three leagues far away from their camp. Maurice took the opportunity to plan a mock ambush on Mondragón's foraging convoy aiming to lure him into a general action in which he could destroy the Spanish army. Mondragón also hoped to lure his enemy into a trap.|$|E

Butch was pounding away and Shirley had a live mic. After the first run-through, we all <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other and said, 'This feels really good.'" [...] Erikson later recalled. The group enjoyed the experience of performing together {{so much that they}} quickly changed their minds, and scheduled tourdates later that year.|$|E

Abbe <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> one in turn, then casually took his wallet out of his jacket pocket, throwing it on the floor between himself and the antagonists. He pointed to the wallet and said, [...] "I am prepared to die for that wallet, what about you?"

500|$|After collaborating in 2002's Minority Report, Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise were {{interested}} in working together again. Spielberg stated about Cruise, [...] "He's such an intelligent, creative partner, and brings such great ideas to the set that we just spark each other. [...] I love working with Tom Cruise." [...] Cruise met with Spielberg during the filming of Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can (2002) and gave three options of films to create together, one of them being an adaptation of The War of the Worlds. Spielberg chose The War of the Worlds and stated, [...] "We <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other and the lights went on. [...] As soon as I heard it, I said 'Oh my God!

500|$|In one {{sequence}} {{the character}} Martin Vanger plays the song [...] "Orinoco Flow" [...] by Enya before beginning his torture of Mikael Blomkvist. David Fincher, the director, {{said that he}} believed that Martin [...] "doesn’t like to kill, he doesn’t like to hear the screams, without hearing his favorite music" [...] so therefore the character should play a song during the scene. Daniel Craig, the actor who played Blomkvist, selected [...] "Orinoco Flow" [...] on his iPod as a candidate song. Fincher said [...] "And we all almost pissed ourselves, we were laughing so hard. No, actually, it’s worse than that. He said, ‘Orinoco Flow!’ Everybody <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other, like, what is he talking about? And he said, ‘You know, “Sail away, sail away...”’ And I thought, this {{guy is going to}} make Blomkvist as metro as we need." ...|$|E

500|$|In May 1974, Los Angeles Times critic Robert Hilburn {{reviewed}} the second New York Dolls album, Too Much Too Soon. [...] "I told ya the New York Dolls were the real thing," [...] he wrote, describing the album as [...] "perhaps {{the best example}} of raw, thumb-your-nose-at-the-world, punk rock since the Rolling Stones' Exile on Main Street." [...] Bassist Jeff Jensen of Boston's Real Kids reports of a show that year, [...] "A reviewer for one of the free entertainment magazines of the time caught the act and gave us a great review, calling us a 'punk band.'... e all sort of <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other and said, 'What's punk?'"

I never was a punk." ...|$|E
500|$|Hanneman later {{admitted}} {{that while the}} band was listening to Metallica and Megadeth at the time, they were finding the repetition of guitar riffs tiring. He said, [...] "If we do a verse two or three times, we're already bored with it. So we weren't {{trying to make the}} songs shorter—that's just what we were into," [...] which resulted in the album's short duration of 29 minutes. King had stated that while hour-long records seem to be the trend, [...] "ou could lose this part; you could cut this song completely, and make a much more intense record, which is what we're all about." [...] When the record was completed, the band met with Rubin, who asked: [...] "Do you realize how short this is?" [...] Slayer members <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other, and replied: [...] "So what?" [...] The entire album was on one side of a cassette; King stated it was [...] "neat," [...] as [...] "You could listen to it, flip it over, and play it again." [...] The music is abrasive and faster than previous releases, helping to narrow the gap between thrash metal and its predecessor hardcore punk, and is played at an average of 220 beats per minute.|$|E

[...] whole idea of when you lose people that are close to you, it changes your life and changes your perspective. When they came into the studio, I played them the idea for the song and when [...] was finished, they <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other, a bit stunned, and told me that Nathan [...] "Nate" [...] Morris had written a song for his road manager who had passed away. It had {{basically}} the same lyrics and fitted over the same chord changes. It was really, really weird, we finished the song right then and there. We were all kinda flipped about it ourselves.

500|$|Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic were {{hesitant}} though, as {{they had}} sent the track for consideration already and been unsuccessful. According to Hunte, when a Notorious B.I.G. figure she kept by the computer fell over as they played the track for Platt—a statue that had never moved before regardless of how loud they've blasted music—she realized it was an omen. She commented, [...] "We all just <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other like, 'if Biggie approves, then, send it to Jay'". The next day Platt sent it to Jay-Z and he [...] "loved it and recorded it that night". Hunte recalls, [...] "We were just so happy he wanted to honor our work and our production. Two female producers/writers, and {{for him as a}} rapper to take our song—that's not a combination you see a lot. For him to be so open-minded about it, we just couldn't be any more grateful and thankful." [...] Originally composed as a song to be sung, Jay-Z ended up rewriting new verses inspired from the original lyrics and leaving Hunte on the song's hook. However, when Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic were asked if they thought someone else would be more appropriate for the chorus, Hunte suggested R and soul artist Alicia Keys. Hunte said, [...] "She's never done a record with him and she also has my same vocal tone. She made the song sound so close to the original, She just nailed it and brought it home. It was a great choice." [...] Keys also contributed to writing [...] "Empire State of Mind"s new bridge.|$|E
500|$|After two weeks, Worsley {{began to}} worry about the lack of {{sightings}} and advised Shackleton he could not calculate their position to less than [...] accuracy. As a result, Shackleton opted to aim for the western side of South Georgia which meant, given the prevailing winds, that if they missed their target they would be carried onto the east coast of the island. The following day, they began to observe drifting seaweed and seabirds circulating overhead, indicating the presence of land ahead. On 8 May, through mists and squalls, the crew sighted South Georgia's Cape Demidov, precisely in line with the course calculated by Worsley. He saw a [...] "...towering black crag, with a lacework of snow around its flanks. One glimpse, and it was hidden again. We <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other with cheerful, foolish grins." [...] Sea and wind conditions were such that they were unable to {{make their way to the}} Norwegian whaling stations, some [...] away, on the east coast; instead they made for King Haakon Bay. Now out of drinking water, they were forced by the high seas to approach the rocky coast with care and heave to for the night. A gale blew strongly the following day and despite their best efforts, they stayed offshore for a further night. Conditions were much better on 10 May and after adverse winds caused failure of his first few attempts, Worsley carefully sailed the James Caird through a rocky reef guarding King Haakon Bay and onto the beach.|$|E
500|$|After [...] "Freakshow" [...] is Blackouts eight track, [...] "Toy Soldier", a R and dance-pop song {{reminiscent}} of Destiny's Child's song [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] (2004) that showcases a military drumroll and Spears singing about needing a new lover. In [...] "Hot as Ice", a R song featuring background vocals by T-Pain, she sings {{in a higher}} register: [...] "I'm just a girl {{with the ability to}} drive a man crazy / Make him call me 'mama', make him my new baby." [...] Blackouts tenth track [...] "Ooh Ooh Baby" [...] contains a flamenco guitar and blends the beat from Gary Glitter's [...] "Rock and Roll" [...] (1972) and the melody of The Turtles' [...] "Happy Together" [...] (1967). In the lyrics, she sings to a lover [...] "Touch me and I come alive / I can feel you on my lips / I can feel you deep inside". Kara DioGuardi said she was inspired by the relationship between Spears and her first son in the studio, saying: [...] "I would look at the two of them, the way they <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>each</b> other and the way she would hold the baby. It kind of struck me as interesting. At times it'd be about a kid at times about a lover." [...] "Perfect Lover", an R song, has a propulsive, clattery belly-dance beat in which Spears sings lyrics such as [...] "Tick-tock / Tick-tock / Come and get me while I'm hot". The twelfth track is [...] "Why Should I Be Sad", a midtempo R song directed to her ex-husband Kevin Federline. One of the bonus tracks, [...] "Everybody", samples Eurythmics' [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" [...] (1983). It features Spears singing about the dancefloor in a breathy lower register.|$|E
