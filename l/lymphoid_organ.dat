40|$|Toxicologic {{pathology}} plays {{a crucial}} role in the identification and interpretation of substance-induced health effects. Histology of <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> is quite sensitive, although it does not flag every model immunotoxic substance. Subtle interferences of toxic compounds, like transmembrane signaling and cell activation, are often not detectable by conventional histology. The immune system by its very dynamic nature manifests a bandwidth in its morphological picture, hence the 'normal' state can be quite variable. Interspecies- and interstrain-dependent differences in the histophysiology of <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> should be taken into account, as well as the functional and morphological changes in <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> during life. Increased susceptibility to immunotoxicants may occur during periods of marked histophysiological changes in <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs.</b> The high sensitivity at perinatal age for a number of immunotoxicants has received specific attention in immunotoxicity testing. In the interpretation of effects, it should be noted that particular components of <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> may be decreased in number (suppressed-involuted) or increased (stimulated-expanded), but that does not necessarily reflect the overall effects on the immune system.

25|$|The thymus is {{a primary}} <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organ</b> and the site of {{maturation}} for T cells, the lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system. The thymus increases in size from birth in response to postnatal antigen stimulation, then to puberty and regresses thereafter.

Histologically, each lobe of the thymus can be divided into a central medulla and a peripheral cortex which is surrounded by an outer capsule. The cortex and medulla play different roles in the development of T cells.

The upper limit of the oropharynx is marked by the soft palate, and its lower limit by the epiglottis and root of the tongue. The oropharynx communicates with the mouth, in front through {{what is known as}} the oropharyngeal isthmus, or isthmus of the fauces. The isthmus (i.e. connection) is formed above by the soft palate, below by the posterior third of the tongue, and at the sides by the palatoglossal arches. The posterior third of the tongue, or tongue base contains numerous follicles of lymphatic tissue that form the lingual tonsils. Adjacent to the tongue base, the lingual surface of the epiglottis, which curves forward, is attached to the tongue by median and lateral glossoepiglottic folds. The folds form small troughs known as the epiglottic valleculae. The lateral walls are marked by two vertical pillars on each side, the pillars of the fauces, or palatoglossal arches. More properly they are separately named the palatoglossal arch anteriorly and the palatopharyngeal arch posteriorly. The anterior arch is named from the palatoglossal muscle within, running from the soft palate to the tongue [...] (glossus), while the posterior arch similarly contains the palatopharyngeal muscle running from the soft palate to the lateral pharynx.

40|$|Inhibition of {{dendritic}} cell (DC) migration into tissues and secondary <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> is an {{efficient way to}} induce immunosuppression and tolerance. CCR 7 and PGE 2 are critical for DC migration to secondary <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> where DC initiate immune response. Triptolide, an active component purified from the medicinal plant Tripterygium Wilfordii Hook F., is a potent immunosuppressive drug capable of prolonging allograft survival in organ transplantation by inhibiting T cell activation and proliferation. Considering the essential role in T cell tolerance of DC migration to secondary <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs,</b> here we demonstrate that triptolide can significantly inhibit LPS-triggered upregulation of CCR 7 expression and PGE 2 production by inhibiting cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) expression in DC, thus impairing DC migration towards CCR 7 ligand CCL 19 /MIP- 3 β in vitro. Moreover, triptolide-treated DC display impaired migration into secondary <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> and in vivo administration of triptolide also inhibits DC migration. Further studies show that the triptolide-mediated inhibitory effects of LPS-induced activation of phosphatidylinositol- 3 kinase (PI 3 -K) /Akt and nuclear NF-κB activation are involved in down-regulation of COX- 2 and CCR 7 expression resulting in impaired migration to secondary <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> of DC. Therefore, inhibition of DC migration through decreasing COX- 2 and CCR 7 expression via PI 3 -K/Akt and NF-κB signal pathways provides additional mechanistic explanation for triptolide's immunosuppressive effect. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

CCR 7 -deficient mice show severely delayed kinetics regarding the antibody response and lack contact sensitivity and delayed type hypersensitivity reactions. Due to the impaired migration of lymphocytes, these animals reveal profound morphological alterations in all secondary <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs.</b> Upon activation, mature skin dendritic cells fail to migrate into the draining lymph nodes.

40|$|The blood {{vasculature}} regulates {{both the}} development and function of secondary <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> by providing a portal for entry of hemopoietic cells. During the development of <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> in the embryo, blood vessels deliver lymphoid tissue inducer cells that initiate and sustain the development of lymphoid tissues. In adults, the blood vessels are structurally distinct from those in other organs due to the requirement for high levels of lymphocyte recruitment under non-inflammatory conditions. In lymph nodes (LNs) and Peyer’s patches, high endothelial venules (HEVs) especially adapted for lymphocyte trafficking form a spatially organized network of blood vessels, which controls both the type of lymphocyte and the site of entry into lymphoid tissues. Uniquely, HEVs express vascular addressins that regulate lymphocyte entry into <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> and are, therefore, critical to the function of <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs.</b> Recent studies have demonstrated important roles for CD 11 c+ dendritic cells in the induction, {{as well as the}} maintenance, of vascular addressin expression and, therefore, the function of HEVs. Tertiary <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> (TLOs) are HEV containing LN-like structures that develop inside organized tissues undergoing chronic immune-mediated inflammation. In autoimmune lesions, the development of TLOs is thought to exacerbate disease. In cancerous tissues, the development of HEVs and TLOs is associated with improved patient outcomes in several cancers. Therefore, {{it is important to understand}} what drives the development of HEVs and TLOs and how these structures contribute to pathology.

40|$|International audienceBackground CD 4 T cell {{lymphopenia}} is {{an important}} T cell defect associated to ageing. Higher susceptibility to infections, cancer, or autoimmune pathologies described in aged individuals is thought to partly rely on T cell lymphopenia. We hypothesize that such diverse effects may reflect anatomical heterogeneity of age related T cell lymphopenia. Indeed, no data are currently available {{on the impact of}} ageing on T cell pool recovered from gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), a crucial site of CD 4 T cell accumulation. Results Primary, secondary and tertiary <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> of C 57 BL/ 6 animals were analysed at three intervals of ages: 2 to 6  months (young), 10 to 14  months (middle-aged) and 22 to 26  months (old). We confirmed that ageing preferentially impacted CD 4 T cell compartment in secondary <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs.</b> Importantly, a different picture emerged from gut associated mucosal sites: during ageing, CD 4 T cell accumulation was progressively developing in colon and small intestine lamina propria and Peyer's patches. Similar trend was also observed in middle-aged SJL/B 6 F 1 mice. Interestingly, an inverse correlation was detected between CD 4 T cell numbers in secondary <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> and colonic lamina propria of C 57 BL/ 6 mice whereas no increase in proliferation rate of GALT CD 4 T cells was detected. In contrast to GALT, no CD 4 T cell accumulation was detected in lungs and liver in middle-aged animals. Finally, the concomitant accumulation of CD 4 T cell in GALT and depletion in secondary <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> during ageing was detected both in male and female animals. Conclusions Our data thus demonstrate that T cell lymphopenia in secondary <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> currently associated to ageing is not sustained in gut or lung mucosa associated lymphoid tissues or non-lymphoid sites such as the liver. The inverse correlation between CD 4 T cell numbers in secondary <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> and colonic lamina propria and the absence of overt proliferation in GALT suggest that marked CD 4 T cell decay in secondary <b>lymphoid</b> <b>organs</b> during ageing reflect redistribution of CD 4 T cells rather than generalized CD 4 T cell decay. Such anatomical heterogeneity may provide an important rationale for the diversity of immune defects observed during ageing...|$|R
