40|$|Background: {{the impact}} of early {{postnatal}} androgen exposure on female <b>laryngeal</b> <b>tissue</b> may depend on certain characteristics of this exposure. We assessed {{the impact of}} the dose, duration, and timing of early androgen exposure on the vocal development of female subjects who had been treated for adrenocortical tumor (ACT) in childhood. Methods: the long-term effects of androgen exposure on the fundamental vocal frequency (F 0), vocal pitch, and final height and the presence of virilizing signs were examined in 9 adult (age, 18. 4 to 33. 5 years) and 10 adolescent (13. 6 to 17. 8 years) female ACT patients. We also compared the current values with values obtained 0. 9 years to 7. 4 years after these subjects had undergone ACT surgery, a period during which they had shown normal androgen levels. Results: of the 19 subjects, 17 (89 %) had been diagnosed with ACT before 4 years of age, 1 (5 %) at 8. 16 years, and 1 (5 %) at 10. 75 years. Androgen exposure (2 to 30 months) was sufficiently strong to cause pubic hair growth in all subjects and clitoromegaly in 74 % (14 / 19) of the subjects, but did not reduce their height from the target value. Although androgen exposure induced a remarkable reduction in F 0 (132 Hz) and moderate pitch virilization in 1 subject and partial F 0 virilization, resulting in F 0 of 165 and 169 Hz, in 2 subjects, the majority had normal F 0 ranging from 189 to 245 Hz. Conclusions: Female <b>laryngeal</b> <b>tissue</b> is less sensitive to androgen exposure between birth and adrenarche than during other periods. Differential larynx sensitivity to androgen exposure in childhood and F 0 irreversibility in adulthood are age-, concentration-, duration-, and timing-dependent events that may also be affected by exposure to inhibitory or stimulatory hormones.

All non-tumoral tissues showed equally strong membranous expression of β-catenin, while cytoplasmic expression was found in only 3 of the 11 samples. By contrast, whereas 8 / 9 glottic LSCCs exhibited only membranous expression of β-catenin, 6 / 7 supraglottic LSCCs displayed both membranous and cytoplasmic expression (p =  0. 003).

The patient suffered an exceedingly rare complication of the surgery - laryngeal dislocation. Had the deformed laryngeal structures been overlooked and the patient extubated as usual after surgery, reintubation {{would have been impossible}} due to the associated swelling, which might have had disastrous consequences. Leftward dislocation of the larynx became apparent post-operatively, but prior to extubation. Extubation was therefore postponed and a subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan revealed entrapment of laryngeal structures within the osteosynthesis. A trial of repositioning using microlaryngoscopy performed by otolaryngology (ears, nose and throat) specialists failed, making open surgical revision necessary. At surgery, the entrapped <b>laryngeal</b> <b>tissue</b> was successfully mobilised.

40|$|Objective: The larynx is {{considered}} a secondary sexual organ. To demonstrate that sex hormones can directly influence laryngeal function, specific receptors in the vocal cord must be identified. Materials and Methods: We searched for estrogen, progesterone and androgen receptors, using an immunohistochemical method, in normal human vocal cords (from 3 cadavers) and in samples of healthy vocal cords and of laryngeal carcinomas from 15 live subjects. Breast and prostate carcinoma were used as controls. Results: In all the normal samples tested, the results were negative; {{there was only a}} nonspecific cytoplasmatic response in the subepithelial glands (false positives). In the neoplastic tissue, 2 samples had a weak nuclear focal positivity for estrogen and progesterone receptors; all 15 subjects studied were negative for androgen receptors. Conclusions: Since our data show that sex hormone receptors are absent in the vocal cords, other theories must be considered to explain the fact that hormones influence the quality of the voice. This study discusses the possibility that the changes of voice according to gender and throughout life might be linked with a different expression of some growth factors in the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>tissue</b> and that this expression might in turn be influenced by hormonal variations.

40|$|CONCLUSION: Endoscopic {{resection}} of laryngeal and tracheal lesions {{using the}} microdebrider is a safe, accurate and reliable method. OBJECTIVE: The microdebrider {{is an important}} tool for endoscopic nasal and sinus surgery and {{over the last few}} years a powered blade with a long shaft has been developed for endoscopic laryngeal and tracheal surgery. The aim of this non-randomized prospective study was to determine the advantages and disadvantages of the microdebrider for treating patients with different laryngeal and tracheal pathologies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The laryngeal microdebrider was used under endoscopic control in 37 patients. In 29 cases a benign laryngeal lesion was removed endoscopically. In four patients debulking of a malignant obstructive endolaryngeal tumor was performed in order to avoid a tracheotomy. In four cases a bulky obstructing endotracheal lesion was removed. RESULTS: All laryngotracheal lesions could be removed, and this was facilitated by the use of angled rigid telescopes and the laryngeal blade. No traumatic lesions to normal <b>laryngeal</b> <b>tissue</b> occurred as a result of use of the microdebrider and no postoperative endolaryngeal bleeding was observed.

Luciferase, electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed c-Myc could regulate the promoter activity of MYCT 1 -TV by specifically binding to the E-box elements within - 886 to - 655 bp region. These results were further verified by site-directed mutagenesis and RNA interference (RNAi) assays.

40|$|International audienceThe {{vocal folds}} are soft multi-layered <b>laryngeal</b> <b>tissues,</b> owning {{remarkable}} vibro-mechanical performances. Composed of collagen and elastin microfibrils' networks, the upper layers {{play a major}} role in the vocal-fold vibrations. However, the impact of these tissues' histological features on their mechanical behavior is still poorly known. This is mainly ascribed to their challenging experimental characterization: vocal folds together with their fibrous architectures are not easily observable in vivo; ex vivo mechanical tests are rare and complex to interpret [1]. Consequently, most of the vocal-fold mechanical models developed so far rely on phenomenological macroscopic approaches, roughly assuming a homogeneous vocal tissue with linear-elastic properties. Since 2010, a few authors have started to investigate and model the vocal-tissue collagenous fibrous microstructure, opening a new insight into voice biomechanics [2]. Theoretical formulations at the fiber scale still need to be developed. Thereby, this study aims at: (i) proposing an idealized but relevant model of the fibrous architecture of the vocal-fold upper layers; (ii) building a mechanical model able to predict the layers' multiscale properties from the above idealized architectures; (iii) assessing its relevance by comparison with a reference tensile database...|$|R
40|$|Western {{blotting}} {{analysis of}} the p 21 ras oncoprotein was performed in seven normal laryngeal mucosa specimens and 43 primary laryngeal cancers. Varying p 21 levels, expressed as optical density (OD), were found in normal mucosa (median 1. 94 OD, range 0. 90 - 2. 17 OD) and in primary laryngeal tumours (median 1. 74 OD, range 0. 30 - 6. 37 OD). When p 21 expression in laryngeal cancer was compared with the normal counterpart, higher levels were found in neoplastic than in normal <b>laryngeal</b> <b>tissue</b> (median 2. 54 OD, range 1. 76 - 6. 37 OD, vs median 1. 94 OD, range 0. 90 - 2. 17 OD) (P = 0. 023). Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated {{that most of the}} tumour cells (more than 70 %) were immunostained while the stromal component was unreactive. No correlation between p 21 expression and tumour location, stage and histopathological grade was observed. The correlation between ras p 21 protein expression and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) levels was also investigated. EGFR-positive cases did not show any difference in p 21 expression with respect to EGFR-negative cases (median 1. 52 OD, range 0. 30 - 6. 37 OD, vs median 1. 84 OD, range 0. 93 - 3. 71 OD). Our findings suggest that overexpression of p 21 protein is associated with a malignant phenotype in laryngeal cancer. Further studies should be undertaken to evaluate whether the assessment of p 21 protein expression may have clinical significance in laryngeal cancer...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} if follow-up computed tomography (CT) after definitive radiation therapy for laryngeal or hypopharyngeal (laryngopharyngeal) carcinoma allows {{the detection of}} local failure earlier than clinical examination alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pre- and post-radiation therapy follow-up CT scans in 66 patients were reviewed retrospectively. All patients underwent definitive hyperfractionated radiation therapy and were followed up clinically for at least 2 years after its completion. Post-radiation therapy CT scans (N = 153) were evaluated for posttreatment changes with a three-point score: A score of 1 represented expected posttreatment changes; 2, focal mass with a maximal diameter of less than 1 cm and/or asymmetric obliteration of <b>laryngeal</b> <b>tissue</b> planes; or 3, focal mass with a maximal diameter {{equal to or greater}} than 1 cm or estimated tumor volume reduction of less than 50 %. All patients underwent the first posttreatment CT study 1 - 6 months after therapy. New or progressive laryngeal cartilage changes were noted. The clinical impression of the larynx at the time of each follow-up CT scan was also recorded. RESULTS: In 12 of 29 (41 %) patients with treatment failure at the primary site, follow-up CT scans were definite for local failure (score, 3) a mean of 5. 5 months (median, 3. 5 months; range, 1 - 17 months) before clinical examination results. CONCLUSION: In many patients, follow-up CT shows local failure earlier than does clinical examination alone. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In this study, we aim {{to gather}} {{information}} {{about the quality of}} life issues, functional outcomes and voice problems facing early glottic cancer patients treated with the surgical techniques such as laryngofissure cordectomy, fronto-lateral laryngectomy, or cricohyoidopexi. In particular, consistency of life and voice quality issues with the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>tissue</b> excised during surgery is examined. In addition, the effects of arytenoidectomy to the life and voice quality are also studied. Methods 29 male patients were enrolled voluntarily in the study. The average age was 53. 9 years. Three out of 10 patients with laryngofissure cordectomy also had arytenoidectomy. 11 patients had fronto-lateral laryngectomy with Tucker reconstruction, two of which also had arytenoidectomy. There were eight patients with cricohyoidopexi and bilateral functional neck dissection. Three of these patients also had arytenoidectomy. In bilateral functional neck dissection cases, spinal accessory nerve was preserved and level V of the neck was not dissected. None of the patients had neither radiotherapy nor voice therapy. Cordectomy patients never had a temporary tracheotomy or were connected to a feeding tube. Data was collected for 13 months for the cordectomy group, 14 months for fronto-lateral laryngectomy and cricohyoidopexi groups on average post-operatively. Statistical analysis in this study was carried out using the one-way analysis of variance, and the Post-Hoc group comparisons were made after Bonferroni and Scheffé-procedures. In order {{to determine the effects of}} arytenoidectomy, a regression analysis is carried out to see if there are statistical differences in answers given to the survey questions among patients who were arytenoidectomized during their surgeries. Results There was a statistically significant difference between cordectomy and cricohyoidopexi group in answers to the University of Washington- Quality of Life- Revised survey part 1. (p = 0). A statistically significant difference was also established between cordectomy and fronto-lateral laryngectomy groups, as well as between cordectomy and cricohyoidopexi groups in answers to the University of Washington- Quality of Life- Revised survey part 2. (p = 0, 036 and p = 0. 009, respectively). Cricohyoidopexi group has given the lowest scores and the cordectomy group has given the highest scores in three survey questions representing the quality of life, performances and new voices. These ranges are also consistent with the <b>laryngeal</b> <b>tissue</b> excised during surgery (cricohyoidopexi > fronto-lateral laryngectomy > cordectomy). There was no statistically significant difference between groups in Performance Status Scale for Head and Neck cancer patients instrument. The difference between the Voice Handicap Index and Voice Handicap Index (functional); Voice Handicap Index (physical) and Voice Handicap Index (emotional) scores in three patient groups was not significant either. All of the patients evaluated that their new voices have similar functional, physical and emotional impact on their life. Decanulation and oral feeding times of cricohyoidopexi and fronto-lateral laryngectomy patients are found to be significantly longer than cordectomy patients. Lastly, the removal of arytenoid does not have any significant adverse effects on the quality of life, the functional outcomes, or the quality of voice. Conclusion In the present study, all patients with early glottic cancer, treated with different surgical technics reported fairly good quality of life outcomes, functional results and voice qualities. This study also finds that the removal of arytenoid does not have any adverse effects on the quality of life and voice from the patients' point of view. </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Combining primary surgery with {{postoperative}} radiotherapy (RT) significantly reduces locoregional recurrence {{rates in}} selected patients with laryngeal {{squamous cell carcinoma}} (SCC). A prognostic model was used to see if associating <b>laryngeal</b> SCC <b>tissue</b> markers (mammary serine protease inhibitor [MASPIN], CD 105, angiogenin [ANG], and nm 23 -H 1) with conventional criteria could better discriminate higher-risk patients warranting postoperative RT. METHODS: The study involved 76 consecutively operated patients with laryngeal SCC not recommended for postoperative RT, in accord with current guidelines. RESULTS: On multivariate statistical modeling, non-nuclear MASPIN expression (p =. 022), a CD 105 expression ≥ 5. 28...|$|R
