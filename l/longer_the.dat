50|$|To {{play this}} game, two (2) pieces of bamboo sticks (one long, one short) are required. A player {{acts as a}} batter and stands {{opposite}} the others players at a distance. The batter holds the long bamboo stick {{with one hand and}} tosses the short one with the other hand. The batter then strikes the shorter stick with <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> stick. <b>The</b> other players will attempt to catch the flying shorter stick. Whoever catches the stick gets the turn to be the next batter. If nobody catches the stick, any player can pick it up. The batter then puts down <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> stick on <b>the</b> ground. The holder of the shorter stick will throw it with the attempt to hit <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> stick on <b>the</b> ground. If <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> stick is hit, the hitter becomes the next batter. If the player with the shorter stick misses to hit <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> one, <b>the</b> same batter will continue.|$|R

5|$|In 2005, Affeldt {{was again}} {{expected}} to be the Royals' closer. However, he did not get a save opportunity until April 16 against Detroit, and he was unable to finish that game because of a groin injury that landed him on the disabled list again. After rehabbing in Omaha, Affeldt returned to the Royals on June 4. He was no <b>longer</b> <b>the</b> closer, however, because Mike MacDougal had been closing well in his absence. Affeldt was not healthy for long, as he returned to the disabled list on June 20 after reaggravating the groin injury.|$|E

5|$|On 22 June 1941, contravening the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, 5.5 million Axis troops {{attacked}} the Soviet Union. In addition to Hitler's stated purpose of acquiring Lebensraum, this large-scale offensive (codenamed Operation Barbarossa) {{was intended to}} destroy the Soviet Union and seize its natural resources for subsequent aggression against the Western powers. The reaction among Germans was one of surprise and trepidation as many were concerned about how much <b>longer</b> <b>the</b> war would drag on or suspected that Germany could not win a war fought on two fronts.|$|E

5|$|The game engine has {{had major}} {{performance}} {{issues on the}} PlayStation 3. These issues have led to unplayable frame-rates when the save game file gets too big or when DLC is installed.

These same issues plagued , but a performance patch to improve New Vegas seems unlikely. Sawyer said that it is a core-engine issue that can not be so easily patched.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} a changing weather system, which will vary from every hour and will provide obstructions for various forces and installations. For example, fog will close runways whereas storms will temporarily disrupt bombing runs and dogfights. Over time, RAF squadrons {{will run out}} of ammunition or fuel, and thus must replenish at the nearest RAF station, which will render them vulnerable to a Luftwaffe bombing run. In between turns, the player {{has the opportunity to}} request reinforcements from RAF reserves, however the <b>longer</b> <b>the</b> campaign progresses, the quality of the reserves will diminish.|$|E
