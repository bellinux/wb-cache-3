Gareth Peirce obtained another psychologist's report about Raghip and, supported by Raghip's MP Michael Portillo, asked the Home Secretary to review the case. She also submitted an application to the European Court of Human Rights, arguing that the way Raghip had been interviewed breached the European Convention on Human Rights. In December 1990 Home Secretary Kenneth Baker referred Raghip's case back to the Court of Appeal.|$|E
5|$|After the {{resignation}} of Lord Oaksey in 1956 Denning was offered {{a job as a}} <b>Law</b> <b>Lord.</b> After a period of contemplation (he worried that such an appointment would reduce his chances of becoming Master of the Rolls or Lord Chief Justice) he accepted, and was formally offered the job on 5 April 1957. He was appointed on 24 April 1957, as Baron Denning, of Whitchurch in the County of Southampton; for the supporters of his coat of arms he chose Lord Mansfield and Sir Edward Coke. Many members of the judiciary and the Bar approved of his appointment, but he was warned that he should move slowly to reform the court. During his time in the House of Lords he also served as Chairman of the Quarter Sessions of East Sussex. During his time in the House of Lords Denning frequently expressed dissenting opinions. Denning did not enjoy his time in the House of Lords and clashed frequently with Viscount Simonds, who was known as a conservative and orthodox judge. Despite his reputation as a fiercely individual judge, Denning dissented in only 16% of cases he heard in the House of Lords; fewer than Lord Keith, who dissented 22% of the time. On 9 May 1960, Denning was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Sussex.|$|E

Its other three members included a former colonial governor, the head of an Oxford College and a Scottish Lord Provost.|$|E
25|$|On 5 April 1932 Goddard was {{appointed}} a full-time Judge of the King's Bench Division of the High Court of England and Wales, receiving a knighthood later that year. After only six {{years he was}} promoted again to be a Lord Justice of Appeal. Goddard was known for turning out well-argued and legally convincing judgments. He would deliver stern diatribes to criminals, but his sentences were usually moderate, {{even when he was}} personally offended by the crime. After another six-year stint, he {{was appointed}} as a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary upon the death of Lord Atkin in 1944 and received as a <b>Law</b> <b>lord</b> a life peerage.

25|$|There {{are certain}} {{offices of the}} {{executive}} whose pensions are regulated by particular acts of Parliament. Judges of the High Court, on completing fifteen years services or becoming permanently incapacitated for duty, whatever their length of service, may be granted a pension equal to two-thirds of their salary (Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873). The Lord Chancellor of Great Britain however short a time he may have held office, receives a pension of £45,000, but he usually continues to sit as a <b>Law</b> <b>Lord</b> in the House of Lords; so also does the Lord Chancellor of Northern Ireland, who receives a pension of £3,692 6s. A considerable number of local authorities have obtained special parliamentary powers {{for the purpose of}} superannuating their officials and workmen who have reached the age of 65. Poor law officers receive superannuation allowances under the Poor Law Officers Superannuation Act 1864–1897.|$|E
25|$|The {{character}} of Charles Bowen's intellect hardly qualified {{him for some}} of the duties of a puisne judge; but it was otherwise when, in 1882, in succession to Lord Justice John Holker, he was raised to the Court of Appeal. As a Lord Justice of Appeal, he was conspicuous for his learning, his industry and his courtesy to all who appeared before him; and in spite of failing health he sat regularly until August 1893, when, on the retirement of Lord Hannen, he was made a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, and a life peer with the title Baron Bowen, of Colwood in what is now West Sussex. By this time, however, his health had finally broken down; he never sat as a <b>law</b> <b>lord</b> to hear appeals, and he gave but one vote as a peer, while his last public service consisted in presiding over the commission which sat in October 1893 to inquire into the Featherstone riots.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there are}} {{circumstances}} where the courts accept that procedural protections {{should be more}} limited or even placed in abeyance, {{and this is a}} function of context. This is especially so in matters of national security where the sensitivity of such matters demands that the courts do not look closely at government decisions to limit procedural rights. In wartime, the case of Liversidge v. Anderson (1941) is regarded to be of great constitutional significance. The House of Lords found that there could be no inquiry into whether there were reasonable grounds for the detention of the appellant as it was a subjective matter for the Home Security to determine, as prescribed by legislation. However, in Lord Atkin's acclaimed dissenting judgment, he refused to endorse this construction of the <b>law.</b> <b>Lord</b> Atkin's judgment is now taken as the correct decision, where every imprisonment is prima facie illegal until justified by the arresting authority. Nonetheless, national security is still an important issue that can and does limit procedural protection in certain cases.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} {{development of}} the nineteenth century was the <b>Law</b> <b>Lord.</b> In 1856, it was deemed necessary to add a legally qualified peer to the House of Lords: the Lords exercised, and still exercise, certain judicial functions, but did not necessarily include a sufficient number of peers well-versed in law. So that the number of hereditary peers would not be further increased, Victoria made Sir James Parke, a baron of the Exchequer, a life peer as Baron Wensleydale. The Lords refused to admit him, deeming that nothing but an Act of Parliament could change the fundamental hereditary characteristic of the Lords. Bills were later introduced to permit the creation of life peerages, but these failed. Only in 1876, twenty years after the Wensleydale case, was the Appellate Jurisdiction Act passed, authorising the appointment of two Lords of Appeal in Ordinary (commonly called Law Lords) to sit in the House of Lords as barons. They were to hold the rank of baron for life, but sit in the Lords only until retiring from judicial office. In 1887, they were permitted to continue to sit in the Lords for life; the number of Lords of Appeal in Ordinary was also increased by further enactments.|$|E
500|$|On 30 August 1945, Birkett {{received}} a letter from the Lord Chancellor asking him to serve as the British judge at the Nuremberg Trials of German War Criminals. He accepted, saying that it was [...] "a great honour to be selected". But when he went to London to discuss it, he was informed that the Foreign Office wanted a more senior judge to be in attendance, ideally a <b>Law</b> <b>Lord,</b> but since no <b>Law</b> <b>Lord</b> was available, they had requested that a judge from the Court of Appeal should be appointed. Geoffrey Lawrence was made the main British judge, and Birkett was offered the position of alternate judge for the trials, which he accepted, although with less enthusiasm than he had shown when accepting the original offer. He became friends with the American judge Francis Biddle, although when they first met he accidentally confused him with Anthony Drexel Biddle and remarked how useful his diplomatic training would be in the trials.|$|E
500|$|Lord Hope {{also argued}} that Parliament should {{not be able to}} pass {{legislation}} that [...] "is so absurd or so unacceptable that the populace at large refuses to recognise it as law". [...] Jeffrey Jowell suggests that these comments were influenced by Lord Hope's position as a <b>Law</b> <b>Lord</b> from Scotland, where it is unclear whether Parliamentary sovereignty is recognised following MacCormick v Lord Advocate, in which the doctrine was seen as [...] "a distinctively English principle which has no counterpart in Scottish constitutional law".|$|E

500|$|After Baldwin was {{defeated}} at the 1929 British parliamentary election, Ramsay MacDonald of the Labour Party became prime minister. MacDonald desired {{a conference of}} Indian and British leaders in London to discuss India's future, {{a course of action}} supported by Jinnah. Three Round Table Conferences followed over as many years, none of which resulted in a settlement. [...] Jinnah was a delegate to the first two conferences, but was not invited to the last. [...] He remained in Britain for most of the period 1930 through 1934, practising as a barrister before the Privy Council, where he dealt with a number of India-related cases. His biographers disagree over why he remained so long in Britain—Wolpert asserts that had Jinnah been made a <b>Law</b> <b>Lord,</b> he would have stayed for life, and that Jinnah alternatively sought a parliamentary seat. [...] Early biographer Hector Bolitho denied that Jinnah sought to enter the British Parliament, while Jaswant Singh deems Jinnah's time in Britain as a break or sabbatical from the Indian struggle. [...] Bolitho called this period [...] "Jinnah's years of order and contemplation, wedged in between the time of early struggle, and the final storm of conquest".|$|E
500|$|He {{found the}} work in the Court of Appeal dull, and his {{disappointment}} increased the longer he worked. As in the High Court, he felt uncertain about his judgements and unsure as to whether he was affecting the law. Despite his personal opinion of himself, the judiciary as a whole felt that his mix of humanity and common sense was beneficial to the court. During the 1951 Long Vacation he broadcast three talks for the BBC on the subject of international law and its growth and gave a speech for the Law Society titled [...] "The Lawyer's Contribution to Society". Despite his unhappiness with his work in the Court of Appeal, he worked until 1956, when his long service as a judge allowed him to draw a pension. In his remaining time in the Court of Appeal, Birkett judged several notable cases, in particular Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v Boots Cash Chemists (Southern) Ltd [...] 1 QB 401, and Entores Ltd v Miles Far East Corporation [...] 2 QB 327, where the court made a landmark decision on acceptance of a contract in relation to Telex. From April 1958 to October 1961 he sat as a <b>Law</b> <b>Lord,</b> where his cases included De Demko v Home Secretary [...] AC 654 and Ostime v Duple Motor Bodies Ltd [...] AC 459.|$|E

It declared the latter, [...] "revolutionary" [...] constitution illegal, and ruled that the former was overridden by the Southern Rhodesia Act 1965, which had effectively outlawed the Rhodesian legislative, administrative and legal authorities in British <b>law.</b> <b>Lord</b> Reid, delivering the majority opinion (Lord Pearce dissented), argued that the [...] "usurper" [...] government, though the effective master of Rhodesia, could not be considered lawful as the UK government was still attempting to regain control and it was impossible to say whether or not it would succeed. He ruled that only Whitehall could determine what constituted the maintenance of [...] "law and order" [...] in Rhodesia, and that the Rhodesian emergency measures were unlawful as they had been formalised by the Officer Administering the Government, a post-UDI figure who was, in British eyes, unconstitutional. Reid concluded that Madzimbamuto was illegally detained. Harry Davies, one of the Rhodesian judges, announced on 8 August that the Rhodesian courts would not consider this ruling binding as they no longer accepted the Privy Council as part of the Rhodesian judicial hierarchy. Justice JR Dendy Young resigned in protest at Davies' ruling on 12 August and four days later was sworn in as Chief Justice of Botswana.|$|E
