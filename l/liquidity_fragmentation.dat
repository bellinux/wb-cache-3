50|$|The {{increasing}} number of various trading venues and MTFs leads to a surge in <b>liquidity</b> <b>fragmentation,</b> when the same stock is traded on several different venues, so the price {{and the amount of}} stock can vary between them. SOR serves to tackle <b>liquidity</b> <b>fragmentation,</b> or even benefit from it. Smart Order Routing is performed by Smart Order Routers - systems designed to analyze the state of venues and to place orders the best available way, relying on the defined rules, configurations and algorithms.|$|E

40|$|<b>Liquidity</b> <b>fragmentation</b> {{occurs when}} traders have choices in trading fungible securities. This article {{documents}} {{the migration of}} Dow futures’ liquidity from the pit to the electronic market. The implied spread declines dramatically for electronic trades as volume increases over a sample period from April 2002 through December 2004. This implicit cost, despite dwindling volume, does not increase for trades in the pit but drops by about $ 13 per trade. This somewhat surprising result suggests that competition for order flows brings about positive externality within the same exchange. Seller-initiated trades tend to have higher costs on both trading platforms. The implicit cost difference between a buyer-initiated trade and a seller-initiated trade is economically significant. Relative to the implied spread, the average difference is about 13 to 17 % for futures traded outside of the regular hours and 3. 4 to 12 % per trade during the regular hours of cash market...|$|E
40|$|Two {{important}} {{characteristics of}} current equity markets are {{the large number}} of competing trading venues with publicly displayed order books and the substantial fraction of dark trading, which takes place outside such visible order books. This article evaluates the impact on liquidity of dark trading and fragmentation in visible order books. Dark trading has a detrimental effect on <b>liquidity.</b> Visible <b>fragmentation</b> improves <b>liquidity</b> aggregated over all visible trading venues but lowers liquidity at the traditional market, meaning that the benefits of fragmentation are not enjoyed by investors who choose to send orders only to the traditional market. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of the removal of broker {{identifiers}} from the central limit order book of the Australian Stock Exchange. We find that spreads and order aggressiveness decline, and order book depth increases, with the introduction of anonymous trading. This is consistent with the hypothesis that limit order traders are more willing to expose their orders when they can do so anonymously. Anonymous markets attract order flow from non-anonymous substitute markets, but this effect is only seen in large stocks. Our results suggest that exchanges operating in fragmented markets should consider anonymous trading to improve price competition and liquidity, although some of these benefits may be significant only if the stocks are sufficiently large and liquid.

40|$|Two {{important}} {{characteristics of}} current European equity markets {{are rooted in}} changes in financial regulation (the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive). The regulation (i) allows new trading venues to emerge, generating a fragmented market place and (ii) allows for a substantial fraction of trading {{to take place in}} the dark, outside publicly displayed order books. This paper evaluates the impact on <b>liquidity</b> of <b>fragmentation</b> in visible order books and dark trading for a sample of 52 Dutch stocks. We consider global liquidity by consolidating the entire limit order books of all visible European trading venues, and local liquidity by considering the traditional market only. We find that fragmentation in visible order books improves global liquidity, but dark trading has a detrimental e¤ect. In addition, local liquidity is lowered by fragmentation in visible order books. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether a}} Canadian-listed firm seeking to cross-list in the U. S. needs to consider liquidity differences when making a choice among the main U. S. venues (AMEX, NYSE or NASDAQ). After controlling for firm characteristics, {{we find that}} trade costs for Canadian shares cross-listed in the U. S. do {{not depend on the}} U. S. cross-listing venue. This suggests that the choice of U. S. listing venue may be better motivated by the desire to minimize listing fees or to increase investor recognition and visibility.

40|$|Leveraged investors may {{be subject}} to {{contagion}} when sales of repossessed collateral create a downward spiral in fire sales prices, increasing margin requirements and drying up the supply of liquidity. This raises the question whether market integration is desirable when the risk of contagion is significant. While a policy that erects barriers to the free flow of <b>liquidity</b> across countries (<b>fragmentation)</b> can mitigate the incidence of contagion, it creates another problem: Liquidity may remain idle in one country while its neighbour suffers a financial crisis. We conduct a welfare analysis to net out the two effects. We show that, by itself, fragmentation has a negative welfare effect: It can only fend off mild financial crises, at the cost of exposing the country to more severe ones. At the same time, since liquidity is under-provided in a competitive equilibrium, governments should inject more of it, which could involve fragmentation, in some cases. Nevertheless, in the absence of coordination, governments are likely to fragment over and above the social optimum. Such sub-optimal fragmentation is particularly likely when governments become massive suppliers of liquidity. It follows that the recent increase in fragmentation may reflect the implementation of beggar-thy-neighbour policies rather than the proper treatment of market failures...|$|R
40|$|It {{is usually}} thought that network externalities, which are {{inherent}} to liquidity, make it desirable to concentrate transactions in one stock exchange. This paper shows {{that when the}} value of liquidity stems from the ability of potentially reach as many traders as possible, the market is integrated when every broker meets every other broker {{in at least one}} exchange. Thus, fragmentation is not about trades being executed in different exchanges but of connectedness among brokers. An implication of this distinction is that in an integrated market the network externality created by liquidity becomes pecuniary and the optimal number of exchanges depends only on the shape of the (physical) technology to execute trades—whether it exhibits increasing, constant or decreasing returns to scale—as in any standard industry. We characterize the planner’s allocation and compare it with that reached by a monopoly. It is shown that when exchanges are natural monopolies a particular ownership structure of the exchange and allocation of voting rights over the exchange fee achieve the planner’s optimum. With decreasing returns to scale the Walrasian allocation is eficient, provided that the market is integrated. Nevertheless, with few exchanges the price-taking assumption is suspect. If exchanges are not price takers, there are many other equilibria, all of them ineficient. Moreover, there are reasons to doubt that the market will become integrated. Fragmentation softens price competition between exchanges and may help a monopolist exchange to erect a barrier to entry even when he has no cost advantage.
