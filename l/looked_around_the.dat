500|$|While {{composing}} the song's lyrics, Martin {{could not}} find the right words. He was thinking of a specific word, which he deemed a missing key word in the lyrics, to fit the song's concept. He <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> studio and saw Stephanie, a friend who happened to be present in the studio at that time. Martin later titled the song [...] "Yellow" [...] as a reference to Stephanie's yellow glow. The lyrics progressed from there with the band collaborating. Bassist Guy Berryman came up with the opening line [...] "Look at the stars". That night, having quickly composed the song, the band recorded it.|$|E

It's not the old left." ...|$|E

2500|$|Burnham <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> {{world for}} {{indications}} {{of the new}} form of society which was emerging to replace historic capitalism and saw certain commonalities between the economic formations of Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia, and America under Franklin D. Roosevelt and his [...] "New Deal." [...] Burnham argued that over a comparatively short period, which he dated from the first world war, a new society had emerged in which a [...] "social group or class" [...] which Burnham called [...] "managers" [...] had engaged in a [...] "drive for social dominance, for power and privilege, for the position of ruling class." [...] For {{at least a decade}} previous to Burnham's book, the idea of a [...] "separation of ownership and control" [...] of the modern corporation had been part of American economic thought, with Burnham citing The Modern Corporation and Private Property by Berle and Means as an important exposition. Burnham expanded upon this concept, arguing that whether ownership was corporate and private or statist and governmental, the essential demarcation between the ruling elite (executives and managers on the one hand, bureaucrats and functionaries on the other) and the mass of society was not ownership so much as it was control of the means of production.|$|E

A former smith from Poltava, Kulesh worked together with Centurashvili. At this time, Centurashvili was only one month away from being discharged from the camp (...) And suddenly he surprisingly disappeared. The wardens <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> hills, stated Kulesh's evidence, that last time Kulesh had seen his workmate near the fireplace, Kulesh went out to work and Centurashvili left to warm himself more; but when Kulesh returned to the fireplace, Centurashvili had vanished; who knows, maybe he got frozen somewhere in snow, he was a weak guy (...) The wardens searched for two more days, and then assumed {{that it was an}} escape case, though they wondered why, since his imprisonment period was almost over (...) The crime was there. Approaching the fireplace, Kulesh killed Centurashvili with an axe, burned his clothes, then dismembered him and hid the pieces in snow, in different places, putting specific marks on each burial place. ... Just yesterday, one body part was found under two crossed logs.|$|E

And the Great Spirit speaks to me {{sometimes}} since I have been here. [...] When I {{was in the}} Great Spirit Lodge (Westminster Abbey) where the kings are buried, I laid my face upon my hands. [...] The words of the preacher I did not know, but they sounded like the softy winds through a leafy forest and my eyelids were heavy. [...] Then I heard soft music and sweet voices, and a great cloud came down towards me, and when it nearly touched me, it opened and I saw {{in a blaze of}} light the girls with wings and they beckoned me. [...] And I was so certain that what I saw was that, I called out to my young men who were with me ‘Come and see what this is,’ and the young men replied, “You have been dreaming.’ But what I saw was true, for when I <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> great lodge afterwards, I saw on the walls the same girls with wings as I saw in my dreams. [...] Our people will wonder at these things, when we return to the Native Reservation and tell them what we have seen.” ...|$|E
