50|$|Between 1832 and 1840 <b>golden</b> <b>honey</b> {{coloured}} sandstone was quarried from {{locations in}} the Queens Domain and Salamanca Place (now the site of Salamanca Square), and a small railway was constructed to ferry the blocks to the construction site. Construction began in on 5 January 1835, and using mostly convict labour, the basement level had been completed by March 1836. By 1838 the second story had been added and the building was ready for staff of the Customs Department to move into on 1 September 1840.|$|R

50|$|The Droughtmaster breed emerged. Other British breeds — mainly Hereford — {{have since}} been used in its {{development}} {{to arrive at a}} fixed tropical breed of approximately 50% Bos indicus and 50% Bos taurus genetics. Droughtmasters are medium to large with good walking and foraging abilities coupled with lower nutritional requirements to give them the ability to retain condition and keep breeding, irrespective of the prevailing conditions. Their short coat is generally red in colour, although variations from <b>golden</b> <b>honey</b> to dark red can occur. The red pigmentation in Droughtmasters helps protect the cattle from cancer eye, sunburnt udders and photosensitisation. The cattle may be polled or horned, but the vast majority are polled and exhibit only a moderate hump. They have medium to large ears and an extended dewlap.|$|R

5000|$|The {{styles of}} {{commercials}} {{have changed over}} the years. In the early 1980s, commercials mostly featured adults talking about the cereal and how good and healthy it is. During {{a majority of the}} 1980s and 1990s, commercials would mainly be about Buzz trying to tempt someone with a bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios. They would refuse, but Buzz would not give up; he would eventually tell them that the cereal contains real <b>golden</b> <b>honey</b> and crunchy nuts/wholegrains, and the consumer would respond, [...] "Did you say honey and nuts?", and have the cereal. Commercials in the late 1990s voiced by Andrew Morris, would be about Buzz coming into a classic fairy tale and do the same thing he's always done in the past. Commercials in the 2000s contain animated adventures about Buzz and his friends outsmarting villains trying to steal all the honey in the hive. Most recently, commercials have been featured in CGI. In 2013, Buzz was given a [...] "swag makeover" [...] by Nelly.|$|R

40|$|A semiempirical {{constitutive}} {{model for the}} visco-elastic rheology of bubble suspensions with gas volume fractions &phis; < 0. 5 and small deformations (Ca << 1) is developed. The model has its theoretical foundation in a physical analysis of dilute emulsions. The constitutive equation {{takes the form of}} a linear Jeffreys model involving observable material parameters: the viscosity of the continuous phase, gas volume fraction, the relaxation time, bubble size distribution and an empirically determined dimensionless constant. The model is validated against observations of the deformation of suspensions of nitrogen bubbles in a Newtonian <b>liquid</b> (<b>golden</b> syrup) subjected to forced oscillations. The effect of &phis; and frequency of oscillation f on the elastic and viscous components of the deformation are investigated. At low f, increasing &phis; leads to an increase in viscosity, whereas, at high f, viscosity decreases as &phis; increases. This behaviour can be understood in terms of bubble deformation rates and we propose a dimensionless quantity, the dynamic capillary number Cd, as the parameter which controls the behaviour of the system. Previously published constitutive equations and observations of the rheology of bubble suspensions are reviewed. Hitherto apparently contradictory findings can be explained as a result of Cd regime. A method for dealing with polydisperse bubble size distributions is also presented. ...|$|R
60|$|In Ursula {{the sense}} of the unrealised world ahead triumphed over everything. In the midst of this {{profound}} darkness, there seemed to glow on her heart the effulgence of a paradise unknown and unrealised. Her heart was full of the most wonderful light, <b>golden</b> like <b>honey</b> of darkness, sweet like the warmth of day, a light which was not shed on the world, only on the unknown paradise towards which she was going, a sweetness of habitation, a delight of living quite unknown, but hers infallibly. In her transport she lifted her face suddenly to him, and he touched it with his lips. So cold, so fresh, so sea-clear her face was, it was like kissing a flower that grows near the surf.|$|R
60|$|Over this chamber, which {{contained}} what his soul longed after, {{and over the}} president's rooms, there ran a set of unoccupied garrets, into which the dexterous Cartouche penetrated. These were divided from the rooms below, according to the fashion of those days, {{by a set of}} large beams, which reached across the whole building, and across which rude planks were laid, which formed the ceiling of the lower story and the floor of the upper. Some of these planks did young Cartouche remove; and having descended by means of a rope, tied a couple of others to the neck of the honey-pots, climbed back again, and drew up his prey in safety. He then cunningly fixed the planks again in their old places, and retired to gorge himself upon his booty. And, now, see the punishment of avarice! Everybody knows that the brethren of the order of Jesus are bound by a vow to have no more than a certain small sum of money in their possession. The principal of the college of Clermont had amassed a larger sum, in defiance of this rule: and where do you think the old gentleman had hidden it? In the honey-pots! As Cartouche dug his spoon into one of them, he brought out, besides a quantity of <b>golden</b> <b>honey,</b> a couple of golden louis, which, with ninety-eight more of their fellows, were comfortably hidden in the pots. Little Dominic, who, before, had cut rather a poor figure among his fellow-students, now appeared in as fine clothes as any of them could boast of; and when asked by his parents, on going home, how he came by them, said that a young nobleman of his schoolfellows had taken a violent fancy to him, and made him a present of a couple of his suits. Cartouche the elder, good man, went to thank the young nobleman; but none such could be found, and young Cartouche disdained to give any explanation of his manner of gaining the money.|$|R
500|$|Clotted {{cream is}} an {{essential}} part of a cream tea, a favourite with tourists particularly in Cornwall and Devon. It is served on scones—or the more traditional [...] "splits" [...] in Cornwall—with strawberry jam (other flavours are generally less acceptable), along with a pot of tea. Traditionally, there are differences in the way it is eaten in each county: in Devon, the cream is traditionally spread first on the scone, with the jam dolloped on top. In Cornwall the jam is spread first with a dollop of cream. Cream teas, known as Devonshire Teas, spread to southern Australia as early immigrants from Cornwall and Devon took their traditional recipes with them. In 2010, Langage Farm in Devon started a campaign for [...] "Devon cream tea" [...] to have protected designation of origin similar to [...] "Cornish clotted cream". One variation on a cream tea is called [...] "Thunder and Lightning" [...] which consists of a round of bread topped with clotted cream and <b>golden</b> syrup, <b>honey,</b> or treacle.|$|R
50|$|Obama nungara is a {{medium-sized}} land planarian with a lanceolate body, being up to 70 mm long. The background {{color of the}} dorsum varies from <b>golden</b> yellow to <b>honey</b> yellow and is covered by dark-brown to black spots and flecks aggregated in short and irregular longitudinal streaks, giving it a light to dark-brown marbled appearance. A fine line devoid of brown pigmentation usually runs lingitudinally along {{the middle of the}} dorsum, sometimes having a diffuse dark border formed by concentration of the brown pigmentation.

6000|$|We had {{the first}} watch from eight to midnight. The wind was soon blowing half a gale, and our sailing-master {{expected}} little sleep that night as he paced {{up and down the}} poop. The topsails were soon clewed up and made fast, then the flying jib run down and furled. Quite a sea was rolling by this time, occasionally breaking over the decks, flooding them and threatening to smash the boats. At six bells we were ordered to turn them over and put on storm lashings. This occupied us till eight bells, when we were relieved by the mid-watch. I was the last to go below, doing so just as the watch on deck was furling the spanker. Below all were asleep except our green hand, the [...] "bricklayer," [...] who was dying of consumption. The wildly dancing movements of the sea lamp cast a pale, flickering light through the fo'castle and turned to <b>golden</b> <b>honey</b> the drops of water on the yellow oilskins. In all the corners dark shadows seemed to come and go, while up in the eyes of her, beyond the pall bits, descending from deck to deck, where they seemed to lurk like some dragon at the cavern's mouth, it was dark as Erebus. Now and again, the light seemed to penetrate for a moment as the schooner rolled heavier than usual, only to recede, leaving it darker and blacker than before. The roar of the wind through the rigging came to the ear muffled like the distant rumble of a train crossing a trestle or the surf on the beach, while the loud crash of the seas on her weather bow seemed almost to rend the beams and planking asunder as it resounded through the fo'castle. The creaking and groaning of the timbers, stanchions, and bulkheads, as the strain the vessel was undergoing was felt, served to drown the groans of the dying man as he tossed uneasily in his bunk. The working of the foremast against the deck beams caused a shower of flaky powder to fall, and sent another sound mingling with the tumultous storm. Small cascades of water streamed from the pall bits from the fo'castle head above, and, joining issue with the streams from the wet oilskins, ran along the floor and disappeared aft into the main hold.|$|R
