The optical fiber is electrically non-conductive, {{so it does}} not act as an antenna to pick up electromagnetic signals.

It is attached by high tension steel cables so that no light is obstructed by traditional glazing bars.|$|E
40|$|Under the {{conditions}} of industrial capitalism, competition contributed to the concentration of industry.

Concentration of means of production reduces administrative expenses, expenditures for heating, <b>lighting,</b> <b>transmission</b> mechanisms, etc. This, however, is accompanied by aggravation of the contradictions of capitalist production.

25|$|The {{effects of}} {{sediment}} on aquatic wildlife {{vary with the}} species {{and the amount of}} contamination. High sediment levels can kill fish directly, bury spawning beds, reduce <b>light</b> <b>transmission,</b> alter temperature gradients, fill in pools, spread streamflows over wider, shallower areas, and reduce production of aquatic organisms used as food by other species. These changes destroy the habitat of valued species, and may enhance habitat for less-desirable species. Existing conditions are already marginal for some freshwater fish in the United States, and the sedimentation of their habitat may result in their extinction. The heaviest sediment pollution of a drainage normally comes within 5 to 25 years after mining. In some areas, unvegetated spoil piles continue to erode even 50 to 65 years after mining.|$|E
2500|$|Polycarbonate is {{a durable}} material. [...] Although it has high impact-resistance, it has low scratch-resistance. Therefore, a hard coating {{is applied to}} {{polycarbonate}} eyewear lenses and polycarbonate exterior automotive components. The characteristics of polycarbonate compare to those of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA, acrylic), but polycarbonate is stronger and will hold up longer to extreme temperature. Polycarbonate is highly transparent to visible light, with better <b>light</b> <b>transmission</b> than many kinds of glass.|$|E

40|$|Microflow {{photochemistry}} {{has recently}} {{emerged as a}} new methodology that successfully combines flow operation, micro-space and activation by light ('lab & light on a chip'). Numerous micro-photoreactors for micro-scale synthesis to technical-scale production have been already developed. The main advantages of microflow photoreactors are their beneficial <b>light</b> <b>transmissions,</b> controlled exposure times, accurate temperature control and removal of photoproducts from the irradiated area. These operation features commonly result in higher yields, enhanced selectivity, improved energy efficiencies and reductions of solvent volumes and subsequently waste. This review highlights selected examples of microflow photochemical reactors and transformations of pharmaceutical interest.

2500|$|Ignoring {{differences}} in <b>light</b> <b>transmission</b> efficiency, a lens {{with a greater}} f-number projects darker images. [...] The brightness of the projected image (illuminance) relative to {{the brightness of the}} scene in the lens's field of view (luminance) decreases with the square of the f-number. Doubling the f-number decreases the relative brightness by a factor of four. [...] To maintain the same photographic exposure when doubling the f-number, the exposure time would need to be four times as long.|$|E
2500|$|Emission theory, {{also called}} emitter theory or {{ballistic}} theory of light, was a competing theory {{for the special}} theory of relativity, explaining {{the results of the}} Michelson–Morley experiment of 1887. Emission theories obey the principle of relativity by having no preferred frame for <b>light</b> <b>transmission,</b> but say that light is emitted at speed [...] "c" [...] relative to its source instead of applying the invariance postulate. Thus, emitter theory combines electrodynamics and mechanics with a simple Newtonian theory. Although there are still proponents of this theory outside the scientific mainstream, this theory is considered to be conclusively discredited by most scientists.|$|E

[...] Expanding relativity to cases of accelerating reference frames (the [...] "general theory of relativity") in the 1910s, Einstein posited an equivalence between the inertial force of acceleration and the force of gravity, leading {{to the conclusion that}} space is curved and finite in size, and the prediction of such phenomena as gravitational lensing and the distortion of time in gravitational fields.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{retardation}} regime of doped graphene plasmons, {{given by the}} nominal crossing of the unretarded plasmon and light-cone. In addition to modifications in the plasmon dispersion relation, retardation implies strong coupling between propagating light and matter, even for homogeneous graphene, which opens up the possibility of efficient plasmonics in simple graphene devices. We exemplify this enhancement in a double-layer configuration that exhibits perfect (if lossless) <b>light</b> <b>transmissions</b> across a classically forbidden region, providing a simpler analog of the corresponding phenomenon in perforated metal sheets. We also show that (broad) Fabry-Pérot resonances present without graphene turn into sharply peaked, quasi-discrete modes {{in the presence of}} graphene where graphene's response function is given by the typical Fano lineshape.
