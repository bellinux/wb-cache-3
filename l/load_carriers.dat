50|$|A {{pivoting}} link, {{such as a}} carabiner, is used {{to secure}} the load to the trolley so that the trolley {{does not have a}} tendency to rock and thus fall off the cable if the load should sway. <b>Load</b> <b>carriers</b> ranging from enclosed cabins to gondolas to harnesses are attached to the link. Occasionally the load carrier is just a handhold or handlebar, although there is the danger of the rider's losing his grip and falling.

50|$|During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, Ranjit Singh (then a Major) led the 1st Para team {{to capture}} the {{strategic}} Haji Pir pass (which was later handed over to Pakistan after the Tashkent Agreement). According to the original plan prepared by Harbaksh Singh, the then General-Officer-Commanding-in-Chief of the Western Army Command, the Army was to capture Rustan and Badori (or Bedori) {{on the way to}} the Haji Pir pass. Ranjit Singh's unit was tasked with capturing Sank, Sar and Ledwali Gali to stop the enemy infiltration. However, the attack on Sank on the night of 25/26 August was unsuccessful, resulting in 18 casualties. Ranit Singh's paratroopers captured Sank on the night of 26/27 August, and Point 1033 the next day. Meanwhile, four attacks on Rustan and Badori by other battalions had proved unsuccessful. Ranjit Singh then volunteered {{to capture the}} Haji Pir pass, and his battalion took over the operation on 27 August. The unit moved along the Hyderabad nullah with only damp shakarparas and biscuits as field ration. Ranjit Singh's paratroopers were fired upon by the Pakistani Army, but were saved by an unexpected shower. They subsequently captured some Pakistani soldiers from a house during the trek, took over their weapons and used them as <b>load</b> <b>carriers</b> for rest of the journey to the pass. The unit launched the final assault on the pass on 28 August, walking up 4,000 feet on foot. The attack was successful, as the Pakistan troops retreated from the pass. Ranjit Singh Dyal was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra for this operation.|$|E
50|$|From {{the arrival}} of James Cook in 1769 and {{especially}} Marion Du Fresne's longer stay in New Zealand in 1772, Māori were able to obtain iron and steel which {{did not exist in}} pre contact Māori culture. Māori quickly learned the superiority of this material, especially for carving. Māori learnt to ask sailors to sharpen 8 inch long ships nails to a chisel point on a ships wheel in exchange for fish. This period between 1779 and 1820 - the height of the musket wars, has been called the golden age of Māori wood carving Much of the carving was confined to waka taua. During the middle 19th century, from 1835, {{the arrival of}} large numbers of European settlers and ships meant that ship's boats were far more commonly available and were increasingly used by Māori in preference to waka. In 1839 100 ships visited The Bay of Islands. This was a trend that the missionaries such as Marsden and Williams had noted had begun in the 1830s. The beamier, lighter, ship's boat was better <b>load</b> <b>carriers</b> with more stability and was sometimes equipped with sails for windward sailing. Use of shipsboats became common as many Māori worked {{on a wide variety of}} sealing, whaling and trading sailing vessels,both in New Zealand and in the Pacific. During the Land Wars few waka were used for movement of warriors as when the Waikato campaign started in 1863 the government forces made a point of sinking all the waka they could find on the Waikato River and its tributaries to slow rebel communications. Later, some fine examples of these waka were placed in the Auckland War Memorial Museum.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} perspectives {{as to what}} is actually considered LTL. Full Truck <b>Load</b> <b>carriers</b> can put anywhere from 2 to 6 different people's shipments on a trailer and since each shipment is technically “less than a truckload” they would consider that to be LTL. There are also freight companies who do not specialize in truck loads, but rather, consolidate larger volume shipments from about 2 to 12 pallets (or about 4000 to 24000 pounds) and consider themselves LTL Carriers. Finally, the most commonly referenced LTL is shipped via “common” carriers who handle freight above what would normally ship via FedEx Ground, or UPS or U.S. Mail parcel services (about 150 pounds) to just under what would usually be considered a Truck Load at about 20,000 pounds or more than 14 pallets. LTL common carriers {{are also more likely to}} accept loose (non-palletized) cargo than the other two. LTL shipments typically weigh between 151 and 20000 lb. Less than Truckload carriers use [...] "hub and spoke" [...] operations where small local terminals are the spokes ('end of line') and larger more central terminals are the hubs (also called Distribution Centers or DC's). Spoke terminals collect local freight from various shippers and consolidate that freight onto enclosed trailers for transporting to the delivering or hub terminal where the freight will be further sorted and consolidated for additional transporting (also known as linehauling). In most cases, the end of line terminals employ local drivers who start the day by loading up their trailers and heading out to make deliveries first. Then when the trailer is empty they begin making pickups and return to the terminal for sorting and delivery next day. Because of the efficiency of this order of operations most deliveries are performed in the morning and pickups are made in the afternoon.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- In {{the field}} of {{transport}} logistics, the planning of routes is usually executed centrally. However, current trends in transport logistics exhibit higher degrees of dynamics and complexity. Central algorithms are not adequate in handling these new challenges. Therefore, new solutions are required. Within this context, the Distributed Logistics Routing Protocol (DLRP) for the autonomous and decentralized routing in transport logistic networks has been developed. In previous work, two types of logistic entities have been integrated within the DLRP, transport vehicles and transport goods. In order to evaluate {{the performance of the}} DLRP in scenarios, which are closer to reality, <b>load</b> <b>carriers</b> are integrated into the DLRP as a new type of logistic entities. <b>Load</b> <b>carriers</b> can be applied as supporting components for the transport of goods. Within this work, the concept of the integration of <b>load</b> <b>carriers</b> is presented. Furthermore, the influences of the integration are investigated. For that, different scenarios are generated, which enable the comparison with simulations without integrated <b>load</b> <b>carriers.</b> Key-Words:- Autonomous control- Distributed logistics routing protocol (DLRP) – Transport logistics – Routing algorithm – <b>Load</b> <b>carriers...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background. Long-term Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) {{monitoring}} for potentially life-threatening posttransplant {{lymphoproliferative disorder}} (PTLD) has identified asymptomatic patients who maintain high EBV loads over long periods. Methods. Thirty-one pediatric liver transplant recipients were designated as 11 chronic high EBV <b>load</b> <b>carriers</b> (EBV DNA level 15000 copies/mL of whole blood for 16 months) and 20 control recipients. Serial quantification of EBV DNA, measurement of interleukin 10 (IL- 10) concentrations, EBV-specific tetramer staining, and relative quantification of EBV gene expression in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} were performed. Results. Most of the chronic high EBV <b>load</b> <b>carriers</b> were seronegative at transplant, the median time to resolution of a chronic high EBV load was 23 months, and no recipient developed late-onset PTLD. EBV DNA was detected predominantly in CD 19 + cells. The plasma concentration of IL- 10 and the EBV-specific CD 8 + cell frequency {{did not differ}} significantly between the chronic high EBV <b>load</b> <b>carriers</b> and the control recipients. Analysis of gene expression showed that EBV-encoded small RNA 1, BamHI A rightward transcripts, and latent membrane protein 2 were positive in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from chronic high EBV <b>load</b> <b>carriers.</b> Conclusions. EBV-infected cells in the blood of chronic high EBV <b>load</b> <b>carriers</b> expressed a highly restricted set of latency genes, suggesting that the EBV-infected cells escaped from a T cell response...|$|E
