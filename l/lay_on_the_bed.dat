25|$|Later Krishna told Arjuna how {{he could}} bring down Bhishma, through the help of Sikhandhi. The Pandavas were {{initially}} not agreeable to such a ploy, as by using such cheap tactics {{they would not be}} following the path of Dharma, but Krishna suggested a clever alternative. And thus, on the next day, the tenth day of battle Shikhandi accompanied Arjuna on the latter's chariot and they faced Bhishma who put his bow and arrows down. He was then felled in battle by Arjuna, pierced by innumerable arrows. Using Sikhandhi as a shield, Arjuna shot arrows at Bhishma, piercing his entire body. Thus, as was preordained (Mahadeva's boon to Amba that she would be the cause of Bhishma's death) Shikhandi, that is, Amba reincarnated was the cause of Bhishma's fall. As Bhishma fell, his whole body was held above the ground by the shafts of Arjuna's arrows which protruded from his back, and through his arms and legs. Seeing Bhishma lying on such a bed of arrows humbled even the gods who watched from the heavens in reverence. They silently blessed the mighty warrior. When the young princes of both armies gathered around him, inquiring if there was anything they could do, he told them that while his body <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> of arrows above the ground, his head hung unsupported. Hearing this, many of the princes, both Kaurava and the Pandava alike brought him pillows of silk and velvet, but he refused them. He asked Arjuna to give him a pillow fit for a warrior. Arjuna then removed three arrows from his quiver and placed them underneath Bhishma's head, the pointed arrow tips facing upwards. To quench the war veteran's thirst, Arjuna shot an arrow into the earth, and a jet stream of water rose up and into Bhishma's mouth. It is said that Ganga herself rose to quench her son's thirst.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of the awards, Herman turned on his radio and sat in his bedroom chair. Sara <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> As the {{screenplay}} category approached, he pretended to be hardly listening. Suddenly from the radio, half screamed, came [...] "Herman J. Mankiewicz." [...] Welles's name as coauthor was drowned out by voices all through the audience calling out, [...] "Mank! Mank! Where is he?" [...] And audible above all others was Irene Selznick: [...] "Where is he?" ...|$|E
2500|$|On 21 July 1928, Terry {{died of a}} {{cerebral}} haemorrhage at her home at Smallhythe Place, near Tenterden, Kent, aged 81. Her son Edward later recalled, [...] "Mother looked 30 years old ... a young beautiful woman <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> like Juliet on her bier". Margaret Winser created a death mask. Terry was cremated at Golders Green, Middlesex. [...] Her ashes are kept in a silver chalice {{on the right side}} of the chancel of the actors' church, St Paul's, Covent Garden, London, where a memorial tablet was unveiled by Sir John Martin-Harvey.|$|E
60|$|He patted 'im <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{shoulder}} agin, and Sam, arter fidgeting about a bit, went out. The {{last time}} he ever see Peter's uncle he was <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> with 'is eyes shut, smiling in his sleep. And Peter Russet didn't see Sam for eighteen months.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I tell you, Thomas, she {{has left}} the clothes which she wore in her room; and more {{extraordinary}} still, there is the black wig which I have observed she wore <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> It is most singular and looks like a deep plot of some sort or other." ...|$|R
60|$|My comrades awakened {{very shortly}} {{afterward}} like lads {{who have had}} their fill of slumber, and we <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> trying {{for at least the}} twentieth time to get some glimmer of an idea regarding the strange doings of the night before, as well as questioning whether it might not be possible for us to learn whether Master Lord was at home.|$|R
60|$|My uncle <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> His {{face was}} deadly white and awfully haggard. He {{held out his}} hand.|$|E
60|$|Edwards <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> with wide-open {{eyes staring}} at the intruders. Mr. Wells sat with bowed head. Zeisberger calmly whittled a stick, and Jim stood bolt upright, with a hard light in his eyes.|$|E
60|$|She {{followed}} the woman upstairs. William <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> with bloodshot eyes, his face rather discoloured. The clothes were tossed about, {{there was no}} fire in the room, {{a glass of milk}} stood on the stand at his bedside. No one had been with him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I flit from {{branch to}} branch," [...] {{continued}} Hewet. [...] "The world is profoundly pleasant." [...] He <b>lay</b> back <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> upon his arms.|$|R
60|$|Her {{friends were}} sorry, but {{could do nothing}} to help her; so Dorothy went to her own room and <b>lay</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and cried herself to sleep.|$|R
6000|$|... "Did {{you notice}} {{how long it}} was," [...] I asked, [...] "from {{the time when you}} <b>lay</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> to <b>the</b> time when you found {{yourself}} awake again?" ...|$|R
60|$|He stopped. He thought. He {{held his}} head. He {{went over to}} the {{stationary}} bowl and soaked his hair with water. He <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and kicked his heels, slowly and gravely smoothing his mustache. Fifty minutes later he gave a portentous groan and went to bed.|$|E
60|$|While he <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> flat, {{his arms}} out, like a {{prisoner}} on a rack, wondering why all his thoughts {{had become a}} void in which he could find no words with which to answer her, she slowly stood up, turned out the gas, then again opened the gas-cock.|$|E
60|$|Harold {{had never}} touched liquor {{since the day}} of his child's death, nor spoken of it; but when his dying uncle begged him to watch over his young cousins, he took up the Bible that <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> and, unsolicited, took a solemn oath to taste nothing of the kind {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5000|$|The next morning, Lorna (Lina Esco) speaks {{negatively}} of women, {{motherhood and}} weddings {{and how much}} she enjoys being alone and that she's independent while smoking a cigarette. She hears the couple next door arguing and yells through the wall at them, telling the husband to stop being [...] "a little bitch" [...] and stating the wife is a hypocrite for being a feminist but wanting her sexual needs fulfilled. Lorna <b>lays</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> saying she has ways to numb the pain, with Tove laying with her. The two fornicate, cuddle and smoke marijuana together <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> (Influence).|$|R
60|$|He looked dreadfully pitiful as he <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> great <b>bed,</b> a huge, bloated, old man; but so wan, so weak, it was heart-rending. As he rested, {{his mind}} {{seemed to grow}} clearer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind, I can undress in the dark. I'm used to it." [...] She {{loosened}} {{the collar}} of her dress, slipped off her shoes, and <b>lay</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> bitter and rebellious.|$|R
60|$|Karenin <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> with a {{soft white}} rug about him, and Fowler, who was to be his surgeon {{sat on the edge}} of the bed and talked to him. An {{assistant}} was seated quietly in the shadow behind the bed. The examination had been made, and Karenin knew what was before him. He was tired but serene.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Papa,' {{she said}} on one {{occasion}} to the fine, red-faced, handsome man of forty, who, puffing and fizzing like a bursting bottle, <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> wrapped in a dressing-gown, {{and every now and}} then enunciating, in spite of himself, about one letter of some word or words that were almost oaths; 'papa, will you not come downstairs this evening?' She spoke distinctly: he was rather deaf.|$|E
60|$|And {{then all}} were gone, and the mourners {{went back to}} the place which should know her no more; and Marie's room was darkened, and she <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> sobbing and moaning in {{uncontrollable}} grief, and calling every moment for the attentions of all her servants. Of course, they had no time to cry,--why should they? the grief was her grief, and she was fully convinced that nobody on earth did, could, or would feel it as she did.|$|E
60|$|So he {{did what}} the Princess had told him. He walked {{straight}} in between the lions just {{as if he did}} not see them, and then into the small chamber, and <b>lay</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|R
60|$|Her wings would {{scarcely}} {{carry her}} now, but in reply she alighted {{on his shoulder}} and gave his chin a loving bite. She whispered in his ear 'You silly ass'; and then, tottering to her chamber, <b>lay</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|R
60|$|Stella {{closed the}} door and looked at her cousin thoughtfully. She had evidently been busy packing. Dresses and hats <b>lay</b> about <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> and in <b>the</b> next room the maid was busy {{emptying}} the cupboards. Stella closed the communicating door.|$|R
60|$|The child <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> in {{her little}} summer frock, her face very white now after the shock, Nurse had come {{carrying}} the youngest child: and little Annabel stood holding her skirt. Winifred, terribly serious and wooden-seeming, was bending over the knee, from which she had taken his blood-soaked handkerchief. Egbert bent forward, too, keeping more sangfroid in his face than in his heart. Winifred went all of a lump of seriousness, {{so he had to}} keep some reserve. The child moaned and whimpered.|$|E
60|$|He now {{began to}} tell himself that out of evil cometh good. His {{encounter}} with the elusive Mr. Moon had not been an agreeable one, but it had had this solid advantage, that it had left him {{right in the middle}} of a great many clothes. And Mr. Moon, whatever his moral defects, had the one excellent quality of taking about the same size as himself. Archie, casting a covetous eye upon a tweed suit which <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> was on the point of climbing into the trousers when on the outer door of the studio there sounded a forceful knocking.|$|E
60|$|Kalaua nodded, {{went out}} once more, {{and closed the}} door softly behind him. They both seated {{themselves}} as far as I could guess, on chairs in the sitting-room. Oh, how I longed to hear the rest of their conversation! It was quite irresistible. Curiosity got the better of my native prudence. I couldn't catch a word of what they were saying with any distinctness where I <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> I must rise and listen. I undid the splints that bound up my leg; crawled carefully across the room without jerking or hurting it; and throwing myself down at the bedroom door, bent eagerly though cautiously down to the key-hole.|$|E
6000|$|Her wings would {{scarcely}} {{carry her}} now, but in reply she alighted {{on his shoulder}} and gave his nose a loving bite. She whispered in his ear [...] "You silly ass," [...] and then, tottering to her chamber, <b>lay</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|R
60|$|After {{considerable}} discussion Neal {{was made}} to understand that no good could come of posting sentinels, and the little party <b>lay</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> of leaves; but, owing to the suspense concerning {{the fate of the}} others, neither slept very soundly.|$|R
60|$|The boys nodded, {{and taking}} their caps ran off, while Gervaise, tired by the {{excitement}} of <b>the</b> day, <b>lay</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> which a servant brought up {{a few minutes after}} they had left him, and slept soundly until their return.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{just the}} same, deary," [...] the woman said, and taking down a key she {{unlocked}} the door, and Sophy saw her little room quite unchanged, and looking {{exactly as it}} did when she slept there last, twelve years before. Her little drawings hung on the wall, the elaborate sampler she had worked when quite a child, was in its frame in its old place over the mantle. Not a speck of dirt was visible anywhere, and a sweet scent of rosemary and lavender filled the room. Everything was {{just as she had}} left it; the white coverlid <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> which needed only its sheets to be ready for sleeping in.|$|E
60|$|Joe {{was delighted}} with the laundry. Everything was settled, and he would enter into {{possession}} next day. Martin <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> with closed eyes, while the other talked on. Martin's thoughts were far away--so far away that he was rarely {{aware that he was}} thinking. It was only by an effort that he occasionally responded. And yet this was Joe, whom he had always liked. But Joe was too keen with life. The boisterous impact of it on Martin's jaded mind was a hurt. It was an aching probe to his tired sensitiveness. When Joe reminded him that sometime in the future they were going to put on the gloves together, he could almost have screamed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, I <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> and {{the wind}} drew in from the sea and just lifted the window-curtain, and I could see the sea shining and hear the waves making a {{pleasant}} little dash, and then my head seemed to swim. I thought I was walking out by the pleasant shore, and everything seemed so strangely beautiful, and grandpapa and grandmamma were there, and Moses had come home, and you were there, {{and we were all}} so happy. And then I felt a sort of strange sense that something was coming--some great trial or affliction--and I groaned and clung to Moses, and asked him to put his arm around me and hold me.|$|E
6000|$|Could John {{have heard}} what the poor girl was moaning to herself {{at that moment}} as she <b>lay</b> writhing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> he would have doubted her mother's assurance. 'If he had been dead I could have borne it, but this I cannot bear!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, yes," [...] {{his mother}} said. [...] "You did right, Joey. And you're a good boy, and--Joey dear,"--and she {{rose from the}} bench where she was sitting with him--"I believe I'll go and <b>lay</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> a minute. Bein' up, so--" ...|$|R
60|$|One evening about six, {{after coming}} in from a long walk about town, Albert entered his room without {{lighting}} his lamp, <b>lay</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> and fell asleep. He had been out late the night before with Maud at a party, and slumber came almost instantly.|$|R
