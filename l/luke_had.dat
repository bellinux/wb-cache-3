Percy soon learns that <b>Luke</b> <b>had</b> used the entrance and will lead his army through the Labyrinth straight in {{to the heart of}} camp. To get into the Labyrinth, Percy has to find the symbol of Daedalus, the Greek letter delta, (Δ) on a passageway, touch it, and then enter the Labyrinth. Using the Labyrinth, Percy tries to find Daedalus so Luke cannot get Ariadne's string, thereby foiling Luke's invasion.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{up to the}} 2009 NHL Entry Draft, Schenn {{had been}} listed as the third highest {{prospect}} among WHL players in the NHL Central Scouting Service (CSS)'s preliminary rankings, while International Scouting (ISS) ranked him at fifth overall and first in the WHL. Schenn's ranking remained the same at fifth overall with the NHL CSS's midway ranking. E. J. McGuire, the director of NHL's Central Scouting Bureau compared facets of Schenn's game to Jonathan Cheechoo and Joe Thornton. At the 2009 NHL Entry Draft, he managed to be drafted in the exact same amateur selection position his brother <b>Luke</b> <b>had</b> two years earlier, as he was drafted fifth overall by the Los Angeles Kings.|$|E
5|$|On January 3, 2014, Kesha {{checked into}} Timberline Knolls Residential Treatment Center, a rehab {{facility}} in Lemont, Illinois, for eating disorder treatment. Kesha's mother Pebe Sebert {{confirmed that the}} eating disorder Kesha was suffering with is bulimia nervosa {{and that she had}} been struggling with it since she was signed. She also alleged that Dr. Luke was partly the cause of Kesha's eating disorder, saying that <b>Luke</b> <b>had</b> allegedly told her to lose weight after he signed her, comparing the shape of her body to a refrigerator. Sebert asserted that this had caused Kesha's disorder to worsen. Kesha had completed her treatment on March 6, 2014, after spending two months in rehab.|$|E

25|$|An {{animated}} {{version of}} the show called The Dukes aired in 1983 and produced by Hanna-Barbera. The first season fell under the Coy and Vance era of the live-action show and thus they were adapted into animated form.

Luckily for Jim and Luke, the former Mrs. Grindtooth awakes as a Golden Dragon of Wisdom in China and can help them out with information and tells Jim how {{to find out about}} his origin. With the help of the Mandalanese emperor, Jim and Luke – and Princess Li Si as a stowaway – start their journey to meet the Wild 13 and rescue Molly. They encounter the pirates, who prove to be too much for them in battle. Molly is lost at sea, and all but Jim are captured and brought to the pirates' base, Castle Stormeye, a pinnacle of rock within the eye of a perpetual hurricane.|$|E
25|$|On patrol, Han and Chewbacca {{discover}} the meteor <b>Luke</b> <b>had</b> planned to investigate {{is actually a}} probe droid, which alerts the Empire to the Rebels’ location. The Empire launches a large-scale attack, using AT-AT Walkers to capture the base. Despite great resistance, the Walkers destroy the base's shield generator and force the Rebels to retreat. Han and Leia escape on the Millennium Falcon with C-3PO and Chewbacca, but the hyperdrive malfunctions. They hide in an asteroid field, where Han and Leia grow closer and eventually kiss. Vader summons bounty hunters, including the notorious Boba Fett, to assist in finding the Falcon. Luke, meanwhile, escapes with R2-D2 in his X-wing fighter and crash-lands on the swamp planet Dagobah. He meets a diminutive creature who reveals himself to be Yoda; after conferring with Obi-Wan's spirit, Yoda reluctantly accepts Luke as his student. Yoda trains Luke as a Jedi, and raises his sunken ship from the swamp {{with the power of}} the Force, after Luke claims it to be impossible.|$|E
25|$|Acts {{was read}} as a {{reliable}} history of the early church well into the post-Reformation era. By the 17th century, however, biblical scholars began to notice that it was incomplete and tendentious—its picture of a harmonious church is quite at odds with that given by Paul's letters, and it omits important {{events such as the}} deaths of both Peter and Paul. The mid-19th-century scholar Ferdinand Baur suggested that <b>Luke</b> <b>had</b> re-written history to present a united Peter and Paul and advance a single orthodoxy against the Marcionites. (Marcion was a 2nd-century heretic who wished to cut Christianity off entirely from the Jews). Baur continues to have enormous influence, but today there is less interest in determining Luke's historical accuracy (although this has never died out) than in understanding his theological program. In How Jesus Became Christian Canadian religious historian Barrie Wilson has renewed Baur's charge that Acts is a work of historical revisionism whose main purpose was to link Paul's new and separate Christ religion to Jesus and Judaism.|$|E

500|$|In 2005, Lukasz Gottwald (Dr. <b>Luke)</b> <b>had</b> just {{finished}} producing tracks for Kelly Clarkson's album Breakaway (2004) {{and was looking}} to expand further on his writing and producing credits. Luke solicited around to different people {{in the music business}} asking for demos from unknown artists. Two of the demos he received were from Katy Perry and Kesha. He was particularly taken with Kesha's demos which consisted of a self-penned country ballad and trip-hop track. The latter of the demos caught Luke off guard when she ran out of lyrics and started to rap, [...] "I'm a white girl/From the 'Ville/Nashville, bitch. Uhh. Uhhhhh." [...] The improvisation made her stand out from other artists that <b>Luke</b> <b>had</b> listened to, which he recalled: [...] "That's when I was like, 'OK, I like this girl's personality. When you're listening to 100 CDs, that kind of bravado and chutzpah stand out." [...] Following this, at the age of eighteen, Kesha signed to Luke's label, Kemosabe Records, and his publishing company, Prescription Songs.|$|E
500|$|... "Dirty Picture" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Taio Cruz, {{in collaboration with}} Fraser T Smith. While creating the track Cruz stated that he originally had wanted American singer Lady Gaga to feature on the track alongside himself. Following a meeting with Dr. Luke, Cruz agreed to switch to then upcoming singer Kesha. <b>Luke</b> <b>had</b> been working with Kesha and Cruz found Kesha's voice to be distinctive and opted to switch to her featuring on the track. Cruz commented on his decision, stating: [...] "I was thinking about Lady Gaga at first, then I went to a meeting with Dr. Luke and {{he was telling me}} about this new girl he was working with. She hadn't done 'Tik Tok' or anything like that at that point. But I just thought she sounded really cool. A very unique-sounding voice. I like that with artists, that as soon as you hear them on a song on the radio, you know immediately who that is without having to be told. She looked really sexy, and I just thought she was talented. Her voice was awesome. It had this — I hope she won't mind me saying this, but her voice has this kind of yodely quality to it, the way that she does things and the way that she ends words. I just loved that quality about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Soap Opera Digest {{columnist}} Carolyn Hinsey {{stated that}} she was at her Indiana University sorority house when the wedding took place.

[...] "The relationship had creepy overtones, given that <b>Luke</b> <b>had</b> raped Laura two years earlier, and yet it captured the imagination." ...|$|E

2500|$|... 1887 {{began with}} Short's younger brother, Henry Jenkins Short, killing {{a man named}} Charles T. Schuyler at San Angelo, Texas on January 23. San Angelo, 200 miles {{south-west}} of Fort Worth, was the town where Short's parents {{and other family members}} lived. Initial reports indicated that Schuyler was shot twice, the bullets entering his back and coming out at the front, either one of which would have been fatal. Henry Short fled to Fort Worth, before he could be arrested, to enlist the aid and funds that his brother Luke could provide for his defense. Luke and Henry returned to San Angelo on January 29, and Henry voluntarily surrendered to the sheriff and gave bond for his appearance in the district court. The money that would be needed to defend Henry Short would have to be provided by Luke, who had already put up the money for Henry's bond. In addition, <b>Luke</b> <b>had</b> at the time some unrelated but very expensive legal problems of his own looming in the Dallas court. The amount that would be needed to handle all of these legal issues was more than <b>Luke</b> <b>had</b> on hand. In order to raise the needed funds, Johnson agreed to purchase Luke Short's one-third interest in the White Elephant on February 7, 1887. The press informed the public that Short had no intention of leaving town [...] "but will continue to call Fort Worth home." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1657, Josias visited England, {{and in his}} absence, he {{appointed}} Dr. Luke Barber, Sr. (c. 1615–1668) to administer the government. [...] <b>Luke</b> <b>had</b> been the household physician of Oliver Cromwell, the Lord Protector. [...] Fendall returned February 26, 1658, and brought back an agreement from Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore (1605–1675). [...] This agreement stated {{that the government was}} definitely restored to the proprietor, Governor Fendall, as well as a new commission curtailing his power as [...] governor, with Philip Calvert (1626–1682), a younger brother of Cecil, as advisor. [...] As a result of reading the Articles of Agreement from Lord Baltimore on March 23, Capt. William Fuller and the other commissioners formally surrendered the Provisional Government to Josias Fendall.|$|E
2500|$|Lucas {{completed}} a second draft of The Star Wars in January 1975, making heavy simplifications and introducing the young hero {{on a farm}} as Luke Starkiller. Annikin became Luke's father, a wise Jedi knight. [...] "The Force" [...] was also introduced as a mystical energy field. This second draft still had some differences from the final version in the characters and relationships. For example, <b>Luke</b> <b>had</b> several brothers, {{as well as his}} father, who appears in a minor role {{at the end of the}} film. The script became more of a fairy tale quest as opposed to the action-adventure of the previous versions. This version ended with another text crawl, previewing the next story in the series. This draft was also the first to introduce the concept of a Jedi turning to the dark side: the draft included a historical Jedi who became the first to ever fall to the dark side, and then trained the Sith to use it. Impressed with his works, Lucas hired conceptual artist Ralph McQuarrie to create paintings of certain scenes around this time. When Lucas delivered his screenplay to the studio, he included several of McQuarrie's paintings.|$|E

2500|$|From this, Thurston {{was able}} to kick to Billy Slater, setting up the first four-pointer which Thurston also {{converted}} to make the score 8–2. A try attempt by Cooper Cronk was controversially [...] disallowed by the video referee, who ruled Isaac <b>Luke</b> <b>had</b> been able to stop the ball coming {{into contact with the}} in-goal grass while also giving New Zealand a penalty against Andrew Fifita for 'driving' Luke. Cronk didn't have to wait long to score though, as a few minutes later Darius Boyd got around Whare and raced down the wing before putting in a miss-kicked grubber which Cronk managed to find to go over and score despite a desperate Kevin Locke tackle. Thurston kicked his 3rd goal from 3 attempts to take the score out to 14–2. Thurston's conversion of Cronk's try saw him overtake Michael Cronin as Australia's highest point scorer in test match football. Manu Vatuvei's attacking run for New Zealand saw him pushed over the sideline 5 metres out by 5 desperate Australian defenders, and an offside penalty at the 35 minute mark gave Thurston another kick to bring the score out to 16–2 at halftime.|$|E
2500|$|In the story, Lucky {{comes across}} Elizabeth Webber (Herbst) after {{she has been}} raped, and confides his upset to his father before his hostile {{half-brother}} Nikolas Cassadine (then Christopher) reveals to him that <b>Luke</b> <b>had</b> raped Laura years prior. The betrayal Lucky feels from having the truth kept from him has a drastic impact on the character, especially because of how close he had been with his parents. Having moved around often, their relationship had become more like best friends than parent-child. Lucky struggles to understand his parents' actions. Jackson described Lucky in 1999 as: [...] "a black-and-white personality. He either loves or hates people. He doesn't know about balance." [...] Lucky's relationship with each of his parents suffers; he thinks his mother is in denial about her attack, and is even more angry with his father for keeping the secret while Lucky was coping with Elizabeth's assault. Lucky moves out and his independence grows further as he crashes at various places around Port Charles while holding odd jobs and continuing his schoolwork. As {{a result of the}} ordeal, honesty becomes important to Lucky; Jackson explained to Soap Opera Digest in December 1998: [...] "He doesn't want to do what his parents did as far as keeping secrets from each other and lying. He's pretty set on doing things differently {{when it comes to the}} decisions he makes in his life." ...|$|E
2500|$|T.I. had {{recorded}} 20 songs for the album in April 2009 {{and said that}} the recording style of the album would be a mix of writing his lyrics down and free-styling. In December 2009, former Warner Music Group executive, Kevin Liles, posted a message on his Twitter saying that T.I. was recording new material for a new album. Jim Jonsin told Rap-Up that [...] "It doesn't seem like he missed a beat." [...] On May 25, 2010, T.I. stated that he recorded 80 songs for the album. Jason Geter said that T.I. has been in the studio with Lil' C, DJ Toomp, Danja, The Runners and TrackSlayerz. He also said that much of the album's production would come from new producers. In an interview with Vibe, the production duo, TrackSlayerz, confirmed that they recorded three songs with T.I., including [...] "I'm Back". DJ Toomp confirmed that he had already worked three songs with T.I. and plans to record two more. Vibe reported that Swizz Beatz has been contributing production to the album. Hip-hop DX reported that Drumma Boy will contribute to the project as well. Just Blaze revealed that he contributed four beats to the project.
