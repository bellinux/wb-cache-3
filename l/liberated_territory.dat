5|$|In mid-May, Operation Trio was {{followed}} by the joint Italian-Chetnik offensive against Partisan detachments within the Italian zone of occupation in eastern Herzegovina and Montenegro, with similar effects: the Partisans lost almost all of the <b>liberated</b> <b>territory</b> in these areas. This offensive is also considered part of the Third Enemy Offensive in Yugoslav historiography. After Operation Trio, NDH forces remained south of the demarcation line between the German and Italian zones of occupation, in spite of protests from the Italians.|$|E

Emir Faisal became in charge of administering the <b>liberated</b> <b>territory.</b> He appointed Rida al-Rikabi as prime minister, and Quwatli's friend, Nasib al-Bakri became a personal adviser to the Emir. Quwatli, at the age of twenty-six, was appointed assistant to the governor of Damascus, Alaa al-Din al-Durubi.|$|E
500|$|The Partisan {{movement}} in Yugoslavia, aside from some smaller territories, established a large <b>liberated</b> <b>territory</b> extending {{west of the}} rivers Neretva and Bosna, {{in the direction of}} the cities of Zagreb and Rijeka. The Partisan force had grown stronger – it had more than 60,000 armed fighters in this so-called [...] "Tito's State" [...] who were both well trained and supported by artillery. On 20 January 1943, the German HQ in Yugoslavia launched an offensive codenamed Case White (...) , intending to regain the lost territory. The attack was supported by aircraft from the Luftwaffe, Regia Aeronautica and the ZNDH. Aircraft from the 2nd and 3rd Groups from Sarajevo and the 6th Group from Banja Luka were involved in bombing raids as well as leaflet dropping missions.|$|E

30|$|With the ceasefire agreement, the Polisario Front also assumed {{political}} {{control over the}} Eastern, inland areas of the Western Sahara (Bhatia [2001]), the so-called <b>liberated</b> <b>territories</b> (approximately 20 % of the Western Sahara)c while the remaining ‘occupied territories’ are under the Moroccan Government’s administrative authority. Pastoral areas within the <b>liberated</b> <b>territories</b> {{are important to the}} refugees’ struggle to maintain or recover traditional cultural and social practices, from livestock husbandry to medicinal plant use (Volpato et al. [2012]), as well as to generate income, e.g. through the sale of desert truffles (Volpato et al. [2013 b]). Some 20 to 30, 000 Sahrawi who remained nomadic throughout the war by moving with their herds to safe areas in neighbouring Mauritania and Mali also reoccupied these territories after 1991, herding their livestock and using the refugee camps and Zouérat (in Mauritania) as their main commercial hubs. Today, camel husbandry is practiced in the <b>liberated</b> <b>territories</b> as well as, to a lesser extent, in the areas surrounding the refugee camps. About 2, 000 camels are raised in the camps, whereas some 40, 000 are raised in the <b>liberated</b> <b>territories</b> (DNV-RASD [2007]). Furthermore, the Polisario own and tend some 27, 000 camels in the <b>liberated</b> <b>territories,</b> where soldiers or paid labourers act as shepherds (Broglia and Volpato [2008]). In refugee camps, camel owners supplement natural forage with fodder purchased in Tindouf. In contrast, nomads (full-time and seasonal) practice extensive camel husbandry in the <b>liberated</b> <b>territories,</b> that is, husbandry that is highly dependent on pasture areas and mobility for herd production and reproduction.|$|R

50|$|The {{resistance}} movement against Axis occupation {{was started in}} summer of 1941 by the communists. The resistance in Banat and Bačka was soon defeated, while resistance in Syrmia had more success. The Syrmian {{resistance movement}} grew into a popular uprising, and a large <b>liberated</b> <b>territory</b> (that included about 40 villages) was established in Syrmia. On <b>liberated</b> <b>territory,</b> a partisan authority was organized, which included mass anti-fascist organizations, publishing activity, and education. The experiences of the resistance movement in Syrmia were transferred to Banat and Bačka {{in the summer of}} 1944; before the Soviet Red Army arrived in October 1944, Vojvodina already had its new institutions of people's administration. The liberation movement was organized into 18 Vojvodinian brigades divided into 3 squadrons. 15,000 fighters of the resistance movement were killed during the liberation struggle.|$|E
30|$|The {{recovery}} of camel husbandry is ongoing {{in the refugee}} camps of the Hamada and in the <b>liberated</b> <b>territories</b> where refugees travel and nomads live. The Hamada is a barren desert plateau known historically as the ‘Devil’s Garden’ because rainfall is scarce and edaphic conditions are poor, which explains why it has very poor forage resources, few trees, no halophytic plants and few annuals. Across the <b>liberated</b> <b>territories,</b> the climate is also arid and continental, with summer daytime temperatures surpassing 50 °C, while winter temperatures drop to zero at night. In the territories, rain generally occurs {{from the end of}} the summer through autumn. Average annual rainfall is 30 to 50  mm; however, rains are highly irregular both within and between years, and droughts are recurrent. But, in comparison with the Hamada, the <b>liberated</b> <b>territories</b> and especially the northern area, called Zemmur, are richer in biodiversity and forage plants. After the rains, they display a savannah-like environment dominated by Acacia trees, and flowering prairies may appear in flat gravel areas.|$|R

30|$|Besides enjoying {{milk and}} {{meat in the}} camps, some {{refugees}} move seasonally with their livestock to the <b>liberated</b> <b>territories</b> where they consume these products. Some move to fatten livestock, purchasing small livestock and camels before heading for the badiya. One family bought about 300 goats and sheep and 40 camels which were sold upon return to the camps; {{in at least two}} cases, this system was embedded in the camel trade destined to supply meat to the camps - camels are bought in Mauritania or Mali, brought to the <b>liberated</b> <b>territories</b> where she-camels provide milk for seasonal nomadic refugees, males are fattened and, {{at the end of the}} period, sold to butchers in the camps.|$|R
50|$|The Uprising in Serbia was {{initiated}} in July 1941 by the Communist Party of Yugoslavia against the German occupation forces and their Serbian quisling auxiliaries in the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia. At first the Yugoslav Partisans had mounted diversions and conducted sabotage and had attacked representatives of Aćimović's quisling administration. In late August some Chetniks joined the uprising and liberated Loznica. The uprising soon reached mass proportions. Partisans and Chetniks captured towns that weak German garrisons had abandoned. The armed uprising soon engulfed great {{parts of the}} occupied territory. The largest <b>liberated</b> <b>territory</b> in occupied Europe {{was created by the}} Partisans in western Serbia, and was known as the Republic of Užice. Rebels shared power on the liberated territory; the center of the Partisan <b>liberated</b> <b>territory</b> was in Užice, and Chetniks had their headquarters on Ravna Gora.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the May 1942 a large number of significant members of Partisans from Belgrade, went to the <b>liberated</b> <b>territory</b> in Bosnia, where the Supreme headquarters of the Partisans were located.

30|$|The Sahrawi's {{traditional}} pastoral territory {{was almost}} inaccessible to pastoralists while engulfed in war from 1975 to 1991 but, since then, the ‘liberated’ {{areas have been}} key to the re-emergence of camel husbandry and camel-related practices among refugees as they provide grazing resources for refugees’ and nomads’ herds, {{as well as a}} place for nomads to live and refugees to move in seasonal or ‘holiday’ nomadism. Refugees’ use of the <b>liberated</b> <b>territories</b> and northern Mauritania (where the Sahrawi have free informal access) for pasturing herds is informed by an economic rationale related to the emergent markets for livestock and livestock products in the refugee camps, as camel herds spend fallow or fattening periods in free-grazing conditions in these regions. This is especially the case for refugees with larger herds: in milk enterprises, fallow she-camels are grazed in the <b>liberated</b> <b>territories</b> as long as forage plants are available (after rains) to ‘keep them healthy with good forage’ and save the cost of feeding them in the camps on cut fodder. In meat enterprises, especially after rains, refugee herders use the <b>liberated</b> <b>territories</b> to fatten camels and small livestock before selling or slaughtering them in the camps.|$|R
