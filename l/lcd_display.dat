5|$|The HTC First is a {{mid-range}} smartphone {{which uses}} a dual-core, 1.4GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor with support for LTE, a 2000 mAh battery, 1 GB of RAM and 16 GB of non-expandable storage. The First uses a 4.3-inch 720p Super <b>LCD</b> <b>display,</b> and includes a 5-megapixel rear-facing camera, and a 1.6-megapixel front-facing camera. The HTC First's exterior uses a rounded, minimal design with three capacitive buttons below its screen, and was available in black, light blue, red, and white color finishes.|$|E
5|$|The {{smartphone}} considerably reduces its predecessor's sizes, measuring 4.3 by 2.4 by 6 inches (10.92, 6.09 and 15.24 centimeters, respectively). The Bold 9700 has a 624MHz {{processor and}} a 256MB Flash memory. The device uses a 2.44 inch HVGA (approximately 6.1cm) non-touch <b>LCD</b> <b>display</b> at {{a resolution of}} 480×360 pixels. The resolution of the display was {{compared to that of}} HTC Magic, as it has also HVGA quality. The model changes its predecessor's trackball to an optical trackpad, with simple functionalities such as swiping the thumb to move it and press it to make a selection. This change prevented problems including the accumulation of dust behind the trackball. Similarly to previous BlackBerry models, BlackBerry 9700 has a 35-key QWERTY-type physical keyboard, which is smaller than that of Bold 9000. On the top of the device, there are two buttons that respectively lock or mute it; {{on the right side of}} it, rubberized keys are found, which can either control the audio volume or the music player; further down, there is a camera shutter key. Cosmetic changes including the addition of a leatherette battery cover were carried out in order to appeal both sexes.|$|E

40|$|A self-assembled Fmoc-peptide {{hydrogel}} {{has been}} interfaced with a liquid crystal (<b>LC)</b> <b>display</b> {{to give an}} optical sensor for enzyme activity. An Fmoc-TL-OMe hydrogel was selected {{as it can be}} formed in situ by enzyme-mediated assembly with thermolysin, and undergoes enzyme-mediated diassembly upon subtilisin addition. This enzyme-responsive hydrogel provides a semi-rigid, highly hydrated and biocompatible environment that also holds the <b>LC</b> <b>display</b> in place. A dual layer design was developed, where a phospholipid-loaded upper gel layer was separated from the <b>LC</b> <b>display</b> by a phospholipid free lower layer. Subtilisin (0. 15 mM) digested both layers to give a gel-to-sol transition after several hours that liberated the phospholipid and produced a light-to-dark optical change in the <b>LC</b> <b>display.</b> The optical response was dependent upon the gel-to-sol transition; elastase or common components of serum did not disassemble the Fmoc-TL-OMe hydrogel and did not give an optical response...|$|R

40|$|We {{developed}} {{a simple and}} versatile imprinting technique {{in combination with the}} exposure of ultraviolet light to fabricate several patterned optical wave plates using a polymerizable liquid crystalline (PLC) material. One of such patterned PLC films, produced by imprinting, can be used as both an in-cell retarder and 10 an alignment layer for liquid crystal (<b>LC)</b> <b>display</b> applications. The chain ordering of the PLC molecules produced during imprinting results in anisotropic surface forces to align the LC molecules on the patterned PLC film without any surface treatment. A transflective <b>LC</b> <b>display</b> adopting an imprinted PLC film as an in-cell patterned retarder is demonstrated in a twisted nematic geometry. 15 Keywords: imprinting technique; in-cell patterned retarder; liquid crystal (LC); polymerizable liquid crystalline (PLC) material; transflective <b>LC</b> <b>display</b> (LCD) 1...|$|R

Notable interior features in the LRX included ambient interior lighting that changed according to Terrain Response settings, and vehicle data which was presented to the driver through a ‘floating’ three-dimensional <b>LCD</b> <b>display.</b> An aluminium centre console with an iPhone docking station stretched the length of the cabin, separating the four seats and the tailgate. Seats with open frameworks were used to give the impression of an airy interior while also creating useful under-seat and under-floor stowage areas. Electric motors folded the rear seats forward providing enough room for two mountain bikes to be fitted upright, with front wheels removed and stored in dedicated slots in the floor.|$|E
25|$|Nearly all DAPs {{consists}} {{of some kind}} of display screen, although there are exceptions, such as the iPod Shuffle, and a set of controls with which the user can browse through the library of music contained in the device, select a track, and play it back. The display, if the unit even has one, can be anything from a simple one or two line monochrome <b>LCD</b> <b>display,</b> similar to what are found on typical pocket calculators, to large, high-resolution, full-color displays capable of displaying photographs or viewing video content on. The controls can range anywhere from the simple buttons as are found on most typical CD players, such as for skipping through tracks or stopping/starting playback to full touch-screen controls, such as that found on the iPod Touch or the Zune HD. One of the more common methods of control is some type of the scroll wheel with associated buttons. This method of control was first introduced with the Apple iPod and many other manufacturers have created variants of this control scheme for their respective devices.|$|E

40|$|A large display can be {{constructed}} in two different ways: 1. a rectangular grid, or tiling, of many small screens with seams, or bezels, at the boundaries between the screens and 2. one large screen with no bezel inside the screen. The first way costs significantly less than the second way. However, the first way creates a discontinuity in the image because of the bezels, and this discontinuity may impact a user's performance. There are two different ways to implement the first, tiling way of constructing a large display: 1. tiled, multiple projections onto one large screen and 2. tiling of actual <b>LC</b> <b>displays.</b> With the first way, bezels are avoidable, but there is the necessity of continuous, precise coordination of multiple projectors. With the second way, once the displays are mounted, no coordination is necessary, but bezels are unavoidable. While it might seem preferable to avoid bezels and incur higher construction or coordination costs, {{the reality is that}} if no user's performance is negatively affected by bezels, then there is no reason not to use the cheaper methods of constructing large displays. Therefore, the aim {{of this study is to}} determine how bezels affect a user's task performance. We conducted two controlled experiments in order to determine - how varying the width of bezels affects a user's performance; - how varying the number of bezels affects a user's performance; and - how the choice between tiled, multiple projections and tiling of actual <b>LC</b> <b>displays</b> affects a user's performance. In each experiment, the participants solved a puzzle within a given time. The findings from this study are that user performance is not affected by variation in the width of bezels and by variation in the number of bezels. However, the tiling of actual <b>LC</b> <b>displays</b> is better for user performance than tiled, multiple projections. Therefore, it is more acceptable to use a rectangular grid of actual <b>LC</b> <b>displays</b> to implement a large display...|$|R
