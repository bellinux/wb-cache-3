He simply thrusts a few oil jars into the valley of diamonds, and so fulfils the promise held out by the hoardings to the public eye. I have adapted this simple device to our occasion by thrusting into my perfectly modern three-act play a totally extraneous act in which my hero, enchanted by {{the air of the}} Sierra, has a dream in which his Mozartian ancestor appears and philosophizes at great length in a Shavio-Socratic dialogue with the lady, the statue, and the devil.|$|E
40|$|BOUNDPACK is {{a package}} for {{computing}} solutions of boundary value problems (BVP). At this moment BOUNDPACK contains routines to compute solutions of two-point linear BVP for non-stiff problems, which {{are described in}} the first chapter. The routines are designed for either general boundary con-ditions (BC),(the routines DHUTSG and SMUTSG for respectively double preci-sion and single precision computation), separated BC, (the routines Dl 4 UTSS and SMUTSS) or partially separated BC, (the routines DMUTSP and SMUTSP). The manual is designed {{in such a way}} that both the user who only <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how <b>to</b> call the routines and the user who <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> about the method should find his way through the following decription. The first user may restrict himself to § 1 and § 5 and also might consult 9 4 if more in-formmation is needed. The present routines not only try to compute the desired solution accurate-ly, but also aim at a reliable diagnosis when the computation encounters difficulties. In any case (also if no problems are reported) the routines deliver useful stability constants of the problem. It is our intension to extend BOUNDPACK in the near future with routines for other specific cases. Comments and reports about the present routines are very much welcomed...|$|R

6000|$|It is {{the opinion}} of some Italian critics that Italian demoralization began with the {{reaction}} against Luther, when the Jesuits rose to supreme power in the Church and gathered the whole education of the young {{into the hands of}} the priests. Cesare Cantù, whose book on Parini ed il suo Secolo may be read with pleasure and instruction by such as <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> fully the time of which I speak, was of this mind; he became before his death a leader of the clerical party in Italy, and may be supposed to be without unfriendly prejudice. He alleges that the priestly education made the Italians literati rather than citizens; Latinists, poets, instead of good magistrates, workers, fathers of families; it cultivated the memory at the expense of the judgment, the fancy at the cost of the reason, and made them selfish, polished, false; it left a boy [...] "apathetic, irresolute, thoughtless, pusillanimous; he flattered his superiors and hated his fellows, in each of whom he dreaded a spy." [...] He knew the beautiful and loved the grandiose; his pride of family and ancestry was inordinately pampered. What other training he had was in the graces and accomplishments; he was thoroughly instructed in so much of warlike exercise as enabled him to handle a rapier perfectly and to conduct or fight a duel with punctilio.|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} {{honestly}} {{say that the}} stations or the people about them were more interesting than in La Mancha. But at one place, where some gentlemen in linen jackets dismounted with their guns, {{a group of men}} with dogs leashed in pairs and saddle-horses behind them, took me with the sense of something peculiarly native where everything was so native. They were slim, narrow-hipped young fellows, tight-jerkined, loose-trousered, with a sort of divided apron of leather facing the leg and coming to the ankle; and all were of a most masterly Velasquez coloring and drawing. As they stood smoking motionlessly, letting the smoke drift from their nostrils, they seemed somehow of the same make with the slouching hounds, and they leaned forward together, giving the hunters no visible or audible greeting, but questioning their will with one quality of gaze. The hunters moved toward them, but not as if they belonged together, or expected any sort of demonstration from the men, dogs, and horses that were of course there to meet them. As long as our train paused, no electrifying spark kindled them to a show of emotion; {{but it would have been}} interesting to see what happened after we left them behind; they could not have kept their attitude of mutual indifference much longer. These peasants, like the Spaniards everywhere, were of an intelligent and sagacious look; they only wanted a chance, one must think, to be a leading race.

Dim visions we still get of miraculous draughts of fishes, and heaps uncountable by the river-side, from the tales of our seniors sent on horseback in their childhood from the neighboring towns, perched on saddle-bags, with instructions to get the one bag filled with shad, the other with alewives. At least one memento of those days may still exist {{in the memory of}} this generation, in the familiar appellation of a celebrated train-band of this town, whose untrained ancestors stood creditably at Concord North Bridge. Their captain, a man of piscatory tastes, having duly warned his company to turn out on a certain day, they, like obedient soldiers, appeared promptly on parade at the appointed time, but, unfortunately, they went undrilled, except in the manuoevres of a soldier's wit and unlicensed jesting, that May day; for their captain, forgetting his own appointment, and warned only by the favorable aspect of the heavens, as he had often done before, went a-fishing that afternoon, and his company thenceforth was known to old and young, grave and gay, as [...] "The Shad," [...] and by the youths of this vicinity this was long regarded as the proper name of all the irregular militia in Christendom. But, alas! no record of these fishers' lives remains that we know, unless it be one brief page of hard but unquestionable history, which occurs in Day Book No. 4, of an old trader of this town, long since dead, which shows pretty plainly what constituted a fisherman's stock in trade in those days. It purports to be a Fisherman's Account Current, probably for the fishing season of the year 1805, during which months he purchased daily rum and sugar, sugar and rum, N. E. and W. I., [...] "one cod line," [...] "one brown mug," [...] and [...] "a line for the seine"; rum and sugar, sugar and rum, [...] "good loaf sugar," [...] and [...] "good brown," [...] W. I. and N. E., in short and uniform entries {{to the bottom of the}} page, all carried out in pounds, shillings, and pence, from March 25th to June 5th, and promptly settled by receiving [...] "cash in full" [...] at the last date. But perhaps not so settled altogether. These were the necessaries of life in those days; with salmon, shad, and alewives, fresh and pickled, he was thereafter independent on the groceries. Rather a preponderance of the fluid elements; but such is the fisherman's nature. I can faintly remember to have seen this same fisher in my earliest youth, still as near the river as he could get, with uncertain undulatory step, after so many things had gone down stream, swinging a scythe in the meadow, his bottle like a serpent hid in the grass; himself as yet not cut down by the Great Mower.|$|E

40|$|But, you may say, {{what is so}} {{questionable}} about everyday life? Does not everyday life, quite by definition, {{consists of}} that which is not questioned? It is a natural disposition of life, an unthinking repetition of routines, sheltered by the ordinariness of it all. Everyday life does not involve wandering {{in the fields and}} thinking about unusual things; the everyday is about the dull manage of a house. 1 Everyday life just is. Why ask questions? The subject of “ordinary everyday life”—or a lack of it—seems quite popular in media discussions. Experts on children’s upbringing recommend ordinary everyday life as the cure for children’s and young people’s illfare; that is, sitting on the sofa and watching telly, cooking, grocery shopping. Some experts claim that people are unable to cope with ordinary everyday life, and seek all kinds of breaks and experiences to colour up the grayness of their ordinary lives, which in turn leads to divorces and neglected children, among other things. On the other hand, the everyday appears more abundant than before, while many previously festive and rare things have become everyday matters: shopping, travelling, exotic foods, drinking wine with a meal or having clothes made of a fabric that does not make you itchy are all now ordinary rather than a luxury.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} information and clarity on {{the education system}} in {{the army of the}} Czech Republic, as well as its role and the reason why it is needed. The thesis also describes individual steps of this education system, including a system for life-long education. This document aims to provide basic information regarding the army of the Czech Republic, primarily the need for its existence and its tasks, but also its role in the world-wide context. Furthermore, it looks deeper into high-school and university education, as well as a vast life-long education system. The life-long education system covers an extensive offer from elementary to highly specialized courses. Additionally, the thesis tries to clarify potential career opportunities for soldiers leaving the army. The points stated above, such as the scope of this system, and life-long education, have become the major reasons why I have selected this theme. Last but not least, the thesis provides a constructive view of this education system, some of its challenges and new areas to explore. It provides an overview of all the education activities in the army.
