40|$|Carbon {{sequestration}} in sandstone saline reservoirs holds {{great potential}} for mitigating climate change, but its <b>storage</b> potential and <b>cost</b> per ton of avoided CO 2 emissions are uncertain. We develop a general model to determine the maximum theoretical constraints on both storage potential and injection rate {{and use it to}} characterize the economic viability of geosequestration in sandstone saline aquifers. When applied to a representative set of aquifer characteristics, the model yields results that compare favorably with pilot projects currently underway. Over a range of reservoir properties, maximum effective storage peaks at an optimal depth of 1600 m, at which point 0. 18 - 0. 31 metric tons can be stored per cubic meter of bulk volume of reservoir. Maximum modeled injection rates predict minima <b>for</b> <b>storage</b> <b>costs</b> in a typical basin in the range of $ 2 - 7 / ton CO 2 (2005 U.

Though efficient for low-cardinality attributes, query processing can be rather costly for high-cardinality attributes due to the large <b>storage</b> requirements <b>for</b> the bitmap indices. Binning {{is a common}} technique <b>for</b> reducing <b>storage</b> <b>costs</b> of bitmap indices.

Although binning may reduce <b>storage</b> <b>costs,</b> it may increase the access costs of queries that do not fall on exact bin boundaries (edge bins). For this kind of queries the original data values associated with edge bins must be accessed, in order to check them against the query constraints. In this paper we study the problem of finding optimal locations for the bin boundaries in order to minimize these access <b>costs</b> subject to <b>storage</b> constraints. We propose a dynamic programming algorithm for optimal partitioning of attribute values into bins that takes into account query access patterns as well as data distribution statistics. Mathematical analysis and experiments on real life data sets show that the optimal partitioning achieved by this algorithm can lead to a significant improvement in the access costs of bitmap indexing systems for high-cardinality attributes...|$|R

Noting that standard tools for random access (i. e., I-frame insertion) can be inefficient for this application, we propose a technique where redundant representations of some frames can be stored to facilitate view switching. We first present an optimal algorithm with exponential running time that generates such a frame structure so that the expected transmission rate is optimally traded off with total storage. We then present methods to reduce the algorithm complexity for practical use.

These tools will drastically reduce the required computing time and the <b>storage</b> <b>cost,</b> and, therefore, will allow us to consider much larger data sets or finer meshes. Covariance matrices are crucial in spatio-temporal statistical tasks, but are often very expensive to compute and store, especially in 3 D. Therefore, we approximate covariance functions by cheap surrogates in a low-rank tensor format. We apply the Tucker and canonical tensor decompositions to a family of Matern- and Slater-type functions with varying parameters and demonstrate numerically that their approximations exhibit exponentially fast convergence. We prove the exponential convergence of the Tucker and canonical approximations in tensor rank parameters. Several statistical operations are performed in this low-rank tensor format, including evaluating the conditional covariance matrix, spatially averaged estimation variance, computing a quadratic form, determinant, trace, loglikelihood, inverse, and Cholesky decomposition of a large covariance matrix. Low-rank tensor approximations reduce the computing and <b>storage</b> <b>costs</b> essentially. <b>For</b> example, the <b>storage</b> <b>cost</b> is reduced from an exponential O(n^d) to a linear scaling O(drn), where d is the spatial dimension, n is the number of mesh points in one direction, and r is the tensor rank.

With this new compression method we observe exponential efficiency gains as read lengths increase, and the magnitude of this efficiency gain can be controlled by changing the amount of quality information stored. Our compression method is tunable: The storage of quality scores and unaligned sequences may be adjusted for different experiments to conserve information or to minimize <b>storage</b> <b>costs,</b> and provides one opportunity to address the threat that increasing DNA sequence volumes will overcome our ability to store the sequences...|$|R
