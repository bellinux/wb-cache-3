We consistently treat the anisotropy of the ambient radiation field {{caused by the}} first scattering and also consider lowest order kinematic terms.

Its flow lines are the symplectic vortex equations on the cylinder. We prove a compactness theorem specific for functions containing a Lagrange multiplier which allows us to define the Conley indices of the flow on the finite dimensional approximations. We show that these Conley are given by the Thom space of the normal bundle of toric map space introduced by Givental in [9].

40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{show that}} a {{convolution}} semigroup {µt} of measures has Jacobi parameters poly-nomial in the convolution parameter t {{if and only if}} the measures come from the Meixner class. Moreover, we prove the parallel result, in a more explicit way, for the free convolution and the free Meixner class. We then construct the class of measures satisfying the same property for the two-state free convolution. This class of two-state free convolution semigroups has not been considered ex-plicitly before. We show that it also has Meixner-type properties. Specifically, it contains the analogs of the normal, Poisson, and binomial distributions, has a Laha-Lukacs-type characterization, and is related to the q = 0 case of quadratic harnesses. 1.
