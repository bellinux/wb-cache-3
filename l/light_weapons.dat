5|$|The Federal Government of Somalia was {{established}} in August/September 2012. On 6 March 2013, United Nations Security Council Resolution 2093 was passed. The resolution lifted the purchase ban on <b>light</b> <b>weapons</b> for a provisional period of one year, but retained restrictions on the procurement of heavy arms such as surface-to-air missiles, howitzers and cannons.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, {{the ship}} was rearmed with <b>light</b> <b>weapons</b> and was {{converted}} into a blockship and was then modified into a decoy with dummy gun turrets. Centurion {{was sent to the}} Mediterranean in 1942 to escort a convoy to Malta, although the Italians quickly figured out the deception. The ship was deliberately sunk during the Invasion of Normandy in 1944 to form a breakwater.|$|E
5|$|As {{a clandestine}} army {{operating}} in an enemy-occupied country, and separated by {{over a thousand}} kilometers from any friendly territory, the Home Army faced unique challenges in acquiring arms and equipment. It was able to overcome these difficulties to some extent and to field {{tens of thousands of}} armed soldiers. Nevertheless, the difficult conditions meant that only infantry forces armed with <b>light</b> <b>weapons</b> could be fielded. Any use of artillery, armor or aircraft was impossible (except for a few instances during the Warsaw Uprising, such as the Kubuś armored car). Even these light-infantry units were as a rule armed with a mixture of weapons of various types, usually in quantities sufficient to arm only a fraction of a unit's soldiers.|$|E
50|$|Tripods are {{generally}} restricted to heavier weapons where the weight {{would be an}} encumbrance. For <b>lighter</b> <b>weapons</b> such as rifles, a bipod is more common.|$|R

5|$|This {{meeting was}} between NATO leaders and {{president}} of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma. NATO members expressed appreciation for Ukraine’s contributions to NATO-led and other international peace support efforts such as KFOR. Ukraine also offered to support Operation Active Endeavour in the Mediterranean (a naval operation of NATO {{which is designed to}} prevent the movement of terrorists or weapons of mass destruction), an offer which NATO would consider. Defence cooperation between NATO and Ukraine was reviewed and the possible launching of a Partnership for Peace Trust Fund to help Ukraine destroy the surplus munitions, small arms and <b>light</b> <b>weapons</b> was discussed.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1919, Centurion {{had been}} {{transferred}} to the Mediterranean Fleet. Although she {{spent much of her}} time in reserve, she had a peripheral role in the Allied Intervention in the Russian Civil War. After her return home in 1924, the ship became the flagship of the Reserve Fleet. In 1926 Centurion was converted into a target ship and participated in trials evaluating the effectiveness of aerial bombing in addition to her normal duties. During the Second World War, the ship was rearmed with <b>light</b> <b>weapons</b> and was converted into a blockship in 1941. When that operation was cancelled, she was then modified into a decoy with dummy gun turrets in an attempt to fool the Axis powers. Centurion was sent to the Mediterranean in 1942 to escort a convoy to Malta, although the Italians quickly figured out the deception. The ship was deliberately sunk during the Invasion of Normandy in 1944 to form a breakwater.|$|E
5|$|Lepanto {{was removed}} from front-line service in 1902 and {{converted}} into a gunnery training ship; to aid in this task, the ship received a variety of <b>light</b> <b>weapons</b> that trainees {{would go on to}} use in the fleet. Italia was modernized in 190508, losing two of her funnels and several of her small-caliber guns; from 1909 to 1910, she served as a torpedo training ship. Both ships were reactivated in September 1911 after the outbreak of the Italo-Turkish War, initially assigned to the 5th Division. After the capture of Tripoli in October, Italia and Lepanto were sent to the city to provide gunfire support for the soldiers defending it. Lepanto was stricken from the naval register on 26 May 1912, before the war ended, but she was reinstated on 13 January 1913 as an auxiliary. She did not remain in service long, being stricken again on 27 March 1915 and broken up for scrap.|$|E
5000|$|Under {{the name}} fernbedienbare leichte Waffenstation (abbreviated with the acronym FLW) the German defence company Krauss-Maffei Wegmann brands its family of remote weapon stations. Fernbedienbare leichte Waffenstation stands for [...] "remotely operated, <b>light</b> <b>weapon</b> station".|$|R
50|$|The Academy also {{contains}} supporting {{services such as}} Security Company Command, <b>Light</b> <b>Weapon</b> Maintenance Unit, Photograph Studio, Service Company Command, Engineering - Maintenance Battalion Command, Communications Electronics and Information Systems Company Command, Band Command and Transportation Battalion Command.|$|R
50|$|Some years afterwards, NATO {{also agreed}} {{to move to a}} smaller round more {{suitable}} for full-automatic fire and <b>lighter</b> <b>weapons,</b> ultimately adopting the 5.56×45mm. Prior to committing to the 5.56mm, the British Army conducted additional intermediate cartridge research.|$|R
5|$|The revolt {{intensified}} after Essad's exile. In {{order to}} gain support from the 1,000 Mirdita Catholic paid volunteers from the northern mountains, Prince of Wied appointed their leader, Prênk Bibë Doda, as foreign minister. Isa Boletini and his men, mostly from Kosovo, also joined the International Gendarmerie to fight the rebels. Dutch gendarmes together with the Mirdita attempted to capture Shijak, but when they engaged on May23, they were surrounded and captured, along with another expedition from Durrës which attempted to release the captured gendarmes. Captain Sar {{did not know that}} the northern Catholic tribes refused to fight the rebels because General Besa was agreed when the Prince of Wied took over the throne. Rebels attacked Durrës, firing on it with <b>light</b> <b>weapons.</b> The people in Durrës panicked, and the Prince took his family to shelter in an Italian ship anchored in the bay.|$|E
25|$|Pohebits-quasho ("Iron Jacket") was a Comanche {{chieftain}} {{and medicine}} man whom the Comanche believed {{had the power}} to blow bullets aside with his breath. His name probably resulted from his habit of wearing a Spanish coat of mail into battle, which protected him from most <b>light</b> <b>weapons</b> fire.|$|E
25|$|Soviet {{thinking}} on the strategic scale was replaced since December 1962 with a people's war concept. The Soviet idea of direct warfare was replaced with a Maoist war of attrition strategy. Along with the mechanization of some infantry units, more emphasis was put on <b>light</b> <b>weapons,</b> high-angle indirect fire, night fighting, and sea denial.|$|E
50|$|In {{common with}} earlier patterns, the 1897 pattern was {{sometime}} produced in “picquet” weight, i.e., a <b>lighter</b> <b>weapon</b> with a narrower blade and correspondingly scaled-down guard {{for use in}} levées and other formal occasions when not on active service.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, man, be not so hot," [...] said Erling, with a {{smile that}} still more exasperated his companion; [...] "besides, is it fair to {{challenge}} me to fight with this <b>light</b> <b>weapon</b> while thou bearest a sword so long and deadly?" ...|$|R
50|$|A <b>light</b> <b>weapon</b> {{shall be}} {{lawfully}} acquired or possessed exclusively by the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the PNP and {{other law enforcement}} agencies authorized by {{the president in the}} performance of their duties. All firearms must be registered with the PNP.|$|R
25|$|Evidently, {{this was}} because of the coat of old Spanish mail the chief wore, which appears to have {{protected}} him from <b>light</b> <b>weapons</b> fire. In any event, he was a feared and dangerous figure along the Texas and Mexican border, and in the Comancheria in the decades leading up to the American Civil War.|$|E
25|$|Until March, Haganah {{suffered}} also {{a lack of}} arms. The Jewish fighters {{benefitted from}} a number of clandestine factories that manufactured some <b>light</b> <b>weapons,</b> ammunition and explosives. The one weapon of which there was no shortage was locally produced explosives. However, they had far less than what was necessary to carry out a war: in November, only {{one out of every three}} Jewish combatants was armed, rising to two out of three within Palmach.|$|E
25|$|According to Lapierre & Collins, on the ground, {{logistics}} {{were completely}} neglected, and their leader, Fawzi al-Qawuqji, envisaged that his troops survive {{only on the}} expenses accorded {{to them by the}} Palestinian population. However, Gelber says that the Arab League had arranged the supplies through special contractors. They were equipped with diffent types of <b>light</b> <b>weapons,</b> light and medium-sized mortars, a number of 75mm and 105mm guns, and armoured vehicles but their stock of shells was small.|$|E
50|$|The RPG-29 is a shoulder-launched, unguided, tube-style, breech-loading {{anti-tank}} rocket {{system with}} a range of 500 meters. The <b>light</b> <b>weapon</b> is designed to be carried and used by a single soldier. On the top of the launch tube is a 2.7×1P38 optical sight.|$|R
50|$|November 1969: The {{squadron}} {{began to}} develop the required training program for the <b>Light</b> Attack <b>Weapons</b> School. In December 1969 the squadron, in conjunction with VA-122, inaugurated a graduate level course for the <b>Light</b> Attack <b>Weapons</b> School that involved all phases of attack aviation.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{introduction}} of smaller and <b>lighter</b> <b>weapons</b> such as the Mk 15, as well as the pending retirement of the only aircraft capable of carrying them, the B-36, the Mk 24s were withdrawn by October 1956, with the Mk 17s withdrawn by August 1957.|$|R
25|$|On {{the night}} of the 15th the fourth company from the West Kents was landed and 170 German prisoners were taken to Samos. The Germans, on the other hand, landed an {{estimated}} 1,000 troops and artillery during that night. The defenders were left with only one tenth of their <b>light</b> <b>weapons,</b> and the German troops had reached the town of Leros and kept attacking the castle. Italian commanders asked Tilney to be allowed to have a more active part in the defense, but they were not listened.|$|E
25|$|Estonian {{military}} forces {{at the time}} consisted of 2,000 men with <b>light</b> <b>weapons</b> and about 14,500 poorly armed men in the Estonian Defence League. The end of November 1918 saw {{the formation of the}} Baltic Battalion, primarily a mounted machine-gun company plus infantry. Estonia's Baltic German minority provided a sizable troop of volunteer militia for the Battalion, {{which was one of the}} first fighting units of the Estonian Army, and maintained staunch loyalty to the authority of in the Republic. This contrasts with the Baltische Landeswehr in Latvia.|$|E
25|$|China has put {{its weight}} behind the {{conflict}} in Chad. The FUC rebellion, based in Sudan and aiming to overthrow the pro-Taiwan ruler of Chad, Idriss Déby, has received Chinese diplomatic support as well as <b>light</b> <b>weapons</b> and Sudanese oil. With Sudan maintaining a pro-Chinese stance, and Chad being pro-Taiwan (and since 2003, an oil producer), China has pursued their interests in replacing Deby with a more pro-China leader. The 2006 Chadian coup d'état attempt failed after French intervention, but Deby then switched his support to Beijing, with the apparent defeat becoming a strategic victory for China.|$|E

25|$|Following the Federation of Australia in 1901, Cerberus, {{like all}} other colonial naval ships, was {{transferred}} to the Commonwealth Naval Forces. This organisation was renamed the Royal Australian Navy in 1911, at which point, Cerberus was given the prefix HMAS. By 1909, Cerberus could not generate enough steam to propel herself. She was used as a guard ship and munitions storeship during World War I. When the Royal Australian Naval College was founded in 1913, its personnel were initially listed on the paybooks of Cerberus, as the college was not a commissioned establishment. By 1914, the monitor's main guns were inoperable, and she was reliant on her <b>light</b> <b>weapons</b> for defence.|$|E
25|$|Anti-tank guns {{deployed}} during World War II were {{manned by}} specialist infantrymen rather than artillery crews, and issued to light infantry units accordingly. The anti-tank guns of the 1930s were of small caliber; nearly all major armies possessing them used 37mm ammunition, {{except for the}} British Army, which had developed the 40mm Ordnance QF 2-pounder. As World War II progressed, the appearance of heavier tanks rendered these weapons obsolete and anti-tank guns likewise began firing larger and more effective armor-piercing shot. The development of the compact hollow charge projectile permanently altered anti-tank warfare, since this type of ammunition did not depend on a high muzzle velocity and could be fired from low-recoil, man-portable <b>light</b> <b>weapons</b> such as the Panzerfaust and the American series of recoilless rifles.|$|E
25|$|The {{chaos and}} revolts {{deteriorated}} after Essad Pasha was exiled. In {{order to gain}} support of the Mirdita Catholic volunteers from the northern mountains Prince of Wied appointed their leader, Prênk Bibë Doda, to be {{the foreign minister of}} the Principality of Albania. The International Dutch Gendarmerie was also joined by Isa Boletini and his men, mostly from Kosovo. Dutch gendarmes together with northern Mirdita Catholics attempted to capture Shijak, but when they engaged the rebels on May 23, they were surrounded and captured, as well as another expedition from Durres which attempted to release the captured gendarmes.
