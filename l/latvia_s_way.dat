In <b>Latvia</b> <b>S.</b> pennata is listed as ‘rare’ in the Red data book but still {{little is known about}} the species {{distribution}} in relation to habitat and substrate. A search of all available literature and unpublished records provided information on about 21 S. pennata records in Latvia from 1924 until 2010 from different habitats and substrates. In total 18 records of S. pennata were found from protected areas. The latest records suggest that it is more common in Woodland Key Habitats on Picea abies root mass, than on sandstone in Latvia. ...|$|R

His Syokuiku-Shokuyoho was based on his recognition that the human body including thoughts and emotions is a complex system with the organic connection between different parts of the body as well as the correspondence between the body and the environmental conditions within which it exists, that an integrated balance between sodium salts and potassium salts is the implicit background from which human beings fully develop, and that whole grains and vegetables should be the main food for human beings throughout their history. The Syokuiku-Shokuyoho was a health strategy for attaining an integrated balance both within the body and between the body and the world through adjusting the relationships of sodium salts and potassium salts in food. The Syokuiku-Shokuyoho reminded the Japanese of the significance of both the traditional medical system and the traditional food system.
