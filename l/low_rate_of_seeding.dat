50|$|Although ants {{can help}} {{facilitate}} the dispersal process, {{the soil in}} such watery environment is saturated and {{makes it difficult for}} ants to co-habitate with Helonias, lowering the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> short-distance <b>seed</b> dispersal. The <b>low</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> dispersal is also due to limited wind. The seeds are light enough to be dispersed by wind, but low levels of wind prevent the seeds from dispersing further away, resulting in a clustered population of Helonias.|$|R
50|$|The {{population}} of A. tanguticus {{is starting to}} dwindle in its main habitat of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China. This can be attributed {{not only to the}} effects of over-collection, as a medicinal species, but also to a <b>low</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> germination in A. tanguticus - even under most natural conditions. This is probably due to the relative impermeability of the testa <b>of</b> its <b>seeds</b> which tends to prevent water absorption and acts also to inhibit gaseous exchange.

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} seed production and predispersal hazards in a sand dune population of P. polyanthus (Eriocaulaceae) in Southern Brazil. Bad development of flowering capitula {{was caused by}} the wind and by interference among umbels. A positive correlation between the proportion of atrophied capitula and the number of capitula/umbels also suggested resource limitation. A caterpillar of a Recurvaria Haworth (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) species that eats flowers and a boring caterpillar (Lepidoptera not identified) were the main herbivores. Plants reproducing during the flowering peak had a lower probability of being damaged by Recurvaria sp., suggesting an escape from herbivores by flowering synchronism. The proportion of capitula damaged by herbivores was low, causing a reduction of about 5 % in the seed set/plant. The boring caterpillar may or may not cause umbel abortion. When the abortion occurs, seed production is reduced by 12 %. Many capitula with no damage and individual flowers (up to 50 %) did not produce seeds. Pollination failure could be related to this <b>low</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> set. We discuss the fact that the low recruitment of seedlings reported for populations of P. polyanthus {{did not seem to be}} limited by seed rain, which was estimated at an average of 8000 seeds/plant even when herbivore damage occurred...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The ecology <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> {{dispersal}} {{is critical}} to understand the patterns of distribution and abundance of plant species. We investigated seed dispersal aspects associated with the high abundance of Buchenavia tomentosa in the Serra Azul State Park (PESA). We estimated fruit production and conducted fruit removal experiments. We carried out diurnal and nocturnal observations on frugivory as well as germination tests. Fruiting occurred in the dry season and totaled 1, 365, 015 ± 762, 670 fruits. ha– 1. B. tomentosa fruits were utilized by eight animal species. The lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris) was considered the main seed disperser. Leafcutter ants (Atta laevigata and Atta sexdens) participated in the seed cleaning and occasionally dispersed seeds. The beetle Amblycerus insuturatus, blue-and-yellow macaw (Ara ararauna) and red-and-green macaw (Ara chloropterus) were considered pre-dispersal seed predators. The seeds manually cleaned presented higher germination rate (100 %) and speed index (4. 2 seeds. d– 1) than that <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> with pulp. Germination <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> found in tapirs’feces was 40 %, while for the seeds without pulp it was 25 %. The high abundance of B. tomentosa in the cerrado of PESA {{may be due to}} massive fruit production, <b>low</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> predation, and efficient seed dispersal by tapirs, occurring before the rains which promote germination and recruitment of this species...|$|R

Its propagation occurs via seeds or stem cuttings. The <b>low</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> germination makes the vegetative propagation a more efficient method. The presented work verified the influence of synthetic auxin application, indole butyric acid (IBA), in different concentrations, such as its application way, talc or solution, in the rooting of wisteria cuttings. With branches of stock plants, collected in November 2012, were made cuttings of approximately 10 cm length, 0. 5 cm diameter and with two leaves. After disinfection, {{the base of the}} cuttings were treated with: 0 mg L- 1; 1000 mg L- 1 and 2000 mg L- 1 via IBA in solution and, 0 mg kg- 1; 1000 mg kg- 1 e 2000 mg kg- 1 via IBA in talc. Vermiculite was the subtract used for all treatments. 63 days after the installation, the percentage of rooted cuttings was evaluated, live, with calluses and dead; the number of roots per cuttings and the length of the largest roots per cuttings. The best results were obtained with treated cuttings of 2000 mg kg- 1 (78. 75 % and 73. 75 % of rooting) therefore both ways of application of IBA are efficient towards the rooting induction.

40|$|Brown’s peony, Paeonia brownii (Paeoniaceae), {{is one of}} {{only two}} peony species native to the Western Hemisphere, yet its {{pollination}} ecology and breeding system have never been documented. Using flowering individuals of an endemic colony in the Blue Mountains of Oregon, U. S., we investigated the peony’s pollination system and floral function. We also examined pollen/carpel interactions through experimental pollinations aided by fluorescence microscopy. Paeonia brownii appears to be self compatible and mostly protogynous with floral traits of a generalist pollination system. The flowers appear to attract insects by producing abundant floral nectar secreted from lobes of a perigynous disc throughout their 9 - 15 -days of anthesis. The most common pollen vectors were wasp queens (Vespidae), the large flower fly Criorhina caudata (Syrphidae), and females of Lasioglossum spp. (Halictidae), all of which foraged exclusively for nectar. Whether collected from foraging wasps and flies, anthers, or stigmas, about half the pollen grains appeared fertile. The number of ovules per carpel was about 19. <b>Seed</b> set (seeds/ovule) <b>of</b> naturally pollinated flowers was about 20 % with about 4 viable seeds per follicle.

40|$|Seed {{predation}} {{and seed}} dispersal can have strong effects on early life history stages of plants. These processes {{have often been}} studied as individual effects, but {{the degree to which}} their relative importance co-varies with seed predator abundance and how this influences seed germination rates is poorly understood. Therefore, we used a combination of observations and field experiments to determine the degree to which germination <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> the palm Astrocaryum mexicanum varied with abundance of a small mammal seed predator/disperser, Heteromys desmarestianus, in a lowland tropical forest. Patterns of abundance of the two species were strongly related; density of H. desmarestianus was low in sites with low density of A. mexicanum and vice versa. <b>Rates</b> <b>of</b> predation and dispersal <b>of</b> A. mexicanum <b>seeds</b> depended on abundance of H. desmarestianus; sites with high densities of H. desmarestianus had the highest <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> predation and <b>lowest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> germination, but a greater total number <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> were dispersed and there was greater density of seedlings, saplings, and adults of A. mexicanum in these sites. When abundance of H. desmarestianus was experimentally reduced, <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> predation decreased, but so did dispersal <b>of</b> A. mexicanum <b>seeds.</b> Critically, <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> germination <b>of</b> dispersed <b>seeds</b> were 5  times greater than undispersed seeds. The results suggest that the relationship between A. mexicanum and H. desmarestianus is a conditional mutualism that results in a strong local effect on the abundance of each species. However, the magnitude and direction of these effects are determined by the relative strength of opposing, but related, mechanisms. A. mexicanum nuts provide H. desmarestianus with a critical food resource, and while seed predation on A. mexicanum nuts by H. desmarestianus is very intense, A. mexicanum ultimately benefits because of the relatively high germination <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> its <b>seeds</b> that are dispersed by H. desmarestianus...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIntrogression {{arising from}} crop-to-wild gene flow {{provides}} novel sources of genetic variation in plant species complexes. Hybridization within the Beta vulgaris species complex is of immediate concern: crop lineages (B. vulgaris ssp. vulgaris) hybridize easily with their wild relatives (B. vulgaris ssp. maritima) thereby threatening wild beet gene diversity with genetic swamping. Hybridization "hotspots" occur in European seed production areas because inland ruderal wild beets occur and reproduce in sympatry with cultivated beets. We studied gene flow occurring between seed-producing cultivars and ruderal wild B. vulgaris in southwestern France {{to determine whether}} feral beets, arising from unharvested cultivated seed, represent an opportunity for crop-to-wild gene flow. We surveyed 42 inland ruderal beet populations located near seed production fields for nucleo-cytoplasmic variation and used a cytoplasmic marker diagnostic of cultivated lines. Occurrence of cultivated-type cytoplasm within ruderal populations clearly reflected events <b>of</b> crop <b>seed</b> escape. However, we found no genetic signatures of nuclear cultivated gene introgression, which suggests past introgression of cultivated cytoplasm into a wild nuclear background through seed escape rather than recent direct pollen flow. Overall, patterns of genetic structure suggested that inland ruderal wild beet populations act as a metapopulation, with founding events involving a few sib groups, followed by <b>low</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> or pollen gene flow after populations are established. Altogether, our results indicate that a long-lived seed bank {{plays a key role}} in maintaining cultivated-type cytoplasm in the wild and highlight the need for careful management <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> production areas where wild and cultivated relatives co-occur...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{recovery}} of abandoned tropical pastures to secondary rainforest benefits from the arrival <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> from adjacent rainforest patches. Less is known, however, about how the structural attributes of adjacent rainforest (e. g. tree density, canopy cover and tree height) impact seed rain patterns into abandoned pastures. Between 2011 and 2013, we used seed traps and ground seed surveys to track the richness and abundance <b>of</b> rainforest <b>seeds</b> entering abandoned pastures in Australia 2 ̆ 7 s wet tropics. We also tested how seed rain diversity is related to the distance from forest, the proportion of forest cover in the landscape and several structural attributes of adjacent forest patches, specifically average tree height, canopy cover, tree species richness and density. Almost no seeds were captured in elevated pasture seed traps, even near forest remnants. Abundant forest seeds were found in ground surveys but only within 10 m of forest edges. In ground surveys, seeds from wind-dispersed species were more abundant, but less species rich, than animal-dispersed species. A survey of pasture seedling recruits suggested that some forest seeds must be dispersing more than 10 m into pasture at very low frequencies, but only a few species are establishing there. Recruits were predominantly animal-dispersed not wind-dispersed species. In addition to distance from forest and the proportion of forest within a 100 - to 200 -m radius of sampling sites, the richness and density of adjacent forest trees were the most important factors for explaining the probability <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> occurrence in abandoned pastures. Results suggest that without some restoration assistance, the recovery of abandoned pastures into secondary rainforest in Australia 2 ̆ 7 s tropical rainforests will likely be limited, at least in part, by a very <b>low</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> dispersal away from forest edges and by the diversity and density of trees in adjacent remnant forests...|$|R

Observation of the effect <b>of</b> <b>seeding</b> <b>rates</b> on the yield and yield components are useful in determining which of the components contributes most to the yield of a winter wheat variety and in developing optimum seeding rate recommendations. The experiments were conducted in 1963 - 1964, 1964 - 1965, and 1965 - 1966. The purpose of these studies {{was to determine the}} effect <b>of</b> various <b>seeding</b> <b>rates</b> on the yield and yield components of two winter wheat varieties and to find the optimum seeding rates for these varieties. A further objective was to determine if reasonable yields could be obtained from <b>low</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeding</b> for both varieties. The yield was measured in terms of bushels per acre. The yield components studied were (1) the number of spikes per unit area, (2) number of spikelets per spike, (3) number of kernels per spike, and (4) the weight of 100 kernels. The results were obtained and comparisons were made between the two varieties and their performance over a three-year period. There was considerable fluctuation in the yields involving both varieties for all seeding rates in the different seasons. The 1966 season was most favorable for Gaines and the 1964 season for Druchamp. Druchamp gave higher yields than Gaines for all <b>seeding</b> <b>rates.</b> The number <b>of</b> spikes per unit area for both varieties was most effected by differences in seeding rate in each year, while the other components showed no response. High yield of Druchamp was due to the result of more spikes per unit area, heavy kernels, and resistance to stripe rust. The yield of Gaines was the result of more kernels per spike. The higher seeding rates for both varieties produced the highest yields...|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to documented increases in woody plant dominance of former savannas and grasslands of North America, oak (Quercus L.) savannas that form lower treelines {{in the southwestern}} United States and northwestern Mexico have been relatively stable over the past millennium. This research identified potential biotic and abiotic constraints on seedling recruitment of Quercus emoryi Torr. (Emory oak) {{within the context of}} potential shifts in lower treeline. Field surveys were used to describe seedling distribution at and below lower treeline, and to determine the potential for acorn dispersal from lower treeline into adjacent grassland. Field and greenhouse experiments designed to determine constraints on seedling establishment included reciprocal soil transfers, nutrient amendment studies, provision of artificial shade, and manipulation of seasonal precipitation inputs. Results indicate that <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> Q. emoryi recruitment within grasslands below treeline are relatively low, and are constrained by <b>low</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> dispersal coupled with a low probability of seedling emergence. Seedling recruitment rates were directly correlated with quantity of summer precipitation, but were independent of winter precipitation. Results of this and complementary research suggest that lower treeline in southern Arizona is stabilized by self-enhancing feedback mechanisms <b>of</b> overstory shade, <b>seed</b> dispersal, and seedling establishment coupled with strong abiotic constraints beyond the current ecotone. The observed shift in treeline in the last millennium was less likely the result of slow, spatial progression of autogenic safe sites than the result of episodic and infrequent allogenic processes that simulated, or negated the importance of, conspecific, biogenic safe sites. Increases in summer precipitation are one such process that would facilitate (historic or potential future) downslope shifts in lower treeline. This interpretation is consistent with observations that downslope shifts in lower treeline which occurred 700 - 1700 ybp coincided with a period of particularly high summer precipitation in the region (i. e., the "Medieval Warm" period, 645 - 1295 ybp) ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Five newly {{released}} and two Eastern European winter wheat cultivars were grown under five different seeding rates (80, 160, 240, 320, 400 seeds per m²). Four of these {{newly released}} cultivars were grown at three different locations which have different environmental conditions. Data were obtained on grain yield, tiller number per plant, 1000 kernel weight, seed number per spike, plant and spike number per unit area, plant height, heading and maturity dates. At the <b>lowest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeding</b> the grain yield {{was significantly lower}} at all three locations. Although {{there were no significant}} differences for grain yield for all the other seeding rates, maximum yields were obtained from lower seeding rates at Ryan while at Hyslop and Madras, which had better moisture conditions, maximum yields were obtained at higher seeding rates. This situation was not observed for the Yamhill cultivar in which maximum yields were obtained at 160 seeds per m² seeding rate at all three locations. Tillers per plant value decreased as the seeding rate increased. Hyslop and McDermid produced significantly higher number of tillers per plant from the other cultivars. Significantly highest 1000 kernel weight values were obtained at the <b>lowest</b> seeding <b>rate.</b> Yamhill produced the highest significant 1000 kernel weight while Paha produced the lowest. Seeds per spike value followed the same order as tillers per plant and 1000 kernel weight showing a continuous decrease with the increased <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeding.</b> The number <b>of</b> plants per m² was a direct linear function <b>of</b> <b>seeding</b> <b>rate.</b> The number <b>of</b> spikes per m² increased curvilinearly with the increased seeding rate. Hyslop and McDermid produced the highest significant number of spikes per m² because of their higher tillering ability. Plant height increased with increased <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeding</b> because <b>of</b> the increased competition for light. Yamhill and Paha were significantly the tallest cultivars.

40|$|International audienceOver {{the past}} decade, Phelipanche ramosa, a weedy {{parasitic}} plant (broomrape), has been increasingly infesting winter oilseed rape (WOSR) fields in France. Elite WOSR lines have shown different responses in P. ramosa infested fields, suggesting that genetic variability {{might be available}} for breeding programmes targeting broomrape resistance. Ten WOSR genotypes selected for their contrasting response in field experiments were analysed using mini-rhizotron and greenhouse co-culture experiments to determine the components of resistance to broomrape. Partial resistance was revealed at three developmental stages of the parasitic plant. First, at the germination stage, parasite attachment {{to the roots of}} some WOSR lines was limited and associated with a <b>low</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> parasite <b>seed</b> germination. This mechanism of parasite avoidance could nevertheless be suppressed under high infestation in mini-rhizotron and greenhouse conditions. Second, at the root attachment stage, limited parasite attachment was observed in mini-rhizotron conditions under low and high infestation, and in greenhouse conditions. Third, after successful parasite attachment, some WOSR genotypes retarded and even disturbed the growth of tubercles, minimising and delaying parasite emergence from the soil. Although the exact mechanisms limiting parasite attachment and tubercle development require further investigation, our findings suggest that, by cumulating various resistance traits in new genotypes to enhance effectiveness and potential durability of resistance, breeding could be a promising control strategy in WOSR.

Seed harvested from some species was also tested for <b>seed</b> transmission <b>of</b> the virus. Seven of 18 genotypes belonging to 17 species of annual pasture and forage legumes evaluated in 2 replicated field experiments were ranked as highly susceptible to BYMV, 7 as susceptible, 2 as moderately resistant, 1 as resistant, and 1 as highly resistant. The most susceptible and sensitive were Biserrula pelecinus, Trifolium cherleri, T. incarnatum, and T. spumosum. Ornithopus sativus was resistant but sensitive, whereas Hedysarum coronarium was highly resistant. H. coronarium was not infected when manually inoculated repeatedly with 3 different BYMV isolates, Seventy-three of the 94 genotypes of 7 crop legume species tested in the same replicated field experiments were ranked as highly susceptible, including 58 / 68 of Lens culinaris. Of the remaining genotypes, 6 were susceptible, 5 moderately resistant, 9 resistant, and 1 highly resistant. Five other crop legumes were included in other field experiments in which these species were ranked as highly susceptible (1) or resistant (4). Overall, the most susceptible and sensitive crop legume species were Lens culinaris (most genotypes), Lathyrus cicera, L. ochrus, and Vicia narbonensis. Lathyrus sativus (3 genotypes only), V. sativa (4 genotypes), Cicer arietinum, Pisum sativum, and V. faba were resistant to isolate MI, and Lens culinaris ILL 7163 was highly resistant. When infected, C. arietinum was ranked as highly sensitive but symptoms within the other resistant crop species varied in sensitivity between genotypes. Extreme resistance was confirmed in Lens culinaris ILL 7163 when it was manually and aphid-inoculated repeatedly with 3 different BYMV isolates. When testing seedlings for <b>seed</b> transmission <b>of</b> BYMV, germination on moist paper towels before testing usually proved more effective than growing in soil in the glasshouse. <b>Low</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> transmission <b>of</b> BYMV (0. 03 - 1 %) were detected in 9 alternative pasture or forage and 3 alternative crop legume species.

Since 2000 B.C., it is {{being used as a}} traditional medicine by the tribes. The entire plant has been used in Siddha, Ayurveda and Unani medicine. G. superba is a tuberous plant with plow- (or) finger-shaped cylindrical tubers that are pure white when it is young [34]. It contains two major alkaloids namely Colchicines and Colchicosides. The <b>seeds</b> consist <b>of</b> colchicines, which are 2 – 5 times higher than in the tubers. Due to the medicinal value, this plant is collected from the wild and it belongs to rare plant species in India. It has been included in the Red data book.

40|$|When {{studying}} plant {{dynamics and}} succession, {{it is important}} to determine potential limiting factors affecting recruitment (Crawley 1990). The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate factors affecting the establishment and survival of woody species in weed infested areas around the central volcanic plateau. This was achieved by first describing these communities, and quantifying the number of native seedlings and saplings found in both forested and non-forested (weedy) areas. Seed input was measured with seed traps, and factors affecting recruitment of seedlings were investigated by manipulative field experiments. Although some native woody species were dispersed into weedy areas, both seed and seedling densities of most species declined rapidly with increasing distance from the forest margin. Sowing seeds at densities equivalent to 625 per m significantly increased seedling establishment of Griselinia littoralis and Coprosma 'taylorii' but not Pittosporum tenuifolium var. colensoi. Removal of exotic grasses (clearing treatment) that dominated in non-forest areas resulted in much greater establishment of all woody seedlings, including introduced broom (Cytisus scoparius) and several native species that had dispersed naturally. Most species also showed greater establishment in plots that were caged to prevent predation. However, the effects of clearing and caging treatments on survival of seedlings were not as apparent as they were for establishment. In addition, experimental clearing increased the growth of transplanted G. littoralis seedlings. Overall, most native species had much lower seedling establishment and survival in weedy areas compared with native forest. This is explained by a combination <b>of</b> both <b>seed</b> and microsite limitation in weedy areas. In another experiment designed to test the effects of bird consumption on seed germination, bird dispersers increased germination percentages of native species by removing fruits from seeds. All species examined (G. littoralis, Coprosma robusta, Pseudopanax crassifolius, and P. tenuifolium var. colensoi) showed very low germination <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> within fruit, and much greater germination <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> that were cleaned either by passage through birds or by hand. For C. robusta, G. littoralis, and P. tenuifolium var. colensoi, passage through birds also significantly increased germination <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> compared with those cleaned by hand. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> germination was less affected by different treatments than the absolute percentage germinating, but was generally faster in bird-voided compared to hand-cleaned seed. <b>Seeds</b> in both <b>of</b> these latter treatments germinated considerably faster than seeds within fruit. Invasion of native woody plants in weedy areas appears to be constrained by a combination <b>of</b> <b>low</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> dispersal for most species, and low probabilities of seedling establishment and survival in areas without disturbance. The most likely future scenario for the majority of weedy areas studied is continued dominance of exotic species in the short term, with slow succession to native shrubland as well-dispersed, frost-resistant native species such as manuka (Leptospermum scoparium) establish after disturbance. Management options are discussed with the aim <b>of</b> accelerating the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> succession in weedy areas to native forest...|$|R
30|$|Within {{these two}} large categories, {{analysis}} of raw mean data and DCA {{suggests that a}} group’s behavior varies between extremes of non-pyrophyte and pyrophyte types, but also according to seed bed depth influence and time of fire. Fire-sensitive groups range from major destruction <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> irrespective <b>of</b> depth (groups A and C) to some emergence capacity if seeds are located deeper (B). On the other extreme lies the F group with large emergence (and <b>low</b> destruction <b>rate)</b> <b>of</b> near-surface <b>seed</b> beds. In general, the more fire sensitive a subgroup is, the more it can benefit from deeper positioning, for a given fire-time. Conversely, if the limit of destruction is not exceeded, seeders seem to respond in inverse fashion. In short, among {{each of the two}} groups, varying degrees of fire sensitivity or susceptibility correlated to taxonomy can still be found between each group’s extremes. As with DCA, if one focuses on modalities of fire and ash treatment using formal predictive models, we could conclude that depth and fire time seem to act as relevant environmental controls interacting with functional species groups’ sensitivity to fire.|$|R
40|$|<b>Seeds</b> <b>of</b> native {{herbaceous}} vegetation adapted to germination in hydric soils (i. e., moist-soil plants) provide waterfowl with nutritional resources including essential amino acids, vitamins, and minerals that occur only {{in small amounts}} or are absent in other foods. These elements are essential for waterfowl to successfully complete aspects of the annual cycle such as molt and reproduction. Moist-soil vegetation also has the advantages of consistent production of foods across years with varying water availability, low management costs, high tolerance to diverse environmental conditions, and <b>low</b> deterioration <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> after flooding. The amount <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> produced differs among plant species and varies annually depending on environmental conditions and management practices. Further, many moist-soil impoundments contain diverse vegetation, and seed production by a particular plant species usually is not uniform across an entire unit. Consequently, estimating total seed production within an impoundment is extremely difficult. The chemical composition <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> also varies among plant species. For example, beggartick seeds contain high amounts of protein but only an intermediate amount of minerals. In contrast, barnyard grass is {{a good source of}} minerals but is low in protein. Because of these differences, it is necessary to know the amount <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> produced by each plant species if the nutritional resources provided in an impoundment are to be estimated. The following technique for estimating seed production takes into account the variation resulting from different environmental conditions and management practices as well as differences in the amount <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> produced by various plant species. The technique was developed to provide resource managers with the ability to make quick and reliable estimates <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> production. Although on-site information must be collected, the amount of field time required is small (i. e., about 1 min per sample); sampling normally is accomplished on an area within a few days. Estimates <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> production derived with this technique are used, in combination with other available information, to determine the potential number of waterfowl use-days available and to evaluate the effects of various management strategies on a particular site...|$|R

Crantz (Rosace~), in the British Isles {{initiated}} by the Botanical Society of the British Isles and the Biological Records Centre in 1914 are sUll 1 marised and analysed. It is confirmed that the tree is a useful indicator of ancient woodland an " hedgerows and that it shows a marked preference for two kinds of soil: those derived from clays and those derived " from harder limestones. The reasons for this are discussed as well as the occurrence of the species on other soils. It is suggested that the very <b>low</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> reproduction from <b>seed</b> is mainly the result <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> predation and that the northerly limits of its range are inftuenced by the lower <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> production in places with cooler, less sunnier summers. The pattern of modern records in England and Wales reflects to some extent the part the tree has played {{in the life of the}} countryside over many centuries. It has been conserved and planted in some areas for its fruit, its wood and for ornament, but in other areas it is scarcely known by local people and held in little regard. Today it is usually much commoner in the first of these areas. Areas where the Wild Service tree grows have been divided into three types: those where it is relatively abundant, those where it is scattered but widespread and those where it is rare. These often, but not always, show a correlation with the solid or drift geology. Mapping in this way also shows that there are large areas of England and Wales where conditions appear suitable but from which the tree has not been recorded...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} study to evaluate differentation of physical filtration system on responsse stress and survival <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> juvenile P. homarus. Experimental design of this study consisted of four treatments and two replications. The treatments were using flow through system without protein skimmer and filter (K), filtration system with protein skimmer (SK), filtration system with top filter (F) and filtration system with combinations of protein skimmer and top filter (SKF). P. homarus with initial weight 0. 18 + 0. 01 g were cultured for 60 days with density 250 lobster/tank. During maintenance, P. homarus were fed trash fish with feeding <b>rate</b> 20 % <b>of</b> body weight. Parameters of glucose hemolymph were evaluated to determine stress response. Stress response was determined at day 0, 6, 20 and 60. Parameters <b>of</b> survival <b>rate</b> were determined at the end of experiment. The result showed that the treatment of filtration system with combination of protein skimmer and top filter (SKF) decreased stress responsse by decreasing glucose hemolymph of juvenile P. homarus during maintenance. Survival rate also higher (P< 0. 05) in treatment SKF (33. 2 %) than other treatments. It is concluded that SKF was the best physical filtration system for juvenile period of spiny lobster P. homaru...|$|R
40|$|Great Salt Lake {{wetlands}} {{provide a}} number of invaluable ecosystem services, including water filtration and migratory bird habitat. Recent invasions of Phragmites australis have greatly reduced the cover of native wetland bulrush species, including alkali bulrush. Alkali bulrush is a critical wetland plant which provides valuable nesting habitat and nutritious seeds for migratory birds. Restoration efforts which aim to remove Phragmites and reseed wetlands with native species have proved unsuccessful due to <b>low</b> germination <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> bulrush <b>seed,</b> likely because the seeds are physiologically dormant. In order to break dormancy, seeds must be cold stratified in moist conditions, simulating wintertime. There is still much uncertainty {{in the scientific community}} concerning the length of cold stratification that is most effective at breaking seed dormancy, and whether the effect of cold stratification varies among source populations. Due to different evolutionary histories and site conditions, seeds sourced from different populations are biologically different and may vary in their germination response to cold stratification. This research project examines the effect of various lengths of cold stratification on the germination <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> alkali bulrush <b>seeds</b> collected in Fall of 2015 and 2016 from Sterling Wildlife Management Area, Farmington Bay Waterfowl Management Area, Ogden Bay Waterfowl Management Area, Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge, and Salt Creek Waterfowl Management Area. The project results may provide evidence for the most effective length of cold stratification and the genetic differences in alkali bulrush between various source populations. In my presentation I will address the significance of this research, the results thus far, and how this data can be used effectively for other research projects and to aid land managers in restoration efforts...|$|R
40|$|Comparing the Benefits Between Producing Maize for Seeds or Consumption in Cameroon. This paper {{compares the}} {{benefits}} between seed maize producers (using pure seed) and consumption maize producers (using residual seed) in the Western upper plateau zone of Cameroon. From the field survey, seed maize producers record higher crop yields and gross margins. The estimated Cobb-Douglas production functions show the highest significant coefficient for pure seed used by seed maize producers indicating that pure seed {{is the most}} productive input in both groups and thus using pure seed is more advantageous than residual seed. Results from the financial gain assessment by increasing other factor inputs indicate that mineral fertilizer, pesticides, sowing and weeding labour are more productive and beneficial to the seed maize producers. Hence, in spite <b>of</b> the high <b>seed</b> price and investment cost for this activity, farmers producing maize seed benefit more than those cultivating maize meant for food consumption. However, the <b>low</b> replacement <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> maize <b>seed</b> in the field (5 % per year) could explain the timidity of adoption of this activity by farmers. Cooperation is therefore recommended between different stakeholders (farmers, extension agents, research institutions, development partners, etc.) in order to sensitize farmers on the necessity to regularly renew their maize seed, which in turn would increase the country's maize production. These actors should convene on a good plan of action which would favor maize seed advertisement, rapid transmission of information to farmers, adhesion of farmers into cooperatives, subscription of farmers to journals/newspapers, financial and training assistance to farmers, creation of marketing board and micro-finance institutions to address the farmers' problems, etc...|$|R
40|$|Hart Prairie is a high-elevation upland {{riparian}} ecosystem on {{the west}} slope of the San Francisco Peaks in northern Arizona. The location is unique, not only as an upland riparian area in the semi-arid Southwest, but also for having a wet meadow ecosystem dominated by Bebb willow (Salix bebbiana). The ecosystem has experienced {{a high degree of}} change since the time of Euro-American settlement. Along with fire suppression, increased wild ungulate herbivory rates, and conifer encroachment into a historically short-grass prairie, several humaninduced changes have been made to the topography of the watershed. Stock tanks, an earthen berm with associated diversion channels, and a road that cuts perpendicularly across the direction of water flow near the base of the watershed have contributed to the altered drainage patterns and the decreased water availability to the flora and fauna in the area. As a result, the Bebb willows and the associated meadow vegetation are at risk. Most of the willows, which constitute the majority of the canopy in the ecosystem, are at a decadent, over-mature stage that allows a limited recruitment of younger plants (Maschinski 1991, Waring 1992). Under these conditions, the plant community may die off leading to the loss of this rare riparian area forever. Research on restoration efforts have been undertaken since the mid- 1990 s on The Nature Conservancy’s Hart Prairie Preserve and the adjacent US Forest Service Fern Mountain Botanical Area. This paper summarizes the efforts that have been made; most of which targeted to improve the <b>low</b> germination <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> willow <b>seeds,</b> and to restore the geomorphology and surface flow patterns to their pre-disturbance conditions...|$|R

40|$|Post-dispersal {{losses to}} seed predators: an {{experimental}} comparison of native and exotic old field plants C. S. Blaney and P. M. Kotanen Abstract: Invasions by exotic plants {{may be more}} likely if exotics have <b>low</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> attack by natural enemies, includ-ing post-dispersal seed predators (granivores). We investigated this idea with a field experiment conducted near Newmarket, Ontario, in which we experimentally excluded vertebrate and terrestrial insect seed predators from <b>seeds</b> <b>of</b> 43 native and exotic old-field plants. Protection from vertebrates significantly increased recovery of seeds; vertebrate exclusion produced higher recovery than controls for 30 of the experimental species, increasing overall seed recovery from 38. 2 to 45. 6 %. Losses to vertebrates varied among species, significantly increasing with seed mass. In contrast, insect exclusion did not significantly improve seed recovery. There was no evidence that aliens benefitted from a re-duced <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> post-dispersal <b>seed</b> predation. The impacts <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> predators did not differ significantly between natives and exotics, which instead showed very similar responses to predator exclusion treatments. These results indicate that while vertebrate granivores had important impacts, especially on large-seeded species, exotics did not generally benefit from reduced <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> predation. Instead, differences between natives and exotics were small compared wit...|$|R

This study tested the effects <b>of</b> time <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> harvest, kilning temperature at seed extraction and irrigation treatments applied to E. globulus trees on seed germination traits. Seeds were harvested from three genotypes at 11 months from commencement of flowering (early), 13 months (commercial) and 15 months (late) and kiln dried at 30, 40 or 50 C.

There was little delay in germination rate at 32 C in early-harvested seeds compared with that experienced by the commercial- and late-harvested seeds, suggesting that it has a higher temperature threshold.
