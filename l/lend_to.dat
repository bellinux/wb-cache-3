5|$|The global {{economic}} {{depression of the}} early 1930s affected Ireland less because of the partial recovery following {{the civil war and}} because industry was protected behind tariff barriers established in the Anglo-Irish Trade War (1932–1938).

5|$|The film used Technicolor's Oz process during post-production. This is {{a partial}} silver {{retention}} on the interpositive, similar to bleach bypass, {{which will be}} used to <b>lend</b> <b>to</b> the sense of detachment from the modern world McG was looking for. Industrial Light & Magic developed shader programs to make the desaturated lighting of the CGI realistic and well-integrated to the on-set footage. The filmmakers consulted with many scientists about the effects of an abandoned world and nuclear winter. McG cited , the original Star Wars trilogy and Children of Men, as well as the novel The Road, as his visual influences. He instructed his cast to read the latter as well as Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Like Children of Men, McG would storyboard scenes so that it would be edited together to resemble a seamless, continuous shot. It took two weeks to film a two-minute shot of Connor getting caught up in a bombing on the Skynet base where he discovers plans for the T-800.|$|E
5|$|Carrot soup can be {{prepared}} as a cream-style soup and as a broth-style soup. Vegetable stock or chicken stock {{can be used as}} ingredients in both styles of soup. Other vegetables may be used in the dish, including root vegetables, the latter of which may include garlic onion, shallot, potato, turnip and others. Carrot juice and orange juice can be used in its preparation, and some versions are prepared using puréed carrot. After cooking, the dish can be run through a sieve to strain it. The carrots used can be peeled or unpeeled, and the use of peeled carrots can <b>lend</b> <b>to</b> increased smoothness in puréed versions of the dish. Those prepared with puréed carrot may have a thick consistency while also being smooth in texture. The soup's color can vary based upon the coloration of the carrots used. Young carrots tend to make the soup sweeter and imbue it with a bright orange coloration, while older, larger carrots provide less sweetness and may imbue a yellow coloration. The use of old, cracked carrots that have a woody texture in their interior can produce a soup of inferior quality.|$|E

25|$|Banks {{with more}} {{reserves}} {{than they need}} {{will be willing to}} <b>lend</b> <b>to</b> banks with a reserve shortage on the interbank lending market. The surplus banks will want to earn a higher rate than the support rate that the central bank pays on reserves; whereas the deficit banks will want to pay a lower interest rate than the discount rate the central bank charges for borrowing. Thus they will <b>lend</b> <b>to</b> each other until each bank has reached their reserve requirement. In a balanced system, where there are just enough total reserves for all the banks to meet requirements, the short-term interbank lending rate will be in between the support rate and the discount rate.|$|E

25|$|In Venice, meanwhile, {{deliberations}} {{were taking}} place concerning the kind of assistance the Republic would <b>lend</b> <b>to</b> Constantinople.

Further undermining Byzantine morale, seven Italian ships with around 700 men slipped out of the capital at the moment when Giustiniani arrived, men who had sworn to defend the capital. At the same time, Constantine's attempts to appease the Sultan with gifts ended with the execution of the Emperor's ambassadors— even Byzantine diplomacy could not save the city.|$|E

40|$|How did the {{deregulation}} of U. S. bank activities affect {{the patterns of}} cross-border <b>lending</b> <b>to</b> emerging economies? Unlike bank lending from Europe or Japan, U. S. bank <b>lending</b> <b>to</b> emerging economies exhibited increasing volatility over time. Using U. S. cross-border bank exposure data, this study identifies a temporal association between important deregulation initiatives and the volatility of U. S. bank emerging market lending. This association is explained by the linkages between an important outcome of bank deregulation－earnings volatility from diversified bank activities－and the rising volatility. Together, it argues that U. S. banking deregulation had unanticipated effects of exacerbating the volatility of bank <b>lending</b> <b>to</b> emerging economies...|$|R
25|$|Murmurs sound {{characterized}} the quieter, introverted {{side of the}} first wave of alternative rock in the United States. The sound was new at the time, though not stepping beyond the constructs of traditional rock music. The guitars have a bright, ring-like chime that brought on comparisons to The Byrds, and the bass guitar has the bright punchy sound of the Rickenbacker favored by Mike Mills. Mills carries much of the melodic element of the music on the bass, contributing to the moody sound of early R.E.M. albums. Also contributing to this sound is the distant singing of Michael Stipe whose obscure lyrics, sung indistinctly, <b>lend</b> <b>to</b> the mystery and depth of the music.|$|E
25|$|The {{share of}} urban borrowers kept slowly {{increasing}} to about 30% of all loans {{but those were}} riskier loans. The share of loans to merchants, who were mostly Jewish, was particularly low – just 2.2% in 1889 when the average of other banks was 13.5%. A big jump in urban loans was seen in 1892 due to the agricultural crisis (from 8 million to 13.4 million). These loans helped industrialisation, but were blamed for a construction boom which later resulted in a bust. From 1901 to 1907, the bank auctioned 659 urban properties but managed to sell only 452 and suffered 2 million rubles in losses. There were no restrictions of Catholic nobles or Jews on acquiring urban properties. In 1902, to reign in the perceived abuses, the government limited urban loans to 30% of outstanding loans. Despite the losses and regulations, the bank continued to <b>lend</b> <b>to</b> city residents and the outstanding loans amounted to 35.9 million and represented 2,891 properties in 1915.|$|E

The man at the front is on or near to the point of death, and the man poised at the top of the group appears unable to prepare a defence for himself. His gaze is in the direction of the suffering children in front of him, but it does not fall on them.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the effect of}} strengthened capital requirements on the supply-side of bank <b>lending</b> <b>to</b> Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) in Europe. The thesis further assesses the effect of capital buffers on <b>lending</b> <b>to</b> SMEs in addition to examining how different bank lending practices are affected by stricter capital requirements. SMEs are of particular importance to policymakers since they heavily depend on bank financing and {{are an important part}} of the European economy. Using data from 10 different countries and 70 banks in Europe from 2008 to 2015, we estimate our model using a System Generalized Method of Moments. We find that a 1 percentage point increase in the Tier 1 ratio will result in a decrease of 1. 24 percentage point of <b>lending</b> <b>to</b> SMEs. Furthermore, we find that transaction-based banks are more adversely affected than relationship-based banks by increased capital requirements, and we find a negative relationship between the capital buffers and <b>lending</b> <b>to</b> SMEs.

500|$|Character {{designer}} Tetsuya Nomura {{has identified}} the South Pacific, Thailand and Japan as major {{influences on the}} cultural and geographic design of Spira, particularly concerning the geographic location of the southern Besaid and Kilika islands. He has also said that Spira deviates from the worlds of past Final Fantasy games {{in the level of}} detail incorporated, something he has expressed to have made a conscious effort to maintain during the design process. Kitase felt that if the setting went back to a medieval European fantasy, it would not seem to help the development team advance. While he was thinking of different world environments, Nojima suggested a fantasy world that incorporated Asian elements. Sub-character chief designer Fumi Nakashima's focus was to ensure that characters from different regions and cultures bore distinctive characteristics in their clothing styles, so that they could be quickly and easily identified as members of their respective sub-groups. For example, she has said that the masks and goggles of the Al Bhed give the group a [...] "strange and eccentric" [...] appearance, while the attire of the Ronso <b>lend</b> <b>to</b> them being able to easily engage in battle.

500|$|In {{his book}} Banker to the Poor: Micro-lending and the Battle Against World Poverty, Muhammad Yunus shows the outlook behind why Grameen Bank runs {{the way it}} does, saying, “ When you hold the world in your palm and inspect it only from a birds eye view, you tend to become arrogant, you do not realize things become blurred when viewed from an {{enormous}} distance. I opted instead for the” worms eye view.” … [...] The poor taught me an entirely new economics. I learned about the problems they face from their own perspective. “ Here we see his willingness to immerse himself with the people he is aiming to help. [...] We get our first look at Muhammad Yunus's perception of the absolute poor when he meets Sufiya Begum, a bamboo stool maker who was trapped in poverty's vicious cycle {{due to a lack}} of 27 cents. That is where we find that what will become Grameen bank, is founded upon one man's heart for those that society and big corporations could or would not help. [...] Taking productive action, Yunus worked with the banks and community around to empower people like Sufiya to be able to apply for credit, and use it in the best and most productive way that she knows how in her unique situation. [...] Grameen Bank would need to be a bank of unusual standards. It would have to be, as Yunus put it, [...] "an institution that would <b>lend</b> <b>to</b> those that had nothing.
