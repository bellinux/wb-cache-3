60|$|PRESS. [Laying down-his note-book] I say, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you as {{man to man}} for a moment.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I know it, and I wish unspeakably {{you would}} give it up--it isn't good--it's a great mistake. Stay here and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She mostly <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her," [...] confessed Mr Powell. [...] "I don't {{know that}} she was very much interested--but still she let me. She, never cut me short." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I {{appreciate}} your <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you, but it's cold and getting late, {{and you have}} sat on deck long enough. I'll see that somebody looks after the animals." ...|$|R
6000|$|Again {{she laid}} a hand on his, saying, [...] "I have longed <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> openly <b>to</b> you ever since we met in the cow-shed; but I could not make any advance to any of you, because," [...] she whispered in haste, [...] "I thought it my duty to hold back from Frank. And now, till we go away, Camilla watches me and {{occupies}} me every minute, will not even <b>let</b> <b>me</b> ride out with papa. I wonder she <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{alluded to}} them yourself. You {{know that they}} cannot be forgotten. What do you expect? <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> also <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you in figurative language. It happens {{sometimes}} that a tree is struck by lightning and killed in an instant--leaf, branch, and root--killed and turned to dust and ashes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Truly {{it is both}} {{food and}} rest that I want, at the proper times, but what I want with you now, is {{to take me to}} your own room, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come and {{sit down}} and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you," [...] he replied. Then he {{led her to the}} sofa, and as she seated herself I doubt whether she had not almost {{forgotten}} that her husband was dead.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{think it}} was the {{champagne}} at Gaunt House, don't you? It ain't that. Come in; <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you for a minute. I'll tell you what it is. D----it, let me tell somebody," [...] Foker said.|$|E
5000|$|... "Run It!" [...] {{takes place}} in a party setting, with Brown explaining, [...] "It's really a guy {{checking}} for a girl, or a girl checking for a guy...asking {{to see if they can}} run it. If they can be eligible to be your girlfriend, boyfriend, whatever. 'Let me see if you can run it; show me what you got.'" [...] "Yo (Excuse Me Miss)" [...] discusses the first conversation someone has with a girl: [...] "Fellas, first thing they say when they see a girl is 'Yo! Yo!'. I'm saying it like that, but technically not like that. She takes my breath away, all I can say is 'Yo, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> just <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you for a minute. Chill with me for a minute.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|NEWTE. Maybe you're not a judge. [Laughs.] They'll {{listen to}} reason. You <b>let</b> <b>ME</b> have a <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them, {{one of these}} days; see if I can't show them--first one and then the other--the {{advantage}} of leaving to [...] "better" [...] themselves--WITH THE HELP OF A LITTLE READY MONEY. Later on--choosing your proper time--you can break it to him that you have discovered they're distant connections of yours, a younger branch of the family that you'd forgotten. Give the show time to settle down into a run. Then {{you can begin to}} make changes.|$|R
60|$|She made me {{lie down}} on the couch, and, drawing a low ottoman near, sat close to my pillow, {{pressing}} my burning hands in her cold palms. She yielded to my feverish restlessness, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk,</b> and <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> on subjects strange indeed to beings, who thus looked the last, and heard the last, of what they loved alone in the world. We talked of times gone by; of the happy period of our early love; of Raymond, Perdita, and Evadne. We talked of what might arise on this desert earth, if, two or three being saved, it were slowly re-peopled.--We talked of what was beyond the tomb; and, man in his human shape being nearly extinct, we felt with certainty of faith, that other spirits, other minds, other perceptive beings, sightless to us, must people with thought and love this beauteous and imperishable universe.|$|R
6000|$|... "You've got a {{prisoner}} in there named Blake," [...] went on Pan. [...] "I once lived near him. He used to play horse with me and ride me on his back. Will you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! don't {{bother me}} with such trifles just now," [...] cried Ruby, {{thrusting}} his uncle {{into a chair}} and resuming his own seat at his mother's side; [...] "we'll speak of that at some other time; meanwhile <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But now I {{must stop}} chatting about myself, for I {{know that you}} cannot be {{interested}} in a simple old fogey such as I am. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you about your letter and about the difficult question it raises for all marriageable young men.|$|E
5000|$|She {{wrote and}} {{directed}} the 1971 biker Bury Me an Angel. She {{was one of two}} female directors working for New World Pictures in the 1970s, the other being Stephanie Rothman. Film writer Gary Morris argued that [...] "her New World work is arguably more subversive than Rothman's." [...] She worked in a variety of capacities for that company, also production managing and second unit directing. Peeters:We lived like gypsies, sleeping in the hallways when we couldn’t pay rent, sharing a car among five people. I thought I had the best life in the world. I was making movies. What were the other girls I’d graduated high school doing back in Iowa? They were marrying the boy who had the biggest farm.Peeters was quoted in 1978 as saying:I don't like to be dictated to once I start shooting. If you tell me I have to shoot eight pages in a day and its 6pm, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> alone. Don't <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> at midnight until I am done. If I'm going to take the blame, then I want to make the decisions. If I fail, I won't die. I consider real power the point when you're not afraid to fail... I don't know any director who wants to spend his whole life making low budget exploitation movies, just as nobody wants to spend their whole life in kindergarten. You look forward to graduating to high school.Peeters formed Big Movie Company with Terry Schwartz, intending to develop projects for female stars. However Peeters fell ill in 1979 and spent some time out of the industry.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have wanted}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you so much. The first time I saw you.... At first I dared not.... I {{did not know}} you would <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk....</b> And now, just as I am--happy, you are going." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I'm {{trying to}} tell you about that, if you'd only shut up a second and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk.</b> You don't give a fellow a chance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Uncle Lester, it isn't any trick. I am Phil, your nephew. I {{want to talk}} to you. I've got {{the best}} kind of news for you; {{something}} that you'll be glad to hear. Won't you please open the door and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wish I {{knew some}} really smart woman, and nice, that would see what I'm {{trying to get}} at, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her and--I wonder if Myra's right? Could the fellows think I've gone nutty just because I'm broad-minded and liberal? Way Verg looked at me--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's not so asy, Mr. Keegan, {{for an old}} man to hear for {{the first}} time, that he's to lave his house and his home for iver; {{where he and his}} father and his {{grandfather}} have lived. You'd better <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him a while." ...|$|E
6000|$|ANNA--I'm {{coming to}} him. But you--you did mean it that way, too. You sounded--yust {{like all the}} rest. [Hysterically.] But, damn it, shut up! <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> for a change! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly. Whatever his {{feelings}} are, he must {{act as a}} gentleman and an officer. Just you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> it over with him. He has great respect for all I say; I've noticed that already." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{how did you}} manage?" [...] Bertram inquired {{with some}} diffidence. [...] "It raises a point you wouldn't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> about at Peshawur, but I've often felt guilty because I didn't insist. Traveling about as you have done is expensive." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Honor dear,' he said pleadingly, {{yet with}} authority, 'pray <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you. There are things which I wish {{very much to}} say; indeed, without which I could hardly have asked for this indulgence. It is for your own sake, {{and that of the}} place and people.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, Lizzy,' said Stockdale, {{when the}} crackle of the wheels had nearly died away. 'This is a fit finish to your adventure. I am truly thankful {{that you have}} got off without suspicion, and the loss only of the liquor. Will {{you sit down and}} <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, ma'am," [...] said Jane, with an {{astonishing}} change of note, [...] "think {{of all that}} might have been! Oh, ma'am, I could have been so happy! I ought to have known, but I didn't know...You're very kind to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you, ma'am...for it's hard on me, ma'am...it's har-r-r-r-d--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "First <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> {{a little}} with Hetty," [...] {{returned}} the party appealed to; [...] "Was the raft made a'ter you had got your breakfast, gal, and did you walk from the camp to the shore opposite to us, here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But it is so, Bell; {{and why not}} say it? Do {{you think}} I never say it to myself in the hours when I am all alone, {{thinking}} over it--thinking, thinking, thinking. You must not,--you must not grudge <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> of it sometimes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} been able to persuade Mrs. Butler," [...] said Lady Staunton to the Captain, during the {{interval}} when Jeanie had left the parlour, [...] "to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> of making any recompense for storming her house, and garrisoning it in the way I have done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] he cried, [...] "my dear! why do {{you always}} want to turn love into--touches?... Stand up again. Stand up there, my dear; don't think I've ceased to love you, but stand up there and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you as one man to another. If we let this {{occasion}} slide to embraces...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Dear Miss Floy!' cried Susan, {{bursting}} out afresh, {{and shaking}} her head violently, 'it's nothing new to you to help yourself and others too and be the patientest and truest of noble hearts, but <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Mr Walter Gay and settle it with him, for suffer you to go away across the world alone I cannot, and I won't.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know just}} how the girl feels. I went through it myself. It's hard, but it won't hurt her, only don't try to talk it over with her. If she's the girl I think she is, she'll work the whole matter out in a week herself. More than that, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her myself. If she's rested, ask her to come down." ...|$|E
6000|$|MISS REED: [...] "I will free my {{mind with}} {{neatness}} and despatch. I simply wish {{to go over}} the whole affair, from Alfred to Omaha; and you've got <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> as much slang and nonsense as I want. And then I'll skip all the details I can. Will you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk!</b> My mind's made {{up about}} one thing: I'm {{not going to}} be a lawyer. I don't want to go back to Harvard. I'm going to keep a hotel, and, if I don't keep one here at Lion's Head, I'm going to keep it somewhere else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Huh! What's the use {{of being}} chief story-teller when you won't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> tell a story?" [...] grumbled Shadow. [...] "But I know what I'll do," [...] he added, with a sudden twinkle in his eye. [...] "If you won't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk,</b> I'll write it down. And I'll write a {{sentence}} none of you can read and be sure of," [...] he went on.|$|R
