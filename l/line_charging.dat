25|$|Bernadotte {{determined}} to attack at 10:00 AM. Holding back his cavalry and the 96th Line, he sent Dupont's 32nd <b>Line</b> <b>charging</b> for the bridges, with one battalion of the 9th Light and three guns in support.

The Prussians foot soldiers {{on either side of}} the road were cut off from the bridge and became prisoners. Those dragoons who did not pull back in time were forced to swim across the river. In less than an hour, Dupont's troops captured all three bridges and General von Hinrichs. They burst into the town, overwhelmed a Prussian battalion in the marketplace, and chased a second battalion out the Steinthor. Rapidly, Halle was occupied along with both the Galgenthor and Steinthor. Here the French paused to wait for the rest of Bernadotte's corps to appear.|$|E

50|$|In {{electrical}} engineering, the Ferranti {{effect is}} an increase in voltage occurring at the receiving end of a long transmission line, above the voltage at the sending end. This occurs when the line is energized, but there is a very light load or the load is disconnected. The capacitive <b>line</b> <b>charging</b> current produces a voltage drop across the line inductance that is in-phase with the sending-end voltage, assuming negligible line resistance. Therefore both line inductance and capacitance are responsible for this phenomenon.|$|E

An efficient {{method to}} obtain {{this type of}} beams is to extract a long pulse, high current beam from a gun at high energy, and let the beam pass through a decelerating field to compress it. The low energy beam-bunch is loaded into a solenoid and matched to a Brillouin flow. The Brillouin equilibrium is independent of the energy if {{the relationship between the}} beam size (a), solenoid magnetic field strength (B) and <b>line</b> <b>charge</b> density is such that (Ba) {sup 2 } is proportional to the <b>line</b> <b>charge</b> density.
