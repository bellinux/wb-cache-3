The first book concludes with a very interesting chapter on copyhold tenures, which marks the exact point at which the tenant—by-copy-of-court-roll, the successor of the villein, who, in his turn, represented the freeman reduced to villeinage by the growth of the manorial system, acquired security of tenure.|$|R

40|$|We {{estimate}} how households trade off immediate costs and uncertain future benefits {{that occur in}} the very long run, 100 or more years away. We exploit a unique feature of housing markets in the U. K. and Singapore, where residential property ownership takes the form of either leaseholds or freeholds. Leaseholds are temporary, pre-paid, and tradable ownership contracts with maturities between 99 and 999 years, while freeholds are perpetual ownership contracts. The price difference between leaseholds and freeholds reflects the present value of perpetual rental income starting at leasehold expiry, and is thus informative about very long-run discount rates. We estimate the price discounts for varying leasehold maturities compared to freeholds and extremely long-run leaseholds via hedonic regressions using proprietary datasets of the universe of transactions in each country. Households discount very long-run cash flows at low rates, assigning high present value to cash flows hundreds of years in the future. For example, 100 -year leaseholds are valued at more <b>than</b> 10 % <b>less</b> <b>than</b> otherwise identical <b>freeholds,</b> implying discount rates below 2. 6 % for 100 -year claims...|$|R

Overall suzerainty in a fief remained with the feudal lord, who could require of his vassals certain services which varied from vassal to vassal. Also, the ownership of a fief was split so that a lord had dominium directum and his tenant in fee had dominium utile (German nutzbares Eigentum). By contrast, an allodiary had a full <b>freehold</b> <b>interest</b> — or dominium plenum (volles Eigentum) — in his allod.
