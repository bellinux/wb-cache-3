If the <b>launch</b> <b>of</b> <b>EMU</b> expedited financial integration, this affected pricing of assets and optimal portfolio allocation. We focus on the Euro area sovereign bond market, the money market and the stock markets and review whether the pricing of assets converged to a mechanism of EMU-pricing. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of EMU on portfolio adjustments. Finally, we look at the evolution of the cost of capital and the risk sharing capacity of the EMU market. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} interplay between money market {{development}} and changes in monetary policy operating procedures in 11 European countries from c. 1980 up to the <b>launch</b> <b>of</b> <b>EMU.</b> Aspects of money market development such as the size and structure of different market segments, and institutional and regulatory changes, are addressed. We recount and empirically examine the extent of reorientation of monetary policy instruments away from quantitative direct control instruments toward indirect market-based instruments. The process of financial deregulation is uniform across the countries. The path of money market development varies substantially, whereas changes in central bank instruments show both similarities and differences. We hypothesise {{a relationship between the}} two processes and provide tentative evidence. Monetary policy operations; Money market; European Union; Deregulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{deepening}} {{of economic}} and financial integration in the European Union has led to different responses from the group of ‘cohesion’ countries. Ireland and Portugal stand out as the two extreme examples, as Ireland caught-up to the forerunners very rapidly after the <b>launching</b> <b>of</b> <b>EMU,</b> in 1992, whereas Portugal lost ground. This paper looks at structural shifts in order to explain the different performances of the two economies. We conclude that Portugal’s labour productivity lag was {{the outcome of a}} less favourable structure of employment; that differences in the structure of employment are not clustered in specific industries; and that such structural differences are associated with different factor endowments, namely physical and human capital.

40|$|The European Investment Bank (EIB) {{differs from}} most other {{international}} financial institutions (IFIs) in that it lends {{in all of its}} member countries, not only in its poorer members. It does lend throughout the world, but most of its lending is within the European Union (EU). A significant share is within some of the world's wealthiest countries. There is nothing new to this situation, and the EIB has survived as the oldest of the regional IFIs. What has changed is the speed of economic integration in Europe. The Single Market, eliminating barriers to intra-EU trade in financial services, has been put in place, and {{the end of this year}} will see the <b>launch</b> <b>of</b> <b>EMU.</b> The question of the appropriate role for the EIB in the next century would seem to be even more challenging than that of other IFIs, operating exclusively in countries where substantial poverty continues to exist (1).

40|$|We {{make use}} of micro-level data for over 45, 000 private bonds issued by over 5000 firms from 22 {{countries}} in 1990 - 2006 to analyze the impact that the <b>launch</b> <b>of</b> the <b>EMU</b> had on the currency denomination of the bond issues. To our knowledge, ours is the first systematic analysis of issue at the micro level. The use of the micro data allows us {{to distinguish between the}} response to the advent of the euro by new and seasoned bond issuers, and to condition on other issue characteristics. We find that the impact on new issuers is larger than on seasoned issuers and that most of the increase in the euro-denominated bond issuance was along the "extensive" margin. Insofar as new entrants to the bond market will define the overall currency composition in the long run, these results imply that aggregate studies might be underestimating the euro effect. We also find that to a large extent the increase in euro issuance was "at the expense" of U. S. dollar issuance, suggesting that the euro competes with the U.

40|$|A {{milestone}} in European integration was achieved when {{the third and}} final stage <b>of</b> <b>EMU</b> began on January 1, 1999, with the introduction of the euro. 1 This annex provides a progress report on several aspects of EMU: European financial market integration; implementation and performance <b>of</b> the <b>EMU</b> payments and securities settlement systems; the outlook for pan-European capital markets; banking system consolidation and restructuring; and broader financial policy issues, including financial supervision, regulation, and crisis management. The <b>launch</b> <b>of</b> the euro went smoothly, reflecting careful preparations for the considerable operational and logistical challenges of the conversion weekend.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{aimed to}} survey current {{practices}} in European epilepsy monitoring units (EMUs) {{with emphasis on}} safety issues. METHODS: A 37 -item questionnaire investigating characteristics and organization <b>of</b> <b>EMUs,</b> including measures for prevention and management of seizure-related serious adverse events (SAEs), was distributed to all identified European EMUs plus one located in Israel (N= 150). RESULTS: Forty-eight (32 %) EMUs, located in 18 countries, completed the questionnaire. Epilepsy monitoring unit beds are 1 - 2 in 43 %, 3 - 4 in 34 %, and 5 - 6 in 19 % of EMUs; staff physicians are 1 - 2 in 32 %, 3 - 4 in 34 %, and 5 - 6 in 19 % <b>of</b> <b>EMUs.</b> Personnel operating in EMUs include epileptologists (in 69 % <b>of</b> <b>EMUs),</b> clinical neurophysiologists trained in epilepsy (in 46 % <b>of</b> <b>EMUs),</b> child neurologists (in 35 % <b>of</b> <b>EMUs),</b> neurology and clinical neurophysiology residents (in 46 % and in 8 % <b>of</b> <b>EMUs,</b> respectively), and neurologists not trained in epilepsy (in 27 % <b>of</b> <b>EMUs).</b> In 20 % <b>of</b> <b>EMUs,</b> patients' observation is only intermittent or during the daytime and primarily carried out by neurophysiology technicians and/or nurses (in 71 % <b>of</b> <b>EMUs)</b> or by patients' relatives (in 40 % <b>of</b> <b>EMUs).</b> Automatic detection systems for seizures are used in 15 %, for body movements in 8 %, for oxygen desaturation in 33 %, and for ECG abnormalities in 17 % <b>of</b> <b>EMUs.</b> Protocols for management of acute seizures are lacking in 27 %, of status epilepticus in 21 %, and of postictal psychoses in 87 % <b>of</b> <b>EMUs.</b> Injury prevention consists of bed protections in 96 % <b>of</b> <b>EMUs,</b> whereas antisuffocation pillows are employed in 21 %, and environmental protections in monitoring rooms and in bathrooms are implemented in 38 % and in 25 % <b>of</b> <b>EMUs,</b> respectively. The most common SAEs were status epilepticus reported by 79 %, injuries by 73 %, and postictal psychoses by 67 % <b>of</b> <b>EMUs.</b> CONCLUSIONS: All EMUs have faced different types of SAEs. Wide variation in practice patterns and lack of protocols and of precautions to ensure patients' safety might promote the occurrence and severity of SAEs.

40|$|From introduction). By many standards, {{economic}} and monetary union (EMU) {{is a major}} success. The transition to the new currency was remarkably smooth. The euro area has enjoyed remarkable price stability. After several years of disappointing economic performance between 2001 and 2005, growth picked up in 2006. Economic integration among the countries participating in the single currency has progressed. In spite of fashionable talk about a break-up of the euro area, {{the reality is that}} there are many countries wishing to join and none seeking to leave. Nearly twenty years after the Delors Report provided the blueprint for EMU, fifteen years after the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty and almost ten years after the <b>launch</b> <b>of</b> the euro, <b>EMU</b> is still unfinished business. There is disagreement on which reforms are most desirable, the degree to which national economic policies should be coordinated, {{and the nature of the}} dialogue between ministers of finance and the monetary authority. A common thread throughout this report is the need for the policy framework of the euro area to be made clearer, more transparent and more accountable.

Do these "flaws " represent major threats to the future <b>of</b> <b>EMU?</b> Or will they be successfully resolved by the European policy authorities, leading to a lasting and prosperous EMU?

40|$|This study {{addresses}} and evaluates {{the impacts of}} {{the introduction of the}} euro on both actual and potential output and employment. In order to achieve this, a descriptive and analytical examination of developments before and after the <b>launch</b> <b>of</b> the euro is undertaken, with comparisons drawn between countries that are EMU members and non-EMU members. There are several channels through which the euro may have affected growth and employment: greater transparency and its impact on competitiveness and the effectiveness of the single market; integration of financial markets, which may raise productivity; and a more stable macroeconomic environment, which affects risk and investment decisions. We analyse the impact of each of these channels on the drivers of growth, after controlling for factors such as workforce skills, research base, openness, demographic developments and structural reform on the evolution of output. The central result of our study is that EMU affects output growth directly and also promotes reductions in output and real effective exchange rate volatility and thereby influences the accumulation of productive capital. Many potential concerns preceding the <b>launch</b> <b>of</b> the euro seem to have been unfounded, and our work suggests that the effects <b>of</b> <b>EMU</b> that we observe have been beneficial for economic growth and employment overall. Our analysis suggests that the direct positive effects <b>of</b> <b>EMU</b> are likely to be larger in the core countries, despite their recent slow growth, and that EMU may lead to agglomeration <b>of</b> activities. <b>EMU,</b> euro, euro and growth, euro and employment...|$|R

40|$|This volume {{deals with}} US {{policy and the}} end of the Bretton Woods fixed {{exchange}} rates regime between 1969 and 1973. It is based on the records of the three secretaries that served in the US Treasury under the Nixon administration (Kennedy, Connally and Shultz) on the files of their undersecretary for Monetary Affairs (Volcker), and on White House, NSC, Federal Reserve and State Department records. From the very beginning of its term in office, the Nixon administration included the need for a different international monetary system in the broad process of reshaping of US foreign policy that would take the forms of the Nixon Doctrine, Détente, and the opening to China. US economic and political exigencies called for a "flexible" system based on the dollar, intended to serve the trends toward growing transnational investments by US companies and banks, as well as the perceived need of a diminished financial constraint on overseas military commitments. However implicitly, and with a trial and error process concerning implementation, this entailed a de facto new conception of US hegemony globally, as well as a serious clash of interests with the West European allies in particular. As West European plans, to create their own shield against monetary instability, took on growing credibility throughout 1970 with the <b>launching</b> <b>of</b> the <b>EMU</b> and the Werner plan, US policymakers moved towards the unilateral suspension of their commitment to Bretton Woods. This came on 15 August 1971, after months of deep internal debate within the administration, involving both economic and geopolitical reflections. The second half of 1971, as well as the year 1972, marked the beginning of a different phase. The US administration proceeded quite ruthlessly in the dismantling of the Bretton Woods system, sometimes actually using global financial instability to secure its objectives. A new conception of global American power was taking shape, and, for what concerns the Transatlantic relationship, a clearer definition of western hierarchies de facto replaced the idealistic visions of the "partnership" of the 1960 s...|$|R

30|$|In Table 4, {{we report}} the effects the {{measures}} conducted in Spain {{have on the}} rest <b>of</b> <b>EMU.</b> There {{are at least three}} findings worth pointing out. First, whenever the measure raises private-sector output in Spain, it does so for the rest <b>of</b> <b>EMU,</b> too. At first sight, this may be surprising because one might guess that an increase in Spain’s international competitiveness resulting from these labor market reforms may harm other member countries. However, the resulting additional demand for foreign goods in Spain overcompensates for the loss in competitiveness faced by the rest <b>of</b> <b>EMU</b> countries vis-á-vis Spain, at least on an aggregate level. 14 Second, all measures beneficial for Spain improve the labor market situation in the rest <b>of</b> <b>EMU.</b> The reason is that the additional demand for foreign goods in Spain is produced by more labor input there, too. Given the improvement in the labor market, yielding (slightly) higher wages, too, we note that, third, liquidity-constrained RoT-consumers do not lose from the reforms in Spain—in contrast to the situation in the reforming country itself.|$|R
