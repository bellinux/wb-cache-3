As both parties risk their counter-party walking away if the price goes against them, the contract may involve both parties lodging a margin {{of the value of the}} contract with a mutually trusted third party.

500|$|Specter {{received}} several high-profile endorsements {{during the final}} {{weeks leading up to}} the primary. Senator John Kerry, who had been an early supporter of Sestak's 2006 House campaign, endorsed Specter in the Senate race, calling him [...] "fighter and a friend, and I am proud to vouch for his character". The Philadelphia Inquirer called Sestak [...] "a worthy opponent" [...] and said that his determination made the race especially competitive, but ultimately embraced Specter, whose overall career record the newspaper said was [...] "a good choice for Democrats". The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette also endorsed Specter, focusing more on the fact that Specter stood the best chance of defeating Toomey in a general election challenge. The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, however, endorsed Sestak, calling him [...] "incredibly intelligent, thoughtful and articular" [...] while condemning Specter as a [...] "self-serving political ferret" [...] for switching parties. Actor Michael J. Fox, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, appeared in a television advertisement for Specter, praising the Senator for his long-standing support of stem cell research. Fox said, [...] "In the fight against disease, you can look back or move forward. Arlen Specter is moving forward." [...] President Obama sent e-mail messages to his Organizing for America supporters encouraging them to vote for Specter, However, despite his <b>long</b> <b>position</b> of support for Specter, Obama did not fly to Pennsylvania to actively campaign for the Senator during the campaign's final days.|$|E

2500|$|One {{variant of}} selling short {{involves}} a <b>long</b> <b>position.</b> [...] "Selling short against the box" [...] consists of holding a <b>long</b> <b>position</b> {{on which the}} shares have already risen, whereupon one then enters a short sell order for {{an equal number of}} shares. The term box alludes to the days when a safe deposit box was used to store (long) shares. [...] The purpose of this technique is to lock in paper profits on the <b>long</b> <b>position</b> without having to sell that position (and possibly incur taxes if said position has appreciated). Once the short position has been entered, it serves to balance the <b>long</b> <b>position</b> taken earlier. Thus, from that point in time, the profit is locked in (less brokerage fees and short financing costs), regardless of further fluctuations in the underlying share price. For example, one can ensure a profit in this way, while delaying sale until the subsequent tax year.|$|E

The traditional underlying argument is that low correlations of international stock returns make the variance of an international portfolio lower than the variance of a purely domestic portfolio when <b>long</b> <b>positions</b> are taken on the domestic and foreign markets. Our analysis of more than 100 portfolios involving developed and emerging markets shows that correlations are not adequately low to produce effective diversification when <b>long</b> <b>positions</b> are taken.

[...] Shorting a futures contract is sometimes also used by those holding the underlying asset (i.e. those with a <b>long</b> <b>position)</b> as a temporary hedge against price declines. [...] Shorting futures may also be used for speculative trades, in which case the investor is looking to profit from any decline in the price of the futures contract prior to expiration.|$|E

The share of return variance explained by backwardation rises from 24 % at a one-year horizon to 64 % using five-year time periods. A historical examination of soybean production and trading suggests that the profitability of a passive <b>long</b> soybean <b>position</b> during the early part of their sample may have resulted from inadequate inventories and storage facilities at the time. These conditions created the conditions for demand-driven price spikes. Further, the thin margins of soybean processors likely increased hedging demand.

40|$|There {{is a lot}} of {{interest}} in forecasting oil price and in analysing which variables most affect price movements, especially whether non-fundamental variables such as financial activity have any systematic impact on oil price. In this paper we approach both questions by constructing a congruent econometric model with financial and fundamental variables and by analysing the relative weight of the variables in explaining the oil price forecast. After testing for different variables we find that the most accurate forecast from a monthly econometric vector model on oil price is obtained when non-commercial <b>long</b> <b>positions,</b> petroleum stocks and spare capacity are included as explanatory variables. The incorporation of non-commercial <b>long</b> <b>positions</b> clearly improves the accuracy of the prediction. The vector model is specified to include empirical cointegration relationship, which provides an approximation on the long-run restriction postulated by economic theory. Copyright 2010 The Authors.
