40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Alimentar - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determinate}} the factor (s) which modify the macroscopic appearance of packaged cooked ham during illuminated retail display, in order to minimize the number of product losses. The results show that the main factor in the change of the visual appearance of cooked ham was the iluminance. The increase of iluminance caused faster discolouration of the product, however, above 60 and 120 lux for thinner and thicker ham respectively, ham´s macroscopic appearance changed after 1 day. The lamp which allowed the better preservation of ham´s colour (from 1 to 3 days) was the one which presented the lowest iluminance. The others caused the colour change generally after 1 day of exposure. The statistics confirmed that no differences were found (α> 0, 05) in the analyzed parameters (log Total Viable Count, Total Volatile Basic), when the ham was exposed to the light or different conditions of illuminated retail display. In the future, it´s suggested the pigmentation of the <b>lid</b> <b>film</b> of cooked ham (retailer brand), in order to prolong the shelf life of these products...|$|E
40|$|The reagent {{delivery}} mechanism in a point-of-care, HIV diagnostic, microfluidic device is studied. Reagents held in an aluminum pack are released {{on the opening}} of a fluidic seal. Fluidic seals, controlling the flow of reagents, are characterized to reduce anomalies in the desired flow pattern. The nature of the current seal was investigated. Four seal patterns - line hemisphere, line flat, chevron hemisphere and chevron flat were created and tested for reagent delivery using a flow sensor and a force gauge. Preliminary experiments suggested that one of the patterns - "line-flat" - resulted in fewer flow anomalies. A parameter scoping exercise involving sealing process parameters (temperature, time, gap and distance) was performed for the line flat seal. The findings of this research can be divided into three categories - 1) bonding phenomenon in current seals, 2) influence of seal pattern on flow and rupture mechanics and 3) process parameters which result in the least flow anomalies. The current seal is found to be a bond between the exposed aluminum on the <b>lid</b> <b>film</b> and the heat seal coating on the dome film. The two chevron patterns result in large amounts of flow anomalies, the line hemisphere pattern also resulted in some instances of flow anomalies. The line-flat pattern creates a seal with the least flow anomalies. A specific set of temperature, time, gap and distance which minimizes flow anomalies was found. The flow performance of the reservoir improved and delamination decreased as the distance of the seal from the reservoir was reduced. The thesis also develops a model to better understand the deformation of the reagent carrying dome and flow dynamics prior to and following the opening of the seal. The dome deformation model provides a framework for relating volume, delamination and flow rate to the geometry and material properties of the reservoir pack. by Tejas Satish Inamdar. Thesis (M.

40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) forming of {{paperboard}} and heat sealing of <b>lidding</b> <b>films</b> to trays manufactured {{by the press}} forming process are investigated in this thesis. The aim of the work was to investigate and recognize the factors affecting the quality of heat sealing and the leak resistance (tightness) of press-formed, polymer-coated paperboard trays heatsealed with a multi-layer polymer based <b>lidding</b> <b>film.</b> One target was to achieve a solution {{that can be used}} in food packaging using modified atmosphere packaging (MAP). The main challenge in acquiring adequate tightness properties for the use of MAP is creases in the sealing area of the paperboard trays which can act as capillary tubes and prevent leak-proof sealing. Several experiments were made to investigate the effect of different factors and process parameters in the forming and sealing processes. Also different methods of analysis, such as microscopic analysis and 3 D-profilometry were used to investigate the structure of the creases in the sealing area, and to analyse the surface characteristics of the tray flange of the formed trays to define quality that can be sealed with satisfactory tightness for the use of MAP. The main factors and parameters that had an effect on the result of leak-proof sealing and must be adjusted accordingly were the tray geometry and dimensions, blank holding force in press forming, surface roughness of the sealing area, the geometry and depth of the creases, and the sealing pressure. The results show that the quality of press-formed, polymer-coated paperboard trays and multi-layer polymer <b>lidding</b> <b>films</b> can be satisfactory for the use of modified atmosphere packaging in food solutions. Suitable tools, materials, and process parameters have to be selected and used during the tray manufacturing process and lid sealing process, however. Utilizing these solutions and results makes it possible for a package that is made mostly from renewable and recyclable sources to be a considerable alternative for packages made completely from oil based polymers, and to achieve a greater market share for fibre-based solutions in food packaging using MAP...|$|R

40|$|Most {{polymeric}} {{materials used in}} fresh-produce packaging have lower water-vapour transmission rates relative to the transpiration rate of fresh produce. The consequences are high humidity levels and condensation of water vapour inside the package. Humidity-regulating trays were developed and tested in this study. They were made from a thermoformed multilayer structure consisting of polyethylene (outside), a foamed hygroscopic ionomer (active layer) with 0 or 12 % (w/w) NaCl, and a hygroscopic ionomer (sealing layer, inside). These trays were used to study moisture absorption kinetics at 100 % relative humidity (RH) for 16 days. Additional trays containing 7 g water were sealed with the high barrier <b>lidding</b> <b>film,</b> and headspace RH was monitored continuously over time. Finally, strawberries and tomatoes were {{used to test the}} performance of the humidity-regulating trays. The amount of moisture absorbed by the tray was directly proportional to the amount of salt embedded into the tray matrix, e. g. 0 and 12 % (w/w) salt trays absorbed 7. 6 and 13. 2 g moisture, respectively. The headspace RH in the trays sealed with <b>lidding</b> <b>film</b> was found to be 89. 8, 99. 6 and 100 % in trays with 12 and 0 % (w/w) salt and control polypropylene trays, respectively. The trays containing fresh produce were able to regulate RH below 97 %, but at the expense of higher product weight loss (2 - 3 % for strawberry, 1 % for tomatoes) compared with control polypropylene trays (0. 6 %) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{modified}} atmosphere (MA) {{conditions on the}} quality of minimally processed pineapple slices were determined. Commercial pineapple slice packs sealed with 40 pm thick polyester film were kept at 4. 5 degrees C for 14 d. The oxygen transmission rate of the film was 23 ml m(- 2) day(- 1) atm(- 1) (at 25 degrees C, 75 % RH). In-built atmospheres {{and the quality of the}} products were determined. O- 2 concentrations within the packs stabilised at 2 %, while CO 2 concentrations increased to 70 % by day 14. The high CO 2 level suggested an inappropriate <b>lidding</b> <b>film</b> permeability for the product, and hence affected its quality. Three batches of pineapple slices were packed in the laboratory using <b>lidding</b> <b>films</b> with oxygen transmission rate of 75, 2790 or 5000 ml m(- 2) day(- 1) atm(- 1) (at 23 degrees C, 0 % RH). Headspace atmospheres from laboratory-packed pineapple slices suggested an optimum equilibrium modified atmosphere of ca. 2 % O- 2 and 15 % CO 2. Respiration data from the laboratory-prepared packs were pooled together and used to develop a correlation model relating respiration rates to O- 2 and CO 2 concentrations. The model showed a decrease in respiration rate with decreasing O- 2 and increasing CO 2 concentrations. Respiration rate stabilised at 2 % 02 and 10 % CO 2. The high concentrations of CO 2 observed in the commercial packs did not fit the range in the respiration model. The model could aid in selection of MA conditions for minimally processed pineapple fruit...|$|R

40|$|For {{packaged}} fresh produce, inappropriate high {{relative humidity}} (RH) levels and condensation of water vapour cause premature spoilage. Humidity-regulating trays {{were developed to}} solve this issue. They were made from a thermoformed multilayer structure: polyethylene (outside) /foamed hygroscopic ionomer (active layer) with 0 or 12 wt% NaCl/hygroscopic ionomer (sealing layer, inside). Moisture absorption kinetics of the humidity-regulating trays with 0 and 12 wt% NaCl (T- 0 and T- 12, respectively) was investigated under different RH conditions (76, 86, 96 and 100 %) at 13 °C for 16 days. Additional trays containing 7 g of distilled water were closed with a high barrier <b>lidding</b> <b>film,</b> and the headspace RH was continuously monitored {{as a function of}} time. As control, a polypropylene (control-PP) tray was used. Strawberries and tomatoes were used to test capability of the trays to regulate in-package RH. The amount of water absorbed by the T- 0 and T- 12 trays was 7. 6 and 13. 2 g, respectively. Active hygroscopic ionomer layer was effective in water vapour absorption, and the integration of NaCl into this active layer increased the water vapour absorption capacity of the tray. The Weibull model adequately described the moisture sorption kinetics of the individual packaging trays as a function of time. The headspace RH of trays covered with a <b>lidding</b> <b>film</b> was found to be 89. 8, 99. 6 and 100 % in the T- 12, T- 0 and control-PP trays, respectively. The T- 12 trays containing fresh produce best regulated the in-package RH below 97 % and maintained overall quality, but at the expense of slightly higher product weight loss (2 – 3 wt% for strawberry, 1 wt% for tomatoes) compared to the control-PP trays (0. 3 – 0. 6 wt%) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a laser-based, non-contact sealing technique for thin, polyester-based <b>lidding</b> <b>films,</b> used in PET containers for food packaging. The method uses a beam-steered laser {{to seal the}} container, thereby enabling virtually instant change over from one product line to another. Unlike conventional sealing PET film processes, no bespoke tooling is required to hold the package components in close proximity and under pressure whilst the seal is formed. This greatly reduces sealing machine tooling costs and potential downtime at product changeovers. Results are presented that show that the process is able to produce seals of higher strength using thin (26 µm) polyester film than those from the conventional thermal/mechanical process. This provides a potential for increased production flexibility, reduction in product wastage, and for reducing the cost and embodied energy in construction of a less massive sealing machine...|$|R
40|$|The extrusion-coated {{paperboard}} tray packaging {{which contains}} a tray container {{and a piece}} of <b>lidding</b> <b>film</b> is widely used along with MAP technology in fresh food packaging industry. Much research has been done on perforation onto <b>lidding</b> <b>film.</b> This research is based on the attempt of perforating on the tray materials : uncoated paperboard and paperboard coated with PE polymer or PET polymer. The study was an approach to the perforations on the paperboard and how to design its patterns. The study focused on to which degree does the perforation influences the strength of the paperboard materials. The diameter and the shape of perforations were observed. The GTR and WVTR of the materials were tested. From the comparison of 25 patterns, it is inferred that the better tensile strength could be achieved when the micro-holes placed with more distance and more uniformly. The less perforation done on horizontal direction of the sample, the better tensile properties it gains. The less destructing rows made on the samples, the better tensile strength the sample gets. More even and straight fraction surfaces appeared in MD samples, while CD samples also have slant and more layered fraction surfaces. Tensile strength in MD is close to two times higher than CD samples. These results are caused by the orientation of the fibers. The appearance differences between micro-holes of the three materials are quite obvious. For manual made perforated hole, the surface is not smooth enough. For laser made perforation, the paperboard got discoloration due to laser, perforation on uncoated board is more flat, outstanding ring circles appeared on PET and PE boards, and a few bubbles could be seen around the ring circle of PET coated board. The perforation could increase the WVTR of three kinds of boards effectively. The design of patterns and the observation of perforations could give the theoretical reference for manufactures or engineers who wants to apply the laser perforation on composite paperboard...|$|R
40|$|Ethylene {{vinyl alcohol}} (EVOH) {{is one of}} the best known {{flexible}} thermoplastic oxygen barrier materials in use today. It is especially important for refrigerated and shelf-stable foods where oxygen deteriorates the quality of packaged products and reduces their shelf life. EVOH accounts for a majority of thermoplastic barrier materials used for rigid or semi-rigid retortable food containers. However. it is of limited use in flexible packages or <b>lid</b> <b>films</b> for rigid trays used for packaging thermally processed shelf-stable low acid foods due to its moisture sensitivity. Nevertheless, current use of other oxygen barrier materials such as polyvinylidene chloride and aluminum foil creates environmental concerns. Innovations in food processing technologies provide opportunities for increased use of EVOH in food packaging. The aim of this review is to give an overview of research on the oxygen barrier properties of EVOH from the perspective of structure-barrier property relationships and the consequences of food processing conditions...|$|R
40|$|Predicting {{microbial}} {{safety of}} fresh products in modified atmosphere packaging implies {{to take into}} account the dynamic of O 2, CO 2 and N 2 exchanges in the system and its effect on microbial growth. In this paper a mechanistic model coupling gas transfer and predictive microbiology was validated using dedicated challenge-tests performed on poultry meat, fresh salmon and processed cheese, inoculated with either Listeria monocytogenes or Pseudomonas fluorescens and packed in commercially used packaging materials (tray + <b>lid</b> <b>films).</b> The model succeeded in predicting the relative variation of O 2, CO 2 and N 2 partial pressure in headspace and the growth of the studied microorganisms without any parameter identification. This work highlighted that the respiration of the targeted microorganism itself and/or that of the naturally present microflora could not be neglected in most of the cases, and could, in the particular case of aerobic microbes contribute to limit the growth by removing all residual O 2 in the package. This work also confirmed the low sensitivity of L. monocytogenes toward CO 2 while that of P. fluorescens permitted to efficiently prevent its growth by choosing the right combination of packaging gas permeability value and initial % of CO 2 initially flushed in the pack...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To develop current {{treatment}} {{recommendations for}} dry eye disease from consensus of expert advice. METHODS: Of 25 preselected international specialists on dry eye, 17 {{agreed to participate}} in a modified, 2 -round Delphi panel approach. Based on available literature and standards of care, a survey was presented to each panelist. A two-thirds majority was used for consensus building from responses obtained. Treatment algorithms were created. Treatment recommendations for different types and severity levels of dry eye disease were the main outcome. RESULTS: A new term for dry eye disease was proposed: dysfunctional tear syndrome (DTS). Treatment recommendations were based primarily on patient symptoms and signs. Available diagnostic tests were considered of secondary importance in guiding therapy. Development of algorithms was based on {{the presence or absence of}} lid margin disease and disturbances of tear distribution and clearance. Disease severity was considered the most important factor for treatment decision-making and was categorized into 4 levels. Severity was assessed on the basis of tear substitute requirements, symptoms of ocular discomfort, and visual disturbance. Clinical signs present in <b>lids,</b> tear <b>film,</b> conjunctiva, and cornea were also used for categorization of severity. Consensus was reached on treatment algorithms for DTS with and without concurrent lid disease.
