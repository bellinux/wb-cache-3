40|$|We {{propose a}} {{flexible}} and robust scheme to create closed quasi-one dimensional guides for ultra-cold atoms through the dressing of hyperfine sub-levels {{of the atomic}} ground state. The dressing field is spatially modulated by inductive effects over a micro-engineered conducting loop, freeing the trapping region from <b>leading</b> <b>wires</b> in its proximity. We show that arrays of connected ring traps can also be created by carefully designing {{the shape of the}} conducting loop. We report on characteristics of the trap and mechanisms that limit the range of parameters available for experimental implementation, including non-adiabatic losses and heat dissipation by induced currents. We outline conditions to select appropriate parameters for operation of the trap with atom-chip technology. Comment: 7 pages, 7 pdf figure...|$|E

40|$|The {{addition}} of wire {{is an option}} during laser welding, laser cladding or laser additive manufacturing. By high speedimaging of <b>leading</b> <b>wire</b> addition during fibre laser keyhole welding {{it was observed that}} for the 40 experiments underconsideration the wire tip always established a concave boiling front. The front appears similar to a keyhole front and issort of a continuation of the keyhole, owing to the <b>leading</b> <b>wire</b> employment. For most of the parameters the melt istransferred downwards from the wire tip into the melt pool surrounding the keyhole front. In other words, hardly anyuncontrolled spatter to the sides was observed. A trailing wire would normally tend to a completely different behaviour. Typical as well as limiting phenomena of the wire melt transfer mechanism are presented and discussed. Controlledvertical melt transfer of the wire through the ablation pressure from a laser-induced boiling front, either in contact withthe workpiece surface or positioned higher above, can be a desirable mechanism of metal deposition for the differenttechniques, namely welding, surface treatment or LAM. By suitable choice of the laser power density above the boilingthreshold, the here observed mechanism can be applied in a controllable manner. An interesting technique option islateral beam oscillation for example by a galvanometer optics which shears off the melt {{in a manner similar to}} remotefusion cutting. The process limits become different to the static technique. The wire melt transfer technique has thepotential to be developed further towards a highly controllable remote drop transfer, e. g. in terms of direction.

40|$|In tandem {{gas metal arc}} (GMA) welding, it is {{important}} to prevent adverse effects caused by electromagnetic interference between the two adjacent arcs to create good metal transfer. In the tandem pulsed GMA welding system, newly developed by the authors, pulse peak currents are fed simultaneously to the leading and trailing electrodes in principle and a unique pulse timing control is employed in which the end of a pulse peak current for the trailing wire is delayed by 0. 5 ms from that for the <b>leading</b> <b>wire</b> to prevent the arc extinguishing By using the tandem pulsed GMA welding system, the effects of the inter-wire distance, inclination angle and welding current (wire feed rate) ratio between the two wires have been investigated to study the essential requirements for the welding torch configuration and the allocation of welding currents to obtain sound weld beads with the absence of undercut and humping in the high speed welding of steel sheets. When the welding speed was 3 m/min, a sound weld bead with uniform width was obtained with the trailing wire set at 9 -degree push angle regardless of the inclination angle of the <b>leading</b> <b>wire.</b> The inter-wire distance greatly affected the weld bead formation in high speed welding. That is, the maximum welding speed was improved with the proper inter-wire distance in the range 9 to 12 mm. In the proper range of welding current ratio, IT/IL= 0. 31 to 0. 5, the maximum welding speed achieved was 4 to 4. 5 m/min, which is 275 % higher at the maximum when compared with single wire pulsed GMA welding (at a maximum welding speed of 1. 2 m/min) ...|$|R
