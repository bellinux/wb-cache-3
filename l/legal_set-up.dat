40|$|This {{contribution}} {{addresses the}} emergence {{and challenges of}} European space governance, of which the framework and ambitions have been {{laid out in the}} recently adopted European Space Policy (ESP). The authors explore the legal and institutional challenges linked to the further evolution of European space governance. In doing so, they first provide an overview of the challenges arising out of the conceptual interactions between European governance and space governance. Next, the authors discuss the past and present <b>legal</b> <b>set-up</b> of Europe in space. Finally, they consider the effect of the ESP on future governance, including the possible implications of the Lisbon Treaty. The contribution concludes that the future of space governance in Europe requires a novel legal solution which will have substantial repercussions on how decision-makers perceive the Union and its strategic role. status: publishe...|$|E

China differs {{from most of the}} countries studied in the law, institutions, finance, and growth literature: Its legal and financial systems as well as institutions are all underdeveloped, but its economy has been growing at a very fast rate. Despite its English common-law origin and British-style judicial system and democratic government, there is enough documented evidence to suggest that the effective level of investor protection and the quality of legal institutions in India are quite weak as well. However, this has evidently not prohibited growth in either country. Small and high growth firms in both countries make extensive use of informal and relationship-based arrangements to finance growth...|$|R

They vary in their <b>legal</b> and administrative <b>set-up</b> but have in common {{that they are not}} 'regions' in an administrative-constitutional sense. Many cross-border regions are based on some sort of civil-law agreements among the participating authorities. For instance, the classical form of a Euroregion is the ‘twin association’: On each side of the border, municipalities and districts form an association according to a legal form suitable within their own national legal systems. In a second step, the associations then join each other {{on the basis of a}} civil-law cross-border agreement to establish the cross-border entity. Many Euroregions along the Germany-Benelux border are established according to this model, following the initiatives by the EUREGIO.|$|R
40|$|Italian {{administrative}} {{law has been}} undergoing an evolution aimed at progressively eliminating the relevance that merely formal defects have traditionally held, an evolution which has nonetheless struggled to gain prominence {{in the case of}} the procedures for obtaining public commissions. In this regard, the aim of safeguarding the fundamental right to equality of treatment has been pursued by means of merely formal rules, whose strict compliance has always been regarded as indispensable for the accomplishment of the afore mentioned aim. The necessity of going beyond the former <b>legal</b> <b>set-up</b> in order to fully guarantee the principle of “favor partecipationis” has gained prominence with some difficulty and solely recently. This doctoral thesis, by analyzing the field of exclusions from public tenders, aims to illustrate how the evolution of national tender law has been taking place at the material level, and to show to what extent the phenomenon of the so-called hybridization of the Italian legal system under the influence of European law has actually affected this very evolution itself...|$|E
40|$|Comparative law’ {{was born}} to {{challenge}} national self-centredness {{at the turn of}} the 19 th to 20 th centuries, without transcending—notwithstanding its admission of social and cultural-historical approaches in the study of law—the perspectives of rule-positivism. ‘Comparative legal cultures’ attempts at explaining the prevailing cultural and traditional diversity that has generated, among others, western law with its modern formalism and the alternative ways of reaching social order in other cultures. By its focus upon the underlying culture and, thereby, also upon the hermeneutic understanding of legal phenomena, the latter is expected to offer growingly adequate responses to timely questions such as the universalisability of law and human rights, the convergence of the continental Civil Law and the British Common Law, or the development and future of the <b>legal</b> <b>set-up</b> in the Central and Eastern European region. The interest of the comparative study of legal cultures is thus one in the history of ideas, dedicated to human problem-solving as the cultural response of people to external challenges. For the description of living complexes in terms of mere rules can result at most in ‘thin description’ with the exclusion of ‘thick description’, the more so as rules (just as concepts) are only the consequences of a kind of possible representation, therefore, relying exclusively upon them may contribute to dissolving even prevailing interrelations, atomising organic components as fragmented into detached elements. Or, institutional thinking not-withstanding, not even the subject’s formalism can serve as a ground for restricting human completeness and integrity, cultural diversity, as well as responsibility to be taken for these. ...|$|E
40|$|Student design {{agencies}} have not previously received much – if any – academic attention, despite their having become fairly {{common in the}} context of tertiary design / visual arts institutions since the late 1990 s as a way of providing work–study experiences. This article, for the first time, outlines case studies of four international student design agencies in Germany, Malaysia and the USA, including their background, their <b>legal</b> <b>set-up,</b> their relations with their parent institutions, and their (business) activities and general operations, as well as their members’ motivations for participation. All case studies are based on interviews by email or Skype with respective agency heads conducted from November 2012 to January 2013. The information obtained from the interviews was further rounded by additional materials – where available – and turned into short comprehensive narratives that highlight the particular qualities of the respective cases. The concluding comparison of these four narratives establishes that student design agencies are worthwhile knowledge transfer endeavours with strong indications of educational value, though more formal research would need to be done to confirm quantitative and qualitative effects. The four cases also allow for the deduction that the most important criterion for the success of a student design agency is its ability to create an intensive working experience with a strong focus on team interaction, and that the achievement of such experience is essentially based on on-campus space, staff involvement, competitive admission and non-business-related activities.

40|$|On its {{independence}} in 1947, India {{was among the}} two most industrialized nations in Asia. Since then it adopted a “mixed economy” approach that hindered its national growth and the optimum utilization of its immense resources (both natural and human). To re-establish itself as an economic force in the region, India liberalized its economy in early 1990 s. The adoption of the “free market economy” model has created great opportunities for foreign businesses. This article provides useful information on the complex business environment, aimed to help foreign businessmen and investors to develop a good understanding on key background knowledge for being successful in India.

40|$|Based on a {{case study}} of the {{so-called}} ‘Kafferskraal’ land claim, this article scrutinizes the ongoing land restitution process in post-apartheid South Africa with regard to its capacity to provide a transition towards ‘justice’. After sketching the <b>legal</b> and institutional <b>set-up</b> of land restitution, the justice of the actual restitution process is explored with reference to conflicting interpretations by various actors involved in this exemplary case. Here, a focus on divergent understandings of what historically constituted valid rights in land as well as forms of past compensation reveals continuing discrepancies regarding the legitimacy of various property regimes. These differences, leading to divergent evaluations of ‘the justice’ of this claim’s final outcome, are shown to be ultimately rooted in incompatible logics of exceptionality and the ordinary, which conceive of land restitution in terms of either ‘law making’ or ‘law preserving’. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of such a configuration of land restitution as a measure of transitional justice...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the development}} of environmental governance in Kosovo, environmental laws, regulations, processes, and their conformity with the EU environmental acquis. Kosovo, like {{other countries in the}} Balkans trying to join the EU, will, in the process of accession, have to ensure that its legislation conforms to the Copenhagen accession criteria. While Kosovo authorities have progressed in the process of legal harmonization, there has been little progress in executing the legal framework in terms of institutional design, necessary processes and policy developments. The key question posed in this paper is whether the environmental governance approach in Kosovo, in line with EU accession process, represents an appropriate framework for dealing with the country‟s environmental problems. The current Kosovo <b>legal</b> framework, institutional <b>set-up,</b> and current practice will be evaluated against conformity with the EU acquis. The implementation of EU environmental acquis in Kosovo is to be seen as an important opportunity to create environmental governance and stable processes of assessing environmental impact and increasing environmental policy integration...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{decision}} of the European Court of Justice in the Centros case, it has become popular in company law to draw comparisons between the United States economic constitution and the Single European Market. Since then, fears of a European “Delaware Effect,” which would create a “race to the bottom,” have hounded the debate on European company law. In this discussion, however, the unique constitutional framework of both the EU and the U. S. is seldom regarded. This constitutional framework, nevertheless, determines the behavior of both the legislators at state level and the market participants. This Article compares the impact of two major principles of both constitutions on company law: the U. S. dormant Interstate Commerce Clause and the Freedom of Establishment and the Freedom of Capital in the EU Treaties. The Article finds that the U. S. constitutional framework is more lenient on states and thereby grants them broader discretion to regulate company law. Further, it will argue that this is rooted in the specific <b>legal</b> <b>set-up</b> of the two common markets. The European Single Market, unlike the U. S., grants explicit free movement rights to capital and direct investments, establishing a modern framework. Further, European legal doctrine is faced with the paradox that the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) equates natural persons and companies, whereas in reality, companies differ from natural persons in many respects. The U. S. constitutional framework instead relies on the concept that companies are creatures of state law in order to grant states larger powers...|$|E
40|$|In {{the era of}} globalisation, uneven {{development}} among regions facilitates and {{fuels the}} flow of capital to cheap-labour developing countries. Simultaneously, labour from the global South is swarming into the well-paid global North. The influx of immigrant labour plays a unique role in the informal sectors and {{is the cause of}} the boom of the ethnic economy in the receiving countries. At the same time, the debate on exploitation of these immigrants in developed countries like Finland is ongoing. This essay uses in-depth interviews and participatory observation to examine the reasons shaping the gap between the local labour legislation and actual practice. It further seeks to investigate the factors that facilitate the exploitation of immigrant workers as well as potential obstacles to defending their rights, using the example of Chinese immigrant labour. After three months of intensive interactions with Chinese victims of labour exploitation and project workers from the Chinese Victim Support project, this thesis concludes that Chinese immigrant labour’s weak bargaining power in the local labour market is conditioned by the institutional <b>legal</b> <b>set-up,</b> the exclusiveness of the dual labour market and immigrant labour’s dependency on the ethnic economy as well as ineffective Trade Union support. This essay will further outline potential areas of improvement for external institutions, e. g. authorities, Trade Unions and NGOs to monitor the implementation of Collective Agreements and to incorporate immigrant workers into the available labour protection system. These factors lead to a low-wage competition among ethnic Chinese economy and further facilitate the vicious circle of co-ethnic exploitation. The improvement of the situation requires more efficient cooperation and regulation between all the institutional forces, enhanced regulations as well as awareness raising among the victims themselves...|$|E
40|$|Some Localised Agro-Food Systems (LAFS) are {{traditionally}} qualified as success stories (Comté PDO in France, Gruyere PDO in Switzerland, Parmigiano Reggiano PDO in Italy), whilst other PDOs (as {{for example the}} Cantal PDO from France) pay the same price for the milk as standard milk. The price difference may reach between 10 and 25 % over a long period. To explain this difference, {{we assume that the}} agents who make up the LAFS developed a collective action to protect their localized cheese production system against unfair competition and to promote their product outside its region of origin. The aim of this communication is to shed light on levers which the agents activate to assure their uniqueness is irrevocable, and uphold the benefits of their LAFS. We propose to discuss the idea that the search for market power based on the strategy of raising rivals’ costs may be used even outside a situation of vertical integration or a situation in which pressure is applied to suppliers to challenge competitors. We assume that some companies within the LAFS have sufficient control on the rules governing the organization of the traditional system to benefit from it. They also succeed in protecting a kind of relationship between business companies. The Raising Rivals’ Costs theory helps to analyze the economic consequences of the <b>legal</b> <b>set-up</b> implementation and of its control by some companies. Indeed, we show that the collective control of the rules which are set up in the PDO legal framework explain the difficulties met by rivals to stand out through an alternative and independent production system based on the costs leadership strategy. The collective set up of institutions and rules help the agents to achieve a collective competitive advantage in which every agent benefits individually. This is the strategy developed in Europe and particularly for two PDO Localised Agro-cheese Systems: Comté PDO for France and Gruyère PDO for Switzerland.

40|$|What is {{happening}} to civil society? Until recently, we have equated itwith the nation-state. Or rather, the nation-state has defined civil society. We speak of Danish civil society, French civil society and so on. This makes good sense. Civil society is indeed anchored in an institutional and <b>legal</b> complex <b>set-up</b> and maintained by the state (Cohen and Arato, 1992). As a consequence, civil societies exist under {{a wide variety of}} conditions depending on regime type. Military dictatorships suppress civil society, while democracies promote it. In some cases, civil society is even seen as a force of change. In the 1980 s and 1990 s, there was much excitement among sociolo-gists about its role in bringing about changes towards democracy in Latin America and Eastern Europe. Again, this power was attributed to national civil societies. What took place in Polish civil society, and what did Brazil-ian civil society do? But something happened in the early 1990 s when the concept of globaliz-ation made its way into the social sciences to a fanfare. Civil society was easily appended to this discussion {{and all of a sudden}} everyone was speaking about global civil society. Globalization was apparently pulling up the national tent pegs of civil society, pushing it into a global sphere where indi-viduals and social movements interact across physical, social, political and cultural distances. Despite the slightly sarcastic tone I am using here, there is no doubt that something like this is occurring. And the concept of global civil society may even be convenient shorthand for describing it. But how well does the concept work analytically and theoretically? What can it do for sociological research on globalization and social movements? Does it really advance our understanding of the phenomena I just mentioned or does i...|$|R
40|$|In recent decades, {{hazardous}} waste generation {{has increased in}} industrialized countries, and disposal facilities, especially landfill spaces, have become scarce and therefore more expensive. As a result, exports of {{hazardous waste}} to developing countries, especially to Africa grew considerably due to low cost of "disposal". African countries lack the <b>legal</b> and industrial <b>set-ups</b> and technical capacity {{to dispose of the}} waste safely. In an attempt to control such exports, African countries adopted the Bamako Convention in January, 1991. The Convention was modelled on the Basel Convention, an instrument adopted earlier on the same subject, but at a global level. Except with respect to certain issues like clean production methods, non-polluting technology and inter-African trade in hazardous waste, the Bamako and Basel Conventions are identical and contain similar shortcomings. On account of Africa's reality, however, the Bamako Convention should have approached the problem of transboundary movements of hazardous waste {{within the context of a}} comprehensive legal, economic, political, ethical and environmental strategy. Reliance on people's participation, regional environmental assessment and co-operation with industrialized countries should have been emphasised. Furthermore, African countries should have sought solutions at global, regional and national levels...|$|R
40|$|The traders are {{assigned}} ex lege {{a number of}} acknowledged professional obligations, like the obligation of registering in the Trade Register. Besides these traditional obligations, new and complex obligations have been regulated for traders, obligations that are specific to the tradersconsumers relation. These regulations are subordinated to the Consumer Law domain, which in Romania represents a contemporary creation, {{a result of the}} process of transposing the communautaire acquis. Consumer protection is regulated by general and specific rules, the latter ones referring to the following sub domains: advertising; informing about the prices of the products offered to the consumers for sale; unfair clauses from the contracts concluded between the traders and the consumers; the contracts negotiated away from business premises; concluding and executing distant contracts related to financial services; consumer credit; packages of tourism services; protection of the contracts related to the right to use some immovable goods for a limited period- timeshare; selling of the products and warranties associated; general safety of the products; responsibility of the producers for the damages generated by the defective products; unfair commercial practices and ways to cease the unlawful practices in respect of the protection of consumers’ collective interests. New obligations for the traders are established through the content of both general and specific regulations, obligations that are effected in imperatives and especially in interdictions. The legal regime of the obligations that resulted this way transcend the regime of the traders’ traditional obligations, making up the new paradigm of the traders’ activity and it represents the theme of this paper. Our research focused on determining the obligations set-up for the traders through both categories of rules and through their legal regime. As a result of the research carried on this theme, we conclude that setting-up this new category of obligations for the traders represents an actual means of achieving the aim of ensuring the consumer protection, adding-up to other <b>legal</b> means <b>set-up</b> in this regard. traders; professional obligations; Consumer Law; unfair practices; misleading and aggressive practices; consumer credit; advertising. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} mainly to explore Bahir Dar University (BDU) academic staffs’ involvement in their college academic decision-making processes. It discovered their share in the governance system of the University. Inline with this, the study attempted to identify the <b>legal</b> <b>set-up</b> that promotes shared governance in the university, to pinpoint the specific areas in which academic staffs are allowed {{to participate in the}} decision-making processes of the university, to find out the roles and influence of academic staffs in the university governance process and to uncover the major challenges that condition the participation of the academic staffs. To this effect, qualitative research method particularly case study method was employed. As a source of information, top, middle and lower-level actors, and teachers were included. Seven individuals have been participated in the discussion and interview sessions. Besides, document analysis was conducted for Ethiopian HE proclamation, strategic plan of BDU, Ethiopian education policy 1994, and BDU legislation. In order to validate the interview/discussion items, different capable persons including the research supervisor examined it and pertest was conducted; as a result, the necessary measures were taken. Data collected through the above strategies were presented descriptively followed by discussions and implications. HE proclamation, education policy, university legislation and strategic plan of the university describe that academic staff have the right to exercise their professional authority and academic freedom in shared decision-making procedures. All of the documents promote the implementation of shared governance by increasing the participation of academic staffs in both academic and administrative issues in the university as well as in their units. But, the practicality of most of these legal rights have been restricted by the university top and middle-level leaders’ direct and indirect interferences. The study showed that academic issue decision-making power tilts towards the university top management. The academic staffs’ role is limited to teaching the course contents which got approval from the course chairs and the middle-level leaders. They are not influential even if the issue at hand is about the teaching learning process. The influential decision makers are outsiders than insiders. College and departments have no a trend of setting their own agenda. Rather, the university prepare agenda based on the direction forwarded from federal government or MoE. Practically, the main areas where academic staffs make decision in the university are academic Staffs hiring, academic promotion and professional development with some interference from the top-level actors. In general, the governance system of the university seems top down rather than shared one. The university top leaders’ control over the teaching-learning endeavours made academic staffs to feel disrespected. This kind of governance system and other reasons (leaders’ behaviour, lack of transparent leadership, interference, lack of sense of ownership, less concern for quality education, inadequate interpersonal communication) are hindrances to the shared governance practices of the university. Finally, the university and its units need to reconsider the nature of HE in order to promote participation of their academic staffs and to resolve conditions that push academic staffs away from sharing roles in the governance processes...|$|E
