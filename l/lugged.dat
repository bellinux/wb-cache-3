5|$|As at Darwin, Herring's primary {{difficulty}} was logistics. The {{troops on}} the Kokoda Track had to be supplied from Port Moresby either by air or by Papuan native carriers who <b>lugged</b> stores over the track on their backs. MacArthur created the Combined Operation Service Command (COSC), an unusual combined Australian-American logistical organisation, under U.S. Brigadier General Dwight Johns, who in turn was answerable to Herring. Herring backed a plan to take American engineers off working on the airstrips {{in order to develop}} the port by building a causeway to Tatana Island, the successful completion of which doubled the port's capacity and was the logistical turning point of the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{overflow}} of the Arecibo River on October7, a neighborhood in Utuado {{was cut off}} from surrounding communities after gushing waters severely damaged its main road. Shortly thereafter, a landslide <b>lugged</b> a utility pole along the road, {{making it impossible for}} larger vehicles—including ambulances—to access the site. Landslides trapped fourteen families in the municipality of Ponce; a residence alongside a road suffered significant damage and had to be evacuated. In Cayey, a district was isolated from neighboring areas due to the collapse of a bridge. In the area, burst riverbanks triggered floods across local streets, which trapped dozens of families in their homes. Severe flooding contaminated water supplies, leaving an estimated 45,000 people without drinking water {{in the wake of the}} storm. In response, the government declared a state of emergency for the entire island. Authorities opened 120 shelters, and several flood victims had to be rescued.|$|E

40|$|Two sets of movable <b>lug</b> {{wheel with}} spring {{mechanism}} for hand tractors {{have been designed}} and tested. The wheels were set on local hand tractors and tested for tilling paddy fields in Cianjur and Subang districts, West Java. A local fixed <b>lug</b> wheel was also tested in each location. The movable <b>lug</b> wheel for Cianjur location was equipped {{with a pair of}} coiled type torsion springs on each <b>lug,</b> while the movable <b>lug</b> wheel for Subang location was equipped with a shaft type torsion spring on each <b>lug.</b> Field performances: theoretical and actual field capacities, wheel slip, and wheel shrinkage, were measured during the test. The test result in Cianjur showed that the movable <b>lug</b> wheel had a better traction performance than the fixed <b>lug</b> wheel. The average wheel slip of the movable <b>lug</b> wheel was 11. 54 %, while the average wheel slip of the fixed <b>lug</b> wheel was 20. 89 %. Field efficiency of the movable <b>lug</b> wheel was 76. 33 %, which was bigger than the fixed <b>lug</b> wheel (68. 45 %). However, the test result using shaft type torsion springs in Subang showed that the spring mechanism did not work well, and the spring mechanism should be modified on its torsion-shaft diameter and welding strength.

50|$|Some {{aftermarket}} wheels {{will only}} fit smaller <b>lug</b> nuts, or not allow an ordinary <b>lug</b> nut to be properly torqued down because a socket will {{not fit into}} the <b>lug</b> hole.

25|$|<b>Lugged</b> {{steel frame}} can be {{repaired}} {{more easily than}} MIG or TIG welded steel frames; a broken tube can be removed by the application of heat to un-braze (known as sweating) its joints, enabling tube replacement.|$|E
25|$|In most <b>lugged</b> steel frames, the lugs have {{a simple}} pointed shape. The lug's curves {{maximize}} {{the strength of the}} joint, while minimizing the possibility of stress risers, which would otherwise make the frame prone to cracking {{at the end of the}} lug.|$|E
25|$|From {{the late}} 19th century until the 1970s, {{this method of}} frame {{construction}} was favored because the lower temperatures of brazing (silver brazing in particular) had less of {{a negative impact on}} the tubing strength than high temperature welding, which can seriously weaken many steel alloys. Brazing thus allowed relatively thin walled, lightweight tubes to be used without loss of strength. However, recent advances in metallurgy have created steel tubing that is not adversely affected (or may even be improved) by high temperature welding. This has allowed both TIG and MIG welding to displace <b>lugged</b> steel construction, in large part because these methods lend themselves more easily to automation and reduce the cost by eliminating the lugs.|$|E
50|$|Wheels must {{be fitted}} {{with the correct}} type of <b>lug</b> nuts on wheel studs, or bolts. <b>Lug</b> nuts (aka wheel nuts in British English) are usually either flat, tapered (generally at 60 degrees and {{referred}} to as conical seat), or ball seats, meaning the mounting surfaces are flat, tapered, or spherical respectively.Most Mercedes have ball <b>lug</b> seats from the factory while most aftermarket wheels have a tapered <b>lug</b> design. Wrong <b>lug</b> nuts for the wheel will not properly center it and cause wobble. Some manufacturers (e.g. Toyota and Lexus) have used taper <b>lug</b> nuts for steel wheels and flat seated <b>lug</b> nuts for alloy wheels.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{of the effects of}} material and geometric variables on the response of U-shaped band-reinforced metallic <b>lugs</b> was performed.

Depending upon the reinforcement configuration the increase in load may be negligible to 15 or 20 percent. U-shaped band reinforcement increases <b>lug</b> load carrying capability primarily through two mechanisms; increasing the slope of the response curve after the initial knee and restraining overall deformation of the metallic portion of the <b>lug</b> facilitating increased yielding of metallic material between the hole and the edge of the metallic portion of the <b>lug...</b>|$|R
50|$|There was {{a problem}} {{including}} traditional built in <b>lugs</b> with the new stainless steel Amphibia case, so for the first case design, model 350, fixed <b>lugs</b> were added on. Later versions included attached <b>lugs</b> that swung before they incorporated integral <b>lugs</b> to the case. Later model cases include the integral <b>lug</b> model (420), the hexagon case, the ministry case (710), and the new curvy 060, and the tonneau/paddle model.|$|R
25|$|<b>Lugged</b> steel {{construction}} uses standard cylindrical steel tubes which are connected with lugs, external fittings made {{of pieces of}} steel (sometimes stainless steel) which fit over {{the ends of the}} tubing. Before assembly, the builder cuts the tubes to the desired length and precisely mitres their ends, providing a tight fit. The end of the tubes are inserted into the lugs and subsequently brazed with a silver or brass filler metal. The lug greatly increases the strength of the joint by distributing the molten filler metal over a larger surface area via capillary action. When brazing a bicycle frame, builders may use a small positioning structure called a jig to hold the tubes in place and maintain their precise alignment and frame geometry.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{we propose}} a precise 3 D <b>lug</b> pose {{detection}} sensor for automatic robot welding of a <b>lug</b> {{to a huge}} steel plate used in shipbuilding, where the <b>lug</b> is a handle to carry the huge steel plate. The proposed sensor consists of a camera and four laser line diodes, and its design parameters are determined by analyzing its detectable range and resolution. For the <b>lug</b> pose acquisition, four laser lines are projected on both <b>lug</b> and plate, and the projected lines are detected by the camera. For robust detection of the projected lines against the illumination change, the vertical threshold, thinning, Hough transform and separated Hough transform algorithms are successively applied to the camera image. The <b>lug</b> pose acquisition is carried out by two stages: the top view alignment and the side view alignment. The top view alignment is to detect the coarse <b>lug</b> pose relatively far from the <b>lug,</b> and the side view alignment is to detect the fine <b>lug</b> pose close to the <b>lug.</b> After the top view alignment, the robot is controlled to move close {{to the side of}} the <b>lug</b> for the side view alignment.

2500|$|<b>Lugged</b> {{steel frame}} {{construction}} is a method of building bicycle frames using steel tubing mated with socket-like sleeves, called lugs. [...] For most of the bicycle's history, steel has been the primary material for bicycle frames, with <b>lugged</b> construction the primary assembling method. [...] Steel continues in use by builders of high-quality steel frames, though its dominance as a frame material has waned since the mid-1990s displaced largely by aluminum and carbon fiber; lugging has been displaced by TIG welding.|$|E
2500|$|A classic type of {{construction}} for both road bicycles and mountain bicycles uses standard cylindrical steel tubes which are connected with lugs. Lugs are fittings made of thicker pieces of steel. [...] The tubes are fitted into the lugs, which encircle {{the end of the}} tube, and are then brazed to the lug. [...] Historically, the lower temperatures associated with brazing (silver brazing in particular) had less of a negative impact on the tubing strength than high temperature welding, allowing relatively light tube to be used without loss of strength. [...] Recent advances in metallurgy ("Air-hardening steel") have created tubing that is not adversely affected, or whose properties are even improved by high temperature welding temperatures, which has allowed both TIG & MIG welding to sideline <b>lugged</b> construction in all but a few high end bicycles. [...] More expensive <b>lugged</b> frame bicycles have lugs which are filed by hand into fancy shapes - both for weight savings and as a sign of craftsmanship. [...] Unlike MIG or TIG welded frames, a <b>lugged</b> frame can be more easily repaired in the field due to its simple construction.

50|$|Traditional stamped <b>lugs</b> (aka pressed <b>lugs)</b> {{are formed}} by {{pressing}} sheet steel over a mandrel, bending them to shape, and then welding the seams.

40|$|Defects are {{produced}} when lifting <b>lugs</b> being welded on ship sections during the building process. The {{large amount of}} heat produced in the welding work causes “heat affected zone” in the base metal on sections and destroys painted coatings on the plates; and residual stress decreases the mechanical performance of the steel plates. To eliminate the defects, it is hypothesized that “structural adhesive bonding” can replace welding for installing lifting <b>lugs</b> to some extent. An investigation of the application of adhesively bonded lifting <b>lugs</b> in ship building is processed to give methods for the application and check the feasibility of replacing welded lifting <b>lugs</b> with adhesively bonded lifting <b>lugs.</b> In the research, a serious of rules for adhesively bonded lifting <b>lugs</b> is adapted from rules for welded lifting lugs; “structural adhesives”, “adhesive bonding joints”, “the shape and geometry of lifting lugs” and “positions for installation” are investigated. Then adhesively bonded lifting <b>lugs</b> are designed based on the adapted rules; and then improved after the evaluation by FEM simulation. The results show that adhesively bonded lifting <b>lugs</b> can replace welding lifting <b>lugs</b> with high probability when the capacity is less than 20 ton; when the capacity is between 20 ton and 30 ton, limitations such as “not enough bonding area” and “no positions for installation” constrain the replacement.
