5|$|The {{reproductive}} system of females consist of paired ovaries, <b>lateral</b> oviducts, spermatheca, and a genital chamber.

The ovaries are primitive {{in that they are}} polytrophic (the nurse cells and oocytes alternate {{along the length of the}} ovariole).

When the skull of Majungasaurus is rotated so that its <b>lateral</b> canal is parallel to the ground, the entire skull is nearly horizontal. This contrasts with many other theropods, where the head was more strongly downturned when in the alert position. The <b>lateral</b> canal is also significantly longer in Majungasaurus than in its more basal relative Ceratosaurus, indicating a greater sensitivity to side-to-side motions of the head.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the possibility of}} hydraulic characterization of radial well <b>laterals</b> {{in a manner that}} does not require prior hydrodynamic analysis by simulating groundwater extraction conditions on a numerical model. The first step of the proposed approach is to assess the groundwater level regime formed in the capture zone when the well is operating, which is indicative of the functional condition of the <b>laterals</b> and the aquifer potential in terms of groundwater availability. Then the efficiency of the <b>laterals</b> is examined through the hydraulic function of the skin zone, depending on its filtration properties. An expression for groundwater flow from the aquifer to the <b>laterals</b> (commonly used to simulate <b>laterals</b> on a hydrodynamic model) is employed to define representative values of the conductance coefficient of the skin zone (as an indicator of colmation), and then applied to several wells at Belgrade Groundwater Source. The present research shows that a conductance coefficient of [Ks/ds]= 1. 0 × 10 - 4 s- 1 can be considered as the threshold value in relation to which the effects of colmation of well <b>laterals</b> are exhibited, which is consistent with the results reported by researchers who studied the effect of skin zone conductance on the occurrence and nature of the so-called early drawdown at radial collector wells. In addition to gaining insight into the present condition of the <b>laterals,</b> the proposed approach can be used to study the progress of colmation at different points in time and to quantify the effectiveness of regeneration of <b>laterals.</b> [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br.

25|$|Many {{aboriginal}} Australian languages have {{a series}} of three or four <b>lateral</b> approximants, as do various dialects of Irish. Rarer <b>lateral</b> consonants include the retroflex laterals that can be found in many languages of India and in some Swedish dialects, and the voiceless alveolar <b>lateral</b> fricative , found in many Native North American languages, Welsh and Zulu. In Adyghe and some Athabaskan languages like Hän, both voiceless and voiced alveolar <b>lateral</b> fricatives occur, but there is no approximant. Many of these languages also have <b>lateral</b> affricates. Some languages have palatal or velar voiceless <b>lateral</b> fricatives or affricates, such as Dahalo and Zulu, but the IPA has no symbols for such sounds. However, appropriate symbols are easy to make by adding a lateral-fricative belt to the symbol for the corresponding <b>lateral</b> approximant (see below). Also, a devoicing diacritic may be added to the approximant.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: An {{association}} of Dasycladalean algae is identifi ed from the Lower Eocene (Ilerdian–Cuisian) of the Seyitgazi area, Western Anatolia. Th e association consists mostly {{of the genus}} Belzungia Morellet and Anatolia n. gen. Th is is the fi rst discovery of such a rich and diversifi ed dasycladalean fl ora with Belzungia in the Eocene of Central Tethys. Th e genus Belzungia is represented by four species: Belzungia terquemi Morellet, B. silvestrii (Pfender), B. bella (Ju Ying) Radoičić and B. pfenderae n. sp. Belzungia articles consist of whorls characterized by an assemblage of <b>laterals,</b> in the transversal section of which, the primary <b>laterals</b> are distally enlarged (sub-triangular in shape), whereas in the vertical section, they are fl at. Cylindrical <b>laterals</b> of younger order are somewhat irregular or, in some species, they may be of more or less anarchic arrangement. Th e <b>laterals</b> of some orders, even in the same assemblage, oft en vary in size. <b>Laterals</b> of the sixth order are commonly interlaced, but are seldom preserved.
