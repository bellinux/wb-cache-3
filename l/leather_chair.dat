500|$|The trial {{opened on}} 1 June 1891. Ticket holders began queuing at 9:30am, {{and the court}} was full {{half an hour before}} its 11am start time. The prince sat on a red <b>leather</b> <b>chair</b> on a raised {{platform}} between the judge and the witness box; his appearance was the first time since 1411 that an heir to the throne had appeared involuntarily in court. The Pall Mall Gazette stated that [...] "the court presented an appearance which, save for the dignity of its own fittings and its rows of learned-looking law books, might have been taken for a theatre at a fashionable matinée", with society ladies watching proceedings with opera glasses or lorgnettes. The correspondent of The Manchester Guardian described the opening of the case as being [...] "in the presence of a carefully selected and fashionable assembly", while Clarke later wrote that [...] "the court had a strange appearance. Lord Coleridge had appropriated half of the public gallery, and had given tickets to his friends".|$|E
2500|$|Describing the {{increase}} in his rate of killing in the two months prior to his arrest, he stated he had been [...] "completely swept along" [...] with his compulsion to kill, adding: [...] "It was an incessant and never-ending desire to be with someone at whatever cost. Someone good looking, really nice looking. It just filled my thoughts all day long." [...] When asked {{as to why he}} had preserved a total of seven skulls and the entire skeletons of two victims, Dahmer stated {{he had been in the}} process of constructing a private altar of victims' skulls which he had intended to adorn upon the black table located in his living room and upon which he had photographed the bodies of many of his victims. This display of skulls was to be adorned at each side with the complete skeletons of Ernest Miller and Oliver Lacy. The four severed heads found in his kitchen were to be removed of all flesh and used in this altar, as was the skull of at least one future victim. Incense sticks were to be placed at each end of the black table, above which Dahmer intended to place a large blue lamp with extending blue globe lights. The entire construction was to be placed before a window covered with a black, opaque shower curtain, in front of which Dahmer intended to sit in a black <b>leather</b> <b>chair.</b> When asked in a November 18, 1991 interview who the altar was dedicated to, Dahmer replied: [...] "Myself ... It was a place where I could feel at home." [...] He further described his intended altar as a [...] "place for meditation," [...] from where he believed he could draw a sense of power, adding: [...] "If this [...] had happened six months later, that's what they would have found." ...|$|E
