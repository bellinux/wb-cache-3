40|$|The overall aim of {{the project}} was to provide {{decision-makers}} with a tool allowing them to rationally plan traffic noise control measures including <b>low-noise</b> road <b>surfaces.</b> That tool, actually the final output from the project, is a “Guidance Manual for the Implementation of Low-Noise Road Surfaces”. It is a compilation of the key research and findings from the entire component Work Packages within the project. The Manual is split into 6 parts. Part 1 summarises the basics about noise in general and vehicle noise and tyre/road noise, in particular, in order to provide the reader with the necessary background to the topic. Part 2 presents an overview of the different low-noise solutions for pavements, including well-established surface types and technologies which are relatively new or under development, some of which have been tested within the SilVia project. It also reviews construction and maintenance techniques used for <b>low-noise</b> <b>surfaces</b> and addresses the possibilities of improving the acoustic performance and durability of <b>low-noise</b> road <b>surfaces.</b> Part 3 first summarises the different measurement methods that are available for the evaluation of the acoustic performance of a road surface, particularly for labelling and conformity-of-production (COP) assessment. The essentia...|$|R
40|$|In {{almost all}} urban {{contexts}} {{and in many}} extra-urban conurbations, where road traffic is the main noise pollution source, the use of barriers is not allowed. In these cases, <b>low-noise</b> road <b>surfaces</b> are the most used mitigation action together with traffic flow reduction. Selecting the optimal surface {{is only the first}} problem that the public administration has to face. In the second place, it has to consider the issue of assessing the efficacy of the mitigation action. The purpose of the LEOPOLDO project was to improve the knowledge in the design and the characterization of <b>low-noise</b> road <b>surfaces,</b> producing guidelines helpful to the public administrations. Several experimental road surfaces were tested. Moreover, several measurement methods were implemented aiming to select those that are suitable for a correct assessment of the pavement performances laid as mitigation planning. In this paper, the experience gained in the LEOPOLDO project will be described, focusing on both the measurement methods adopted to assess the performance of a <b>low-noise</b> road <b>surface</b> and the criteria by which the experimental results have to be evaluated, presenting a comparison of the obtained results and their monitoring along time...|$|R
40|$|Noise is everywhere. Noise is a {{sound that}} makes people {{stressful}} and irritate. It often couses sleep disorders and also health problems like different cardiovascular disorders, hearing loss…In most cases traffic noise is the most disturbing. There are different ways to prevent people from traffic noise like building noise barriers and insulation of facades. However noise barriers and insulation of facades do not prevent noise formation, but are lowering existing noise. Another disadvantage is expensive construction of noise barriers and fascade insulations. Way to prevent formation of noise is construction of <b>low-noise</b> road <b>surfaces.</b> In the paper we have presented different properties that effect on formation tyre – road noise, noise comparison of different surfaces and latest findings in building <b>low-noise</b> road <b>surfaces...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{task of the}} master's {{thesis is}} {{introduction}} {{with the problems of}} traffic noise, focusing on noise from road traffic. There is a description what is the noise, how it is formed, its resources and what are the methods of measuring. The following are the various noise reduction measures such as noise barriers and low noise pavements. The main attention is devoted to the noise generated at the tire / road that is reduced by these pavements. The practical part describes the implemented measurements on individual sections at various locations in our country. The measurement was carried by slightly modified method CPX with reference tire directly at the vehicle. The main aim was to evaluate the measurement data, make comparison of different <b>low-noise</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{with each other and with}} the commonly used surfaces. Then quantification of the rate reduction of the noise emission for a given section and verification of input data for noise modeling. In conclusion, the obtained results are summarized and based on them were confirmed very good acoustic properties with the recommendation to continue with measurements in the future...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Traffic {{noise is}} a {{particular}} threat to the environment {{in the vicinity of}} roads. The level of the noise is influenced by traffic density and traffic composition, as well as vehicle speed and the type of surface. The article presents the results of studies on tire/road noise from passing vehicles at a speed of 40 – 80 kph, carried out by using the statistical pass-by method (SPB), on seven surfaces with different characteristics. It has been shown that increasing the speed from 40 kph to 50 kph contributes to the increase in the maximum A-weighted sound pressure level by about 3 dB, regardless of the type of surface. For larger differences in speed (30 kph– 40 kph) increase in noise levels reaches values about 10 dB. In the case of higher speeds, this increase is slightly lower. In this article, special attention is paid to the noisiness from surfaces made of porous asphalt concrete (PAC), BBTM (thin asphalt layer), and stone mastic asphalt (SMA) with a maximum aggregate size of 8 mm and 5 mm. It has also been proved that surfaces of porous asphalt concrete, within two years after the commissioning, significantly contribute to a reduction of the maximum level of noise in the streets and roads with lower speed of passing cars. Reduction of the maximum A-weighted sound pressure level of a statistical car traveling at 60 kph reaches values of up to about 6 dB, as compared with the SMA 11. Along with the exploitation of the road, air voids in the <b>low-noise</b> <b>surface</b> becomes clogged and acoustic properties of the road decrease to a level similar to standard asphalt...|$|R
25|$|The town's {{location}} {{at the intersection}} of the routes from London to Bristol and from Southampton to Birmingham made it, for many years, a transport bottleneck. In 1963 a Dual Carriageway was built east of the town centre to ease congestion and the opening of the M4 in 1971 moved the intersection of these major trunk routes three miles north of the town, to Chieveley. The ring road around the town still suffered serious congestion and the Newbury bypass was proposed in 1981. The plans were approved in 1990. However they were extremely controversial and this led to a major environmentalist campaign opposing the road development (dubbed the Third Battle of Newbury by parts of the national media). In spite of this, the road was built and finally opened in 1998. Within two months the road surface began to break up and {{the entire length of the}} bypass was eventually resurfaced over two weekends using an improved <b>low-noise</b> water-absorbent <b>surface.</b>|$|R
40|$|Poroelastic {{road surface}} (PERS) {{is a type}} of <b>low-noise</b> {{pavement}} <b>surface,</b> which was derived from porous asphalt (PA). Because of its high elasticity, large air void content and an inter-connected air void structure, PERS provides excellent performance in traffic noise reduction. However, it also faces the challenging problem of poor ravelling resistance, which limits its more widespread application. The main objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the effects of various composition factors on the ravelling resistance of PERS so as to provide recommendations on appropriate PERS composition. To this end, 20 PERS mixtures with different compositions were designed and characterized after various stages of polishing applied by the Aachener-Raveling-Tester (ARTe). The ravelling resistance of PERS was quantified by measuring the material loss after polishing, while their acoustic performance and rutting resistance were also tested for validation purpose. It was concluded that binder content and degree of compaction are the critical factors affecting the ravelling resistance of PERS. To ensure sufficient durability, a minimum binder content of 15 % and a minimum compaction degree of 98 % were recommended. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn Germany, diamond {{grinding}} {{is frequently}} {{used to improve}} the evenness and skid resistance of concrete pavement surfaces. Since diamond grinding has been observed to affect tyre/pavement noise emission favourably, the relationship among surface texture, concrete composition and noise emission of concrete pavement surfaces has been systematically investigated. The simulation program SPERoN was used in a parameter study to investigate the main factors which affect noise emission. Based {{on the results of}} the simulations, textured concrete surfaces were produced by using a laboratory grinding machine. As well as the composition of the concrete, the thickness and spacing of the diamond blades were varied. The ability of the textured surfaces to reduce noise emission was assessed from the texture characteristics and air flow resistance of textured surfaces measured in the laboratory. It was found that concrete composition and, in particular, the spacing of the blades affected the reduction in noise emission considerably. The noise emission behaviour of numerous road sections was also considered in field investigations. The pavement surfaces had been textured by diamond grinding during the last years or decades. The results show that diamond grinding is able to provide good, durable noise-reducing properties. Several new pavement sections were investigated using thicknesses and spacings of the blades similar to those used in the laboratory to optimize noise emission reduction. It is concluded that diamond grinding is a good alternative to exposed aggregate concrete for the production of <b>low-noise</b> pavement <b>surfaces...</b>|$|R
40|$|At this conference, {{the subject}} of tyre/road noise is on the agenda {{to a greater extent}} than ever before. This paper aims at giving an insight into the past, present and future of tyre/road noise {{emission}} in the society as well as its control. This is made by means of exploring some myths and realities related to the subject. The following myths are explored: 1. Tyre/road noise has become a concern only during the last decades, say from the 1970 's. It is shown that already long ago tyre/road noise was an important issue. 2. Tyre/road noise is an important part of vehicle noise at speeds above 50 km/h (70 for trucks). The truth is that nowadays tyre/road noise dominates during almost all types of driving for cars and down to about 40 km/h for trucks (vehicles meeting EU requirements). 3. Manufacturers have done a lot to reduce vehicle and tyre/road noise. Yes, in some respects; but yet it seems that vehicle noise sometimes has increased rather than decreased. 4. The speed influence is large but not very interesting. It is shown that there are unexpected relations between speed-related factors and that these can be useful in data presentation. 5. Different road surfaces may give a large variation in noise levels. True, the variation is very large, albeit the most common and useful surfaces are close together on the noise scale. 6. Tyres do not differ very much in noise emission. This is not true, the variation is large if sufficiently many tyre types are included in the data set. 7. Winter tyres are much more noisy than summer tyres. This is a myth based on the past. Currently, winter tyres may be the "quiet" tyres. 8. The width of the tyre is a very influential factor. Essentially true: A noise-width relation covering the range from "tiny" bicycle tyres to large truck tyres is presented. 9. Tyre/road noise from a heavy truck is far above that of a typical car. Not true, one may find heavy trucks that emit lower tyre/road noise than some cars. 10. Tyre/road noise is very broadband nowadays. True and not true - current tyres emit noise very much concentrated within the 1 kHz octave. Tone correction may be considered. 11. Quiet tyres are possible only if sacrificing safety. Recent results show that there is no tradeoff between low noise emission and high safety; neither with rolling resistance. 12. We cannot afford to reduce tyre/road noise. Calculation exercises are presented that suggest that low-noise tyres as well as <b>low-noise</b> road <b>surfaces</b> may be very cost efficient. 13. Tyre/road noise will be substantially reduced by the introduction of noise emission limits. Not true; the new EU emission tyre noise limits will be almost totally ineffective...|$|R
