500|$|In February 2008, Seyfried {{was cast}} as Anita [...] "Needy" [...] Lesnicki, the [...] "plain Jane" [...] best friend to Fox's {{character}} {{with whom she}} shares a somewhat lesbian infatuation. Seyfried {{said it was a}} relief to play the nerdy character opposite Fox. [...] "Being a lead (like Megan), you have that weird pressure of feeling <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> look attractive," [...] she stated. [...] "In this movie, I didn't worry about any of that [...] I don't want to play the one that everybody is supposed to want to have sex with." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{inspiration}} {{is taken}} from my own life, but also all my girlfriends who are very strong, confident girls {{who want to be}} their best in all levels of life. They’re kind of like overachievers and never seem to be satisfied with how [...] they achieve in life. I can see that with myself as well because you expect so much from yourself. You expect yourself to be the best friend, have a great career, be really talented and be able to cook—you just have to be great at everything. I think genders have been washed out a little bit -- <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> have masculine qualities as well as feminine. It’s just a song that recognizes {{what it takes to be}} a girl today, and it’s quite a lot.|$|E
2500|$|I {{was trying}} to keep it close to the vest {{throughout}} the release. Paul Walker used to say that [...] was guaranteed. And in some ways, when your brother guarantees something, you sometimes feel <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make sure it comes to pass... so if fate has it, then you’ll get this when you hear about it. [...] was for Paul, [...] is from Paul.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sorry. It's too bad a sweet kid <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> work. You're not strong, Rose.... Well, I'll {{turn off}} at this corner. You won't meet me to-night?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The fact is, Tifto, {{you don't}} make enough out of it. When {{a small man}} <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> deal with a big man like that, he may {{take it out of}} him in one of two ways. But he must be deuced clever if he can get it both ways." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a shame {{for a girl}} <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do this," [...] he was saying, {{apparently}} in repetition {{of what he had}} already urged. [...] "Come on an' say the word, Saxon. Come on an' say the word." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} for you," [...] said the minister; [...] "yet to a youth of your frame of character, of your ability I will say, and your {{requisition}} for something profound in {{the grounds of}} your belief, {{it is not unusual}} to meet this trouble. Men <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fight for their faith. They fight in the first place to win it, and ever afterwards to hold it. The Devil tilts with them daily and often seems to win." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, Richard," [...] {{interposed}} Gilbert of Gloucester, [...] "this is {{an unlikely}} tale. You {{can have no}} cause for secresy, save in connection with these brothers; and if you will point to some way of clearing yourself of being art and part in this foul act of murder, you may be sent scot free from the camp; but if you wilfully maintain this denial, {{what can we do}} but treat you as a traitor? No obstinacy! What can a lad <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say to good old Sir Robert Darcy, that all the world might not know?" ...|$|E
6000|$|So {{it is with}} us, when we {{look out}} from our {{scientific}} handicrafts upon the doings of our learned brethren, whose work is untrammelled by anything [...] "base and mechanical," [...] as handicrafts {{used to be called}} when the world was younger, and, in some respects, less wise than now. We take the greatest interest in their pursuits; we are edified by their histories and are charmed with their poems, which sometimes illustrate so remarkably the powers of man's imagination; some of us admire and even humbly try to follow them in their high philosophical excursions, though we know the risk of being snubbed by the inquiry whether grovelling dissectors of monkeys and blackbeetles can hope to enter into the empyreal kingdom of speculation. But still we feel that our business is different; humbler if you will, though the diminution of dignity is, perhaps, compensated by the increase of reality; and that we, <b>like</b> <b>you,</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> get our work done in a region where little avails, if the power of dealing with practical tangible facts is wanting. You know that clever talk touching joinery will not make a chair; and I know that it is of about as much value in the physical sciences. Mother Nature is serenely obdurate to honeyed words; only those who understand the ways of things, and can silently and effectually handle them, get any good out of her.|$|E
2500|$|The tracklist for The Road Chronicles visualette DVD is very {{different}} from the LP release. Amos stated: [...] "I think the visualettes connect [...] as well. The order is different though, which was very intentional. The order of the visual side of things is different than if you're just putting the sonic thing on headphones and taking a walk. I felt <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> experience it very, {{very different}}ly." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jeff: [...] "You know, maybe I {{was wrong}} and luck is <b>like</b> love. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{go all the way}} to find it." ...|$|R
60|$|It is strange: he was {{the only}} man I ever loved who did not habitually interrupt. The fact draws my own portrait. And {{it is one of the}} many reasons why I count myself honoured by his friendship. A man <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>like</b> me; <b>you</b> could not help yourself; but Ferrier was above me, we were not equals; his true self humoured and smiled paternally upon my failings, even as I humoured and sorrowed over his.|$|R
6000|$|This is the reason: That the English {{have laws}} and obey them, and the gipsies have none. This {{is the whole}} secret. This is why savages remain poor and miserable, that each man does what he likes without law. This is why civilised nations like England thrive and prosper, because they have laws and obey them, and every man does not do what he likes, but what the law likes. Laws are made not {{for the good of}} one person here, or the other person there, but for the good of all; and, therefore, the very notion of a civilised country is, a country in which people cannot do what they like with their own, as the savages do. [...] "Not do what he likes with his own?" [...] Certainly not; no one can or does. If you have property, you cannot spend it all as you <b>like.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pay a part of it to the government, that is, into the common stock, for the common good, in the shape of rates and taxes, before you can spend any of it on {{yourself}}. If you take wages, you cannot spend them all upon yourself and do what you like with them. If you do not support your wife and family out of them, the law will punish you. You cannot do what you like with your own gun, for you may not shoot your neighbour's cattle or game with it. You cannot do what you like with your own hands, for the law forbids you to steal with them. You cannot do what you like with your own feet, for the law will punish you for trespassing on your neighbour's ground without his leave. In short, you can only do with your own what will not hurt your neighbour, in such matters as the law can take care of. And more, in any great necessity the law may actually hurt you {{for the good of the}} nation at large. The law may compel you to sell your land, to your own injury, if it is wanted for a railroad. The law may compel you, as it did fifty years ago, to serve as a soldier in the militia, to your own injury, if there is a fear of foreign invasion; so that the law is above each and all of us. Our own wills are not our masters. No man is his own master. The law is the master of each and all of us, and if we will not obey it willingly, it can make us obey unwillingly.|$|E
5000|$|There is a {{complete}} absence of pretension with Cicely. You never feel <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> rise to her level, nor does she come to you… it’s all about the work. Michael Attenborough, director ...|$|E
5000|$|Be sympathetic; Others, like you, {{want to be}} rich. Do {{not seek}} self-interest at expense of others' interest. Others, <b>like</b> <b>you,</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{struggle}} to earn their living. Do not earn your living at expense of others' interest.|$|E
3000|$|... …if I go {{to these}} people and ask them: which problem would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> solved in 5 [*]years? What would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> in 5 [*]years? […You] do not get an answer. […T]he {{industrial}} perspective is maybe a year.|$|R

5000|$|... "I {{think the}} Buzzcocks left {{the stage and}} the {{microphone}} was there and a little voice must have been calling 'This is your moment, Jon.' I've no idea to this day why I sang 'Louie Louie', the ultimate garage anthem from the 60s. And why I did it a cappella and changed all the lyrics apart from the actual chorus, I have no idea. I suppose it was my bid for immortality, one of those great bolts of inspiration." [...] "For some reason it appeared to go down rather well. I suppose it was taking the punk ethos to the extreme - anyone can have a go. Before punk it was <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a double degree in music. It was a liberation for someone like me who was totally unmusical but wanted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a go." ...|$|R
50|$|Before {{we kind of}} assumed {{certain things}} about Corvo, but that’s the {{strength}} and weakness of giving them a voice. Sometimes he says something {{and it might be}} different than what you assumed about him. He has a more assertive personality than before, so I feel <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> know the character a bit better to write lines for him now.|$|E
50|$|I {{was trying}} to keep it close to the vest {{throughout}} the release. Paul Walker used to say that eighth film was guaranteed. And in some ways, when your brother guarantees something, you sometimes feel <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make sure it comes to pass... so if fate has it, then you’ll get this when you hear about it. Furious 7 was for Paul, eighth film is from Paul.|$|E
50|$|Normally with my {{cartoons}} I {{try to use}} {{humor to}} get across my point. After Sept. 11th, you just couldn't use humor. The tragedy was so enormous, you couldn't be funny. It's almost <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> come up with cartoons using {{a different part of}} your brain. I was just {{trying to come up with}} images that expressed the emotions that I was feeling and tried to focus in on different aspects of the tragedy that I thought were important.|$|E

5000|$|... "He {{works out}} of the downstairs bit of his house and there's a pool out the back, which is great when you're {{recording}} in summer, because we started in January, and it's blistering hot in Brisbane. We'd record for two hours then have a swim and keep recorded…it was great! I think that sort of environment its conducive {{for us to do}} good work. We just feel really comfortable; it's the way we operate. You're not on the clock like you are in a major studio, you don't feel <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> hurry…we just went in and recorded when we could. It was a really nice process." ...|$|E
50|$|Dynamic cache {{control has}} more options to {{configure}} caching, such as cookie-based cache control, {{that allows you}} to serve content from cache, based on the presence or lack of certain cookies. A cookie stores the unique identifier-key of a logged-in user on their device, and it's already implemented for authenticating users upon execution of any page that opens a session; in a dynamic caching system, the caches are referred to by URL and additionally the various cookie keys, so it allows you to simply enable serving of default caches to anonymous users and personalized caches to logged-in users (without forcing you to modify your code, to make it append additional user identifiers to the URL, <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> with a static caching system).|$|E

5000|$|Tuff's First Two Buck Offs. It was 1993 and Tuff {{was well}} on his way to a Hall of Fame career and earning his {{reputation}} as King of the Bull Riders. Simultaneously, Bodacious was gaining his reputation as an 1,800 pound master of disaster. [...] "The first time I had him was at a bull riding event in Memphis, Tennessee," [...] Hedeman said. [...] "He was unbelievable. When he left the chute his front end came up so high. I was right in the middle of him, and riding him <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> ride a bull with a lot of downdraft. But my chest was touching his horns, and my head was right over the top of his. I couldn't keep my hand in the rope." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} by PopBuzz, {{when asked about}} the inspo behind 'The Line', Raye said [...] "I remember being in the line for a club a few years back and I had my favourite trainers on and a t-shirt and it took me ages to get ready. I was queued up for ages and then the bouncer at the door was like [...] "no, you're not coming in". So I was so upset...and then I kinda looked around and I saw the females in the club world, the way girls are expected to dress and behave, it's just so outdated and so boring. <b>Like</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wear heels and dresses and look really formal and blah, blah, blah. So I was really upset about it so I wrote the song, that's kinda the inspiration behind it." ...|$|E
5000|$|He {{frequently}} {{speaks of}} developing and being drawn to dualism in his characters. [...] "If I'm offered {{the role of}} the hero, I immediately look for the antihero within!... I see everything in terms of an outer skin and an inner skin." [...] He creates [...] "character diaries" [...] with entire biographies for the characters he plays. [...] "It was important to me to put in a background for my character that would be useful for the whole journey. A lot of that is secret and no one gets to read that. It's what is useful to me. If you are playing something long-running and a role that has a future the initial series, it's almost <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> plant a garden which you will need to come back to at some point. If you don't put in early, it can jar with you." ...|$|E
