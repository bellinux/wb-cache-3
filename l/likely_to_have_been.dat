50|$|According to a {{hypothesis}} of the Egyptologist John D. Ray, upon {{the death of}} Nepherites I in 393 BC, the throne passed to his son and successor, which <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> Hakor. However, it seems that in his Year 2 an usurper, Psammuthes (an hellenized form of the Egyptian name Pasherienmut), seized power and deposed Hakor, while proclaiming himself pharaoh.|$|R

5|$|There are {{two main}} issues {{concerning}} the locomotory abilities of Tyrannosaurus: how well it could turn; and what its maximum straight-line speed was <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been.</b> Both {{are relevant to the}} debate about whether it was a hunter or a scavenger.|$|E
5|$|A {{fluxgate}} gradiometer {{survey in}} July 2009 investigated standing stones {{in the garden}} of the Druids Arms public house known as The Cove, which showed that the stones date from nearly a thousand years before the stone circles. The conclusion from the study was that these upright stones are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the portals or façade of a chambered tomb.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists {{believe that}} the brick shrine was {{destroyed}} either by a cyclone or a tsunami which took place 2,200 years ago. The Pallavas built a granite temple on the brick foundation in the 8th century AD, which also was <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> destroyed by a tsunami. Archaeologists {{believe that the}} second tsunami must {{have occurred in the}} 13th century AD as the latest inscriptions which speak of the shrine have been dated to 1215.|$|E
50|$|Documentation of {{traditional}} camu camu uses is scarce. In traditional Amazonian societies, camu camu <b>is</b> not <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> ever <b>been</b> nutritionally relevant.

25|$|Between the Powell Avenue and Broadway/ Plainview Road {{interchanges}} {{along the}} expressway, the highway is divided {{with a large}} median. The lane alignment was set up so that the proposed extension of the Bethpage State Parkway would have run within the median of NY135. The parkway would have followed the highway for a short distance before turning to the southeast and away from NY135. By making this possible, the Bethpage Parkway would <b>likely</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> upgraded from its current super-two configuration into a four-lane highway.|$|R

5|$|In April 1705, Queen Anne knighted Newton {{during a}} royal visit to Trinity College, Cambridge. The knighthood is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{motivated}} by political considerations {{connected with the}} Parliamentary election in May 1705, rather than any recognition of Newton's scientific work or services as Master of the Mint. Newton was the second scientist to be knighted, after Sir Francis Bacon.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} fourth {{millennium}} BC the track was built between an island at Westhay and a ridge of high ground at Shapwick {{close to the}} River Brue. A group of mounds at Westhay mark the site of prehistoric lake dwellings, which were <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{similar to those found}} in the Iron Age Glastonbury Lake Village near Godney, itself built on a morass on an artificial foundation of timber filled with brushwood, bracken, rubble, and clay.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} how {{effective}} the Caesar cipher {{was at the}} time, but it is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> reasonably secure, not least because most of Caesar's enemies would have been illiterate and others would have assumed that the messages were written in an unknown foreign language. There is no record {{at that time of}} any techniques for the solution of simple substitution ciphers. The earliest surviving records date to the 9th century works of Al-Kindi in the Arab world with the discovery of frequency analysis.|$|E
25|$|A British {{longitudinal}} study {{has found that}} obesity restricted <b>to</b> childhood <b>has</b> minimal influence on adult outcomes at age 30.

30|$|As {{can be seen}} in Table  6, {{there are}} {{significant}} differences between the characteristics of the head of split households that were found, and those that attrited. Households that attrited <b>were</b> more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> male heads. Attrited split households <b>were</b> more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a new head age 35 – 64, and less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a new head 15 – 24 or 25 – 34. Split households that were not found <b>were</b> more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> heads who <b>were</b> married, but less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> heads that <b>were</b> single or divorced. Split households with female heads that were not found were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be separated.|$|R
5|$|It {{was widely}} {{believed}} the film would win {{most of its}} Oscar nominations, but it received only the award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay), shared by Welles and Mankiewicz.

5|$|Lastly, {{he played}} {{at least some}} part in the {{establishment}} of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, passing the cipher manuscripts from which it was founded to his friend William Wynn Westcott shortly before his death. He had already made a strong case that the mystic and philosophical elements which allowed Freemasonry to evolve from a purely operative to a speculative society were <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> imported from some aspects of the Hermeticism practised during the Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|Mozart did {{not write}} down a cadenza for the movement, or at least there is no {{evidence}} of him having done so. Many later composers and performers, including Johannes Brahms, Ferruccio Busoni and Gabriel Fauré, have composed their own. Uniquely among Mozart's concertos, the score does not direct the soloist to end the cadenza with a cadential trill. The omission of the customary trill is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> deliberate, with Mozart choosing to have the cadenza connect directly to the coda without one.|$|E
50|$|Max: He's first {{appeared}} in the Sixteen (26) (Chapter 1 - #113). He appears as the deputy head of Internal Affairs and he led a group that was against captain Gatsu in the Internal Affairs. He commands the execution of Edel, against Gatsu who escaped Edel to escape Balak, but after he has seen the evidence of Toshka case, he refuses to kills Balak, and persuades Gatsu to betray and act together. He has two fists separated from his body and has the Quanx ability to separate and move the body. He's presumed {{to be one of the}} 'two white rats' that Balak said he <b>has</b> got <b>to</b> hunt down, so 7 years later, he <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> handled by Balak, the director of Internal Affairs.|$|R
50|$|During its latter years, the Banu Marwan's statelet faced a {{major threat}} from reconquista-focused Christian kings from {{emergent}} states in the north. While Marvão <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> not <b>been</b> attacked in the raids of the king of León Ordoño II in 913 (which ransacked Evora to the south), it <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> suffered during raids during Ordoño II´s campaign to sack Mérida in 913.|$|R

5|$|Paleontologist Peter Mackovicky {{commented on}} the Manning team's study, stating that small, {{primitive}} dromaeosaurids (such as Microraptor) were <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> tree-climbers, but that climbing did not explain why later, gigantic dromaeosaurids such as Achillobator retained highly curved claws when they were too large to have climbed trees. Mackovicky speculated that giant dromaeosaurids may have adapted the claw to be used exclusively for latching on to prey.|$|E
5|$|Reconstructions of ankylosaur forelimb {{musculature}} made by Coombs in 1978 {{suggest that}} the forelimbs bore {{the majority of the}} animal's weight, and were adapted for high force delivery on the front feet, possibly for food gathering. In addition, Coombs suggested that ankylosaurs may have been capable diggers, though the hoof-like structure of the manus would have limited fossorial activity. Ankylosaurs were <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> slow-moving and sluggish animals, though they may have been capable of quick movements when necessary.|$|E

50|$|Data {{of violent}} crimes that <b>were</b> {{confirmed}} or <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> committed by gangs were geocoded and matched with the gang territorial map. This data {{was obtained from}} the Boston Police Department for the year of 1994. It is through geocoding and the overlapping the gang territorial map that major concentrations of crime were identified. The ratios of violence incidents were significantly higher under gang areas of operations in contrast to areas free of gang presence. However, not all gangs were equal generators crime or practitioners of the same criminal offenses. Additionally, STAC program was utilize to create hotspot ellipses in order to measure the crime distribution density. It reinforced the previous results that some gangs’ territory experience the higher rates of crime. The crime hotspots located in the regions could then be further analyzed for its unique crime concentration pattern.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Objectives. To {{estimate}} {{the proportion of}} US children that have a written asthma action plan (WAAP) at home and school and the association of asthma control and medication use behaviors. Design. A cross-sectional analysis of the 2010 child Asthma Call Back Survey (ACBS). Results. Among the ACBS survey participants, 44. 5 % (95 % CI= 40. 5 - 48. 7) were ever given a WAAP and 34. 4 % (95 % CI= 30. 4 - 38. 6) had a WAAP at school. Children that <b>had</b> routine care <b>were</b> more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> ever <b>been</b> given a WAAP (adjusted relative risk (aRR) 1. 8, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 2. 9) and <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a WAAP at school (ARR 4. 1, 95 % CI= 2. 7 - 6. 1). Children with not well-controlled asthma <b>were</b> more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> ever <b>been</b> given a WAAP (ARR 1. 6, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 2. 3) and <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a WAAP at school (ARR 1. 8, 95 % CI 1. 2 - 2. 7). There {{was not a significant}} difference in asthma medication use behaviors between those having a WAAP or not and those with a WAAP on file at school or not. Conclusions. Children with not well-controlled or poorly controlled asthma <b>were</b> more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> ever <b>been</b> given a WAAP and <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a WAAP on file at school; this likelihood persisted after controlling for socio-economic factors and routine care visits...|$|R
