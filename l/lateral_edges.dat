5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the third week of development, the embryonic ectoderm forms a thickened strip called the neural plate. By the fourth week of development the neural plate has widened to give a broad cephalic end, a less broad middle part and a narrow caudal end. These swellings represent {{the beginning}}s of the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. Neural crest cells (derived from the ectoderm) populate the <b>lateral</b> <b>edges</b> of the plate at the neural folds. In the fourth week in the neurulation stage the neural plate folds and closes to form the neural tube, bringing together the neural crest cells at the neural crest. The neural crest runs the length of the tube with cranial neural crest cells at the cephalic end and caudal neural crest cells at the tail. Cells detach from the crest and migrate in a craniocaudal (head to tail) wave inside the tube. Cells at the cephalic end give rise to the brain, and cells at the caudal end give rise to the spinal cord.|$|E
5|$|The {{color pattern}} varies geographically. The head has two well-marked dark bands: {{one on the}} crown and the other between the eyes. On {{the sides of the}} head, there are two oblique dark bands or bars that run from the eye to the supralabials. Below, the head is {{yellowish}} white with scattered dark blotches. Iris color ranges from gold to silver-gray. Dorsally, the ground-color varies from straw yellow, to light brown, to orange or reddish brown. This is overlaid with a pattern of 18–22 backwardly-directed, dark brown to black bands that extend down the back and tail. Usually these bands are roughly chevron-shaped, but may be more U-shaped in some areas. They also form 2–6 light and dark cross-bands on the tail. Some populations are heavily flecked with brown and black, often obscuring other coloration, giving the animal a dusty-brown or blackish appearance. The belly is yellow or white, with a few scattered dark spots. Newborn young have golden head markings with pinkish to reddish ventral plates toward the <b>lateral</b> <b>edges.</b>|$|E
25|$|Raked wingtips, {{similar to}} the ones used on the 777-200LR, 777-300ER, and 787 aircraft, are used on the new 747 variant instead of {{winglets}} used on the 747-400. These wingtip structures help reduce the wingtip vortices at the <b>lateral</b> <b>edges</b> of the wings, decreasing wake turbulence and drag, and thereby improving fuel efficiency. Another effort to reduce weight is the introduction of fly-by-wire technology {{for the majority of the}} lateral controls.|$|E

25|$|A notable {{number of}} species have {{developed}} special glands that produce chemicals for deterring predators (see Defense and predation). The Ground beetle's (of Carabidae) defensive glands, located at the posterior, produce a variety of hydrocarbons, aldehydes, phenols, quinones, esters, and acids released from an opening {{at the end of}} the abdomen. While African carabid beetles (e.g., Anthia some of which used to comprise the genus Thermophilum) employ the same chemicals as ants: formic acid. While Bombardier beetles have well developed, like other carabid beetles, pygidial glands that empty from the <b>lateral</b> <b>edges</b> of the intersegment membranes between the seventh and eighth abdominal segments. The gland is made of two containing chambers. The first holds hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide, with the second holding just hydrogen peroxide plus catalases. These chemicals mix and result in an explosive ejection, forming temperatures of around 100 C, with the breakdown of hydroquinone to H2 + O2 + quinone, with the O2 propelling the excretion.|$|E

2500|$|The highly dynamic {{nature of}} growth cones {{allows them to}} respond to the {{surrounding}} environment by rapidly changing direction and branching in response to various stimuli. There are three stages of axon outgrowth, which are termed: protrusion, engorgement, and consolidation. [...] During protrusion, there is a rapid extension of filopodia and lamellar extensions along {{the leading edge of the}} growth cone. [...] Engorgement follows when the filopodia move to the <b>lateral</b> <b>edges</b> of the growth cone, and microtubules invade further into the growth cone, bringing vesicles and organelles such as mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. [...] Finally, consolidation occurs when the F-actin at the neck of the growth cone depolymerizes and the filopodia retract. [...] The membrane then shrinks to form a cylindrical axon shaft around the bundle of microtubules. [...] One form of axon branching also occurs via the same process, except that the growth cone “splits” during the engorgement phase. This results in the bifurcation of the main axon. An additional form of axon branching is termed collateral (or interstitial) branching;.Collateral branching, unlike axon bifurcations, involves the formation of a new branch from the established axon shaft and is independent of the growth cone at the tip of the growing axon. In this mechanism, the axon initially generates a filopodium or lamellipodium which following invasion by axonal microtubules can then develop further into a branch extending perpendicular from the axon shaft. Established collateral branches, like the main axon, exhibit a growth cone and develop independently of the main axon tip.|$|E

30|$|Using the motion-capture system, true {{real-time}} {{measurements of}} the displacement were recorded. Each of the corresponding digitized points, which are the seven pairs of digitizations representing a point on each the fracture fragment and the proximal humerus, were measured in 3 D space throughout the experiments. The distances were recorded using NDI First Principles software (Northern Digital Inc, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada). The two distances along the fracture line focused on {{in this study were}} the displacement at the <b>lateral</b> <b>edge</b> (proximal humerus <b>lateral</b> <b>edge</b> to fractured fragment <b>lateral</b> <b>edge)</b> and the posterior edge (proximal humerus posterior edge to fractured fragment posterior edge) (Fig.  4).

First cirrus, long, multiarticulate, having fourteen or fifteen segments, whilst the sixth cirrus had nineteen segments; rami unequal in length by about two segments; basal segments protuberant brush-like. Second and third cirri with five basal segments of both rami protuberant and brush-like; but the anterior rami in both cirri are broader than the posterior rami. Spines on the protuberant segments of both rami of both cirri, coarsely and doubly pectinated.|$|E

The {{segments}} of the three posterior pair are somewhat protuberant, bearing six pair of short, strong spines, graduated in length, between which there is a very thick, longitudinal brush of short, fine, straight bristles, of which the lower ones are the longest; some thick, minute spines arise from the upper <b>lateral</b> <b>edges</b> of the segments. The spines in the dorsal tufts are short, much crowded, and of nearly equal length; see figure, 27, Pl. X, in the allied P. polymerus. In a specimen in which the sixth cirrus had seventeen segments, the first cirrus had, in the shorter ramus, eight segments, of which the lower four were thick and protuberant, with the spines doubly serrated. In this same specimen, the anterior ramus of the second cirrus had twelve segments, of which the five basal ones were highly protuberant, and thickly clothed with non-serrated spines. In the third cirrus the basal segments of the anterior ramus are highly protuberant. The basal segments in the posterior rami of both these cirri, are slightly protuberant, but otherwise resemble the segments in the three posterior pair.|$|E
50|$|Crescents are {{a type of}} {{artifact}} {{or group}} of artifacts that are somewhat morphologically diverse, but typically consist of a chipped-stone tool that is bilaterally symmetrical, bifacially pressure flaked, may have winged edges, and typically have edge-grinding. Crescents are typically found as part of surface assemblages as opposed to well-dated subsurface contexts, and lack good chronology which would indicate if the degree of morphological variability represents changes over time, or if the differences represent regional expressions. Crescent morphology has been subdivided into three groups including lunate, winged, and eccentric crescents. Lunate crescents typically have a curved/convex proximal <b>lateral</b> <b>edge</b> with a generally straight to convex distal <b>lateral</b> <b>edge.</b> Winged crescents are characterized by convex proximal <b>lateral</b> <b>edge</b> and a concave distal <b>lateral</b> <b>edge.</b> Some eccentric crescents {{have been described as}} being shaped like animals such as bears, while others consist of serrated or barbed edges. The most common materials crescents are made of include chert, chalcedony, and jasper - all strong and durable lithic materials that are not as brittle as obsidian; however, although its rare, some crescents are made of obsidian.|$|R

30|$|Pelvis radiographs {{were used}} for {{calculation}} of the LCEA {{to the edge of}} the acetabulum and {{to the edge of the}} sourcil, and for the presence or absence of subluxation (Fig.  1). The center of the femoral head was first obtained using a best-fit circle. The center of both femoral heads was then connected as a reference for the horizontal axis. The <b>lateral</b> <b>edge</b> of the acetabulum was defined as the lateral most ossification. The <b>lateral</b> <b>edge</b> of the sourcil was defined as the most lateral end of the sclerotic subchondral bone. The LCEA was then calculated by a line perpendicular to the horizontal axis and a line from the femoral head center to the <b>lateral</b> <b>edge</b> of the sourcil for LCEA-S and to the <b>lateral</b> <b>edge</b> of the acetabulum for LCEA-E. Calculation of the LCEA-S and LCEA-E measurements were made by two independent fellowship trained, orthopedic surgeons with less than 5  years of clinical practice to determine inter- and intrarater reliability. The reviewers were blinded to the measurements of each other and to the identity of patients. All measurements were made on digital radiographs using Merge PACS measurement tools (version 6.5. 6; Merge Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA).|$|R

30|$|The LCEA (originally {{described}} by Wiberg {{as the center}} edge angle) is an important radiographic parameter in diagnosing hip dysplasia, as it represents superolateral coverage of the femoral head in the coronal plane on AP radiographs [3, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Undiagnosed or incompletely treated hip dysplasia can lead to serious consequences, including premature osteoarthritis [2, 3, 4]. While the sourcil more accurately represents the standard <b>lateral</b> <b>edge</b> of the weight-bearing acetabulum, it has been debated whether this angle should be measured to the <b>lateral</b> <b>edge</b> of the acetabulum or to the <b>lateral</b> <b>edge</b> of the sourcil [11, 12]. These two measurements {{have been shown to}} significantly differ from one another, especially in younger children, cases of acetabular retroversion, and low anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS), leading to errors in diagnosis [11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18]. In this study, we confirm that there is, on average, a 10 ° difference between these two measurements. In addition, we were able to show that the LCEA-S better correlates with the central weight-bearing portion of the articular surface on 3 D analysis and is, thus, a superior indicator of femoral head coverage in hip dysplasia.|$|R
