5|$|Heywood {{served as}} an {{intermediary}} linking western companies to powerful Chinese politicians. He was a long-time associate of the Bo family: he reportedly shared a close personal relationship with Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, and had helped the couple's son Bo Guagua earn admission to Harrow School in England. Heywood also allegedly served as a middleman for the family, helping them clandestinely move <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> of money overseas.|$|E
5|$|Honoré de Balzac {{was drawn}} to a {{diversity}} of interests throughout his life, from business to politics. After studying the law for three years, he wrote a number of potboiler novels under various pseudonyms. He also lost <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> of borrowed money in the publishing trade, attempting to capitalize on cheap editions of classical works. By 1828 he owed his mother 50,000 francs.|$|E

Neither was, however, indicted, and in fact they sued the Serious Fraud Office for wrongful arrest, receiving <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> in compensation.|$|E

5|$|The Abwehr {{was right}} {{to worry about the}} {{presence}} of British double agents within their secret service. They were at that time already running 'Garbo' (Juan Pujol), 'Zig-Zag' (Eddie Chapman) and 'Tricycle' (Dušan Popov), supposedly German agents to whom they were paying <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> of money, but who were in reality working for the British and were supplying the Germans with false information.|$|E
5|$|Although Athenian {{women were}} not legally {{permitted}} to dispose of <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> of money, they frequently had large dowries which supported them throughout their lives. Income from a dowry could be significant. The larger a woman's dowry relative to her husband's wealth, the more influence she was likely {{to have in the}} household since she retained the dowry if the couple divorced. Athenian women could also acquire property by inheritance if they were the closest surviving relative, but could not contractually acquire or dispose of property.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1730s public taste for Italian opera was {{beginning}} to fade. The popular success of John Gay and Johann Christoph Pepusch's The Beggar's Opera (first performed in 1728) had heralded a spate of English-language ballad-operas that mocked the pretensions of Italian opera. With box-office receipts falling, Handel's productions were increasingly reliant on private subsidies from the nobility. Such funding became harder to obtain after the launch in 1730 of the Opera of the Nobility, a rival company to his own. Handel overcame this challenge, but he spent <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> {{of his own money}} in doing so.|$|E

5|$|Edward II gave Wallingford Castle {{first to}} his royal favourite, Piers Gaveston, {{and then to}} his young wife, Isabella of France, with <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> still being spent on the property. Edward {{continued}} to use the castle as a royal prison for holding his enemies, until his own fall from power in 1326; Isabella, who overthrew her husband, then used it as an early headquarters following her invasion of England. Her son, Edward III, ultimately settled the castle on the new title of the Duke of Cornwall, used by sons of the king.|$|E
5|$|His horses raced at the Del Mar Racetrack, and he {{invested}} <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> {{of money}} in the hobby. Murphy had a gambling habit that left his finances in a poor state. In 1968 he stated that he lost $260,000 in an Algerian oil deal and was dealing with the Internal Revenue Service over unpaid taxes. In spite of his financial difficulties, Murphy refused to appear in commercials for alcohol and cigarettes, mindful of the influence he would have on the youth market.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} appease the people of Rome an {{estimated}} 135 million sestertii was spent on donatives, or congiaria, throughout Domitian's reign. The Emperor also revived the practice of public banquets, which {{had been reduced to}} a simple distribution of food under Nero, while he invested <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> on entertainment and games. In 86 he founded the Capitoline Games, a quadrennial contest comprising athletic displays, chariot racing, and competitions for oratory, music and acting.|$|E
60|$|He was guarded in his letter. He {{mentioned}} no definite figures. He {{wrote that}} Ira Nutcombe of {{whom they had}} spoken so often had most surprisingly left him in his will a <b>large</b> <b>sum</b> of money, and eased his conscience by telling himself that half of a million pounds undeniably was a <b>large</b> <b>sum</b> of money.|$|R
50|$|According to Houbraken he was {{a student}} of Philips Wouwerman and Adriaen van de Velde. His birthdate is uncertain, but he was judged to be about forty when he died of tuberculosis. Houbraken thought he caught the disease from melancholy {{resulting}} from losing a <b>large</b> <b>sum</b> of money (said to be 4,000 Dutch florins, a very <b>large</b> <b>sum</b> for a painter to have), which depressed him. He always suspected his landlord, who rented him the room he had been staying in when it happened. It is unclear how he came into the possession of such a <b>large</b> <b>sum</b> of money, whether by selling paintings or by inheritance.|$|R

5|$|Members of {{the band}} had been offered <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> of money to reunite for concerts and tours, and had turned the offers down. Rumors of tension between de la Rocha and the other former band members {{subsequently}} circulated, but Commerford {{said that he and}} de la Rocha saw each other often and went surfing together, while Morello said he and de la Rocha communicated by phone, and had met up at a September 15, 2005 protest in support of the South Central Farm.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{was not a}} {{religious}} man; he viewed the papacy {{as a means to}} consolidate his family's position. He appointed Alessandro as cardinal against accusations of nepotism, fathered a number of illegitimate children, and spent <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> of church money collecting art and antiquities. Around 1545 Charles took the political and military advantage, weakening Paul's hold on the papacy. Aware of the changing tides of influence, Titian abandoned the commission before completion, and for the next 100 years the painting languished unframed in a Farnese cellar.|$|E
5|$|Rockefeller {{would support}} Baptist missionary activity, fund universities, and heavily engage in {{religious}} activities at his Cleveland, Ohio church. While traveling the South, he would donate <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> {{of money to}} churches belonging to the Southern Baptist Convention, various Black churches, {{as well as other}} Christian denominations. One time, he paid for a slave's freedom and donated to a Roman Catholic orphanage. As he grew rich, his donations became more generous, especially to his church in Cleveland; nevertheless, it was demolished in 1925, and replaced with another building.|$|E

5|$|Shackleton {{expected}} to make <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> from his book about the expedition and from lectures. He also hoped to profit from sales of special postage stamps bearing the cancellation stamp of the Antarctica post office that Shackleton, appointed temporary postmaster by the New Zealand government, intended to establish there. None of these schemes produced the anticipated riches, although the post office was set up at Cape Royds and used as a conduit for the expedition's mail.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} tactic used by Palestinians during the Intifada was {{throwing}} stones, molotov cocktails, and burning tires. The local leadership in some West Bank towns commenced non-violent protests against Israeli occupation {{by engaging in}} tax resistance and other boycotts. Israel responded by confiscating <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> of money in house-to-house raids. As the Intifada came to a close, new armed Palestinian groups—in particular Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)—began targeting Israeli civilians with the new tactic of suicide bombings, and internal fighting amongst the Palestinians increased dramatically.|$|E
5|$|The {{value to}} the sinecurist of an office like that of Paymaster of Marines lay {{not so much in}} the {{official}} salary attached to it, but in the lax accounting procedures associated with disbursement of funds, which allowed the official to retain <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> of public money in his own hands for many years until accounts were made up. The office of Paymaster General had been reformed in 1783 to avoid these abuses, but these changes had not yet been extended to the Marines during Villiers' tenure.|$|E

5|$|While Murray {{prepared}} Emma for publication, Austen began The Elliots, later {{published as}} Persuasion. She completed her first draft in July 1816. In addition, {{shortly after the}} publication of Emma, Henry Austen repurchased the copyright for Susan from Crosby. Austen was forced to postpone publishing either of these completed novels by family financial troubles. Henry Austen's bank failed in March 1816, depriving him of all of his assets, leaving him deeply in debt and losing Edward, James, and Frank Austen <b>large</b> <b>sums.</b> Henry and Frank could no longer afford the contributions they had made to support their mother and sisters.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} brands ran {{commercials}} {{tied to the}} 2012 apocalypse in the months and days leading to the date. In February 2012, American automotive company General Motors aired an advertisement during the annual Super Bowl football game in which {{a group of friends}} drove Chevrolet Silverados through the ruins of human civilization following the 2012 apocalypse, while on 17 December 2012, Jell-O ran an ad saying that offering Jell-O to the Mayan gods would appease them into sparing the world. John Verret, Professor of Advertising at Boston University, questioned the utility of tying <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> of money to such a unique and short-term event.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving his}} first wife, Elizabeth, he married {{for the second}} time, on 20 September 1858, to Adeline de Horsey, {{achieving}} still greater notoriety {{as he had been}} conducting an affair with her as his wife was dying. This, however, was a happy union, notwithstanding the disparity in their ages and Cardigan's disappointment that there were, again, no children. Adeline, excluded from fashionable society {{for the rest of her}} days, accustomed herself to life in the country, happily forsaking her previous interests of books, painting and music, while Brudenell spent <b>large</b> <b>sums</b> of money making their home together comfortable. Adeline even remained on good terms with Brudenell's principal mistress, Maria Marchioness of Ailesbury, and tolerated his other affairs.|$|E
