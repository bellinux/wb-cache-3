40|$|In this paper, a novel {{portable}} hard-disk encryption/decryption {{system with}} a MEMS <b>coded</b> <b>lock</b> is presented, which can authenticate the user and provide the key for the AES encryption/decryption module. The portable hard-disk encryption/decryption system is composed of the authentication module, the USB portable hard-disk interface card, the ATA protocol command decoder module, the data encryption/decryption module, the cipher key management module, the MEMS <b>coded</b> <b>lock</b> controlling circuit module, the MEMS <b>coded</b> <b>lock</b> and the hard disk. The ATA protocol circuit, the MEMS control circuit and AES encryption/decryption circuit are designed and realized by FPGA(Field Programmable Gate Array). The MEMS <b>coded</b> <b>lock</b> with two couplers and two groups of counter-meshing-gears (CMGs) are fabricated by a LIGA-like process and precision engineering method. The whole prototype was fabricated and tested. The test {{results show that the}} user’s password could be correctly discriminated by the MEMS <b>coded</b> <b>lock,</b> and the AES encryption module could get the key from the MEMS <b>coded</b> <b>lock.</b> Moreover, the data in the hard-disk could be encrypted or decrypted, and the read-write speed of the dataflow could reach 17 MB/s in Ultra DMA mode...|$|R

A therapist, Lisa, consoles Kyle, who starts doubting her own sanity until she notices the heart Julia {{drew on the}} foggy window next to her seat. Kyle asks {{to use the bathroom}} and, once inside, climbs through a trapdoor into the plane's overhead crawl space. She sabotages the aircraft's electronics, deploying the oxygen masks and cutting power to the plane's lighting. During the ensuing chaos, she rides a dumbwaiter to the lower freight deck.

50|$|Mutual {{exclusion}} has a Lock convoy problem, {{in which}} threads may pile up on a lock, causing the JVM {{to need to}} maintain expensive queues of waiters and to 'park' the waiting threads. It is expensive to park and unpark a thread, and a slow context switch may occur. Context switches require from microseconds to milliseconds, while the Map's own basic operations normally take nanoseconds. Performance can drop to {{a small fraction of}} a single Threads' throughput as contention increases. When there is no or little contention for the lock, there is little performance impact, however, except for the lock's contention test. Modern JVMs will inline most of the <b>lock</b> <b>code,</b> reducing it to only a few instructions, keeping the no-contention case very fast. Reentrant techniques like native synchronization or java.util.concurrent.ReentrantReadWriteLock however have extra performance-reducing baggage in the maintenance of the reentrancy depth, affecting the no-contention case as well. The Convoy problem seems to be easing with modern JVMS, but it can be hidden by slow context switching: in this case, latency will increase, but throughput will continue to be acceptable. With hundreds of threads, a context switch time of 10ms produces a latency in seconds.|$|E

Avout from the Ringing Vale, who dedicate their lives to study of the martial arts and military tactics, head off to destroy the ship's main weapon, ultimately successful, but also perishing in their attack. The narrative now parallelizes (across multiple variations of the multiple cosmos of Arbre) as the avout team boards the ship and pass out from breathing the alien oxygen. In one Narrative, Fraa Jad awakens Erasmas and leads him through the ship toward the command center.

40|$|New {{development}} in wireless technology using multiple antennas with appropriate space-time processing has recently {{become the new}} frontier of wireless communication systems due to the potential for providing very high spectral efficiency and enormous capacity improvement over the conventional wireless radio communications. The technical advances in using the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless links present a promising breakthrough in resolving the bottleneck of current capacity limitation for future intensive wireless networks. The MIMO wireless systems utilize multiple antennas at both side of the transmitter and the receiver for enormous gains in spectral efficiency as well as system capacity in terms of higher data throughput by exploiting the multipath diversity in a rich scattering environment. A number of MIMO systems have been proposed to permit very high transmission rate, far exceeding the conventional communication technique. In particular, the Bell Laboratories layered space-time (BLAST) architecture has been presented that uses concept of spatial diversity and successive interference cancellation technique {{to improve the quality}} of signal reception over the flat-fading or the frequency selective fading channel. However, in order to achieve the quoted capacity gains in MIMO systems, the channeli nformation in terms of the multiple channeli mpulse responses(C IRs) and their fading coefficients must be known or estimated, which requires the design of a suitable channele stimator. T hus far, existing MIMO channele stimations chemesh aveb eenm ostly limited to the flat-fading case or cater specifically for coded space-time systems such as space-timeb <b>lock</b> <b>code</b> systems. I n this thesis,t he work is to considert he existing MIMO channel estimation techniques (used in the flat fading condition) and extend them to cater for a more realistic time-varying, frequency selective fading channel. The focus of this thesis has been the design and development of suitable training-based MIMO channel estimation scheme as well as the formulation of a new pilot code to enable effective estimation for the frequency selective channel. The novel channel estimator is also incorporatedi nto the BLAST architecturet o allow the practical assessmenotf using nonidealized channel to be studied and analysed for the performance of the MIMO systems. The driver for this work has been the recognition of the importance of channel knowledge for all the MIMO system to be used in practical application.

40|$|Abstract. Read-write locks {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} lock forms in concur-rent applications because they allow read accesses to <b>locked</b> <b>code</b> to proceed in parallel. However, they do not offer any parallelism between reads and writes. This paper introduces pessimistic lock-elision (PLE), a new approach for non-speculatively replacing read-write locks with pessimistic (i. e. non-aborting) soft-ware transactional code that allows read-write concurrency even for contended code and even if the code includes system calls. On systems with hardware trans-actional support, PLE will allow failed transactions, or ones that contain system calls, to preserve read-write concurrency. Our PLE algorithm is based on a novel encounter-order design of a fully pes-simistic STM system that in a variety of benchmarks spanning from counters to trees, even when up to 40 % of calls are mutating the locked structure, provides up to 5 times the performance of a state-of-the-art read-write lock...|$|R
