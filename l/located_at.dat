40|$|It is {{a general}} {{agreement}} that hemodynamics plays very {{important role in the}} initiation, growth, and rupture of cerebral aneurysms and hemodynamics in the anterior communicating artery aneurysms is considered the most complex in all cerebral aneurysms {{and it is difficult to}} find some reasonable relationship between the hemodynamics parameters and the rupture risk. In this paper, the 3 D geometries of four anterior communicating artery aneurysms were generated from the CTA data and the computational models with bilateral feeding arteries for the four aneurysms were constructed. The blood flow was simulated by computational fluid dynamics software and the hemodynamics parameters such as velocity, wall shear stress, and oscillatory shear index were calculated. The following results were observed: one of the four models only needs the left feeding artery; the max normalized wall shear stress <b>locates</b> <b>at</b> the aneurysmal neck of the largest aneurysm; the max oscillatory shear index <b>locates</b> <b>at</b> the aneurysmal sac of the largest aneurysm. The conclusion was drawn that the anterior communicating artery aneurysm has higher rupture risk from the hemodynamics viewpoint if the max wall shear stress <b>locates</b> <b>at</b> the neck and the max oscillatory shear index <b>locates</b> <b>at</b> the dome...|$|R
