This approach secures one end of the stud with a permanently attached acorn nut; the other end is secured by double nylon-insert nuts and washers which allow the entire assembly to spin freely if wheel removal is attempted.

50|$|Lochangel is a {{chestnut}} mare {{with a white}} {{star and}} two white socks bred by her owner, Jeff Smith's Littleton Stud.

Night Shift sired many other good racehorses in a <b>long</b> <b>stud</b> career, including In The Groove, Azamour, Well Chief, Barons Pit (Diadem Stakes) and Nicolotte (Queen Anne Stakes). Lochangel's dam Peckitt's Well was a useful racemare who won five races over sprint distances and was rated 98 by Timeform in 1985. As a broodmare she made an immediate impact with her first foal Lochsong who was twice champion sprinter in Europe and was voted Cartier Horse of the Year in 1993. Peckitt's Well was a distant descendant of the broodmare Fair Terms, the female-line ancestor of several major Japanese winners including Narita Brian.|$|E

50|$|Owing {{to their}} high {{compression}} ratios and their high bmep, diesel engines place a high tensile stress on their cylinder block. Light alloy cylinder blocks have their usual weight advantages, but these must also withstand the high forces. Some designs, {{such as the}} US Hercules, achieve this by using long through bolts. In the Hercules design these are <b>long</b> <b>studs</b> with a nut at both top and bottom; they are prevented from rotating by an eccentric collar in the middle.|$|R
50|$|The Jedwart stave (called the Jeddart or Jedburgh stave) was a polearm weapon {{commonly}} found in the Scottish Borders in the 16th century. It consisted of a large, thin, double-edged axe-like blade attached to a roughly four-foot <b>long</b> <b>studded</b> stave with a hand guard, similar in appearance to a bardiche. The upheaval {{of the sixteenth century}} in the borders proved the weapon to be too light to be effective against the heavy cavalry of the Border Reivers and attacks from the English, and it fell out of favour in combat. It remained however a common household weapon for purpose of self-defence.|$|R
50|$|Ranunculus hebecarpus is {{a species}} of {{buttercup}} known by the common name delicate buttercup. It is native to western North America, including several of the western United States and Baja California, where it grows in grassland, woodland, and chaparral habitat. It is an annual herb producing a slender, hairy stem a few centimeters high or up to 30 centimeters tall. The hairy leaves are borne on long petioles. Their blades are deeply lobed or divided into three leaflets, often with toothed or lobed edges. Flowers have 3 to 5 tiny yellow petals just 1 or 2 millimeters <b>long</b> <b>studded</b> on the bulbous nectary; some flowers lack petals. The plant is most easily identified in its fruiting stage, when the infructescence is a spherical cluster of several tiny disc-shaped achenes with compressed, bristly sides.|$|R

50|$|The long-bolt design {{began with}} {{aircraft}} engines, {{particularly those that}} combined high power and lightweight construction of aluminium alloy. These early engines used <b>long</b> <b>studs</b> from the crankcase to the cylinder heads. As most at this time used monobloc heads only one bolt would anyway be needed to join the two pieces, but a long fastener the full height of the cylinder was used so as to place the tension forces into the stud, rather than stressing and possibly distorting the cylinder walls. Curtiss and air-cooled Renault engines even used an X-shaped cap above {{the outside of the}} cylinder head, with the studs bolted though that so as to distribute the forces evenly across the head. As forces were still transmitted between these studs and the main bearings by the walls of the crankcase, these early engines are not however considered as long-bolt engines.|$|R

50|$|The city of Seringapatam {{occupied}} {{an island}} in the Kaveri River, which at that point flowed roughly west-to-east from the Western Ghats {{on its way to the}} Bay of Bengal. The city proper occupied the center of the island, with the western end of the island occupied by a strong stone fortress, and the eastern end by a large walled garden that included Tipu's palace and the tomb of his father, Hyder Ali. Tipu had arrayed army, which Cornwallis estimated to number between forty and fifty thousand, along a roughly semicircular line on the northern shore of the Kaveri that covered the approaches to the island. This line, three to four miles (four to five km) <b>long,</b> was <b>studded</b> with six redoubts, and much of the line was protected by a thick hedge.

40|$|In steel-concrete {{composite}} beams, stud shear connectors {{are commonly}} used to transfer the longitudinal shear force across the steel flange/concrete slab interface. In some structures, however, headed studs could be subjected to huge tensile loading during life-span of structures. In this paper, the pull-out behaviour of stud shear connector is studied using both experimental and numerical methods. In experimental study, a standard pull-out test procedure was proposed and twelve full-scale specimens were manufactured and tested to determine pull-out load-displacement curves. Depending on the stud heights, all specimens were divided into four groups with 3 specimens in each group. In each group, two specimens were carried out under a monotonic loading and one was conducted subjected to a repeated loading pattern. Two kinds of failure mode, concrete cone failure and stud shank failure, were observed in these tests. The resulting monotonic load-displacement mechanism is studied as a 3 D problem using finite element analysis software, DIANA. The FEA results are found in good agreement with the test results. All experimental and FEA results demonstrate that specimens with <b>long</b> headed <b>studs</b> have good performances of ultimate strength and ductility...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss the}} direct {{measurement}} of the trilinear vector boson couplings in present and future collider experiments. The major goals of such experiments will be the confirmation of the Standard Model (SM) predictions {{and the search for}} signals of new physics. We review our current theoretical understanding of anomalous trilinear gauge boson self-interactions. If the energy scale of the new physics is ∼ 1 TeV, these low energy anomalous couplings are expected to be no larger than O(10 ^- 2). Constraints from high precision measurements at LEP and low energy charged and neutral current processes are critically reviewed.

40|$|Despite intense {{diplomatic}} activity between Vietnam and her Southeast Asian {{neighbors to}} reach a compromise in their conflict resulting from the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea, the Hanoi government shows every indication of seeking to secure a permanent military and political presence in Kampuchea. Also because of the devastation brought by four years of the Pol Pot regime (1975 - 79), and the extermination {{of much of the}} skilled and educated social strata in Kampuchea, the Hanoi government has sent some 40, 000 Vietnamese party cadres, civil officials and professionally trained to direct public affairs. Additionally, some 100, 000 Vietnamese farmer s have migrated into Kampuchea, settling in such key provinces as Kompong Speu, Takeo, and Kompong Cham. Additional tens of thousands of Vietnamese settlers have moved into cities and the disputed frontier area. As fighting between the Vietnamese and resistance groups affiliated with the ''Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea" intensifies, the Hanoi regime also has been expanding its logistical-military network. This includes {{the construction of a new}} road network — popularly called the "New Ho CM Minh Trail" — linking the Vietnamese cities of Hue and Vinh, across Southern Laos, with Northwestern Kampuchea. Additionally, during the early weeks of 1983, a twenty-five kilometres <b>long</b> trench, <b>studded</b> with landmines and bamboo spikes has been constructed just inside the Kampuchean frontier, running from the village of Kop beyond the village of Yeang Dangkum — a region of frequent guerilla clashes.
