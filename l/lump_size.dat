Stage one rhabdomyosarcoma is seen in the eye and area surrounding it, the gallbladder, connecting bile ducts, and male and female genitalia.

50|$|In powder two {{different}} dimensions in the mixing {{process can be}} determined: convective mixing and intensive mixing. In the case of convective mixing material in the mixer is transported from one location to another. This type of mixing leads to a less ordered state inside the mixer, the components that must be mixed are distributed over the other components. With progressing time the mixture becomes more randomly ordered. After a certain mixing time the ultimate random state is reached. Usually this type of mixing is applied for free-flowing and coarse materials. Possible threat during macro mixing is the de-mixing of the components, since differences in size, shape or density of the different particles can lead to segregation. In the convective mixing range, Hosokawa has several processes available from silo mixers to horizontal mixers and conical mixers.When materials are cohesive, which {{is the case with}} e.g. fine particles and also with wet material, convective mixing is no longer sufficient to obtain a randomly ordered mixture. The relative strong inter-particle forces form lumps, which are not broken up by the mild transportation forces in the convective mixer. To decrease the <b>lump</b> <b>size</b> additional forces are necessary; i.e. more energy intensive mixing is required. These additional forces can either be impact forces or shear forces.|$|E

40|$|The {{degradation}} {{characteristics of}} various ores and coal types due to particle breakage {{have been studied}} {{by a number of}} researchers to determine the causes of degradation and its prevention during the handling process from mines to end users. They have used several drop tests to determine the degradation characteristics of each ore and coal such as: critical drop height tests; cushioning tests; different types of impact surface tests; different sample sizes tests; stabilization tests; weathering tests and volume breakage index tests. Researchers have also used a tumbler drum test to measure the attrition or abrasion properties of the material during handling. This review highlights that the fines generation increases during transport from mines to end users due to more large vertical drops, replacing the larger vertical drops with smaller drop heights reduces the fines generation, the cushioning effects with initial fines reduce the degradation of <b>lump</b> <b>size</b> ore during handling, the different impact surfaces have different degradation characteristics, the stabilized ore produced less percentage of fines than the normal ore during handling and the rate of fines generation of coal increases with the period of weathering. The rate of degradation is higher in larger <b>lump</b> <b>size</b> coal compared to smaller <b>lump</b> <b>size.</b> The lump coal dropped from lower heights does not follow a first order breakage process behavior.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this project is to {{investigate}} different tool steels {{in terms of their}} ability to withstand material transfer buildup, so-called galling, occurring in SMF (sheet metal forming) operations. The ability to withstand galling is vital to optimize cost-effectiveness and increase the work tool’s effective operational time. This investigation studies four different tool steels, including a TiN-coating, with the intention of evaluating the microstructures, chemical composition and hardness effect on galling resistance in dry conditions using a slider-on-flatsurface (SOFS) tribo-tester which measures the coefficient of friction during sliding. An OP (optical profilometer) was used to measure the size and geometry of lump growth on the tool and damage on the work sheet. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to identify the interacting tribological mechanisms exhibited at different stages during the slide. The SEM figures confirmed three different types of characteristic patterns exhibited in the tracks after tribo- testing which were categorized as mild adhesive, abrasive and severe adhesive damage. A SEM figure that illustrates a ragged contact surface and an obvious change in the sheet materials plastic behavior is in this report regarded as a sign of severe adhesive contact, the characteristics could possibly be explained by local high temperature and high pressure followed by a sudden pressure drop and creation of hardened welds or solders between the two surfaces which increase the frictional input needed for further advancement. Friction coefficients observed in the initial 100 % mild adhesive stage were, μ= 0, 22 - 0, 26 succeeded by abrasive SEM characteristics often in association with mild adhesive contact and friction values between μ= 0, 25 - 0, 4 which where sometimes followed by severe adhesive SEM characteristics in 100 % of the contact zone with friction values between μ= 0, 34 - 0, 9 respectively. The tool material that performed best according to the friction detection criteria was Sv 21 closely followed by Sleipner (TiN coated) and Va 40 (HRC 63. 3). Unfortunately was the friction criteria, a significant raise in friction for defining a sliding length to galling, not adequate for dry conditions due to immediate material transfer succeeded by cyclic changes between partial or 100 % abrasive+mild adhesive and severe adhesive contact. The mechanism that change abrasive wear in association with mild adhesive contact, (moderate friction input), to sever adhesive wear, (higher friction input), is dependent on lump shape (lump geometry) and can appear at comparably low speeds 0, 04 - 0, 08 [m/s] and low friction energy input (μ= 0, 34), the magnitude of the change in friction is therefore not always significant and hardly detectable on the friction graph. This was quite unexpected but could be explained by concentration of friction energy rater than the absolute amount. The problem with using friction graphs for galling evaluation was increased even further when a very small <b>lump</b> <b>size</b> and low corresponding rate of material transfer to the tool surface caused a sustainable high raise in friction (μ≈ 0, 3 → 0, 6) on a TiN-coated tool steel called Sleipner. A hardly detectable or similar friction raise for Sv 21 and Va 40 showed much larger corresponding <b>lump</b> <b>size</b> and rate of material transfer. This means that friction graphs demonstrate a clear problem with quantifying <b>lump</b> <b>size</b> [m 3] and rate of  material transfer [m 3 /s]. Another phenomenon called stick slip behavior, material transfer and lump growth followed by a sudden decrease in <b>lump</b> <b>size</b> and transfer of material back to the work sheet, is also not possible to detect on a friction graph. Because a drop in friction can easily be a change in contact temperature and lump attack angle due to a growing lump and not a decreasing lump.   The conclusion, a friction graph is not suited for galling evaluation and ranking in dry SOFS conditions. A ranking should primarily be based on dimensional OP measurements of the cross section of formed tracks and scratches or preferably by repeated OP measurements of the tool surface during a single test, the last revel the exact lump growth history and true lump growth even in the sliding direction.  civilingenjörsexame...|$|E

Since the compilation of Frail & Weisberg, there are 35 pulsars with new distance estimate and 25 pulsars for which the distance or distance uncertainty have been revised. We used this data to fit a smooth, axisymmetric, two disk model {{of the distribution of}} galactic electrons. The two exponential model components have mean local midplane densities at the solar circle of 2. 03 e- 2 cm^- 3 and 0. 71 e- 2 cm^- 3, and scale heights of 1. 07 and 0. 053 kpc. The thick component shows very little radial variation, while the second has a radial scale length of only a few kiloparsecs. We also examined a model which varies as sech^ 2 (x), rather than exp(-x), in both the radial and vertical direction. We prefer this model with no midplane cusp, but find that the fit parameters essentially describe the same electron distribution. The distances predicted by this distribution have a similar scatter as the more complex model of Taylor & Cordes. We examine the pulsars that deviate strongly from this model. There are two regions of enhanced dispersion measure, one of which correlates well with the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm. We find that the scatter of the observed dispersion measure from the model is not fit well by either a normal or log-normal distribution of <b>lump</b> <b>sizes,</b> but may be caused instead by the uncertainties in the distances.
