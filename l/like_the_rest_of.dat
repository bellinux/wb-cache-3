5|$|Both ships served {{during the}} Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, where they {{operated}} against Russian {{forces in the}} Black Sea. They were primarily tasked with supporting Ottoman forces ashore, though Muin-i Zafer also helped to defend the port of Sulina. After the war, both vessels were placed in reserve, and saw no further activity until 1897, when they were mobilized {{at the start of}} the Greco-Turkish War. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the Ottoman fleet, both ships were in poor condition and were unable to be used offensively.|$|E
5|$|Both vessels saw action {{during the}} Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, where Lüft-ü Celil was sunk by a Russian {{artillery}} battery on the Danube. Hifz-ur Rahman engaged Russian minelayers {{at the mouth}} of the Danube but otherwise saw little action. She survived the war and was laid up for the following twenty years. She was mobilized at the outbreak of the Greco-Turkish War in 1897, but <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the Ottoman fleet, was in poor condition. The ship was eventually sold in 1909 and broken up.|$|E
5|$|Darlington's {{promotion}} campaign was dealt a blow in February 2009, when club chairman George Houghton placed {{the club in}} administration. As a result, the club were deducted 10points, a penalty from which they could not recover finally finishing 12th. Burgmeier finished with two goals during the season having played 35games, but <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the playing squad, was told he could find a new club by Darlington's administrators.|$|E

As a result, the fleet was kept safely behind the Dardanelles forts and it saw no action. The ship remained in service for another decade until she was decommissioned in 1909; she was sold in November that year to ship breakers and thereafter dismantled.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Toronto City Council again {{proposed}} {{to extend the}} line northeastward {{as a replacement for}} the aging Scarborough RT.

This chamber was located under the tip of the pyramid and is oriented on an east–west axis <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the queen's pyramid complex. It has a pented roof made of large limestone blocks, a construction technique common to all pyramid chambers of the 5th dynasty.

5|$|Carmelo Camet {{was born}} on October 29, 1904, the son of Francisco Carmelo Camet, a fencer at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, and Clara Isa. The elder Camet, though officially an athlete from France, is {{considered}} {{by some to be}} Argentina's first Olympic participant. This is disputed, however, by those who claim that Horatio Torromé should hold this title as the first official Argentine representative. Carmelo had one brother, Carlos Ernesto Camet, who pursued a political career.

5|$|Crawley {{lies within}} the Sussex Weald, {{an area of}} highly {{variable}} terrain, so that many microclimates of frost hollows, sun traps and windswept hilltops will be encountered over a short distance. During calm, clear periods of weather this allows for some interesting temperature variations, {{although most of the}} time, when mobile westerly airstreams persist, the weather is typically Oceanic <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the British Isles. Gatwick is the nearest weather station that publishes long-term averages that give an accurate description of the climate of the Crawley area, although more recently the Met Office has also published data for its nearby weather station at Charlwood. Both weather stations are about 3 miles north of Crawley town centre and at similar altitudes.|$|E
5|$|Daniels and Schur {{first started}} writing the script {{in the summer}} of 2008, when they were {{in the early stages of}} conceiving the series. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the series, the pilot was filmed in the same mockumentary style as The Office, the NBC comedy series also {{directed}} by Daniels. About one month before the pilot aired, a focus group report discussing several perceived problems with the episode was leaked to the media, which led to speculation that Parks and Recreation was not ready for prime-time television. The pilot episode featured a number of cultural references to such people as Bob Knight, Larry Bird and Laura Linney, as well as female political figures to whom Leslie compares herself, such as Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin, and Nancy Pelosi.|$|E

During his administration, spending and taxes were cut drastically {{in response to the}} Depression. The state government was completely reorganized. McNutt also enacted the state's first income tax. On several occasions, he declared martial law {{to put an end to}} worker strikes.|$|E
