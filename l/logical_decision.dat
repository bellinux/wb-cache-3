5|$|Montgomery's orders raised several issues, {{the first}} with the {{transport}} aircraft of the Troop Carrier Wings assigned to the airborne operations. When they had arrived in North Africa, it had been decided that the 52nd Troop Carrier Wing would operate with 1st Airborne Division and its counterpart, the 51st, with 82nd Airborne Division. A few weeks later this arrangement was switched, with the 52nd now operating with 82nd Airborne Division and the 51st with 1st Airborne Division; this seemed a <b>logical</b> <b>decision,</b> as each Wing had operational experience with the division it had been paired with. However, the decision to turn the Syracuse assault into a glider-based one was problematic; the 51st had practically no glider experience, whilst the 52nd had much more but was already training for a parachute-based mission. To switch both was impractical and would {{have led to a}} number of problems, which left 1st Airborne Division, and thus 1st Airlanding Brigade, with an inexperienced Troop Carrier Wing.|$|E

40|$|Many testing {{coverage}} criteria, including decision {{coverage and}} condition coverage, are well-known to be inadequate for software characterised by complex <b>logical</b> <b>decisions,</b> {{such as those}} in safety-critical software. In the past decade, more sophisticated testing criteria have been advocated. In particular, compliance of MC/DC has been mandated in the aviation industry for the approval of airborne software. On the other hand, the MUMCUT criterion has been proved to guarantee the detection of certain faults in <b>logical</b> <b>decisions</b> in irredundant disjunctive normal form. We analyse and empirically evaluate the ability of test sets satisfying these testing criteria in detecting faults in <b>logical</b> <b>decisions.</b> Our results show that MC/DC test sets are effective, but they may still miss some faults that can almost always be detected by test sets satisfying the MUMCUT criterion...|$|R

40|$|Fault based testing aims at {{detecting}} hypothesized faults {{based on}} specifications or program source. There are some fault based techniques for testing Boolean expressions which {{are commonly used}} to model conditions in specifications as well as <b>logical</b> <b>decisions</b> in program source. The MUMCUT strategy has been proposed to generate test cases from Boolean expressions. Moreover, it detects eight common types of hypothesized faults provided that the original expression is in irredundant disjunctive normal form, IDNF. Software practitioners {{are more likely to}} write the conditions and <b>logical</b> <b>decisions</b> in general form rather than IDNF. Hence, it is interesting to investigate the fault detecting capability of the MUMCUT strategy with respect to general form Boolean expressions. In this article, we perform empirical studies to investigate the fault detection capability of the MUMCUT strategy with respect to general form Boolean expressions as well as mutated expressions. A mutated expression can be obtained from the original given Boolean expression by making a syntactic change based on a particular type of fault...|$|R
5000|$|On 30 June 2012, at a {{press conference}} a day before the UEFA Euro 2012 Final, UEFA President Michel Platini {{suggested}} that instead of having one host country (or joint hosting by multiple countries), Euro 2020 may be spread over [...] "12 or 13 cities" [...] across the continent. A similar system is in use for its male and female under-age competitions. On 6 December 2012, UEFA announced that the 2020 championships would be held in multiple cities all over Europe to mark 60 years of the tournament's existence. Platini reasoned that this was the <b>logical</b> <b>decision</b> at a time of financial difficulty across Europe.|$|E
50|$|The {{value is}} created through the valuers {{attitude}} or judgements. Moral judgement and decisions {{is a crucial}} part in this value.

If something has intrinsic value it has properties or features in virtue {{of which it is}} valuable, separated of anyone's attitudes or judgements. It includes other variables such as brand name, trademarks, and copyrights that are usually difficult to calculate and sometimes not accurately reflected in the market price. Intrinsic value is not what the investors are willing to pay, however, it is what the object is really worth.|$|E
5000|$|On 1 November 1911, {{the long}} {{trek to the}} South Pole began. Scott had not {{originally}} planned to include [...] "Birdie" [...] Bowers in his polar party.

But on 4 January 1912, when Evans turned back, Bowers was assigned to the polar party. Some have argued that this seems to have been an impulsive decision by Scott. However, others, such as Antarctic explorer Ranulph Fiennes, have indicated that this was a <b>logical</b> <b>decision</b> - particularly when one intended to increase the speed of a polar land-crossing (in an effort to reduce the consumption of resources).|$|E

50|$|An ongoing {{downturn}} in certain {{sectors of the}} merchant marine industry which began in 2013 and that {{was caused by a}} multitude of factors such as weak global GDP, sluggish trade, vessel overcapacity, bloated retail inventories in the United States, and reduced demand for container shipping, eroded ocean-going cargo carriers' profits and triggered a wave of mergers and acquisitions. The overlapping businesses of both COSCO and China Shipping naturally fostered degrading competition between the two groups, and with the effect created by unfavorable market conditions, both companies were left financially anemic. Thus, it was a <b>logical</b> <b>decision</b> for the two groups to consolidate and endure the downturn as a unified entity. Furthermore, the Chinese Governments' reorganization of the obsolete structural format of its state-owned enterprise system is also attributable to this and other Chinese mergers.|$|E
50|$|Parents {{and other}} {{citizens}} brought {{a lawsuit against}} the school board, alleging that the school system was teaching the tenets of secular humanism, an anti-theistic religion.

After an initial ruling in a federal district court in favor of the plaintiffs, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled {{that as long as the}} school was motivated by a secular purpose, it didn't matter whether the curriculum and texts shared ideas held by one or more religious groups. The Court found that the texts in question promoted important secular values (tolerance, self-respect, <b>logical</b> <b>decision</b> making) and thus the use of the textbooks neither unconstitutionally advanced a nontheistic religion nor inhibited theistic religions.|$|E
