25|$|The Tyne Bridge's towers {{were built}} of Cornish granite and were {{designed}} by local architect Robert Burns Dick as warehouses with five storeys. But, the inner floors of the warehouses in the bridge's towers were not completed and, as a result, the storage areas were never used. <b>Lifts</b> <b>for</b> <b>passengers</b> and goods {{were built in the}} towers to provide access to the Quayside; they are no longer in use.|$|R
5000|$|Under {{the terms}} of the joint venture, final {{assembly}} of the buses would be done in Crown Coach facilities in Los Angeles. In addition to finishing the vehicles to American standards, the final assembly in California involved most of the interior work, allowing customization of the buses to the needs of each end-user. Alongside various specifications for seating design, this allowed for the inclusion of features such as wheelchair <b>lifts</b> <b>for</b> <b>passengers</b> with disabilities.|$|R
2500|$|The {{entrance}} shafts were {{fitted with}} steam-powered <b>lifts</b> <b>for</b> <b>passengers.</b> The tunnel was laid with [...] gauge railway track {{and a single}} car, carrying a maximum of 12 passengers, cable-hauled by two [...] stationary steam engines, {{one on each side}} of the river. The underground railway opened on 2 August 1870 charging 2d for first class and 1d for second class, first class ticket holders merely having priority when boarding. However, the system was unreliable and uneconomic, and closed that December after the company went bankrupt.|$|R
50|$|Renovation {{works to}} upgrade the halt began in April 2007. The new station {{will have a new}} {{concourse}} over the tracks and platforms. The new concourse will have a ticketing booth, ticket vending machines, prayer area and retail outlets. It will also have a common entrance to the two platforms where previously, they could only be accessed through separate gates. The new halt will also have <b>lifts</b> <b>for</b> <b>passengers</b> to access the platforms, making the halt disabled-friendly. The weather shelters will be replaced with a single high-cover over the entire waiting areas of both sides and over the tracks. The renovation works, which cost RM6 million, are expected to be completed by mid October 2007. The halt however continues to operate although certain areas have been closed off and the entrances relocated.|$|R
50|$|The GT8N-1 is {{the second}} {{generation}} of low-floor tramcars in Bremen. Its task is to replace older GT4 Wegmann vehicles and to provide increased comfort <b>for</b> BSAG <b>passengers.</b> Therefore, several changes were made compared to the older GT8N low-floor cars. The width of the car has been increased to 2.65 m, which makes the interior more spacious and allows the introduction of four seats abreast; altogether 106 seats are available. Passenger air-conditioning has also been installed, while five low-floor doorways and a <b>lift</b> <b>for</b> disabled <b>passengers</b> facilitate entry <b>for</b> all <b>passengers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Maersk Delft, {{like her}} sister ships, has been {{designed}} with separate roll-on roll-off decks for freight and cars, which greatly reduces the loading and unloading times. Passenger facilities are spread out over two decks and include three restaurants, a bar, shop, childrens play area, games arcade and a Bureau de Change. There are seven <b>lifts</b> <b>for</b> carrying <b>passengers,</b> crew and stores from the lower car and freight decks up to the passenger and crew decks. The crew accommodation is located on a separate deck and includes cabins, a dayroom, offices, laundry, stores and crew mess.|$|R
5|$|Refurbishment and {{improvement}} works completed in 2007 included new and reconstructed cross bridges between platforms and {{the installation of}} <b>lifts</b> <b>for</b> mobility impaired <b>passengers.</b> Cosmetic improvements carried {{out at the same}} time included the reinstatement of pole-mounted roundels {{on the sides of the}} entrance vestibule. Other work in the 2000s at the station includes the construction of a substantial air rights building spanning across the cutting.|$|R
50|$|Elsternwick was {{upgraded}} to a premium station on 13 November 1995. The ground-level {{station car park}} was closed in 2002 and 2003 and a residential/retail development was built on it, {{as part of a}} deal under which a developer was given the land with the condition that a multi-storey car park, including a <b>lift,</b> was provided <b>for</b> <b>passengers.</b> The station itself was refurbished in 2004.|$|R
5000|$|As {{with most}} Merseyrail stations, {{it has a}} ticket office that is fully staffed from start of service until after the last train has left (closing shortly after midnight). There is also a ticket machine available. There is a {{refreshment}} vending machine provided and waiting shelters on each platform, with train running information provided by automated announcements and digital display screens. The ramps to the platform and the footbridge both have steps, {{but there is a}} <b>lift</b> available <b>for</b> disabled <b>passengers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The wire ropes are {{stressed}} by fluctuating forces, by wear, by corrosion and in seldom cases by extreme forces. The rope life is finite {{and the safety}} is only ensured by inspection {{for the detection of}} wire breaks on a reference rope length, of cross-section loss, as well as other failures so that the wire rope can be replaced before a dangerous situation occurs. Installations should be designed to facilitate the inspection of the wire ropes. [...] <b>Lifting</b> installations <b>for</b> <b>passenger</b> transportation require that a combination of several methods should be used to prevent a car from plunging downwards. Elevators must have redundant bearing ropes and a safety gear. Ropeways and mine hoistings must be permanently supervised by a responsible manager and the rope must be inspected by a magnetic method capable of detecting inner wire breaks.|$|R
50|$|The New Terminal {{building}} {{consisting of}} two (2) floors with an area of almost 12.000m2, can accommodate 2,500 passengers and replaces the old terminal building which is only enough <b>for</b> 250 <b>passengers.</b> The New Terminal building was built from 2013 to 2015 financed by APBN. The ground floor serves {{as a place to}} check in, drop off, baggage claim, as well as public and employee areas. While on the second floor, serves as a waiting room, and public areas and employees. Mosque which is located downstairs and upstairs, lactation rooms, escalator, <b>lifts,</b> toilets, wheelchair <b>for</b> <b>passenger</b> illness or disability. Also there are two medium-sized lounge and spacious, and the smoking room. Other facilities that have been prepared are x-ray as many as four units, three <b>for</b> <b>passengers</b> and one <b>for</b> freight. The Old Terminal will be used as a Regular Hajj Embarkation.|$|R
5|$|Almost {{from the}} outset, {{overcrowding}} {{has been a}} constant problem, and there have been numerous improvements to the facilities and below-ground arrangements to deal with this. After much discussion between the then two separate operators, a major reconstruction began in 1912. This entailed a new ticket hall, serving both lines, being built {{in the basement of the}} Bakerloo station, with the Bakerloo lifts removed and new deep-level escalators opened down to the Bakerloo line level. Access to the CLR was by way of existing deep-level subways. The new works came into use on 9 May 1914 with the CLR <b>lifts</b> still available <b>for</b> <b>passengers.</b> By 1923 even this rearrangement was unable to cope, so a second rebuilding began. This involved a second set of escalators being built directly down to the Central line and the CLR station building becoming exit-only. On 2 October 1928, a third escalator leading to the Bakerloo platforms was opened. Unusually, lifts came back into prominence at an Underground station when, in 1942, a set of high-speed lifts came into use, largely used as an exit route from the Central line platforms directly to the Argyll Street exit building.|$|R

50|$|In 2007, {{the entire}} station was rebuilt during the {{commissioning}} of the Aachen electronic interlocking. The old freight and storage sidings were greatly scaled back. Prior to the remodelling, the station had two mechanical signal boxes, {{one of which}} controlled the semaphore signals and points <b>for</b> <b>passenger</b> and freight operations at the station. Another signal box called Rr was demolished {{in preparation for the}} construction of the Aachen Arkaden shopping centre in 2004. Meanwhile, the station was equipped with Ks-signals, which are controlled remotely from the Duisburg electronic signalling centre. The island platform was built from scratch and has a height of 76 cm above the top of the rail. The station also received a second access route on the eastern side with a <b>lift</b> <b>for</b> barrier-free access to the platform.|$|R
