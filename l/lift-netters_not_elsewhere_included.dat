40|$|OBJECTIVES: We used {{data from}} {{national}} surveys {{to measure the}} rate of HIV testing in the general US population and among persons at increased behavioral risk and summarized what has been learned about HIV testing from these surveys. METHODS: Three nationally representative surveys were used: the National Health Interview Survey for 1987 through 1995, the 1995 National Survey of Family Growth, and the 1996 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse. These surveys asked about HIV testing experience and behavioral risks for HIV. Rates of testing were computed for all persons, including those {{at increased risk for}} HIV. RESULTS: From 1987 to 1995, the percentage of adults ever tested increased from 16 % to 40 %. The 3 surveys were consistent with one another, and all showed much higher rates of testing for persons at increased risk for HIV. CONCLUSIONS: Surveys have provided information on HIV testing that is <b>not</b> available <b>elsewhere,</b> <b>including</b> rates of testing from private sources and public programs. Efforts to measure HIV testing and its correlates should continue and should be improved to provide information essential for effective programs...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{algebraic}} geometry provides {{a number of}} efficient tools for approximating the solutions of polynomial systems. One such tool is the parameter homotopy, which can be an extremely efficient method to solve numerous polynomial systems that differ only in coefficients, not monomials. This technique is frequently used for solving a parameterized family of polynomial systems at multiple parameter values. Parameter homotopies have recently been useful in several areas of application and have been implemented {{in at least two}} software packages. This article describes Paramotopy, a new, parallel, optimized implementation of this technique, making use of the Bertini software package. The novel features of this implementation, <b>not</b> available <b>elsewhere,</b> <b>include</b> allowing for the simultaneous solutions of arbitrary polynomial systems in a parameterized family on an automatically generated (or manually provided) mesh in the parameter space of coefficients, front ends and back ends that are easily specialized to particular classes of problems, and adaptive techniques for solving polynomial systems near singular points in the parameter space. This last feature automates and simplifies a task that is important but often misunderstood by non-experts. 1...|$|R
40|$|Data {{integrity}} constraints usually form a {{major component}} in a data-intensive business system. To successfully reengineer a data-intensive business system, its data integrity constraints must be understood. Functional dependencies constitute an important type of data integrity constraints. Due {{to the nature of}} system development, a significant amount of functional dependencies is usually omitted during the initial system development stage and only discovered during the system maintenance stage. Usually, these dependencies are enforced in the programs which update the databases, and are <b>not</b> shown <b>elsewhere</b> <b>including</b> the databases. Existing approaches for the discovery of functional dependencies from databases cannot find such functional dependencies. We develop a theory for inferring functional dependencies in a database from the programs which update the database. With the use of the theory, a comprehensive approach for the recovery of functional dependencies from both database schemas and programs is consequently proposed. The proposed approach can recover those functional dependencies which cannot be found by the existing approaches. The functional dependencies recovered from the proposed approach are proven. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Deciding which health {{technologies}} to fund involves confronting {{some of the}} most difficult choices in medicine. As for other countries, the Israeli health system is faced each year with having to make these difficult decisions. The Public National Advisory Committee, known as ‘the Basket Committee’, selects new technologies for the basic list of health care that all Israelis are entitled to access, known as the ‘health basket’. We introduce a framework for health technology prioritization based explicitly on value for money that enables the main variables considered by decision-makers to be explicitly included. Although the framework’s exposition is in terms of the Basket Committee selecting new technologies for Israel’s health basket, we believe that the framework would also work well for other countries. Methods Our proposed prioritization framework involves comparing four main variables for each technology: 1. Incremental benefits, including ‘equity benefits’, to Israel’s population; 2. Incremental total cost to Israel’s health system; 3. Quality of evidence; and 4. Any additional ‘X-factors’ <b>not</b> <b>elsewhere</b> <b>included,</b> such as strategic or legal factors, etc. Applying methodology from multi-criteria decision analysis, the multiple dimensions comprising the first variable are aggregated via a points system. Results The four variables are combined for each technology and compared across the technologies in the ‘Value for Money (VfM) Chart’. The VfM Chart can be used to identify technologies that are good value for money, and, given a budget constraint, to select technologies that should be funded. This is demonstrated using 18 illustrative technologies. Conclusions The VfM Chart is an intuitively appealing decision-support tool for helping decision-makers to focus on the inherent tradeoffs involved in health technology prioritization. Such deliberations can be performed in a systematic and transparent fashion that can also be easily communicated to stakeholders, including the general public. Possible future research includes pilot-testing the VfM Chart using real-world data. Ideally, this would involve working with the Basket Committee. Likewise, the framework could be tested and applied by health technology prioritization agencies in other countries. </p...|$|R
40|$|The arid and {{extremely}} arid {{areas of the}} Middle East are outlined, and {{the past and present}} climatic regimes within these areas considered and related to the existing rock and soil conditions. A system of classification of the ground into four simple zones based on their desert characteristics and the natural processes operating within the zone is described. The general engineering character of each zone is discussed and particular problems highlighted. Zone I is the mountainous areas, zone II the large gravel fans bounding mountains, zone III the alluvial plains beyond the fans, and zone IV the central base level plains between mountains or adjacent to coasts. The great majority of desert soils are granular and their engineering behaviour is directly related to their grading characteristics. Flooding is an important hazard in the fans and alluvial plains, while in the base level plains high water tables are of major importance. Ground conditions of signifi-cance in deserts, which do <b>not</b> generally occur <b>elsewhere</b> <b>include</b> aggressive salty ground, wind blown sands and silts, and hard and soft duricrusts. These and certain other ground conditions are described...|$|R
