5|$|American {{historian}} Richard Landes, {{who specializes}} {{in the history of}} apocalypticism and was co-founder and director of the Center for Millennial Studies at Boston University, argues that new and emerging technologies often trigger alarmism among millenarians and even the introduction of Gutenberg's printing press in 1436 caused waves of apocalyptic thinking. The Year 2000 problem, bar codes and Social Security numbers all triggered end-time warnings which either proved to be false or simply were no longer taken seriously once the public became accustomed to these technological changes. Civil libertarians argue that the privatization of surveillance {{and the rise of the}} surveillance-industrial complex in the United States does raise <b>legitimate</b> <b>concerns</b> about the erosion of privacy. However, skeptics of mass surveillance conspiracism caution that such concerns should be disentangled from secular paranoia about Big Brother or religious hysteria about the Antichrist.|$|E

25|$|<b>Legitimate</b> <b>concerns</b> {{about water}} supply were {{exploited}} to gain backing {{for a huge}} engineering and legal effort to bring more water {{to the city and}} allow more development. The city fathers had their eyes on the Owens River, about 250 miles (400km) northeast of Los Angeles in Inyo County, near the Nevada state line. It was a permanent stream of fresh water fed by the melted snows of the eastern Sierra Nevada. It flowed through the Owens River Valley before emptying into the shallow, saline Owens Lake, where it evaporated.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the Italian {{declaration}} of war on 10 June 1940, Balbo was the Governor-General of Libya and Commander-in-Chief of Italian North Africa (Africa Settentrionale Italiana, or ASI). He became responsible for planning an invasion of Egypt. After the surrender of France, Balbo was able to shift much of the men and materiel of the Italian Fifth Army on the Tunisian border to the Tenth Army on the Egyptian border. While he had expressed many <b>legitimate</b> <b>concerns</b> to Mussolini and to Marshal Pietro Badoglio, the Chief-of-Staff in Rome, Balbo still planned to invade Egypt in early July.|$|E
25|$|Despite Boyle's efforts, the {{political}} pressure exerted by the black-lung miners {{was effective in}} the long run. Media images of hacking, dying miners -- most of them young men in their 30s and 40s -- caused a public outcry. Throughout the lobbying effort for the bill, Miller accused UMWA of ignoring rank-and-file miners' needs. This undercut Boyle's power, which rested on his claim that he alone represented the <b>legitimate</b> <b>concerns</b> of mine workers. On February 18, 1969, Miller {{and thousands of other}} West Virginia miners launched a 23-day wildcat strike to demand enactment of the black-lung bill. The strike led the legislature to pass the bill, which was {{the first of its kind}} in the U.S.|$|E

25|$|Still, it too {{has gone}} through some controversies over its lifetime. There were criticisms, some {{legitimate}} like the perceived costly entry fees and subpar tracks that hosted nationals. There were also complaints of scheduling conflicts with the rival NBL and NBA; rules discrimination and the general politics between the sanctioning bodies and promoters. Most of these concerns were the worry {{of some of the}} governing officers of the ABA and outside observers in the BMX press. However, {{with the exception of the}} issues of entrance fees and the quality of the national tracks, the rank in file racers and families were largely oblivious. They were seeing well run races that met the needs of the consumer. This was reflected by the growth rate and attendance levels at both the local level and at its Nationals. The in house tabloid newspaper, ABA Action, was as efficient as the organization itself with its always current listings of points standings and race coverage, which were of course the direct concern of the rank and file racers. The ABA served the majority's needs and not the concerns, even the <b>legitimate</b> <b>concerns</b> of the Professional and top Expert racers, the BMX Press and the in house politicking between ABA officers.|$|E

Other coworkers said that Mitchell had <b>legitimate</b> <b>concerns</b> {{about the quality of}} the physician's patient care; they said that Mitchell first raised the issues with the hospital's administration, but that her concerns were not addressed. In one incident, Arafiles was alleged to have performed a skin graft on an emergency room patient even though he was not credentialed to perform surgery at the facility. Another patient came to the hospital with a crushed finger and Arafiles allegedly took a rubber tip off of a pair of medical scissors and stitched it onto the patient's finger.|$|E
