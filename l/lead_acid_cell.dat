It is standard lore that the voltage profile varies linearly in space within the electrolyte of a <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> <b>cell</b> under slow, steady discharge. However, this hypothesis has never been put to the test. A recent theory predicts a uniform, non-zero charge density in the bulk of the electrolyte, an electric field that varies linearly across the cell and a voltage prose that varies quadratically. To test this theory, experiments were performed, using platinum reference electrodes to read the voltage probes during periods of charge and discharge. Such experiments revealed quadratic voltage probes, but of a specific form that has not yet been explained. Perhaps more interesting than the quadratic voltage profiles under slow, steady charge and discharge was our observation of (different) quadratic voltage profiles in the zero current state. This can be explained {{within the context of the}} theory as due to the non-current-carrying (non-faradaic) reactions. As a test of the experimental set-up, voltage-jump readings were measured in the electrolyte at the onset and discontinuation of charge and discharge processes, revealing the expected linear voltage-jump probes across the cell...|$|E

40|$|Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The reduction of. electrodeposited P-lead dioxide to lead sulphate in 5 M sulphuric acid has been studied at the stationary and RDE. Potential step and sweep experiments have been made and {{a model for the}} discharge process of lead dioxide has been proposed based on charge transfer and limited high field conduction. T'he potentiostatic oxidations of lead sulphate overlying lead and lead dioxide have been investigated. The reduction behaviour of porous one-dimensional lead dioxide electrodes have been examined and shown to be independant of rotation speed in a large excess of 5 M sulphuric acid. The reduction peak was broadened by the porosity. This broadening was interpreted in terms of the reaction being driven more deeply into the pore structure as the front of the electrode becomes progressively more resistive. The effect of different potential sweep rates on the current response and effects of progressive redox cycles can be fully explained on this model. The potentiostatic oxidation of porous electrodes of lead dioxide containing lead sulphate has also been investigated. The form of the current transient was found to depend on the balance of lead sulphate and lead dioxide. Investigations have been carried out on the above electrodes using the techniques of scanning electron microscopy and alternating current. Possible interpretations of the results are discussed. The influence of the solid/porous material interphase on the electrode behaviour has been investigated for a variety of alloy supports with special reference to the charge output on reduction, ease of reoxidation and electrode support/porous phase adhesion.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that a {{conventional}} <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> <b>cell</b> that is exposed to a partial state of charge capacity cycling (PSoCCC) would experience a build-up of irreversible PbSO 4 on the negative electrode. This results into a damaged negative electrode due to excessive PbSO 4 formation by the typical visual “Venetian Blinds” effect of the active material. This displays the loss of adhesion of the active material with the electrode’s grids thereby making large sections of the material ineffective and reducing the cells useful capacity during high current applications. The addition of certain graphites to the negative paste mix had proven to be successful to reduce this effect. In {{the first part of the}} study, the physical and chemical properties of the various additives that are added to the negative electrode paste mix were comparatively studied. This was done to investigate any significant differences between various suppliers that could possibly influence the electrochemical characteristics of the Pb-acid battery performance. This comparative study was done by using the following analytical techniques; BET surface area, laser diffraction particle size, PXRD, TGA-MS and SEM. The study showed that there were no significant differences between the additives supplied from different suppliers except for some anomalies in the usefulness of techniques such as N 2 adsorption to study the BET surface area of BaSO 4. In order to reduce the sulphation effect from occurring within the Pb-acid battery a number of adjustments are made to the electrode active material. For example, Pb-acid battery manufacturers make use of an inert polymer based material, known as Polymat, to cover the electrode surfaces as part of their continuous electrode pasting process. It is made from a non woven polyester fiber that is applied to the pasted electrodes during the continuous pasting process. In this study the Polymat pasted electrodes has demonstrated a better physical adhesion of the active material to the grid support thereby maintaining the active material’s physical integrity. This however did not reduce the sulphation effect due to the high rate partial state of capacity cycling (HRPSoCCC) test but reduced the physical damage due to the irreversible active material blistering effect. The study investigated what effect the Polymat on the electrodes has on the III battery’s Cold Cranking Ability (CCA) at - 18 degree C, the HRPSoCCC cycling and its active material utilization. The study showed that there was little or no differences in the CCA and HRPSoCCC capabilities of cells made with the Polymat when compared to cells without the Polymat, with significant improvement in active material’s adhesion and integrity to the grid wire. This was confirmed by PXRD and SEM analysis. Negative electrodes were made with four types of graphites (natural, flake, expanded and nano fibre) added to the negative paste mixture in order to reduce the effect of sulphation. The study looked at using statistical design of experiment (DoE) principles to investigate the variables (additives) such as different graphites, BaSO 4 and Vanisperse to the negative electrode paste mixture where upon measuring the responses (electrochemical tests) a set of controlled experiments were done to study the extent of the variables interaction, dependency and independency on the cells electrochemical properties. This was especially in relation to the improvement of the battery’s ability to work under HRPSoCCC. The statistical analysis showed that there was a notable significant influence of the amounts of vanisperse, BaSO 4 and their respective interactions on a number of electrochemical responses, such as the Peukert constant (n), CCA discharge time, material utilization at different discharge rates and the ability to capacity cycle under the simulated HRPSoCCC testing. The study did not suggest an optimized concentration of the additives, but did give an indication that there was a statistical significant trend in certain electrochemical responses with an interaction between the amounts of the additives BaSO 4 and Vanisperse. The study also showed that the addition of a small amount of Nano carbon can significantly change the observed crystal morphology of the negative active material and that an improvement in the number of capacity cycles can be achieved during the HRPSoCCC test when compared to the other types of graphite additive...|$|E

40|$|As the {{implementation}} of 42 volt systems is being phased into commercial vehicles, the battery technology is being developed with little time for adequate long-term testing and modeling to assess battery performance before their implementation into vehicles. This makes the development of battery monitoring and management systems for these 42 volt systems critical for long-term reliability. Furthermore, these battery monitoring and management systems must be developed rapidly and be adaptable to the changing characteristics of the batteries as they age. Over the last five years, Villanova University and US Nanocorp have been jointly developing patented fuzzy logic-based technology [1 - 3] for estimating the state-of-charge (SOC) and state-of-health (SOH) of batteries. This methodology {{has proven to be}} both a simple and a powerful means to model battery characteristics accurately and robustly.

Solar power is accepted as an environmentally advantaged renewable power source.

The incumbent technology of <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> <b>cells</b> is large, toxic to produce and dispose of, and offer limited life even with significant maintenance. The ideal PV storage battery would have the safety and low cost of <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> but the performance of lithium ion chemistry.

The purpose of this project is to develop new lithium ion cells that can meet PVES cost and safety requirements using A 123 Systems phosphate-based cathode chemistries in commercial PHEV cell formats. The cost target is a cell design for a home or neighborhood scale at <$ 25 /kWh. This DOE program is the continuation and expansion of an initial MPSC (Michigan Public Service Commission) program towards this goal. This program further pushes the initial limits of some aspects of the original program â even lower cost anode and cathode actives implemented at even higher electrode loadings, and as well explores new avenues of cost reduction via new materials â specifically our higher voltage cathode. The challenge in our materials development is to achieve parity in the performance metrics of cycle life and high temperature storage, and to produce quality materials at the production scale. Our new cathode material, M 1 X, has a higher voltage and so requires electrolyte reformulation to meet the high temperature storage requirements. The challenge of thick electrode systems is to maintain adequate adhesion and cycle life.

40|$|<b>Lead</b> <b>acid</b> {{batteries}} {{are widely used}} in domestic, industrial and automotive applications. Even after lot of advancements in battery technologies, <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> <b>cells</b> are still in use because of their high capacity and low cost. To use any battery effectively, first {{we should be able}} to identify the available capacity or State of Charge (SoC). There are many techniques available to measure SoC of a <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> battery. One such unique method is to measure the capacity using eddy current sensors. This method is unique because it is non-obtrusive and online. Eddy current sensors (ECS) are wire wound inductors which work on the principle of electromagnetic induction. Eddy currents are the currents generated on a conductive material when it is kept in a varying magnetic. Eddy current sensors generate varying magnetic eldest and will be able to identify the properties of conductive materials like thickness, conductivity, material composition etc. Also they can be used as proximity sensors. <b>Lead</b> <b>acid</b> batteries use <b>lead</b> metal as cathode. Upon usage(discharge) the lead metal converts to lead sulfate and revert back to lead after charging. These changes in lead electrode can be monitored using eddy current sensors. The impedance of an eddy current sensor will change when it is kept close to the lead electrode when the battery is charging or discharging. These impedance parameters can be monitored to determine the battery SoC. When lead is deposited on cathode, there will be more eddy current loss in the target and the total resistance of coil increases. On the other hand, when lead is deposited on the electrode because of increase in the magnitude of eddy currents which oppose the source magnetic, the total inductance of coil decreases. We can observe exactly opposite behaviour of coil resistance and inductance when the lead electrode is converted to less conductive lead sulfate. There is a lot of research on using ECS to measure SoC of <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> batteries and there are still many challenges to be addressed. First we have explained about different circuit designs we have used to monitor the battery capacity using eddy current sensors. After that, we have explained about our complete experimental setup and the procedure to measure the sensor parameters using the setup. Then, we have discussed about different issues involved in the eddy current sensing based state of charge measurement. Eddy current sensors are affected by temperature variations. We have studied the coil resistance behaviour with temperature at different frequencies using simulations and experiments. We have obtained the conditions for linear variation of coil resistance with temperature. The measured temperature compensation scheme is applied and the results are discussed. We have also modified the measurement system design in order to minimize the lift o errors. We have used a metallic clamp structure to minimize the lift o errors. We have used finite element analysis based simulations to study different design parameters and their effect on the sensitivity of eddy current sensor. We have created 2 D eddy current models and the sensitivity of coil resistance is computed by changing the coil dimensions and the core permeability. We have also performed error analysis and computed the error due to the tilt angle shift between coil and electrode. We have also computed the error due to the internal heating of battery. We have also studied the effect of acid strati cation on state of charge for both sealed and hooded batteries. We have proposed a multi coil method to minimize the errors in SoC measurement due to acid strati cation for Flooded type batteries. We have used finite element analysis based simulations to compute the error due to acid strati cation by increasing the number of coils. Finally we have derived the equation for electrode Q factor using the transformer model of eddy current sensor. The derived Q factor equation is then used to study the aging of <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> batteries both by using experiments and simulations. Finally we have explained a detail procedure to measure the state of charge(SoC) and state of health(SoH) of a hooded <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> battery using eddy current sensing method...|$|R

The efficient and prudent use of lead is at best difficult at a time that <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> batteries are being called upon to provide backup power for critical power applications. This study seeks to use <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> batteries efficiently thereby reducing the amount of <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> in our environment. The research consisted of a case study of US electrical power substations, an integral part of the power grid. The case analysis compared traditional maintenance practices of <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> batteries versus the use of battery condition monitoring. There is a strong business case to be made for investing in condition monitoring to manage the battery assets within power substations. This will ensure that the batteries will function when required. The case study demonstrated that once condition monitoring was installed the number of preventative maintenance visits to a remote site was reduced by 85 % with a commensurate reduction in the number of medium duty trucks on the nation’s roads. The avoided CO 2 emissions presented a compelling argument for condition monitoring. Condition monitoring and the resultant condition based maintenance will drive infrastructure reliability higher and result in the more efficient use of <b>lead</b> <b>acid</b> batteries with the added benefit of CO 2 reductions. There are hundreds of other applications for this technology and with strong management buy-in it is possible to overcome the resistance to change from traditional maintenance practices...|$|R
