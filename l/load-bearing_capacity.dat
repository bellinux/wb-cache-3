5|$|The {{detailed}} {{design for the}} project was completed during summer 2006 and construction began in January 2007. The first task was to build a stable access road, but the moor was covered in a layer of peat with a low <b>load-bearing</b> <b>capacity.</b> The whole area had also been subjected to extensive coal mining during the 19th and early 20th centuries, {{so there was a}} potential for subsidence. To address these problems, the mining voids were grouted and a floating road was constructed, using a complex system of geotextiles and geogrids to prevent the road from sinking. This was achieved by laying a crushed-gravel base, reinforced with polyester and polypropylene grids, to bridge any potential mine voids and ensure that the weak shear strength of the subsoil was exceeded by the base course material.|$|E

The bottom chord of the span is [...] above the Blackledge River. The truss is [...] long and about [...] deep. The top and bottom chords are typical box girders with diagonal members and the deck is open. At some point, the bridge was altered {{with the addition of a}} sewer pipe.|$|E
2500|$|Marble is {{not found}} {{especially}} close to Rome, {{and was only}} rarely used there before Augustus, who famously boasted {{that he had found}} Rome made of brick and left it made of marble, though this was mainly as a facing for brick or concrete.

A set of test data were used to verify the FE modeling. generally, good agreement was achieved. Typical curves of moment (M) versus deflection at mid-span (um), as well as stress distributions of steel tube and concrete of the composite members were compared and discussed.

2500|$|Prefabricated piles {{are driven}} into the ground using a pile driver. Driven piles are either wood, {{reinforced}} concrete, or steel. Wooden piles are made from the trunks of tall trees. Concrete piles are available in square, octagonal, and round cross-sections (like Franki piles). They are reinforced with rebar and are often prestressed. Steel piles are either pipe piles {{or some sort of}} beam section (like an H-pile). Historically, wood piles used splices to join multiple segments end-to-end when the driven depth required was too long for a single pile; today, splicing is common with steel piles, though concrete piles can be spliced with mechanical and other means. Driving piles, as opposed to drilling shafts, is advantageous because the soil displaced by driving the piles compresses the surrounding soil, causing greater friction against the sides of the piles, thus increasing their <b>load-bearing</b> <b>capacity.</b> Driven piles are also considered to be [...] "tested" [...] for weight-bearing ability because of their method of installation; thus the motto of the Pile Driving Contractors' Association is [...] "A Driven Pile...Is a Tested Pile!".|$|E
2500|$|Soil {{stabilization}} is {{the permanent}} {{physical and chemical}} alteration of soils to enhance their physical properties. Stabilization can increase the shear strength of a soil and/or control the shrink-swell properties of a soil, thus improving the <b>load-bearing</b> <b>capacity</b> of a sub-grade to support pavements and foundations. Stabilization {{can be used to}} treat a wide range of sub-grade materials from expansive clays to granular materials. Stabilization can be achieved with a variety of chemical additives including lime, fly ash, and Portland cement. Proper design and testing is an important component of any stabilization project. This allows for the establishment of design criteria, and determination of the proper chemical additive and admixture rate that achieves the desired engineering properties. Stabilization process benefits can include: Higher resistance (R) values, Reduction in plasticity, Lower permeability, Reduction of pavement thickness, Elimination of excavation - material hauling/handling - and base importation, Aids compaction, Provides [...] "all-weather" [...] access onto and within projects sites. Another form of soil treatment closely related to soil stabilization is soil modification, sometimes referred to as [...] "mud drying" [...] or soil conditioning. Although some stabilization inherently occurs in soil modification, the distinction is that soil modification is merely a means to reduce the moisture content of a soil to expedite construction, whereas stabilization can substantially increase the shear strength of a material such that it can be incorporated into the project's structural design. The determining factors associated with soil modification vs soil stabilization may be the existing moisture content, the end use of the soil structure and ultimately the cost benefit provided. Equipment for the stabilization and modification processes include: chemical additive spreaders, soil mixers (reclaimers), portable pneumatic storage containers, water trucks, deep lift compactors, motor graders.|$|E

40|$|Loosening of bolted {{connections}} in a structure can signifi-cantly reduce the <b>load-bearing</b> <b>capacities</b> of the structure. De-tecting loosening of {{bolted connections}} {{at an early}} stage can avoid failure of the structure. Due to the complex geometry of a bolted connection and the material discontinuity between the clamped components, it is difficult to detect loosening of a bolted connection using conventional non-destructive test methods. A vibration-based method that uses changes in natural frequencies of a structure to detect the locations and extent of damage can be used to detect loosening of bolted connections, since the method focuses on detecting a stiffness reduction, which can result from loosening of the bolted connections.

A CBR of 3 equates to tilled farmland, a CBR of 4.75 equates to turf or moist clay, while moist sand may have a CBR of 10. High quality crushed rock has a CBR over 80. The standard material for this test is crushed California limestone which has a value of 100, meaning that it is not unusual to see CBR values of over 100 in well compacted areas.|$|E
5000|$|Louis Sullivan was an {{architect}} from Chicago who achieved peak prominence {{as a designer}} of early skyscrapers during {{the end of the}} 19th century. In the 1880s, with the development of the mass production of steel, it became possible to construct buildings on steel frames. Previously, the height of buildings was limited by the <b>load-bearing</b> <b>capacities</b> of the outer walls of buildings. With the mass production of steel, steel frames for buildings could be erected and buildings could be constructed by hanging them from steel frames, thereby eliminating the need for thick load-bearing outer walls. This new construction technique allowed the construction of very tall buildings and Louis Sullivan was concerned with how to express this [...] "newness" [...] in design, capturing [...] "good ol' American know-how" [...] in the design of these new buildings.|$|R

30|$|Compared {{to other}} {{construction}} materials, concrete provides superior fire resistance {{as a result}} of its low thermal conductivity and incombustible nature. Proper design of typical concrete structures for fire resistance simply requires selection of appropriate member dimensions and concrete covers. Yet, exposure of concrete to long duration fires or elevated temperatures adversely affects its compressive and flexural strengths, modulus of elasticity and volume stability among other mechanical properties (Chan et al. 1999; Luo et al. 2000; Husem 2006; Arioz 2007, 2009; Netinger et al. 2011). Significant losses in the compressive strength of concrete ranging between 50 and 70 % are typically encountered at temperatures above 550  °C (Georgali and Tsakiridis 2005). Depending on the extent of fire-induced damages and the residual <b>load-bearing</b> <b>capacities,</b> it is often both technically and economically viable to repair and reuse concrete structures after fire.|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{method is}} {{presented in this paper}} for determining the <b>load-bearing</b> <b>capacities</b> of ductile composites such as metal matrix composites based on homoge-nization theory and the kinematic limit theorem. A representative volume element is chosen to re®ect the microstructure of a periodic composite.

The damages to the masonry structures might be attributed to insuffi cient soil properties, non-conformity with relevant regulations, design and application defects and wear. This study experimentally investigates the strengthening of the masonry structures on one side as historical structural walls can only be strengthened on one side in most cases. In the experimental works conducted within the scope of the study, the brick wall specimens, some of which are pre-damaged, are strengthened on one side using carbon fi bre reinforced polymers (CFRPs) in different forms. Comparisons are made between the change in the <b>load-bearing</b> <b>capacities</b> and behaviours of the specimens following the strengthening. It is determined that the brick wall specimens without reinforcement exhibit brittle behaviour, whereas the performances of the brick wall specimens strengthened with CFRP improve in strength ratings as well as energy dissipation capacities.

In this approach, new bone cells are stimulated to grow and heal the defect {{with the aid of}} a scaffold that serves as a medium for bone cell formation and growth. Scaffolds made of metallic materials have preferably been chosen for bone {{tissue engineering}} applications where <b>load-bearing</b> <b>capacities</b> are required, considering the superior mechanical properties possessed by this type of materials to those of polymeric and ceramic materials. The space holder method has been recognized as one of the viable methods for the fabrication of metallic biomedical scaffolds. In this method, temporary powder particles, namely space holder, are devised as a pore former for scaffolds. In general, the whole scaffold fabrication process with the space holder method can be divided into four main steps: (i) mixing of metal matrix powder and space-holding particles; (ii) compaction of granular materials; (iii) removal of space-holding particles; (iv) sintering of porous scaffold preform. In this review, detailed procedures in each of these steps are presented. Technical challenges encountered during scaffold fabrication with this specific method are addressed.
