This study aims to shed light on <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> <b>planning</b> processes in China, and to highlight the characteristics and contents of thematic maps in provincial-level planning. The study area, Hubei Province, has an area of 1, 85, 900 km 2 and is located in Central China. The land consolidation potential, that is, the net increase area of arable land was calculated according to the land consolidation types in each county. The spatial characteristics of land consolidation potential, key areas, and key engineering and projects were presented on a scale of 1 : 5, 00, 000 utilizing counties as evaluation units. The thematic maps can provide important information for policymakers and planning workers, and guide any subsequent <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> <b>planning</b> at the county level in China. © 2013 Yaolin Liu. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Large-scale {{infrastructure}} projects require {{the acquisition of}} appropriate land for their construction and maintenance, while they often cause extensive fragmentations of the affected landscape and land plots as well as significant land loss of the immediately affected land owners. A good practice in this field comes from Germany. In Germany, the so-called “land consolidation for large-scale projects” is used to distribute the land loss among a larger group of land owners and to reduce the damages caused by land dissection. In this article, the results of detailed analyses of the <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> for large-scale projects’ procedures in Germany are presented. The procedure is coordinated by the <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> authority, which has to check several formal and content requirements before implementing a <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> procedure. The needed land for the large-scale infrastructure project has to be provided by {{the owners of the}} land plots in the <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> area by selling it to the developer, by balanced land-loss following the <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> <b>plan</b> or relinquishment of re-allocation of particular land owners.

To maintain a sustainable urbanization, two important issues of land-use {{need to be}} quantified: the comprehensive variation of urban-rural construction land and the specific models for consolidating these lands. The {{purpose of this study}} is to develop a framework to assess the change of urban-rural construction land and build a decision-support system for consolidating these lands. Four sub-layers were first built in the assessment framework, including the characteristic layer, the coordination layer, the potential layer and the urgency layer. Each layer encompassed specific indices for evaluating the change of urban-rural construction land in different aspects. The entropy method was then applied to the data resources from Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) images, statistical data and overall land-use and <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> <b>planning</b> of Nantong city in coastal China to allocate weightings to the indices in each sub-layer. Finally, the decision-support system was built based on the assessment results and the degree of importance for consolidating urban and rural construction land, respectively.

40|$|Land {{fragmentation}} is {{a widespread}} situation which may often hinder agricultural development. Land consolidation {{is considered to be}} the most effective land management planning approach for controlling land fragmentation and hence improving agricultural efficiency. Land partitioning is a basic process of land consolidation that involves the subdivision of land into smaller sub-spaces subject to a number of constraints. This paper explains the development of a module called LandParcelS (Land Parcelling System) that is a part of an integrated planning and decision support system called LACONISS (LAndCONsolidation Integrated Support System) which has been developed to assist <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> <b>planning</b> in Cyprus. LandParcelS automates the land partitioning process by designing and optimising land parcels in terms of their shape, size and value. The methodology integrates geographical information systems and a genetic algorithm that has been applied to two land blocks that are part of a larger case study area in Cyprus. Partitioning is treated as either a single or multi-objective problem for various optimisation cases. The results suggest that a step forward has been made in solving this complex spatial problem, although {{further research is needed to}} improve the algorithm. This approach may have relevance to other spatial planning tasks that involve single or multi-objective optimisation problems, especially those dealing with space partitioning...|$|E

40|$|Land {{fragmentation}} is a {{major problem}} in many countries around the world since it hinders rational agricultural development and sustainable rural development. Land consolidation is the most favoured land management approach for solving land fragmentation. Land consolidation consists of two main components: the reallocation of land and the provision of public infrastructure. Currently, land reallocation experiences major problems such as the long duration of projects, the high operational costs involved and the conflicts of interest among stakeholders. Land reallocation, the most important, complex and time-consuming part of the land consolidation process, is split into two sub-processes: land redistribution and land partitioning. The former involves decision making regarding restructuring land tenure whilst the latter involves design regarding partitioning of land into parcels. The literature review shows that existing land fragmentation indices present significant weaknesses and hence they may lead to sub-optimal decisions. In addition, land reallocation is currently not adequately supported by existing information systems (e. g. GIS) and, although relevant research has been ongoing since the 1960 s, the process has not been automated and supported in a systematic, efficient and reliable manner so as to alleviate the associated problems. Thus, the aim of this research is to develop a prototype system called LACONISS (LAnd CONsolidation Integrated Support System for planning and decision making) by integrating GIS, expert systems (ES), genetic algorithms (GAs) and multi-criteria decision methods (MCDM), both multi-attribute (MADM) and multi-objective (MODM) within a common GIS environment. The system consists of four primary models for: measuring land fragmentation (LandFragmentS); automatically generating alternative land redistribution plans (LandSpaCES Design); evaluating these plans (LandSpaCES Evaluation); and designing/optimising the land partitioning plan (LandParcelS). All models have been applied in a case study area in Cyprus showing that: LandFragmentS outperforms existing indices; LandSpaCES Design can efficiently and applicably solve land redistribution; LandSpaCES Evaluation is a flexible and useful tool involving innovative evaluation criteria and; LandParcelS produces encouraging results indicating a step forward for solving land partitioning as both single and multi-objective problems. The original contribution of this research is that it has provided a new scientific framework for <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> <b>planning</b> both in terms of theory and practice, by discovering new knowledge and by developing better tools and methods embedded in an integrated GIS environment. In addition, the broader contribution of the research concerns the GIS and spatial planning fields because it provides new methods and ideas that could be applied to improve the former {{for the benefit of the}} latter.

40|$|Public {{awareness}} regarding {{key issues}} of biodiversity and ecosystem services {{gave rise to}} several policies aiming at their consideration in human activities. These policies led {{to a bunch of}} legal constraints and incentives that are as many tools to preserve and restore both biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, these tools are often activated in a punctual way, following private initiatives or opportunities and without much reflection about the stakes beyond the actors’ own interests. This results in scattered actions, a lack of cohesion in land planning and sometimes conflicts between stakeholders. Yet biodiversity and ecosystem services need a collaborative management, beyond the individualist approach, to ensure the success and continuity of launched projects. Two case studies illustrate the collaborative and structured application of diverse tools by and for a variety of stakeholders willing to respond to specific needs. The first case is biodiversity-oriented, as it concerns the conservation of Bromus grossus, a plant species listed in Annex II of the Natura 2000 “Habitat” directive, which only grows in agroecosystems.
