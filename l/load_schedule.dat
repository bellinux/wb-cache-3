40|$|New load {{schedules}} for {{the machine}} calibration of a six-component force balance {{are currently being}} developed and evaluated at the NASA Ames Balance Calibration Laboratory. One of the proposed load schedules is discussed in the paper. It has a total of 2082 points that are distributed across 16 load series. Several criteria were applied to define the <b>load</b> <b>schedule.</b> It was decided, for example, to specify the calibration load set in force balance format as this approach greatly simplifies {{the definition of the}} lower and upper bounds of the <b>load</b> <b>schedule.</b> In addition, all loads are assumed to be applied in a calibration machine by using the one-factor-at-a-time approach. At first, all single-component loads are applied in six load series. Then, three two-component load series are applied. They consist of the load pairs (N 1, N 2), (S 1, S 2), and (RM, AF). Afterwards, four three-component load series are applied. They consist of the combinations (N 1, N 2, AF), (S 1, S 2, AF), (N 1, N 2, RM), and (S 1, S 2, RM). In the next step, one four-component load series is applied. It is the load combination (N 1, N 2, S 1, S 2). Finally, two five-component load series are applied. They are the load combination (N 1, N 2, S 1, S 2, AF) and (N 1, N 2, S 1, S 2, RM). The maximum difference between loads of two subsequent data points of the <b>load</b> <b>schedule</b> is limited to 33 % of capacity. This constraint helps avoid unwanted load "jumps" in the <b>load</b> <b>schedule</b> that can {{have a negative impact on}} the performance of a calibration machine. Only loadings of the single- and two-component load series are loaded to 100 % of capacity. This approach was selected because it keeps the total number of calibration points to a reasonable limit while still allowing for the application of some of the more complex load combinations. Data from two of NASA's force balances is used to illustrate important characteristics of the proposed 2082 -point calibration <b>load</b> <b>schedule...</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{baseline}} <b>load</b> <b>schedule</b> for {{the manual}} calibration of a force balance is defined that takes current capabilities at the NASA Ames Balance Calibration Laboratory into account. The chosen <b>load</b> <b>schedule</b> consists of 18 load series {{with a total}} of 194 data points. It was designed to satisfy six requirements: (i) positive and negative loadings should be applied for each load component; (ii) at least three loadings should be applied between 0 % and 100 % load capacity; (iii) normal and side force loadings should be applied at the forward gage location, aft gage location, and the balance moment center; (iv) the balance should be used in "up" and "down" orientation to get positive and negative axial force loadings; (v) the constant normal and side force approaches should be used to get the rolling moment loadings; (vi) rolling moment loadings should be obtained for 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees balance orientation. In addition, three different approaches are discussed in the paper that may be used to independently estimate the natural zeros, i. e., the gage outputs of the absolute load datum of the balance. These three approaches provide gage output differences {{that can be used to}} estimate the weight of both the metric and non-metric part of the balance. Data from the calibration of a six-component force balance will be used in the final manuscript of the paper to illustrate characteristics of the proposed baseline <b>load</b> <b>schedule...</b>|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{researchers}} have proposed numerous advanced <b>load</b> <b>scheduling</b> algorithms for smart homes {{with the goal}} of reducing the grid’s peak power usage. In parallel, utilities have introduced variable rate pricing plans to incentivize residential consumers to shift more of their power usage to low-price, off-peak periods, also {{with the goal of}} reducing the grid’s peak power usage. In this pa-per, we argue that variable rate pricing plans do not incentivize consumers to adopt advanced <b>load</b> <b>scheduling</b> algorithms. While beneficial to the grid, these algorithms do not significantly lower a consumer’s electric bill. To address the problem, we propose flat-power pricing, which directly incentivizes consumers to flat-ten their own demand profile, rather than shift as much of their power usage as possible to low-cost, off-peak periods. Since most loads have only limited <b>scheduling</b> freedom, <b>load</b> <b>scheduling</b> algo-rithms often cannot shift much, if any, power usage to low-cost, off-peak periods, which are often many hours in the future. In con-trast, flat-power pricing encourages consumers to shift power usage even over short time intervals to flatten demand. We evaluate the benefits of advanced <b>load</b> <b>scheduling</b> algorithms using flat-power pricing, showing that consumers save up to 40 % on their electric bill, compared with 11 % using an existing time-of-use rate plan...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} joint {{energy storage}} management and <b>load</b> <b>scheduling</b> at a residential site with integrated renewable generation. Assuming unknown arbitrary dynamics of renewable source, loads, and electricity price, {{we aim at}} optimizing the <b>load</b> <b>scheduling</b> and energy storage control simultaneously {{in order to minimize}} the overall system cost within a finite time period. Besides incorporating battery operational constraints and costs, we model each individual load task by its requested power intensity and service durations, as well as the maximum and average delay requirements. To tackle this finite time horizon stochastic problem, we propose a real-time scheduling and storage control solution by applying a sequence of modification and transformation to employ Lyapunov optimization that otherwise is not directly applicable. With our proposed algorithm, we show that the joint <b>load</b> <b>scheduling</b> and energy storage control can in fact be separated and sequentially determined. Furthermore, both scheduling and energy control decisions have closed-form solutions for simple implementation. Through analysis, we show that our proposed real-time algorithm has a bounded performance guarantee from the optimal T-slot look-ahead solution and is asymptotically equivalent to it as the battery capacity and time period goes to infinity. The effectiveness of joint <b>load</b> <b>scheduling</b> and energy storage control by our proposed algorithm is demonstrated through simulation as compared with alternative algorithms.

This way, the effect on the scheduling of dispatchable generators and energy storage systems can be analyzed with respect to price-elastic loads. The results for a test power system and a benchmark microgrid show that as the demand is more elastic, the longer it takes for the dispatch to converge to a final condition.

In this work, we describe and evaluate a robust topology for applications that operate on a spanning tree overlay network.

40|$|Independent {{calibration}} {{variables for}} {{the characterization of}} semispan and canard wind tunnel balances are discussed. It is shown that the variable selection for a semispan balance {{is determined by the}} location of the resultant normal and axial forces that act on the balance. These two forces are the first and second calibration variable. The pitching moment becomes the third calibration variable after the normal and axial forces are shifted to the pitch axis of the balance. Two geometric distances, i. e., the rolling and yawing moment arms, are the fourth and fifth calibration variable. They are traditionally substituted by corresponding moments to simplify the use of calibration data during a wind tunnel test. A canard balance is related to a semispan balance. It also only measures loads on one half of a lifting surface. However, the axial force and yawing moment are of no interest to users of a canard balance. Therefore, its calibration variable set is reduced to the normal force, pitching moment, and rolling moment. The combined load diagrams of the rolling and yawing moment for a semispan balance are discussed.

This permits near real-time {{control of all}} of the core spacecraft systems by ground personnel. However, as NASA missions move beyond LEO, light-time communication delay issues, such as time lag and low bandwidth, will prohibit this type of operation. As missions become more distant, autonomous control of manned spacecraft will be required. The focus of this paper is the power subsystem. For present missions, controllers on the ground develop a complete schedule of power usage for all spacecraft components. This paper presents work currently underway at NASA to develop an architecture for an autonomous spacecraft, and focuses on the development of communication between the Mission Manager and the Autonomous Power Controller.

40|$|In an {{abstract}} framework, we examine how a tradeoff between efficiency and risk arises in different dynamic oligopolistic markets. We consider a scenario {{where there is}} a reliable resource provider and agents which enter and exit the market following a random process. Self-interested and fully rational agents can both produce and consume the resource. They dynamically update their <b>load</b> <b>scheduling</b> decisions over a finite time horizon, under the constraint that the net resource consumption requirements are met before each individual's deadline. We first examine the system performance under the non-cooperative and cooperative market architectures, both under marginal production cost pricing of the resource. The statistics of the stationary aggregate demand processes induced by the two market architectures show that although the non-cooperative <b>load</b> <b>scheduling</b> scheme leads to an efficiency loss - widely known as the "price of anarchy" - the stationary distribution of the corresponding aggregate demand process has a smaller tail. This tail, which corresponds to rare and undesirable demand spikes, is important in many applications of interest. With {{a better understanding of the}} efficiency-risk tradeoff, we investigate, in a non-cooperative setup, how resource pricing can be used as a tool by the system operator to tradeoff between efficiency and risk. We further provide a convex characterization of the Pareto front of different system performance measures. The Pareto front determines the tradeoff among volatility suppression of concerned measurements in the system with <b>load</b> <b>scheduling</b> dynamics. This is the fundamental tradeoff in the sense that system performance achieved by any <b>load</b> <b>scheduling</b> strategies induced by any specific market architectures is bounded by this Pareto front. by Qingqing Huang.

40|$|The use of {{divisible}} <b>load</b> <b>scheduling</b> {{theory is}} proposed to model and design grid {{systems such as}} those arising in large physics experiments. Current divisible load theory is summarized. A typical application, the STAR experiment at RHIC is discussed. This includes a sample calculation based on existing infrastructure numbers...|$|R
40|$|We present our own {{research}} work that uses extents of Peer-to-Peer technology with {{a framework that}} allows reliable Grid computing (P 2 P Grid) over the Internet. We propose how to decide optimized redundancy level of group peers by using system cost function and grid local reliability. Moreover we discuss an effectiveness of SLA-constrained <b>load</b> <b>scheduling</b> policy with multi-probing technology {{in order to maintain}} group more stable. Especially SLA-constrained <b>load</b> <b>scheduling</b> policy is designed for handling divisible loads and indivisible loads simultaneously and guaranteeing the shortest time of completing task. Finally through the simulation, we provide that these two proposed schemes can be evaluated to the reasonable solution to overcome unexpected system fault or down regarding system dependability issues in redundant group peers based P 2 P Grid environment...|$|R
