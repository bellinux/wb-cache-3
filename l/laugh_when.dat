Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad. I'll be in the way kids <b>laugh</b> <b>when</b> they're hungry and they know supper's ready, and when the people are eatin' the stuff they raise and livin' in the houses they build, I'll be there, too.|$|E
25|$|According to Liu Xiang’s book Lienü zhuan written much later, around 18 BCE, Jie was {{corrupted}} by his infatuation with his concubine Mo Xi (妺喜 or 末喜), who was beautiful, but completely lacking in virtue. Among other things, {{she liked to}} drink, enjoyed music, and also had a penchant for jugglers and sing-song girls. Apparently, she had Jie order a lake of wine made. They both sailed about in the alcohol lake in an orgy of drunken naked men and women bathing and drinking. She then commanded 3,000 men to drink the lake dry, only to <b>laugh</b> <b>when</b> they all drowned. This event was also recorded in the Han Ying’s book Han shi waizhuan.|$|E
25|$|England's start was shaky. Ian Botham was {{dismissed}} for a duck by Wasim Akram, followed by Alec Stewart, Hick and Gooch, which left England tumbling at 69/4. A solid partnership of 71 between Allan Lamb and Neil Fairbrother caused Imran {{to give an}} early second spell to his main pacer Wasim Akram in the 35th over. The decision wrote {{the fate of the}} match. Two deliveries from the left arm fast bowler dismissed Allan Lamb and Chris Lewis. Soon Fairbrother was caught by Moin Khan off Aaqib Javed to seal England's last hope. When the cards were laid down, captain Imran Khan had the last <b>laugh</b> <b>when</b> Richard Illingworth was caught by Ramiz Raja off his delivery to finish off the final and crown Pakistan world champions of cricket.|$|E
60|$|Alvina did not care. She rather liked it. She {{liked being}} déclassée. She liked feeling an outsider. At last {{she seemed to}} stand on her own ground. She laughed {{to herself as she}} went back and forth from Woodhouse to Lumley, between Manchester House and the Pleasure Palace. She <b>laughed</b> <b>when</b> she saw her father's theatre-notices {{plastered}} about. She <b>laughed</b> <b>when</b> she saw his thrilling announcements in the Woodhouse Weekly. She <b>laughed</b> <b>when</b> she knew that all the Woodhouse youths recognized her, and looked on her as one of their inferior entertainers. She was off the map: and she liked it.|$|R

500|$|The {{risks of}} her {{profession}} were illustrated when on October 1833 she barely avoided {{being killed by}} a landslide that buried her black-and-white terrier, Tray, her constant companion when she went collecting. She wrote to a friend, Charlotte Murchison, in November of that year: [...] "Perhaps you will <b>laugh</b> <b>when</b> I say that {{the death of my}} old faithful dog has quite upset me, the cliff that fell upon him and killed him in a moment before my eyes, and close to my feet ... it was but a moment between me and the same fate." ...|$|E
500|$|Sherman was {{respected}} {{among his}} fellow Republicans for his intelligence and hard work, {{but there were}} always doubts about his potential as a national candidate. As one author described him, Sherman was [...] "thin as a rail, over six feet high, with close cropped beard and possessed of bad teeth and a divine <b>laugh,</b> <b>when</b> he laughs". His public speeches were adequate and informative, but never [...] "of a sort to arouse a warm feeling for John Sherman, the man." [...] Unlike Blaine or Conkling, Sherman [...] "communicated no colorful personality, no magnetic current". His nickname, [...] "the Ohio Icicle," [...] deserved or not, hindered his presidential ambitions.|$|E
500|$|The {{show was}} {{directed}} and edited (along with Pile) by Tristram Shapeero and Dominic Brigstocke. Sketches were sped up or slowed down to create comic effect, often using body language to create humour. Editing {{was also used}} due {{to the amount of}} corpsing that occurred during the filming of the show. Tamsin Greig was said to corpse frequently, and episodes were written to minimise the contact between the characters of Caroline Todd and Alan Statham because Greig found it difficult not to <b>laugh</b> <b>when</b> acting alongside Mark Heap. The music, which plays prominently in the show, was written by Jonathan Whitehead (under the name [...] "Trellis") and won him an RTS Craft & Design Award.|$|E

500|$|According to Ibn Ishaq's {{biography}} of Muhammad, {{one woman who}} had thrown a millstone from the battlements during the siege and killed one of the Muslim besiegers, was also beheaded along with the men. 'Ã'isha, one of Mohammad's wives, is cited as describing the woman as laughing and chatting with her during the massacre, down to the moment her name was called out: 'By Allah,' she said,' that is me.' I said to her 'You poor soul, what is to happen to you?' She said:"I must be killed." [...] "Why?" [...] I asked her. [...] "For something I did," [...] she answered. She went away and was beheaded. By Allah,('Ã'isha adds) I shall never forget her cheerfulness and her great <b>laugh</b> <b>when</b> {{she knew that she}} was to be killed.' ...|$|E
500|$|The GameCube and Wii {{versions}} feature several minor {{differences in}} their controls. The Wii version of the game makes use of the motion sensors and built-in speaker of the Wii Remote. The speaker emits {{the sounds of a}} bowstring when shooting an arrow, Midna's <b>laugh</b> <b>when</b> she gives advice to Link, and the series' trademark [...] "chime" [...] when discovering secrets. The player controls Link's sword by swinging the Wii Remote. Other attacks are triggered using similar gestures with the Nunchuk. Unique to the GameCube version is the ability for the player to control the camera freely, without entering a special [...] "lookaround" [...] mode required by the Wii; however, in the GameCube version, only two of Link's secondary weapons can be equipped at a time, as opposed to four in the Wii version.|$|E
500|$|Weird Tales {{is widely}} collected, and many issues command very high prices. [...] In 2008, Mike Ashley {{estimated}} {{the first issue}} to be worth £3,000 in excellent condition, and added that the second issue is much rarer and commands higher prices. [...] Issues with stories by Lovecraft or Howard are very highly sought-after, with the October 1923 issue, containing [...] "Dagon", Lovecraft's first appearance in Weird Tales, fetching comparable prices to the first two issues. [...] The first few volumes are so rare that very few academic collections {{have more than a}} handful of these issues: Eastern New Mexico University, the holder of a remarkably complete early science fiction archive, has [...] "only a few scattered issues" [...] from the early years, and the librarian recorded in 1983 that [...] "dealers <b>laugh</b> <b>when</b> Eastern enquires about these".|$|E

500|$|Ryo {{found it}} {{difficult}} at first to write [...] "tenderhearted" [...] lyrics for songs meant to be sung by young women. When describing the lyrics for his songs using Hatsune Miku as the vocalist, Ryo felt that writing without hesitation based on his initial ideas with minimal editing was best, because the singer, as a computer program, would not feel embarrassed about singing the lyrics. He admitted that his friends would <b>laugh</b> <b>when</b> he played the songs, but he thought that [...] "if a 16-year-old girl {{is supposed to be}} singing...it is best if she sings about romance." [...] When writing lyrics for human singers, Ryo takes more care in writing lyrics that singers would not be embarrassed to sing. When Ryo receives an offer to compose theme music, he writes lyrics that tie in with the theme and mood of the given work, such as the ending themes [...] "Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari" [...] for the anime Bakemonogatari, and [...] "Hoshi ga Matataku Konna Yoru ni" [...] for the visual novel Mahōtsukai no Yoru.|$|E
500|$|As Charles {{was always}} trying to find {{elements}} that were unusual in sitcoms, the episode had a scene in which Jerry dreams he is interrogated by the FBI for his illegal cable hookup, and is killed when he tries to escape. Charles recalled the dream sequence as [...] "one of the most ambiguous scenes we did [...] " [...] and felt it was very Tarantino-like. At the end of the dream Kramer holds Jerry in his arm, stating [...] "what have you done to my little cable boy?"; this scene had to be filmed multiple times, as it was hard for Seinfeld not to <b>laugh</b> <b>when</b> Richards stated the line. In audio commentary he recorded for the Seinfeld: Volume 1 DVD set, Charles noted how he established three of the episode's four storylines in one scene, in which the characters eat and talk at Monk's Cafe. [...] "The Baby Shower" [...] also {{is one of the few}} episodes of season two in which the primary storylines of all four characters come together in the final scene. In [...] "The Busboy", which had been filmed earlier, the four storylines also intersected in the final scene, but the episode aired as the final episode of season two. Charles also felt the episode defined the Kramer character more, as it is the first episode in which Kramer speaks out against the system. In addition, the episode also establishes Elaine's interest in the Kennedys, a plot element that would return later in the season four episode [...] "The Virgin".|$|E
2500|$|After {{moving to}} Hamburg in 1998, al-Shehhi helped form the Hamburg cell with Mohamed Atta and Ramzi bin al-Shibh. There, his views {{became more and}} more radical. They met {{three or four times a}} week to discuss anti-American {{feelings}} and plot possible attacks. When someone asked why he and Atta never laughed, al-Shehhi retorted, [...] "How can you <b>laugh</b> <b>when</b> people are dying in Palestine?" ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I have to <b>laugh</b> <b>when</b> {{the press}} say that LP didn't do well {{because it did}} as well as Cuts Like a Knife, but I suppose the {{perception}} was it wasn't Reckless II! Who cares? There were some songs that were slightly different than what we had written before ... some were, let's say, slightly more exploratory than we'd written in the past. Vallance was up for the songwriting challenge of not repeating Reckless." ...|$|E
2500|$|He further commented [...] "What I did, I {{wanted to}} take that to the next level. It is a video game. People {{who are going to}} say, 'hey he fucked with the movie,' that's being ridiculous. I wanted to have fun and kind of create {{something}} on my own, while sticking to the same tone and flavor of the flick. People want to <b>laugh</b> <b>when</b> they're playing a game, and I just {{wanted to take}} advantage of that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another [...] "feud" [...] {{seemed to}} be looming when, in one run of Sunday strips in 1957, Capp lampooned the comic strip Mary Worth as [...] "Mary Worm." [...] The title {{character}} was depicted as a nosy, interfering busybody. Allen Saunders, {{the creator of the}} Mary Worth strip, returned Capp's fire with the introduction of the character [...] "Hal Rapp," [...] a foul-tempered, ill-mannered, and (ironically) inebriated cartoonist, (Capp was a teetotaler). Later, it was revealed to be a collaborative hoax that Capp and his longtime pal Saunders had cooked up together. The Capp-Saunders [...] "feud" [...] fooled both editors and readers, generated plenty of free publicity for both strips—and Capp and Saunders had a good <b>laugh</b> <b>when</b> all was revealed.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the self-titled album, Adams announced a project he calls the [...] "PAX AM Single Series", with a new seven-inch release each month. Adams stated, [...] "I'm going to release a single every month until I can't do it any more." [...] The first of these releases, the 1984 EP, was released in August 2014 and is described by Adams as, [...] "pay homage to the halcyon days of the earliest releases from [...] Dischord, SST, Touch & Go and their ilk." [...] Additional singles entitled Jacksonville, Vampires, Do You <b>Laugh</b> <b>When</b> You Lie? were released in 2014 with another entitled No Shadow (featuring actor Johnny Depp, who had previously appeared on his self-titled album) in January 2015. Blue Light was released in March 2015. [...] Often selling out within minutes of being released through PAX AM's website, the singles remain available for digital download.|$|E
2500|$|Under heavy fire, the US {{infantry}} and dismounted cavalry {{crossed the border}} through the buildings and streets of Nogales, Sonora. Members of the 10th Cavalry advanced through a building in the red-light district of the Mexican border town {{where many of the}} [...] "frightened señoritas" [...] recognized them, according to First Sgt. Thomas Jordan of the 10th Cavalry. Jordan remarked, [...] "I got a <b>laugh</b> <b>when</b> one them spoke to a trooper, saying 'Sergeant Jackson! Are we all glad to see you!' But we did not have time to tarry for the soldier to alibi his acquaintanceship." [...] As the troops advanced into the city, many of these women ventured out with bedsheets marked with impromptu red crosses in an effort to rescue persons wounded in the fighting. Two of the brave women ignored their own wounds to help rescue their fellow citizens. American civilians and women helped in rescuing the wounded on the American side. One American soldier received an award from the American citizens for his actions in saving noncombatants who had been wounded, despite being wounded himself.|$|E
2500|$|Paul Ferguson was {{the drummer}} {{in the band}} of Mataya Clifford (a.k.a. Mat Stagger) when he met Jaz Coleman (from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire) in Notting Hill, London. In October 1978, after Coleman was briefly the {{keyboard}} player in that band, he and Ferguson left to form Killing Joke. They placed an advertisement in Melody Maker which attracted guitarist Geordie Walker and bassist Martin [...] "Youth" [...] Glover. Coleman said their manifesto {{at the time was}} to [...] "define the exquisite beauty of the atomic age in terms of style, sound and form". [...] Coleman gave an explanation concerning their name: [...] "The killing joke is like when people watch something like Monty Python on the television and <b>laugh,</b> <b>when</b> really they're laughing at themselves. [...] It's like a soldier in the first world war. [...] He's in the trench, he knows his life is gone and that within the next ten minutes he's gonna be dead ... and then suddenly he realises that some cunt back in Westminster's got him sussed - 'What am I doing this for? I don't want to kill anyone, I'm just being controlled'." [...] The band played a debut gig on 4 August 1979 at Cheltenham Witcombe Lodge supporting The Ruts and The Selecter.|$|E
