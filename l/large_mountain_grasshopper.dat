30|$|We {{provided}} {{a more realistic}} rheological structure of the Martian lithosphere in this study. The next step toward understanding Martian planetary evolution is to evaluate the rheological structure beneath <b>large</b> Martian <b>mountains</b> such as Olympus.

To adequately account for the complex evolution of the Martian lithosphere, future work should re-evaluate the rheological structure beneath <b>large</b> Martian <b>mountains</b> and should test whether the calculated lithosphere could sustain <b>large</b> <b>mountains</b> such as Olympus.|$|R
