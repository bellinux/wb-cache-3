The objectives of this thesis are to determine <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> <b>curve</b> and crack pattern of RC deep beams with openings, identify the effects of opening size and shape and lastly comparing finite element analysis results with experimental results. In this thesis, two types of opening shapes were studied. The first one was circular and the other one was square. The opening sizes used were 150 x 150 mm, 200 x 200 mm and 250 x 250 mm. The structural twodimensional solid modeling of deep beams was developed using ATENA software. The finite element model of the structure was analyzed using nonlinear behaviour approach. Reinforcements used were 16 mm, 10 mm and 6 mm. Finally, crack pattern and <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> <b>curve</b> which comprises of yield load, ultimate load and deflection of beam were obtained. Location of stress concentration could be detected. From the results, similar crack pattern was observed in beams with openings, both circular and square. All beams are failed in the same manner with diagonal cracks formed at the opening corner in square opening and around the circular opening. Beams failed in shear mode. As the opening size increases, beam capacity of deep beam decreases. For solid beam, the ultimate load is 65. 09 kN. When comparing load capacity for deep beams with web openings, deep beam with 150 x 150 mm size opening has a higher ultimate load capacity compared to deep beam with the opening size of 200 x 200 mm and 250 x 250 mm. The ultimate load capacity decreases in the range of 47. 76...|$|E

40|$|The {{response}} of reinforced concrete columns under lateral load {{has always been}} an area attracting research and practical interest. The importance of columns in building frame in terms of lateral stiffness has been subjected to growing attention in relation to soft storey phenomena and other seismic response analysis over times. Various numerical approaches has been attempted to correlate deflection with lateral load according to theories and field performance. A numerical analysis has been carried out in this study on column behavior subjected to lateral load. Cantilever columns have been modeled using finite element analysis package ANSYS considering non linear stress-strain relationship of concrete and bilinear behavior of steel. Effect of lateral reinforcement in terms of confinement has also been associated. For simplicity of analysis, only rectangular columns with single story height have been considered.

Aims and objectives : The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the effect of wire diameter, lumen size and length of coil spring on the load produced as a function of displacement of SS and NiTi coil spring. Materials and methods : The study consisted of 60 samples of open and closed coil springs (30 each). Open coil springs were tested in compression and closed coil spring in tension using a Lloyd universal testing machine. The data obtained was subjected to statistical analysis using studentâ€²s t-test. Results : Mean values, standard deviation and t-value were calculated.

The three LVDTs at the bottom read almost the same displacement values, and even the two LVDTs at the top and bottom (mid-span) exhibited no clear difference. The mid-span deflection at the maximum load for the tested reinforced concrete beams with the opening is illustrated in Fig.Â  5. The <b>load</b> <b>deflections</b> of the beams tested can therefore be generalized to those of typical RC beams, which like the beams tested, fail mainly due to shear.

40|$|Analytical {{determination}} of displacements and stresses in reinforced concrete material was difficult task and engineers {{had to rely}} on empirical formulas because concrete consists of heterogeneous material and creep and shrinkage influenced deformations in it. Due to these complexities engineers in past had been facing difficulties in coping such problems, but with the advancement of digital computerization and modern numerical methods for analysis such as finite element method, these problems can be addressed in a very efficient way. There were two ways to carry out modelling in ANSYS software, one was smeared approach and the other one was discrete. In the past, Smeared approach was used to identify the cracks in RC beam using ANSYS but in this work it was extended using discrete approach of modelling and shear cracks were identified in RC beam and <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> <b>curve</b> was simulated which showed good agreement with the experimental results. Beams, made of brittle materials like concrete or cement, show increasing crack development during their service life due to mechanical and environmental loadings. This local damage can be translated into a reduction of the local bending stiffness. Stiffness modifications, while assuming constant mass distribution, can be observed by monitoring the vibration behaviour of the beam. In this paper the modal parameters of an undamaged beam are monitored and compared with the vibration behaviour of the beam subjected to controlled damaging. Selected stiffness parameters in the finite element model are adjusted {{in such a way that}} the computed modal quantities match the measured quantities. FEMtools has been used to establish a damage distribution in beams associated with increasing stress patterns. State of the art scanning laser modal equipment has been used for this purpose.

The design or selection of foam for packaging {{is done on}} the basis of impact loads to be sustained or energy to be absorbed. For transportation of nuclear material, metal foams {{can be used as a}} packaging material. It may be noted that apart from other qualification requirements, a package containing nuclear material, has to be certified for drop test. Foam can serve the purpose by providing proper cushioning. Metal foams are still under development and need to be accurately characterized in terms of their mechanical properties as well as cell morphology. The aim of this work is to develop, characterize and model foam using experiments and analysis. Aluminum foam has been developed by powder metallurgy technique and the effect of addition of varying amounts of Mg and Alumina on the strength and energy absorption has been studied. Foams of varying densities have also been developed. The reason for going for higher density is to obtain higher plateau stress. If a package is designed with lower density foam, it may become very bulky and even impractical. The characterization part of the work includes study of porosity distribution, cell wall structure, microscopy, SEM images, etc. Mechanical testing (uniaxial compression) was performed on foam samples to get <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> <b>curve</b> of foams. Area under a given curve i. e. energy absorbed per unit volume has been compared for various compositions and densities. The analysis part of the work presents effect of specimen size on bulk properties of foam. 2 D honeycomb and 3 D cases have been discussed. To model the porosities, spherical cavities have been assumed. Uniaxial compression cases with different combinations of porosities have been analyzed. The properties like Youngâ€™s modulus, plateau stress, Poissonâ€™s ratio, tangent modulus, etc. have been evaluated. The effect of variation in yield strength and tangent modulus of base material on foam has been studied. It appears that if the model is based on uniform porosity distribution, it may lead to lower bound values of physical properties and give conservative result. Although some of these trends have been observed in published literature, the current numerical study has generated additional information and insight...|$|E
40|$|Print copy is not {{available}} for this thesisLinear and nonlinear analysis of shell structures are performed using finite elements. Shell elements are formulated to capture the linear and nonlinear behavior of shell structures. Although general, the elements are specially suited for tubular joints. An automatic geometric modeling and mesh generation procedure for T, K and DT-joints is first developed. A set of shell elements are then developed and implemented in a general purpose, research oriented {{finite element analysis program}} (FEAP) to carry out linear, materially-nonlinear only, geometrically-nonlinear-only and geometric and material nonlinear analyses of thin shell structures with special emphasis on tubular joints which represent essential components of offshore platforms. A six-degree-of-freedom per node (including a true drilling degree of freedom) assembly allows easy modeling of complicated shell structures such as tubular joints or stiffened shells. The displacement interpolation is carefully chosen in order to avoid shear and membrane locking in linear and nonlinear problems. The curvature effects (initial curvature and changes in curvature due to large displacements and rotations) are incorporated by a simple modification of the flat linear shell element. This computationally very inexpensive modification increases the performance of the element by several folds. The total corotational formulation, a Lagrangian formulation, is used to treat geometric nonlinearity. Each point in the thickness of the shell is considered to be under plane stress conditions. Von Mises yield criterion with linear isotropic and kinematic hardening and the associated Prandtl-Reuss flow rule is used to model the plastic flow behavior of the shell material. The flow rule and hardening law are integrated using the return map algorithm. The robustness of the analysis tool developed is demonstrated by solving a range of linear and nonlinear problems of shell analysis. It is demonstrated through examples and comparison with known analytical or reliable numerical solutions that the elements developed are accurate in predicting both displacements and stresses. The ultimate test of the predictive ability of the analysis tool developed is performed by considering three well documented tubular joint examples (T-, K-, and DT-joints) for which experimental results in terms of <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> <b>curve</b> are available. The prediction of the collapse load and load-deflection curve for the T-joint is in excellent agreement with the experimental results.

Finally, a parametric study of tubular T-joints is conducted to study the effects of the various geometric parameters on the collapse load...|$|E
40|$|The bending {{behaviour}} of inflated beams {{has been studied}} for several decades. Several models {{have been developed to}} predict the <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> behaviour of the beams. The various models treat the problem differently, particularly in the way the wrinkling moment and collapse moment are defined. This paper relates the wrinkling threshold to a stress criterion rather than a strain criterion. An important issue with respect to the collapse load is whether to regard the material as a true membrane or as a very thin shell. It will be shown that the three thin films used in this research PC, PPS, and PEI should be regarded as thin shells. A new model that predicts the collapse moment for these kind of materials has been developed, which incorporates orthotropic material properties.

40|$|International audienceThe {{calibration}} of nonlocal models {{which contain}} an internal length {{has been among}} the major issues conditioning the implementation of this kind of failure models. Direct calibration from uniaxial testing, where the state of strain remains homogeneous throughout the specimen, is impossible. The softening law is not directly accessible because the strains cannot remain homogeneous during the entire test. In the absence of local information on the displacement field and on micro cracking in the fracture process zone, the calibration has to rely on inverse analysis. This paper presents such a procedure based on three point bend size effect tests on notched specimens. The complete <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> <b>curves</b> are used for the identification of the constitutive relations. Manual calibration is discussed first. It is emphasised that calibration on the load deflexion curve from a single experiment is not objective.

The experimental setup of a large-scale testing facility is described. Four model piles were installed in two identical cylinders filled with simulated marine sediment. Five electrically insulated electrodes were installed close to the piles to apply a high-voltage electric field in the test cylinder. Negative direct current voltages of - 20, - 30, and - 10 kV were applied in three phases, respectively, for 33 days in the treatment cylinder. Axial compression and pullout pile load tests were performed {{and the results were}} compared for both cylinders after each phase of treatment. The pile response is presented in terms of the experimental <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> <b>curves.</b> It is observed that the axial capacity was increased 30, 29, and 8 % after the first, second, and third treatment phases, respectively. The pullout capacity was increased due to the treatment by 11, 23, and 12 % after the first, second, and third treatment phases, respectively. Further development of this technique may provide potential solutions for the improvement of soft marine clays, and ultimately it could be applied in the field to rehabilitate existing offshore foundations...|$|R
40|$|Deep beams are {{typically}} used in tall buildings, transfer floors and offshore structures {{and have a}} lot of advantages which make their use the most feasible option in many situations. The building codes do not give any explicit guidance to designing this type of structure with opening. furthermore the theoretical model for concrete deep beam strength in shear compose FRP is very limited in the literature. A series of experimental tests from previous literature were carried out to investigate the behavior and performance of reinforced concrete deep beams with opening and concrete beams strengthened in shear with composite material such as steel fiber reinforced (SFR), aramid fiber reinforced polymer (AFRP), glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) and carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) and others. This current study aims as developing a 3 D finite element model of deep beam with opening and deep beam with opening strengthened in shear externally with CFRP sheets and analyzing them using explicit method in ANSYS. It will be used for modeling shear strength and comparison between them for <b>load</b> - <b>deflection</b> <b>curve.</b> The failure <b>load</b> and deformation that acquired from the 3 D finite element model will be verified against published experimental data. That comparison between the numerical and the experimental results asserted that good correlation for the <b>load</b> and <b>deflection</b> <b>curves</b> was recorded, ANSYS can predict the crack patterns which it have good agreement with those observed in experimental work. Moreover numerical simulation results were obtained stress and strain in all specimen and that cannot be easily obtained in experimental test...|$|R
40|$|In {{passenger}} vehicles {{the ability to}} absorb energy due to impact and be survivable for the occupant is called the ''crashworthiness'' of the structure. To identify and quantify the energy absorbing mechanisms in candidate automotive composite materials, test methodologies were developed for conducting progressive crush tests on composite plate specimens. The test method development and experimental set-up focused on isolating the damage modes associated with the frond formation that occurs in dynamic testing of composite tubes. Quasi-static progressive crush tests were performed on composite plates manufactured from chopped carbon fiber with an epoxy resin system using compression molding techniques. The carbon fiber was Toray T 700 and the epoxy resin was YLA RS- 35. The effect of various material and test parameters on energy absorption was evaluated by varying the following parameters during testing: fiber volume fraction, fiber length, fiber tow size, specimen width, profile radius, and profile constraint condition. It was demonstrated during testing {{that the use of}} a roller constraint directed the crushing process and the <b>load</b> <b>deflection</b> <b>curves</b> were similar to progressive crushing of tubes. Of all the parameters evaluated, the fiber length appeared to be the most critical material parameter, with shorter fibers having a higher specific energy absorption than longer fibers. The combination of material parameters that yielded the highest energy absorbing material was identified...|$|R
