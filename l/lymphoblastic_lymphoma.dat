40|$|The Fas/FasL system mediates induced {{apoptosis}} of immature thymocytes and peripheral T lymphocytes, {{but little}} is known about its implication in genetic susceptibility to T-cell malignancies. In this article, we report that the expression of FasL increases early in all mice after Î³-radiation treatments, maintaining such high levels {{for a long time in}} mice that resisted tumor induction. However, its expression is practically absent in T-cell <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>lymphomas.</b> Interestingly, there exist significant differences in the level of expression between two mice strains exhibiting extremely distinct susceptibilities that can be attributed to promoter functional polymorphisms. In addition, several functional nucleotide changes in the coding sequences of both Fas and FasL genes significantly affect their biological activity. These results lead us to propose that germ-line functional polymorphisms affecting either the levels of expression or the biological activity of both Fas and FasL genes could be contributing to the genetic risk to develop T-cell <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>lymphomas</b> and support the use of radiotherapy as an adequate procedure to choose in the treatment of T-cell malignancies.

40|$|To {{study the}} {{characteristics}} and histogenesis of the malignant lymphomas {{derived from the}} gastrointestinal mucosa, histologic and immunohistochemical analyses were performed {{on a series of}} 28 malignant lymphomas of the gastrointestinal tract. By cytomorphologic classification, there were two small lymphocytic lymphomas, one small cleaved cell lymphoma, two mixed small cleaved and large cell lymphomas, 17 large cell lymphomas, one small noncleaved cell lymphoma, three immunoblastic <b>lymphomas,</b> and two <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>lymphomas.</b> This distribution of histologic types was compatible with that of nodal lymphoma. The lymphomas with poor prognostic histology (23 cases) outnumbered those with favorable prognosis (five cases). Three of 28 cases (one in the stomach and two in the small intestine) had cytologic features consistent with centrocytoid cell lymphoma of the mucosa associated lymphoid tissue and were large cell lymphomas. Immunophenotypically, 23 cases expressed B-cell markers (82. 1 %) and three cases reacted with T-cell markers. Two cases did not react with either T-cell or B-cell markers. True histiocytic lymphomas were not identified. Gastric lymphomas (nine cases) and colorectal lymphomas (three cases) were of B-lymphocyte origin whereas T-cell lymphomas were noted in the small intestine (two cases) and ileocecal region (one case). Three cases of centrocytoid lymphoma were of B-lymphocyte origin. Histologically B-cell lineage lymphomas were evenly distributed on various histologic subtypes but all T-lineage lymphomas belonged to the large cell type. The two cases with undetermined phenotype were <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>lymphomas</b> histologically.

50|$|At least 9 {{frameshift}} {{mutations in}} theETV6 gene {{have been associated}} with ~12% of adult T cell Acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases.

40|$|Stat 5 {{proteins}} {{are critical}} signaling molecules activated by many cytokines. Within the immune system, Stat 5 plays important roles {{related to the}} development of thymocytes and proliferation of T cells. Stat 5 has been implicated in malignant transformation, and moreover, the activated tyrosine phosphorylated form of Stat 5 is frequently observed in human lymphomas. We previously demonstrated the oncogenic potential of Stat 5, with thymic <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>lymphomas</b> developing in a significant proportion of transgenic (TG) mice overexpressing Stat 5 a or Stat 5 b in lymphocytes. In addition, immunization or expression of a T-cell receptor (TCR) transgene augmented the rate of tumor formation. Here, we investigate the mechanism of Stat 5 -mediated lymphomagenesis by exploring the contributions of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) /TCR and pre-TCR signals. We present data demonstrating that Stat 5 b TG mice unexpectedly develop CD 8 + lymphoma {{even in the absence of}} either pre-TCR signaling or normal thymic selection. Indeed, acceleration of Stat 5 b transgene-mediated lymphoma occurred on TCRÎ±â/â and pre-TCRÎ±â/â backgrounds. In light of these data, we propose a model in which alterations in T-cell development at the double-negative/double-positive (DN/DP) stages cooperate with cytokine-mediated pathways in immature thymocytes to give rise to <b>lymphoblastic</b> T-cell <b>lymphomas</b> in Stat 5 b TG mice...|$|R

However, it may be useful as part of a panel to demonstrate B-cell <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>lymphoma,</b> since the malignant cells in this condition are often CD43 positive, and may be difficult to stain with other antibodies.

The enhancer sequences present within the M-MuLV long terminal repeat (LTR) region of the proviral genome {{have been shown to}} influence the disease specificity of the virus strongly. We examined the contribution of the M-MuLV enhancers to the transcriptional activity and pathogenesis of M-MuLV by constructing LTRs containing heterologous enhancer elements. The simian virus 40 enhancer region (72 - and 21 -base-pair repeats) was inserted into the U 3 region (at - 150 base pairs) of the M-MuLV LTR (Mo + SV) and also into a deleted form of the LTR which lacks the M-MuLV enhancer sequences (delta Mo + SV). These chimeric LTRs were used to generate infectious M-MuLVs by transfection of corresponding proviral plasmids into mouse fibroblasts. The relative infectivities of Mo + SV and delta Mo + SV recombinant viruses as determined by rat XC cell plaque assay and reverse transcriptase assay were 60 to 70 % of wild-type M-MuLV levels. To study the pathogenicity of these two recombinant viruses, we inoculated newborn NIH Swiss mice with either Mo + SV or delta Mo + SV M-MuLV. Both viruses induced disease more slowly than M-MuLV, which induces disease 2 to 4 months postinoculation. Mo + SV M-MuLV-inoculated animals became moribund at 3 to 13 months postinoculation, whereas delta Mo + SV M-MuLV-inoculated animals became moribund at 6 to 24 months postinoculation. The tumors induced by the two viruses were characterized histologically and molecularly. Mo + SV M-MuLV-induced tumors were primarily T-cell-derived <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>lymphomas</b> containing extensive rearrangements of the T-cell receptor beta gene. In contrast, delta Mo + SV M-MuLV induced pre-B- and B-cell <b>lymphoblastic</b> <b>lymphomas,</b> B-cell-derived follicular-center cell lymphomas, and acute myeloid leukemia. The delta Mo + SV tumor DNAs from B-lineage tumors were typically rearranged at the immunoglobulin gene loci and contained germ line configurations of the T-cell receptor beta gene.
