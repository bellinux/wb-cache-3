25|$|In RTOG {{clinical}} trial 0129, {{in which all}} patients with advanced disease received radiation and chemotherapy, a retrospective analysis (recursive-partitioning analysis, or RPA) at three years identified three risk groups for survival (<b>low,</b> <b>intermediate,</b> and high) based on HPV status, smoking, T stage and N stage (see Ang et al., Fig. 2). HPV status was the major determinant of survival, followed by smoking history and stage. 64% were HPV+ and all were in the low and intermediate risk group, with all non-smoking HPV+ patients in the low risk group. 82% of the HPV+ patients were alive at three years compared to 57% of the HPV- patients, a 58% reduction {{in the risk of}} death. Locoregional failure is also lower in HPV+, being 14% compared to 35% for HPV-. HPV positivity confers a 50–60% lower risk of disease progression and death, but the use of tobacco is an independently negative prognostic factor. A pooled analysis of HPV+OPC and HPV-OPC patients with disease progression in RTOG trials 0129 and 0522 showed that although less HPV+OPC experienced disease progression (23 v. 40%), the median time to disease progression following treatment was similar (8 months). The majority (65%) of recurrences in both groups occurred within the first year after treatment and were locoregional. HPV+ did not reduce the rate of metastases (about 45% of patients experiencing progression), which are predominantly to the lungs (70%), although some studies have reported a lower rate. with 3-year distant recurrence rates of about 10% for patients treated with primary radiation or chemoradiation. Even if recurrence or metastases occur, HPV positivity still confers an advantage.|$|E
500|$|Biologic {{and genetic}} {{characteristics}} have been identified, which, when added to classic clinical staging, has allowed patient assignment to risk groups for planning treatment intensity. These criteria include {{the age of}} the patient, extent of disease spread, microscopic appearance, and genetic features including DNA ploidy and N-myc oncogene amplification (N-myc regulates microRNAs), into <b>low,</b> <b>intermediate,</b> and high risk disease. A recent biology study (COG ANBL00B1) analyzed 2687 neuroblastoma patients and the spectrum of risk assignment was determined: 37% of neuroblastoma cases are low risk, 18% are intermediate risk, and 45% are high risk.

2500|$|The cancer {{outcomes}} (local control, regional control, and survival) for transoral resection {{followed by}} adjuvant therapy {{are comparable to}} primary chemoradiation, so that treatment decisions depend more on treatment-related morbidity, functional outcome, and quality of life.

Patient preference is equally important.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the advantages and}} disadvantages of the new low-addition (add) (+ 3. 00 diopter [D]) ReSTOR multifocal IOL compared with the preceding ReSTOR model with + 4. 00 D add. SETTING: University Eye Hospital, Tuebingen, Germany. DESIGN: Comparative case series. METHODS: Patients with a + 3. 00 D or + 4. 00 D add multifocal IOL were examined for uncorrected and distance-corrected visual acuity at distance, intermediate, and near. A defocus profile was assessed, individual reading distance and the distance for <b>lowest</b> <b>intermediate</b> visual acuity were determined. Patient satisfaction was evaluated with a standardized questionnaire. Contrast sensitivity was tested under mesopic and photopic conditions. RESULTS: Uncorrected and distance-corrected intermediate visual acuities were statistically significantly better in the + 3. 00 D add group (24 eyes) than in the + 4. 00 D add group (30 eyes); distance and near visual acuities were not different between groups. The defocus profile significantly varied between groups. The + 4. 00 D add group had a closer reading distance (33. 0 cm) than the + 3. 00 D add group (43. 5 cm), a closer point of <b>lowest</b> <b>intermediate</b> visual acuity (65. 8 cm versus 86. 9 cm) and worse <b>lowest</b> <b>intermediate</b> visual acuity (20 / 59 +/- 4. 5 letters [SD] versus 20 / 48 +/- 5. 5 letters). Thus, patients in the + 3. 00 D add group reported being more satisfied with intermediate visual acuity. The + 3. 00 D add group reported more glare but less halos than the + 4. 00 D add group; contrast sensitivity was not different. CONCLUSION: The lower addition resulted in a narrower defocus profile, a farther reading distance, and better intermediate visual acuity and thus increased patient satisfaction.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} the diagnostic accuracy of CT coronary angiography (CTCA) in women at <b>low</b> to <b>intermediate</b> pre-test probability of {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD) compared with men. METHODS: In this retrospective study we included symptomatic patients with <b>low</b> to <b>intermediate</b> risk who underwent both invasive coronary angiography and CTCA. Exclusion criteria were previous revascularisation or myocardial infarction. The pre-test probability of CAD was estimated using the Duke risk score. Thresholds of less than 30 % and 30 - 90 % were used for determining <b>low</b> and <b>intermediate</b> risk, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of CTCA in detecting obstructive CAD (≥ 50 % lumen diameter narrowing) was calculated on patient level. P[*]<[*] 0. 05 was considered significant. RESULTS: A total of 570 patients (46 % women [262 / 570]) were included and stratified as low (women 73 % [80 / 109]) and intermediate risk (women 39 % [182 / 461]). Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV {{were not significantly different}} in and between women and men at <b>low</b> and <b>intermediate</b> risk. For women vs. men at low risk they were 97 % vs. 100 %, 79 % vs. 90 %, 80 % vs. 80 % and 97 % vs. 100 %, respectively. For intermediate risk they were 99 % vs. 99 %, 72 % vs. 83 %, 88 % vs. 93 % and 98 % vs. 99 %, respectively. CONCLUSION: CTCA has similar diagnostic accuracy in women and men at <b>low</b> and <b>intermediate</b> risk...|$|R

40|$|SummaryObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this review was to compare the {{mortality}} rates for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) -seropositive renal transplant (RT) patients versus HBsAg-seropositive persons of the general population. MethodsA comprehensive search was performed to identify cohort studies of HBsAg-seropositive RT patients with at least 4 years of follow-up. Data were analyzed as outlined below. HCC was a rare event in regions of <b>low</b> and <b>intermediate</b> seroprevalence of HBsAg. Subsequently, studies from <b>low</b> and <b>intermediate</b> seroprevalence areas were analyzed separately from those of high seroprevalence areas. ResultsThirty-one retrospective studies that followed 1277 seropositive RT patients were identified for inclusion. The studies were pooled and compared to four different general population studies that included 12558 seropositive persons using Poisson methods. The mortality rate of HCC was increased in <b>low</b> and <b>intermediate</b> seroprevalence areas (RR 7. 67, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 3. 93 – 15. 0; RR 9. 92, 95 % CI 5. 38 – 18. 3). In high seroprevalence areas, the mortality rate of HCC was increased compared to one population study, but not another (RR 2. 76, 95 % CI 1. 64 – 4. 63; RR 1. 02, 95 % CI 0. 61 – 1. 69). ConclusionsMortality due to HCC was increased in <b>low</b> and <b>intermediate</b> seroprevalence areas, but the evidence was inconclusive for high seroprevalence areas...|$|R
