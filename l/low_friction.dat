5|$|Reducing {{friction}} {{is vital}} for minimizing wear on mechanical components and preventing overheating. As the relative speed of the components rises, and as the contact force between them increases, the importance of friction mitigation increases. Various types of bearing and/or lubricant {{may be used to}} reduce friction at the interface between two components. In biological joints such as the human knee, friction is reduced by means of cartilage with a very <b>low</b> <b>friction</b> coefficient, as well as lubricating synovial fluid, which has very low viscosity. Gerhard Scholtz of Humboldt University of Berlin asserts that a similar secreted lubricant or dead cellular material could allow a biological wheel to rotate freely.|$|E

25|$|Bioceramic {{prosthetics}} {{are made}} of aluminium oxide (Al2O3). Aluminium oxide is a ceramic biomaterial {{that has been used}} for more than 35 years in the orthopedic and dental ﬁelds for a variety of prosthetic applications because of its <b>low</b> <b>friction,</b> durability, stability, and inertness.|$|E
25|$|Many {{thermoplastic}} {{materials such as}} nylon, HDPE and PTFE are commonly used in <b>low</b> <b>friction</b> bearings. They are especially useful because the coefficient of friction falls with increasing imposed load.

40|$|The {{friction}} and wear of oxide-ceramics sliding against the nickel base alloy IN- 718 at 25 to 800 C were measured. The oxide materials tested were mullite (3 Al 2 O 3. 2 SiO 2); lithium aluminum silicate (LiAlSi(x) O(y)); polycrystalline monolithic alpha alumina (alpha-Al 2 O 3); single crystal alpha-Al 2 O 3 (sapphire); zirconia (ZrO 2); and silicon carbide (SiC) whisker-reinforced Al 2 O 3 composites.

25|$|High-end, {{chrome plated}} steel dildos {{are also popular}} in the BDSM scene. Some users prefer them because of their hardness, firmness, durability, {{electrical}} conductance (see erotic electrostimulation), and <b>low</b> <b>friction,</b> especially when {{used in conjunction with}} lubricant.

25|$|The modern total hip {{replacement}} was pioneered by Sir John Charnley, expert in tribology at Wrightington Hospital, England in the 1960s. He found that joint surfaces could {{be replaced by}} implants cemented to the bone. His design consisted of a stainless steel one-piece femoral stem and head and a polyethylene, acetabular component, {{both of which were}} fixed to the bone using PMMA (acrylic) bone cement. For over two decades, the Charnley <b>Low</b> <b>Friction</b> Arthroplasty and its derivative designs were the most-used systems in the world. This formed the basis for all modern hip implants.|$|E

50|$|Fluid {{bearings}} {{generally have}} very low friction—far better than mechanical bearings. One source of friction in a fluid bearing is the viscosity of the fluid. Hydrostatic gas bearings {{are among the}} <b>lowest</b> <b>friction</b> bearings.

25|$|An older Sachs {{drum brake}} kit ("Hydro Pull") allows {{to rebuild a}} regular Sachs bicycle drum brake to {{hydraulic}} lever and action. A piston is added outside the drum instead of the bowden clamp. This solution is often seen on modified Long John cargo bikes, allowing a <b>low</b> <b>friction</b> lever pull front wheel brake action. After Sachs ceased production of this kit a similar solution is sometimes done by welding on a Magura piston to the drum cylinder lever. Welding was necessary because the Magura action is reverse {{to that of the}} Sachs kit.|$|E
25|$|A {{magnetic}} rod is required when constructing a compass. This {{can be created}} by aligning an iron or steel rod with Earth's magnetic field and then tempering or striking it. However, this method produces only a weak magnet so other methods are preferred. For example, a magnetised rod can be created by repeatedly rubbing an iron rod with a magnetic lodestone. This magnetised rod (or magnetic needle) is then placed on a <b>low</b> <b>friction</b> surface {{to allow it to}} freely pivot to align itself with the magnetic field. It is then labeled so the user can distinguish the north-pointing from the south-pointing end; in modern convention the north end is typically marked in some way.|$|E
25|$|Railway {{signalling}} is {{a system}} used to control railway traffic safely to prevent trains from colliding. Being guided by fixed rails which generate <b>low</b> <b>friction,</b> trains are uniquely susceptible to collision since they frequently operate at speeds that do not enable them to stop quickly or within the driver's sighting distance; road vehicles, which encounter {{a higher level of}} friction between their rubber tyres and the road surface, have much shorter braking distances. Most forms of train control involve movement authority being passed from those responsible for each section of a rail network to the train crew. Not all methods require the use of signals, and some systems are specific to single track railways.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two classes}} of {{non-toxic}} anti-fouling coatings. The most common class relies on <b>low</b> <b>friction</b> and low surface energies. Low surface energies result in hydrophobic surfaces. These coatings create a smooth surface which can prevent attachment of larger microorganisms. For example, fluoropolymers and silicone coatings are commonly used. These coatings are ecologically inert but have problems with mechanical strength and long-term stability. Specifically, after days biofilms (slime) can coat the surfaces which buries the chemical activity and allows microorganisms to attach. The current standard for these coatings is polydimethylsiloxane, or PDMS, which consists of a non-polar backbone made of repeating units of silicon and oxygen atoms. The non-polarity of PDMS allows for biomolecules to readily adsorb to its surface in order to lower interfacial energy. However, PDMS also has a low modulus of elasticity that allows {{for the release of}} fouling organisms at speeds of greater than 20 knots. The dependence of effectiveness on vessel speed prevents use of PDMS on slow-moving ships or those that spend significant amounts of time in port.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAlumina-titania {{coatings}} {{produced by}} plasma spray processes {{are being developed}} {{for a wide variety}} of applications that require resistance to wear, erosion, cracking and spallation. Consideration of parameters setting will develop reliable coatings with high performance properties for demanding coating application. Al 2 O 3 3 %wt TiO 2 coating was produced onto metal substrate using Praxair Plasma Spray System with SG- 100 Gun. This paper discusses the experimental and testing performance analysis of the coating which prepared based on three varied process parameters (current, powder flow rate and stand-off-distance). With the varied coating parameters, test results showed that increasing current from 550 A to 650 A and powder flow rate from 22. 5 g/min to 26 g/min increased the performance of mechanical properties of coating (adhesion strength & hardness) and gave the <b>lowest</b> <b>friction</b> coefficient value (i. e. best wear resistance) of coating. Increasing stand-off-distance from 75 mm to 90 mm also increased hardness performance and provided the <b>lowest</b> <b>friction</b> coefficient value of coating. However increasing stand-off-distance has decreased adhesion strength at setting powder flow rate of 26 g/min and 650 A current. The behavior of such parameters setting significantly influenced the production of optimum Al 2 O 3 3 %wt TiO 2 coating onto metal substrate...|$|R

2500|$|The {{replacement}} joint, {{which was}} known as the <b>Low</b> <b>Friction</b> Arthroplasty, was lubricated with synovial fluid. The small femoral head (...) was chosen for Charnley's belief that it would have lower friction against the acetabular component and thus wear out the acetabulum more slowly. Unfortunately, the smaller head dislocated more easily. Alternative designs with larger heads such as the Mueller prosthesis were proposed. Stability was improved, but acetabular wear and subsequent failure rates were increased with these designs. The Teflon acetabular components of Charnley's early designs failed within a year or two of implantation. This prompted a search for a more suitable material. A German salesman showed a polyethylene gear sample to Charnley's machinist, sparking the idea to use this material for the acetabular component. The ultra high molecular weight polyethylene or UHMWPE acetabular component was introduced in 1962. Charnley's other major contribution was to use polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement to attach the two components to the bone. For over two decades, the Charnley <b>Low</b> <b>Friction</b> Arthroplasty, and derivative designs were the most used systems in the world. It formed the basis for all modern hip implants.|$|E

40|$|Unidirectional sliding {{experiments}} with polished and laser textured steel surfaces {{were carried out}} to investigate the effects of different textured area densities, aspect ratios and dimple arrangements. The system was lubricated with Polyalphaolefin (PAO) at 100 °C and the contact pressure was 3 MPa. For measuring Stribeck curves, the sliding speed was controlled between 40 and 2000 mm/s. The textured area density was varied between 5 % and 30 %, with the <b>lowest</b> <b>friction</b> values found for 10 %. Aspect ratios ranging from 0. 02 to 0. 2 were investigated and for 0. 1 the <b>lowest</b> <b>friction</b> values were measured. The dimple arrangements tested were cubic, hexagonal and a random distribution for a textured area density of 10 % and an aspect ratio of 0. 1. Our results demonstrate that the dimple arrangement does affect friction values, hinting {{to the fact that}} individual texture elements do influence each other. The optimum dimple arrangement was found in a hexagonal packing. This systematic variation of these three key texturing parameters for the morphological texturing of a tribological surface with dimples will allow a strategic choice of texturing parameters. This makes the most of the tremendous potential that laser surface texturing has for reducing friction forces and thereby CO 2 emissions...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{influence}} of archwire material (NiTi, beta-Ti and stainless steel) and brackets design (self-ligating and conventional) on the frictional force resistance. Material and Methods: Two types of brackets (self-ligating brackets - Smartclip, 3 M/Unitek - and conventional brackets - Gemini, 3 M/Unitek) with three (0, 5, and 10 degrees) slot angulation attached with elastomeric ligatures (TP Orthodontics) were tested. All brackets were tested with archwire 0. 019 "x 0. 025 " nickel-titanium, beta-titanium, and stainless steel (Unitek/ 3 M). The mechanical testing was performed with a universal testing machine eMIC DL 10000 (eMIC Co, Brazil). The wires were pulled from the bracket slots at a cross-head speed of 3 mm/min until 2 mm displacement. Results: Self-ligating brackets produced significantly lower friction values {{compared with those of}} conventional brackets. Frictional force resistance values were directly proportional to the increase in the bracket/ wire angulation. With regard to conventional brackets, stainless steel wires had the <b>lowest</b> <b>friction</b> force values, followed by nickel-titanium and beta-titanium ones. With regard to self-ligating brackets, the nickel-titanium wires had the <b>lowest</b> <b>friction</b> values, significantly lower than those of other materials. Conclusion: even at different angulations, the self-ligating brackets showed significantly lower friction force values than the conventional brackets. Combined with nickel-titanium wires, the self-ligating brackets exhibit much lower friction, possibly due to the contact between nickel-titanium clips and wires of the same material...|$|R
