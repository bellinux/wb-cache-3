40|$|This article {{states that}} during the {{construction}} of industrial buildings {{it is necessary to}} provide engineering communications (including systems of supply and <b>exhaust</b> <b>ventilation)</b> which ensure uninterrupted production, its technological and environmental safety.

As for devices for removing highly disperse non-sticky dust, it is possible to offer vortex dust collectors, the efficiency of which depends on the design and operating mode. A method is proposed to increase the efficiency of a vortex dust collector, {{to improve the quality of}} the purified air, and to reduce energy consumption during air purification by installing watering nozzles in primary and secondary air pipes made in the form of a Venturi tube. In consequence of multidirectional movement of dust particles and sprayed water, active coagulation of dust particles takes place, as a result of which the separation increases. Apart from that, watering dusty air flows leads to the formation of a liquid film on the inner surface of the separation chamber, which prevents dust particles from rebounding off the separation chamber and facilitates their capture and flushing into the collecting hoppe...|$|R
50|$|Ventilation {{systems can}} be local or general. <b>Local</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>ventilation</b> {{operates}} {{at or near the}} source of contamination, often in conjunction with an enclosure. Examples of local exhaust systems include fume hoods, gloveboxes, biosafety cabinets, and vented balance enclosures. Exhaust hoods lacking an enclosure are less preferable, and laminar flow hoods are not recommended because they direct air outwards towards the worker. General exhaust ventilation operates on an entire room through a building's HVAC system. It is inefficient and costly as compared to <b>local</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>ventilation,</b> and should not be relied upon for controlling exposure, although it can provide negative room pressure to prevent contaminants from exiting the room.

50|$|Ventilation System: A {{system of}} local and/or general exhaust is {{recommended}} to keep employee exposures {{as low as}} possible. <b>Local</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>ventilation</b> is generally preferred because it can control the emissions of the contaminant at its source, preventing dispersion of it into the general work area. Please refer to the ACGIH document, Industrial Ventilation, A Manual of Recommended Practices, most recent edition, for details. Personal Respirators (NIOSH Approved): For conditions of use where exposure to dust or mist is apparent and engineering controls are not feasible, a particulate respirator (NIOSH type N95 or better filters) may be worn. If oil particles (e.g. lubricants, cutting fluids, glycerine, etc.) are present, use a NIOSH type R or P filter. For emergencies or instances where the exposure levels are not known, use a full-face positive-pressure, air-supplied respirator.Skin Protection: Not required.Eye Protection: Not required.

50|$|Welding is {{the most}} {{important}} factor in ship building and should be performed by qualified welders in order to protect the ship structure. It is achieved by heating the surfaces to the point of melting using oxy-acetylene, electric arc, or other means, and uniting them by pressing, hammering, etc. But in shipyards, there are times when the welder has to crawl into a confined space and weld. Welding can produce toxic fumes such as Nitric Oxide, Nitrogen Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide, Phosgene, Hydrogen Fluoride, Carbon Dioxide can also result in serious damage to human health or death if ventilation is not present. A case study was performed to see where would be most effective place to exhaust the hull cells on the bulkhead in between two spaces using an air horn versus air with an electric blower. They used welders who were employees of the shipyard and asked them to weld in a specific space. One that had shipyard dilution ventilation(DV) and the other had local exhaust ventilation(LEV) then recorded to see which typed of ventilation worked the best.

Effective kitchen <b>exhaust</b> <b>ventilation</b> can reduce exposure to cooking-related air pollutants as an enabling step to healthier, low-energy homes. This report identifies barriers to the widespread adoption of kitchen <b>exhaust</b> <b>ventilation</b> technologies and practice and proposes a suite of strategies to overcome these barriers.
