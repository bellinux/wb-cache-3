A Plackett-Burman design, {{followed by a}} complete second order design {{was used for the}} screening of most important factors and to maximize the pectin <b>liase</b> (PMGL) activity, respectively. The maximum PMGL activity by P. brasilianum achieved was 9. 0 U/mL after 48 h of cultivation in a medium containing pectin (33. 0 g/L), yeast extract (30. 0 g/L) and potassium phosphate (2. 0 g/L) at 30 ºC, with a stirring rate of 180 rpm, initial pH 5. 5 and 5 x 106 spores/mL inoculum size. The kinetic evaluation in terms of substrate consumption demonstrated that the maximum production of PMGL was at 72 h, and 40 % of the total organic carbon, 25 % of the nitrogen, 88 % of the magnesium, 13 % of the potassium and 66 % of the iron were consumed. The pH remained almost stable during the whole period of production (5. 33 to 4. 9).

40|$|Growth and enzymes {{production}} by Aspergillus flavipes FP- 500 were evaluated on pectin, polygalacturonic acid, galacturonic acid, arabinose, rhamnose, xylose, glycerol and glucose at different initial pH values. We {{found that the}} strain produced exopectinases, endopectinases and pectin lyases. Exopectinases and pectin lyase {{were found to be}} produced at basal levels as constitutive enzymes and their production was modulated by the available carbon source and pH of culture medium and stimulated by the presence of inducer in the culture medium. Endo-pectinase was basically inducible and was only produced when pectin was used as carbon source. Our results suggest that pectinases in A. flavipes FP- 500 are produced in a concerted way. The first enzyme to be produced was exopectinase followed by Pectin Lyase and Endo-pectinase. Avaliou-se o crescimento e a produção de enzimas por Aspergillus flavipes FP- 500 em pectina, ácido poligalacturônico, ácido galacturônico, arabinose, ramnose, xilose, glicerol e glicose, em diferentes valores de pH inicial. Verificamos que a cepa produziu exopectinases, endopectinases e pectina liases. Exopectinases e pectina liases foram produzidas em níveis basais como enzimas constitutivas e sua produção foi modulada pela fonte de carbono disponível e pelo pH do meio de cultura e estimulada pela presença de indutores no meio de cultura. Endopectinase foi indutível e produzida somente quando pectina foi utilizada como fonte de carbono.

40|$|Despite over {{a century}} of {{exploitation}} of fish in European waters, scientists know surprisingly little about the precise distribution of the major commercially exploited fish species, and their habitat requirements. This is the first European study that aims to identify essential fish habitats of commercially important fish species (cod, haddock, whiting, plaice, sole, plaice, lemon sole) in the Irish Sea and the English Channel (UK). Areas of the seabed that harbour the highest densities of these species were identified and mapped using an existing database spanning 12 years ’ data from national stock assessments. Demersal fishers observe samples from the sea floor every time they haul their nets, which far exceed the sampling schemes that scientists can afford or mobilise. Experienced fishers may have decades of observations to bring to bear and keep detailed records of exactly where and when they fish {{and how much they}} catch. Although the ultimate goal of fishing is to provide income from the catch, rather than to test scientific hypotheses, many fishers seek to understand the very questions about the seabed that motivate our study. Therefore, we decided to <b>liase</b> with the fishing industry to refine our broad scale fish maps for future survey. Information was gathered in a pilot study through questionnaires filled in at a fishing exhibition. Through a process of informal presentations and meetings, fishermen have helped us to refine our studies by pinpointing fishing grounds of importance for the fish species in question. The co-operation with fishers has not only added to the credibility of the study and any management decisions that may depend on its findings, but has also highlighted once more the vast amount of knowledge that can be gained from this declining species...|$|E
40|$|Thesis: An {{integrated}} model of service delivery, combined with community partnerships for provision of childcare, focused training related to specific employer needs, {{and other resources}} indirectly related to return to employment, provide {{a system that is}} most effective and humanizing in assisting individuals to find meaningful employment. Summary: I. A number of factors have contributed to dehumanizing of Welfare Clients. Recent deep cuts to welfare amounts have left individuals without adequate funds for housing and food. Services divided between many agencies require clients to navigate a maze of places, people and paperwork. Agencies limited to one or two services must turn over large numbers of clients to provide revenue for survival, lessening their ability to provide relationship and stability to clients. II. An {{integrated model}}, such as the one Pathways Skill Development and Placement Centre is using, can provide full service from assessment to employment. Clients begin with common assessment and job search skills training, including interview skills and resume creation. Community Placement can offer short-term experience for skill and confidence development. Employment Placement can then <b>liase</b> with employers and clients and create fit between the two. Job mentors monitor and coach for long-term job maintenance. III. Partnerships between the Service Agency and other community agencies will be established to overcome other barriers. Childcare, specific job skills training identified with area employers, computer skills and similar resources will be drawn on, with case management continually handled by the service agency IV. Such a model provides an interactive, holistic, and client centred approach to the Welfare to Work system. It maintains client dignity and integrity, builds a support system that is stable, and contains the elements that build the independence and self-sufficiency of the client without becoming overwhelming. ...|$|E

Here I would especially like to acknowledge the work of Sarah Lowe, who left us recently. She worked for ISSG for over 5 years and saw it grow from an embryonic organisation to its current state. Sarah was the first coordinator of the ISSG network and was instrumental in its growth and development. Among many other things, she ran the membership network, edited the first copies of Aliens, and helped to draft the first version of the IUCN lnvasives Guidelines. More recently she successfully managed the production of the prototype global database of invasive species for the Global Invasive Species Programme (GISP), still based in the ISSG office. Sarah is a multi-skilled person and we are lucky to have held onto her for so long! She is now embarking on a course ofpostgraduate study in marine biology at the University of North Queensland. She will remain in close contact with ISSG, but we will miss her greatly and wish her all the best for her future as a marine biologist. Following Sarah's departure, Michael Browne has stepped in as our database manager and has hit the ground running, with recent trips to Cape Town (South Africa) to help report on database developments (see below) and Europe to <b>liase</b> with the Species Information Service o~the SSC. Other recent changes within ISSG are the formal appointment of three Regional Section Leaders. These are Dr Faith Campbell (North America), Dr Piero Genovesi (Europe) and Dr Nirmalie Pallewatta (South Asia). These people will provide focus and leadership for ISSG. activities in their region.

40|$|The present {{short-term}} {{study is}} {{a survey of the}} effect of Army support services on satisfaction with Army life as experienced by partners of service personnel and their subsequent willingness to remain within the military enclave. It aimed to elicit the personal perspective of partners on deployment issues, the efficacy of current Army support services, and attitudes to continuing an association with the Army. Participants were recruited from the families of those soldiers who had returned from peacekeeping deployments between January to July 2000. New Zealand Army Administration staff supplied a list of 317 addresses. Of these, 291 partners could be contacted by mail and subsequently 184 individuals returned a completed 16 -page New Zealand Partner Support Survey (2000) questionnaire. This questionnaire elicited data about: socio-demographic characteristics; perceived support; Army support services; general issues; potential deployment problems; general health (GHQ- 30); parenting issues and anecdotal narratives. Using quantitative methods the data was analyzed with an additional aim to collect data for a future longitudinal study on the retention of Army personnel. The participants' anecdotal narratives showed that deployments do impact the family and that family factors such as attitudes to Army lifestyle and support services do influence the soldiers' decision to remain in service. The study revealed that partners tend to mainly expect support from the Army with what they perceive is an Army related problem. These issues primarily concerned communication links with deployed partners and dissemination of information regarding soldiers. Based on this evidence it is suggested that the Army consolidate current support services to establish positions of full-time, dedicated Information Officers. The main responsibility of this position would be to <b>liase</b> between the soldiers' families and the Army. From this short-term study it is apparent that the decision to remain in service can be influenced by the Army's demonstration that the soldiers' families are valued members of the Military community. The provision of a quality support service specifically tailored {{to meet the needs of}} those it purports to serve is tangible evidence of this regard...|$|E
40|$|Waste minimisation clubs (WMCs) {{have been}} a major focus within the UK for the {{importation}} of sustainable waste management into, mainly, industry and commerce. Waste Strategy 2000 —waste strategy for England and Wales—lays out the context for club contribution to national strategy. Waste production {{can be seen as a}} result of inefficiencies in production and management processes and this happens in many companies because of a knowledge gap. The role of Envirowise—UK Best Practice programme, specialising in clean technology and waste minimisation—is highlighted as a major contributor to driving sustainable waste management in business, partly through WMCs. Early WMC development (1992 onwards) was based upon preceding developments from mainland Europe. Various models for club structure have emerged and these include; Demonstration, Facilitated Self-Help and Sectoral. Access to funding for WMCs is a key limiting factor for their formation, many recent WMCs had been funded by the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme (LTCS). The Government stated, during December 2002, that the LTCS had made a number of marked contributions to sustainable practice, however, it considered there was little evidence that it had delivered a step change; so Object C/CC would no longer be funded under the LTCS. From 2003 onwards, the UK lost the major funding source for sustainable waste management research and development, including new and novel approaches to industrial/commercial WMC development. A model is proposed to reverse the decline in WMC development; a key step forward would be the formation of an Envirowise led forum along with industry, service providers, higher education and waste minimisation champions of proven worth. The forum would produce an Action Plan based upon the English regions; a similar approach could also be used with the Devolved Assemblies of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Each Region would be allocated a provisional fund, by Central Government, to sponsor Envirowise appointed waste minimisation champions, who would <b>liase</b> with the Regional Development Agency and other Regional bodies to produce an Action Plan for WMC development, based on a Facilitated Self-Help model. This way, a wide range of local expertise and support will be recruited to the formation and management of WMCs, decreasing costs and increasing income leverag...|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} post-harvest {{fisheries}} in Indonesia was undertaken for the Overseas Development Administration, by a fisheries technologist, a biologist, and an economist, during a five week visit in June and July 1988. The {{terms of reference}} were: to review post-harvest fisheries and donors' activities in the sector, and to identify a strategy for future ODA inputs. The marine fishery {{is the most important}} in terms of value, followed by tambak aquaculture (mostly shrimps and milkfish), and the inland capture fishery. Most of the harvest is sold in the domestic market as wet fish, dried fish, and pindang (fish cooked in brine). Exports of frozen shrimp, from the tambaks and the marine fishery, are becoming increasingly important. Additionally, there are exports of wet fish on ice to Singapore. The team considered that the greatest problem facing the sector is overfishing of the South Java Sea, resulting in operational fishing grounds being located at an ever increasing distance from the main markets on Java. This poses a challenge to resource management, both pre- and post-harvest. The former requiring resource surveys, and the latter, the identification of low-cost improvements to on-board handling, to ensure the supply of fish to Java's predominantly low income population. A study encompassing these aspects is proposed by the EC in collaboration with France; ODNRI, in consultation with ODA HO, will <b>liase</b> with the French technical agency (ORSTOM) to determine whether complementary inputs from ODNRI would be useful. A second area in which action is proposed is in reducing losses from insect infestation of sun-dried fish. Dried fish is an important protein source for low-income groups in Indonesia, and an area in which ODA could make an effective contribution. The use of household insecticides on drying fish in Indonesia has been widely publicised and the practice banned. The problem persists though, and the team recommends a follow-up programme to an existing project. The existing project has provided training to the staff of provincial quality control laboratories in loss assessment and reduction, including the use of a safe (and approved) insecticide - Minawet. Financial analysis of the use of Minawet and adoption trials will be undertaken during the final stages of the existing project. Subject to satisfactory results from these, a large-scale extension project is proposed, aimed at adoption of Minawet by fish processors. An additional element will be the provision of the necessary training and equipment in pesticide residue analysis, for the National Centre for Quality Control and Fish Processing...|$|E
40|$|Resistance {{induction}} {{through the}} use of chemical inducers often results in physiological costs to the plant. In this study, induced resistance in cotton plants was evaluated with regard to physiological costs in a cultivar susceptible to Colletotrichum gossypii var. cephalosporioides (CNPA GO 2002 - 7997). Plants were cultivated in substrates with two levels of nitrogen and received two applications of acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM), jasmonic acid (JA) and Agro-Mos® (AM) disease resistance inducers. Plant height (H), internodal length (IL), shoot fresh weight (SFW), root fresh weight (RFW), shoot dry weight (SDW) and root dry weight (RDW) were evaluated. The activity of the phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and peroxidase (POX) was also determined. The plants treated with ASM presented high physiological costs with an accentuated reduction in H, SFW and SDW, whereas those treated with JA exhibited a significant increase in SDW, and did not significantly differ from H and IL. In the potting mix supplemented with nitrogen, all inducers differed from the control treatment regarding to internodal length, whereas only ASM and AM presented a significant difference between one another in the potting mix without the addition of nitrogen. Significant correlations (P= 0. 05) were found for most of the variables analyzed, with greater correlations observed between SFW and SDW (0. 94); IL and H (0. 74); SFW and H (0. 70); and SDW and H (0. 70). ASM induced the least amount of PAL activity, significantly differing from the remaining treatments. Greater POX activity was observed in ASM, which significantly differed from the control. AM and JA, however, presented lower activity than the control with regard to these enzymes, and {{it was not possible to}} confirm induction resistance in these two treatments. A indução de resistência pelo uso de indutores químicos tem resultado algumas vezes em custo fisiológico para a planta. A resistência induzida em algodoeiro foi avaliada quanto ao custo fisiológico em uma linhagem suscetível a Colletotrichum gossypii var. cephalosporioides (CNPA GO 2002 - 7997) que foi cultivada em substratos com dois níveis de nitrogênio e receberam duas aplicações dos indutores acibenzolar-S-metil (ASM), ácido jasmônico (AJ) e Agro-Mós® (AM). As plantas foram avaliadas quanto à altura (AP), comprimento de internódio (CI), biomassa fresca da parte aérea (BFPA), biomassa fresca da raiz (BFR), biomassa seca da parte aérea (BSPA) e biomassa seca da raiz (BSR). Também foi determinada a atividade das enzimas fenilalanina amônia <b>liase</b> (PAL) e peroxidase. As plantas tratadas com ASM apresentaram alto custo fisiológico com acentuada redução na AP, BFPA e BSPA, enquanto as tratadas com AJ mostraram aumento significativo na BSPA, além de não diferirem significativamente na AP e CI. No substrato suplementado com nitrogênio, todos os indutores diferiram da testemunha quanto ao comprimento de internódio, apesar de não diferirem entre si, enquanto no substrato sem adição de nitrogênio apenas ASM e AM apresentaram diferença significativa entre si.

As castanhas do clone BRS 189 foram semeadas em bandejas de plÃstico contendo vermiculita umedecida com Ãgua destilada (tratamento controle) ou soluÃÃes de NaCl com condutividades elÃtricas de 6, 0, 12, 0 e 18, 0 dS. m- 1 (tratamentos salinos), as quais foram mantidas em casa de vegetaÃÃo. No decorrer do experimento, foram coletadas cinco plÃntulas por bandeja, Ã medida que estas alcanÃavam os estÃdios de desenvolvimento (ED) 2 (emersÃo da radÃcula), 4 (emergÃncia do solo) e 8 (plÃntula estabelecida), as quais foram divididas nas suas partes constituintes (cotilÃdones e eixo embrionÃrio), tendo-se o ED 0 (castanha quiescente) como referÃncia. Avaliaram-se os efeitos da salinidade sobre as plÃntulas de cajueiro anÃo-precoce atravÃs de medidas da massa seca dos cotilÃdones e eixo embrionÃrio e da quantificaÃÃo dos teores de lipÃdios, proteÃnas totais e amido nos cotilÃdones e de carboidratos solÃveis (redutores e nÃo-redutores), aminoÃcidos livres e dos Ãons Na+, K+ e Cl- nos cotilÃdones e eixo embrionÃrio. AlÃm disso, avaliou-se a atividade das principais enzimas envolvidas na mobilizaÃÃo de reservas lipÃdicas (lipase, <b>liase</b> do isocitrato e sintase do malato) e amilÃceas (sintase do amido, &# 945;+&# 946;-amilase e fosforilase do amido) nos cotilÃdones de plÃntulas crescidas em condiÃÃes controle e em 18, 0 dS. m- 1. A maior taxa de depleÃÃo dos cotilÃdones ocorreu entre o ED 4 e o ED 8, simultaneamente Ã fase mais intensa de crescimento do eixo embrionÃrio. Todavia, esses processos foram inibidos pela salinidade, principalmente nas plÃntulas crescidas a 18, 0 dS. m- 1. A mobilizaÃÃo das reservas lipÃdicas e protÃicas dos cotilÃdones tornou-se evidente apÃs a emersÃo da radÃcula (ED 2), sendo mais pronunciada entre o ED 4 e o ED 8, porÃm, nessas plÃntulas, esse processo foi severamente inibido, na proporÃÃo em que a concentraÃÃo de sais do meio aumentou. Nas plÃntulas do controle, houve um aumento nos teores de aminoÃcidos livres dos cotilÃdones entre o ED 0 e o ED 2, seguido por um decrÃscimo entre o ED 2 e o ED 8, mas o mesmo nÃo aconteceu nas plÃntulas submetidas a 12, 0 e 18, 0 dS. m- 1, em que ocorreu inibiÃÃo do transporte dos aminoÃcidos para o eixo embrionÃrio. Houve um acÃmulo transiente de amido nos cotilÃdones durante o estabelecimento da plÃntula de cajueiro anÃo-precoce, que foi severamente inibido pela salinidade, especialmente nas plÃntulas crescidas a 18, 0 dS. m- 1. Os teores de carboidratos solÃveis nos cotilÃdones foram ditados pela sua utilizaÃÃo (fraÃÃo nÃo-redutora) na etapa de germinaÃÃo (entre o ED 0 a ED 2), pela sua produÃÃo a partir da mobilizaÃÃo lipÃdica (fraÃÃo nÃo-redutora) e amilÃcea (fraÃÃo redutora) e pelo seu transporte para o eixo embrionÃrio (fraÃÃo nÃo-redutora). Entretanto, a salinidade afetou esses processos, causando reduÃÃo nos teores de carboidratos redutores nas plÃntulas no ED 8 e inibindo o transporte dos carboidratos nÃo-redutores para o eixo embrionÃrio. Adicionalmente, os teores de aminoÃcidos livres e carboidratos solÃveis do eixo embrionÃrio tambÃm aumentaram ao longo do estabelecimento da plÃntula, mas este aumento foi severamente inibido pela salinidade, principalmente nas plÃntulas submetidas a 18, 0 dS. m- 1. Os teores dos Ãons tÃxicos (Na+ e Cl-) nos cotilÃdones e no eixo embrionÃrio aumentaram consideravelmente com a salinidade, enquanto os de K+ foram reduzidos. Os maiores valores da atividade lipÃsica, assim como das enzimas <b>liase</b> do isocitrato, sintase do malato e (&# 945;+&# 946;) -amilase foram encontrados nos cotilÃdones das plÃntulas no ED 8, que correspondeu ao ED em que a mobilizaÃÃo lipÃdica e amilÃcea foi mais pronunciada, mas, dentre estas, apenas as atividades lipÃsica e amilÃsica foram inibidas pela salinidade. A sintase do amido, por sua vez, esteve mais ativa no ED 4, em concomitÃncia Ã etapa de acÃmulo do amido nos cotilÃdones, sendo fortemente inibida pela salinidade nesse mesmo ED. JÃ a atividade da fosforilase do amido decresceu progressivamente entre o ED 0 e o ED 4, mas aumentou entre o ED 4 e o ED 8. A anÃlise em conjunto destes resultados permite concluir que a etapa de estabelecimento da plÃntula (entre o ED 2 e o ED 4) Ã mais sensÃvel Ã salinidade do que a de germinaÃÃo (entre o ED 0 e o ED 2). AlÃm do mais, os efeitos iÃnicos da salinidade pareceram mediar a inibiÃÃo da mobilizaÃÃo das reservas cotiledonares e a reduÃÃo do dreno exercido pelo eixo embrionÃrio sobre os cotilÃdones, resultando na reduÃÃo do crescimento da plÃntula de cajueiro anÃo-precoceThis study {{aimed to}} obtain basic {{information}} on seed germination and seedling establishment of dwarf-precocious cashew (Anacardium occidentale L.) under saline {{conditions and the}} relationship between salinity and reserve mobilization during these processes. BRS 189 seeds (cashew nuts) were sown in plastic trays containing vermiculite moistened with distilled water (control) or NaCl solutions with electrical conductivities of 6. 0, 12. 0 and 18. 0 dS m- 1 (saline treatments), which were kept in a greenhouse. During the experiment, were harvested five seedlings (cotyledons and embryonic axis) per tray, when they reached the followed developmental stages (DS) : quiescent seed (0 DS), radicle protrusion (2 DS), seedling emergence (4 DS) and seedling established (8 DS). Salinity effects on the dwarf-precocious cashew seedlings were evaluated by cotyledons and embryonic axis dry mass, determination of lipids, protein and starch contents in cotyledons and determination of soluble carbohydrates (reducing and non-reducing), free amino acids, Na+, K+ and Cl- contents in cotyledons and embryonic axis. We also evaluated the enzymes involved in the lipid (lipase, isocitrate lyase and malate synthase) and starch (starch synthase, &# 945;+&# 946;-amylase and starch phosphorylase) mobilization in cotyledons of seedlings grown under control and 18. 0 dS m- 1 conditions. In cotyledons, the highest depletion rate occurred between 4 and 8 DS, which corresponded the most intense growth phase of the embryonic axis. However, these processes were inhibited by salinity, especially in the seedlings grown at 18. 0 dS m- 1. In cotyledons, lipid and protein mobilization became evident after the radicle protrusion (2 DS), being more pronounced between 4 and 8 DS. On the other hand, for these seedlings, this process was strongly inhibited, with the salt concentration increase. In control seedlings, there was an increase in free amino acids contents of cotyledons between 0 and 2 DS, followed by a decrease between 2 and 8 DS. It has not been observed in seedlings subjected to 12. 0 and 18. 0 dS m- 1, in which there was an inhibition of amino acids transport to the embryonic axis. In addition, a starch transient accumulation occurred in the cotyledons, during the dwarf-precocious cashew seedling establishment, which was strongly inhibited by salinity, especially in the seedlings grown at 18. 0 dS m- 1. The soluble carbohydrates contents in cotyledons were influenced by their use (fraction of non-reductive) in the germination (between DS 0 and DS 2), their production from lipid (non-reducing fraction) and starch (reducing fraction) mobilization and their transport to the embryonic axis (non-reducing fraction). However, these processes were affected by salinity, causing a reduction in reducing carbohydrates contents in 8 DS seedlings and inhibiting the non-reducing carbohydrates transport to embryonic axis. Additionally, the free amino acids and soluble carbohydrates contents also increased in embryonic axis during the seedling establishment, but this increase was strongly inhibited by salinity, especially in the seedlings subjected to 18. 0 dS m- 1. The toxic ions (Na+ and Cl-) concentration in cotyledons and embryonic axis increased significantly with salinity, whereas K+ content was reduced. The highest lipase, isocitrate lyase, malate synthase and (&# 945;+&# 946;) -amylase activities were observed in cotyledons 8 DS seedlings, which corresponded to the DS with more intense lipid and starch mobilization, among these enzymes, only the lipase and amylase were inhibited by salinity. The starch synthase activity was most intense at 4 DS, simultaneously to the starch accumulation in the cotyledons, being strongly inhibited by salinity in this period. The starch phosphorylase activity decreased progressively between 0 DS and 4 DS, but increased between 4 DS and 8 DS. These results show that seedling establishment (between 2 DS and 4 DS) is more sensitive to salinity than seed germination (between DS 0 and DS 2). Moreover, the salinity ionic effect seems to mediate the cotyledonary reserve mobilization inhibition and it reduced embryonic axis sink on the cotyledons, which negatively affect dwarf-precocious cashew seedlings growt...|$|E

Para isso realizaram-se os seguintes tratamentos: UV-C a 3, 7 kJ m- 2; 1 -metilciclopropeno (1 -MCP) a 2 ppm; e 1 -MCP + UV-C. Desses tratamentos, observou-se que ocorreu redu????o na firmeza dos frutos n??o-tratados e tratados com UV-C ?? medida que a matura????o avan??ou, acompanhado do ac??mulo de transcritos do gene que codifica para a enzima poligalacturonase (PG), indicando que o tratamento UV-C n??o contribui para a preserva????o desse atributo de qualidade. Por outro lado, o 1 -MCP participou na preserva????o da firmeza de polpa, mesmo tendo havido ac??mulo de transcritos da PG, sugerindo n??o ser esse gene o respons??vel maior por essa propriedade. A radia????o UV-C promoveu incremento no teor de etileno, e mesmo assim houve retardo no desenvolvimento da colora????o nos frutos submetidos a esse tratamento. Como esperado, frutos tratados com 1 -MCP apresentaram retardo no pico da produ????o de etileno, no desenvolvimento de colora????o e na diminui????o da firmeza de polpa. O teor de licopeno foi menor nos frutos submetidos ao tratamento com 1 -MCP. No entanto, nos frutos que foram submetidos ao tratamento com 1 -MCP + UV-C, o teor de &# 946;-caroteno foi significativamente {{superior}} no epicarpo dos frutos, o que lhes conferiu uma colora????o alaranjada. O ??cido p-hidroxibenz??ico foi o composto fen??lico predominante encontrado no epicarpo e mesocarpo dos frutos, e a quercetina apresentou maiores teores nos frutos submetidos ao tratamento com 1 -MCP + UV-C. &# 948;-tocoferol foi o ??nico tocoferol identificado nos frutos de tomate, o qual apresentou elevados teores no epicarpo dos frutos. Os genes que codificam para as enzimas respons??veis pela s??ntese de caroten??ides fitoeno sintase (PSY) e &# 948;-caroteno desaturase (ZCD); pela s??ntese de fenilpropan??ides, fenilalanina am??nia <b>liase</b> (PAL) e chalcona sintase (CHS); enzimas antioxidantes, catalase (CAT) e super??xido dismutase (SOD) apresentaram alto ac??mulo de transcritos inicialmente no epicarpo e posteriormente no mesocarpo dos frutos submetidos ?? radia????o UV-C. De modo geral, a radia????o UV-C estimulou a produ????o de etileno, e mesmo assim reduziu a velocidade de matura????o, especialmente no que tange ?? altera????o de colora????o. A firmeza de polpa n??o foi afetada pelo tratamento com UV-C. As respostas moleculares ?? aplica????o da radia????o UV-C iniciam no epicarpo e, em seguida, s??o observadas no mesocarpo. UV-C {{radiation is}} utilized in postharvest of fruits {{with the objective}} of reducing inoculum and disease incidence. However, it is possible that it acts as an abiotic stressor agent, activating defense mechanisms of plant tissues, which is characterized by the induction of secondary metabolism, especially through the synthesis of phenolics compounds and carotenoids, involved in the protection of oxidative stress. In this context, molecular changes derived from the action of UV-C radiation were evaluated in tomato, during storage (20 - 23 ??C), and its relationship with biochemical and physiological responses and with events influenced by the plant hormone ethylene. For such, the following treatments were performed: UV-C at 3, 7 kJ m- 2; 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP) at 2 ppm, and 1 -MCP + UV-C. From these treatments it was observed that a reduction in fruit firmness occurred in untreated and UV-C treated fruit as maturation advanced, accompanied by the accumulation transcripts of a gene encoding the enzyme polygalacturonase (PG), indicating that UV-C treatment did not contribute for the maintenance of this quality attribute. On the other hand, 1 -MCP participated in the maintenance of flesh firmness, even though PG transcript accumulation was found, suggesting this gene is not the primary responsible for this property. UV-C radiation induced an increase in ethylene content, but still, a delay in fruit color development occurred in fruit from this treatment. As expected, 1 -MCP treated fruit showed a delayed peak of ethylene production, of the color development, and of decrease in flesh firmness. Lycopene content was lower in fruit subjected to 1 -MCP treatment. However, in fruit treated with 1 -MCP + UV-C, &# 946;-carotene content was significantly higher in the exocarp of the fruit, which conferred them an orange color. p-Hydroxybenzoic acid was the predominant phenolic compound found in exocarp and mesocarp, and quercetin was found in higher content in fruits subjected to 1 -MCP + UV-C treatment. &# 948;-tocopherol was the only tocopherol identified in tomato fruit, present in high levels in the exocarp of the fruit. Genes coding for enzymes responsible for synthesis of carotenoids, phytoene synthase (PHS) and &# 948;-carotene desaturase (ZCD) for the synthesis of phenylpropanoids, phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and chalcone synthase (CHS), antioxidant enzymes, catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) showed initially high accumulation of transcripts in the exocarp and later in the mesocarp of fruit subjected to UV-C radiation. In general, UV-C radiation induced ethylene production, and yet slowed down maturation, particularly regarding color changes. Flesh firmness was not affected by UV-C treatment. Molecular responses to UV-C radiation application started in the exocarp and were in sequence found in the mesocarp...|$|E
40|$|O feijÃo-de-corda [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp. ] tem grande importÃncia socioeconÃmica no Nordeste brasileiro. Entretanto, sua produÃÃo Ã baixa devida a diversos fatores abiÃticos e biÃticos. Dentre os fatÃres biÃticos, o vÃrus do mosaico severo do caupi (CPSMV, famÃlia Secoviridae) apresenta grande destaque, por causar a virose que mais acomete essa cultura no paÃs. Embora existam cultivares resistentes ao vÃrus, nÃo se sabe quais os mecanismos de defesa envolvidos. Por essa razÃo, foi elaborado um estudo comparativo entre cultivares resistentes e susceptÃveis, utilizando duas abordagens experimentais. Na abordagem bioquÃmica, possÃveis diferenÃas de atividades de enzimas relacionadas ao estresse oxidativo (dismutase do superÃxido, {{peroxidase}} do ascorbato, peroxidase) e Ã patogÃnese (&# 946;- 1, 3 -glucanase e quitinase), alÃm da fenilamÃnia <b>liase,</b> e teores de H 2 O 2 foram estudadas nos cultivares PitiÃba (susceptÃvel) e Macaibo (resistente). ApÃs tratamento com o CPSMV ou com apenas carborundum (plantas controles), foram realizadas coletas nos tempos de 6, 12, 24, 48 e 72 h, tendo sido realizadas as anÃlises bioquÃmicas nos extratos protÃicos obtidos das folhas secundÃrias. Foi verificado que, de maneira geral, a resposta entre os cultivares nÃo diferiram significamente, sugerindo que os mecanismos de defesa de feijÃo-de-corda sejam diferentes da resposta clÃssica de defesa. Na segunda abordagem, molecular, as sequÃncias nucleotÃdicas dos genes codificantes para os fatores de iniciaÃÃo de traduÃÃo (eIF 4 E, eIF(iso) 4 E, eIF 4 G, eIF(iso) 4 G e nCBP) e as sequÃncias primÃrias putativas das proteÃnas correspondentes foram analisados, no intuito de se averiguar a existÃncia de padrÃes de polimorfismos entre cultivares resistentes e susceptÃveis, que pudessem estar relacionados Ã defesa constitutiva conferida por genes recessivos. ApÃs anÃlise das sequÃncias, foi observado que eIF 4 E apresentava polimorfismos entre os cultivares, sendo que, em pelo menos duas posiÃÃes nas sequÃncias primÃrias putativas do fator (68 e 108), existiram diferenÃas entre cultivares susceptÃveis e resistentes (Arg 68 /Pro 68; Val 108 ou Pro 108 /Ala 108). A modelagem molecular revelou que as diferenÃas em aminoÃcidos situam-se em dois loops externos, prÃximos ao domÃnio de ligaÃÃo ao capacete (m 7 G), bastante relatados em casos de resistÃncia recessiva para a famÃlia Potyviridae. AtravÃs de estudos de imunodectecÃÃo posterior ao passo cromatogrÃfico em coluna de afinidade, foi observado que as mudanÃas de aminoÃcidos nÃo comprometiam, a capacidade de eIF 4 E em se ligar ao m 7 G in vitro. Entretanto, como foram observadas duas variantes para eIF 4 E, entre cultivares resistentes e susceptÃveis ao CPSMV, em regiÃes prÃximas espacialmente, nÃo se pode descartar a hipÃtese de que a resistÃncia recessiva constitutiva esteja associada com essas mutaÃÃes detectadas nessas sequÃncias, que iriam modificar, consequentemente, a interaÃÃo da VPg viral com eIF 4 E in vivo. Cowpea [(Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) ] {{has a major}} socioeconomic {{importance in}} Northeastern Brazil. However, its production is low due abiotic and biotic factors. Amongst the biotic factors the cowpea severe mosaic virus (CPSMV, Secoviridae family) has a great importance because it causes the most prevalent and serious virus disease that affects this crop in the country. Although there are resistant cultivars to CPSMV, the defense mechanisms involved is not understood. For this reason, a comparative study was conducted between resistant and susceptible cultivars, using two experimental approaches. In the first one, the biochemical approach, possible differences of enzyme activities related to oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, guaiacol peroxidase) and pathogenesis (&# 946;- 1, 3 -glucanase and chitinase), in addition of phenyl amonium lyase, and H 2 O 2 generation in {{the leaves of the}} cultivars PitÃuba (susceptible) and Macaibo (resistant) were analyzed. The secondary leaves were harvested at 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 h after treatment with CPSMV or carborundum (controls) and these above parameters were measures in the protein extracts obtained. It was shown that, in general, the response amongst the cultivars did not differ significantly, suggesting that the defense mechanisms of cowpea are different from the classic response of defense observed for several plant species. In the second approach, molecular, the nucleotide sequences of the genes that code for the translation initiation factors (eIF 4 E, eIF(iso) 4 E, eIF 4 G, eIF(iso) 4 G and nCBP) and the primary strucuture of the correspondent putative proteins were analyzed in order to search patterns of polymorphis between the studied cowpea cultivars that could be related to a constitutive defense conferred by recessive genes. After sequence analysis, it was found that eIF 4 E showed polymorphisms between cultivars, and, in at least two positions (68 and 108), there were differences between susceptible and resistant cultivars (Arg 68 /Pro 68; Val 108 or Pro 108 /Ala 108). The molecular modeling revealed that differences in amino acid are located in two external loops close to the cap (m 7 G) binding domain, well reported in cases of recessive resistance within the Potyviridae family. Through immunodetection studies with the leaf extracts and the protein fractions obtained after the affinity chromatography on a Sepharose- 7 -metil-guanosina column, {{it was found that the}} amino acid mutations found did not impair the ability of eIF 4 E to bind to M 7 G in vitro. However, as it was observed two variants for eIF 4 E comparing the resistant and susceptible cultivars to CPSMV, at spatially neighboring regions, it could not be ruled out the hypothesis that this constitutive/recessive resistant trait is correlated with these mutations detected, which could impair, consequently, the in vivo interaction of eIF 4 E with the viral VPg...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MScAgric) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2003. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Cellulose {{is by far}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} carbohydrate available from plant biomass. These biopolymers are therefore an important renewable source of food, fuels and chemicals. Cellulose is embedded in a matrix of hemicellulose, lignin and pectin and is composed of repeating glucose units linked by p- 1, 4 -glycosidic bonds. The individual molecules are held together by hydrogen bonds, forming largely crystalline fibres. The hemicellulose, which is a low molecular weight heteropolysaccharide, coats and binds the cellulose microfibrils, preventing the cellulose from becoming too crystalline. Three predominant types of hemicelluloses are recognised, namely 1, 3 - and 1, 4 -p-D-galactans, 1, 4 -p-D-mannans and 1, 4 -p-D-xylans, which are named according to the sugar type that forms the polymer backbone. Pectic substances contain rhamnogalacturonan backbones in which 1, 4 -linked a-D-galacturonan chains are interrupted at intervals with a-L-rhamnopyranosyl residues carrying neutral side chains. Two groups of enzymes, cellulases and pectinases, are required for the microbial utilisation of crystalline cellulose and pectin. Cellulases are multicomponent complexes that are often composed of endoglucanases, exoglucanases and cellobiases. Cellobiose is the major end product of concerted endoglucanase and exoglucanase activity. Cellobiose is then hydrolysed to glucose by p-glucosidases. The enzymatic breakdown of pectic polymers occurs by the deesterifying action of the saponifying enzymes, pectinesterase, releasing the methyl groups of the pectin molecule, and by hydrolase or lyase action of the depolymerases (pectin lyase, pectate lyase and polygalacturonase), splitting the a- 1. 4 -glycosidic linkages in the polygalacturonate chain. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used extensively in the alcoholic beverage industry for fermentations of wine, beer and other alcoholic beverages for many years. However, it is unable to produce extracellular depolymerising enzymes that can efficiently degrade polysaccharides, which are the main cause of clarification and filtration problems. Enzyme preparations have been used in the alcoholic beverage industries to degrade haze-forming polysaccharides, thereby improving the filterability and quality of products such as beer and wine. An alternative would be to develop S. cerevisiae strains that produce extracellular polysaccharidases, enabling the yeast to degrade polysaccharides without the addition of commercial enzyme preparations. These strains can also be very useful in improving the quality of wine, as well as cutting the costs of the winemaking process. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of two transformed S. cerevisiae strains on different wine grape varieties. The following genes have been cloned and characterised previously: the Aspergillus niger endo-p-xylanase gene (xynC), the Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens endo-| 3 - 1. 4 -glucanase gene (endl), the Erwinia chrysanthemi pectate lyase gene (pelE) and the Erwinia carotovora polygalacturonase gene (p e h l). The yeast alcohol dehydrogenase I gene promoter (ADH 1 p), the alcohol dehydrogenase II gene terminator (ADH 2 j), the tryptophan synthase gene terminator (TRP 5 r) and the yeast mating-type pheromone a-factor secretion signal sequence (MFcrfs) were used to compile the following gene constructs: ADH 1 p-MFa 1 s-end 1 -TRP 5 r (designated END 1), A DH 1 p-xyn C-A DH 2 T (designated XYN 4), ADH 1 p-MFa 1 s-peh 1 -TRP 5 t (designated PEH 1) and ADH 1 p-MFa 1 s-pelE-TRP 5 r (designated PELE). Two yeast integrating plasmids were constructed, one containing the END 1 and XYN 4 gene cassettes and the other containing the PEH 1 -PELE cassette. These two plasmids were then integrated into the URA 3 locus of two separate industrial wine yeast strains of S. cerevisiae. To facilitate selection of the industrial yeast transformants in the absence of auxotrophic markers, the integrating plasmid containing the END 1 and XYN 4 gene cassettes was issued with the dominant selectable Geneticin G 418 -resistance G f) marker. The integrating plasmid harbouring the PEH 1 -PELE gene cassette was issued with the dominant selectable sulphumetronmethyl resistance (SMR 1) marker. The introduction of these plasmids into commercial wine yeast strains directed the synthesis of END 1, XYN 4, PELE and PEFI 1 transcripts and the production of extracellular biologically active endo-P- 1, 4 - glucanase, endo-(3 -xylanase, pectate lyase and polygalacturonase. These recombinant yeasts were capable of extracting more colour from grape skins of certain varieties, as well as leading to more freeflow wine as a result of the more effective degradation of glucans, xylans and pectins in the skins. They also led to decreased turbidity in the wine, making it more filterable. Future work will entail further investigation of the effects of these recombinant yeasts on different white and red wine grape varieties. Another objective of this study was to screen non-Saccharomyces wine yeasts for the production of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes. The reason for this part of the thesis was to determine the types of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes that are produced and to determine which genera produce which kinds of extracellular enzymes. A total of 237 yeast isolates, belonging to the genera Kloeckera, Candida, Debaryomyces, Rhodotorula, Pichia, Zygosaccharomyces, Hanseniaspora and Kluyveromyces, were screened for the production of extracellular pectinases, proteases, (3 -glucanases, lichenases, p-glucosidases, cellulases, xylanases, amylases and sulphite reductase activity. These yeasts were all isolated from grapes and clarified grape juice to ensure that they were yeasts found in must during the initial stages of fermentation. This information can be used to pave the way to pinpoint the specific effects in wine of these enzymes produced by the so-called wild yeasts associated with grape must. This information can also be used to transform Saccharomyces wine yeasts with some of the genes from these non-Saccharomyces yeasts for the production of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes. However, future research will have to be done to determine the extent of the activity of these enzymes in wine fermentations and to obtain better knowledge of the physiological and metabolical features of non-Saccharomyces yeasts. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Sellulose is verreweg die volopste koolhidraat in plantbiomassa. Hierdie biopolimere is dus ‘n baie belangrike hernubare bron van voedsel, brandstof en chemikaliee. Sellulose is in 'n matriks van hemisellulose, lignien en pektien gebed en is uit herhaalde glukose eenhede, wat deur middel van (3 - 1, 4 -glukosidiese bindings geheg is, saamgestel. Die individuele molekules word deur waterstofbindings aan mekaar geheg, wat aanleiding gee tot die vorming van kristallyne vesels. Die hemisellulose, wat 'n lae molekulere gewig heteropolisakkaried is, bedek en bind die sellulose vesels en verhoed daarmee die vorming van vesels wat te kristallyn is. Drie predominante tipes hemisellulose word herken en sluit 1, 3 - en 1, 4 -p-D-galaktane, 1, 4 -p-D-mannane en 1, 4 -p-D-xylane in, wat vernoem word volgens die suikereenhede wat die polimeerruggraat vorm. Pektiene bestaan uit 'n rhamnogalakturonaanruggraat waarin 1, 4 -gekoppelde a-D-galakturonaankettings periodiek met a-L-rhamnopiranosiel residue, bevattende neutrale sykettings, onderbreek word. Twee groepe ensieme, nl. pektinase en sellulase, word deur mikrobes vir die benutting van kristallyne pektinase en sellulase vereis. Sellulase is multikomponent komplekse wat dikwels uit endoglukanase, ekso-glukanase en sellobiase saamgestel is. Sellobiose is die hoof eindproduk van die saamgestelde aktiwiteit tussen endoglukanase en ekso-glukanase en word verder gehidroliseer tot glukose deur | 3 -glukosidases. Die ensimatiese afbraak van pektien polimere vind deur die de-esterifiserings aksie van die versepings ensiem, pektienesterase, plaas. Dit lei tot die vrystelling van die metielgroepe van die pektienmolekuul. Deur die hidrolase of <b>liase</b> aksie van die depolimerase (pektien <b>liase,</b> pektaatliase en poligalakturonase), split die a- 1, 4 -glukosidiese verbindings in die poligalakturonaatketting. Die gis Saccharomyces cerevisiae word al vir jare ekstensief in die alkoholbedryf vir die fermentasie van verskeie produkte, veral druiwe, gebruik. S. cerevisiae besit egter nie die vermoe om ekstrasellulere depolimiserende ensieme wat vir die effektiewe degradasie van polisakkariede verantwoordelik is, te produseer nie, wat die hoof oorsaak van die verhelderings- en filtreringsprobleme in onder andere wyn en bier is. Dit veroorsaak ook dat S. cerevisiae nie oor die vermoe beskik om waasvormende polisakkariede in wyn te degradeer nie. Tans word ensiempreparate in die alkoholiese bedryf vir die degradasie van die probleem polisakkariede gebruik. Sodoende word die filtreerbaarheid en kwaliteit van wyn en bier verbeter. ‘n Goeie alternatief is die ontwikkeling van S. cerevisiae-rasse wat oor die vermoe beskik om ekstrasellulere polisakkarase te produseer en dus polisakkariede self sonder die byvoeging van eksterne kommersiele ensiempreparate te degradeer. Hierdie rasse sal baie voordelig wees vir die verbetering van wynkwaliteit, sowel as vir die vermindering van die kostes verbonde aan die wynmaakproses. Die objektief van hierdie studie is dus om die uitwerking van twee getransformeerde S. cerevisiae rasse, wat ekstrasellulere polisakkarases produseer, op verskillende wyndruifvarieteite na te vors. Die volgende gene is reeds voorheen gekloneer en gekarakteriseer: die endo-pxylanase- geen (xynC) van Aspergillus niger, die endo-p- 1, 4 -glukanase-geen (endl) van Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, die pektaatliase-geen (pe/E) van Erwinia chrysanthemi en die poligalakturonase-geen (p e h l) van Erwinia carotovora. Die alkoholdehidrogenase-geenpromotor (ADH 1 P), die alkoholdehidrogenase IIgeentermineerder (ADH 2 T), die gistriptofaansintase geen se termineerder (TRP 5 t) en die sekresiesein van die gisferomoon a-faktor (MFa 1 s) is gebruik om die volgende geenkonstrukte saam te stel: ADH 1 p-MFa 1 s-end 1 -TRP 5 t (toekend as END 1), ADH 1 p-xynC-ADH 2 T (bekend as XYN 4), ADH 1 p-MFa 1 s-peh 1 -TRP 5 T fbekend as PEH 1), and ADH 1 p-MFa 1 s-pelE-TRP 5 T (bekend as PELE). Twee gisintegrerings plasmiede is gekonstrueer, een wat die END 1 - en XYN 4 - geenkassette bevat en die ander wat die PEH 1 -PELE-kasset besit. Hierdie twee plasmiede is daarna in twee aparte industriele wyngisrasse van S. cerevisiae by die URA 3 lokus geintegreer. Vir die seleksie van die industriele wyngistransformante in die afwesigheid van ouksotrofiese merkers, is die dominante selekteerbare Geneticin G 418 weerstandbiedende (G f) merker in die END 1 - en XYA/ 4 -geenkassetbevattende plasmied geintegreer. Die dominante selekteerbare sulfumetronmetielweerstandbiedende (SMR 1) merker is in die integreringsplasmied, wat die PEH 1 - PELE-geenkasset bevat, geintegreer vir seleksie. Transformasie van hierdie plasmiede in kommersiele wyngisrasse het tot die direkte sintese van die END 1 -, XYN 4 -, PELE- en PEH 1 -transkripte aanleiding gegee, sowel as tot die produksie van die biologies aktiewe ekstrasellulere endo-P- 1, 4 -glukanase, endo-P-xylanase, pektaatliase en poligalaturonase. Tydens die wynmaakproses het bogenoemde rekombinante giste aanleiding gegee tot verhoogde kleurekstraksie uit die druifdoppe van sekere varieteite, asook tot verhoogde vryvloei wyn. Dit is verkry deur die effektiewe degradasie van die glukane, xilane en pektiene in die doppe. Die rekombinante giste het ook verlaagde turbiditeit in die wyn tot gevolg gehad, wat die wyne makliker filtreerbaar maak. Hierdie werk was net die eerste stap. In die toekoms sal verdere navorsing gedoen moet word om die presiese effekte van hierdie rekombinante giste op verskillende rooi en wit druifvarieteite te bepaal. ‘n Ander fokus van hierdie tesis was om nie-Saccharomyces wyngiste vir die produksie van ekstrasellulere hidrolitiese ensieme te selekteer. Die rede hiervoor is om te bepaal watter tipes ekstrasellulere hidrolitiese ensieme geproduseer word, asook watter ensieme deur watter genera geproduseer word, ‘n Totaal van 237 gisisolate wat tot die generas Kloeckera, Candida, Debaryomyces, Rhodotorula, Pichia, Zygosaccharomyces, Hanseniaspora en Kluyveromyces behoort, is vir die produksie van ekstrasellulere pektinase, protease, p-glukanase, lichenase, p-glukosidase, sellulase, xilanase, amilase en sulfiet reduktase-aktiwiteit getoets. Hierdie giste is almal vanaf druiwe en druiwesap geVsoleer om te verseker dat dit wel giste is wat gedurende die beginfases van fermentasie in die mos teenwoordig is. Hierdie inligting kan nou verder gebruik word om die spesifieke effekte wat hierdie ensieme, wat deur die sogenaamde wilde giste geproduseer word, tydens die beginfases van fermentasies op die mos het, te bepaal. Hierdie inligting kan ook in die toekoms gebruik word om Saccharomyces-wyngiste met gene van die ri-Saccharomycesgiste te transformeer om ekstrasellulere hidrolitiese ensieme vir die degradasie van die problematiese polisakkariede in wyn te produseer. Daar sal egter in die toekoms baie navorsing gedoen moet word om die omvang van hierdie ensiemaktiwiteite in wynfermentasies te bepaal, asook om meer kennis te bekom oor die fisiologiese en metaboliese samestelling van nie-Saccfraromyces wyngiste...|$|E

Os tratamentos de superaÃÃo de dormÃncia constituÃram-se de imersÃes em Ãgua/ 24, 48 e 72 h; Ãgua quente, 50, 75 ÂC e fervente/ 10, 15 e 20 min, em H 2 SO 4 (98, 08) / 15, 30 e 60 min e controle. Para as condiÃÃes estressantes, as sementes foram imersas em 100 mL de soluÃÃo de NaCl ou de PEG 6. 000 com potenciais de solutos: [0, 0 - 0, 2, - 0, 4, - 0, 6, - 0, 8 e - 1, 0 MPa]. Avaliaram-se a embebiÃÃo (durante 168 h), percentagem de germinaÃÃo (%G) Ãndice de velocidade de germinaÃÃo (IVG) e tempo mÃdio de germinaÃÃo (TMG). Para a mobilizaÃÃo das reservas, os tratamentos foram os mesmos potencias de solutos com NaCl. A semeadura foi em papel germitest e a germinaÃÃo em cÃmara do tipo BOD a 25 ÂC com fotoperÃodo de 12 horas, com cinco repetiÃÃes de 25 sementes por tratamento. Os estudos dos efeitos do NaCl nas plÃntulas de copaÃba fez-se em trÃs estÃdios de desenvolvimento: ED 1 (raiz com 5 Â 2 cm); ED 2 (emissÃo dos protÃfilos) e ED 3 (protÃfilos expandidos), Quinze plÃntulas por repetiÃÃo foram separadas em cotilÃdones e eixos embrionÃrios. Quantificaram-se a massa seca dos cotilÃdones e dos eixos embrionÃrios, os teores de lipÃdios, proteÃnas, amido, aÃÃcares solÃveis, aminoÃcidos e Ãons Na+, K+ e Cl-. Avaliaram-se as atividades das enzimas: lipase, <b>liase</b> do isocitrato, sintase do malato, &# 945; e &# 946;-amilases e fosforilase do amido nos cotilÃdones de plÃntulas cultivadas em Ãgua destilada e em soluÃÃes de NaCl com potenciais de solutos de 0, 0, - 0, 4 e - 0, 8 MPa. A imersÃo das sementes de copaÃba em Ãcido sulfÃrico concentrado/ 60 min Ã eficiente para embebiÃÃo e superaÃÃo da dormÃncia. O PEG 6. 000 e o NaCl atrasam a embebiÃÃo. Nas condiÃÃes estressantes, o NaCl - 1, 0 MPa nÃo influencia no %G, mas, aumenta oIVG e reduz o TMG a partir do potencial de soluto de - 0, 6, MPa. O PEG reduz o %G a partir de - 0, 8 MPa com maior efeito no IVG e TMG, do que NaCl. Sementes de copaÃba possuem 42 % de lipÃdios, {{principal}} reserva. O potencial de soluto de - 0, 8 MPa inibe a mobilizaÃÃo de reservas e aumenta os teores de Ãons Na+ e Cl- nos cotilÃdones e eixos embrionÃrios de sementes de copaÃba. A inibiÃÃo da mobilizaÃÃo das reservas causada pelo sal aumenta os teores de aÃÃcares solÃveis nos cotilÃdones e inibe o crescimento das plÃntulas. As sementes de copaÃba apresentam forte resistÃncia Ã entrada de Ãgua, a qual pode ser anulada com imersÃo em Ãcido sulfÃrico concentrado por 60 min. Para o %G, as sementes testadas sÃo tolerantes ao NaCl em - 1, 0 MPa e intolerantes ao PEG em potenciais de solutos equivalentes. A germinaÃÃo Ã menos sensÃvel ao NaCl do que a fase de plÃntula. O NaCl em potenciais de solutos abaixo de - 0, 4 MPa reduzem o crescimento e desenvolvimento inicial de plÃntulas de copaÃba. As atividades das enzimas do metabolismo dos lipÃdios e do amido sÃo inibidas com o aumento da salinidade.

The treatments of over come consisted of immersion in water/ 24, 48 and 72 h, hot water, 50, 75 C and boiling water/ 10 â, 15 â and 20 â and H 2 SO 4 (98, 08 %) / 15, 30 â and 60 â min and control. For stress conditions, the seeds were immersed in 100 ml of NaCl or PEG 6000 with a potential of the solute, [0, 0 (control), - 0, 2, - 0, 4, - 0, 6, - 0, 8 and - 1, 0 MPa]. The water absorption, was evaluated (168 h) germination percentage (G%), germination speed index (GSI) and mean germination time (MGT). For the mobilization of the reserves were used as the same solute potential with NaCl above. Sowing was on paper germitest and germination in a germination chamber of the BOD at 25 ÂC and photoperiod of 12 h, consisting of five replicates of 25 seeds per treatment. Studies of the effects of NaCl was done in three stages of developing an ED (radicle with 5 Â 2 cm) ED 2 (issuing protophilus) and ED 3 (protophilus expanded), taking as reference quiescent seeds (DE 0). 15 seedlings per replicate were separated into cotyledons and axis. Quantified the dry mass of cotyledons and axis, the levels of lipids, proteins, starch, soluble sugars, amino acids and Na+, K+ and Cl-. We evaluated the activities of enzymes: lipase, the isocitrate lyase, malate synthase, &# 945; and &# 946;-amylases and starch phosphorylase in the cotyledons of seedlings grown in distilled water and in NaCl solutions with solute potential of - 0, 4 and - 0, 8 MPa. The water absorption by seeds copaiba was higher and faster in the treatments with boiling water and sulfuric acid. The PEG 6000 and NaCl delayed the time of soaking, Overall, the immersion in H 2 SO 4 performed best in breaking dormancy. In stressful conditions, NaCl had no influence on %G, however, reduced the (IVG) and increased the TMG, the solute potential of - 0, 6, - 0, 8 and - 1, 0 MPa. PEG reduced the %G in solute potential of - 0, 8 and - 1, 0 MPa and had a greater effect on IVG and TMG, compared with NaCl. The seeds were quiescent lipids as the main reserve. The increase in salinity inhibited the mobilization of reserves in the cotyledons of the seeds, especially in the solute potential of - 0, 8 and - 1, 0 MPa and increasing the concentrations of Na+ and Cl- in the embryonic axis and cotyledons. Inhibition of the mobilization of reserves caused by salt provided an increase in soluble sugars in the cotyledons, this effect inhibited the growth and seedling development. The activities of enzymes in the metabolism of lipids and of starch phosphorylase were significantly inhibited with increasing salinity, with more effectively inhibited the enzymes of lipid metabolism. The seeds have a strong resist entry of water, the immersion of the seed in concentrated sulfuric acid for 60 â is effective to remove the barrier. For %G, the copaiba seeds under conditions that were tested are NaCl-tolerant and intolerant to PEG. The germination is less sensitive than the NaCl seedling stage. The NaCl in solute potential below - 0, 4 MPa negatively affects the growth and early development of seedlings of copaib...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} recent {{initiatives to}} manage ‘cross-cutting’ issues. Issues such as drugs, homelessness and unemployment cut across government departments {{and levels of}} government. Such intractable cross-cutting issues, which are government priorities,require management actions which go beyond traditional approaches such as interdepartmental committees {{if they are to}} be tackled effectively. Joined up solutions to the problems need to be found. In this study, the national and international literature on the management of cross-cutting issues is reviewed, in order to identify good practice examples. Also, a small number of case studies of the management of cross-cutting issues – covering drugs, poverty, civil service management change, and homelessness – are investigated. Lessons are drawn from these experiences and ways of progressing the management of cross-cutting issues identified. The paper is divided into five main parts. Following the Introduction, in Chapter 2 the international and Irish policy context is addressed. In Chapter 3, the specific role of Strategic Results Areas in developing a strategic framework for crosscutting issues is explored. Chapter 4 investigates the main structures and processes used to facilitate the management of cross-cutting issues. In Chapter 5, the role of cross-cutting teams is examined in some detail. Finally, in Chapter 6, the lessons learned are summarised. The focus is on actions needed at both national and local levels in order to ensure co-ordinated service provision. Frameworks and processes for managing cross-cutting issues Chapters 2 to 4 of the paper look at frameworks and processes which have been put in place internationally and in Ireland for the management of cross-cutting issues. The emphasis is on what has been referred to as ‘joined up solutions for joined up problems. ’Developing a shared vision across participants is important. In this context, the development and tracking of Strategic Results Areas (SRAs) or their equivalent is important. Ensuring that SRAs are stepped down into actionable statements by the agencies involved is vital to their success. Encouraging political/administrative dialogue and commitment to seeing the vision through to reality is a key task – managing what New Zealand officials refer to as the ‘purple zone’ of conversation between ministers operating in the policy (blue) zone and officials operating in the administration (red) zone. A common vision must be balanced against the organisation and individual goals of participants. Recognition of self-interest is important in the process of developing common goals and trust. Co-ordinating instruments are available to facilitate co-operation and co-ordination. In particular, regulatory instruments (facilitating entry or setting up barriers to entry),financial instruments (such as capital investments, tax reliefs) and communicative instruments (the terms used to formulate issues or problems) are available to steer initiatives. Financial incentives can be particularly influential. Pilot funding to encourage joint working can usefully generate innovative approaches. With regard to mainstream funding, issues such as whether or not funding is once-off, what vote it is allocated through, and how it can be accessed must be clear. Joint budgets may be needed in some circumstances. The type of co-ordinating structures needed vary depending on the complexity of the problem. At the political level, cabinet committees and/or junior ministers with particular cross-cutting responsibilities are common approaches used to drive initiatives. At the administrative level, super-ministries, inter-departmental task forces and cross-cutting teams are the main structures used nationally. At the implementation level, various models (not necessarily mutually exclusive) are available: first stop shops; co-location of services;administrative integration; and programme integration. A strong role for the centre of government is necessary in addressing particularly intractable issues of government concern. Here, the centre sets priorities, establishes the policy framework, engages in information gathering and analysis and monitors impacts. An important catalyst for getting things done is the taking of a user perspective on issues. Where services are evaluated and audited from a user point of view, this helps to prevent organisations from being inward looking. A user perspective can help generate a culture of co-operation and co-ordination with regard to service delivery. Using cross-cutting teams Chapter 5 explores the role of cross-cutting teams, a new approach to the management of cross-cutting issues. They differ from traditional approaches such as inter-departmental committees or task forces. Teams are drawn, but operationally detached, from the constituent organisations. Co-ordination is provided by a minister/minister of state or cabinet committee. They are cross-functional in their approach to change, cutting across existing vertical hierarchies. Clarifying purpose and accountabilities is an important early task for cross-cutting teams. Building trust and respect, within the team and with the implementing agencies, is important in furthering an agreed agenda for action. Time needs to be taken early on to clarify who does what and who is responsible for what. Teams need to establish effective ground rules for behaviour. They also need to set and monitor interim milestones to check progress. Assigning the right people to teams and ensuring that they have the necessary upports(accommodation, secretarial, IT) to get on with the job is vital to their success. Human resource management policies in organisations must be adapted to encourage participation on cross-cutting teams as a developmental opportunity for staff. A blend of skills and experience is needed on teams. Where appropriate, the inclusion on the team+ of participants from key groupings, such as the community and voluntary sector, can be helpful. Teams can only do so much themselves. Getting things done through others is crucial for implementation. Within the team, members can be assigned the task of building up relationships with particular groups. Outside the team, the assignment by organisations of staff who can <b>liase</b> with the team and promote change in their own organisations can be helpful. So too is ensuring that agreed tasks are incorporated into divisional and unit business plans. Lessons learned In Chapter 6 a number of detailed lessons learned from experience are summarised. In general, lack of effective co-ordination is probably one of the most commonly heard complaints about public service delivery. A number of initiatives are now underway to tackle difficult cross-cutting issues and improve co-ordination. Central to their success is a sound understanding of the incentives operating on individuals and organisations to act as they do. Awareness is needed of the opportunities that exist to promote better joint working to arrive at joint solutions to the challenges faced. Structural, process and cultural factors all need to be addressed if effective, well co-ordinated government of cross-cutting issues is to be achieved...|$|E
40|$|Supporting good traditions Cue: In {{many rural}} areas, forests and forest {{resources}} {{are protected by}} long-standing community traditions, which govern the times when people can harvest wood from the forest, and what types of tree {{can be used for}} which purposes. However these traditional arrangements are being increasingly threatened and when they fail, national or regional laws are often too weak to protect the forest. Our next report comes from Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe, an area where many trees are being cut to provide wood for the curio carving business. An NGO, Environment Africa has been working with local communities in the area, helping them to reach agreements on how to best use and protect their forest resources. Busani Bafana asked Namo Chuma about the management systems the communities had set up, and what effect a new Environmental Management Bill might have for natural resources management in Zimbabwe. The Bill, if it is passed, will hand over much more management responsibility and power to local people. Busani began by asking whether local communities really understood the concept of sustainable forest management. IN:		?The local communities do understand ? OUT:		? and re-green Zimbabwe. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 48 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Busani Bafana calling on Zimbabweans to restore their lost forests. Transcript Chuma	The local communities do understand the concept of sustainable utilisation of forests, but they understand it from a traditional perspective, from their cultural perspective. Bafana	By ?cultural perspective?, what do you actually mean? Chuma	I mean that the communities have set aside pieces of land or some forest, which are not accessed by members of the community during certain times of the year, like during the rainy season those areas are protected, and members of the communities are not allowed to go in there. They can only use those pieces of forest during the dry season. And also communities know which species of trees to harvest, and when to do it and how to do it. Bafana	Would you say these efforts have yielded any great benefits? Chuma	Yes I would say these efforts have actually yielded a lot of benefits to the communities themselves, particularly with certain species of trees which are protected in our traditional society. There are certain species of trees which we know, and when we grow up we are told you cannot use that piece of wood when you want to make fire, or you cannot use it when you want to build your homestead, and these trees have been protected. Bafana	As far as protecting the forests, which are not only a source of various products, but also a source of livelihood, what local solutions have the communities that you work with come up with? Chuma	Some communities have come together, and they have agreed that, when you want to go and harvest timber or wood in the forest, you are supposed to follow certain procedures. You are supposed to go through the head man, or through the kraal head, and only the kraal head can authorise the amount of wood {{that you are going to}} cut in that particular forest. And also, the head man, together with his community advisors, let communities know when certain forests will be open for them to go and cut wood for both carving and building their homes. Bafana	What problems have you encountered as far as trying to help the local people utilise the principles of sustainable forest management? Chuma	Yes, we have encountered some problems, particularly with people who want to go into commercial ventures using products from the forest in the communal lands. At the end of the day, you discover that the communities are not benefiting from these commercial ventures. It will be one or two people who are benefiting from these commercial ventures, and it becomes very difficult to control these people, because they don?t <b>liase</b> with the kraal heads, they don?t even have permits from the Hwange Rural District Council, which is the local authority in charge of these two wards where we are working. So we have had serious problems with such people. Bafana	How do you think the government can support initiatives, such as those being implemented by Environment Africa? Chuma	If you look at legislation at the moment, if you are found cutting down trees the fine that you have to pay is not deterrent enough. You cut down a ?mukwa? tree that took about fifty years to mature, and you are only asked to pay a fine of fifteen dollars. And I also believe that the government should provide the resources to communities, so that communities are empowered to manage the resources in their localities, instead of having extension workers managing forests on behalf of communities. Bafana	What if at all will the impact of the Environmental Management Bill, if it is passed into law, have on sustainable management of forest by local people? Chuma	We welcome the introduction of the Environmental Management Bill. We believe that the moment it becomes law, it is going to empower communities to manage their resources. In one of the sections of the Bill, it is stated that the communities are going to be given appropriate authority status. And the moment the communities get appropriate authority status, which means they have the mandate, they have the power to manage resources in their localities, by so doing we will be empowering the communities and they are going to be associated with those resources, because they have the mandate to manage them. Bafana	And maybe just to round off, last month former South African president, Nelson Mandela, launched an initiative started by Environment Africa called ?Tree Africa?. What bearing does this have on the local efforts to manage forests? Chuma	As Environment Africa we realised that we are losing a lot of trees, and at a very fast rate. So we launched a campaign in March which is called ?Tree Africa?. Our aim is to plant about five million trees in two years. So we are calling on every Zimbabwean to be part of this campaign. Bafana	There you are, the campaign is on! Plant a tree and re-green Zimbabwe! End of track. Namo Chuma, of the NGO Environment Africa, explains how traditional arrangements have protected trees in Zimbabwe, and how a new piece of legislation could empower communities to protect their forests against illegal exploitation by commercial interests...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (PhD (Science) (Viticulture and Oenology. Wine Biotechnology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Carnitine {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in eukaryotic metabolism by mediating the shuttling of activated acyl residues between intracellular compartments. This function of carnitine, referred to as the carnitine shuttle, is supported by the activities of carnitine acyltransferases and carnitine/acylcarnitine transporters, and is reasonably well studied and understood. While this function remains the only metabolically well established role of carnitine, several studies have been reporting beneficial effects associated with dietary carnitine supplementation, and some of those beneficial impacts appear not to be directly linked to shuttle activity. This study makes use of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a cellular model system in order to study the impact of carnitine and of the carnitine shuttle on cellular physiology, and also investigates the eukaryotic carnitine biosynthesis pathway. The carnitine shuttle of S. cerevisiae relies on the activity of three carnitine acetyltransferases (CATs), namely Cat 2 p (located in the peroxisome and mitochondria), Yat 1 p (on the outer mitochondrial membrane) and Yat 2 p (in the cytosol), which catalyze the reversible transfer of activated acetyl units between CoA and carnitine. The acetylcarnitine moieties can be transferred across the intracellular membranes of the peroxisomes and mitochondria by the activity of the carnitine/acetylcarnitine translocases. The activated acetyl groups can be transferred back to free CoA-SH and further metabolised. In addition to the carnitine shuttle, yeast can also utilize the glyoxylate cycle for further metabolisation of in particular peroxisomally generated acetyl-CoA. This cycle results in the net production of succinate from two molecules of acetyl-CoA. This dicarboxylic acid can then enter the mitochondria for further metabolism. Partial disruption of the glyoxylate cycle, by deletion of the citrate synthase 2 (CIT 2) gene, generates a yeast strain that is completely dependent on the activity of the carnitine shuttle and, as a consequence, on carnitine supplementation for growth on fatty acids and other non-fermentable carbon sources. In this study, we show that all three CATs are required for the function of the carnitine shuttle. Furthermore, overexpression of any of the three enzymes is unable to crosscomplement deletion of any one of the remaining two, suggesting a highly specific role for each CAT in the function of the shuttle. In addition, a role for carnitine that is independent of the carnitine shuttle is described. The data show that carnitine can influence the cellular response to oxidative stresses. Interestingly, carnitine supplementation has a protective effect against certain ROS generating oxidants, but detrimentally impacts cellular survival when combined with thiol modifying agents. Although carnitine is shown to behave like an antioxidant within a cellular context, the molecule is unable to scavenge free radicals. The protective and detrimental impacts are dependent on the general regulators of the cells protection against oxidative stress such as Yap 1 p and Skn 7 p. Furthermore, from the results of a microarray based screen, a role for the cytochrome c heme lyase (Cyc 3 p) in both the protective and detrimental effects of carnitine is described. The requirement of cytochrome c is suggestive of an involvement in apoptotic processes, a hypothesis that is supported by the analysis of the impact of carnitine on genome wide transcription levels. A separate aim of this project involved the cloning and expression in S. cerevisiae of the four genes encoding the enzymes from the eukaryotic carnitine biosynthesis pathway. The cloned genes, expressed from the constitutive PGK 1 promoter, were sequentially integrated into the yeast genome, thereby reconstituting the pathway. The results of a plate based screen for carnitine production indicate that the engineered laboratory strains of S. cerevisiae are able to convert trimethyllysine to L-carnitine. This work forms the basis for a larger study that aims to generate carnitine producing industrial yeast strains, which could be used in commercial applications. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Karnitien vervul ‘n noodsaaklike rol in eukariotiese metabolisme deur die pendel van asiel residue tussen intersellulêre kompartemente te medieer. Hierdie funksie van karnitien heet “die karnitien-pendel“ en word ondersteun deur verskeie karnitien asieltransferases en karnitine/asielkarnitien oordragsprotiëne. Die rol van die karnitien-pendel is redelik goed gekarakteriseer en is tot op hede die enigste bevestigde rol van karnitien in eukariotiese metabolisme. Verskeie onlangse studies dui egter op voordele geasosieer met karnitien aanvulling, wat in sommige gevalle blyk om onafhanklik te wees van die pendel aktiwiteit van karnitien. Hierdie studie maak gebruik van die gis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as ‘n sellulêre model sisteem om die impak van karnitien op sel fisiologie asook die eukariotiese karnitien biosintese pad te bestudeer. Die karnitien-pendel van S. Cerevisiae is afhanklik van die aktiwiteite van drie afsonderlike karnitien asetieltransferases (CATs), naamlik Cat 2 p (gelokaliseer in die peroksisoom en die mitochondria), Yat 1 p (op die buitenste membraan van die mitochondria) en Yat 2 p (in die sitosol). Die drie ensieme kataliseer die omkeerbare oordrag van asetielgroepe tussen CoA en karnitien. Die terugwaartse reaksie stel CoA-SH vry om sodoende verbruik te word in verdere metaboliese reaksies. Gis is in staat om, afsonderlik van die karnitien-pendel, gebruik te maak van die glioksilaat siklus vir verdere metabolisme van asetiel-CoA wat gevorm word in die peroksisoom. Gedeeltelike onderbreking van hierdie siklus deur uitwissing van die sitraat sintase (CIT 2) geen, genereer ’n gisras wat afhanklik is van die funksie van die karnitienpendel en ook van karnitien aanvulling vir groei op vetsure en nie-fermenteerbare koolstofbronne. Hierdie studie dui daarop dat al drie CATs noodsaaklik is vir die funksionering van die karnitien-pendel. Ooruitdrukking van enige van die drie ensieme lei slegs tot selfkomplementasie en nie tot kruis-komplementasie van die ander twee CATs nie. Hieruit word ’n hoogs spesifieke rol vir elk van die drie ensieme afgelei. ’n Pendel-onafhanklike rol vir karnitien word ook in hierdie werk uitgewys in die bevordering van weerstand teen oksidatiewe stres. Dit is noemenswaardig dat karnitien ’n beskermende effek het in kombinasie met oksidante wat ROS genereer en ’n nadelige effek in kombinasie met sulfhidriel modifiserende agente. Dit word aangedui dat karnitien antioksidant funksie naboots in die konteks van ’n gis sel terwyl die molekuul nie in staat is om vry radikale te deaktiveer nie. Beide die beskermende asook die nadelige inwerking van karnitien is afhanklik van Yap 1 p en Skn 7 p, wat reguleerders is in die algemene beskerming teen oksidatiewe stres. Die resultate van ’n “microarray“ gebaseerde studie dui op ’n rol vir die sitokroom c heem <b>liase</b> (Cyc 3 p) in beide die beskermende en nadelige gevolge van karnitien aanvulling. Die vereiste vir sitochroom c dui op ’n moontlike rol vir apoptotiese prosesse. Hierdie hipotese word verder versterk deur ‘n analise van die impak van karnitien op genoomwye transkripsievlakke. ’n Afsonderlike doelwit van hierdie studie was toegespits op die klonering en uitdrukking van die vier ensieme betrokke in eukariotiese karnitien biosintese in S. cerevisiae. Die gekloneerde gene, uitgedruk vanaf die konstitutiewe PGK 1 promotor, was geïntigreer in die gisgenoom om die pad op te bou. Die resultate van ’n plaat gebaseerde karnitien produksie toets dui aan dat die geneties gemanipuleerde gisrasse wel in staat is om trimetiellisien oor te skakel in Lkarnitien. Hierdie werk vorm die hoeksteen van ’n studie wat die ontwikkeling van karnitien produserende kommersiële gisrasse as doelwit stel...|$|E
40|$|Executive Summary Context Local and {{national}} concerns regarding competency in newly qualified practitioners provided {{the impetus for}} the undergraduate nursing programme team at Bournemouth University to radically change the practice assessment tool as part of a curriculum rewrite in 2005. Alongside the introduction of the new practice profile, an evaluation strategy was implemented with two stages; Phase One focused on year one of implementation and reported {{at the end of that}} year (2005 - 6). These findings were used to inform mentor education and to amend the tool for new students and those moving into year two. This phase used a qualitative approach to collect data from focus groups with students and mentors (Adult Branch only), and practice/HEI educators concerning their experiences of using the grading practice assessment scheme. Phase Two utilised the qualitative findings to develop a questionnaire survey. Questionnaires were selected as the research tool in order to access greater numbers of students and mentors from across all branch programmes. Education staff was not surveyed in this phase. Purpose and project aim The purpose of the project was to evaluate the impact of the new practice assessment scheme from the perspective of the users and to make suggestions to key stakeholders for quality improvement where necessary. Phase One of the evaluation involved small numbers and only Adult branch students; whilst the findings were informative, it seemed important to test these out on a wider sample. The aim of Phase Two of the grading practice evaluation was to explore: • mentor and student experiences of using the assessment tool across all nursing branches • the impact of quality assurance processes Pertinent literature An overview of the historical and current context of practice assessment for nurses in the UK was provided, including the policy literature from the statutory body. Research on practice assessment in nursing was found to be relatively limited particularly concerning the grading of practice. Key studies include Bondy (1983; 1984) and Hillegas & Valentine (1986) from the USA, Glover et al. (1997) from Australia; from the UK, Burns (1992) and Scammell et al. (2007). All studies had limitations but generally the notion of grading practice was well received by users; however there were concerns about quality assurance processes particularly around reliability as well as issues concerning mentor/practice assessor preparation. In light of an increased national emphasis on nurses’ competency in practice, empirical work that evaluates a new practice assessment initiative is timely. Whilst of value locally in terms of reviewing and improving processes, the findings may also interest colleagues elsewhere. Project design A questionnaire survey of mentors and year two and three nursing students was undertaken to investigate their experiences of using the grading practice assessment tool. All branches of nursing were successfully targeted for inclusion using convenience sampling, but no learning disability students opted to participate. Mentors were accessed via an annual mentor conference; students were accessed via tutor groups. 112 (86 %) of the 130 mentors available, completed and returned the questionnaire. The branch representation was adult nursing (62. 5 %; n= 70), Mental Health (21. 4 %; n= 24), Child Health (17 %; n= 19) and Learning Disability (1. 8 %; n= 2). Questionnaires were distributed to 210 students; 107 were completed (51 % response). The sample comprised Adult branch (72 %; n= 77), Mental Health (19. 6 %; n= 21) and Child Health students (8. 4 %; n= 9). The response rate broadly reflected the proportion of students enrolled within each branch of the targeted cohorts. Most student respondents were undertaking year 3 of their programme (70. 1 %; n= 73); the exception was Child Health where all students were undertaking year 2. As an evaluation study, formal ethical approval was not sought; however permission was granted to conduct the evaluation by the Associate Dean for Nursing, and the educational leads within placement areas. There was a project steering group with representatives of all parties including students and mentors; their role was to oversee the project process and to <b>liase</b> with colleagues within their organisations. Quantitative data was coded and inputted into the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS for Windows version 15. 0); where possible chi-square analysis was undertaken to explore whether the results were significant. Qualitative aspects of the questionnaire were transcribed and a content analysis was undertaken. Given the sample size, it is not possible to generalise from this evaluation. Others may judge transferability to other settings. In reviewing the findings, a number of limitations must be acknowledged. The most significant limitations are that no Learning Disability students opted to participate and the response rate generally from students was not as high as anticipated (51 %). This is however a reasonable response rate for a questionnaire survey but if time had permitted, an extension to the convenience sampling may have been beneficial. Other limitations include the fact that findings were generated from reported practice and, as such, may be subject to distortions of memory. Findings Five key areas emerged from the findings: questions around mentor education indicated that participation in updates was high although the sampling process may have introduced some bias. Indeed poor uptake was identified in Phase One, reflecting other studies and anecdotal evidence for the programme team. The findings around support for practice education were mixed; mentors appeared to want more support than was available. Student experience varied according to branch – Mental health students feeling most supported and Child Health the least. However the use of neutral grades was high in both mentor and student groups indicating some cause for concern. Perception on use of the profile in terms of whether it was fit for purpose indicated positive responses overall but some confusion from both students and mentors as to the status of the written sections in comparison with skills performance; the latter was perceived as the top priority. The fourth area focused on how grading ‘worked’ and yielded some valuable perceptions. Generally respondents liked and wanted to grade or be graded in practice. Whilst the majority of mentors claimed to use the descriptors and found them useful, the number who did not use them was of concern. There were mixed perceptions of the appropriate use of second marking, some students perceiving that they were given middle grades due to logistical problems in accessing second markers, although this was not supported by the mentor data. The vast majority of mentors expressed confidence in grading students. However a significant minority responded neutrally or negatively or did not answer the question when asked whether they felt confident to fail a student. This finding is important when considered alongside the neutral response to feeling supported. Finally accountability within the assessment process appeared strong, although at times profiles were signed by staff who had not worked with the student. It is unclear however whether these mentors were primary mentors or those functioning as second markers. Overview of discussion The Phase Two evaluation was broadly supportive of the Phase One findings but extended these to other nursing branches and has provided more useful detail on some of the issues underpinning the grading practice scheme. Quality assurance is a prime issue: the evaluation has shown that reliability of the tool could be improved if the descriptors are clear and robust processes are in place to ensure these are consistently applied. Second marking is another feature of reliability and perceptions varied as to whether this was utilised as much as required and is an issue for programme and placement staff to consider, particularly in the light of inter-branch discrepancies. Students and mentors should be encouraged to constructively make any concerns known. Education around grading and support for mentors was another key area; there perhaps can never be enough support but if any staff have concerns around failing students, this needs to be addressed. The reasons for differing perceptions of support across branches, needs to be explored further. Overall the grading of competency in nursing practice yields far more benefits than problems. It is an innovative scheme, not without challenges; both evaluation phases provide valuable data to focus quality improvement effectively. Conclusion The evaluation captured the views of mentors and students representing all nursing branches, with the exception of Learning Disability students. The issues raised across the branches were broadly similar, notably that the notion of grading practice was welcomed as a means of valuing the practice element of the programme, although implementation was not without challenges. These are reflected in the focus on the quality assurance processes and in fact this is where the branch experience differs most. Mental Health students felt the most supported in placement, were the most likely to receive grades that required to be second marked (indicating full use of the grading range) and were most satisfied that mentor comments matched the grades awarded. In contrast Child Health students were the least satisfied in all these parameters. Adult branch students gave mainly neutral responses which indicate some underlying issues worthy of further investigation. It can be concluded from the mentor data that experience across branches did not differ markedly. The sample accessed updates and most felt confident in grading practice. However almost 18 % did not feel confident about failing students and almost another 20 % gave a neutral response to this question, indicating a need for further staff development in this area as well as a review of processes designed to support mentors in making these judgements. Recommendations • Explore ways of engaging learning disability students in sharing their perspective on the practice assessment tool and processes. • Increase transparency of communication channels between placement providers and the university regarding practice assessment. - Flowcharts or algorithms for mentors and students might be useful - Include these on the back of each practice profile • Review support mechanisms for students within placements. Identify best practice and include minimal standards on the clinical audit documentation to increase parity between placements and branches. • Investigate peer support schemes for students in practice which include preparation and support for those undertaking this role. • Child Health programme team should review support for students with practice partners to identify specific issues for improvement. • Review level descriptors with students, mentors as well as programme teams to ensure clarity of language and processes. • Re-emphasise the use of descriptors in mentor education as well as student preparation for placement • Review criteria and processes for second marking and emphasise within mentor education. • Disseminate HSC audit of practice profiles on a placement provider organisation basis and include a focus on quality of feedback in relation to grade awarded. • Review current practice around preparing and supporting mentors in failing students and develop an action plan for implementation over the next academic year...|$|E
