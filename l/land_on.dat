5|$|Following the {{appointment}} of General Bernard Montgomery to the command of the 21st Army Group and overall command of all ground forces to land in Normandy, the plan underwent a number of further revisions. On 21 January 1944, a revised Overlord plan was presented to General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had been chosen as the Supreme Allied Commander for the invasion. Montgomery's revised plan widened the landing area to include all of the coastline between the River Orne and the eastern coast of the Cotentin Peninsula; five divisions would <b>land</b> <b>on</b> the beaches, and supported by three airborne divisions to <b>land</b> <b>on</b> {{either side of the}} landing areas to secure their flanks and protect the landing troops from counterattack. The British airborne forces were assigned to the eastern flank, and the American airborne forces the west.|$|E

5|$|From 1992 to 1999, Nauru had a local {{government}} system {{known as the}} Nauru Island Council (NIC). This nine-member council was designed to provide municipal services.

Land tenure on Nauru is unusual: all Nauruans have certain rights to all <b>land</b> <b>on</b> the island, {{which is owned by}} individuals and family groups.

50|$|The Huygens probe, {{carried to}} Saturn's moon Titan by the Cassini, was {{specifically}} designed to survive <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> <b>land</b> and <b>on</b> liquid.

5|$|In 1872, Children of Israel {{purchased}} <b>land</b> <b>on</b> Adams Avenue, {{with the}} intent of building a new synagogue there, but financial pressures delayed the project, and in 1880 the congregation decided to sell the property and find a better one. They sold the lot in 1882, and instead purchased <b>land</b> <b>on</b> Poplar Avenue between Second and Third Streets. By 1884, they had completed a new synagogue building there, at a cost of $39,130 (today $). The Byzantine Revival structure had an impressive façade featuring twin tall spires and a large round window containing a Star of David. The building helped attract new members; by 1885 an additional 45 had joined, for a total of 173 member families, and the congregation was again debt-free. That year, the synagogue acquired a cemetery on Hernando Road.|$|E
