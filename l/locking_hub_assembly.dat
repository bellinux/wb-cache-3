40|$|A {{device for}} connecting, {{rotating}} and locking together {{a pair of}} structural half columns is described. The device is composed of an identical pair of cylindrical <b>hub</b> <b>assemblies</b> connected at their inner faces by a spring loaded hinge; each <b>hub</b> <b>assembly</b> having a structural half column attached to its outer end. Each <b>hub</b> <b>assembly</b> has a spring loading locking ring member movably attached adjacent to its inner face and includes a latch member for holding the locking ring in a rotated position subject to the force of its spring. Each <b>hub</b> <b>assembly</b> also has a hammer member for releasing the latch on the opposing <b>hub</b> <b>assembly</b> when the <b>hub</b> <b>assemblies</b> are rotated together. The spring loaded hinge connecting the <b>hub</b> <b>assemblies</b> rotates the <b>hub</b> <b>assemblies</b> and attached structural half columns together bringing the inner faces of the opposing <b>hub</b> <b>assemblies</b> into contact with one another...|$|R
50|$|Although {{a widely}} used system, {{this system is}} not as {{efficient}} as a system with <b>locking</b> <b>hubs.</b> A CAD system spins the axle shafts, spider gears, and side gears in the carrier during normal driving. <b>Locking</b> <b>hubs</b> disengage the axle at the wheels, allowing all of the axle to be at rest during normal driving. Not as efficient as <b>locking</b> <b>hubs,</b> a CAD system still makes for much less drag than having the axle completely locked in.|$|R
50|$|Unlike <b>locking</b> <b>hubs,</b> CAD {{systems are}} {{generally}} automatic and engaged when {{the vehicle is}} placed in four wheel drive. Due {{to the lack of}} driver control over the CAD, it is not as well known to the public as <b>locking</b> <b>hubs</b> are.|$|R
5000|$|DX with manual mirrors, {{no central}} locking, vinyl interior, {{optional}} AC, manual <b>locking</b> <b>hubs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|ST with {{electric}} windows, electric mirrors, central locking, carpet interior, AC, automatic <b>locking</b> <b>hubs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|RX (from 1995) with {{electric}} mirrors, central locking, carpet interior, AC, manual <b>locking</b> <b>hubs.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{they require}} a heavier {{and more complex}} <b>hub</b> <b>assembly,</b> however, these systems can result in an {{increased}} unsprung weight and require robust axle-control elements to give predictable handling. In addition, at higher speeds the <b>hub</b> <b>assembly</b> can overheat.|$|R
50|$|<b>Locking</b> <b>hubs</b> are {{obtrusive}} {{and damage}} can occur {{that can cause}} the four wheel drive system to fail — damage {{that would not be}} an issue in a CAD system. However CAD systems are mostly vacuum controlled and damage can occur to the vacuum system and to the CAD itself. Rotting of vacuum lines will cause the four wheel drive system to fail — damage that would not be an issue with <b>locking</b> <b>hubs.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Four-wheel-drive {{improvements}} {{included the}} addition of automatic <b>locking</b> <b>hubs</b> for the F-150 in 1989. Models with the 5.0L V8 also had an option of a [...] "Touch Drive" [...] electronic transfer case.|$|R
50|$|The {{innovative}} Quadra-Trac full-time four-wheel-drive system, which {{broadened the}} appeal of Jeep products to people who wanted four-wheel-drive traction without the inconvenience of a manual-shift transfer case and manual <b>locking</b> <b>hubs,</b> was introduced in 1973.|$|R
50|$|Like <b>locking</b> <b>hubs,</b> the CAD {{system is}} {{designed}} to improve fuel efficiency of the vehicle. Other, often debated, benefits of CAD systems are reduced vibration, axle wear, and noise, as well as improved steering and drivability.|$|R
25|$|The Svea Velocipede with {{vertical}} {{pedal arrangement}} and <b>locking</b> <b>hubs</b> {{was introduced in}} 1892 by the Swedish engineers Fredrik Ljungström and Birger Ljungström. It attracted attention at the World Fair and was produced in a few thousand units.|$|R
50|$|In some vehicles, manual <b>locking</b> <b>hubs</b> {{are used}} to engage the front wheels. This {{requires}} getting in/out of the vehicle to engage or disengage the front wheels. This {{may have to be}} done repeatedly if road conditions are irregular (shift from snow, then dry pavement, then snow again, repeatedly).|$|R
5000|$|A wheel <b>hub</b> <b>assembly</b> (WHA), also {{referred}} to as [...] <b>assembly,</b> wheel <b>hub</b> unit, wheel hub bearing, etc., is an automotive part used in most cars, passenger vehicles and light and heavy trucks.|$|R
5000|$|Ti (from late 1989) with {{electric}} windows, electric mirrors, central locking, velour and carpet interior, rear AC, seven speaker sound system, alloy three-spoke wheels, automatic <b>locking</b> <b>hubs.</b> The Ti model {{had a high}} roof design with sunroof until 1991. Leather and woodgrain trim was made standard in 1992 with the Series 2.|$|R
50|$|The {{company has}} three {{manufacturing}} facilities located at Jaipur, Newai and Manesar and Savli (Vadodara). The {{company will be}} investing Rs 500 crore for expansion in existing facilities and the setting up of a fourth plant. The fourth plant at Savli, near Vadodara, is about to commence production. Apart from the bearing production the company has marked its presence in Next- Gen products for which the company has laid facilities at Durgapura, Jaipur as Taper <b>Hub</b> <b>Assembly</b> division where production of <b>Hub</b> <b>Assemblies</b> for Commercial Vehicles is done. A machine building plant at Jaipur reconditions as well as assembles specific work units. The employee strength is 2500 across three plants.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, NTK Precision Axle Corporation began {{business}} with its sole facility in Frankfort, IN. The subsidiary manufactures wheel <b>hub</b> <b>assemblies</b> for {{four wheel drive}} and front wheel drive vehicles as well as axles for constant velocity joints.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1948 by Arthur Warn, who invented a <b>locking</b> <b>hub</b> system {{designed}} for use on surplus World War II Jeep vehicles. Originally based in Seattle, Washington, Mr. Warn worked with Belleview Manufacturing of Portland, Oregon to manufacture the bolt-on/bolt-off hubs. By 1954, the hubs were available as optional equipment through several major automakers.|$|R
5000|$|Isuzu {{introduced}} the five-door Isuzu Rodeo to the United States in 1990 for the 1991 model year. It was available {{with either a}} 2.6-liter inline-four engine rated at [...] or a 3.1-liter V6 engine made by General Motors (GM) which had the same power output as the 2.6, but had more torque. An automatic transmission was available for the V6. The Rodeo, like the Amigo was available in both RWD and 4WD, with the latter featuring manually <b>locking</b> <b>hubs</b> on the S version and automatically <b>locking</b> <b>hubs</b> on the XS and top-of-the-line LS. Rear-wheel ABS were standard feature on 4WDs. A RWD manual transmission model with a 21.9 usgal L tank was rated at 18 mpg in city driving by the EPA, and 22 mpg on the highway. A 4WD model with the V6 and automatic transmission was rated at 15 mpg city and 18 mpg highway.|$|R
50|$|Exposed <b>hub</b> <b>locks</b> can {{be broken}} or damaged by {{off-road}} conditions, rendering 4×4 useless and leaving the vehicle stranded. Also, in some axle designs (such as those used on older Land Rovers), the top swivel bearing can become starved for lubrication (which is normally supplied by oil slung up by the rotating axle), unless the <b>hubs</b> are <b>locked</b> every few hundred miles. Also, since <b>locking</b> <b>hubs</b> generally do not require a key to operate, they can be maliciously locked or unlocked by persons other than the vehicle owner.|$|R
25|$|In {{vehicles}} with rear disc brakes, the parking brake either actuates the disc calipers (again, with much less force) {{or a small}} drum brake housed within the <b>hub</b> <b>assembly</b> (the inner circumference of the disc is often used instead of a separate drum).|$|R
5000|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} the Big Three all started using this axle. GM began phasing {{it out in}} 1988 in favor of Independent suspension, while still {{offering}} it in some higher GVWR trucks (V-30) until 1991. Dodge used a Dana 60 up to 2002. 3rd Generation Dodge Rams dropped the Dana 60 in favor of AAM axles. Ford still uses the Dana 60 front axle. Manufactured in both Kingpin and Ball joint variations, [...] "standard" [...] (low pinion) and [...] "reverse cut" [...] rotation (high pinion) variations and open and limited slip, and locking variations. The housing material is Gray iron in early axles and Ductile iron in later axles. GM and Ford Dana 60 axles utilize <b>locking</b> <b>hubs.</b> Dodge Dana 60 axles utilized <b>locking</b> <b>hubs</b> until 1994 when a Center Axle Disconnect (CAD) system was adopted. However, model year 2002 Rams phased out the CAD system leaving some 2002 Dana 60 axles permanently locked in.|$|R
40|$|A {{ratcheting}} device comprising {{a driver}} head assembly which includes {{at least two}} 3 -D sprag elements positioned within a first groove within the driver head assembly such {{that at least one}} of the 3 -D sprag elements may lockingly engage the driver head assembly and a mating <b>hub</b> <b>assembly</b> to allow for rotation of the <b>hub</b> <b>assembly</b> in one direction with respect to the driver head assembly. This arrangement allows the ratcheting tool to impart torque in either the clockwise or counterclockwise direction without having to first rotate the ratcheting tool in the direction opposite the direction in which the torque is applied. This arrangement also allows the ratcheting tool to impart torque in either the clockwise or counterclockwise direction while in the neutral position...|$|R
50|$|The Dana 44 Front axle {{first saw}} {{use in the}} 1950s and still in use today. Dana 44 Front axles were known for {{utilizing}} <b>locking</b> <b>hubs</b> or a center axle disconnect system. However, a permanently locked-in Dana 44 is not uncommon. The Dana 44 has seen use in 1/4-, 1/2-, 3/4-, and 1-ton rated trucks. The Dana 44 was manufactured in kingpin and ball joint variations, as well as closed and open knuckle variations.|$|R
5000|$|Developed at NAMI (the National Automobile Institute), the prototype, {{known as}} NAMI 049, was {{completed}} in 1958. Unlike the Jeep, it had a Fibreglass body, four-wheel torsion bar independent suspension, and permanent four-wheel drive with <b>locking</b> <b>hubs.</b> It had a wheelbase of 1,800 mm, a ground clearance of 280 mm, and was powered by a [...] MD-65 motorcycle engine (copied from an Orbita motorcycle). Trials proved it underpowered, and the body too fragile.|$|R
5000|$|Warn Industries {{currently}} employs around 500 {{people and}} has a total of 400,000 sq/ft of manufacturing space in both Clackamas and Milwaukie, Oregon. The company has won a number awards for its products, most recently winning a [...] "gold" [...] Excellence Award from Ford Motor Company for being a top-tier supplier to the automobile manufacturer. Warn Industries supplies Ford Motor Company with wheel-end disconnects (automatic <b>locking</b> <b>hubs)</b> {{for a number of}} its pickup models.|$|R
50|$|It {{is located}} between the brake drums or discs and the drive axle. On the axle side, it is mounted to the holding bracket from the chassis; on the disc side, the wheel is mounted to the bolts of the WHA. When replacing, a wheel <b>hub</b> <b>assembly</b> should be torqued to the vehicle's {{specifications}} to prevent failure.|$|R
50|$|A new Shift-on-the-move {{four-wheel drive}} system with {{two-speed}} dual range New Process 208 aluminium transfer case was introduced on K-Series pickups for the 1981 model year. It replaced the {{permanent four-wheel drive}} system, on pre-1980 models. The shift-on-the-move four-wheel drive system featured new automatic self <b>locking</b> <b>hubs</b> and synchronized direct high range planetary gearing, such that the truck could be shifted from two-wheel drive, to fully locked four-wheel drive at speeds of up to 25 mph. Once the shift from two-wheel drive to four-wheel drive was made, the vehicle could be driven at any forward or reverse speed. Four drive modes were offered: Two High, Four High, Neutral, and Four Low. Two High gave a 0:100 torque split, with Four High yielding a locked 50:50 torque split through direct synchronized gearing. Four Low applied reduction gearing with a 2.61:1 ratio, compared to the previous New Process 205's 1.96:1. The front and rear propeller shafts were locked at all times in Four High and Four Low. Neutral was provided for disengagement of both propeller shafts. Conventional four-wheel drive was still available with manual <b>locking</b> <b>hubs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Conventional {{four-wheel drive}} pickups {{featured}} manual <b>locking</b> <b>hubs</b> and a two-speed dual range New Process 205 transfer case with four drive modes: Two High, Four High, Neutral, and Four Low. Two High gave a 0:100 torque split, while Four High yielded a locked 50:50 torque split. Four Low applied reduction gearing. The {{front and rear}} propeller shafts were locked at all times in Four High and Four Low. Neutral allowed for flat towing, or use of the power take off (PTO).|$|R
50|$|For {{model year}} 1981, {{automatic}} <b>locking</b> front <b>hubs</b> were added for shift-on-the-move four-wheel drive models, and the NP208 transfer case replaced the NP205 in most models.|$|R
50|$|On {{two-wheel drive}} F-250 and F-350 pickups, the Twin I-Beam {{independent}} front suspension with coil springs was used; their four-wheel drive counterparts were equipped with solid front axle (Dana 50 and Dana 60) with leaf springs. In 2005, the front suspension was updated as four-wheel drive trucks were converted to front coil springs; to reduce unsprung weight, the mounting of the front sway bar was changed to the frame instead of the front axle. The manual <b>locking</b> <b>hubs</b> on Super Duty trucks are made by Warn.|$|R
5000|$|Axles were Dana 44 {{front and}} 9¼" [...] or 8 1/4" [...] Chrysler {{corporate}} rear. AWD models (1973-1979) were {{equipped with the}} full-time version of the Dana 44 that had no provision for <b>locking</b> <b>hubs</b> and had a front wheel bearing design with a somewhat dubious reputation. In 1980 when the part-time 4WD system was introduced, the front Dana 44 was equipped with a more conventional front wheel bearing design and automatic <b>locking</b> <b>hubs.</b> Late in the 1984 model year the Dana 44 was switched to a CAD (Center Axle Disconnect) version. The CAD Dana 44 was vacuum actuated by a switch on the transfer case and powered by engine vacuum. The CAD Dana 44 was carried on {{until the end of}} Ramcharger production in 1993. The vacuum switch on the transfer case would occasionally fail and either leave the CAD engaged or not engage the CAD at all. Limited slip differentials were available for the 9¼" [...] rear axle. The AWD versions used a 5 on 4½" [...] wheel bolt circle and the part-time 4WD models used a 5 on 5½" [...] bolt circle. Two wheel drive models used the 5 on 4.5" [...] wheel bolt circle and in 1985 changed to the 5 on 5.5" [...] pattern.|$|R
25|$|Subaru {{introduced}} the category-expanding Leone in 1972, an inexpensive compact station wagon with a light-duty, part-time four-wheel drive {{system that could}} not be engaged on dry pavement. In September AMC introduced Quadra Trac full-time AWD for the 1973 model year Jeep Cherokee and Wagoneer. Thanks to full-time AWD, which relieved the driver of getting out to <b>lock</b> <b>hubs</b> and having to manually select between 2WD and 4WD modes, it dominated all other makes in FIA rally competition. Gene Henderson and Ken Pogue won the Press-on-Regardless Rally FIA championship with a Quadra Trac equipped Jeep in 1972.|$|R
50|$|The Bronco was {{designed}} under engineer Paul G. Axelrad. The axles and brakes from the Ford F-100 {{four wheel drive}} pickup truck were used, but the front axle was located by radius arms (from the frame near {{the rear of the}} transmission forward to the axle). A lateral track bar allowed the use of coil springs that gave the Bronco a 34 ft turning circle, long wheel travel, and an anti-dive geometry, which was useful for snowplowing. The rear suspension was more conventional, with leaf springs in a typical Hotchkiss design. A shift-on the-fly Dana transfer case and <b>locking</b> <b>hubs</b> were standard, and heavy-duty suspension was an option.|$|R
5000|$|Manual Shift On-the-Fly {{transfer}} {{cases have}} a selector lever on the driver's side floor transmission hump {{and may also}} have either two sealed automatic front axle <b>locking</b> <b>hubs</b> or two manual front axle hub selectors of [...] "LOCK" [...] and [...] "UNLOCK" [...] or [...] "FREE". To engage the four-wheel-drive system the vehicle must be moving at a low speed, {{the speed at which}} 4x4 can be engaged depends on the vehicle. This is only for the four-wheel-drive high setting. To engage the four-wheel-drive low setting, the vehicle must be stopped and the transmission must be shifted to neutral, then the four-wheel-drive low can be selected.|$|R
