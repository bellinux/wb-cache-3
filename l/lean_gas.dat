30|$|Shale {{formations}} in North America such as Bakken, Niobrara, and Eagle Ford {{have huge}} oil in place, 100 – 900 {{billion barrels of}} oil in Bakken only. However, the predicted primary recovery is still below 10 %. Therefore, seeking for techniques to enhance oil recovery in these complex plays is inevitable. Although most of the previous studies in this area recommended that CO 2 {{would be the best}} EOR technique to improve oil recovery in these formations, pilot tests showed that natural gases performance clearly exceeds CO 2 performance in the field scale. In this paper, two different approaches have been integrated to investigate the feasibility of three different miscible gases which are CO 2, <b>lean</b> <b>gases,</b> and rich gases. Firstly, numerical simulation methods of compositional models have been incorporated with local grid refinement of hydraulic fractures to mimic the performance of these miscible gases in shale reservoirs conditions. Implementation of a molecular diffusion model in the LS-LR-DK (logarithmically spaced, locally refined, and dual permeability) model has been also conducted. Secondly, different molar-diffusivity rates for miscible gases have been simulated to find the diffusivity level in the field scale by matching the performance for some EOR pilot tests which were conducted in Bakken formation of North Dakota, Montana, and South Saskatchewan. The simulated shale reservoirs scenarios confirmed that diffusion is the dominated flow among all flow regimes in these unconventional formations. Furthermore, the incremental oil recovery due to <b>lean</b> <b>gases,</b> rich gases, and CO 2 gas injection confirms the predicted flow regime. The effect of diffusion implementation has been verified with both of single porosity and dual-permeability model cases. However, some of CO 2 pilot tests showed a good match with the simulated cases which have low molar-diffusivity between the injected CO 2 and the formation oil. Accordingly, the rich and <b>lean</b> <b>gases</b> have shown a better performance to enhance oil recovery in these tight formations. However, rich gases need long soaking periods, and <b>lean</b> <b>gases</b> need large volumes to be injected for more successful results. Furthermore, the number of huff-n-puff cycles has a little effect on the all injected gases performance; however, the soaking period has a significant effect. This research project demonstrated how to select the best type of miscible gases to enhance oil recovery in unconventional reservoirs according to the field-candidate conditions and operating parameters. Finally, the reasons beyond the success of natural gases and failure of CO 2 in the pilot tests have been physically and numerically discussed.|$|R

This study is aimed at investigating the production of a <b>lean</b> <b>gas</b> condensate from a heterogeneous, fairly tight rock. The PVT model is based on the PVT report from the Gro field, a Shell/Statoil/GDF SUEZ/PGNiG <b>lean</b> <b>gas</b> condensate field in the Norwegian Sea offshore Norway. The measured data have been validated and what was not already given was calculate from correlations and assumed as standard value tables. A single well radial model has been used with gas properties determined by the composition of the sampled fluid. Rock properties are found from digitized petrophysical logs. The data file was initialized on a no-simulation basis. A single well radial model was then built to study the productivity of the field and the effect of condensate blockage on reservoir performance. This thesis presents an analysis of the characteristics and a review of performance of this tight gas condensate reservoir. An EOS based PVT model, which fits fairly well to the experimental data, is made for the Gro <b>lean</b> <b>gas</b> condensate fluid. It {{should be noted that the}} PVT model is based on mathematically decontaminated data. In the case of the Gro field it is strongly recommended not to use cutoffs in the simulation model as the flow dynamics are altered and the recovery mechanism is changed. The recovery from 5 wells is found to be 35 % of the condensate and 46 % of the gas with a production life of 20 years. The impact of stimulation on well performance and recovery on Gro is significant. Compared with no stimulation of 5 wells and increased in recovery of 9 % and 31 % for condensate and gas was found.

Experimental studies were carried out to compare the benefits of propane as an additive in steam injection and in <b>lean</b> <b>gas</b> injection to enhance production for the Minas light crude oil (34 ?API). The studies on steam-propane were specifically conducted to better understand production mechanisms involved in steam-propane injection and to investigate effects of expected field pressure and temperature conditions on steam-propane injection for the light Minas crude oil. The steam-propane experiments involved injecting steam or a mixture of steam and propane into a cell in which was tamped a mixture of sand, oil and water. The cell was placed inside a vacuum jacket set at a reservoir temperature of 200 ?F. Superheated steam at 490 ?F was injected at 4. 5 ml/min (cold-water equivalent) while the cell outlet pressure was maintained at 450 psig. A total of four runs were successfully performed with two different propane:steam mass ratios, namely, 0 : 100 (pure steam) and 5 : 100 (steam-propane). Produced liquids were collected {{from the bottom of the}} cell and analyzed to determined oil and water volumes as well as oil density and viscosity after being treated to break the emulsion. The gas injection experiments involved injecting reconstituted Minas field production gas or Minas gas enriched with propane into a cell saturated with live Minas oil. The live oil was prepared in an oil-gas recombination apparatus, and closely replicated oil properties at current reservoir conditions (solution GOR of 134 SCF/STB, bubble-point pressure of 280 psig.) Minas gas was injected at 500 ml/min into the cell set at reservoir temperature of 200 ?F. A total of four runs were successfully performed with two different propane:gas mass ratios, namely, 0 : 100 (pure <b>lean</b> <b>gas)</b> and 5 : 100 (enriched gas). The main results of the study are as follows. First, with steam-propane injection, no improvement on production acceleration time, oil recovery or steam injectivity was observed compared with pure steam injection. Second, with enriched gas injection, oil recovery increased from 61 % OOIP with <b>lean</b> <b>gas</b> injection up to 74 % OOIP with enriched gas (5 : 100 propane:gas mass ratio). Analysis of produced oil gravity and viscosity indicate little change in values compared to that of the original oil. Of the processes investigated (pure steam, steam-propane, <b>lean</b> <b>gas,</b> and enriched gas injection), enriched gas injection appears to be technically the most feasible EOR method for Minas field.

40|$|In lean {{premixed}} combustion systems, inadequate {{mixing of}} the fuel and air, prior to combustion can cause unnecessarily large pollutant emissions. Measuring the extent of mixing of fuel into air is often difficult, since combustion in <b>lean</b> premixed <b>gas</b> turbines takes place at high pressures, often making optical access to the combustion area limited. In addition, the pressure broadening of the molecular absorption lines renders the spectrally narrow line associated with a laser light source less useful. This paper studies {{some of the problems}} in determining the extent of mixing {{of the fuel}} into air in these lean premixed combustion systems. The focus of this paper is the use of an infrared light emitting diode (IR-LED) to quantitatively measure fuel concentration in a <b>lean</b> premixed <b>gas</b> turbine. The IR-LED emits radiation over a wide wavelength range compared to a laser, meaning that the development of an absorption coefficient to relate the fuel concentration to the absorption of the IR-LED radiation is not as direct as developing the absorption coefficient for the absorption of laser light. Controlled experiments were performed where the pressure, path length and fuel concentration were varied and the effects of these three parameters on the absorption of radiation from the IR-LED were studied. A broad band absorption coefficient was developed relating the absorption of light from the IR-LED to the fuel concentration. This broad band absorption coefficient was found to be in good agreement with calculated coefficient values. Experiments were performed on a <b>lean</b> premixed <b>gas</b> turbine combustor modified for line-of-sight optical access.
