5|$|According to the Ananda Ramayana, king Padmaksha had a {{daughter}} named Padma - an incarnate of the goddess Lakshmi. When her marriage is organized, Rakshasas (demons) kill the king. The grief-stricken Padma jumps into fire. Ravana discovers her body, which had turned into five jewels, in the fire and takes it to Lanka sealed in a box. Mandodari opens the box and finds Padma inside it. She advises Ravana to cast off the box containing the ill-fated Padma, who led to the doom of her father. When the <b>lid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> box is closed, Padma curses Ravana that she will return to Lanka and cause his doom.

The text of the column formed part of a longer text carved onto the interior walls of the temple and may describe the downfall of the Copán dynasty.|$|E

5|$|The spring {{still exists}} {{and is now}} the site of a small modern pumping station. Its water is pure but high in {{dissolved}} calcium carbonate leached out of the surrounding limestone. This presented the Romans with significant problems in maintaining the aqueduct, as the carbonates precipitated out of the water during its journey through the conduit. This caused the flow of the aqueduct to become progressively reduced by deposits of calcareous sinter. Another threat was posed by vegetation penetrating the stone <b>lid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> channel. As well as obstructing the flow of the water, dangling roots introduced algae and bacteria that decomposed in a process called biolithogenesis, producing concretions within the conduit. It required constant maintenance by circitores, workers responsible for the aqueduct's upkeep, who crawled along the conduit scrubbing the walls clean and removing any vegetation.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} cylinder boxes have a plain {{brown paper}} exterior, sometimes rubber-stamped {{with the company}} name. By the late 1890s, record companies usually pasted a generic printed label around {{the outside of the}} box, sometimes with a penciled catalog number but no other indication of the identity of the recording inside. A slip of paper stating the title and performer was placed inside the box with the cylinder. At first this information was hand-written or typed on each slip, but printed versions became more common once cylinders were sold in large enough quantities to justify the printing set-up cost. The recording itself usually began with a spoken announcement of the title and performer and also the name of the record company. On a typical Edison record slip from 1903, the consumer is invited to cut off a coupon with the printed information and paste it onto the <b>lid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> box. Alternatively, a circular area within the coupon could be cut out and pasted onto the end of a spindle for that cylinder in one of the specially built cases and cabinets made for storing cylinder records. Only a minority of cylinder record customers purchased such storage units, however. Slightly later, the record number was stamped on the lid, then later still a printed label with the title and artist information was factory-applied to the lid. Shortly after the start of the 20th century, an abbreviated version of this information was impressed into or printed on one edge of the cylinder itself.|$|E

30|$|Using {{aluminium}} foil {{as a witness}} coupon material, by exposing it to CC 2 for different durations, the amino acid content in CC 2 was quantitatively evaluated. To compare our results with those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National Aeronautics and Space Administration/Johnson Space Center (NASA/JSC) OSIRIS-REx team, we used the same workflow system, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative evaluation. Aluminium foil, with a thickness of 0.05  mm, was cut to 3 [*]×[*] 3  cm pieces and baked at 450  °C for 6  h. The baked {{aluminium foil}} was placed in cleaned Pyrex Petri dishes (φ 28  mm) and introduced into CC 2 (Fig.  1 b). <b>The</b> cleaning procedure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Petri dishes {{was based on the}} procedure described by Ishibashi et al.

500|$|Lacking a {{publisher}} for Diamond Trust of London, Rohrer moved onto other {{projects such as}} Inside a Star-Filled Sky and Sleep is Death. He also took on work at Gun, a video games consultancy firm, and there he made contact with Mark Seremet, CEO of Zoo Publishing. Zoo was interested in pursuing Diamond Trust of London as a limited physical release on their indiePub label, and so work on the game resumed.

500|$|Although {{tradition}} {{of stone and}} wood carving in churches largely ended at the Reformation, it continued in royal palaces, the great houses of the nobility and even the humbler homes of lairds and burgesses. The intricate <b>lid</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fourteenth-century Bute mazer, carved from {{a single piece of}} whale bone, was probably created in the early sixteenth century. At Stirling Castle, stone carvings on the royal palace from the reign of James V are taken from German patterns, and, like the surviving carved oak portrait roundels from the King's Presence Chamber, known as the Stirling Heads, they include contemporary, biblical and classical figures. These, and the elaborate Renaissance fountain at Linlithgow Palace (c. 1538.), suggest that there was a workshop with an established connected with the court in the early sixteenth century. Some of the finest domestic wood carving is in the Beaton panels made for Arbroath Abbey and at Huntly Castle, rebuilt for George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly in the early seventeenth century, which focused on heraldic images. Their [...] "popish" [...] overtones led to them being damaged by an occupying Covenanter army in 1640. From the seventeenth century, as domestic architecture for the nobility was increasingly for comfort, rather than fortification, there was elaborate use of carving in carved pediments, fireplaces, heraldic arms and classical motifs. Plasterwork also began to be used, often depicting flowers and cherubs. Richly carved decoration on ordinary houses was common in the period. There is also the heraldic carving, such as the royal arms at Holyrood Palace, designed by the Dutch painter Jacob de Wet in 1677. The {{tradition of}} carving also survived in work like the carved stone panels in the garden of Edzell Castle (c. 1600), the now lost carving done for Edinburgh and Glasgow universities in the seventeenth-century and in the many elaborate sundials of the seventeenth century, like those at Newbattle.|$|E
