In order to produce new machines and devices we have to develop its design methods. As marketing analysis shows, there isn’t any manufacturer of load lifting mechanisms in our country. “Nurnberg scissors” type load lifting mechanisms are produced abroad. But such load lifting platforms are very dangerous and might overturn since equipments’ stiffness is low. Also these load lifting platforms are very heavy. The main reason is when mechanism is in the built-up condition its state is close to singularity, that is why it is very big on reactions of kinematical chains, the value of balancing force is very high. For instance in some equipments it can be observed that balancing force is 16 times higher than <b>lifted</b> <b>load.</b> The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate optimal method of force transmission of synthesis of hydro cylindrical chain of load lifting lever mechanism and efficiently design it...|$|E

One of this {{ergonomics}} principle approach is important for unloading workers in the harbour, because their workplace and work-system have high risk of workplace accidents if the principles of ergonomics is not applied. So, the effectivity, efficiency, productivity, comfort, and health of workers in the harbour need to be maintained and improved with ergonomics approach. The bad application of ergonomics when work (lifting methods, the weight limit of <b>lifted</b> <b>load,</b> special technique of lifting) can affect the work stress and excessive work stress will cause musculosceletal fatigue.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of load on lower extremity biomechanics during the pull-phase of the clean. Kinematic and kinetic data of the three joints of the lower extremity were collected while participants performed multiple sets of cleans at three percentages: 65, 75, and 85 % of 1 -Reptition maximum (RM). General linear models with repeated measures were used to assess the influence of load on angular velocities, net torques, powers, and rates of torque development at the ankle, knee, and hip joint. The results suggest that the biomechanical demands required from the lower extremities change with the <b>lifted</b> <b>load</b> and to an extent depend on the respective joint. Most notably, the hip and knee extended significantly faster than the ankle independent of load, while the hip and ankle generally produced significantly higher torques than the knee. Torque, rate of torque development, and power at the ankle and knee joint were maximal at 85 % and 75 % of 1 -RM, respectively, whereas torque and rate of torque development at the hip were maximal at loads above 75 % and 85 % of 1 -RM, respectively. This study provides important novel information about the mechanical demands of a weightlifting exercise and should be heeded in the design of resistance training programs...|$|E

40|$|Lower {{back pain}} is {{prevalent}} {{in society and}} manual lifting has been linked as one potential cause {{of these types of}} injuries. Therefore, the 3 dLift biomechanical model was developed in this research with the goal of quantitatively analyzing lifting motions. The model divided the body into fifteen segments that were connected by fourteen anatomical joints. During experimental trials, a volunteer subject lifted an object using four different lifting combinations: symmetric leglifts, asymmetric leglifts, symmetric backlifts, and asymmetric backlifts. In order to individualize the 3 dLift model, anthropometric parameters were estimated using measurements taken on the subject. During the lifting trials, the subject wore reflective markers placed on anatomical landmarks, the motions of which were tracked by five video cameras. The subject also stood with each foot on a separate force platform that was used to determine ground reaction forces and centers of pressure. Signal processing methods were utilized to predict the marker positions that were obscured during the lifting trials, and digital filtering was implemented to attenuate noise in the data. After reducing the experimental errors, the segment coordinate axes, Cardan angles, joint center positions, and mass center positions were calculated. The changes in the segment orientations with respect to time were then analyzed to determine the three-dimensional kinematics of the segments. Anthropometric, video, and force platform information were combined in equations of motion that were derived to predict the forces and moments occurring at the joints during the lifting motions. A lower body formulation was developed that started with the measured ground reactions at the feet and proceeded through the segments to the T 10 /T 11 intervertebral joint. Similarly, an upper body formulation was derived that began with a known <b>lifted</b> <b>load</b> at the hands and continued through the segments to the same T 10 /T 11 intervertebral joint. While predicting joint forces and moments, the two formulations also served as a means of validating the 3 dLift model by comparing the results at the T 10 /T 11 joint. While there is much work yet to be done in this research area, the 3 dLift model takes the first steps by developing a systematic methodology for studying lifting motions...|$|E

50|$|Racing engines {{often fail}} at high {{rotational}} speeds because mechanical springs {{are unable to}} retract the valves quickly enough to provide clearance for the piston. Renault's pneumatic valve technology replaced steel springs with light weight compressed air bellows. These could retract valves more quickly and reduce the possibility of piston-valve interference, as long as pressure could be maintained. Additionally, the amount of seat tension required to keep a coil sprung valve under control results in greater peak <b>lift</b> <b>loading,</b> with added stress to the entire valvetrain as a result. Pneumatic systems, sharing a common reservoir of pressure retain a more static level of force, controlling the valve effectively, without any attendant peak <b>lift</b> <b>load</b> increase.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 29 - 31) Back pain is {{the most}} common and costly musculoskeletal problem in the workplace around the world. No previous study has compared the effects of asymmetrical lifting (lifting with a twist) on both upper body and lower body skeletal muscles with multiple <b>lifting</b> <b>loads.</b> It was hypothesized that the asymmetrical lifts of 20, 35, and 50 pounds could require a significantly higher muscle activation on the nine measured muscles when compared to symmetrical lifts of the same load. The dependent variables were the mean EMG activation of twelve selected muscles during the concentric upward lifting phase. The independent variables were the lifting method with two levels: symmetrical versus asymmetrical, and the <b>lifting</b> <b>load</b> with three levels of 20, 35, and 50 pounds. The results were analyzed with twelve two by three ANOVAs. The results from the twenty-two participants showed no statistical significant differences among the different conditions on mean EMG muscle activation between symmetrical and asymmetrical lifts. These results suggest that untrained individuals that lift heavy objects during their profession may exert the same muscular effort among multiple <b>lifting</b> <b>loads</b> and twisting while lifting may not alter the activation of certain muscles...|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose. Manual lifting is a {{frequent}} cause of back injury, {{and there is no}} evidence as to which training mode can provide the best training effect for lifting performance and muscle force. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the effects of a squat lift training and a free weight muscle training program on the maximum <b>lifting</b> <b>load</b> and isokinetic peak torque in subjects without known neuromuscular or musculoskeletal impairments. Subjects. Thirty-six adults (20 male, 16 female) without known neuromuscular or musculoskeletal impairments participated. The subjects' mean age was 21. 25 years (SD= 1. 16, range= 20 - 24). Methods. Subjects were divided into 3 groups. Subjects in group 1 (n= 12) performed squat lift training. Subjects in group 2 (n= 12) participated in free weight resistance training of their shoulder abductors, elbow flexors, knee extensors and trunk extensors. Subjects in group 3 (n= 12) served as controls. The maximum <b>lifting</b> <b>load</b> and isokinetic peak torques of the trunk extensors, knee extensors, elbow flexors, and shoulder abductors of each subject were measured before and after the study. Training was conducted on alternate days for 4 weeks, with an initial load of 80 % of each subject's maximum capacity and with the load increased by 5 % weekly. Results. All groups were comparable for all measured variables before the study. After 4 weeks, subjects in groups 1 and 2 demonstrated more improvement in maximum <b>lifting</b> <b>load</b> and isokinetic peak torque of the back extensors compared with the subjects in group 3, but the 2 training groups were not different. Conclusion and Discussion. The findings demonstrate that both squat lift and free weight resistance training are equally effective in improving the <b>lifting</b> <b>load</b> and isokinetic back extension performance of individuals without impairments.
