The proximity of Amiens to the Western Front and its importance as a rail hub, made it a vital British <b>logistic</b> <b>centre,</b> especially during the Battle of the Somme in 1916.

40|$|Development {{of mixed}} {{transportation}} is a prospective direction of {{development of the}} transportation system of Ukraine. The article analyses the modern state of development of mixed transportation of freight in Ukraine. The most popular types of combined transportation (refers to multi-modal) are container and contrailer trains, which are formed both in Ukraine (Viking and Yaroslav) and in other countries, first of all, Belarus (Zubr). One of the reasons of underdevelopment of mixed transportation of freight in Ukraine is absence of a developed network of transportation and <b>logistic</b> <b>centres.</b> The article offers to form a network of transportation and <b>logistic</b> <b>centres</b> in Ukraine {{as a way of}} intensification of development of mixed transportations of freight, since they facilitate co-ordination of use of various types of transport and support integrated management of material flows. Transportation and <b>logistic</b> <b>centres</b> should become a start-up complex, around which transportation and logistic clusters would be gradually formed. Transportation and logistic clusters is a new efficient form of network organisation and management of transportation and logistic services and they also ensure growth of efficiency of use of the regional transportation and logistic potential of Ukraine. The article shows prospective supporting transportation and <b>logistic</b> <b>centres</b> and centres of formation of transportation and logistic clusters in the territory of Ukraine. Formation of efficient transportation and logistic system of Ukraine {{on the basis of a}} network of transportation and logistic clusters would facilitate entering of Ukraine into the world transportation environment and would allow acceleration of introduction of efficient logistic schemes of freight delivery, in particular, mixed transportation of freight...|$|R

April 11 the squad was divided in two groups, as {{the plan was to}} surprise the Soviet troops in the front from both flanks. The group led by Lieutenant Uimonen faced the enemy soon and destroyed targeted squad, but they soon realised that they have been flanked by outnumbered enemy. The squad lost 7 men in the following battle, including Second Lieutenant V.J. Arponen and squadleader Uimonen, who stayed behind his withdrawing men with two volunteers to hold the enemy. The intel they had suggested the enemy strength on the area to be a platoon, but in reality Soviets had a whole battalion there. The Soviet troops Osasto Uimonen faced on the field were in fact preparing for a surprise attack, which they launched on the same day. After the mission failed and SissiOs./5.D lost all its acting officers it was subordinated to Kevyt osasto 19 (KevOs 19) and took part to frontline battle in the Šemenski-Pertjärvi area until the end of April and Finnish defensive victory.|$|E

After that, the method used to obtain a detailed O-D matrix for European international freight traffic will be outlined, in addition to a short explanation on the way the demand can be assigned on a multi-modal freight transportation network.
