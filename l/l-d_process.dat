40|$|As an {{archetype}} reaction for pQCD multigluon hard {{processes in}} collisions of ultrarelativistic nuclei, we analyze generic features of lepton pair production via multiphoton processes in peripheral heavy ion scattering. We report explicit results for collisions of two photons from one nucleus with two photons {{from the other}} nucleus, 2 γ + 2 γ &RARR; l(+) l(-). The {{results suggest that the}} familiar eikonalization of Coulomb distortions breaks down for oppositely moving Coulomb centers. The breaking of eikonalization in QED suggests that multigluon pQCD processes cannot be described in terms of collective nuclear gluon distributions. We discuss a logarithmic enhancement of the contribution from the 2 γ + 2 γ &RARR; l(+) <b>l(-)</b> <b>process</b> to production of lepton pairs with large transverse momentum; similar enhancement is absent for the nγ + mγ &RARR; l(+) <b>l(-)</b> <b>processes</b> with m, n > 2.

40|$|Sheet metal {{bending process}} {{is one of}} the most {{frequently}} used manufacturing operations in industry. The development optimization of the bending process is connected with time consuming and costly. Therefore, the finite element simulation of the process could be helpful tool for the designer and quality assurance of the product. Aluminium has played a great role in the development of civilization. The accuracy of the damage contour in the Aluminium sheet is directly related to the quality. After bending spring back occurs upon the removal of the tool. The amount of elastic recovery depends on the stress level and the modules of the elasticity of the material. Thispaper describes a finite element for <b>L-</b> bending <b>process</b> of the Aluminium sheet metal which allow for the prediction of the elastic spring back.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{discharge}} of azo dyes {{into the environment}} poses concerns due to their limited biodegradability. The electro-Fenton process (EF) is a good method to effectively degrade these dyes. The aim of this work was to study the mechanism and the feasibility of the EF reaction using an activated carbon fibre (ACF) cathode. In this study, two methods were {{used to measure the}} reactive species generated in anodic oxidation (AO), anodic oxidation with electrogenerated H(2) O(2) (AO-H(2) O(2)) and the EF process. Acid Red 14 (AR 14) was chosen as a model pollutant. The effects of the operational parameters, pH and initial concentrations were investigated. A short-term biodegradability test was also carried out to evaluate the EF process from a biological point of view. RESULTS: After 2 h EF reaction 118. 7 mu mol L(- 1) (center dot) OH were produced, which was much higher than that of the AO-H(2) O(2) (63. 2 mu mol <b>L(-</b> 1)) <b>process.</b> H(2) O(2) is largely generated and Fe(3 +) efficiently reduced on the high surface area of the ACF cathode. The EF process provides more effective degradation of AR 14 than the conventional Fenton process, and its current efficiency is significantly affected by the initial pH and the initial AR 14 concentration. Following EF treatment, the biodegradability of AR 14 is significantly increased. CONCLUSION: The higher formation of (center dot) OH in the EF process suggests it is an effective method for pollutant removal. This process also leads to increased biodegradability, which is expected to facilitate subsequent biological treatment. (C) 2010 Society of Chemical Industr...|$|R

A multidrug resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli strain isolated from the effluent of the biological process of an urban wastewater treatment plant was the target ARB. The higher inactivation rates (residual density under detection limit, 2 CFUm L(- 1)) were achieved with H 2 O 2 /TiO 2 /sunlight (cumulative energy per unit of volume (QUV) in the range 3 - 5 kJ L(- 1), depending on H 2 O 2 /TiO 2 ratio) and H 2 O 2 /sunlight (QUV of 8 kJ <b>L(-</b> 1)) <b>processes.</b> All investigated processes did not affect antibiotic resistance of survived colonies. Moreover, H 2 O 2 /sunlight was compared with conventional chlorination process to evaluate bacterial regrowth potential and particularly the proportion of indigenous MDR E. coli with respect to total indigenous E. coli population. Chlorination (1. 0 mg Cl 2 L(- 1)) was more effective than H 2 O 2 /sunlight (50 mg H 2 O 2 L(- 1)) to achieve total inactivation of MDR E. coli (15 min Vs 90 min) but less effective in controlling their regrowth (24 h Vs 48 h). Interestingly, the percentage of MDR E. coli in H 2 O 2 /sunlight treated samples decreased as incubation time increased; the opposite was observed for chlorinated samples...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: 2 -Octyl y-bromoacetoacetate (OyBr), an {{endogenous}} compound originally {{isolated from}} human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), {{has previously been}} demonstrated to increase REM sleep duration in cats. Based on the chemical structure of OyBr and its reported sleep-inducing effects, we synthesized OyBr along with chemically related analogs and tested these compounds as inhibitors of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), a brain enzyme that degrades neuromodulatory fatty acid amides. OyBr was found to competitively inhibit FAAH activity with IC,, and K, values of 2. 6 FM and 0. 8 PM, respectively [for the (R) -enantiomer of OyBr (l) ]. A set of synthetic analogs of OyBr was examined to define the structural features required for FAAH inhibition and inhibitor potencies were assessed at pH 9. 0 (near the pH optimum of FAAH) and pH 7. 0. Interestingly, at pH 7. 0 the y-halo P-keto ester inhibitors proved to be significantly more potent than the trifluoromethyl ketone of oleic acid, {{one of the most}} potent FAAH inhibitors described to date. This study supports the possibility that OyBr may be a physiological regulator of FAAH activity and fatty acid amide levels in vivo. Additionally, the characterization of y-halo P-keto esters as powerful FAAH inhibitors near physiological pH may aid in future studies of the enzymology and biological properties of FAAH. 0 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

This paper reports on a study to determine the impact of different concentrations of glyphosate-containing herbicides on non-target microorganisms and on the pollutant retention performance of PPS. The experiment was conducted using 0. 0484 m(2) test rigs based on a four-layered design. Previous {{studies have shown that}} PPS can trap up to 98. 7 % of applied hydrocarbons, but results of this study show that application of glyphosate-containing herbicides affected this capability as 15 %, 9 % and 5 % of added hydrocarbons were released by high (7200 mg L(- 1)), medium (720 mg L(- 1)) and low (72 mg L(- 1)) glyphosate-containing herbicides concentrations respectively. The concentrations of nutrients released also indicate a potential for eutrophication if these effluents were to infiltrate into aquifers or be released into surface waters. The effect of glyphosate-containing herbicides application on the bacterial and fungal communities was slightly different; fungi exhibited a "top-down" trend as doses of 7200 mg L(- 1) glyphosate-containing herbicides yielded the highest fungal growth whilst those with a concentration of 720 mg L(- 1) glyphosate-containing herbicides applied yielded the highest bacterial growth. In the case of protists, doses of glyphosate-containing herbicides above 72 mg L(- 1) were fatal, but they survived at the lower concentration, especially the ciliates Colpoda cucullus and Colpoda steinii thus indicating potential for their use as biomarkers of herbicide-polluted environments. Data also showed that at the lowest concentration of glyphosate-containing herbicides (72 mg <b>L(-</b> 1)), biodegradation <b>processes</b> may not be affected as all trophic levels required for optimum biodegradation of contaminants were present...|$|R
40|$|Effluents from {{wastewater}} treatment plant (WWTP) {{have been reported to}} have a broad spectrum of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). The majority of studies have focused on the occurrence of estrogenic activity, while ignoring nuclear hormone receptors (NRs) pathways. In the present study, a battery of in vitro yeast bioassays and a cell bioassay, including antagonistic and agonistic effects on estrogen receptor (ER), androgen receptor (AR), progesterone receptor (PR), estrogen-related receptor (ERR) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), were conducted to evaluate the removal efficiencies of EDCs by different treatment processes of a WWTP located in Beijing. Estrogenic, anti-estrogenic, anti-androgenic, anti-progesteronic, anti-ERR and the activation of AHR activities were detected in samples from all treatment processes and the receiving water. The concentration of estrogenic contaminants with estradiol (E- 2) equivalent concentrations ranged from 0. 82 x 10 (- 9) to 3. 54 x 10 (- 9) g E- 2 -EQ center dot L- 1.
