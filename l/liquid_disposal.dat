There is no conventional software life-cycle documentation associated with the Hanford SIM because of {{the research and development}} nature of the project. Because of the extensive use of commercial- off-the-shelf software products, there was little actual software development as part of this application. This document is meant to provide historical context and technical support of Corbin et al. (2005), which is a significant revision and update to an earlier product Simpson et al. (2001).

40|$|Recent field {{investigation}} that collected and characterized vadose zone sediments from beneath inactive <b>liquid</b> <b>disposal</b> facilities at the Hanford 200 Areas show lower than expected concentrations {{of a long-term}} risk driver, Tc- 99. Therefore laboratory studies were performed to re-create {{one of the three}} processes that were used to separate the plutonium from spent fuel and that created most of the wastes disposed or currently stored in tanks at Hanford. The laboratory simulations were used to compare with current estimates based mainly on flow sheet estimates and spotty historical data. Three simulations of the bismuth phosphate precipitation process show that less that 1 % of the Tc- 99, Cs- 135 / 137, Sr- 90, I- 129 carry down with the Pu product and thus these isotopes should have remained within the metals waste streams that after neutralization were sent to single shell tanks. Conversely, these isotopes should not be expected {{to be found in the}} first and subsequent cycle waste streams that went to cribs. Measurable quantities (~ 20 to 30 %) of the lanthanides, yttrium, and trivalent actinides (Am and Cm) do precipitate with the Pu product, which is higher than the 10 % estimate made for current inventory projections. Surprisingly, Se (added as selenate form) also shows about 10 % association with the Pu/bismuth phosphate solids. We speculate that the incorporation of some Se into the bismuth phosphate precipitate is caused by selenate substitution into crystal lattice sites for the phosphate. The bulk of the U daughter product Th- 234 and Np- 237 daughter product Pa- 233 also associate with the solids. We suspect that the Pa daughter products of U (Pa- 234 and Pa- 231) would also co-precipitate with the bismuth phosphate induced solids. No more than 1 % of the Sr- 90 and Sb- 125 should carry down with the Pu product that ultimately was purified. Thus the current scheme used to estimate where fission products end up being disposed overestimates by one order of magnitude the partitioning Sr- 90, Cs- 137, and Sb- 125 and by at least two orders of magnitude the portioning of Tc- 99 to the first and subsequent cycle waste streams that went to cribs. Conversely, the current scheme underestimates the lanthanide and yttrium fission product quantities that went to cribs by a factor of about 3...|$|E

40|$|The Oklahoma Panhandle region {{contains}} abnormally low-pressure reservoirs {{that are}} {{isolated from the}} shallow hydrostatic domain and overpressured reservoirs in the deep Anadarko basin. These underpressured reservoirs, which can be identified and mapped using available petroleum industry data, are potential repositories for liquid waste. They contain naturally low pore-fluid pressures and are completely sealed by thick confining units. Many of these compartments contain oil and gas. Fluid withdrawal during production has further reduced reservoir pressures, facilitating disposal by lowering injection and displacement pressures. Types and sizes of compartments were strongly influenced by depositional environment. Individual channel-filling sandstones within valley-fill sequences form small-compartments, whereas sandstone reservoirs formed from sediments reworked during marine transgressions became large ones. Within the carbonate domain, thick accumulations of grain-rich sediment, subsequently altered by dissolution and/or dolomitization, form large- to regional-sized compartments. Selected sandstone and carbonate reservoirs have calculated disposal volumes ranging from approximately 0. 5 million barrels to 21 million barrels per well. Compartmentalized reservoirs with abnormally low fluid pressures offer an intriguing alternative for <b>liquid</b> waste <b>disposal.</b> They exist as self-contained vessels whose seals have confined pore-fluid pressures for durations of geologic time. Seal longevity and integrity are evidenced by {{the very existence of}} naturally occurring subnormal pressures that did not equalize with the normally pressured hydrostatic environment.

40|$|A cross {{sectional}} {{survey was conducted}} to assess the prevalence rate of intestinal parasites with emphasis on hookworm infection on apparently healthy 421 elementary school children of Boloso Sorie woreda. The prevalence of intestinal parasites among the studied children {{was found to be}} 69. 4 %, of Ascaris lumbricoides dominating (40 %) followed by hookworm (26. 8). Low level of hemoglobin was not significantly associated with hookworm infection. The overall prevalence of anaemic condition (below normal level of hemoglobin) was found to be 20. 6 % (87 / 422). Promotion of appropriate solid and <b>liquid</b> waste <b>disposal,</b> supply of safe water and feet wearing are recommended. [Ethiop. J. Health Dev. 2002; 16 (1) : 113 - 115...|$|R
40|$|A {{probabilistic}} {{risk assessment}} was completed for a former {{radioactive waste disposal}} site. The site, two unlined surface impoundment, was designed {{as part of the}} <b>Liquid</b> Waste <b>Disposal</b> System (LWDS) to receive radioactive effluent from nuclear reactors in Technical Area-V (TA-V) at Sandia National Laboratories/New Mexico (SNL/NM). First, a statistical comparison of site sampling results to natural background, using EPA methods, and a spatial distribution analysis were performed. Risk assessment was conducted with SNL/NM`s Probabilistic Risk Evaluation and Characterization Investigation System model. The risk assessment indicated that contamination from several constituents might have been high enough to require remediation. However, further analysis based on expected site closure activities and recent EPA guidance indicated that No Further Action was acceptable...|$|R
50|$|Shrimp {{surviving}} a TSV infection are lifelong {{carriers of}} the viruse {{and are a}} significant source of virus for susceptible animals. It has been hypothesized that TSV was introduced to Southeast Asia with chronically infected shrimp imported from the Western Hemisphere. The ability of TSV to remain at least partly infectious after one or several freeze-thaw cycles might be a contributing factor facilitating its spread in the international commerce of frozen commodity products. Mechanisms by which infected frozen shrimp could spread the virus include: reprocessing of shrimp at processing plants with release of infectious <b>liquid</b> wastes, <b>disposal</b> of solid wastes in landfills where seagulls could acquire the virus and then spread it, the use of shrimp as bait by sport fishermen and the use of imported shrimp as fresh food for other aquatic species.|$|R
