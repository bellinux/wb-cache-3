40|$|AbstractIn {{the design}} of {{mechanisms}} with elastic joints, leaf-springs are often used. These have a large in-plane stiffness and a relatively small out-of-plane stiffness, which allows {{the design of}} elastic joints with a large stiffness in some directions, called the support stiffness, and a small stiffness in the complementary directions in which motion is desired, called the drive stiffness. Examples are a parallel leaf-spring guidance as an approximation for a prismatic joint and a cross-spring pivot as an approximation for a revolute joint. The support stiffness decreases when a joint is deflected from its central position. Also imperfections in the leaf-springs due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>flatness</b> or assembly misalignments can have this effect. Residual stresses mainly influence the torsional rigidity of leaf-springs, whereas the influence on the flexural rigidity is non-linear and becomes important near the stability limit. Initial deflections {{of the order of}} the thickness of the leaf-springs can already have a significant influence on the support stiffness in the central position...|$|E

These new type of lenses, able to produce a sequence of optical vortices, are addressed onto a programmable spatial light modulator (SLM) operating in phase-only modulation. The static aberrations arising by the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>flatness</b> of the SLM display are characterized and mostly compensated by using a Shack - Hartmann wavefront sensor. The analysis of the residual aberrations and their effect on the vortex-lens performance are studied. © Springer-Verlag 2012.

40|$|The use of {{roundwood}} in structures has drawbacks {{that include}} tapering and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>flatness,</b> {{which can be}} overcome by making a longitudinal cut to flatten one side. The aim of this work was to compare the mechanical behavior of roundwood vs. roundwood with one flat face, comparing pieces of small-diameter roundwood from young trees of Pinus nigra Arnold. Half the samples were given a longitudinal cut. Specimens taken from these pieces were tested for bending and compression parallel to the grain to determine their modulus of elasticity and strength. The modulus of rupture by bending was 22 % lower in roundwood with one flat face (59. 0 MPa) than in roundwood (75. 6 MPa). It has been observed that the smaller cross section in the roundwood with one flat face {{is not the only}} explanation for the decrease in the bending strength. In contrast, no significant differences were observed for the other three mechanical properties studied (compression strength parallel to the grain and modulus of elasticity in bending and compression) ...|$|E
40|$|The Lorentzian-shape filter {{response}} of a microring resonator filter is {{not suitable for}} practical use in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems because <b>of</b> the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> passband <b>flatness,</b> high crosstalk, and the large wing in the rejection band.

40|$|Both {{continuous}} wave and Fourier transformed pulse ultrasonic spectroscopy are being applied to material and flow characterization. Ideal samples and flaws (flat, parallel, and homogeneous) and ideal ultrasonic apparatus (producing delta function stress waves) provide acoustic spectra {{which can be}} partially inverted. However, in the presence <b>of</b> material inhomogeneity, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> sample <b>flatness</b> or parallelism, or finite risetime pulses, the spectra become quite complex and produce phase cancellations at the transducer as well as pulse shape spectral artifacts. In this paper, we examine {{the nature of these}} artifacts for both simple and practical samples. Sample spectra are contrasted for several different transducer/electronic systems. Spectra obtained with a phase insensitive acousto-electric transducer (AET) combined with a frequency tracked tone-burst spectroscopy (TBS) method are presented.

40|$|Electron {{crystallography}} is used {{to study}} membrane proteins {{in the form of}} planar, two-dimensional (2 D) crystals, or other crystalline arrays such as tubular crystals. This method has been used to determine the atomic resolution structures of bacteriorhodopsin, tubulin, aquaporins, and several other membrane proteins. In addition, a large number of membrane protein structures were studied at a slightly lower resolution, whereby at least secondary structure motifs could be identified. In order to conserve the structural details of delicate crystalline arrays, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) allows imaging and/or electron diffraction of membrane proteins in their close-to-native state within a lipid bilayer membrane. To achieve ultimate high-resolution structural information of 2 D crystals, meticulous sample preparation for electron crystallography is of outmost importance. Beam-induced specimen drift and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> specimen <b>flatness</b> can severely affect the attainable resolution of images for tilted samples. Sample preparations that sandwich the 2 D crystals between symmetrical carbon films reduce the beam-induced specimen drift, and the <b>flatness</b> <b>of</b> the preparations can be optimized by the choice of the grid material and the preparation protocol. Data collection in the cryo-electron microscope using either the imaging or the electron diffraction mode has to be performed applying low-dose procedures. Spot-scanning further reduces the effects of beam-induced drift. Data collection using automated acquisition schemes, along with improved and user-friendlier data processing software, is increasingly being used and is likely to bring the technique to a wider user base...|$|R
40|$|The {{technical}} feasibility is studied of growing single-crystal silicon ribbon {{in the space}} environment. Procedures are described for calculating the electromagnetic fields produced in a silicon ribbon by an rf shaping coil. The forces on the ribbon {{and the degree of}} shaping to be expected are determined. The expected steady-state temperature distribution in the ribbon is calculated in the one-dimensional approximation. Calculations on simplified models indicate, that <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>flatness</b> of the shaped ribbon and excessive heating of the melt by the eddy currents induced by the shaping fields may pose problems. An analysis of the relative effects of various kinds of forces other than electromagnetic showed that in the space environment capillarity forces would dominate, and that the shape of the melt is thus principally determined by the shape of any solids with which it comes in contact. This suggests that ribbon may be produced simply by drawing between parallel wires. A concept is developed for a process of off-angle growth, in which the ribbon is pulled at an angle to the solidification front. Such a process promises to offer increased growth rate, better homogeneity, and thinner ribbon...|$|E
40|$|The crotoxin complex {{protein is}} the major {{neurotoxic}} component in the venom of the Brazilian rattlesnake, Crotalus durissus terrificus. The purified protein can be crystallized {{in the form of}} thin platelets (less than 500 Å thick) suitable for electron crystallography and image processing techniques. The unit cell dimensions of the crystal are a = 38. 8 Å, b = 38. 8 Å, c = 256 Å, and α = β = γ = 90 °. These crystals can grow in layers. For a three-dimensional image reconstruction this necessitates the determination of the crystal thickness in order to combine information from low dose images of crystals of the same thickness. In the past, the highest resolution image (to 3. 9 Å) recorded from a crotoxin complex crystal on the electron microscope was from a crystal embedded in glucose. However, since glucose cannot be removed in order to accurately determine the crystal thickness, a different embedding technique (amorphous ice embedding) and tried. It was determined that high resolution image information (to 3. 9 Å) can be recorded from crotoxin complex crystals embedded in amorphous ice. Five images of crystals preserved in amorphous ice, all exhibiting resolution to at least 9 Å, were first processed by a global averaging method from which two-dimensional projection maps were calculated. These maps were not interpretable due to variations in the images as demonstrated by a second processing method. In the second processing method the images were divided into smaller areas, or patches, and these patches were averaged. The patchwork images produced from the second process indicate that there is variation across the original images. The most likely explanation for the variation is the bending, or <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>flatness,</b> of the crystals on the grid. The determination of mass thickness of the crystals from optical density differences between the crystals and the carbon support in images of freeze-dried crystals was explored. It was found that this method could not determine the mass thickness of crotoxin complex crystals to within one layer (64 Å), but could clearly distinguish between one and three overlapping layers of freeze-dried purple membrane which was used as a test specimen...|$|E

PACS nos. 04. 20 -q, 41. 20 -q, 41. 90 +e It {{is well known that}} the gravitational field modifies the electrostatic interaction of a charged particle {{in such a way that}} the particle experiences a finite self-force [1, 2]. The origin of this force comes from the space-time curvature associated with the gravitational field. On the other hand, even in the absence of curvature, such as in the conical space-time of an infinite straight cosmic string [3], it was shown that a charged point particle [4] or a linear charge distribution [5] placed at rest in this background becomes subject to a finite repulsive electrostatic self-force. In this case, the origin of this force is the distortion in the particle field caused by the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> global <b>flatness</b> <b>of</b> the space-time of a cosmic string. Therefore, the modifications of the electrostatic potential comes from two contributions, one of geometric origin and the other of topological one. Some authors have suggested that the most simple exact solutions of Einstein’s equations can easily be generalized to include a conical defect [6]. Such space-times have been considered in different context and some investigations were done in these backgrounds [7]. In this paper we determine the expression for the electrostatic potential generated by a point charge held stationary in the space-time of Reissner- Nordström pierced by a cosmic string and also determine the self-energy. These results extend previous one obtained by Linet [8] in the case of a Schwarzschild background with conical defect.

40|$|As {{touchscreen}} devices like smartphones and tablet PCs {{are becoming}} more pervasive, finger typing on a flat keyboard (either an on-screen soft keyboard on a glass or a slim keyboard {{that serves as a}} touchscreen cover) is commonplace. With a larger screen size, people are able to touch type with multiple fingers instead of tapping with a single finger. Unlike physical keyboards, typing on a flat surface is difficult due to its limitations such as <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> feedback, <b>flatness,</b> occlusion, etc. The aim of this thesis is to understand how sensory feedback that is available on a flat keyboard during touch typing might improve user performance. A series of experiments are conducted to examine how visual, haptic, and auditory keyclick feedback affect typing performance. The results indicate that haptic keyclick feedback leads to the highest typing speed with the lowest total error rate among all feedback conditions. We also examine the benefit of multimodality and information content in the sensory feedback. The results show that combined multiple modalities of sensory feedback as well as feedback with key-correctness information improve typing performance. Finally, we also examine the effect of feedback signal on touch typing performance. We first study how different haptic feedback signals affect typing performance by comparing keyclick and simple vibration haptic feedback signals. The results show that keyclick haptic feedback outperforms simple vibration in typing performance. We then study how intensity of feedback signals affects typing performance. The results show that the intensity of haptic feedback affects typing performance while the intensity of auditory feedback does not. Overall, the results of this thesis provide useful design guidelines for improving touch typing performance on a flat keyboard with sensory feedback information. ...|$|R
