5|$|California was a liner {{that had}} spent {{the first years of}} the war as an armed {{merchant}} cruiser before being converted to a troopship. She had previously carried troops to Bombay in India as part of convoys WS22 and 26. She returned to the Clyde from Gibraltar on 4June as part of Convoy MFK15 and spent the next month docked in Glasgow undergoing repairs. Once this work was complete, California began to embark 470 personnel bound for West Africa on 4July. She was to be accompanied on this voyage by SS Duchess of York, which had been tasked with carrying 600 Royal Air Force personnel and civilians to West Africa, but had missed an earlier convoy owing to electrical problems. <b>Like</b> <b>California,</b> Duchess of York was a pre-war liner which had been converted to a troopship. Prior to the ships' departure it was decided to use Duchess of York to transport elements of the 5th(West Africa) Brigade to Bombay after the ships arrived at Freetown, while California would instead carry other West African personnel to the Middle East.|$|E

25|$|American judges {{frequently}} wear black robes. American {{judges have}} ceremonial gavels, although American judges have court deputies or bailiffs and {{contempt of court}} power as their main devices to maintain decorum in the courtroom. However, {{in some of the}} Western United States, <b>like</b> <b>California,</b> judges did not always wear robes and instead wore everyday clothing.

25|$|Since 1938, {{many states}} have adopted rules similar to the FRCP. However, some states, <b>like</b> <b>California,</b> have civil {{procedure}} systems, which deviate significantly from the federal rules; the California Codes provide for four separate types of class actions. As a result, there are two separate treatises devoted solely to the complex topic of California class actions. Some states, such as Virginia, do not provide for any class actions, while others, such as New York, limit the types of claims that may be brought as class actions. In 2013, several class action lawsuits have been filed under both the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and similar Michigan state laws against some of Michigan's largest medical providers and collection agencies which may have a dramatic impact on the collection of unpaid medical bills and the collection industry as a whole.|$|E
25|$|For most of history, {{regional}} tradition largely dictated {{what type}} of vine training would {{be found in a}} given area. In the early 20th century, many of these traditions were codified into specific wine laws and regulations such as the French Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) system. The widespread study and utilization of various training systems began in the 1960s when many New World wine regions were developing their wine industry. Without the centuries of tradition that influenced Old world winemaking and viticulture, vine growers in areas <b>like</b> <b>California,</b> Washington, Australia and New Zealand conducted large scale research into how particular vine training systems, pruning and canopy management techniques impacted wine quality. As research in this area continued into the 21st century, new vine training systems were developed that could be adapted to the desired wine making style the grapes were destined for as well as the labor needs and particular mesoclimate of the vineyard.|$|E

500|$|In {{the past}} century, Cabernet Sauvignon {{has enjoyed a}} swell of {{popularity}} {{as one of the}} noble grapes in the world of wine. Built partially on its historical success in Bordeaux as well as New World wine regions <b>like</b> <b>California</b> and Australia, planting the grape is considered a solid choice in any wine region that is warm enough to cultivate it. Among consumers Cabernet has become a familiar wine which has aided in its accessibility and appeal even from obscure wine regions and producers. In the 1980s, the [...] Bulgarian wine industry was largely driven and introduced to the international wine market by the success of its Cabernet Sauvignon wines. The widespread popularity of Bordeaux has contributed to criticism of the grape variety for its role as a [...] "colonizer" [...] grape, being planted in new and emerging wine regions at the expense of focus on the unique local grape varieties. Some regions, such as Portugal with its abundance of native grape varieties, have largely ignored Cabernet Sauvignon as it seeks to rejuvenate its wine industry beyond Port production.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{estimated}} that around 500,000 earthquakes occur each year, detectable with current instrumentation. About 100,000 of these can be felt.

Larger earthquakes occur less frequently, the relationship being exponential; for example, roughly ten times as many earthquakes larger than magnitude 4 occur in a particular time period than earthquakes larger than magnitude 5.

2500|$|Historically, states {{initially}} {{tried to}} prohibit driving {{with a high}} level of BAC, and a BrAC test result was merely presented as indirect evidence of BAC. [...] Where the defendant had refused to take a subsequent blood test, the only way the state could prove BAC was by presenting scientific evidence of how alcohol in the breath gets there from alcohol in the blood, along with evidence of how to convert from one to the other. [...] DUI defense attorneys frequently contested the scientific reliability of such evidence. [...] In response, many states <b>like</b> <b>California</b> subsequently modified their BAC statutes so to directly prohibit a certain level of alcohol in the breath as an alternative to a prohibited level of BAC. In other words, the breath test result itself, the BrAC level, became the direct predicate evidence for conviction. In other states, such as New Jersey, the statute remains tied to BAC, but the BrAC results of certain machines have been judicially deemed presumptively accurate substitutes for blood testing when used as directed.|$|E

However, having the nomination locked up early also gave McCain time to build a national organization and put his general election strategy into action for the six months leading up to the Republican National Convention. McCain planned to raise money and visit several sites in the U.S. before embarking on a tour of Europe and the Middle East as part of a congressional delegation.
