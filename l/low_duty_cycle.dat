40|$|We present Koala, a {{reliable}} data retrieval {{system designed to}} operate at permille (. 1 %) <b>duty</b> <b>cycles,</b> essential for long term environmental monitoring networks. Koala achieves these <b>low</b> <b>duty</b> <b>cycles</b> by letting the network’s nodes sleep {{most of the time}} and reviving them through an efficient wake-up strategy whenever the gateway performs a bulk data download. Unlike other systems which consume energy to maintain consistent network state (e. g. routes, sleep schedules, etc.) across the network’s nodes, Koala maintains no persistent routing state on the motes. Instead, a basestation calculates the network paths using reachability information collected by the motes. The Flexible Control Protocol (FCP), a protocol we developed, is then used to install this routing information on the network’s nodes. This paradigm of operation not only eliminates the overhead of maintaining routing state, but also significantly reduces the complexity of the networking code running on the motes. Results from simulation and an actual implementation on TinyOS 2 indicate that Koala can achieve very <b>low</b> <b>duty</b> <b>cycles</b> under a wide range of download and network sizes. 1...|$|R

30|$|Since one of {{the main}} goals in WSN {{protocol}} design is energy efficiency, many protocols work with <b>low</b> <b>duty</b> <b>cycles</b> by including periods in which the transceiver is put to sleep. SMAC was {{one of the}} first protocols designed with this in mind and works by coordinating sleep-wake times for neighboring nodes in combination with a contention-based transmission scheme [17]. Because of its pioneering role, SMAC has become a protocol of reference in WSN. Other examples of protocols that also use <b>low</b> <b>duty</b> <b>cycles</b> and coordinated activity times are T-MAC [18], RMAC [19], and DW-MAC [20]. A different approach that has also been explored is asynchronous transmission, in which nodes, instead of agreeing on recurring activity periods, use messages to indicate when transmissions can happen. Examples of protocols using asynchronous duty cycling are B-MAC [21], XMAC [22], and Wise-MAC [23]. These protocols succeed in achieving high energy efficiency. However, since they use contention-based transmissions, only achieve high throughput under low traffic conditions.|$|R

With the default parameters, under medium to high load, 802. 15. 4 generates excessive collisions and packet losses. <b>Low</b> <b>duty</b> <b>cycles</b> even exacerbate the problem, because more nodes become active after {{long periods of}} sleep and contend for channel access.

Surprisingly, the approach perfectly applies to 802. 15. 4 even if the principles of the two access methods fundamentally differ. Based on the model, we propose ABE, an adaptation method that adjusts the contention window to optimal values so that the network obtains high throughput along with <b>low</b> <b>duty</b> <b>cycles</b> leading to <b>low</b> energy consumption.

50|$|High-power impulse {{magnetron}} sputtering (HIPIMS or HiPIMS, {{also known as}} high-power pulsed {{magnetron sputtering}}, HPPMS) is a method for physical vapor deposition of thin films {{which is based on}} magnetron sputter deposition.

Distinguishing features of HIPIMS are a high degree of ionisation of the sputtered metal and a high rate of molecular gas dissociation which result in high density of deposited films. The ionization and dissociation degree increase according to the peak cathode power. The limit is determined by the transition of the discharge from glow to arc phase. The peak power and the duty cycle are selected so as to maintain an average cathode power similar to conventional sputtering (1-10 W⋅cm−2).|$|E
50|$|Time-hopping (TH) is a {{communications}} signal technique {{which can be}} used to achieve anti-jamming (AJ) or low probability of intercept (LPI). It can also refer to pulse-position modulation, which in its simplest form employs 2k discrete pulses (referring to the unique positions of the pulse within the transmission window) to transmit k bit(s) per pulse. To achieve LPI, the transmission time is changed randomly by varying the period and duty cycle of the pulse (carrier) using a pseudo-random sequence. The transmitted signal will then have intermittent start and stop times. Although often used to form hybrid spread-spectrum (SS) systems, TH is strictly speaking a non-SS technique. Spreading of the spectrum is caused by other factors associated with TH, such as using pulses with <b>low</b> <b>duty</b> <b>cycle</b> having a wide frequency response.

5000|$|HIPIMS {{generates a}} high density plasma {{of the order}} of 1013 ions⋅cm−3 {{containing}} high fractions of target metal ions. The main ionisation mechanism is electron impact, which is balanced by charge exchange, diffusion, and plasma ejection in flares. The ionisation rates depend on the plasma density.The ionisation degree of the metal vapour is a strong function of the peak current density of the discharge. At high current densities, sputtered ions with charge 2+ and higher - up to 5+ for V - can be generated. The appearance of target ions with charge states higher than 1+ is responsible for a potential secondary electron emission process that has a higher emission coefficient than the kinetic secondary emission found in conventional glow discharges. The establishment of a potential secondary electron emission may enhance the current of the discharge.

30|$|A popular MAC {{standard}} {{described by}} IEEE 802.15. 4 for {{wireless sensor networks}} and actuator networks defines two operating modes: non-beacon-enabled mode where the receivers are always awake to receive a frame and beacon-enabled mode which describes super frames where the nodes are only awake during {{a small part of}} a super frame and they sleep quite often. In the second mode, significant traffic results in frequent collisions and packet losses which causes an increase in energy consumption and low throughput. To operate IEEE 802.15. 4 with <b>low</b> <b>duty</b> <b>cycles</b> needs MAC parameter adjustment to attain low energy consumption. The beacon-enabled mode behavior is analyzed in [38] to define the main performance bottlenecks. The adaptation method is referred to as ABE where a coordinator observes the number of idle slots before a transmission starts. However, a node consumes energy to observe idle slots because it needs to be awake. This problem is solved by delegating tracking of idle slots to the coordinator that always needs to stay awake during the active period. ABE is compared with the IEEE 802.15. 4 standard configured with static backoff exponent which specifies the size of the contention window values. Results show that ABE provides optimal throughput without considering the number of nodes. The value of the contention window which optimizes throughput is found by the coordinator in ABE. The adaptation mechanism in ABE which adjusts the optimal contention window values yields high throughputs along with <b>low</b> <b>duty</b> <b>cycles,</b> leading to <b>low</b> energy dissipation.|$|R
