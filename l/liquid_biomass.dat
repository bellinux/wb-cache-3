40|$|This study {{considered}} {{the current situation}} of solid and <b>liquid</b> <b>biomass</b> fuels in Finland. The fact that industry consumes {{more than half of}} the total primary energy, widely applied combined heat and power production and a high share of solid biomass fuels in the total energy consumption are specific to the Finnish energy system. Wood is the most important source of bioenergy in Finland, representing 20 % of the total energy consumption in 2007. Almost 80 % of the woodbased energy is recovered from industrial by-products and residues. As a member of the European Union, Finland has committed itself to the Union’s climate and energy targets, such as reducing its overall emissions of green house gases to at least 20 % below 1990 levels by 2020, and increasing the share of renewable energy in the gross final consumption. The renewable energy target approved for Finland is 38 %. The present National Climate and Energy Strategy was introduced in November 2008. The strategy covers climate and energy policy measures up to 2020, and in brief thereafter, up to 2050. In recent years, the actual emissions have exceeded the Kyoto commitment and the trend of emissions is on the increase. In 2007, the share of renewable energy in the gross final energy consumption was approximately 25 % (360 PJ). Without new energy policy measures, the final consumption of renewable energy would increase to 380 PJ, which would be approximately only 31 % of the final energy consumption. In addition, green house gas emissions would exceed the 1990 levels by 20 %. Meeting the targets will need the adoption of more active energy policy measures in coming years. The international trade of biomass fuels has a substantial importance for the utilisation of bioenergy in Finland. In 2007, the total international trading of solid and <b>liquid</b> <b>biomass</b> fuels was approximately 77 PJ, of which import was 62 PJ. Most of the import is indirect and takes place within the forest industry’s raw wood imports. In 2007, as much as 21 % of wood energy was based on foreign-origin wood. Wood pellets and tall oil form the majority of export streams of biomass fuels. The indirect import of wood fuels peaked in 2006 to 61 PJ. The foreseeable decline in raw wood import to Finland will decrease the indirect import of wood fuels. In 2004 – 2007, the direct trade of solid and <b>liquid</b> <b>biomass</b> fuels has been on a moderate growth path. In 2007, the import of palm oil and export of bio-diesel emerged, as a large, 170 000 t/yr biodiesel plant came into operation in Porvoo...|$|E

Glycerol, both crude from the biodiesel manufacturing and refined, and pyrolysis oil are tested as bio-based feedstocks.

Especially the ease of pressurization, which is required for large scale synthesis gas production, is another clear advantage of <b>liquid</b> <b>biomass.</b> In addition to this, liquefied biomass contains less contaminants than the biomass from which it originates which will be beneficial with respect to catalyst poisoning.

In this thesis, methane as a model compound for natural gas is investigated. By co-reforming, implying partnering with the current fossil-based industry, use is made of the existing infrastructure and markets which should help the introduction of bio-based synthesis gas.

40|$|The {{dissolution}} of biomass into ionic liquids (ILs) {{has been shown}} to be a promising alternative biomass pretreatment technology, facilitating faster breakdown of cellulose through the disruption of lignin and the decrystallization of cellulose. Both biological and chemical catalysis have been employed to enhance the conversion of IL-treated biomass polysaccharides into monomeric sugars. However, biomass-dissolving ILs, sugar monomers, and smaller carbohydrate oligomers are all soluble in water. This reduces the overall sugar content in the recovered solid biomass and complicates the recovery and recycle of the IL. Near-complete recovery of the IL and the holocellulose is essential for an IL-based pretreatment technology to be economically feasible. To address this, a solvent extraction technique, based on the chemical affinity of boronates such as phenylboronic acid and naphthalene- 2 -boronic acid for sugars, was applied to the extraction of glucose, xylose, and cellobiose from aqueous mixtures of 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium acetate.

40|$|Ionic <b>liquid</b> {{pretreatment}} of <b>biomass</b> {{has been}} shown to greatly reduce the recalcitrance of lignocellulosic biomass, resulting in improved sugar yields after enzymatic saccharification. However, even under these improved saccharification conditions the cost of enzymes still represents a significant proportion of the total cost of producing sugars and ultimately fuels from lignocellulosic biomass. Much of the high cost of enzymes is due to the low catalytic efficiency and stability of lignocellulolytic enzymes, especially cellulases, under conditions that include high temperatures and the presence of residual pretreatment chemicals, such as acids, organic solvents, bases, or ionic liquids. Improving the efficiency of the saccharification process on ionic <b>liquid</b> pretreated <b>biomass</b> will facilitate reduced enzyme loading and cost.

In the field of fermentation industry, they are ideal hosts for secondary metabolites and recombinant protein production. At the industrial-scale, equipments usually required for solid-state or submerged fermentation of filamentous fungi have demonstrated their limitations in terms of productivity, mass transfers or products recovery (1, 2). Recently, fungal biofilm reactors were designed to combine advantages from submerged and solid-state culture and reveal their usefulness for greater secondary metabolites production relative to submerged culture conditions (3). In our work, we propose the design of a fungal biofilm reactor for a recombinant protein production from an Aspergillus oryzae strain containing a GFP reporter gene system under the control of a promoter specifically induced in solid-state conditions. The fungal biofilm reactor is composed of a metal structured packing, having the function of inert support for biofilm growth, immerged or aspersed by a liquid medium. Whereas recombinant protein production is not significantly different at the flask-scale between submerged and biofilm conditions, productivity is higher in the submerged conditions at the bioreactor-scale. Presence of recombinant proteins entrapped in the biofilm matrix highlights a diffusion constraint and a lower mass transfer in our fungal biofilm reactor. However, persistence of a free <b>liquid</b> <b>biomass</b> of low viscosity and fungal biomass retention on the support are attractive for the implementation of a continuous process in our fungal biofilm reactor.

Validation is achieved by comparing the numerical results obtained with CFD with the experimental measurements. The purpose of this research is to increase the scientific understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of the spray combustion process using a carbon neutral fuel such as ethanol and biodiesel. In fact, very few numerical simulations of <b>liquid</b> <b>biomass</b> fuels in gas turbine systems are available in the literature. The flames are simulated using the commercial code FLUENT. The combustion/turbulence interaction is modelled using the laminar flamelet approach with detailed chemistry modelled using the OPPDIFF model from CHEMKIN. While the experiments could be carried out only up to 3 atm, the simulations were further extended to a maximum pressure of 10 atm. The FLUENT results were assessed qualitatively and quantitatively between the experimental measurements and the simulation. The cold flow features have been captured by the present simulations with a good degree of accuracy. Effect of air preheating was investigated for the biodiesel, and sensitivity to droplet size and spray angles variation were analysed. Good agreement was obtained for ethanol except in the fuel lean region due to failure of the FLUENT laminar flamelet model to capture local flame extinction while biodiesel simulation resulted in a significant overprediction of the flame temperature especially in the downstream region and satisfactory results further upstream. The results show the importance of setting proper droplet initial conditions, since it will significantly affect the structure of the flame.

The Dutch renewable energy action plan (published in summer 2010) specifies the increase in consumption of renewable electricity and transportation fuels to meet 2020 targets. It is very likely (and stated in the Dutch action plan) that both solid and <b>liquid</b> <b>biomass</b> will contribute heavily to {{the increasing use of}} renewable energy in the Netherlands in the next ten years. As the domestic biomass potential is limited, and biomass imported from both EU countries and outside the EU may be available at the same cost (or even less) than domestic streams, it is expected that the import of biomass to the Netherlands will further increase in the coming years. Dutch policy makers also see the need for imports, but are also concerned regarding the sustainable production of bioenergy abroad. Since 2008, NL Agency executes the program: “Global Sustainable Biomass” (DBM) and in 2009 it became executive body of the program “Sustainable Biomass Import (DBI), the latter being part of the program “Biobased Economy” within the Innovation Agenda. The goal of DBM is to support developing countries to produce biomass for energy purposes more sustainably, considering the access to local and international energy market. The goal of the DBI program is to give an impulse to the development of sustainable international biomass supply chains for energy and chemical applications. In 2009 and 2010, approximately 20 million euro of subsidy was allocated to 45 projects, in which market actors and research institutes aim to increase the sustainability of biomass production in developing countries and realize import of biomass to the Netherlands.
