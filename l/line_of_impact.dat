50|$|Collision is short-duration {{interaction}} between two bodies {{or more than}} two bodies simultaneously causing change in motion of bodies involved due to internal forces acted between them during this. Collisions involve forces (there {{is a change in}} velocity). The magnitude of the velocity difference just before impact is called the closing speed. All collisions conserve momentum. What distinguishes different types of collisions is whether they also conserve kinetic energy. The <b>Line</b> <b>of</b> <b>impact</b> is the line which is collinear to the common normal of the surfaces that are closest or in contact during impact.

40|$|Using the {{cascade of}} effects model, this chapter {{discusses}} the impacts chronic hazard conditions {{can have on}} environment, economy, social capital, and health. In particular, this chapter investigates these impacts {{through the lens of}} provisioning capacity {{in order to understand the}} vulnerability and resilience of the populations. Looking specifically at two separate sites in Ecuador that are chronically affected by an active volcano, researchers used questionnaire surveys, key personnel interviews, focus groups, and health records to study the impacts of this hazard including personal experience, damage/loss, perceptions, provisioning, and health. Results show a direct <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>impact</b> from the volcano to provisioning capacity and to health, showing that an increased ability to provide food led to better health and a reduced perception of risk. The authors argue this can ultimately mitigate individual vulnerability and facilitate community resilience. In this chapter, provisioning capacity relates to a household’s ability to provide itself with adequate food and water and can be seen as both a measure of vulnerability and resilience and an influence on associated outcomes such as physical and psychological health. Included in this measure are variables related to both capacity (at the time of the survey) and a perceived change in capacity over the impact period.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the part of the {{organizational}} research process, access negotiation, through reflexive analysis of the participation in a recent data collection process. The paper aims is to question two emergent norms in this area: first, that organizational anonymity be granted in exchange for organizational access; and second, that access negotiation be seen as a bounded activity at the start of data collection. Design/methodology/approach – Through the reflexive account and with reference to published accounts of practice in other research projects, the authors explore the reasons why researchers offer organizational anonymity, and note the unintended consequences of this practice. The authors locate the discussion in relation to increased expectations on social researchers to contribute to public debate about managing and organizing. Findings – The author suggests that the negotiation of access without promising anonymity may generate more situated accounts of organization, and greater participation in political or ethical debates surrounding work, organization, and management. By facilitating a clearer <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>impact</b> stemming from qualitative research, this would also aid researchers in demonstrating the value of their work in informing public debate. Social implications – The authors conclude by reiterating the potential for organizational researchers to achieve greater social and ethical impact, especially if the authors frame access negotiation as a continuous process rather simply as than a moment at the start of a project. Originality/value – The authors argue that the paper raises a key, but neglected, issue in conducting empirical organizational research, that has political and ethical implications as well as a methodological significance. Through the analysis, the authors encourage themselves and the research community to be clearer about the potential value of scholarship in debates happening outside the academy, and to see access negotiation as more complex than simply a transaction in which organizational anonymity is promised in return for data.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the in-situ precipitation of polyelectrolytes during droplet impacts and its applications in enhancing the retention efficiency of sprays. Large amounts of agricultural sprays are wasted worldwide, due to the poor retention on hydrophobic plants. As the harmful effects of pesticides in particular are more and more pointed out, there is an increasing pressure to reduce their use and make their spraying more efficient. Current solutions, mainly based on surfactants, all have limitations. Here, we present a novel idea based on the modification of the surface of the plant. By precipitating opposite polyelectrolytes, in-situ, we create sparse pinning sites that pin the contact <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> the <b>impacting</b> droplets from the spray and prevent them from bouncing off. We first study the behavior <b>of</b> the <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> two droplets containing oppositely charged polyelectrolytes on a hydrophobic surface. We then study the precipitation process of two polyelectrolytes and develop a model that predicts the outcome of a double drop impact. Finally, we show the macroscopic applications of this study, by using simultaneous spraying. Simultaneously spraying dilute opposite polyelectrolytes on a superhydrophobic surface leads to a large increase in the liquid retention and the coverage of the surface. The behavior has been shown to hold for different polyelectrolytes and surfaces, making this method suitable for a range of applications. by Maher Damak. Thesis: S.

Using methods commonly applied to observations of clusters, we conduct synthetic X-ray observations of 3 D MHD simulated jet-ICM interactions to test the reliability of measuring X-ray cavity power. These measurements are derived from empirical estimates of the enthalpy content of the cavities and their implicit ages. We explore how such physical factors as jet intermittency and observational conditions such as orientation of the jets {{with respect to the}} <b>line</b> <b>of</b> sight <b>impact</b> the reliability <b>of</b> observational measurements of cavity enthalpy and age. An estimate of the errors in these quantities can be made by directly comparing "observationally" derived values with "actual" values from the simulations. In our tests, cavity enthalpy derived from observations was typically within a factor of two of the simulation values. Cavity age and, therefore, cavity power are sensitive to the accuracy of the estimated inclination angle of the jets. Cavity age and power estimates within a factor of two of the actual values are possible given an accurate inclination angle. Comment: 34 pages, 14 figures, accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R

The net effect of air flow on the impacting water droplet was investigated by controlling the droplet impact velocity to make it similar with and without air flow. In cold atmospheric conditions with temperatures as low as − 30 °C, due to the large increase of both internal and contact line viscosity combined {{with the presence of}} ice nucleation mechanisms, supercooled water droplet wetting behavior was systematically affected. Instantaneous pinning for hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces was observed when the spread drop reached the maximum spreading diameter (i. e., no recoiling phase). Nevertheless, superhydrophobic surfaces showed a great repellency (e. g., contact time reduction up to 30 % where air velocity was increased up to 10 m/s) at temperatures above the critical temperature of heterogeneous ice nucleation (i. e., − 24 °C).
