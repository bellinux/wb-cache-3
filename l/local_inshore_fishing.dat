50|$|During {{the early}} 19th century a major seal hunting {{industry}} had developed, {{and the population}} of the community increased to its peak of 1400. After 1880, the population declined due to large steamships now being used for the sealing fishery. After World War II and Confederation, the <b>local</b> <b>inshore</b> fishery expanded rapidly and by the mid 1970s housed 3 fish plants and had major <b>inshore</b> multipurpose <b>fishing</b> fleets. It became {{known as one of the}} most prominent and progressive fishing communities in the province.|$|R

40|$|Information on the {{distribution}} and intensity of <b>inshore</b> <b>fishing</b> activity is needed to inform marine spatial planning and to assess fisheries interactions with the environment and other industries. Although fishing vessels under 15 m (overall length) account for 98. 4 % (2011 value) {{by the number of}} the European fleet, information on <b>inshore</b> <b>fishing</b> activity in Europe is very limited as there is no statutory satellite monitoring of smaller vessels (< 15 m length before 2012, < 12 m thereafter). Here, we develop, present, and apply a method which uses sightings-per-unit-effort (SPUE) estimates calculated from fisheries enforcement data to describe {{the distribution}} and intensity of <b>inshore</b> <b>fishing</b> activity off the coasts of England and Wales. For the larger inshore vessels, the SPUE estimates of activity were validated with vessel monitoring system (VMS) data and showed good agreement at the scale of analysis. Fishing activity estimates from SPUE are presented with an assessment of uncertainty, to account for spatial differences in enforcement activity. Our estimates of the distribution and intensity of <b>inshore</b> <b>fishing</b> activity and will complement estimates of offshore fishing activity based on VMS...|$|R

50|$|The Lord Howe Island Group {{supports}} a diverse <b>inshore</b> <b>fish</b> fauna with greater than 400 species recorded. 10% {{of the marine}} <b>inshore</b> <b>fish</b> species {{are known to be}} endemic, meaning they are only found at Lord Howe Island, while 8% of the 110 species of echinoderms are also endemic. A wide variety of seabirds roost and nest on the island but feed on schools of fish and squid. This diversity reflects the mixing of tropical species with temperate species and the range of marine environments present.|$|R
40|$|<b>Inshore</b> <b>fishing,</b> by boats under 10 m, {{has a long}} {{tradition}} on the coasts of England but its role in the contemporary communities is not well understood, and increasingly policy makers have become focused on trying to find ways to improve its environmental, social and ecological sustainability. This paper reports on a research project that sought, through case studies on the English coast, to explore the socio-cultural role that <b>inshore</b> <b>fishing</b> plays and how policies could be developed to enhance its contributions. <b>Inshore</b> <b>fishing</b> was found to be highly valued not only for its importance in supporting livelihoods, but also in the creation of place identities tied to fishing as an occupation and the ecological opportunities for fishing that are available at the different localities. Findings are discussed in the context of harnessing these attributes for fostering sustainable fishing communities, underpinned by strengthening the ties between the catch and the locality...|$|R

40|$|The 21 st Century Catch Toolkit is {{a product}} of the INTERREG IVa 2 Seas project GIFS (Geography of <b>Inshore</b> <b>Fishing</b> and Sustainability). Work on the GIFS project was {{completed}} between January 2012 and September 2014 and was undertaken by a collaboration of six partners from four European countries bordering the Southern North Sea and English Channel. GIFS aimed to understand and capture the social, economic and cultural importance of <b>inshore</b> <b>fishing</b> to better inform fisheries policy, coastal regeneration strategies and sustainable community development. The project has involved a range of research projects, regeneration activities and case studies across southern England, northern France, Flanders and the southern Netherlands. GIFS partners have worked with local stakeholders and communities to explore the geographical diversity and similarities of fishing ports, harbours and people along the Channel and Southern North Sea. This toolkit {{is a product}} of that collaboration which provides useful findings and advice on how to value the social, economic and cultural importance of <b>inshore</b> <b>fishing</b> today...|$|R

30|$|Vibrio parahaemolyticus was {{isolated}} from the internal organs of diseased sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) cultured in a marine cage farm and an <b>inshore</b> <b>fish</b> farm in the summer 2010. All strains isolated from diseased sea bass were tested for virulence by intraperitoneal injection. The isolates (n[*]=[*] 6) were pathogenic for sea bass. Only bacterial strains showing haemolytic activity were virulent. LD 50 values ranged from 3.52 [*]×[*] 104 to 2.29 [*]×[*] 106  cfu fish− 1.
