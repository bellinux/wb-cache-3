500|$|Bass's {{announcement}} {{received a}} large amount of media attention. The American public's reaction was generally positive, with Bass receiving [...] "overwhelming support" [...] from many teenagers and young adults who grew up listening to 'N Sync. However, Bass received criticism from the LGBT community when he referred to himself and his friends as [...] "straight-acting" [...] in his People interview, stating, [...] "I call them the SAGs— the straight-acting gays. We're just normal, typical guys. I <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> football and drink beer." [...] This comment angered some members of the LGBT community, who believed that Bass not only implied that effeminate gay men were not 'normal', but further enforced unneeded stereotypes. In a 2007 interview with The Advocate, Bass called his comment a [...] "mistake" [...] and noted that he was unaware of the negative implications surrounding the term. Bass stated, [...] "Every community is hard to please. Our community is very fickle. It's a touchy community because it's the last civil rights movement we have left here in America. So when someone new like myself comes along and says off-the-mark things, yeah, I can see how people would get pissed." ...|$|E
500|$|Amrita Daityari, {{author of}} Sourav Ganguly: the fire within, {{noted that in}} ODIs, where Ganguly usually opened the innings, he {{used to try to}} take the {{advantage}} of fielding restrictions by advancing down the pitch and hitting pace bowlers over extra cover and mid-off. She commented: [...] "Ganguly was notorious for attacking left-arm spin bowlers. Due to excellent eye–hand coordination, he was noted for picking the length of the ball early, coming down the pitch and hitting the ball aerially over mid-on or midwicket, often for a six. However, he did have a weakness in running between the wickets and judging quick singles." [...] There were many instances where Ganguly's batting partner was run out due to Ganguly's calling for a run, and then sending him back while halfway down the pitch. A situation like this happened in an ODI against Australia where he took a single when on 99, but he coasted and did not ground his bat. Although the bat was past the crease, it was in the air and he was consequently run out. Ganguly said, [...] "I <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> myself hit a cover drive, to watch myself hit a hundred." [...] Ganguly's relationship with former Indian coach John Wright has been well documented in contemporary media, with them denoting the relationship as a [...] "symbiotic process". They credited Wright and Ganguly with bringing out international class performers, through academic, coaching and scientific fitness regimens. According to Dubey, Ganguly and Wright, along {{with other members of the}} team like Tendulkar and Dravid, were the first to understand the importance of a foreign coach for the Indian cricket team and was convinced that the domestic coach has outlived its utility. Ganguly's aggressive style and Wright's importance on fitness ushered in the development of a better cricket team for India.|$|E

500|$|One of Disney Channel's {{most popular}} and {{successful}} original shows, Kim Possible remains the project for which Schooley and McCorkle are best known. Few anticipated Kim Possible would become as successful as it ultimately did, proving popular among {{both male and female}} audiences. Explaining Kim Possibles universal appeal, the creators said, [...] "Whenever there's an action complement to a show, boys get excited, and when Kim does her martial arts and when she's doing one of these incredible stunts, boys <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> it ... And {{one of the things that}} we’ve always found is that boys of any age ... love humour and characters that are a little goofy, sort of silly and weird. When we tested it, the kids were like: 'Oh, Ron's stupid funny' and that became sort of a buzz phrase." [...] Ron's role helped maintain a strong male audience throughout the series. Kim Possible was greeted with a level of enthusiasm that had not been experienced since the Disney Afternoon Lineup, becoming Disney Channel's most successful post-1990s show. Disney Channel Worldwide President Rich Ross extolled Kim Possible as a [...] "stand-out" [...] among both the network's live-action and animated catalogue.

Entertainment Weekly ranked Kim Possible fourth on its list of the 25 greatest Disney Channel Original Series, calling it an [...] "animated gem".

Fairies there, thought I; remembering that rainbows bring out the blooms, and that, if one can but get to the rainbow's end, his fortune is made in a bag of gold. Yon rainbow's end, would I were there, thought I. And none the less I wished it, for now first noticing what seemed some sort of glen, or grotto, in the mountain side; at least, whatever it was, viewed through the rainbow's medium, it glowed like the Potosi mine. But a work-a-day neighbor said, no doubt it was but some old barn--an abandoned one, its broadside beaten in, the acclivity its background. But I, though I had never been there, I knew better.|$|E
