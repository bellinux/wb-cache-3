The insert is threaded into a pre-tapped hole, or some inserts tap their own threads in a drilled or molded hole.

A thin walled solid bushing insert by the trademarked name TIME-SERT is locked in by rolling the bottom few internal thread into the base material with a special install driver which will permanently lock the insert in place. Key locking inserts, more commonly known by the trademarked name Keenserts, use keys that are hammered into grooves through the threads, permanently locking the insert.

The transverse normal strain is linear in the thickness direction z and the related shell theory is free from Poisson <b>locking.</b> Finite <b>element</b> <b>locking</b> mechanisms (shear and membrane locking) have been opportunely corrected: good convergence rate has been shown for the considered shell problems (with various geometries, thickness ratios and stacking layer sequences).

40|$|Abstract. Database {{integrity}} constraints, {{understood as}} logical conditions that must hold for any database state, {{are not fully}} supported by current database technology. It is typically up to the database designer and application programmer to enforce integrity via triggers or tests at the application level, which are difficult to maintain and error prone. Two important aspects must be taken care of. 1. It is too time consuming to check integrity constraints from scratch after each update, so simplified checks before each update should be used relying {{on the assumption that}} the current state is consistent. 2. In concurrent database systems, besides the traditional correctness criterion, the execution schedule must ensure that the different transactions can overlap in time without destroying the consistency requirements tested by other, concurrent transactions. We show in this paper how to apply a method for incremental integrity checking to automatically extend update transactions with locks and simplified consistency tests on the <b>locked</b> <b>elements.</b> All schedules produced in this way are conflict serializable and preserve consistency in an optimized way. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} evidence of morphological differences {{in support of}} the current phylogenetic division of the owls into two familes (Strigidae, Tytonidae), with respect to the digital tendon locking mechanism (TLM). This mechanism consists of modified surfaces on the flexor tendons in the digits, which, when engaged form a lock that holds the digits in a flexed position. Although species-specific differences in TLM structure were apparent, consistent inter-family differences occurred in the degree of expression of the TLM, its location within the digit, and in the structure and arrangement of the <b>locking</b> <b>elements.</b> Phylogenetic differences also occurred in the location of the associated digital ligaments. The TLM of the Strigidae was found to resemble that of the Falconiformes (Falconidae and Accipitridae).

40|$|Semiconductor {{technology}} scaling {{has enabled}} drastic {{growth in the}} computational capacity of integrated circuits (ICs). This constant growth drives an increasing demand for high bandwidth communication between ICs. Electrical channel bandwidth {{has not been able}} to keep up with this demand, making I/O link design more challenging. Interconnects which employ optical channels have negligible frequency dependent loss and provide a potential solution to this I/O bandwidth problem. Apart from the type of channel, efficient high-speed communication also relies on generation and distribution of multi-phase, high-speed, and high-quality clock signals. In the multi-gigahertz frequency range, conventional clocking techniques have encountered several design challenges in terms of power consumption, skew and jitter. Injection-locking is a promising technique to address these design challenges for gigahertz clocking. However, its small locking range has been a major contributor in preventing its ubiquitous acceptance. In the first part of this dissertation we describe a wideband injection locking scheme in an LC oscillator. Phase locked loop (PLL) and injection <b>locking</b> <b>elements</b> are combined symbiotically to achieve wide locking range while retaining the simplicity of the latter.

40|$|Abstract. In {{a recent}} paper of Arnold, Brezzi, and Marini [4], {{the ideas of}} {{discontinuous}} Galerkin methods were used to obtain and analyze two new families of <b>locking</b> free finite <b>element</b> methods for the approximation of the Reissner–Mindlin plate problem. By following their basic approach, but making different choices of finite element spaces, we develop and analyze other families of <b>locking</b> free finite <b>elements</b> that {{eliminate the need for}} the introduction of a reduction operator, which has been a central feature of many locking-free methods. For k ≥ 2, all the methods use piecewise polynomials of degree k to approximate the transverse displacement and (possibly subsets) of piecewise polynomials of degree k − 1 to approximate both the rotation and shear stress vectors. The approximation spaces for the rotation and the shear stress are always identical. The methods vary in the amount of interelement continuity required. In terms of smallest number of degrees of freedom, the simplest method approximates the transverse displacement with continuous, piecewise quadratics and both the rotation and shear stress with rotated linear Brezzi-Douglas-Marini elements. 1...|$|R
