50|$|If the 16-bit {{data value}} starts at an odd address, the {{processor}} {{may need to}} perform two memory read cycles to load the value into it, i.e. one for the <b>low</b> <b>address</b> (throwing away half of it) and then a second read cycle to load the high address (throwing away again half of the retrieved data). On some processors, such as the Motorola 68000 and Motorola 68010 processors, and SPARC processors, unaligned memory accesses will result in an exception being raised (usually resulting in a software exception, such as POSIX's SIGBUS, being raised).|$|E
50|$|A control {{interval}} normally contains multiple records. The {{records are}} stored within the control interval {{starting from the}} <b>low</b> <b>address</b> upwards. Control information is stored {{at the other end}} of the control interval, starting from the high address and moving downwards. The space between the records and the control information is free space. The control information comprises two types of entry: a control interval descriptor field (CIDF) which is always present, and record descriptor fields (RDF) which are present when there are records within the control interval and describe the length of the associated record. Free space within a CI is always contiguous.|$|E
50|$|In computing, {{a virtual}} address space (VAS) or address space is {{the set of}} ranges of virtual {{addresses}} that an operating system makes available to a process. The range of virtual addresses usually starts at a <b>low</b> <b>address</b> and can extend to the highest address allowed by the computer's instruction set architecture {{and supported by the}} operating system's pointer size implementation, which can be 4 bytes for 32-bit or 8 bytes for 64-bit OS versions. This provides several benefits, one of which is, if each process is given a separate address space, security through process isolation.|$|E

50|$|Compaction {{proceeds}} {{from the bottom of}} the heap (low addresses) to the top (high addresses). As live (that is, marked) objects are encountered, they are moved to the first available <b>low</b> <b>address,</b> and a record is appended to a break table of relocation information. For each live object, a record in the break table consists of the object's original address before the compaction and the difference between the original address and the new address after compaction. The break table is stored in the heap that is being compacted, but in an area that are marked as unused. To ensure that compaction will always succeed, the minimum object size in the heap must be larger than or the same size as a break table record.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to the way}} {{chunks of}} memory are {{allocated}} in such an environment, the bytes at high address &hA000 <b>low</b> <b>address</b> 64000 to 64768, can be written to with no negative effects. This lets the programmer save the additional bytes, 256 (colors) × 3 (color channels) = 768 bytes, {{at the end of}} the screen capture file. These have to be read back out again and written to the color port for them to change, when an image containing a footer of color info gets loaded. A method used with this was to have a global palette, and match the colors from an old color palette, to a new color palette. This meant changing the index of each pixel, where it would point to a near perfect match of one color from old to new color set. This also had drawbacks, as sometimes there were not enough gradients, and artifacts and such would appear.|$|E
3000|$|Address Evenness- An {{effective}} address distribution means better utilization of address space as the available address space is limited. An even distribution indicates <b>low</b> <b>address</b> duplication probability and better utilization of address space. Hence, this metric is {{the measurement of}} protocol effectiveness on address distribution. For all existing auto-configuration approaches, address evenness is achieved by design; the only exception is for the Buddy protocol. In Table  1, protocol that achieves evenness by design is indicated as [...] "yes" [...] and a protocol that shows unevenness or achieves evenness by additional measures is indicated as [...] "no".|$|E

50|$|In OpenGL and Portable Network Graphics (PNG), the RGBA (byte-order) is used, {{where the}} colors are stored in memory such that R is at the <b>lowest</b> <b>address,</b> G after it, B after that, and A last. On a little endian {{architecture}} this is equivalent to ABGR (word-order).|$|R

2500|$|In big-endian format, {{whenever}} addressing {{memory or}} sending/storing words bytewise, {{the most significant}} byte — the byte containing the most significant bit — is stored first (has the <b>lowest</b> <b>address)</b> or sent first, then the following bytes are stored or sent in decreasing significance order, with the least significant byte — the one containing the least significant bit — stored last (having the highest address) or sent last. Little-endian format reverses this order: the sequence addresses/sends/stores the least significant byte first (<b>lowest</b> <b>address)</b> and the most significant byte last (highest address). Most computer systems prefer a single format for all its data; using the system's native format is automatic. But when reading memory or receiving transmitted data from a different computer system, it is often required to process and translate data between the preferred native endianness format to the opposite format.|$|R

50|$|Endianness {{refers to}} the {{sequential}} order used to numerically interpret a range of bytes in computer memory as a larger, composed word value. It also describes the order of byte transmission over a digital link. Words may be represented in big-endian or little-endian format, depending on whether bits or bytes or other components are numbered from the big end (most significant bit) or the little end (least significant bit). When addressing memory or sending/storing words bytewise, in big-endian format, the most significant byte, which is the byte containing the most significant bit, is sent first (has the <b>lowest</b> <b>address)</b> and the following bytes are sent (or addressed) in decreasing significance order with the least significant byte, which is the byte containing the least significant bit, thus being sent in last place (and having the highest address). Little-endian format reverses {{the order of the}} sequence and addresses/sends/stores the least significant byte first (<b>lowest</b> <b>address)</b> and the most significant byte last (highest address). The order of bits within a byte or word can also have endianness (as discussed later); however, a byte is typically handled as a numerical value or character symbol and so bit sequence order is obviated.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} a lookup {{table for the}} addressing of an optimally shaped constellation. The method is based on partitioning the subconstellations into shaping macro-shells of integer bit rate and increasing average energy. A lookup table is used to select {{a subset of the}} partitions in the Cartesian product space. By devising appropriate partitioning/merging rules, we obtain suboptimum schemes of very <b>low</b> <b>addressing</b> complexity and small performance degradation. The performance is computed using weight distribution of an optimally shaped constellation. ...|$|R

50|$|Memory (storage) in System/360 is {{addressed}} {{in terms of}} 8-bit bytes. Various instructions operate on larger units called halfword (2 bytes), fullword (4 bytes), doubleword (8 bytes), quad word (16 bytes) and 2048 byte storage block, specifying the leftmost (<b>lowest</b> <b>address)</b> of the unit. Within a halfword, fullword, doubleword or quadword, low numbered bytes are more significant than high numbered bytes; this is {{sometimes referred to as}} big-endian. Many uses for these units require aligning them on the corresponding boundaries. Within this article the unqualified term word refers to a fullword.|$|R
