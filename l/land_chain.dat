It is {{surrounded}} by forestry <b>land.</b> <b>Chain</b> pickerel, which is not a native species in Nova Scotia, was illegally introduced around 1998.The lake used to have a good population of speckled trout, and several other species, but since the pickerel were introduced the trout, perch and minnows have no longer been found.An estimated 1,100 pickerel were in the lake in 1998, some as large as 1.25 kg.The lake is open for winter fishing of chain pickerel by holders of a general fishing license. In 2006 the season was 1 January to 31 March, with a bag limit of 25 fish per day.The same dates and bag limit applied in 2011.On 19-20 February 2011 the ministry threw the lake open to fishers who did not have a license.In 2012 the lake was open all year for chain pickerel fishing.|$|E

At length he raised a small square stone which covered a metallic plate, and, taking from his vest a carnelian talisman covered with strange characters, he knocked thrice upon the plate with the signet.

The chain fastened without difficulty to the rock, and was evidently constrained by some magnetic influence. The Prince, seizing the chain with both his hands, now swung across the ravine. As he <b>landed,</b> the <b>chain</b> parted from the rock, swiftly disappeared down the opposite aperture, and its covering closed with the same low, solemn murmur as before.|$|R

The Spartans misinterpreted this oracle, believing that it referred to them measuring out the line to split it into kleros (the land allocated to each Spartan citizen upon coming of age). They then marched to battle carrying rods with which to parcel out their soon-to-be-conquered <b>land</b> and <b>chains</b> (fetters) with which to shackle their soon-to-be-conquered Arcadian Helots.

30|$|Land planarians are {{free-living}} flatworms {{that live}} in humid environments. They cannot endure desiccation since they have not developed mechanisms for water conservation (Kawaguti 1932). Therefore, they hide from the sunlight (under fallen logs and leaf litter) and exhibit greater activity at night, predating on soil invertebrates such as earthworms, snails, slugs, insects and arachnids (Negrete et al. 2014 a; Prasniski and Leal-Zanchet 2009).

5000|$|The name [...] "Chambira" [...] {{refers to}} the dense growth of Chambira palms that cover the region. Otherwise known as Astrocaryum chambira, this native plant has many uses.

The Selva is a tropical climate so it is home to a variety of plants and other life forms. Tropical fruits such as bananas grow there. In the river itself is a plethora of different freshwater species, not limited to but including turtles, fish, caimans, stingrays, and electric eels. [...] All of these species make up an aquatic food chain that indirectly feeds the land as well. Land animals eat the aquatic fish which is returned to the earth in the form of fertilizer.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to {{increase}} our understanding on how land markets and housing markets interact in a spatial context. The term housing <b>land</b> supply <b>chain</b> is used to comprise development land, housing lot and house markets. Hedonic models are estimated for each based on a large good quality dataset. Two concepts are used to measure price ratios in the housing land supply chain: (1) the land share of a house price and (2) a ratio of development land price to lot price. The paper combines housing economics and spatial analysis. Hedonic models produce a trend surface, and residuals are mapped to reveal the local effects. Thematic maps are used to visualize the spatial structure of error terms. Two scales are used: grid level to get an overview, and transaction level for exact local effects. The paper tries to offer a broad, deep and transparent view of the housing market. The data consists of more than 45. 000 transactions during the last 21 years in Helsinki metropolitan area. The results may be valuable in property valuation and management of housing policy. TS 7 – GIS and Valuatio...|$|R
5000|$|A December 1942 {{camouflage}} {{report for}} the Department of Aircraft Production indicated that while looking at sites for additional hangars {{it was noted that}} the Department of Civil Aviation contemplated extensions of runways east of Beatty Road, and that action was being taken to acquire a strip of <b>land</b> 15 <b>chains</b> deep parallel with Kerry Road which was intended to become the main access road to the aerodrome. It was noted that at some future date it was intended to remove some of the existing hangars at Archerfield and place them along Kerry Road, and this may account for the location of the existing igloos well back from the road. Eventually five large igloos with ancillary buildings were constructed. Work on the first of the five igloos (either no.3 or no.4) and ancillary buildings was commenced around February 1943 by contractor William Hughes and Co Pty Ltd. It has been noted that [...] "The igloos are a testament to the then Commonwealth Government's philosophy of dual purpose planning, of high cost projects for wartime and post-war".

50|$|It was {{not until}} late 1944 that the <b>land</b> forces <b>chain</b> of command was clarified, after Stilwell was {{recalled}} to Washington. His overall role, and the CBI command were then split among three people: Lt Gen. Raymond Wheeler became Deputy Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia; Maj. Gen. Albert Wedemeyer became Chief of Staff to Chiang, and commander of US Forces, China Theater (USFCT). Lt Gen. Daniel Sultan was promoted, from deputy commander of CBI to commander of US Forces, India-Burma Theater (USFIBT) and commander of the NCAC. The 11th Army Group was redesignated Allied Land Forces South East Asia (ALFSEA) under a new commander Lieutenant-General Oliver Leese who had relinquished command of the Eighth Army in Italy, and NCAC (which by this time included Chinese, American and British units) was placed under ALFSEA. As the drive to liberate Burma began in earnest however, Chiang Kai-shek and Wedemeyer made increasing demands for NCAC's formations to be moved to the China Theatre to meet the threat of Japanese attacks from the north. Once the Burma Road from Mandalay to Chungking was secured NCAC became passive and in March 1945 Mountbatten agreed to the US and Chinese troops in NCAC being gradually withdrawn to the China.|$|R
40|$|Soils are key resources, {{providing}} essential {{ecosystem services}} and functions for supporting {{both human and}} ecosystem needs. Intensification and expansion of human activities has been putting a dramatic pressure on land throughout history. In the last 15 years, substantial efforts {{have been made to}} incorporate the impacts on land derived from production processes from a life cycle perspective, in order to improve the comparison of the environmental performance of products. It is critical for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) the use of robust models that enable evaluating the effects of land use on soils. The present study performs a systematic, qualitative evaluation of up-to-date models that relate land occupation and land transformation to soil impact indicators in terms of soil properties, functions and threats. We evaluated both single and multi-indicators models against criteria including scientific soundness, stakeholders’ acceptance, reproducibility, as well as the applicability of models from the perspective of LCA practitioners. The study additionally proposes a new <b>land</b> use cause-effect <b>chain</b> to appraise the impacts of land use on soils. We identified a heterogeneous set of soil-related models, with relevant improvements in terms of applicability, robustness and completeness as compared to previous analyses. Trade-offs were frequent between the relevance of the modeled impact processes and model’s applicability. We identified several research needs, which include: adopting a common <b>land</b> use cause-effect <b>chain</b> and <b>land</b> use classification; accounting for different land management and land use intensities; assessing the added value of multi-indicators for comprehensively account for impacts; ensuring consistency from midpoint to endpoint, especially for biodiversity impacts; providing guidance to calculate normalization factors; and assessing the uncertainty of models results. Building consensus in the LCA community is essential to secure the comparability of models and setup robust practices for further developments. JRC. D. 3 -Land Resource...|$|R
