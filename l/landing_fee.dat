5|$|In 1991, the Athens Airport {{charged a}} 25% higher <b>landing</b> <b>fee</b> for those {{aircraft}} arriving between 11:00 and 17:00 during the high tourism season during summer. Hong Kong charges an additional flat fee {{to the basic}} weight charge. In 1991–92 peak pricing at London's main airports Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted was implemented; airlines were charged different landing fees for peak and off-peak operations depending on the weight of aircraft. For example, {{in the case of}} a Boeing 757, the peak <b>landing</b> <b>fee</b> was about 2.5 times higher than the off-peak fee in all three airports. For a Boeing 747 the differential was even higher, as the old 747 carries a higher noise charge. Though related to runway congestion, the main objective of these peak charges at the major British airports was to raise revenue for investment.|$|E
25|$|On August 1, 2005, the Santa Monica City Council {{implemented}} a revised <b>landing</b> <b>fee</b> program (Resolution No. 9855) for all transient aircraft (those not {{based at the}} Santa Monica Airport) based on a uniform rate of $2.07 per 1000 pounds of Maximum Certificated Gross Landing Weight. Since the Santa Monica Airport receives no federal, state or local funding to operate, the landing fees fill the gap between other Airport revenue {{and the cost of}} operations.|$|E
25|$|There {{were also}} threebased aircraft, {{all of which}} were single engined, and two enplanement {{passenger}} boardings as of 2011. Updated statistics for the Omak Airport are scheduled to be released in July2013. Although statistics have not been released by the FAA, it has been thought that a number of services are provided for commuter passenger service by the Omak City Council. Packages can be delivered to other airports by FedEx and the United Parcel Service (UPS) using Cessna 208 Caravans and Beechcraft Model 18s from Empire Airlines, FedEx Express and Pierce Aviation; the second has a fuel contract with the Omak City Council. Lifeline Aviation also commonly uses the airport. There is no non-commercial <b>landing</b> <b>fee.</b>|$|E

500|$|Many {{airports}} are facing extreme congestion, runway capacity being the scarcest resource. Congestion pricing schemes {{have been proposed}} to mitigate this problem, including slot auctions, such as with the Panama Canal, but implementation has been piecemeal. The first scheme was started in 1968 when higher landing fees for peak-hour use by aircraft with 25 seats or less at Newark, Kennedy, and LaGuardia airports in New York City. As {{a result of the}} higher charges, general aviation activity during peak periods decreased by 30%. These fees were applied until deregulation of the industry, but higher fees for general aviation were kept to discourage this type of operations at New York's busiest airports. In 1988 a higher <b>landing</b> <b>fee</b> for smaller aircraft at Boston's Logan Airport was adopted; with this measure much of the general aviation abandoned Logan for secondary airports. In both US cases the pricing scheme was challenged in court. In the case of Boston, the judge ruled in favor of general aviation users due to lack of alternative airports. In the case of New York, the judge dismissed the case because [...] "the fee was a justified means of relieving congestion".|$|E

50|$|Complaints over {{slots and}} <b>landing</b> <b>fees</b> have plagued the busy airport. Because so many {{airlines}} {{want to use}} it, the Japanese aviation authorities extend use time for Narita International Airport until midnight, and cut cost by denationalization. In 2004, New Tokyo International Airport Authority (NAA) was privatized and turned into Narita International Airport Corporation (NAA). Narita's <b>landing</b> <b>fees</b> were once more than double of those of Incheon International Airport (¥195,000 in November 2012), Singapore Changi Airport, and Shanghai Pudong Airport (¥170,000 in November 2012). In 2014, the policy of Open skies was implemented. Airlines can increase or decrease the number of its flights freely, and Narita's <b>landing</b> <b>fees</b> was cut by up to 50%.|$|R

2500|$|On Tuesday, 29 April 1941, the Flitfires left Flushing Airport {{and were}} ferried to LaGuardia Field {{in groups of}} six (plus {{squadron}} leader) flying in close formation. [...] The normal $2.50 <b>landing</b> <b>fee</b> was waived by Mayor LaGuardia. Traffic was handled by airport cars using two way radios. Each aircraft was equipped with a portable radio loaned by Lear Avia Inc. Control of the flights was possible through these radio sets, despite the fact the Flitfires were not equipped with external antennas or shielded ignitions. [...] The Flitfire Brigade's New York landing was the largest mass landing ever attempted up to that time.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{interesting}} policy questions have arisen regarding airport <b>landing</b> <b>fees.</b> For example, {{what is the}} impact of joint ownership of airports? Does airline countervailing power stop airports raising fees? Should airports be prohibited, as an EU directive intends, from charging differential input prices to airlines? We set out a model of upstream airports and downstream airlines with varying countervailing power and pricing structures. Our major findings are: (a) an increase in upstream concentration or in the degree of differentiation between airports always increases the landing fee; (b) the effect of countervailing power, via an increase in downstream concentration, lowers <b>landing</b> <b>fees,</b> but typically does not pass through to consumers; (c) with Cournot competition, uniform <b>landing</b> <b>fees</b> are always higher than discriminatory fees...|$|R
