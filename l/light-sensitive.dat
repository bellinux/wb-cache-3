5|$|Many {{bivalves}} have no eyes, but a {{few members}} of the Arcoidea, Limopsoidea, Mytiloidea, Anomioidea, Ostreoidea, and Limoidea have simple eyes on the margin of the mantle. These consist of a pit of photosensory cells and a lens. Scallops have more complex eyes with a lens, a two-layered retina, and a concave mirror. All bivalves have <b>light-sensitive</b> cells that can detect a shadow falling over the animal.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescent {{organisms are}} {{a target for}} many areas of research. Luciferase systems are widely used in genetic {{engineering}} as reporter genes, each producing a different colour by fluorescence, and for biomedical research using bioluminescence imaging. For example, the firefly luciferase gene was used as early as 1986 for research using transgenic tobacco plants. Vibrio bacteria symbiose with marine invertebrates such as the Hawaiian bobtail squid (Euprymna scolopes), are key experimental models for bioluminescence. Bioluminescent activated destruction is an experimental cancer treatment. See also optogenetics which {{involves the use of}} light to control cells in living tissue, typically neurons, that have been genetically modified to express <b>light-sensitive</b> ion channels, and also see biophoton, a photon of non-thermal origin in the visible and ultraviolet spectrum emitted from a biological system.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} assumed to have been lost for many years until a paper copy was {{identified}} in 1968 in the Library of Congress Paper Print archive by Michael Pointer, a historian of Sherlock Holmes films. Because motion pictures were not covered by copyright laws until 1912, paper prints were submitted by studios wishing to register their works. These were made using <b>light-sensitive</b> paper of the same width and length as the film itself, and developed as though a still photograph. Both the Edison Company and the Biograph Company submitted entire motion pictures as paper prints, {{and it is in}} this form that most of them survive. The film has subsequently been transferred to 16 mm film in the Library of Congress collection.|$|E
5|$|An owl's {{eyes are}} {{placed at the}} front of the head and have a field overlap of 50–70%, giving it better {{binocular}} vision than diurnal birds of prey (overlap 30–50%). The tawny owl's retina has about 56,000 <b>light-sensitive</b> rod cells per square millimetre (36million per square inch); although earlier claims that it could see in the infrared part of the spectrum have been dismissed, it is still often said to have eyesight 10 to 100 times better than humans in low-light conditions. However, the experimental basis for this claim is probably inaccurate by at least a factor of 10. The owl's actual visual acuity is only slightly greater than that of humans, and any increased sensitivity is due to optical factors rather than to greater retinal sensitivity; both humans and owl have reached the limit of resolution for the retinas of terrestrial vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|The Museum {{building}} {{consists of}} a three-level base building that is {{closed to the public}} and provides staff workspace and storage areas. Five public, two-story towers on the base are called the North, East, South, West and the Exhibitions Pavilions. The Exhibitions Pavilion acts as the temporary residence for traveling art collections and the Foundation's artwork for which the permanent pavilions have no room. The permanent collection is displayed throughout the other four pavilions chronologically: the north houses the oldest art while the west houses the newest. The first-floor galleries in each pavilion house <b>light-sensitive</b> art, such as illuminated manuscripts, furniture, or photography. Computer-controlled skylights on the second-floor galleries allow paintings to be displayed in natural light. The second floors are connected by a series of glass-enclosed bridges and open terraces, both of which offer views of the surrounding hillsides and central plaza. Sculpture is also on display at various points outside the buildings, including on various terraces and balconies. The lower level (the highest of the floors in the base) includes a public cafeteria, the terrace cafe, and the photography galleries.|$|E

25|$|The hepatic porphyrias are {{characterized}} by acute neurological attacks (seizures, psychosis, extreme back and abdominal pain, and an acute polyneuropathy), while the erythropoietic forms present with skin problems, usually a <b>light-sensitive</b> blistering rash and increased hair growth.|$|E
25|$|Photography is the science, art, {{application}} {{and practice of}} creating durable images by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation, either electronically {{by means of an}} image sensor, or chemically by means of a <b>light-sensitive</b> material such as photographic film.|$|E
25|$|Carbon diselenide is an {{inorganic}} compound with the chemical formula CSe2. It is a yellow-orange oily liquid with pungent odor. It is an analogue of carbon disulfide (CS2). This <b>light-sensitive</b> compound is {{insoluble in water}} and soluble in organic solvents.|$|E
25|$|Some {{jellyfish}} have ocelli: <b>light-sensitive</b> organs that do {{not form}} images but which can detect light and are used to determine up from down, responding to sunlight shining on the water's surface. These are generally pigment spot ocelli, which have some cells (not all) pigmented.|$|E
25|$|Photographic plates, {{which had}} the <b>light-sensitive</b> {{emulsion}} coated on a thin sheet of glass, were normally used instead of flexible film, both because a general transition from glass plates to plastic film was still in progress and because glass provided the best dimensional stability for three images intended to match up perfectly when they were later combined.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{preparation}} of a simple, <b>light-sensitive</b> surface involves forming an emulsion of silver halide crystals in a gelatine, {{which is then}} coated onto a film or other support. The crystals are formed by precipitation in a controlled environment to produce small, uniform crystals (typically < 1 μm in diameter and containing ~1012 Ag atoms) called grains.|$|E
25|$|In mammals, light {{controls}} {{the sense of}} sight and the circadian clock by activating <b>light-sensitive</b> proteins in photoreceptor cells in the eye's retina. In the case of vision, light is detected by rhodopsin in rod and cone cells. In {{the case of the}} circadian clock, a different photopigment, melanopsin, is responsible for detecting light in intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells.|$|E
25|$|A {{phototransistor}} is a <b>light-sensitive</b> transistor. A {{common type}} of phototransistor, called a photobipolar transistor, is in essence a bipolar transistor encased in a transparent case so that light can reach the base–collector junction. It was invented by Dr. John N. Shive (more famous for his wave machine) at Bell Labs in 1948, {{but it was not}} announced until 1950. The electrons that are generated by photons in the base–collector junction are injected into the base, and this photodiode current is amplified by the transistor's current gain β (or hfe). If the base and collector leads are used and the emitter is left unconnected, the phototransistor becomes a photodiode. While phototransistors have a higher responsivity for light they are not able to detect low levels of light any better than photodiodes. Phototransistors also have significantly longer response times. Field-effect phototransistors, also known as photoFETs, are <b>light-sensitive</b> field-effect transistors. Unlike photobipolar transistors, photoFETs control drain-source current by creating a gate voltage.|$|E
25|$|G protein–coupled receptors {{are found}} only in eukaryotes, {{including}} yeast, choanoflagellates, and animals. The ligands that bind and activate these receptors include <b>light-sensitive</b> compounds, odors, pheromones, hormones, and neurotransmitters, and vary in size from small molecules to peptides to large proteins. G protein–coupled receptors are involved in many diseases, and are also the target of approximately 34% of all modern medicinal drugs.|$|E
25|$|The Museum {{is split}} into three {{galleries}} {{as of this}} date, The main gallery (housed above the old stables) contains many of the museum's small artifacts, as well as tablets of writing and mummy portraits and cases. Another gallery contains mainly pottery. The third and last is accessed via and along a stairwell. Some parts of the collection are not lit to protect <b>light-sensitive</b> items, and torches (flashlights) are supplied to see inside the cases.|$|E
25|$|Because Niépce's camera {{photographs}} {{required an}} extremely long exposure (at least eight hours and probably several days), {{he sought to}} greatly improve his bitumen process or replace it with one that was more practical. In partnership with Louis Daguerre, he worked out post-exposure processing methods that produced visually superior results and replaced the bitumen with a more <b>light-sensitive</b> resin, but hours of exposure in the camera were still required. With an eye to eventual commercial exploitation, the partners opted for total secrecy.|$|E
25|$|Owls {{have very}} large eyes for their size, 2.2 {{times greater than}} the average for birds of the same weight, and {{positioned}} {{at the front of the}} head. The eyes have a field overlap of 50–70%, giving better binocular vision than for diurnal birds of prey (overlap 30–50%). The tawny owl's retina has about 56,000 <b>light-sensitive</b> rods per square millimetre (36million per square inch); although earlier claims that it could see in the infrared part of the spectrum have been dismissed.|$|E
25|$|Alice {{apparently}} took university classes, {{including two}} years of law and three years of medicine. She was interested in chemistry, and became a skilled photographer, doing her own developing and platemaking. By 1890 she was publishing articles on the technique of photography in major photography magazines such as Wilson's Photographic Magazine and The International Annual of Anthony's Photographic Bulletin, as A. Lee Snelling and Alice Lee Snelling. These interests were shared by her son Walter, a chemist who later developed a <b>light-sensitive</b> coating for photographic paper using TNT.|$|E
25|$|Image acquisitionA {{digital image}} is {{produced}} by one or several image sensors, which, besides various types of <b>light-sensitive</b> cameras, include range sensors, tomography devices, radar, ultra-sonic cameras, etc. Depending {{on the type of}} sensor, the resulting image data is an ordinary 2D image, a 3D volume, or an image sequence. The pixel values typically correspond to light intensity in one or several spectral bands (gray images or colour images), but can also be related to various physical measures, such as depth, absorption or reflectance of sonic or electromagnetic waves, or nuclear magnetic resonance.|$|E
25|$|Using chloride-containing patch-clamp {{electrodes}} in 2006, spontaneous postsynaptic currents (PSCs) {{were recorded}} in about 30% of the CR cells in P0-P2 rat cerebral cortex. These sPSCs decreased to about 10% at P4, indicating that CR cells became functionally disconnected during further development. these sPSCs were reversibly blocked by bicuculline, a <b>light-sensitive</b> competitive antagonist of GABA-A receptors, suggesting activation of GABA-A receptors in these sPSCs. Moreover, the frequency and amplitude of these sPSCs was not influenced by tetrodotoxin, which inhibits the firing of action potentials in nerves, indicating that these sPSCs are independent on presynaptic action potentials.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, an {{abandoned}} F-18 hangar in Irvine California was sealed to create, in effect, a giant pinhole camera, and a panoramic {{print of the}} El Toro Air Station was formed on a <b>light-sensitive</b> muslin cloth measuring 111 feet wide, 32 feet high. Under the direction of Laguna Beach photographer Jacques Garnier, the image, known as “The Great Picture”, was originally produced {{as part of the}} Legacy Project - a photographic and historical record of the base before being transformed into what is now the Orange County Great Park. This {{is believed to be the}} largest photographic image ever taken by a camera.|$|E
25|$|These are {{extremely}} <b>light-sensitive</b> vacuum tubes with a photocathode coated onto part (an end or side) {{of the inside}} of the envelope. The photocathode contains combinations of materials such as caesium, rubidium and antimony specially selected to provide a low work function, so when illuminated even by very low levels of light, the photocathode readily releases electrons. By means of a series of electrodes (dynodes) at ever-higher potentials, these electrons are accelerated and substantially increased in number through secondary emission to provide a readily detectable output current. Photomultipliers are still commonly used wherever low levels of light must be detected.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people with}} Stickler {{syndrome}} are very nearsighted (described as having high myopia) {{because of the}} shape of the eye. People with eye involvement are prone to increased pressure within the eye (ocular hypertension) which could lead to glaucoma and tearing or detachment of the <b>light-sensitive</b> retina of the eye (retinal detachment). Cataract may also present as an ocular complication associated with Stickler's Syndrome. The jelly-like substance within the eye (the vitreous humour) has a distinctive appearance in the types of Stickler syndrome associated with the COL2A1 and COL11A1 genes. As a result, regular appointments to a specialist ophthalmologist are advised. The type of Stickler syndrome associated with the COL11A2 gene does not affect the eye.|$|E
25|$|The prosoma is {{the forward}} {{part of the}} body, it is {{actually}} composed of six segments {{fused together to form}} the head and the thorax. It contains the semicircular to subrectangular platelike carapace. On the dorsal side of the latter are two large crescent-shaped compound eyes. They also possessed two smaller <b>light-sensitive</b> simple eyes (the median ocelli) {{near the center of the}} carapace on a small elevation (known as the ocellar mound). Underneath the carapace is the mouth and six appendages, usually referred to in Roman numerals I-VI. Each appendage in turn is composed of nine segments (known as podomeres) labeled in Arabic numerals 1-9. The first segments which connect the appendages to the body are known as the coxa (plural coxae).|$|E
25|$|During a brief {{transitional}} period (c. 1950s–1990s), photographic technology, known as phototypesetting, utilized tiny high-resolution images of individual glyphs {{on a film}} strip (in {{the form of a}} film negative, with the letters as clear areas on an opaque black background). A high-intensity light source behind the film strip projected the image of each glyph through an optical system, which focused the desired letter onto the <b>light-sensitive</b> phototypesetting paper at a specific size and position. This photographic typesetting process permitted optical scaling, allowing designers to produce multiple sizes from a single font, although physical constraints on the reproduction system used still required design changes at different sizes; for example, ink traps and spikes to allow for spread of ink encountered in the printing stage. Manually operated photocomposition systems using fonts on filmstrips allowed fine kerning between letters without the physical effort of manual typesetting, and spawned an enlarged type design industry in the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E
25|$|By the 1900s {{printing}} plants often incorporated electrotyping and stereotyping departments, and electrotyping and stereotyping {{had become}} trades with associated apprenticeships. In the United Kingdom, the National Society of Electrotypers and Stereotypers (NSES) formed in 1893, {{and continued to}} 1967 when it amalgamated with the National Graphic Association. In the US and Canada, the International Stereotypers and Electrotypers Union (ISEU) was formed in 1902; previously, electrotypers had belonged to the International Typographer's Union (ITU). In 1925 there were 6800 members, and in 1955 10,500. In 1973 the ISEU was absorbed into the International Printing and Graphic Communications Union. In 1978, an Occupational Outlook Handbook reported that 2000 electrotypers and stereotypers were employed in the US. However, job prospects were reported as poor. Offset printing has supplanted letterpress printing in most printing plants; the last letterpress facility for a newspaper was installed in the 1980s. For offset printing, the printing plates are typically prepared by coating them with <b>light-sensitive</b> materials, and creating {{the image on the}} plate by direct optical exposure (the photo-offset process); stereotyping and electrotyping are not used.|$|E

Miniature sensors, a computer chip and a solar panel were fitted in a [...] "backpack" [...] over the insect's thorax in front of its wings. Light is sent down flexible light-pipes named optrodes from the backpack into the nerve cord to give steering commands to the insect.

500|$|Stebbins' {{early work}} with lizards in the {{southern}} California desert led {{to a series of}} papers from the 1950s through the 1970s exploring the parietal eye of reptiles (also called the [...] "third eye", a tiny <b>light-sensitive</b> organ on the forehead) and the associated pineal gland, both of which are now known to influence circadian rhythms. Aided by a Senior Postdoctoral Fellowship from the National Science Foundation, Stebbins and colleagues found that lizards with the parietal eye surgically removed changed their behavior: they became active much earlier in the day, spent more time in the sun, and remained active much later than control lizards. Further studies over the next few decades focused on the parietal eye of the tuatara, the pineal gland's effects on lizard reproductive behavior, and parietal skull openings in fossil [...] "mammal-like reptiles" [...] such as Lystrosaurus. His work had implications beyond reptile biology: Nobel laureate Julius Axelrod, after reading the work of Stebbins and others, began investigating the pineal gland in mammals, with emphasis on the effect of melatonin on activity cycles. Melatonin has since been found to influence human health. Stebbins was proud of his parietal and pineal work, calling it [...] "possibly the single piece of research which gives me the most satisfaction." ...|$|E
2500|$|Behe {{states that}} elucidations of the {{evolutionary}} history of various biological features typically assume {{the existence of}} certain abilities as their starting point, such as Charles Darwin's example of a cluster of <b>light-sensitive</b> spots evolving into an eye via a series of intermediate steps.
