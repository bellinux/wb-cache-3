5|$|Medical {{conditions}} that inhibit consciousness are considered disorders of consciousness. This category generally includes minimally conscious state and persistent vegetative state, but sometimes {{also includes the}} less severe <b>locked-in</b> <b>syndrome</b> and more severe chronic coma. Differential diagnosis of these disorders is an active area of biomedical research. Finally, brain death results in an irreversible disruption of consciousness. While other conditions may cause a moderate deterioration (e.g., dementia and delirium) or transient interruption (e.g., grand mal and petit mal seizures) of consciousness, they {{are not included in}} this category.|$|E
5|$|Strokes {{that occur}} in the {{brainstem}} may cause profound deficits, including <b>locked-in</b> <b>syndrome,</b> in which cognitive, emotional and linguistic abilities remain intact but all or almost all voluntary motor abilities are lost. Most people affected by this type of stroke rely on AAC strategies to communicate, since few recover intelligible speech or functional voice. The AAC strategies used vary with the individual's preferences and motor capabilities which may change over time. As eye movements {{are most likely to be}} preserved, eye blinks are frequently used for communication. Low-tech alphabet boards are often introduced immediately to provide the individual with basic communication. Partner-assisted scanning may be used, in which the AAC user signals when the desired letter is named by a communication partner. When vertical and horizontal eye movements are functional, a transparent alphabet board may be used in which the AAC user looks at the desired letter and this is acknowledged by the communication partner. Individuals with <b>locked-in</b> <b>syndrome</b> have difficulty using high-tech devices due to issues with motor control, vision, memory, alertness and linguistic ability. In particular, a voluntary, reliable and easily controlled muscle movement is necessary to access such a device, such as head, jaw, hand or finger movements. In some individuals, intensive practice, even long after the initial stroke, has been shown to increase the accuracy and consistency of head movements, which can be used to access a communication device.|$|E
5|$|From the 1980s, {{improvements}} in technology {{led to a}} greatly increased number, variety, and performance of commercially available communication devices, {{and a reduction in}} their size and price. Alternative methods of access such eye pointing or scanning became available on communication devices. Speech output possibilities included digitized and synthesized speech, with text-to-speech options available in German, French, Italian, Spanish, Swedish and Ewe. AAC services became more holistic, seeking to develop a balance of aided and unaided strategies with the goal of improving functioning in the person's daily life, and greater involvement of the family. Increasingly, individuals with acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, head injury, and <b>locked-in</b> <b>syndrome,</b> received AAC services. In addition, with the challenge to the notion of AAC prerequisites, those with severe to profound intellectual impairments began to be served. Courses on AAC were developed for professional training programs, and literature such as textbooks and guides were written to support students, clinicians and parents.|$|E

50|$|In <b>locked-in</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{the patient}} has awareness, sleep-wake cycles, and {{meaningful}} behavior (viz., eye-movement), but is isolated due to quadriplegia and pseudobulbar palsy, resulting from the disruption of corticospinal and corticobulbar pathways. <b>Locked-in</b> <b>syndrome</b> is {{a condition in which}} a patient is aware and awake but cannot move or communicate verbally due to complete paralysis of nearly all voluntary muscles in the body except for the eyes. Eye or eyelid movements are the main method of communication. Total <b>locked-in</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a version of <b>locked-in</b> <b>syndrome</b> where the eyes are paralyzed as well.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Locked-in</b> <b>syndrome</b> (LIS) is a {{condition}} in which a patient is aware but cannot move or communicate verbally due to complete paralysis of nearly all voluntary muscles in the body except for vertical eye movements and blinking. The individual is conscious and sufficiently intact cognitively to be able to communicate with eye movements. The EEG is normal in locked-in syndrome.Total <b>locked-in</b> <b>syndrome,</b> or completely locked-in state (CLIS), is a version of <b>locked-in</b> <b>syndrome</b> wherein the eyes are paralyzed as well.

5000|$|<b>Locked-in</b> <b>syndrome</b> usually {{results from}} {{quadriplegia}} {{and the inability}} to speak in otherwise cognitively intact individuals. Those with <b>locked-in</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{may be able to}} communicate with others through coded messages by blinking or moving their eyes, which are often not affected by the paralysis. The symptoms {{are similar to those of}} sleep paralysis. Patients who have <b>locked-in</b> <b>syndrome</b> are conscious and aware, with no loss of cognitive function. They can sometimes retain proprioception and sensation throughout their bodies. Some patients may have the ability to move certain facial muscles, and most often some or all of the extraocular muscles. Individuals with the syndrome lack coordination between breathing and voice. [...] This prevents them producing voluntary sounds, though the vocal cords are not paralysed.|$|E

50|$|Akinetic mutism can be misdiagnosed as depression, delirium, or <b>locked-in</b> <b>syndrome,</b> all {{of which}} are common {{following}} a stroke. Patients with depression can experience apathy, slurring of speech, and body movements similar to akinetic mutism. Similarly to akinetic mutism, patients with <b>locked-in</b> <b>syndrome</b> experience paralysis and can only communicate with their eyes. Correct diagnosis is important to ensure proper treatment. A variety of treatments for akinetic mutism have been documented, but treatments vary between patients and cases.|$|E

50|$|<b>Locked-in</b> <b>syndrome</b> can be {{difficult}} to diagnose. In a 2002 survey of 44 LIS patients, it took almost 3 months to recognize and diagnose LIS after the patient had suffered the incident (i.e., a stroke or an injury) that had caused his/her LIS. <b>Locked-in</b> <b>syndrome</b> may mimic loss of consciousness in patients, or, in the case that respiratory control is lost, may even resemble death. Patients are also unable to actuate standard motor responses such as withdrawal from pain; as a result, testing often requires making requests of the patient such as blinking or vertical eye movement.|$|E
