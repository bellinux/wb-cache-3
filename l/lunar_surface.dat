5|$|After {{being sent}} toward the Moon by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts {{separated}} the spacecraft {{from it and}} traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the lunar module Eagle and landed in the Sea of Tranquility. They stayed {{a total of about}} 21.5 hours on the <b>lunar</b> <b>surface.</b> The astronauts used Eagles upper stage to lift off from the <b>lunar</b> <b>surface</b> and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that blasted them out of lunar orbit on a trajectory back to Earth. They returned to Earth and landed in the Pacific Ocean on July 24.|$|E
5|$|Apollo 16 was {{the second}} of the Apollo type J missions, {{featuring}} the use of the Lunar Roving Vehicle, increased scientific capability, and <b>lunar</b> <b>surface</b> stays of three days. As Apollo 16 was the penultimate mission in the Apollo program and there was no new hardware or procedures to test on the <b>lunar</b> <b>surface,</b> the last two missions (the other being Apollo 17) presented opportunities for astronauts to clear up some uncertainties in understanding the Moon's properties. Although previous Apollo expeditions, including Apollo 14 and Apollo 15, obtained samples of pre-mare lunar material, before lava began to upwell from the Moon's interior and flood the low areas and basins, none had actually visited the lunar highlands.|$|E
5|$|The European {{spacecraft}} SMART-1, {{the second}} ion-propelled spacecraft, was in lunar orbit from 15 November 2004 until its lunar impact on 3 September 2006, {{and made the}} first detailed survey of chemical elements on the <b>lunar</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
50|$|He {{started his}} career working for the US Geological Survey and later joined NASA as a senior science member. He was {{responsible}} for investigation of planetary and <b>lunar</b> <b>surfaces,</b> being interested in finding scientifically valuable landing places. This included the Apollo and Viking missions.|$|R
40|$|Summary Block abundances around {{lunar craters}} are {{measured}} on LROC images and compared with CPR values {{derived from the}} Mini-RF SAR images. CPR tends to increase with increasing blockiness, but the correlation is not simple. Introduction A major objective of the Mini-RF experiment is to distinguish <b>lunar</b> <b>surfaces</b> that may contain water/ice deposits [1, 2]. Better understanding of the backscattering properties of craters of varying age and size is crucial fo...|$|R
40|$|The metric and {{panoramic}} cameras {{aboard the}} Apollo 16 spacecraft provided photographs on which photogrammetric techniques {{may be used}} to obtain precise measurements of horizontal distances and elevations. It is reported that these measurements may in turn be used to obtain slope-frequency distributions of <b>lunar</b> <b>surfaces</b> at various slope lengths and for various types of terrain and geologic map units. Bistatic radar and photoclinometric methods were also used to obtain the same data...|$|R
5|$|The NASA Constellation Program {{announced}} Altair as {{the name}} of the <b>Lunar</b> <b>Surface</b> Access Module (LSAM) on December 13, 2007. The Russian-made Beriev Be-200 Altair seaplane is also named after the star.|$|E
5|$|Einsteinium-254 {{was used}} as the {{calibration}} marker in the chemical analysis spectrometer ("alpha-scattering surface analyzer") of the Surveyor 5 lunar probe. The large mass of this isotope reduced the spectral overlap between signals from the marker and the studied lighter elements of the <b>lunar</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
5|$|Faget's {{preliminary}} Apollo design {{employed a}} cone-shaped command module, supported {{by one of}} several service modules providing propulsion and electrical power, sized appropriately for the space station, cislunar, and lunar landing missions. Once Kennedy's Moon landing goal became official, detailed design began of a Command/Service Module (CSM) in which the crew would spend the entire direct-ascent mission and lift off from the <b>lunar</b> <b>surface</b> for the return trip, after being soft-landed by a larger landing propulsion module. The final choice of lunar orbit rendezvous changed the CSM's role to the translunar ferry used to transport the crew, along with a new spacecraft, the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM, later shortened to Lunar Module, LM) which would take two men to the <b>lunar</b> <b>surface</b> and return them to the CSM.|$|E
40|$|Requirements and {{constraints}} of food processing in space include a balanced diet, food variety, stability for storage, hardware weight and volume, plant performance, build-up of microorganisms, and waste processing. Lunar, Martian, and space station environmental conditions include variations in atmosphere, day length, temperature, gravity, magnetic field, and radiation environment. Weightlessness affects fluid behavior, heat transfer, and mass transfer. Concerns about microbial behavior include survival on Martian and <b>lunar</b> <b>surfaces</b> and in enclosed environments. Many present technologies {{can be adapted}} to meet space conditions...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} will outline {{a proposed}} mission for the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO). The mission outlined {{will concentrate on}} an examination of Europa. Some of the primary science goals for the JIMO mission are: 1) to answer broad science questions, 2) improved knowledge of Jovian system; specifically, lunar geological and geophysical properties, 3) chemical composition of Jovian <b>lunar</b> <b>surfaces</b> and subterranean matter, and 4) the search for life. In order to address these issues, the experiment proposed here will deploy orbiting, surface, and subterranean science platforms...|$|R
40|$|Data are {{presented}} concerning the energy spectra of solar flare particles {{and the distribution}} of particles producing submicron diameter craters. Processes which alter the albedo and possibly the chemistry of exposed <b>lunar</b> <b>surfaces</b> are also considered. Measurements are reported of solar flare track gradients in rock 64455 which is sufficiently young to have uneroded surfaces on its sides. Attention is also given to accretionary particles adhering to host surfaces, microcraters on soil particles, and microcraters on the oriented surfaces of sample 76015 from a boulder at Station 6 of the Apollo 17 site...|$|R
5|$|<b>Lunar</b> <b>Surface</b> Rendezvous: Two {{spacecraft}} {{would be}} launched in succession. The first, an automated vehicle carrying propellant {{for the return}} to Earth, would land on the Moon, to be followed some time later by the manned vehicle. Propellant {{would have to be}} transferred from the automated vehicle to the manned vehicle.|$|E
5|$|The Gemini <b>Lunar</b> <b>Surface</b> Rescue Spacecraft was {{intended}} to fly a direct ascent mission, launched by a Saturn V. Descent stages, built from either the descent stage of the Apollo Lunar Module, or from the Apollo Service Module, would have reduced the spacecraft's velocity as it approached the Moon. One configuration used two Service Modules and one LEM descent stage, with the LEM descent stage performing the final landing, and then being reused for ascent from the <b>Lunar</b> <b>surface</b> and trans-Earth injection. The other configuration used three LEM descent stages, with the second being used for landing and the third for ascent and TEI. The LSRS would have landed close to the Apollo Lunar Module on the Moon, and the Apollo crew would have transferred to it by EVA.|$|E
5|$|The twin Voyager {{spacecraft}} {{were launched}} in 1977, each containing a 500 watt plutonium power source. Over 30 years later, each source is still producing about 300 watts which allows limited operation of each spacecraft. An {{earlier version of}} the same technology powered five Apollo <b>Lunar</b> <b>Surface</b> Experiment Packages, starting with Apollo 12 in 1969.|$|E
40|$|An instrumentation, called Space Active Modular Materials ExperimentS (SAMMES), is {{developed}} for monitoring the spacecraft environment and for accurately measuring {{the degradation of}} space materials in low earth orbit (LEO). The SAMMES architecture concept can be extended to instrumentation for planetary exploration, both on spacecraft and in situ. The operating environment for planetary application will be substantially different, with temperature extremes and harsh solar wind and cosmic ray flux on <b>lunar</b> <b>surfaces</b> and temperature extremes and high winds on venusian and Martian surfaces. Moreover, instruments for surface deployment, which will be packaged in a small lander/rover (as in MESUR, for example), must be extremely compact with ultralow power and weight. With these requirements in mind, the SAMMES concept was extended to a sensor/instrumentation scheme for the <b>lunar</b> and Martian <b>surface</b> environment...|$|R
40|$|During the Clementine 1 mission, a {{bistatic}} radar experiment {{measured the}} magnitude and polarization of the radar echo versus bistatic angle, beta, for selected lunar areas. Observations of the lunar south pole yield a same-sense polarization enhancement around beta = 0. Analysis shows that the observed enhancement is localized to the permanently shadowed regions of the lunar south pole. Radar observations of periodically solar-illuminated <b>lunar</b> <b>surfaces,</b> including the north pole, yielded no such enhancement. A probable explanation for these differences {{is the presence of}} low-loss volume scatterers, such as water ice, in the permanently shadowed region at the south pole...|$|R
40|$|The {{network of}} seismometers {{installed}} by the Apollo 17 and other Apollo missions is described. The {{effects of the}} impacts of lunar modules and S- 4 B stages on the <b>lunar</b> <b>surfaces</b> are discussed. The information concerning lunar composition which is obtained by analyzing the seismic signals generated by moonquakes and meteoroid impacts are analyzed. It is concluded that the seismic activity within the moon is extremely low compared to that with the earth. The moon {{is characterized by a}} rigid, dynamically inactive outer shell, approximately 1000 kilometers thick, surrounding a core that has markedly different elastic properties...|$|R
5|$|A ten-member {{team led}} by Leonard Reiffel was {{assembled}} at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago to study the potential visibility of the explosion, benefits to science, and implications for the <b>lunar</b> <b>surface.</b> Among {{the members of the}} research team were astronomer Gerard Kuiper and his doctoral student Carl Sagan, who was responsible for the mathematical projection of the expansion of a dust cloud in space around the Moon, an essential element in determining its visibility from Earth.|$|E
5|$|Apollo Robbins medallions {{were also}} struck, in very small numbers, in 14k gold. These medallions were {{generally}} {{ordered by the}} mission crew as a personal memento of their flight and were often taken to the <b>lunar</b> <b>surface</b> in the Landing Module. For {{the duration of the}} Apollo program, Robbins medallions (3–7 gold and 80–450 silver per mission) were flown into space.|$|E
5|$|India's first lunar mission, Chandrayaan I, orbited from 8 November 2008 until loss {{of contact}} on 27 August 2009, {{creating}} a high resolution chemical, mineralogical and photo-geological {{map of the}} <b>lunar</b> <b>surface,</b> and confirming the presence of water molecules in lunar soil. The Indian Space Research Organisation planned to launch Chandrayaan II in 2013, which would have included a Russian robotic lunar rover. However, the failure of Russia's Fobos-Grunt mission has delayed this project.|$|E
40|$|High-explosive {{charges are}} used to form, in several types of {{granular}} media, laboratory-scale examples of the bowl-shaped craters that {{are found to be}} the largest and simplest class of impact structure on planetary and <b>lunar</b> <b>surfaces.</b> High-speed films of the experiments yield crater growth rate and particle displacement data, including quantitative stress, strain, displacement, and velocity data. These results are compared with the particle displacement and velocity data from large explosion experiments which have produced bowl-shaped craters. A time-sequence description of large, bowl-shaped impact crater formation is developed from the results of these comparisons, {{as well as those of}} the morphological features and structural deformations of large explosions and impact craters...|$|R
50|$|The {{hypothetical}} {{mechanism of}} water transport / trapping (if any) remains unknown: indeed <b>lunar</b> <b>surfaces</b> directly {{exposed to the}} solar wind where water production occurs are too hot to allow trapping by water condensation (and solar radiation also continuously decomposes water), while no (or much less) water production is expected in the cold areas not directly exposed to the Sun. Given the expected short lifetime of water molecules in illuminated regions, a short transport distance would in principle increase the probability of trapping. In other words, water molecules produced close to a cold, dark polar crater should have the highest probability of surviving and being trapped.|$|R
40|$|By mid- 19 th century, astronomers {{strongly}} {{suspected that}} the Moon was largely dry and airless, based on {{the absence of any}} observable weather. In 1892, William H. Pickering made a series of careful occultation measurements that allowed him to conclude that the <b>lunar</b> <b>surface's</b> atmospheric pressure was less than 1 / 4000 th of Earth's. Any number of strange ideas arose to contradict this. Respectable scientists realized that significant amounts of water on the Moon's surface would rapidly sublime into the vacuum. Since 2007, however, the field has started another revolution in thought, and we describe this, including some lesser known aspects. Comment: 34 pages, 6 figures included in PDF fil...|$|R
5|$|Kennedy's {{goal was}} {{accomplished}} on the Apollo 11 mission when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed their Lunar Module (LM) on July 20, 1969, and {{walked on the}} <b>lunar</b> <b>surface,</b> while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the Command/Service Module (CSM), and all three landed safely on Earth on July 24. Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed astronauts on the Moon, the last in December 1972. In these six spaceflights, twelve men walked on the Moon.|$|E
5|$|The first {{scenes of}} {{dialogue}} are Floyd's encounters {{on the space}} station: chit-chat with the colleague who greets him, his telephone call to his daughter, and the friendly but strained encounter with Soviet scientists. Later, {{en route to the}} monolith, Floyd engages in trite exchanges with his staff while a spectacular journey by Earth-light across the <b>Lunar</b> <b>surface</b> is shown. Hal is the only character who expresses anxiety, as well as feelings of pride and bewilderment.|$|E
5|$|A {{range of}} {{applications}} were considered for Advanced Gemini missions, including military flights, space station crew and logistics delivery, and lunar flights. The Lunar proposals ranged from reusing the docking systems {{developed for the}} Agena target vehicle on more powerful upper stages such as the Centaur, which could propel the spacecraft to the Moon, to complete modifications of the Gemini to enable it {{to land on the}} <b>Lunar</b> <b>surface.</b> Its applications would have ranged from manned lunar flybys before Apollo was ready, to providing emergency shelters or rescue for stranded Apollo crews, or even replacing the Apollo program.|$|E
30|$|After {{this first}} proposal, the {{possible}} existence of self-secondaries on the continuous ejecta deposits of impact craters was basically neglected. A major {{reason is that}} high-resolution images that could resolve sub-hundred-meter diameter craters have been limited. The successful insertion of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (i.e., LRO) into the Moon’s orbit in 2009 enabled the LROC narrow angle camera (i.e., NAC) to obtain high-resolution images as good as ~[*] 0.5  m/pixel for <b>lunar</b> <b>surfaces</b> (Robinson et al. 2010). At {{the time of this}} writing, LRO is still operating, and LROC NAC has acquired images for over 90 % of the entire Moon with a substantial portion been repeatedly imaged (e.g., Speyerer et al. 2016).|$|R

40|$|A Monte Carlo {{model of}} lunar megaregolith {{development}} is proposed. Minimum megaregolith depths are {{obtained in the}} preliminary model. The model impacts a gridded, initially flat surface area randomly, with points not constrained to grid intersections. Information is recorded at grid points on evolving topography, deepest depth impacted to, and number of hits at that location. Two types of <b>lunar</b> <b>surfaces</b> ar simulated, maria and highlands. Crater production functions are after run to densities that are multiples of observed lunar crater densities for craters of 8 km in diameter and larger. all craters are considered to have formed in a gravity scaled regime. Edge effect problems are corrected in this model by allowing craters forming outside the grid area or along its edges to effect the gridded area...|$|R
5|$|Armstrong's {{second and}} last spaceflight was as {{commander}} of Apollo 11, the first manned Moon landing mission in July 1969. Armstrong and Lunar Module pilot Buzz Aldrin descended to the <b>lunar</b> <b>surface</b> and spent {{two and a}} half hours outside the spacecraft, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the Command/Service Module. Along with Collins and Aldrin, Armstrong was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard Nixon. President Jimmy Carter presented Armstrong the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978. Armstrong and his former crewmates received the Congressional Gold Medal in 2009.|$|E
5|$|At 02:39 UTC on Monday July 21, 1969, Armstrong {{opened the}} hatch, and at 02:51 UTC began his descent to the <b>lunar</b> <b>surface.</b> The Remote Control Unit {{controls}} {{on his chest}} kept him from seeing his feet. Climbing down the nine-rung ladder, Armstrong pulled a D-ring to deploy the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA) folded against Eagle side and activate the TV camera, and at 02:56:15 UTC he set his left foot on the surface. The first landing used slow-scan television incompatible with commercial TV, so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor, significantly reducing {{the quality of the}} picture. The signal was received at Goldstone in the United States but with better fidelity by Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station in Australia. Minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive Parkes radio telescope in Australia. Despite some technical and weather difficulties, ghostly black and white images of the first lunar EVA were received and broadcast to at least 600 million people on Earth. Although copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available, recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the <b>lunar</b> <b>surface</b> were accidentally destroyed during routine magnetic tape re-use at NASA.|$|E
5|$|Following the Apollo 1 fire in January 1967, NASA {{conducted}} a safety {{review of the}} Apollo program. In response to this review, McDonnell proposed the Universal Lunar Rescue Vehicle, a repackaged version of the <b>Lunar</b> <b>Surface</b> Rescue Spacecraft with an enlarged capsule {{to make room for}} the three astronauts who were being rescued. It was intended to rescue an Apollo crew at almost any point whilst they were at the Moon, should an anomaly occur. Some ULRV designs included five seats, with two astronauts piloting it to the Moon. The proposal was considered, but rejected due to lack of funds.|$|E
40|$|The NASA Electronic Parts and Packaging (NEPP) Program Sensor Technology Commercial Sensor Survey task {{is geared}} toward benefiting future NASA space {{missions}} with low-cost, short-duty-cycle, visible imaging needs. Such applications could include imaging for educational outreach purposes or short surveys of spacecraft, planetary, or <b>lunar</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Under the task, inexpensive commercial grade CMOS sensors were surveyed in fiscal year 2007 (FY 07) and three sensors were selected for total ionizing dose (TID) and displacement damage dose (DDD) tolerance testing. The selected sensors had to meet selection criteria chosen to support small, low-mass cameras that produce good resolution color images. These criteria are discussed in detail in [1].

40|$|Regions of the Enceladus surface {{are shown}} by high {{resolution}} Voyager II images {{to be highly}} cratered, as if by heavy bombardment, with crater forms {{similar to those of}} fresh <b>lunar</b> <b>surfaces</b> but often shallower in depth. The flattening of these craters and the bowing up of their floors indicate viscous relaxation of the topography. Viscosity {{at the top of the}} lithosphere is suggested by crater form analysis to lie between 10 to the 24 th and 10 to the 25 th P.
