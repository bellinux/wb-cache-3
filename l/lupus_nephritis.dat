40|$|Immune {{mediated}} nephropathy {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious manifestations of lupus and is characterized by severe inflammation and necrosis that, if untreated, eventually leads to renal failure. Although lupus has a higher incidence in women, both sexes can develop <b>lupus</b> glomerulonephritis; <b>nephritis</b> in men develops earlier and is more severe than in women. It is therefore important to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating nephritis in each sex. Previous work by our lab found that the absence or pharmacological inhibition of Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP- 1), an enzyme involved in DNA repair and necrotic cell death, affects only male mice and results in milder nephritis, with less in situ inflammation, and diminished incidence of necrotic lesions, allowing for higher survival rates. A second pathway mediating necrosis involves Receptor-Interacting Serine-Threonine Kinase 3 (RIPK 3); in this study we sought to investigate the impact of RIPK 3 on the development of <b>lupus</b> and <b>nephritis</b> in both sexes. To this end, we used two inducible murine models of lupus: chronic graft versus host disease (cGvHD) and pristane-induced lupus; and nephrotoxic serum (NTS) -induced nephritis as a model of immune mediated nephropathy. We found that the absence of RIPK 3 has neither positive nor negative impact on the disease development or progression of <b>lupus</b> and <b>nephritis</b> in all three models, and in both male and female mice. We conclude that RIPK 3 is dispensable for the pathogenesis of lupus and immune mediated nephropathy as to accelerate, worsen or ameliorate the disease...|$|R

25|$|Anti-double {{stranded}} DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies {{are highly}} associated with SLE. They {{are a very}} specific marker for the disease, with some studies quoting nearly 100%. Data on sensitivity ranges from 25–85%. Anti-dsDNA antibody levels, known as titres, correlate with disease activity in SLE; high levels indicate more active lupus. The presence of anti-dsDNA antibodies is also linked with <b>lupus</b> <b>nephritis</b> and there is evidence they are the cause. Some anti-dsDNA antibodies are cross reactive with other antigens found on {{the glomerular basement membrane}} (GBM) of the kidney, such as heparan sulphate, collagen IV, fibronectin and laminin. Binding to these antigens within the kidney could cause inflammation and complement fixation, resulting in kidney damage. Presence of high DNA-binding and low C3 levels have been shown to have extremely high predictive value (94%) for the diagnosis of SLE. It is also possible that the anti-dsDNA antibodies are internalised by cells when they bind membrane antigens and then are displayed on the cell surface. This could promote inflammatory responses by T-cells within the kidney. It {{is important to note that}} not all anti-dsDNA antibodies are associated with <b>lupus</b> <b>nephritis</b> and that other factors can cause this symptom in their absence.

25|$|Some {{chemotherapy}} {{drugs are}} used in diseases other than cancer, such as in autoimmune disorders, and noncancerous plasma cell dyscrasia. In some cases they are often used at lower doses, {{which means that the}} side effects are minimized, while in other cases doses similar to ones used to treat cancer are used. Methotrexate is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis and multiple sclerosis. The anti-inflammatory response seen in RA is thought to be due to increases in adenosine, which causes immunosuppression; effects on immuno-regulatory cyclooxygenase-2 enzyme pathways; reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines; and anti-proliferative properties. Although methotrexate is used to treat both multiple sclerosis and ankylosing spondylitis, its efficacy in these diseases is still uncertain. Cyclophosphamide is sometimes used to treat <b>lupus</b> <b>nephritis,</b> a common symptom of systemic lupus erythematosus. Dexamethasone along with either bortezomib or melphalan is commonly used as a treatment for AL amyloidosis. Recently, bortezomid in combination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone has also shown promise as a treatment for AL amyloidosis. Other drugs used to treat myeloma such as lenalidomide have shown promise in treating AL amyloidosis.|$|E

40|$|Copyright © 2014 by the American College of Rheumatology. Objective Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE) {{has one of}} the highest hospital readmission rates among chronic conditions. This study was undertaken to identify patient-level, hospital-level, and geographic predictors of 30 -day hospital readmissions associated with SLE. Methods Using hospital discharge databases from 5 geographically dispersed states, we studied all-cause readmission of SLE patients between 2008 and 2009. We evaluated each hospitalization as a possible index event leading up to a readmission, our primary outcome. We accounted for clustering of hospitalizations within patients and within hospitals and adjusted for hospital case mix. Using multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression, we examined factors associated with 30 -day readmission and calculated risk-standardized hospital-level and state-level readmission rates. Results We examined 55, 936 hospitalizations among 31, 903 patients with SLE. Of these hospitalizations, 9, 244 (16. 5 %) resulted in readmission within 30 days. In adjusted analyses, age was inversely related to risk of readmission. African American and Hispanic patients were more likely to be readmitted than white patients, as were those with Medicare or Medicaid insurance (versus private insurance). Several clinical characteristics of <b>lupus,</b> including <b>nephritis,</b> serositis, and thrombocytopenia, were associated with readmission. Readmission rates varied significantly between hospitals after accounting for patient-level clustering and hospital case mix. We also found geographic variation, with risk-adjusted readmission rates lower in New York and higher in Florida as compared to California. Conclusion We found that ∼ 1 in 6 hospitalized patients with SLE were readmitted within 30 days of discharge, with higher rates among historically underserved populations. Significant geographic and hospital-level variation in risk-adjusted readmission rates suggests potential for quality improvement...|$|R
40|$|A novel interleukin- 8 {{polymorphism}} {{is associated}} with severe systemic <b>lupus</b> erythematosus <b>nephritis.</b> BackgroundInterleukin- 8 (IL- 8) is a potent neutrophil chemokine that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of renal inflammation in human glomerulonephritis. To explain inter-patient variations in renal inflammation during diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), it was postulated that the promoter region of the IL- 8 gene contains polymorphic residues that influence the level of IL- 8 expression in response to immune-complex deposition, and thereby affect the severity of renal injury. This study was undertaken to identify polymorphisms in the 5 ′-flanking region of the IL- 8 gene that correlate with the severity of SLE nephritis. MethodsA 1526 base pair segment of the IL- 8 5 ′-flanking region was PCR amplified from the genomic DNA of 100 individuals and sequenced on an automated capillary electrophoresis system. Sequence data were compared with the published IL- 8 sequence to identify polymorphisms. Allelic variations were verified by cloning and re-sequencing, and also by restriction enzyme analysis. Patients with SLE nephritis were genotyped for IL- 8 polymorphisms, and associations between specific alleles and severity of SLE nephritis [based on the World Health Organization (WHO) classification] were determined. ResultsThree single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in the IL- 8 flanking region. Labeled relative to the IL- 8 translational start site, these are T- 845 C, T- 738 A, and A- 353 T. T- 845 C and T- 738 A are novel, and found primarily in African Americans. The C for T change at position - 845 {{was found to be}} 3. 6 to 7. 5 times more frequent in African Americans with severe (WHO Class IV) SLE nephritis, than in African American controls, or patients with less severe forms of SLE nephritis, respectively. ConclusionsIL- 8 - 845 C might predispose African Americans with SLE nephritis to more severe renal injury, perhaps by influencing IL- 8 expression. Genotyping patients with glomerulonephritis for IL- 8 polymorphisms may be useful in predicting disease outcome and individualizing immunosuppressive therapy...|$|R

A preliminary proteomic evaluation of urine for biomarkers of systemic <b>lupus</b> erythematosus (SLE) <b>nephritis</b> demonstrated {{high levels of}} adiponectin in SLE urine. This prompted investigation of adiponectin expression in human SLE. MethodsAdiponectin was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the urine and plasma of a clinically well-characterized SLE cohort, with renal and nonrenal SLE being followed in a prospective longitudinal study to identify risk factors for SLE flare. Renal adiponectin expression was assessed by immunohistochemical analysis of kidney biopsies from SLE nephritis patients. ResultsCross-sectional testing showed that plasma adiponectin levels were higher in patients with renal SLE flare than normal controls or patients with nonrenal SLE flare, after accounting for race and body mass index. Urine adiponectin levels increased significantly with renal flare, but not nonrenal SLE flare. Longitudinal testing revealed that the urine adiponectin increase began in the 2 months prior to renal flare. Urine adiponectin correlated with plasma levels and magnitude of proteinuria, {{and to a lesser}} extent serum creatinine. Plasma adiponectin levels were independent of renal function and proteinuria. In kidney biopsies, adiponectin was found on endothelial surfaces in normal and SLE kidneys, and on podocytes and in the tubules of SLE kidneys.
