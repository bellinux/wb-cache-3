50|$|A <b>latex</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>test,</b> {{also called}} a latex {{agglutination}} assay or test (LA assay or test), is an assay used clinically {{in the identification}} and typing of many important microorganisms. These tests use the patient's antigen-antibody immune response. This response occurs when the body detects a pathogen and forms an antibody specific to an identified antigen (a protein configuration) present {{on the surface of}} the pathogen.|$|E
50|$|In medical tests, {{including}} rapid diagnostic tests, cross-reactivity can {{be either}} confounding or helpful, depending on the instance. An example of confounding that yields a false positive error is in a <b>latex</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>test</b> when agglutination occurs with another antigen rather than the antigen of interest. An example of helpful cross-reactivity is in heterophile antibody tests, which detect Epstein-Barr virus using antibodies that grew for other antigens. Cross-reactivity is also a commonly evaluated parameter for the validation of immune and protein binding based assays such as ELISA and RIA. In this case it is normally quantified by comparing the assays response {{to a range of}} similar analytes and expressed as a percentage. In practice, calibration curves are produced using fixed concentration ranges for a selection of related compounds and the midpoints (IC50) of the calibration curves are calculated and compared. The figure then provides an estimate of the response of the assay to possible interfering compounds relative to the target analyte.|$|E

In the patients with rheumatoid arthritis the frequency of rheumatoid factor was comparable to that reported in series from Europe and the USA, thus differing from the findings in West Africa. In the control patients and blood donors a high frequency of positive tests for rheumatoid factor was found; a similar result has been obtained from population studies in other African countries.

40|$|The {{rheumatoid}} factor, a {{group of}} unusual macroglobulins, is demonstrable in the serum {{of the majority of}} patients with rheumatoid arthritis and in a relatively small proportion of patients with other diseases (1).

The reactive component of "y-globulin seems to be an aggregate (5) with high sedimentation coefficients, which forms an insoluble complex with the rheumatoid factor. The origin and site of production of the rheumatoid factor has been unknown. In the present study, fluorescein-labelled aggregated human 7 -globulin was used as a specific reagent for its detection in situ.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the diagnostic and}} prognostic test qualities of the enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for rheumatoid factor isotypes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and to compare them with the <b>latex</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>test.</b> METHODS: Rheumatoid factor tests were performed in 1988 consecutive new rheumatology outpatients within two months after their {{first visit to the}} outpatient clinic of the Department of Rheumatology of Leiden University hospital. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and predictive values of the tests in discriminating RA from non-rheumatoid arthritis and erosive from non-erosive disease after two years of follow up were determined and presented as receiver operating characteristic curves and post-test probability curves. RESULTS: The sensitivity of the ELISA for IgG, IgA, and IgM rheumatoid factor for RA versus all controls at optimal cut off titres was 72 %, 44 %, and 69 %, respectively; the specificity was 52 %, 84 %, and 86 %. For the <b>latex</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>test</b> the sensitivity was 66 % and the specificity 91 %. The post-test probability of RA, at a clinical prevalence rate of 12 %, given a positive test result in the ELISAs for IgG, IgA, and IgM rheumatoid factor and the <b>latex</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>test,</b> was 17 %, 27 %, 40 %, and 49 %, respectively; with negative test results the probability was 7 %, 8 %, 5 %, and 5 %, respectively. The specificity of all tests in discriminating erosive from non-erosive RA at two years was low: 41 %, 44 %, 47 %, and 58 % for the ELISAs for IgG, IgA, and IgM rheumatoid factor and the <b>latex</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>test,</b> respectively. CONCLUSION: The ELISAs for IgG and IgA rheumatoid factor are of no significance in diagnosing RA and in the prediction of erosive disease. The ELISA for IgM rheumatoid factor is a reasonable alternative for the <b>latex</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>test</b> when age and gender are taken in to consideration.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that the principal anti-y-globulin factors in the sera of patients with rheu-matoid arthritis detected by such commonly em-ployed procedures as the sensitized sheep cell agglutination and <b>latex</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>tests</b> are immuno-globulins of the yM (19 S y-globulin) (2) class (3 - 6). These anti-y-globulins, {{often referred to as}} rheumatoid factors, are not limited in occurrence to rheumatoid arthritis, but are sometimes found in a variety of other disease states (7 - 10). Ex-tensive evidence is now available in support of the concept that these factors are indeed antibodies to various antigenic determinants on the yG (7 S y-globulin) (2) molecule. This evidence has been reviewed by Kunkel (11, 12). Certain sera having high titers of anti-y-globulin activity contain significant quantities of materials sedimenting at a rate intermediate to the 7 and 19 S components (13, 14). Such sera have been encountered in patients having rheumatoid arthritis or a number of other disorders (13 - 15). These materials were shown to be complexes of yG that are readily dissociated in acid buffer or urea (14). It seemed possible that the complexes might repre-sent antigen-antibody complexes of the y-globulin-anti-y-globulin type.

40|$|Renal biopsies and sera from 41 {{consecutive}} {{patients were}} studied {{to determine if}} antiglobulins were found more frequently in patients with severely diseased glomeruli. Patients were classified into three groups: A, 12 patients with normal renal function and minimal histological evidence of glomerular disease; B, 18 patients with normal renal function but distinctly abnormal biopsies (16 cases) or proteinuria greater than 16 g/ 24 h (2 cases); and C, 11 patients with both decreased function and abnormal histology. Positive <b>latex</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>tests</b> for rheumatoid factor were found in none of group A, four (22 %) of group B, and five (45 %) of group C patients. Sera heated 56 degrees C for 30 min contained precipitins reactive with heat-aggregated IgG in none of seven group A, five of ten (50 %) group B, and four of ten (40 %) group C patients. The quantity of 135 I-labeled patient globulin which bound to immunoadsorbents coated with Cohn fraction II in competition with an equal quantity of 131 I-labeled globulin from pooled plasma of normal donors was also measured. Patient globulins bound in significantly greater quantity (greater than or equal 2 SD) than the control in none of the group A, 7 of 18 (39 %) group B, and 7 of 11 (64 %) group C patients. Renal biopsies from 18 patients were also studied for the ability to fix fluorescein-conjugated heat-aggregated and native human IgG. None of nine tissue specimens from group A or B patients fixed either fluorescein-conjugated protein whereas tissue from eight of nine group C patients showed glomerular localization of one or both reagents. Severity of disease as judged by renal function and glomerular histology correlated {{with the presence of}} tissue-fixed and serum antiglobulins. Thus, detection of antiglobulins in glomeruli and sera of patients with glomerulonephritis may indicate a relatively poor prognosis and raises the possibility that antiglobulins may be implicated in some way in the pathophysiology of human glomerulonephritis...|$|R

M. F.). A broadened radiological concept of rheumatoid pneumoconiosis was used in diagnosis. The prevalence of simple pneumoconiosis categories 1, 2, and 3 was 5 · 5 %, and of P. M. F. 0 · 59 %. There were 55 cases accepted as rheumatoid pneumoconiosis, a prevalence of 0 · 26 %. Thirty-two of these had positive <b>latex</b> <b>fixation</b> or Rose-Waaler <b>tests</b> for rheumatoid factor. The prevalence of P. M. F. was found to increase with increasing simple pneumoconiosis prevalence. A slight correlation between rheumatoid pneumoconiosis and simple pneumoconiosis prevalence was also found, but the bulk of the increase in P. M. F. was due to non-rheumatoid cases. The latter was closely paralleled in incidence by that of category 3 simple pneumoconiosis. Grouped results showed that rheumatoid pneumoconiosis occurred in between 2 · 3 % and 6 · 2 % of all men affected by pneumoconiosis.

Routine complete physical examinations were performed on all persons in the sample. Screening procedures utilized in all subjects included: completion of a questionnaire and performance of `rheumatoid factor' tests. When indicated by results of clinical and laboratory examinations, PA roentogenograms of the hands and wrists were obtained. A rheumatologist (ID) reviewed the medical records of all individuals in whom there was evidence to suspect rheumatoid arthritis. 1303 of individual patients whose earlier examinations indicated the need, were recalled for clarification, confirmation and classification of their disease. The time of onset of disease was also established. The prevalence rate of definite rheumatoid arthritis was 0. 38 per cent for males and 0. 65 per cent for females, over 20 years of age, and 0. 55 per cent for both sexes. This prevalence rate for females was {{significantly lower than the}} age adjusted rate in a comparable population in Tecumseh, but this was not so for males.

METHODS [...] Paired sera from 60 patients with respiratory infection who had tested positive for M pneumoniae by complement <b>fixation</b> <b>test</b> were analysed with Serofast and indirect EIA for specific IgG and IgM antibodies. RESULTS [...] Serofast was less sensitive than the two other tests. Only 30 (50 %) out of 60 paired sera which showed a diagnostic seroconversion or had high positive, unchanged antibody titres by complement <b>fixation</b> <b>test</b> or EIA, or both, tested positive with Serofast. Positive test results with Serofast {{were associated with the}} presence of a complement <b>fixation</b> <b>test</b> titre of > or = 512 and high positive IgM antibody titres measurable by EIA; virtually all patients with a complement <b>fixation</b> <b>test</b> titre of < 256 or those responding primarily in the IgG class tested negative with Serofast. Based on analysis of sera taken at the acute phase of infection, 10 (17 %) of the 60 patients tested positive by complement <b>fixation</b> <b>test,</b> 10 (17 %) by EIA, and only four (7 %) by Serofast. CONCLUSIONS [...] Serofast was less sensitive than complement <b>fixation</b> <b>test</b> and EIA and it cannot be recommended as a replacement for either test in routine diagnostic use.

The results were as follows: 1) In the complement <b>fixation</b> <b>test</b> between the purified rickettsiae of Mitani strain and the antiserum of Mitani or Ohzeki strain, marked complement fixation was observed. 2) In the complement <b>fixation</b> <b>test</b> between the purified rickettsiae of Tanizawa strain and the antiserum of Tanizawa or Shichito strain, complement fixation was observed to a high degree. 3) The purified rickettsiae of Ohzeki strain showed marked complement fixation in the antiserum of Ohzeki or Mitani strain. 4) The purified rickettsiae of Shichito strain showed {{a high degree of}} complement fixation in the antiserum of Shichito or Tanizawa strain. Namely, when purified rickettsiae were used as the antigen of the complement <b>fixation</b> <b>test,</b> a significant inhibition of hemolysis was observed to a higher dilution of the antiserum of the homologous strain than that of the heterologous strain...|$|R
40|$|Sheep and {{guinea pigs}} were immunized with {{cellular}} and extracellular antigen from Legionella pneumophila bacteria. After immunization, the animals developed immunoglobulin G titers against the immunizing agent. The same sera were also {{tested in a}} Mycoplasma pneumoniae complement <b>fixation</b> <b>test.</b> All the preimmunization sera from sheep showed positive M. pneumoniae complement <b>fixation</b> <b>tests</b> of varying titers, with significant antibody rises in two of five sheep {{as a result of}} the Legionella immunizations. In contrast to the sheep, all the guinea pigs were negative in the M. pneumoniae complement <b>fixation</b> <b>test,</b> both in their preimmunization sera and after completion of the Legionella immunizations. The results obtained with the sheep sera may be explained as a nonspecific booster effect of Legionella bacteria upon previously elicited immune responses...|$|R
