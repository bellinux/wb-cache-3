50|$|Declawing of crabs is {{the process}} whereby one or both claws of a live crab (including king crabs) are {{manually}} pulled off and the animal is {{then returned to the}} water. It occurs in several fisheries worldwide, such as in the Florida stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) fishery, the north-east Atlantic deep-water red crab (Chaceon affinis) fishery and in southern Iberia, where the major claws of the fiddler crab Uca tangeri are harvested. Around Northern Europe, an extensive fishery exists for claws of the edible crab, Cancer pagurus. The practice is defended because some crabs can naturally autotomise (shed) limbs and then about a year later after a series of moults, regenerate these limbs. It is argued that declawing therefore provides a sustainable fishery. Claw removal is also promoted to assist in handling of animals, and to decrease losses through entanglement in nets and cannibalism. Declawing crabs is legal in the UK since revocation in 2000 of the Crab Claws (Prohibition of <b>Landing)</b> <b>Order</b> 1986. One crab that is subject to widespread declawing is the Florida stone crab, for which tourist information is provided.|$|E
40|$|An {{efficient}} algorithm is presented, {{based on the}} well-known algorithm for the traveling salesman problem, for scheduling aircraft arrivals into major terminal areas. The algorithm permits, but strictly limits, reassigning an aircraft from its initial position in the <b>landing</b> <b>order.</b> This limitation is needed so that no aircraft or aircraft category is unduly penalized. Results indicate, for the mix of arrivals investigated, a potential increase in capacity in the 3 to 5 percent range. Furthermore, it is shown that the computation time for the algorithm grows only linearly with problem size...|$|E
50|$|Another {{priority}} {{closely linked}} to the expansion of agriculture was the promotion of immigration to Queensland, to alleviate severe labour and skills shortages, expand the amount of land under cultivation, and create a local market for Queensland produce. To encourage the expansion of agriculture, amendments were made in 1861 to the Alienation of Crown Lands Act of 1860, whereby a system of <b>land</b> <b>orders</b> was introduced as an incentive to immigrants. This system was incorporated into the Immigration Act of 1864, and entitled immigrants from steerage or intermediate class who had paid their full passage to the receipt of non-transferable <b>land</b> <b>orders.</b> These <b>land</b> <b>orders</b> could be exchanged for any country or suburban land offered for sale by auction or selection to the value of the <b>land</b> <b>orders</b> issued. Assisted passages were offered to labourers and mechanics, but these persons usually did not receive <b>land</b> <b>orders</b> from 1864. Immigrants from England, Ireland and Scotland were the targeted group, but the Act also provided for emigration from Germany at the rate of no more than 2,000 adults per annum. In the 20 years (1861-81) that the <b>land</b> <b>order</b> system operated in Queensland, 9,514 German immigrants arrived on 45 voyages.|$|R

40|$|A fuzzy reasoning-based {{method for}} {{scheduling}} air {{traffic in the}} terminal area has been designed at the NASA Ames Research Center and operationally tested at the Dallas/Fort Worth Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON). The scheduling system sequences and assigns landing times to arrival aircraft by utilizing continuous updates of aircraft radar data and controller inputs. The scheduling algorithm contains a knowledge base which was refined during several thousand hours of controller-in-the-loop real-time simulations. This knowledge base applies fuzzy reasoning to evaluate propositions that consider both performance criteria and workload criteria, such as delay reduction and conflict avoidance. Operational test {{results show that the}} algorithm determines an efficient arrival plan to land aircraft in a manner acceptable to the air traffic controllers.

40|$|Development of an arrival air-traffic {{management}} {{system for a}} single runway. Traffic is segregated {{throughout most of the}} near terminal area according to performance characteristics. Nominal approach routes for each class of aircraft are determined by an optimization procedure. In this fashion, the nominal approach routes are dependent upon and, hence, determined by the near terminal area operating capabilities of each class of aircraft. The <b>landing</b> <b>order</b> and spacing of aircraft on the common approach path are determined so that a measure of total system deviation from the nominal landing times is minimized and safety standards are met. Delay maneuvers required to satisfy sequencing needs are then carried out in a manner dependent upon the particular class of aircraft being maneuvered. Finally, results are presented to illustrate the effects of the rate of arrivals upon a one-runway system serving three different classes of aircraft employing several different sequencing strategies and measures of total system deviation...|$|E

40|$|The {{air traffic}} control {{subsystem}} that performs scheduling is discussed. The function of the scheduling algorithms is to plan automatically the most efficient <b>landing</b> <b>order</b> and to assign optimally spaced landing times to all arrivals. Several important scheduling algorithms are described and the statistical performance of the scheduling algorithms is examined. Scheduling brings order to an arrival sequence for aircraft. First-come-first-served scheduling (FCFS) establishes a fair order, based on estimated times of arrival, and determines proper separations. Because of the randomness of the traffic, gaps {{will remain in the}} scheduled sequence of aircraft. These gaps are filled, or partially filled, by time-advancing the leading aircraft after a gap while still preserving the FCFS order. Tightly scheduled groups of aircraft remain with a mix of heavy and large aircraft. Separation requirements differ for different types of aircraft trailing each other. Advantage is taken of this fact through mild reordering of the traffic, thus shortening the groups and reducing average delays. Actual delays for different samples with the same statistical parameters vary widely, especially for heavy traffic...|$|E
40|$|When genetic {{algorithms}} (GAs) {{are applied to}} combinatorial problems, permutation representations are usually adopted. Asa result, suchGAsare often confronted with feasibility and memory-efficiency problems. With the aircraft sequencing problem (ASP) as a study case, this paper reports on a novel binary-representation-based GA scheme for combinatorial problems. Unlike existing GAs for the ASP, which typically use permutation representations based on aircraft <b>landing</b> <b>order,</b> the new GA introduces a novel ripple-spreading model which transforms the original landing-order-based ASP solutions into value-based ones. In the new scheme, arriving aircraft are projected as points into an artificial space. A deterministic method inspired by the natural phenomenon of ripple-spreading on liquid surfaces is developed, which uses a few parameters as input to connect points on this space to form a landing sequence. A traditional GA, free of feasibility and memory-efficiency problems, can then be used to evolve the ripple-spreading related parameters {{in order to find}} an optimal sequence. Since the ripple-spreadingmodel is the centerpiece of the new algorithm, it is called the ripple-spreading GA (RSGA). The advantages of the proposed RSGA are illustrated by extensive comparative studies for the case of the ASP...|$|E
40|$|The {{last few}} decades a lot of {{attention}} has been paid to Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) in Air Traffic Management. A lot of models are proposed in which information of stakeholders (mainly airlines) is used in some way to improve the decision process. When doing this, fairness becomes an important issue. However, it is not always clear what will be considered fair by the airlines involved. In this paper we will use the aircraft landing problem to illustrate various definitions of fairness, that stem from the use of airline preferences. In this problem, a <b>landing</b> <b>order</b> and feasible landing times have to be determined for a set of flights at a runway. The airlines cost and the various definitions of fairness are used as objective for the problem. Local search heuristics are introduced to solve these formulations. Numerical experiments using schedule data from a large European airport are used to evaluate how the fairness definitions and heuristics behave for real life problems. The results show that it is possible to achieve more fairness, while still obtaining considerable cost savings compared to the First Come First Served schedule. The heuristics obtain reductions of up to 26 % in the root mean square deviation of the average cost per airline. The different heuristics show that schedules with different trade-offs between efficiency, cost, delay and fairness can be obtained. Hopefully, these results can be a starting point for discussing the fairness issues related to the introduction of CDM processes among air traffic stakeholders. ...|$|E
