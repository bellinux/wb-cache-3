2500|$|Although the sonnets were {{published}} in 1609, the exact date of when they were written is unclear. It is estimated that the sonnets could have been written between 1588 and 1593. The sonnets are written about two characters in particular: the Dark Lady and an unknown young man. Scholar Kenneth Muir states that the first 126 sonnets were written about a man {{and the others were}} written about the Dark Lady. The identity of the young man is still a mystery today. The only clue that was left about who this young man may be is Shakespeare's dedication to a [...] "Mr. W.H". There has been much speculation of whether who this young man may be. Many scholars have their own idea of who [...] "Mr. W.H." [...] may be. In Raymond Macdonald Alden's book, he has a chapter dedicated to who [...] "the friend's" [...] true identity may be. William Harte was one name that was thrown out there. William Harte was Shakespeare's nephew but the dates do not match up with the sonnet. Scholar Tyrwhitt suggests the name William Hughes. This name was quite the popular choice. The <b>list</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>on.</b> Scholars thought any man with the initials [...] "W.H."

Gilbert enthused that, [...] "It sounds huge. When you put our old records on and our new record, there's actually less guitars on our new album, but it sounds bigger."

[...] Pundik also spoke of the band's desire to challenge themselves musically; [...] "Usually with every record we think, 'We’ve got to put the fast punk song on it or people won't like it', but this wasn't anything like that."
