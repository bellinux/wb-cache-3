50|$|<b>Landfill</b> <b>mining</b> and {{reclamation}} (LFMR) is {{a process}} whereby solid wastes which have previously been landfilled are excavated and processed. The function of <b>landfill</b> <b>mining</b> {{is to reduce the}} amount of landfill mass encapsulated within the closed landfill and/or temporarily remove hazardous material to allow protective measures to be taken before the landfill mass is replaced. In the process, mining recovers valuable recyclable materials, a combustible fraction, soil, and landfill space. The aeration of the landfill soil is a secondary benefit regarding the landfill's future use. The combustible fraction is useful for the generation of power. The overall appearance of the <b>landfill</b> <b>mining</b> procedure is a sequence of processing machines laid out in a functional conveyor system.

5000|$|Mining of {{municipal}} landfills {{is more complicated}} {{and has to be}} based on the expected content of the landfill. Older landfills, in the United States before 1994, were often capped and closed, essentially entombing the waste. This can be beneficial for waste recovery. It can also create a higher risk for toxic waste and leachate exposure as the landfill has not fully processed the stewing wastes. Mining of bioreactor landfills and properly stabilized modern sanitary landfills provides its own benefits. The biodegradable wastes are more easily sieved out, leaving the non-biodegradable materials readily accessible. The quality of these materials for recycling and reprocessing purposes is not as high as initially recycled materials, however materials such as aluminum and steel are usually excluded from this. [...] <b>Landfill</b> <b>mining</b> is most useful as a method to remediate hazardous landfills. Landfills that were established before landfill liner technology was well established often leak their unprocessed leachate into underlying aquifers. This is both an environmental hazard and also a legal liability. In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency requires closed landfills to be monitored for at least 30 years after waste placement ceases. Mining the landfill simply to lay a safe liner is a last, but sometimes necessary resort.|$|E

40|$|<b>Landfill</b> <b>mining</b> is an environmentally-friendly {{technology}} that combines {{the concepts of}} material recycling and sustainable waste management, and it has received {{a great deal of}} worldwide attention because of its significant environmental and economic potential in material recycling, energy recovery, land reclamation and pollution prevention. This work applied a cost-benefit analysis model for assessing the economic feasibility, which is important for promoting <b>landfill</b> <b>mining.</b> The model includes eight indicators of costs and nine indicators of benefits. Four <b>landfill</b> <b>mining</b> scenarios were designed and analyzed based on field data. The economic feasibility of <b>landfill</b> <b>mining</b> was then evaluated by the indicator of net present value (NPV). According to our case study of a typical old <b>landfill</b> <b>mining</b> project in China (Yingchun landfill), rental of excavation and hauling equipment, waste processing and material transportation were the top three costs of <b>landfill</b> <b>mining,</b> accounting for 88. 2 % of the total cost, and the average cost per unit of stored waste was 12. 7 USD ton(- 1). The top three benefits of <b>landfill</b> <b>mining</b> were electricity generation by incineration, land reclamation and recycling soil-like materials. The NPV analysis of the four different scenarios indicated that the Yingchun <b>landfill</b> <b>mining</b> project could obtain a net positive benefit varying from 1. 92 million USD to 16. 63 million USD. However, the NPV was sensitive to the mode of land reuse, the availability of energy recovery facilities and the possibility of obtaining financial support by avoiding post-closure care.

40|$|The overall aim of {{the thesis}} {{is to examine the}} {{institutional}} conditions for the implementation and emergence of <b>landfill</b> <b>mining.</b> The result shows that  current policy makes it difficult for <b>landfill</b> <b>mining</b> operators to find a market outlet for the exhumed material, which means that <b>landfill</b> <b>mining</b> may result in a waste disposal problem. Regulations also restrict accessibility to the material in landfills. Therefore, it has generally been municipal landfill owners that perform <b>landfill</b> <b>mining</b> operations, which directs learning processes towards solving landfill problems rather than resource recovery. <b>Landfill</b> <b>mining</b> is not, however, necessarily to be perceived as a recycling activity. It could also be understood as a remediation or mining activity. This would result in more favorable institutional conditions for <b>landfill</b> <b>mining</b> in terms of better access to the market and the material in the landfill. The regulatory framework surrounding landfills is based on a perception of landfills as a source of pollution, a problem that should be avoided, capped and closed. Extracting resources from landfills, challenges this perception and therefore results in a mismatch with the regulatory framework. On the other hand, the material in mines is typically regarded in the formal institutions as a positive occurrence. Mining activities are regarded as the backbone of the Swedish economy and therefore receive various forms of political support. This favorable regulatory framework is not available for secondary resource production. Based on the identified institutional conditions, institutional challenges are identified. The core of these challenges is a conflict between the policy goal of increased recycling and a non-toxic environment. Secondary resources are typically punished through strict requirements for marketability, while primary resources are supported through subsidies such as tax exemptions. The authorities lack capacity to manage the emergence of unconventional and complex activities such as <b>landfill</b> <b>mining.</b> The institutional arrangements that are responsible for landfills primarily perceive them as pollution, while the institutions responsible for resources, on the other hand, assume them {{to be found in the}} bedrock.

The feasibility of ELFM is studied by synthesizing the research on the Closing the Circle project, the first ELFM project targeting the 18 million metric ton landfill in Houthalen-Helchteren in the East of Belgium. It is argued that Environmental Impact Assessments of ELFM projects should be wide in scope and time. Embedded in a broad resource management perspective, the worldwide potential of ELFM is highlighted, in terms of climate gains, materials and energy utilization, job creation and land reclamation. The potential is quantified for the EU- 27 with its 150, 000 - 500, 000 landfills.

40|$|There is a {{widespread}} agreement that sustainability depends on the willingness {{to take into account}} different interests and perspectives (e. g. inter- and intra-generational solidarity in the classical Brundland definition; Elkington’s “People – Profit – Planet”). As a consequence there are high expectations in multi-actor collaboration insights and work forms. However the contexts in which these insights and work forms have been mostly developed (local initiatives, with governmental funding), may not be representative for the new sustainability challenges ahead (connection local-global, long term perspective, political arenas, legal implications, strong business interests, technological innovation for more eco-efficiency). In this presentation we explore how these challenges influence the multi-actor collaborative process. Our analysis is based on the functioning of a multi-actor group, called the Enhanced <b>Landfill</b> <b>Mining</b> Consortium (ELFM-Consortium). We took up the role of action-researchers and process facilitators for this group. For the analysis we can rely on the videotaped meetings of the consortium and individual interviews with the participants, during a period of six months. The ELFM Consortium consists of approximately 15 persons, representing various research centers (technical, economics and human sciences), a business firm, a government agency and a local committee. The Consortium wants to generate knowledge for integrating <b>landfill</b> <b>mining</b> in a sustainable material management cycle. “Enhanced” refers to the radically improved, sustainable way in which this activity should take place. Historically, taking space for waste has been the non-sustainable end-of-pipe solution of linear production processes. For the Consortium these landfills are wasted spaces. Landfills shoud be considered as sources of energy and materials, with an enormous economic potential. However, <b>landfill</b> <b>mining</b> as a contribution to sustainability is all but an evident aim. There are high risks and uncertainties for the involved actors and different barriers have to be crossed. Some examples. Can technological innovations guarantee safe <b>landfill</b> <b>mining</b> activities? Will there be acceptance of local communities and broader society? Will it be possible to adapt the existing legal regulations that impede <b>landfill</b> <b>mining</b> and what about political lobbying on a regional and European level in this process?

40|$|Mining {{and copper}} {{production}} in Bor, {{in the past}} hundred years, had {{a huge impact on}} the environment of town, but also in a wide region. In the area of Bor, in the zone of Mining and Smelting Company (RTB) activity, over 29, 000 ha of land under forests and fields is degraded. The area of degraded agricultural land in the Bor municipality is over 60 % of total agricultural land. Wastewater, generated in the sites of RTB Bor, pollute the Bor River and Krivelj River, which still flow into the Timok River and Danube River. These pollutions are often presented by low pH value, increased content of heavy metal ions, suspended particles and fine particles of flotation tailings, which is deposited in the valleys of these rivers on the area of over 2000 hectares. During the decades of exploitation of ore from the open pit Bor at different locations ("Visoki Planir" - also called “Oštreljski planir”, "Severni planir" dump of ore body "H" (RTH)) gangue and tailings were delayed. The largest amount of tailings, about 150 million tons, was postponed on location Visoki planir. The effect of the mining waste and the impact of the whole process of processing copper ore to the final products on the environment, was conducted during the 4 th study period of the project "Management of mining waste-tailing dump in the Bor region," supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion Science (Eng. Japan Society for the Promotion of Science) and the Japan international cooperation Agency and the Ministry of environment, Mining and Spatial planning of the Republic of Serbia. Influence of season on the level of pollutants in soil and water, the impact on water quality in the river Timok and the River Danube, was conducted during first three periods of project. This paper presents the results of the third study period. The third period of research, which was conducted over a period of 17. 10. 2012 to 17. 01. 2013 year, included a review of pollution sources and define their impact on the environment.
