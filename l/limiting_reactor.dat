The inductive reactance is chosen to be low enough for an acceptable voltage drop during normal operation, but high enough to restrict a short circuit to the rating of the switchgear.

A small reactor was installed at each {{head of the line}} to set protection boundaries, thus adjacent lines are easily discriminated. In [62], the system simply adopted the over current and low voltage protection principle, but {{there was no need to}} utilize time delay to guarantee the selectivity. In fact, this method that uses current <b>limiting</b> <b>reactors</b> to divide the grid into different zones is borrowed from the protection scheme in HVDC grids.

30|$|Short circuit current {{can cause}} {{mechanical}} and thermal stresses {{proportional to the}} square of the current, and hence lead to the damage of the equipment in power system. This situation is worsened with the increase of interconnections in power system and high-capacity generators being injected to the grid. Short circuit current can be limited in many ways, which can be divided into two categories depending on the cost and effect. One is to open the switches of lines or buses, which is simple, economical and obviously effective. However, this method has a greater impact on the system stability. The other is to increase the installations of electrical equipment or upgrade them, such as installing the current <b>limiting</b> <b>reactor</b> or fault current limiter (FCL), even replacing with the high-impedance transformer. This method has little influence on the system stability, but the high cost is needed and the effect is limited.|$|E

40|$|Distributed {{generators}} (DG) {{are scattered}} throughout the countryside. As a result, they are of relatively small power and should be connected without commutating apparata to low and medium voltage radial power lines. The protection of this power line loses accuracy. To what extent current or distant protection is impaired, depends on many factors. The negative impact of DG is characterized by setting ratio (SR) : the relation of current or impedance setting with DG to these quantities without DG. SR depends primarily on DG fault quotients – the fault current of separate DG divided by total fault current of main source and all DG connected to this radial line. Usually DG fault quotients are greater than DG load shares and grow {{to the end of}} radial line. SR are worse when fault quotients increase along the line.

This thesis investigates three possible fault current limiting measures in the Dutch transmission grid which is operated and maintained by TenneT TSO. In order to evaluate the behavior of the fault current limiting measures, two independently operating grid models were established and validated. The examined fault current limiters consisted of a current <b>limiting</b> <b>reactor</b> (CLR) and a superconducting fault current limiter (SCFCL). The possibility of substation splitting was also investigated. All three measures reduced the short-circuit levels successfully to values within the electromechanical and thermal withstand levels of the power system.

A short circuit limiting coupler is designed and the transient and voltage stability studies are performed with a short circuit limiting coupler (SLC) applied at the two 132 kV incoming supply lines from Eskom. The simulations are based 011 solving ordinary loadflow cases augmented with dynamic models of the system elements. Motor loads were modelled in detail incorporating their dynamic characteristics. 75 % of the Sasol Three system load constitute induction motors and 25 % is constant impedance and constant current load models.

The most impressive results {{is the way the}} Sasol Three System recovers in the range of milliseconds when subjected to severe disturbance with regard to voltage and transient stability.

40|$|In {{designing}} a reactor system {{to produce a}} resin, the limits of feasible molecular weights and conversions provide targets and alternatives for the design and a rapid assessment of feasibility. To find the feasibility limits for polymers a geometric method called the attainable region has been developed in terms of quantities which can be specified during production: moments of the molecular weight distribution for homopolymers and average compositions for copolymers. These quantities {{can be related to}} properties and calculated in simulations. However, the key is to find the limits of these quantities without fully specifying the reactor system. ^ From the attainable regions for free-radical polymerizations, maximum and minimum molecular weights and the reactor systems corresponding to these limits have been determined. In particular, it is found that isothermal polymerizations can produce molecular weights an order of magnitude greater than adiabatic systems. The highest molecular weights are substantially above those typically produced, and so products with different properties than those currently made may be possible. ^ From the feasibility limits it was determined that the highest molecular weights are produced in an isothermal continuous stirred tank reactor, and when only adiabatic reactors are considered the maximum molecular weight is produced in a plug-flow reactor. These extremes of perfect backmixing and plug-flow arise because the type of mixing which produces the highest molecular weight depends on whether molecular weight increases or decreases with conversion. ^ For copolymers, the attainable region shows the <b>limiting</b> <b>reactor</b> systems and feasible average compositions. The results show that through a simpler method one can find the feasible copolymer compositions. These limiting compositions are bounded by the feed composition and the product of a plug-flow (or batch) reactor. ^ Along with the attainable regions of molecular weights and copolymer compositions, other dependent variables can be determined and developed into 2 ̆ 2 corresponding regions. 2 ̆ 2 These regions show in two dimensions the limits for dependent variables when finding the feasibility limits of an attainable region. In the case of homopolymers, corresponding regions show the polydispersities, initiator concentrations, and residence times for the associated attainable molecular weights. For copolymers the corresponding regions show the conversions, molecular weights, and residence times for attainable copolymer compositions. These regions can be used to find alternatives for reactor system designs. Thus, with these methods, one can find the feasible products, target reactor systems for achieving the limiting products, and generate alternatives for reactor systems that meet product specifications. ...|$|E

40|$|Hydrothermal {{oxidation}} (HTO) is {{a promising}} {{technology for the}} treatment of aqueous-fluid hazardous and mixed waste streams. Waste streams identified as likely candidates for treatment by this technology are primarily aqueous fluids containing hazardous organic compounds, and often containing inorganic compounds including radioisotopes (mixed wastes). These wastes are difficult and expensive to treat by conventional technologies (e. g. incineration) due to their high water content; in addition, incineration can lead to concerns related to stack releases. An especially attractive potential advantage of HTO over conventional treatment methods is the total containment of all reaction products within the overall system. The potential application of hydrothermal oxidation (HTO) technology {{for the treatment of}} DOE hazardous or mixed wastes has been uncertain due to concerns about safe and efficient operation of the technology. In principle, aqueous DOE wastes, including hazardous an d mixed waste, can be treated with this technology. Oxidation reactions are carried out in the aqueous phase at high temperatures ({approx} 600 C), effectively converting organic waste constituents to nonhazardous materials (e. g., CO 2). Inorganic materials which become insoluble in supercritical water may precipitate as scales adhering to components of the reactor, <b>limiting</b> <b>reactor</b> availability and necessitating frequent cleaning of the system. Also, most hazardous organic compounds contain heteroatoms (other than carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen). These heteroatoms, including halides (F, Cl, Br, I), sulfur, phosphorus, and some nitrogen groups, form strong mineral acids on oxidation of the organic compounds, resulting in a solution having low pH and high oxidation potential. This combination, in conjunction with the high temperatures and high fluid densities attained in both the heating and cooling regions of an HTO reactor, can lead to corrosion of structural materials (usually metal s) anticipated for use in HTO reactor construction. Methods have been suggested for mitigating the problems arising from the production of mineral acids and insoluble solids in HTO processes (Barnes et al., 1993). Previous work in this Laboratory centered on the problems arising from the presence of corrosive or insoluble inorganic compounds in HTO fluids (Simonson et al., 1993, 1994, 1995). However, significant gaps in our knowledge of process chemistry remained at the initiation of this project. It was not possible to determine accurately the properties of coexisting fluid phases; the solubilities of radioactive components of mixed wastes were unknown at high temperatures; and molecular level understanding of interparticle interactions was needed for reliable extrapolation of phenomenological equations for solution behavior beyond the range of experimental results. The present project was undertaken to address these deficiencies. The project was undertaken to provide fundamental information needed to support deployment decisions related to HTO technology, and no innovations in the technology per se were anticipated. Rather, the innovations of this project involved applying new or existing experimental and modeling approaches to studies of aqueous inorganic reactions and properties under the rigorous anticipated HTO operating conditions. This work was made possible in part through the support of researchers at ORNL and the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, by the Division of Chemical Sciences, Geosciences and Biosciences, Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the Department of Energy.

In [30], an artificial neural network (ANN) method for multi-terminal HVDC protection relaying has been suggested which uses sampling frequency of 10 kHz. It cannot detect fault which has resistance higher than 100  Ω. In [31], application of multilevel full bridge converters in HVDC multiterminal systems has been proposed. Therefore, reliability and selectivity of the system depends on all the parameters. In [32], a method has been proposed in which the relay embedded into each converter sends a trip signal to the rectifier to identify the fault whenever over current is above a threshold.
