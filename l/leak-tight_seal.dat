50|$|Economical {{globe valves}} or stop valves {{with a similar}} {{mechanism}} used in plumbing often have a rubber washer {{at the bottom of}} the disc for the seating surface, so that rubber can be compressed against the seat to form a <b>leak-tight</b> <b>seal</b> when shut.|$|E
50|$|The seat is the {{interior}} {{surface of the}} body which contacts the disc to form a <b>leak-tight</b> <b>seal.</b> In discs that move linearly or swing on a hinge or trunnion, the disc comes into contact with the seat only when the valve is shut. In disks that rotate, the seat is always in contact with the disk, but the area of contact changes as the disc is turned. The seat always remains stationary relative to the body.|$|E
5000|$|Flare {{fittings}} are {{a type of}} {{compression fitting}} used with metal tubing, usually soft steel, ductile (soft) copper and aluminum, though other materials are also used. Tube flaring {{is considered to be}} a type of forging operation, and is usually a cold working procedure. During assembly, a flare nut is used to secure the flared tubing's tapered end to the also tapered fitting, producing a pressure-resistant, <b>leak-tight</b> <b>seal.</b> Flared connections offer a high degree of long-term reliability and for this reason are often used in mission-critical and inaccessible locations.|$|E

40|$|As {{a part of}} the {{development}} work associated with the design of vacuum components for the Thermonuclear Project, a program was initiated for the testing of high vacuum bakeable flange and gasket designs for <b>leak-tight</b> <b>sealing</b> requirements. The flange and gasket components, chosen for the initial study because of the simplicity in design and low yield point of the gasket material, consisted of the fully annealed, type 1100, aluminum alloy compressed between plane flange surfaces which had a 32 mu in. -rms finish. <b>Leak-tight</b> <b>sealing</b> of the 99 % aluminum, 10 -inch wire was found to be dependent on the yield point and creep properties of the alloy. It was demonstrated, (1) that sealing was accomplished when the bolt loaded flange exceeded the yield point of the strain hardened gasket, and (2) the life of the gasket was dependent on the rate of deformation during thermal cycling between room temperature and 250 deg C. It was possible to maintain a satisfactory vacuum seal STA< 10 /sup - 9 / torr liter-sec/sup - 1 /-(gasket in.) /sup - 1 /! for more than 18 thermal cycles with four hours per bake at the elevated temperature. Initial sealing of this 0. 088 -in. diameter gasket was achieved with approximately 0. 028 -in. gasket deformation and a force of 1500 lbs (linear in.) /sup - 1 / or (71 / 2 tons-in. /sup - 2 /) The maximum loading force required to achieve a seal (i. e., to cause plastic flow) was approximately 81 / 2 tons. in. /sup - 2 /, or 3000 lbs (linear in.) /sup - 1 / of gasket.

40|$|Patch {{clamping}} {{is considered}} the gold standard in measuring the bioelectrical activity of a cell. It is used to detect and measure ion transport through ion channels located throughout a cell membrane. Ion movement is crucial to cell viability and cell-to-cell communication. Pharmaceutical companies increasingly target ion channels because of their significance in disease and to help design better targeted drugs. However, the traditional method of patch clamping is cumbersome and is being replaced by planar high throughput screening (HTS) systems. These systems are reaching their limits due to materials and cost of processing; cell handling methods and small varieties of applicable cell types are also issues to be addressed. In this work, the core components {{of a new kind}} of planar patch clamping device have been designed and developed, after analysis of currently available HTS systems. This design approaches patch clamping using polymers to overcome some of the limitations in current systems, specifically cell handling and positioning, by using a simple modification technique to provide distinct attractive areas for cell binding. This uniquely allows the culture of both single cells and cell networks to increase the range of cell types that can be measured and circumvents challenges from using suction to pull cells onto measurement holes. The components of the design are a 10 x 10 array of small holes drilled in a polymer then aligned modifications for precise cell placement are added and a planar electrode array for individual addressing of each cell. A study of methods to produce a <b>leak-tight</b> <b>seal</b> required between microfluidic chambers was done. Cell adhesion parameters for the modification techniques were established. The principle viability of this approach was confirmed using the modification technique to culture cells over holes and measure their resistance using a rig developed for this work...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a micro propulsion system. The trend of miniaturization of satellites requires small sized propulsion systems. For particular missions it is important to maintain an accurate distance between multiple satellites. Satellites drift apart due to differences in mass, area and position of the satellites. A miniaturized propulsion system of a cold gas blow-down rocket engine is presented. The system consists of two parts; the low pressure storage system and the feeding and thruster system. The feeding and thruster system can generate the thrust required for position corrections of the satellite. It consists of several functional modules; an active valve, a particle filter, a nozzle and an electronic module. A nozzle is needed which can deliver a thrust in the mN range. The nozzle is used to increase the efficiency of the propulsion system. We explored the fabrication of a 3 D conical converging-diverging nozzle shape by means of MST techniques. These techniques are: deep reactive ion etching, femtosecond laser machining and a technique which uses powder blasting in combination with a heat treatment. It is shown that the latter two methods are most promising. The valve has to be very leak-tight to ensure a successful satellite mission. In conventional valves a low leak-rate is obtained by a large and forceful actuator. To allow for smaller valves a novel design is presented requiring low force â€“ and thus a smaller actuator - while still promising to be leak-tight. A flexible thin film membrane is pulled over a valve seat pattern to make a <b>leak-tight</b> <b>seal.</b> Due to the flexibility of this membrane it can deform and adjust to the surface topography. A lot of {{progress has been made in}} the manufacturing of this novel valve...|$|E
40|$|Gas Technology Institute is {{developing}} a novel concept of membrane gasifier for high efficiency, clean and low cost production of hydrogen from coal. The concept incorporates a hydrogen-selective membrane within a gasification reactor for direct extraction of hydrogen from coal-derived synthesis gases. The objective of this project {{is to determine the}} technical and economic feasibility of this concept by screening, testing and identifying potential candidate membranes under high temperature, high pressure, and harsh environments of the coal gasification conditions. The best performing membranes will be selected for preliminary reactor design and cost estimates. To evaluate the performances of the candidate membranes under the gasification conditions, a high temperature/high pressure hydrogen permeation unit has been constructed in this project. During this reporting period, the unit has been fully commissioned and is operational. The unit is capable of operating at temperatures up to 1100 C and pressures to 60 atm for evaluation of ceramic membranes such as mixed ionic conducting membrane. A double-seal technique has been developed and tested successfully to achieve <b>leak-tight</b> <b>seal</b> for the membranes. Initial data for a commercial Palladium-Gold membrane were obtained at temperatures to 450 C and pressures to 13 atm. Tests for the perovskite membranes are being performed and the results will be reported in the next quarter. A membrane gasification reactor model was developed to consider the H{sub 2 } permeability of the membrane, the kinetics and the equilibriums of the gas phase reactions in the gasifier, the operating conditions and the configurations of the membrane reactor. The results show that the hydrogen production efficiency using the novel membrane gasification reactor concept can be increased by about 50 % versus the conventional gasification process. This confirms the previous evaluation results from the thermodynamic equilibrium calculation. A rigorous model for hydrogen permeation through mixed proton-electron conducting ceramic membranes was also developed based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The results from the simulation work confirm that the hydrogen flux increases with increasing partial pressure of hydrogen. The presence of steam in the permeate side can have a small negative effect on the hydrogen flux, in the order of 10 %. When the steam partial pressure is greater than 1 atm, the hydrogen flux becomes independent of the steam pressure...|$|E
40|$|In non-lubricated piston {{compressors}} {{the wear}} of the piston rod packing rings {{is still a}} problem {{that needs to be}} considered. Due to the demands of high gas pressure and <b>leak-tight</b> <b>sealing</b> the frictional heat of the rings is causing high temperatures {{in the area of the}} piston rod packing. High temperatures are â€“ among other factors â€“ one reason for an increase of wear and thus for a lifetime reduction of the packing. To increase this lifetime â€“ and so to increase the time between two technical services â€“ the idea of an internal cooling of the piston rod with a phase changing medium was created. To investigate this new cooling method for non-lubricated piston compressors a research project between the EFRC R 2 Ì† 6 D Working Group (European Forum for Reciprocating Compressors) and the Technical University of Dresden was initiated. Within this project a test bench with a full scale balanced opposed process gas compressor was set up and measurements shall be taken. The measured values will be used for a validation of a thermal simulation model based on the software ANSYS. Also a model test rig is investigated which allows the investigation of temperature along a hollow piston rod in a moving system...|$|R
40|$|A new four-chamber {{piston pump}} design has been {{fabricated}} and tested. The small-scale propellant pump {{is intended to}} be powered by gas at elevated temperatures, e. g. in a gas-generator cycle rocket propulsion system. Two key features are combined for the first time: <b>leak-tight</b> liquid-cooled <b>seals,</b> and a high throughput per unit hardware mass. Measured performance curves quantify flows, pressures, leakage, volumetric efficiency, and tank pressure requirements. A pair of 300 -gram pumps operating with significant margin could deliver fuel and oxidizer at 5 MPa to a compact lightweight 1000 -N engine, while tank pressure remains at 0. 35 MPa. Pump weight is well below one percent of thrust, as is typical for launch vehicle engines.

This novel joining technique {{was conducted by}} the Russian Federal Nuclear Center, working under contract for the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. These bimetallic transitions are being considered for use in future superconducting radio-frequency cavity cryomodule assemblies. This application requires cryogenic testing to demonstrate that this transition joint remains <b>leak-tight</b> when <b>sealing</b> superfluid helium. To simulate a titanium cavity vessel connection to a stainless steel service pipe, bimetallic transition joints were paired together to fabricate piping assemblies.

5000|$|Several vacuum flange {{standards}} exist, and {{the same}} flange types are called by different names by different manufacturers and standards organizations.CF (ConFlat) flanges use a copper gasket and knife-edge flange to achieve an ultrahigh vacuum seal. The term [...] "ConFlat" [...] is a registered trademark of Varian, Inc., so [...] "CF" [...] is commonly used by other flange manufacturers. Each face of the two mating CF flanges has a knife edge, which cuts into the softer metal gasket, providing an extremely <b>leak-tight,</b> metal-to-metal <b>seal.</b> Deformation of the metal gasket fills small defects in the flange, allowing Conflat flanges operate down to 10âˆ’13 Torr (10âˆ’11 Pa) pressure. The knife edge is recessed in a groove in each flange. In addition to protecting the knife edge, the groove helps hold the gasket in place, which aligns the two flanges and also reduces gasket expansion during bake-out. For stainless-steel conflat flanges, baking temperatures of 450 Â°C can be achieved; the temperature {{is limited by the}} choice of gasket material. CF flanges are sexless and interchangeable. In North America, flange sizes are given by flange outer diameter in inches, while in Europe and Asia, sizes are given by tube inner diameter in millimeters. Despite the different naming conventions, the actual flanges are the same.|$|R
50|$|The {{bearings}} {{have to be}} <b>leak-tight.</b> A hermetic <b>seal,</b> {{usually a}} liquid seal, is employed; a turbine oil at pressure higher than the hydrogen inside is typically used. A metal, e.g. brass, ring is pressed by springs onto the generator shaft, the oil is forced under pressure between the ring and the shaft; part of the oil flows into the hydrogen side of the generator, another part to the air side. The oil entrains {{a small amount of}} air; as the oil is recirculated, some of the air is carried over into the generator. This causes a gradual air contamination buildup and requires maintaining hydrogen purity. Scavenging systems are used for this purpose; gas (mixture of entrained air and hydrogen, released from the oil) is collected in the holding tank for the sealing oil, and released into the atmosphere; the hydrogen losses have to be replenished, either from gas cylinders or from on-site hydrogen generators. Degradation of bearings leads to higher oil leaks, which increases the amount of air transferred into the generator; increased oil consumption can be detected by a flow meter associated to each bearing.|$|R
