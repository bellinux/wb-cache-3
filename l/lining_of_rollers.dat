40|$|The {{spinning}} triangle is {{a critical}} area in the spinning process of staple yarns. Its geometry influences the distribution of fiber tension in the spinning triangle and the properties of spun yarns. In earlier theoretical models, the spinning tension of the yarn acting on the convergence point {{is assumed to be}} perpendicular to the nip <b>line</b> <b>of</b> front <b>rollers.</b> This assumption is reasonable {{in the study of the}} conventional ring spinning triangle, but may not be appropriate for modified ring spinning systems in which the yarn spinning tension has an obvious angle with the vertical axis perpendicular to the nip line. Thus in this paper a new theoretical model is proposed by considering the inclination angle of the spinning tension. Based on the principle of minimum potential energy, the theoretical model quantitatively describes the fiber tension distribution and its relationships with the spinning parameters, shape of the spinning triangle and the inclination angle of yarn spinning tension. As an application of the proposed method, spinning triangles of a modified ring spinning system were investigated under various spinning parameters. The fiber tension distributions in the spinning triangle both with and without fiber buckling were numerically simulated and the results were compared with those from our earlier model. In addition, the properties of spun yarns produced by the modified system were evaluated and analyzed. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to numerically {{investigate}} one source of acoustic noise in roller bearings, that which results from the motion <b>of</b> the <b>rollers</b> in the bearing under zero exter-nal load. For the sake of simplification, it was assumed that the cylindrical roller bearings are infinitely long. Furthermore, the effects of the following on the noise of the bearing were also examined: the radial clearance of the bearing, the viscosity of the lubricant, and the number <b>of</b> <b>rollers.</b> The results <b>of</b> the study show that the fundamental frequency of the noise components <b>of</b> the cylindrical <b>roller</b> bearing corresponds to the multiplica-tion of the number <b>of</b> <b>rollers</b> and the whirling frequency <b>of</b> the <b>roller</b> center. The acoustical frequency spectra <b>of</b> the cylindrical <b>roller</b> bearing are pure tone spectra, containing the fundamental frequency <b>of</b> the <b>roller</b> bearing and its superharmonics.

Under different magnitude loads, the reasonable combination of interference magnitude with the hollowness can not only increase the stiffness <b>of</b> <b>roller</b> bearings, but also decrease the maximum stress <b>of</b> <b>rollers,</b> which provides a reference for the design and manufacture <b>of</b> pre-loaded cylindrical <b>roller</b> bearings...|$|R
