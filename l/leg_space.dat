50|$|The {{instrument}} panel gained darker features and redesigned graphics for the gauges. To create more <b>leg</b> <b>space</b> in the cabin, a protrusion {{from the door}} pockets was eliminated.|$|E
40|$|To {{minimize}} the ohmic power losses, {{it is necessary}} to maximize the transverse shunt resistance, R shunt. The cell of a rod-type RFQ is modelled by a parallel two-rod transmission line supported above a parallel ground conductor by two legs. Due to coupling between neighbouring supports, the loading impedance is modified depending on the <b>leg</b> <b>spacing.</b> The shunt resistance is improved by reducing the cell length and increasing the <b>leg</b> <b>spacing,</b> and maximized when the <b>legs</b> are equally <b>spaced.</b> However, this is also the condition for strong excitation of the unwanted `even-mode' in which a potential difference exists between the ends of the rods mid-plane and the grounding conductor or tank. Once the legs of the support are longitudinally separated, some even-mode excitation of the structure is inevitable because some current must be injected into the ground conductor; the even-mode excitation rises as leg separation increases. Further, when the desired odd-mode voltage is symmetric about [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Fixed length {{legs were}} also seen on older instruments. Instrument height was {{adjusted}} {{by changing the}} angle of the <b>legs.</b> Widely <b>spaced</b> tripod feet resulted in a lower instrument while closely <b>spaced</b> <b>legs</b> raised the instrument. This was considerably less convenient than having variable length legs.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{reports the}} {{experimental}} results of compressive tests on concrete cylinders wrapped by aramid fibre spirals. Both circular concrete cylinders {{with a single}} spiral and rectangular concrete specimens with two interlocking spirals are investigated. Concentric compression tests were carried out. It {{was found that the}} behaviour of confined concrete is influenced not only by the concrete strength, but also the spiral <b>leg</b> <b>spacing</b> and the degree of interlocking. Concrete cylinders with close spacing and a high degree of interlocking usually gave higher strength and ductility. Experimental results are compared with analytical data...|$|R
50|$|A long-wheelbase version {{lengthened}} by 4 in {{was also}} made available in September 1957, outwardly {{very similar to}} the existing car but offering improved <b>leg</b> <b>space</b> for rear-seat passengers.|$|E

50|$|The howdahs were {{a kind of}} two-compartment wooden seat (mostly {{covered with}} gold and silver {{embossed}} sheets), which were fastened onto the elephant's back. The front compartment, with more <b>leg</b> <b>space</b> and a raised protective metal sheet, was meant for kings or royalty, and the rear smaller one for a reliable bodyguard disguised as a fly-whisk attendant.|$|E
30|$|Re-installing a spudcan {{very close}} to or {{partially}} overlapping existing footprints is generally not recommended in the guidelines (SNAME OC- 7 panel. 2007; Hossain and Randolph 2008). In a situation where this is inevitable, the guidelines recommend {{the use of an}} identical jack-up (same footing geometries and <b>leg</b> <b>spacing)</b> and locating it in exactly the same position as the previous unit, where possible. However, it is unlikely that two jack-up units have an identical design because the structures of most units are often custom-made and the deployments of units are subject to availability. It is evident that existing guidelines are not adequate for rig operators to install jack-up units in close proximity to existing footprints safely.|$|R
25|$|After the ST-M {{came the}} ST-3, a {{substantial}} redesign in 1941 partly {{brought about by}} the unreliability of the Menasco engines fitted to STs to that point. The United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) had purchased several dozen ST-M variants under various designations and had Ryan Aeronautical re-engine most with Kinner R-440 radial engines. The USAAC found the modification to be beneficial and asked Ryan Aeronautical to design a variant with this engine as standard, and with airframe modifications considered desirable from in-service experience. The ST-3 that resulted featured a longer and more circular wider fuselage, this being suggested by the circular radial engine. Other changes included a revised rudder, balanced ailerons and elevators, and strengthened main landing gear with the <b>legs</b> <b>spaced</b> further apart. The streamlining spats covering the mainwheels, found on ST series aircraft to that point, were deleted as well. The ST-3 served as the basis for military versions ordered by the USAAC and the United States Navy (USN).|$|R
50|$|In some Russian space suits, {{strips of}} cloth were wrapped tightly around the cosmonaut's arms and <b>legs</b> outside the <b>space</b> suit {{to stop the}} space suit from {{ballooning}} when in space.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantage}} of the mobile operating table, on the other hand, is that {{the position of the}} table can be changed within the operating room. However, the foot of the table limits the <b>leg</b> <b>space</b> available to the surgical team. The individual segments of the table top can be easily removed and replaced. They also permit x-rays and conduct electricity.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the table}} column for a {{stationary}} operating table system is firmly {{anchored to the}} floor, the additional necessary medical devices can easily {{be brought to the}} operating area and positioned.These devices include, for example, x-ray equipment, which can easily be slid under the table top. For personnel, the system offers improved <b>leg</b> <b>space</b> since disruptive foot geometry is no longer present.|$|E
50|$|As such, gateleg {{tables are}} {{a subset of the}} type known as a dropleaf. The hinged section, or flap, was {{supported}} on pivoted legs joined at the top and bottom by stretchers constituting a gate. Large flaps had two supports, which had the advantage of providing freer <b>leg</b> <b>space</b> in the centre. The earliest gateleg tables of the 16th and 17th century were typically made of oak.|$|E
50|$|A xorn is {{described}} as having a barrel-shaped body with trilateral radial symmetry; three arms, <b>legs</b> and eyes <b>spaced</b> around its torso. The mouth {{is located at the}} top of the body.|$|R
5000|$|Wings: Areas {{that are}} part of a stage deck but offstage (out of sight of the audience). The wings are {{typically}} masked with <b>legs.</b> The wing <b>space</b> is used for performers preparing to enter, storage of sets for scenery changes and as a stagehand work area. Wings also contain technical equipment, such as the fly system.|$|R
50|$|This type of {{scaffold}} {{is generally}} used where unlimited versatility is required. In many countries, {{it is common}} in construction. Horizontal tubes (and thus walking-decks) can be placed at any height along the vertical tube (as permitted by engineering constraints), and vertical tubes, or <b>legs,</b> can be <b>spaced</b> at any distance apart, up to the maximum distance allowed by engineering constraints.|$|R
5000|$|Isuzu new rugged ladder-frame chassis {{platform}} dubbed [...] "i-GRIP" [...] (Isuzu Gravity Responsive Intelligent Platform) underpinning the new D-Max makes 42% {{stronger than}} its predecessors leading to improved ride and handling. The frame includes improved cross bracing at the rear, improving stability under loads and while towing, while also [...] "ensuring long-term durability when used regularly in harsh environments". Longer wheelbase of 3095mm - 45mm longer than before - is now standard {{on all three}} body styles. This {{is good news for}} double cab users as rear riders not only get more <b>leg</b> <b>space</b> but also more comfortable seats.|$|E
5000|$|The {{response}} on the Adtranz's second generation trams was not successful on the market. Only Munich and Nuremberg ordered this type. Except for being renewed {{with the latest}} technology, it also featured a larger distance between the axles knows to this material (2 meters instead of 1.85 meter) so that the <b>leg</b> <b>space</b> {{on top of the}} bogies could be increased. Another difference is, which there here really talk is not of a 4-moduled tram (as the one provided to Bremen), but previously of two double-modulated trams. In the middle, the articulation has been lengthened and redesigned, so that the movements of the first and last two modules couldn't influence each other. Because of this swinging the modules is limited at - and driving out the arcs.|$|E
5000|$|Nerds were {{a popular}} candy in the 1980s, {{but they had}} big {{competitors}} including Pop Rocks, Candy Buttons, and Mike and Ike’s. Nerds also had a close cousin in the '80s—Dweebs. Dweebs were very similar to Nerds; but they were less sour and bigger in size. One {{of the most popular}} differences is that Dweebs contained three flavors instead of two, though the United Kingdom had a box of nerds with three flavors for a limited time. According to Rob Bricken, [...] "A squishier Nerd with more <b>leg</b> <b>space</b> and a surprise in the middle, Dweebs were more substantial, less sour, and displayed a greater depth and complexity than Nerds." [...] Dweebs only lasted a short time on the market, however.|$|E
2500|$|Swiss stated: [...] "The {{customer}} {{feedback is}} very positive with the expected remarks concerning the bright cabin, reduced noise, enough <b>leg</b> room and <b>space</b> for hand luggage {{as well as}} the comfortable seats. Also the feedback from our pilots is gratifying. They especially like the intuitive flying experience." [...] AirBaltic lauded lower noise levels for passengers and more space for luggage than its Boeing 737-300s.|$|R

No danger of my starving, is there?" [...] whispered Corny, as he leaned over to Chris, who sat, apparently, on nothing, with his long <b>legs</b> {{dangling}} into <b>space.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The SCS {{utilizes}} {{active control}} using 6 servo-actuated <b>legs</b> from RUAG <b>Space</b> (Switzerland) which are coordinated {{to control the}} SCS ring in its 6 degrees of freedom. The leg forces are measured to modify the compliance of the SCS ring to facilitate alignment of the active platform during capture. A large range of vehicle mass properties can be handled. Mechanical latches achieve soft capture.|$|R
50|$|The styling of the Series III {{which the}} Rootes Group {{announced}} in October 1960 was distinguishable by its four headlights and revised full-width grille. This Snipe {{was the first}} British car to fit two pairs of headlamps. The suspension of the car had been considerably modified along with the car's floor structure which improved the car's high speed stability. The {{front of the car}} was redesigned to give a lower bonnet line. The nose of the car was also lengthened by 3.25 in to accommodate an additional pulley, mounted {{on the front of the}} crankshaft, that enabled air conditioning to be included as an option, principally for the North American market. Separate ducts were provided for heating and cooling air to the passenger compartment. The engine received improved bearings with a changed lubrication system and was given better cooling with a quieter fan. Seats were redesigned to give more <b>leg</b> <b>space</b> for back seat passengers.|$|E
5000|$|The Comète {{combined}} the elegant {{style of a}} body by Facel with the mechanical underpinnings of the Ford Vedette combined with a shortened wheelbase. [...] The rear seat was stylishly designed, especially on the upmarket [...] "Monte-Carlo" [...] version with its two-colour leather seat covers, but nevertheless offered insufficient <b>leg</b> <b>space</b> for adults, other than on the shortest and most unavoidable of journeys. [...] The economy was beginning to grow robustly by the mid-1950s, but the market capacity for cars of this size remained small and Comète sales were correspondingly modest. Above all, it was handicapped by a list price that was (in October 1953) 65% higher than that for the mechanically similar Vedette. [...] Customers interested in the larger engined 3,923 cc versions were faced with a price for the [...] "Monte-Carlo" [...] (once it became available {{at the start of}} 1954) that was 51% higher than that of the spacious four door Vendôme.|$|E
5000|$|The M30 had no or {{very few}} factory options, but dealers offered the {{addition}} of a cellular phone and a CD player/changer. The sole engine was Nissan's VG30E, a 3.0 L SOHC V6 that produced 162 hp (121 kW) and 180 lb·ft (244 N·m) of torque, also used by many previous Nissan models such as the Maxima and 300ZX. Like the 300ZX, the M30 was a front-engine and rear-wheel drive vehicle. The transmission was Nissan's RE4R01A four-speed automatic with overdrive, as enabled or disabled by a button on the shifter. There was no option of a manual transmission. The differential was a Nissan R200-type open differential. It is generally regarded among M30 enthusiasts that the change of powertrain, weak suspension and the lack of options in these categories was a mistake on Infiniti's part and perhaps to blame for the lackluster sales. This was the enthusiasts' theory. The M30 was a Japanese car designed for the Japanese market. When it came to America, there was very little change. This included head room and <b>leg</b> <b>space.</b> Adding to the theory of [...] "lackluster performance" [...] was the enthusiasts bias towards motor swapping and sport performance. The M30 was a luxury car. In Japan, the Nissan Leopard trim levels of XS and XJ were equipped with VG20E motors. When Infiniti introduced the M30 convertible, this became the popular version to purchase. The M30 (coupe) weighed about 3300 lbs (1498 kg), and produced [...] The M30 convertible weighed approximately 200 lbs. more, due to body and chassis reinforcements.|$|E
5000|$|In August 2016, Swiss {{reported}} [...] "much higher" [...] reliability {{than other}} new aircraft, citing Airbus’ A380, A320neo and Boeing’s 787, with an airline spokesperson stating: [...] "The customer feedback is very positive with the expected remarks concerning the bright cabin, reduced noise, enough <b>leg</b> room and <b>space</b> for hand luggage {{as well as}} the comfortable seats.

40|$|The present work is {{concerned}} with developing a discretized analytical model to investigate {{the effect of a}} backfill on the performance of a vertical U-tube ground-coupled heat pump. This work involves the development of an analytical solution and an expression for the equivalent diameter, and the experimental verification of their applications in the system model. The approximate analytical solution was developed to the transient heat? conduction problem in an infinite composite medium composed of a backfill and the soil with an internal cylindrical heat source. This was intended to improve the prediction of the performance of a U-tube ground heat exchanger. The generalized orthogonal expansion technique was utilized in deriving this solution. Solutions are presented {{in a wide range of}} the Fourier number for the non-dimensional temperature as a function of the ratios of thermal conductivities and diffusivities of the backfill and soil Sensitivities of the results to assumptions about the sizes of the backfilling region and the far-field boundary were also examined. To verify the correctness of the solution, comparisons were made between this solution, and the classical homogeneous cylindrical solution and a finite difference solution [...] To improve the equivalent diameter approach to the thermal interference problem between the legs of the U-tube, a general expression for the equivalent diameter was derived under steady state. The transient analytical solution, developed earlier combined with the superposition method and the conformal mapping technique were used to justify this expression. A small-scale U-tube test facility was constructed for the experimental validation of the system model of the U-tube heat exchanger using the analytical solution and the equivalent diameter expression. Two types of backfill materials: bentonite/masonry sand and bentonite/copper powder were chosen for the tests. Finally, the parametric studies were conducted to characterize the effects of the thermal properties of the backfill, the <b>leg</b> <b>spacing</b> as well as the size of the backfill region. A backfill effectiveness was proposed and discussed. These studies provide a number of insights into the heat transfer behavior of the U-tube heat exchanger buried in a non? homogeneous medium...|$|R
50|$|The Continental R Mulliner model range, offered from March 1999, was {{introduced}} at the Geneva Motor Show. The Bentley Continental R Mulliner {{was equipped with}} the most powerful engine after the Continental T. This engine had a power output of 420 hp (313 kW) and a maximum torque of 650 lb·ft (881 N·m). The car could be pushed to {{a top speed of}} some 170 mph (274 km/h). 0-60 mph (97 km/h) times dropped to 5.6 seconds with the computer nannies left on, and if an owner was willing to shred their tires for 50 or more yards, capable of 5.1 second times with the traction control off and abusive driving practices. One of the reasons the Continental R Mulliner came to life, was some customers(wanting the T) need for the longer <b>leg</b> room <b>space</b> offered in the R. The T was 4 inches shorter.|$|R
40|$|A {{retracting}} {{keyboard and}} monitor platform is provided. By using a lift mechanism a monitor is lifted, vertically, {{from the back}} of the desk. When a user is done the screen retracts and disappears. Installation of the device requires that an opening be cut in the back of the desk. One advantage to this concept is the increased work surface. Also, when a flat panel monitor is used a minimum of <b>leg</b> <b>space</b> is lost on the underside of the desk...|$|E
40|$|The Anthropometric Source Book was {{developed}} based on Johnson Space Center project of anthropometry, {{the study of}} the size, shape and motion characteristics of the human body. Designed primarily for use by NASA, the military services and aerospace contractors, the book was also intended to help non-aerospace engineers, architects, and others engaged in design of clothing, equipment and workplaces. An example of its use by Eastman Kodak Company is the company's application of the data to design efficient, productive and comfortable workplaces for employees in the Rochester, NY processing laboratories. The sourcebook was used to determine such dimensions as <b>leg</b> <b>space,</b> work surface height and thickness, employee reach distances, proper height for computer terminal screen, seat height and knee space...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} of what makes people rise to power has long puzzled social scientists. Here we examined the novel hypothesis that power is afforded to individuals who exhibit prosocial norm violations-i. e., breaking rules {{for the benefit of}} others. Three experiments using different methods provide support for this idea. Individuals who deliberately ignored a prohibition to tilt a bus chair (Study 1; scenario) or to close a window (Study 2; film clip) were afforded more power than individuals who obeyed the rules, but only when the norm violation benefited others (i. e., by giving them more <b>leg</b> <b>space</b> or fresh air). Study 2 further showed that this effect was mediated by perceived social engagement, which was highest among prosocial norm violators. In Study 3 (face-to-face), a confederate who stole coffee from the experimenter's desk was afforded more power than a confederate who took coffee upon invitation, but only when he also offered coffee to the participant. We discuss implications for hierarchy formation, morality, and social engagement. © 2012 Elsevier Inc...|$|E

60|$|Then I {{went through}} rooms of shells and fishes and {{reptiles}} and tortoises, crocodiles and alligators and insects, including {{all manner of}} butterflies, some of which had wings precisely like leaves, a little withered and faded, even the skeleton and fibres of the leaves represented; and immense hairy spiders, covering, with the whole circumference of their <b>legs,</b> a <b>space</b> {{as big as a}} saucer; and centipedes little less than a foot long; and winged insects that look like jointed twigs of a tree. In America, I remember, when I lived in Lenox, I found an insect of this species, and at first really mistook it for a twig. It was smaller than these specimens in the Museum. I suppose every creature, almost, that runs or creeps or swims or flies, is represented in this collection of Natural History; and it puzzles me to think what they were all made for, though it is quite as mysterious why man himself was made.|$|R
50|$|The {{new stadium}} was {{constructed}} in 2013 and into early-mid 2014 {{on the site of}} the former Ivor Wynne Stadium, which was demolished in the process, and it opened for Canadian Football League (CFL) football in late 2014. The stadium currently seats approximately 24,000 spectators for Canadian football, with expansion potential to boost capacity to more than 40,000 seats for special events (such as hosting a Grey Cup contest) in the future. The design of the new stadium also increased the width of the field to meet FIFA's international standards for association football pitches; reoriented the playing field to a north-south orientation (in contrast to its former east-west orientation); increased the seat width and <b>leg</b> room/corridor <b>space</b> to make it one of the most spacious among Canadian sports venues; incorporated extensive wireless communications infrastructure and state of the art washroom facilities, as well as luxury boxes, and other modern amenities. The stadium field surface is FIFA- and CFL-approved artificial turf.|$|R
