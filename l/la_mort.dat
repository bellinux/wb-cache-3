25|$|Lepidus {{appears in}} several 18th century French plays, such as Prosper Jolyot de Crébillon's Le Triumvirat, ou <b>la</b> <b>mort</b> de Cicéron, {{in which he}} {{attempts}} to save Cicero's life, and is portrayed as a conflicted figure, who respects traditional Roman values, but is unable to resist the will of his colleagues. Cicero rejects compromise, but Lepidus is too weak to do so. Voltaire's Le Triumvirat refers to Lepidus as a pawn, merely used by Antony and Octavian.|$|E
25|$|In a men's {{basketball}} pool {{match between}} the USA and France, the USA's Vince Carter {{made one of}} the most famous dunks in basketball history.

Carter jumped, spread his legs in midair, scraped Weis' head on the way up, and dunked. The French media dubbed the feat le dunk de <b>la</b> <b>mort</b> ("the dunk of death").|$|E
25|$|Byron's Sardanapalus {{was one of}} the {{literary}} sources – others include Diodorus Siculus and the Roman historian Quintus Curtius Rufus – of Eugène Delacroix' major historical painting <b>La</b> <b>Mort</b> de Sardanapale, completed between November 1827 and January 1828. It depicts the Assyrian king preparing for death surrounded by concubines, rather than in the company of Myrrha alone as Byron would have it. Thereafter the death of Sardanapalus became a favourite subject for composers, especially in France. In 1830 competitors for the Paris Conservatoire's Prix de Rome were given J.-F. Gail's <b>La</b> <b>Mort</b> de Sardanapale, a text based on Byron's play and Delacroix' painting, to set as a cantata. Hector Berlioz, in his fourth attempt on the prize, took the first prize. In the mid-1840s Franz Liszt conceived the idea of writing an opera based on Sardanapalus, and procured an Italian libretto to that purpose, but he did not actually begin writing until 1849, and seems to have given the project up during 1851. Though his opera was never finished, 111 pages of sketches for it still survive in Weimar's Liszt Museum. Several other Sardanapale operas based on Byron's play were completed by the composers Victorin de Joncières, Alphonse Duvernoy, Giulio Alary, and the Baronne de Maistre, and one was projected by the young Ildebrando Pizzetti. In 1901 the Prix de Rome committee selected Fernand Beissier's Myrrha, a pale imitation of Sardanapalus, as the text to be set. The prize was won by André Caplet on this occasion, but Maurice Ravel's entry {{is the only one of}} the 1901 entries to remain in the repertoire.|$|E

25|$|The 1920/1921 {{season at}} the Vieux-Colombier began with popular re-runs from {{previous}} season, opening with Vildrac's Le Paquebot Tenacity followed by Nuit des rois, which Parisians had {{not seen since the}} end of the first season in 1914. The highly demanding Vieux-Colombier audiences were happy to see fine performances of classics under the deft direction of Copeau. Critics, though, wondered when new plays would be on the bill. In January, Copeau staged Henri Ghéon's Le Pauvre sous l'escalier ("The Beggar under the Staircase"), the story based on the medieval tale of the life of Saint Alexis. <b>La</b> <b>Mort</b> de Sparte ("The Death of Sparta"), a play by Copeau's friend Jean Schlumberger dating from before the war, garnered neither critical nor popular praise.|$|E
25|$|La Comédie de <b>la</b> <b>Mort,</b> {{published}} in 1838, {{is a period}} piece much like Albertus. In this work, Gautier focuses {{on the theme of}} death, which for Gautier is a terrifying, stifling and irreversible finality. Unlike many Romantics before him, Gautier's vision of death is solemn and portentous, proclaiming death as the definitive escape from life's torture. During the time he wrote the work, Gautier was frequenting many cemeteries, which were then expanding rapidly to accommodate the many deaths from epidemics that swept the country. Gautier translates death into a curiously heady, voluptuous, almost exhilarating experience which diverts him momentarily from the gruesome reality and conveys his urgent plea for light over darkness, life over death. Several of these poems have been set as melodies by composers such as Berlioz, Bizet, Fauré, and Duparc.|$|E
25|$|Erik Satie, Arthur Honegger, Darius Milhaud and {{the other}} members of The Group of Six in Paris never made any secret of their sympathy for ragtime, which is {{sometimes}} evident in their works. Consider, in particular, the ballet of Satie, Parade (Ragtime du Paquebot), (1917) and <b>La</b> <b>Mort</b> de Monsieur Mouche, an overture for piano for a drama in three acts, composed in the early 1900s in memory of his friend J.P. Contamine de Latour. In 1902 the American cakewalk was very popular in Paris and Satie two years later wrote two rags, La Diva de l'empire and Piccadilly. Despite the two Anglo-Saxon settings, the tracks appear American-inspired. La Diva de l'empire, a march for piano soloist, was written for Paulette Darty and initially bore the title Stand-Walk Marche; it was later subtitled Intermezzo Americain when Rouarts-Lerolle reprinted it in 1919. Piccadilly, another march, was initially titled The Transatlantique; it presented a stereotypical wealthy American heir sailing on an ocean liner on the New York–Europe route, going to trade his fortune for an aristocratic title in Europe. There is a similar influence in Milhaud's ballets Le boeuf sur le toite and Creation du Monde, which he wrote after a trip to Harlem during his trip in 1922. Even the Swiss composer Honegger wrote works in which the influence of African American music is pretty obvious. Examples include Pacific 231, Prélude et Blues and especially the Concertino for piano and orchestra.|$|E

25|$|Morgan {{concentrates}} on witchcraft to such degree that {{she goes to}} live in seclusion in the exile of far-away forests. She learns more spells than any other woman, gains an ability to transform herself into any animal, and people begin to call her Morgan the Goddess. Lancelot has a vision of Hell where Morgan still {{will be able to}} control demons even in afterlife as they torture Guinevere. After Mordred spots the images of Lancelot's passionate love for Guinevere that Lancelot painted on her castle's walls while he was imprisoned there, Morgan shows them to Gawain and his brothers, encouraging them to take action in the name of loyalty to their king, but they do not do this. In the Vulgate <b>La</b> <b>Mort</b> le Roi Artu (The Death of King Arthur, also known as just Mort Artu), Morgan vanishes {{for a long time and}} stops troubling Arthur, who assumes her to be dead. One day, he wanders into Morgan's remote castle while on a hunting trip, and they instantly reconcile with each other. Morgan welcomes him warmly and the king is overjoyed of their reunion and allows her to return to Camelot, but she refuses and declares her plan to move to the Isle of Avalon to live there with other sorceresses. However, the sight of Lancelot's frescoes and Morgan's confession finally convinces Arthur about the truth to the rumours of the two's secret love affair (about which he has been already warned by his nephew Sir Agravain). This leads to a great conflict between Arthur and Lancelot, which brings down the fellowship of the Round Table. The goddess Fortune, who appears to Arthur to foretell his death towards the end the Vulgate Cycle, is regarded by some as a double for Morgan. At the end of Mort Artu, Morgan is the first among the black-hooded ladies who take the dying Arthur to his final rest in Avalon.|$|E
