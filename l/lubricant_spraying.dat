40|$|The paper {{describes}} the experimental and numerical investigation aimed at estimating the temperature profile inside the die during the spraying of the lubricant. The analysis {{is focused on}} the determination of the heat transfer coefficient between the die and the lubricant. The work has been carried out in two main phases: i) the design and setting up of the testing apparatus to simulate in a laboratory scale the die lubrication process, and ii) the development of an automatic inverse analysis technique based on FEM to identify the heat transfer coefficient. A cylindrical specimen equipped with twelve thermocouples at three different depths is heated up and then cooled by the <b>lubricant</b> <b>spraying.</b> The inverse analysis for the determination of the heat transfer coefficient based on a 2 D FEM code operates on the assumption of two-dimensional heat flow. The heat transfer coefficient is evaluated by minimising the difference between the measured temperatures and those evaluated by the FE analysis...|$|E
40|$|High-pressure {{die casting}} of zinc alloys is {{increasingly}} {{used in the}} manufacturing of parts with high aesthetic value. These parts must comply with strict requirements on surface quality, which are generally overlooked in traditional mechanical applications. Cold flow defects, which are a primary concern for surface quality, originate from several different causes {{that have not yet}} been fully understood. This report investigates the factors that influence cold flow defects and the choices that can lead to an improvement in surface quality. The research method is based on a case study performed at a die casting company. First, an existing process has been analyzed using simulation to explain the causes of cold flow defects observed in production samples. The temperature {{at the end of the}} cavity fill has emerged as a key index for the occurrence of defects, which can be controlled by three primary process parameters: injection velocity, temperature of the cooling medium, and <b>lubricant</b> <b>spraying</b> time. These same factors are then assessed using experimental tests on an existing die, where the number of defects in the selected regions of the casting has been evaluated by image processing. The results suggest that the surface quality can be particularly improved by increasing the flow rate of the molten metal through the gates and avoiding excessive flow turbulence in the wide cavity sections. Consequently, the increase in the gate area has been identified as a specific criterion for the die design. These findings have been validated in the redesign of the die and the selection of the process parameters, which have resulted in a significant reduction in the surface defects...|$|E
40|$|In the {{traditional}} approach the numerical simulation of the forging process is mainly focused on the filling of the dies, optimising the geometry of dies and preforms, in order to minimise scrapped material, loading on the dies and material flow defects. Some assumptions are frequently adopted such as the uniform or quasi-uniform initial temperature of the dies, the possibility to neglect the dies lubrication phase, the changes of die material behaviour as concerns strength, hardness, toughness due to fatigue phenomena. In order to overcome some of these limitations a forging cycle has been reproduced in laboratory conditions and monitored using a 250 tons screw press equipped with modified dies embedding thermocouples at different locations near the contact surface of the dies, {{as well as with}} strain gauges to measure forging forces. The purpose was a collection of reliable data on temperature field evolution and total forging load during the forging cycles, including loading of the billet, forging, unloading of the forged parts, lubricating the dies. These data have been used to set up and refine a numerical simulation of the whole process, developing and validating a reliable model of the phase relevant to the spraying of the lubricant on the die surface. The results of this improved numerical simulation can be summarised as follows: i) determination of the effective thermal field in the dies, ii) evaluation of the number of forging cycles required to reach a steady thermal field before the forging of the component, iii) a numerical model of the <b>lubricant</b> <b>spraying</b> suitable to be applied in the analysis of industrial forging processes...|$|E

40|$|Whilst modern {{cylinder}} lubricant {{delivery systems}} claim {{to provide the}} ability to reduce oil consumption in marine engines, and offer a more efficient control of liner wear and corrosion, {{there is a need}} to better understand the effect of physical properties on oil spray formation and liner coverage. To this end, we built an optical spray chamber and applied optical diagnostics to characterise the sprays produced by a modern, commercial, high-pressure <b>lubricant</b> <b>spray</b> system. We used high-speed video to visualise: the lubricant flow inside a custom-built optical nozzle; the near-nozzle jet; the far-field spray; and the subsequent coverage of a transparent liner. We found that the lubricant injection system showed evidence of internal cavitation. Further investigation of this cavitation was carried out through the use of an optical nozzle, replicating the internal geometry of the lubricant injector. The optical nozzle's refractive index was matched to that of the lubricant, allowing vapour pockets to be clearly visible. The transparent cylinder liner enabled the measurement of liner spreadability and coverage patterns. Changes in these patterns were linked to lubricant viscosity. Our preliminary results demonstrate the possibility to relate the internal nozzle flow to lubricant atomisation and, ultimately, to liner coverag...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Lubricant</b> <b>spray</b> {{application}} {{experiments were}} {{conducted for the}} die casting process. The heat flux was measured in situ using a differential thermopile sensor for three application techniques. First, the lubricant was applied under a constant flowrate while the nozzle {{was held in the}} same position. Second, the lubricant was applied in a pulsed, static manner, in which the nozzle was held over the same surface while it was turned on and off several times. Third, the lubricant was applied in a sweeping manner, in which the nozzle was moved along the die surface while it was held open. The experiments were conducted at several die tem-peratures and at sweep speeds of 20, 23, and 68 cm/s. The heat flux data, which were obtained with a sensor that was located in the centre of the test plate, were presented and discussed. The sensor can be used to evaluate lubricants, monitor the consistency of die lubrication process, and obtain useful process data, such as surface temperature, heat flux, and heat transfer coefficients. The heat removed from the die surface during lubricant application is necessary for (a) designing the cooling channels in the die, i. e. their size and placement, and (b) performing accurate numerical simulations of the die casting process...|$|R

The advantage of this method over previous techniques is that it allows the differentiation of lubricants in a more controlled operating environment and evaluates the overall lubricant performance as opposed to individual properties.

Chain length and component masses were also taken before and after running the chains and sprockets under load on the test rig. The results clearly show that any lubricant is preferable to none.

Materials and methods: The crown of extracted, caries-free human molars was transversally sectioned with a model trimmer to prepare the dentin surfaces from mid-coronal sound dentin, and then uniformly abraded with # 600 silicon carbide paper. The dentin surfaces were randomly divided into three groups: oil-free spray group where maintenance cleaner for air bearing handpieces was sprayed onto the dentin surface for 1 s and rinsed with water spray for 30 s; oil-containing spray group where maintenance cleaner for micro motor handpieces was sprayed onto the dentin surface for 1 s and rinsed with water spray for 30 s; and control group where the surface was rinsed with water spray for 30 s and then air-dried. These surfaces were then bonded with Clearfil SE Bond (Kuraray Medical), and resin composite (Clearfil AP-X, Kuraray Medical) build-up crowns were incrementally constructed on the bonded surfaces. After storage for 24 h in 37 &deg;C water, the bonded teeth were sectioned into hour-glass shaped slices (0. 7 -mm thick) perpendicular to the bonded surfaces. The specimens were then subjected to microtensile bond strength (&mu;TBS) testing at a crosshead speed of 1. 0 mm/min. Data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA and the Tukey-Kramer test.

40|$|In high {{pressure}} die casting, {{it is necessary}} to apply a lubricant {{to the surface of the}} die in order to prevent soldering and decrease the cycle time of the casting process. The traditional approach uses a continuous spraying method to apply the lubricant; this can be wasteful. The purpose of this study was to examine the ability of a pulse spray application process to apply die lubricant onto the die surface. A previous study at Purdue University concluded that the pulsed spray method of die lubricant application could result in a significant reduction of the amount of spray runoff and consumption of die lubricant, leading to large cost reductions. The study examined the cooling rates and the resulting temperature differences for different spray pressures and frequencies. After spraying, the affected area of the surface was examined, and the number of particles and coverage area of the particles were measured. The parameters adjusted for this study were the spray pressure, spray duration, and the surface temperature of the hot plate. It was found that a spray pressure of 20 psi does not apply lubricant effectively at 400 °C at one, two, or four seconds of spray. At 400 °C, {{it is necessary to}} have a longer spray duration to apply die <b>lubricant</b> with a <b>spray</b> pressure of 20 psi.

30|$|As {{more and}} more {{nanomaterials}} are introduced in our daily life, serious environmental hazard could occur. Copper nanoparticles (CNPs) {{are one of the}} first engineered nanoparticles (NPs) involved in a variety of industrial applications, such as facial <b>spray,</b> <b>lubricants</b> additive, metallic coating, and inks [1]. Effluent, spillage during shipping, and handling are considered as the main routes of entry for CNPs to human body [2]. Regarding their small size and high reactivity, various studies showed that CNPs could causes a diversity of toxic effects including hepatotoxicity [3, 4]. Chen et al. [4] reported that CNPs’ toxicity is triggered by reactive oxygen species (ROS) over production. Usually, cells respond to oxidative burden through fortifying their antioxidant defense mechanism. However, the imbalance between oxidative burden and defense mechanism induces protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation (LPO), DNA damage, and apoptosis [5, 6]. Recently, much interest had been focused on the role of naturally occurred herbal plant extracts as protective agents for various toxins [7]. Green tea extract (GTE) had attracted a great attention for its health benefits against a variety of toxins associated with oxidative stress [7, 8]. Many studies proved the hepatoprotective role of GTE [9, 10]. The great beneficial influence of GTE was attributed to the high content of catechins. Epicatechin, epicatechin gallate (ECG), epigallocatechin (EGC), and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) are the major catechins present in GTE [11]. Those catechins chemically possess multiple hydroxyl substituents responsible for its antioxidant activity [12]. Besides catechins, GTE contains additional antioxidants such as vitamins E and C [13], as well as minerals that function as co-factors for antioxidant enzymes. The discovery of novel protective agents against NPs’ toxicity remains a challenge. Therefore, regarding the mentioned impacts of GTE, as a strong hepatoprotective antioxidant, the present study was designed to evaluate the ameliorative influence of the GTE against CNP-induced hepatotoxicity in male rats.|$|R
40|$|Defects and {{imperfections}} are intrinsically {{generated by}} casting processes, due to several reasons. The final properties and in-service behaviour of castings are always related to microstructural features and to defects and imperfections: both microstructure and defects/imperfections {{are the results}} of process stages, alloys properties and dies & tools design. As an example, it should be considered that in HPDC filling stage extreme conditions are established: complexity of components leads to complex dies, and the high production rates required (up to 120 shots/h) lead to very high filling velocities for the molten alloy (up to 40 m/s) with strong generation of turbulence in the flow. Solidification takes place in few seconds, and the die is first in contact with a molten alloy at more than 700 °C and, after 30 - 40 seconds, with a <b>sprayed</b> <b>lubricant</b> at room temperature. For these reasons HPDC (as well as other Aluminium alloys casting processes, such as permanent mould casting process) {{can be considered a}} “defect generating process”. Not only an average 5 - 10 % scrap is typically produced, but the type, size and severity of defects and imperfections are varying. From these considerations, it seems that the potential of high-pressure die-casting and permanent mould casting processes will be completely exploited only when the quality level will be perfectly optimised. In this regard, the analysis of defects and imperfections allows the foundry to monitor the products quality respect to a quality standard. Further, the analysis of defects and imperfections provide to the foundry useful correlations between their type/distribution and their origin, so that it could be possible to define process modification for improving the quality. One of the current targets of the StaCast project is the compilation and dissemination of common tools to allow foundries to define a proper, comparable, quality standard. The first tool to be proposed is a common basis of language, i. e. a terminology and classification of defects and imperfections in order to help die-casting foundries to face with increased confidence and ability the defect-related issues, to assure quality and reliability of their products...|$|R
