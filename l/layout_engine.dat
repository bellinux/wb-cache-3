5|$|Epiphany {{initially}} {{used the}} Gecko <b>layout</b> <b>engine</b> from the Mozilla project to display web pages. It provided a GNOME integrated {{graphical user interface}} for Gecko, instead of the Mozilla XUL interface.|$|E
5|$|The {{second major}} {{milestone}} (after version 1.0) in Epiphany development was the 2.14 release. This {{was the first}} Epiphany release which followed GNOME's version numbering. It also featured network awareness using NetworkManager, smart bookmarks-related improvements {{and the possibility of}} being compiled against XULRunner. The latter was critical, as previously Epiphany could only use Firefox or Mozilla/SeaMonkey as a <b>layout</b> <b>engine</b> provider, so it could only be installed alongside one of those browsers. The XULRunner support made it possible to install Epiphany as the sole web browser on the system.|$|E

Others, including Blink, WebKit, and Gecko, are shared {{by a number of}} browsers, such as Google Chrome, Opera, Safari, and Firefox. The different <b>layout</b> <b>engines</b> implement the DOM standards to varying degrees of compliance.|$|R
