30|$|According to {{the work}} in [10], the <b>locating</b> systems can be preliminarily grouped into two major categories: {{receptive}} <b>locating</b> systems and transmissive <b>locating</b> systems. In the receptive <b>locating</b> systems, the position information is distributed ubiquitously, and the mobile device can derive its own location from this information [the global positioning system (GPS) is the most representative example]. The mobile device can independently <b>locate</b> the derived position in a map, so a local service (without revealing its position to a third party) can be easily provided {{on top of this}} <b>locating</b> information, or some value-added services can be obtained by sharing this <b>locating</b> information with others. Conversely, in the transmissive <b>locating</b> systems, the position is derived by a fixed station which either sees the mobile device or receives a beacon from it. The station can transmit the derived <b>locating</b> result back to the device or use it to generate other value-added services. Sub-cell global system for mobile communications or GSM positioning is a prime example employs this approach, which leverages the mobile communication channel beacon. Also hybrid techniques combining these principles are possible, and this paper will actually underline this possibility.|$|R
