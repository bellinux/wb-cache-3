Though his mother wanted him to marry a person of his class, the woman {{remained}} his lover for over fifteen years and gave birth to his son Adeodatus, who was viewed as extremely intelligent by his contemporaries. In 385, Augustine ended his relationship with his lover in order to prepare himself to marry a ten-year-old heiress. (He had to wait for two years because the <b>legal</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> for women was twelve.) By the time he was able to marry her, however, he instead decided to become a celibate priest.|$|E
25|$|Major {{components}} of the reforms included raising the minimum <b>legal</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> to 18 for men and women, establishing joint responsibility for the family among men and women, limiting the terms of polygamy and divorce, and granting women more rights in the negotiation of marriage contracts, among other provisions. Supporters of the reforms point to broad support for them among Moroccan society, especially among women, and cite the new law as a successful example of a progressive reform framed in indigenous, Islamic principles. Critics of the reforms point to the elitist roots of the movements that advocated for the reforms, the influence of Western secular principles, and the many barriers to the law’s implementation within Moroccan society.|$|E

Like many global issues affecting women's health, poverty and gender inequality are root causes, and any campaign to change cultural attitudes has to address these. Child marriage {{is the subject of}} international conventions and agreements such as The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW, 1979) (article 16) and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in 2014 a summit conference (Girl Summit) co-hosted by UNICEF and the UK was held in London (see illustration) to address this issue together with FGM/C.

30|$|We choose 1960 as {{the cutoff}} for two reasons. First, the one-child policy was {{formally}} enacted in 1980, though only the Communist Party members or League members were initially subjected to it. The marriage law effected in 1980 required that men {{should be at}} least 20  years old to get married. Second, the one-child policy became a strictly enforced national policy in the constitution in 1982, while the new marriage law at that time provided an increase in the <b>legal</b> minimum <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> for men (<b>age</b> 22). We use another cutoff of 1956 to address the concern <b>of</b> late <b>marriage</b> or late childbirth, and the results are unchanged.|$|R
50|$|Child {{marriage}} was outlawed in 1929, under Indian law. However, in the British colonial times, the <b>legal</b> minimum <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> {{was set at}} 15 for girls and 18 for boys. Under protests from Muslim organizations in the undivided British India, a personal law Shariat Act was passed in 1937 that allowed child marriages with consent from girl's guardian. After independence and adoption of Indian constitution in 1950, the child marriage act has undergone several revisions. The minimum <b>legal</b> <b>age</b> for marriage, since 1978, has been 18 for women and 21 for men. The child marriage prevention laws have been challenged in Indian courts, with some Muslim Indian organizations seeking no minimum age and that the age matter be left to their personal law. Child marriage is an active political subject {{as well as a}} subject of continuing cases under review in the highest courts of India.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike most Western countries, {{half of the}} US {{states do}} not have a <b>legal</b> minimum <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage.</b> While in most US states, {{individuals}} age 18 have a right to marriage (with two exceptions—Nebraska (19) and Mississippi (21)), all states allow minors to marry in certain circumstances, such as parental consent, judicial consent, pregnancy, or a combination of these situations. Most states allow parties aged 16 and 17 to marry with parental consent alone. In most states, children under 16 can be married too. In the 25 states [...] which have an absolute minimum age set by statute, this age varies between 13 and 17, while in 25 states there is no statutory minimum <b>age</b> if other <b>legal</b> conditions are met. Although in such states there is no set minimum age by statute, the traditional common law minimum age is 14 for boys and 12 for girls - ages which have been confirmed by case law in some states. Over the past 15 years, more than 200,000 minors married in US, and in Tennessee girls as young as 10 were married in 2001.|$|R

2500|$|Moroccan {{women have}} also been active in {{lobbying}} for reforms to the personal status code laws (Mudawana). The Mudawana was initially codified following Morocco's independence from France and {{was used as a}} tool for the state's immediate consolidation of power. Following Mohammed VI's accession to the throne in 1999, reforming the Mudawana was a major platform that guided the early years of his reign. Various women's organizations supported these measures, such as l’Union de l’Action Féminine (UAF) and Association Marocaine pour les Droits des Femmes (ADFM). In 2004, some of the reforms included stricter measures for men wanting to marry additional wives, greater leniency for a divorce initiated by the wife, more equitable inheritance rights for women, and the increase in the <b>legal</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> for women. The reception of these reforms to the Mudawana varied across class lines and the political spectrum. While members of the aforementioned UAF and ADFM championed these measures, various groups, such as the Islamist Al Adl Wa Al Ihsanne opposed these measures, claiming the reforms were [...] "Western-inspired" [...] and rooted in the neoliberal feminist measures of the World Bank.|$|E

50|$|Unlike other Asian countries, Sri Lankan {{women have}} had {{equal access to}} {{education}} {{for many years and}} men and women enjoy similar rates of literacy. In other countries women’s increased access to education and increased presence in the workforce has delayed the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage,</b> but these factors are less influential in Sri Lanka. Typically, Sri Lankans marry later than people in other Asian countries. In 1961, the average <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> was 22 years old, and today the average <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> is 25 years old in Sri Lanka. Muslim women marry earlier than Sinhalese and Tamil women. School attendance is believed to delay the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> because women in school are not considered adults and are not ready for marriage. Birth order also influences <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage.</b> Women with unmarried older sisters tend to marry later because of the tradition that women should marry in their birth order.
