2500|$|A {{strengthening}} of the bridge was completed in 1907 to handle heavier freight trains by engineer Ralph Modjeski, of the famed bridge civil engineering firm Modjeski and Masters, who added a third <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>trusses</b> down the middle, a central girder, and interleaved columns. In 1917–18, the double tracks on the bridge were converted to gantlet track operation to center the weight of heavier NH 2-10-2 steam locomotives. Even so, trains were restricted to 12 miles per hour. [...] In 1959, the gantlet tracks were replaced by a centered single track.|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge is}} riveted and welded steel Warren truss bridge. It was {{completed}} in 1884. The bridge was widened in 1890 by the addition <b>of</b> a third <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>truss</b> on new piers on the upstream side to carry horse trams. In 1915 the bridge was further strengthened to accommodate the extra weight of electric trams and widened to accommodate two cantilever footpaths. Further widening and reconditioning of the bridge took place in 1933, including the addition of four new welded trusses. The bridge is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.|$|R

In analysis, three shapes <b>of</b> <b>truss</b> are choosing which are Warren, Pratt, and Howe truss with pinned and roller support {{at the end of}} the bridge. The design loads which are pedestrian loads are distributed to the joints on bridge deck. A total <b>of</b> three shapes <b>truss</b> with 6 modelled were investigate and analyse using ANSYS+Civi 1 FEM software.

The linear hydrodynamic analysis <b>of</b> <b>truss</b> spar in random sea wave load is necessary for determining the behaviour <b>of</b> <b>truss</b> spar. This understanding is not only important for design <b>of</b> the mooring <b>lines,</b> but also for optimising the truss spar design.

40|$|The {{traditional}} solution <b>of</b> <b>trussed</b> beams is {{with the}} vertical edge struts. But it was shown, that the inclined edge struts are preferable {{from the point of}} view of materials consumption in some cases. The composite trussed beams with the inclined and vertical edge struts were considered. The trussed beams consist from the top and bottom chords, one central vertical and two inclined or vertical edge struts.

40|$|AbstractTumor {{necrosis}} factor-α (TNF-α) induces the {{transcriptional activation}} of numerous genes {{involved in the}} inflammatory response. The recently identified protein TRUSS was investigated for its role in TNF-α-induced activation of c-Jun-NH 2 terminal kinase (JNK) and transcription factor, AP- 1. Ectopic expression <b>of</b> <b>TRUSS</b> activated JNK and AP- 1 in the absence and presence of TNF-α stimulation. The C-terminal region <b>of</b> <b>TRUSS</b> interacted with TNF receptor-associated factor- 2 (TRAF 2) and co-expression of dominant-inhibitory TRAF 2 with TRUSS inhibited AP- 1 activation, suggesting that TRUSS signaling occurs upstream of TRAF 2. Further, a dominant-inhibitory mutant <b>of</b> <b>TRUSS</b> inhibited TNF-α-induced AP- 1 activation. These findings suggest that TRUSS activates JNK in a TRAF 2 -dependent fashion and is involved in TNF-α-induced AP- 1 activation via JNK kinases...|$|R

There {{have been several}} {{ways to deal with}} such optimisation problems, and one of the approaches is an antioptimisation process. The task is to find the optimum solution of common design variables while simultaneously searching for the worst case scenario of those parameters with uncertainties. This paper proposed a metaheuristic based on population-based incremental learning (PBIL) for solving antioptimisation <b>of</b> <b>trusses.</b> The new algorithm is called two-level PBIL which consists of outer and inner loops. Five antioptimisation problems are posed to test the optimiser performance.
