Not long into their apprenticeships, Hawkpaw and Mothpaw see other kits from the nursery pretending to be Tigerstar and kill everybody. They ask Sasha why they acted like that about him. Sasha tells them the truth about him and makes them promise again that that was their <b>little</b> <b>secret.</b>|$|E
500|$|In {{politics}} {{he assumed}} {{the position of}} hard-line opponent of any form of compromise with domestic opponents or the international community. He made <b>little</b> <b>secret</b> of his willingness to succeed Ian Smith as Prime Minister if Smith showed even [...] "the least whiff of surrender," [...] and {{did his best to}} discourage attempts to get the Rhodesians to compromise. When Abel Muzorewa had his passport withdrawn in September 1972 after returning from a successful visit to London, the government did not attempt to counter the rumour that its action was taken following Van der Byl's personal order.|$|E
500|$|Franco {{has said}} [...] "aiding others {{is the key}} to life, the key to {{happiness}} and, as an actor, you can get wrapped up in yourself and your career...A <b>little</b> <b>secret</b> {{is one of the greatest}} ways to break that is to stop thinking about yourself for a second". When Franco was at a point in his life where he wanted to give back but was unsure how, he asked his Spider-Man co-star Kirsten Dunst for advice. At the suggestion of Dunst, he started volunteering at the charity Art of Elysium, where she also volunteers, which helps children with serious medical conditions. He said the experience helped save his life. In January 2011, at the Art of Elysium Heaven Gala in Los Angeles, Franco was honored for his work at the hospital, receiving the Spirit of Elysium accolade.|$|E

2500|$|Kai Harada's article Opera's Dirty <b>Little</b> <b>Secret</b> {{states that}} opera houses have begun using {{electronic}} acoustic enhancement systems [...] "...to compensate for flaws in a venue's acoustical architecture."

[...] Instead, most opera houses use the sound reinforcement system for acoustic enhancement, and for subtle boosting of offstage voices, onstage dialogue, and sound effects (e.g., church bells in Tosca or thunder in Wagnerian operas).|$|E

2500|$|Lords of Acid is a Belgian and American post-industrial/techno band, led by {{musician}} Praga Khan. They debuted {{with the}} new beat single [...] "I Sit on Acid" [...] in 1988. Created by Jade 4U, Praga Khan and Olivier Adams; their debut album, 1991's Lust (along with additional singles [...] "Rough Sex" [...] and [...] "I Must Increase My Bust"), were critically acclaimed within the electronic music and dance music communities for their outrageously sexual lyrics and sound samples. Their second album was Voodoo-U (1994), which featured a more industrial sound. This was followed by Our <b>Little</b> <b>Secret</b> (1997), Heaven Is an Orgasm (1998) and Expand Your Head (1999). In 2000 they released a more rock-influenced album titled Farstucker and in 2003, after being in the business for fifteen years, released a greatest hits album called Greatest T*ts.|$|E
2500|$|In early 2005, Angelides {{announced}} {{his intention to}} run against the current Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2006, having made <b>little</b> <b>secret</b> of his ambition for the Governor's Office {{from the time that}} Schwarzenegger was elected in 2003. On April 29, 2006, Angelides was endorsed by the California Democratic Party at the California State Democratic Convention in Sacramento. Despite this, polls from around that time showed that his opponent in the race, California State Controller Steve Westly, had an advantage in the primary. [...] Angelides then won the endorsements of the Sacramento Bee and the Los Angeles Times, two of California's largest newspapers, and the California League of Conservation Voters, after a head-to-head debate with Westly. [...] He also received the endorsement of the liberal San Francisco Bay Guardian. [...] A Field Poll held on June 2, 2006, had Westly leading Angelides by one percentage point, 35% to 34% with 26% undecided.|$|E

[...] He appeared drunk at a Patrolmen's Benevolent Association convention in 1984; under his watch in 1985, officers in Queens used stun guns on suspects and in 1986 officers in Brooklyn stole and sold drugs. [...] He was lambasted in 1987 for telling African American journalists that most crime in New York City was committed by young black men and later told black ministers in reference to that remark, [...] "our <b>little</b> <b>secret</b> is out." [...] He told a woman who was scared about a series of rapes that she was the type of woman a rapist would go after.|$|E

2500|$|Nothing {{is known}} about Tejada {{political}} activity during the Civil War and soon afterwards; though seconded to a Falangist unit, he is not mentioned as engaged in Carlist, Falangist or other party structures until the early 1940s. However, his writings published in 1938-1939 clearly identified him as enthusiast of national syndicalism and the caudillaje system; some consider him concerned primarily with justifying the regime. He admitted great juvenile admiration for Hitler. It was the second stay in Germany in 1940 that got him disillusioned with omnipotent state and single party; his 1940 article discussing caudillaje was notably tuned down and introduced a cautious tone. In the early 1940s he was assuming an increasingly dissenting stance. In 1942 he referred to [...] "misería" [...] of the Francoist system; the same year he was briefly detained for opposing subscriptions to División Azul. Though he had no chance to publish writings lambasting the system as anti-Catholic tyranny, Tejada made <b>little</b> <b>secret</b> of his views and in the Salamanca law faculty he voted against granting Franco doctorado honoris causa. In 1944 a Falangist hit-squad stormed into his house, dragged him to the nearby Retiro park and left him beaten unconscious.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2014, {{during a}} Q session for the album, at SONOS Studios in Los Angeles, California, Schoolboy Q {{described}} the song [...] "Prescription/Oxymoron", {{as the most}} personal: [...] "I came up selling OxyContin," [...] he said. [...] "The karma behind it was that I never took an OxyContin before but I did get addicted to Percocets, Xanax, Codeine—shit like that. When my daughter was one and two , I used to get into sleep comas, like 'Xan comas'—just dead {{to the world and}} I put it into the music." [...] Schoolboy Q said he arranged the song to juxtapose the process of selling prescription pills and addiction: [...] "I put the OxyContin and selling it {{at the end of the}} relapse or the addiction," [...] he said. [...] "I sold OxyContin and then I got addicted [...] This way, I showed that I got addicted then I sold it. That was a crazy record. That's true shit—the first part of it when my daughter tried to wake me up and I was dead to the world. That was my <b>little</b> <b>secret.</b> I always had the cup with me. They just never knew I had a gang of pills in the other bottle. That was a little story about me and how I was addicted, too." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1996, the Somalia inquiry had {{discovered}} evidence of a widespread cover-up {{of the murder of}} a Somali by the Airborne Regiment in 1993. Through the events that the inquiry was examining took place in {{the last days of the}} Mulroney government, many of the civil servants and officers involved were still serving in 1996. At time of the killing of the Somali teenager Shidane Arone in March 1993 the long-serving Deputy Defence minister Robert Fowler issued a memo saying that nothing must come to light that would embarrass the Defence Minister Kim Campbell. Fowler went on to serve as a senior diplomat under Chrétien. Chrétien made <b>little</b> <b>secret</b> of his annoyance with the Somalia inquiry, stating that inquiry was treating civil servants [...] "as if they were almost criminals" [...] and that the inquiry was taking too long as [...] "Even the Watergate was settled in six or seven weeks in the United States" [...] (the Watergate inquiry actually took 20 weeks). Later in 1996, Chrétien delivered a speech before a group of high school students, where he claimed to have regularly met with a homeless man in an Ottawa park to seek his advice, which he often took. At that point, journalists sought to find Chrétien's homeless advisor in the park, and could find no trace of any such person existing, which led Chrétien to admit that he not met with anybody homeless since becoming Prime Minister in 1993.|$|E
