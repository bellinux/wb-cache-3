50|$|Dual Arpeggio - As {{its name}} suggests, this player is a polyphonic, {{parallel}} arpeggiator that generates two rhythmic note patterns, (or arpeggios), from notes and chords played via MIDI input and can play them simultaneously. The patterns can be edited via a graphic display {{to play up}} to 4 separate notes per step, up to 16 steps. Additional controls include <b>setting</b> <b>keyboard</b> velocity and gate length information for each note, <b>setting</b> <b>keyboard</b> splits and more.|$|R

50|$|Mandatory for all {{railroad}} watches after roughly 1908, {{this kind}} of pocket watch was set by opening the crystal and bezel and pulling out the setting-lever (most hunter-cases have levers accessible without removing the crystal or bezel), which was generally found at either the 10 or 2 o'clock positions on open-faced watches, and at 5:00 on hunting cased watches. Once the lever was pulled out, the crown could be turned to set the time. The lever was then pushed back in and the crystal and bezel were closed over the dial again. This method of time setting on pocket watches was preferred by American and Canadian railroads, as <b>lever</b> <b>setting</b> watches make accidental time changes impossible. After 1908, <b>lever</b> <b>setting</b> was generally required for new watches entering service on American railroads.|$|R
50|$|Engine {{fuel supply}} through the {{injection}} pump {{was controlled by}} a governor. Rather than the usual arrangement where a control input from the driver's <b>lever</b> <b>sets</b> an engine speed that is maintained by a governor, in the Hi-Dyne engine the control input selected an output power level, which was maintained by the governor.|$|R

5000|$|However, AMC's most {{enduring}} styling feature debuted on the Ambassador for 1968, as flush-mounted paddle-style door handles replaced the former push-button units on all American Motors cars, save the Rambler American. The practical and [...] "disarmingly simple design" [...] predated safety-related mandates and industry norms. The interior locking {{was no longer}} by the traditional windowsill pushbutton, but a <b>lever</b> <b>set</b> into the armrest.|$|R

25|$|The {{majority}} of 1857 model Waltham movements are keywind {{from the rear}} and keyset from the front. A small amount of the total production of 1857 model movements were fitted with a stemwind mechanism from the factory. The earliest stemwind 1857 movements were fitted with no reversing clutch on the winding stem, and had no setting mechanism; these early movements required using a key to set the time. Later stemwind movements were <b>lever</b> <b>setting,</b> with a unique design of <b>set</b> <b>lever</b> which pivoted out from the movement rather than pulling out. Later 1857 movements also added a reversing clutch, a feature ubiquitous on all subsequent Waltham stemwind watches. All stemwind 1857 movements have the winding stem located at 3:00.|$|R

5000|$|As manual-wound {{mechanical}} watches {{became less}} popular and less favored in the 1970s, watch design and industrialists {{came out with}} the automatic watch. Whereas a mechanically-wound watch must be wound with the pendant or a <b>levered</b> <b>setting,</b> an automatic watch {{does not need to be}} wound by the pendant; simply rotating the watch winds the watch automatically. The interior of an automatic watch houses a swiveling metal or brass [...] "plate" [...] that swivels on its axis when the watch is shaken horizontally.|$|R
50|$|The sampler, {{although}} powerful, has a {{very complex}} access-and-editing route and lacks the ability to <b>set</b> <b>keyboard</b> ranges for different samples, {{making it difficult to}} create realistic sounds from a set of multisamples. There is, however a work-around for this via an external editor on the PC & Mac called: MC-909 Editor Update v3.1, that is freely available for download at this site.|$|R
50|$|In 1907, Walter A. Sheaffer {{patented}} the Lever filler, using a hinged <b>lever</b> <b>set</b> {{into the}} pen barrel which pressed down onto a bar {{which in turn}} compressed the rubber sac inside, creating a vacuum to force ink into the pen. Introduced in 1912, this innovation was rapidly imitated by the other major pen makers. Parker introduced the button filler, which had a button hidden beneath a blind cap {{on the end of}} the barrel; when pressed, it acted on a pressure bar inside to depress the ink sac.|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} the co-rays to a ray in a {{complete}} non-compact Finsler manifold contain geodesic segments to upper level sets of Busemann functions. Moreover, we characterise the co-point set to a ray as the cut locus of such level sets. The structure theorem of the co-point set on a surface, namely that is a local tree, and other properties follow immediately from the known results about the cut locus. We point out {{that some of our}} findings, in special the relation of co-point set to the upper <b>lever</b> <b>sets,</b> are new even for Riemannian manifolds...|$|R

In the case of Krakatau and SambaSunda, the bands from West Java, the traditional Sundanese kacapi suling and gamelan degung Sunda orchestra is performed alongside drum <b>set,</b> <b>keyboard</b> and guitars. Other bands such as Bossanova Java fused Javanese music with bossa nova, while the Kulkul band fuse jazz with Balinese gamelan.|$|R

50|$|The {{retractable}} undercarriage of the Oxford was internally designed, featuring broken-braced twin oleo legs that retract rearward into each engine nacelle. Although actuation of the retraction mechanism is normally achieved via an engine-driven pump, a manual fall-back mechanism is provided {{to force the}} wheels down {{in the event of}} an in-flight engine failure. The undercarriage wheels are equipped with pneumatically-operated brakes, which were controlled by a <b>lever</b> <b>set</b> on each control column. For inspection purposes, access panels are located beneath the pilot's cockpit for internal access to the flight controls, hydraulics and electrical components; inspection panels are also present in the outer wing sections.|$|R

50|$|In {{the mid to}} late 1950s each {{batch of}} soap, about 12 a day, was tested to ensure the absence of excess alkali or free fatty acid.

A major fire on the site completely destroyed the original factory.|$|R
25|$|The Model 1910 fires from {{a locked}} breech. When fired, the barrel and bolt recoil together. The barrel will stop in a {{rearward}} position. The bolt, unlocking itself, will then continue forward, stripping the chamber and driving the barrel forward again. After this action, a wedge will {{rise from the}} frame and lock the entire frame back into position. This firing system wasn't strong and had to fire cartridges weaker than the comparable 9×19 Parabellum caliber. The screw {{at the front of}} the frame, when undone will allow the removal of a plate on the left side of the pistol granting access to the moving parts within the pistol. This design was not stiff enough to sufficiently support the left side of the barrel extension and after prolonged firing, the left plate was prone to loosening. The only safety on the pistol was a small <b>lever</b> <b>set</b> in front of the grip.|$|R
50|$|Early cars {{such as the}} Ford Model T had a {{hand lever}} to control the {{throttle}}. Later cars used both a foot pedal and a hand <b>lever</b> to <b>set</b> the minimum throttle. This was an early form of cruise control. The 1918 Stutz Bearcat had a central throttle pedal with the clutch and brake {{to the right and}} left. Modern cruise control was invented in 1948.|$|R

The game's slot machine consisted of three modified slide projectors which used six-slotted metal discs similar to the wheels used in ViewMaster toys. The discs were spun by electric motors, and unused categories {{were removed from the}} board by shutting off the projectors for those windows.|$|R
