5|$|Kuntz {{was born}} on February 4, 1955 in Orange, California. He was born to Chet and Willie Kuntz. His father was a {{bricklayer}} who later became an auto mechanic. The family moved from Orange to Wichita, Kansas when Rusty was young, then moved to Paso Robles, California a few years later. He attended Paso Robles High School in California, where he played baseball, basketball, and football. He said that baseball was his <b>least</b> <b>favorite</b> of the three sports {{at the time and}} that he was drawn to basketball because of the game's pace.|$|E
25|$|His next film, Skyjacked (1972) was a hit. However The Call of the Wild (1972) was a flop, one of Heston's <b>least</b> <b>favorite</b> films. He quickly {{recovered}} with {{a string}} of hits: Soylent Green (1973), another science fiction story; The Three Musketeers (1973), playing Cardinal Richelieu in an all-star cast; Earthquake (1974), a disaster film; Airport 1975 (1975), another disaster film; Midway (1976) a war film.|$|E
25|$|This song makes {{reference}} to the Mayan civilization and Maya mythology, taking place circa the 8th century. According to Arjen Lucassen, it speaks especially about the Jaguar Temple {{and the city of}} Tikal. Certain samples used on the song come from an authentic Maya festival. Vocals on this song were provided by Jacqueline Govaert of Krezip. Arjen Lucassen has stated that this is his <b>least</b> <b>favorite</b> Ayreon song.|$|E

25|$|All I ask {{of you is}} one thing... I {{ask this}} {{particularly}} {{of the young people}} who watch. Please don't be cynical. I hate cynicism. For the record, it's my <b>least</b> <b>favorite</b> quality and it doesn't lead anywhere. Nobody in life gets exactly what they {{thought they were going to}} get. But if you work really hard and you're kind, amazing things will happen. I'm telling you, amazing things will happen.|$|E
25|$|Asada did {{not include}} salchow jumps in her junior and senior career {{programs}} until 2008. She had stated previously that the triple salchow was the first triple jump she had ever landed and {{that she did not}} have a problem landing it cleanly, but she was not comfortable using the jump in competition because it is one of her <b>least</b> <b>favorite</b> jumps. Asada added the 3S to her free skating at the 2008 NHK Trophy and 2008–09 Grand Prix Final.|$|E
25|$|During the film's production, Argento became {{stricken}} {{with a severe}} case of hepatitis---and had to direct some sequences while lying on his back. At one point, the illness became so painful that he was bedridden for a few days; filming was then restricted to second unit work, some of which was done by Mario Bava. Argento has called Inferno one of his <b>least</b> <b>favorite</b> of all his films...as his memories of the movie are tainted by his recollection of the painful illness he suffered.|$|E

25|$|The 2009 mayoral {{election}} in Burlington, Vermont {{provides an example}} in which strategy theoretically could have worked but would have been unlikely in practice. In that election, most supporters of the candidate who came in second (a Republican who led in first choices) preferred the Condorcet winner, a Democrat, to the IRV winner, the Progressive Party nominee. If 371 (12.6%) out of the 2951 backers of the Republican candidate (those who also preferred the Democrat over the Progressive candidate for mayor) had insincerely raised the Democrat from their second choice to their first (not changing their rankings relative to their <b>least</b> <b>favorite</b> candidate, the IRV winner), the Democrat would then advance to the final round (instead of their favorite), defeated any opponent, and have won the IRV election. This {{is an example of}} potential voter regret in that these voters who sincerely ranked their favorite candidate as first, find out after the fact that they caused the election of their <b>least</b> <b>favorite</b> candidate, which can lead to the voting tactic of compromising. Yet because the Republican led in first choices and only narrowly lost the final instant runoff, his backers would have been highly unlikely to pursue such a strategy.|$|E
25|$|Carnival of Chaos {{would be}} the last album with Pete Lee on guitar, being {{replaced}} by Tim Harriss who had previously been in the band around 1986 and was featured as a guest guitarist on America Must Be Destroyed. For the recording of We Kill Everything between late 1998 and early 1999, Michael Bishop would temporarily rejoin the band as the bassist during the absence of Casey Orr. The record, largely influenced by punk rock, is the band's <b>least</b> <b>favorite</b> album and thus its songs are rarely played live.|$|E
25|$|Chibiusa's {{dream is}} to one day become a real lady, to have her own prince, and {{to be friends with}} {{everyone}} she knows. Meanwhile, she is a fairly ordinary little girl; she likes the colour pink and red, pudding, pancakes, and rabbits. Her favorite school subject is drawing, while her least favorites are language classes. Her <b>least</b> <b>favorite</b> food is listed in the manga as carrots, just like Usagi, but they both eat them in the anime. Chibiusa hates taking care of the house and is afraid of such things as thunder and lightning, ghosts, vampires, dentists, and needles. She also likes to collect things with rabbits on them, and belongs to the Gardening Committee at school. She is very short when she first appears, but grows slightly taller as she gets older.|$|E

Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "Grotesque" [...] a D, labeling it as [...] "ponderous, oblique, and featuring one of Mulder's always annoying, easy-way-out soliloquy summations".|$|E
500|$|... "Compulsion" [...] was {{the third}} story in the book, but {{the first to be}} drawn, and was Kurtzman's <b>least</b> <b>favorite,</b> as he thought he had yet to perfect the style he had {{developed}} for the book. [...] The story recycled ideas from a Kurtzman strip called [...] "Endings to End the Fast Draw" [...] that TV Guide had rejected in 1958.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{criticism from}} {{the authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, who said that [...] "Team Homer" [...] is one of their <b>least</b> <b>favorite</b> episodes. They thought the school uniform plot was [...] "a lot more satisfying than the bowling story".

500|$|In a December 2006 interview, Shearer added, [...] "Now, [...] {{refuse to}} talk about it. They realize {{it was a horrible}} mistake. They never mention it.

500|$|Jon Bonné of MSNBC used [...] "Homer's Enemy" [...] as {{an example}} of a bad episode of the eighth season and wrote [...] "even now , when {{subsequent}} episodes have debased Homer in new and innovative ways, the Grimes episode stands out as painful to watch."

500|$|Both Buzz Aldrin and James Taylor {{received}} {{praise for}} their guest performances. IGN ranked James Taylor {{as being the}} twenty-first best guest appearance in the show's history. The Phoenix.com published their own list of [...] "Top 20 guest stars" [...] and Taylor placed eighteenth. Among The Simpsons staff, the episode {{is a favorite of}} David Silverman. On the other hand, it also contains one of Matt Groening's <b>least</b> <b>favorite</b> jokes, when Homer's face changes into Popeye and Richard Nixon while exposed to G-force.|$|E

500|$|John Powell of Slam! Wrestling {{rated the}} event as average, citing that it [...] "wasn't the greatest...". Despite his overall rating, he praised several moments, {{including}} Orton hitting Orndorff with his cast, King Kong Bundy's win, and André the Giant throwing {{the money into}} the crowd. Powell, however, listed Mr. T wrestling as his <b>least</b> <b>favorite</b> moment of the pay-per-view. He claimed the main event match, in which Mr. T took part, was humorous despite its lack of technical wrestling.|$|E
500|$|Ian Jones and Steve Williams, writers for British review website Off the Telly, {{claimed that}} the episode [...] "ditched all pretence of a plot and went flat out for individual, {{unconnected}} sight gags and vignettes". The two noted that it was their <b>least</b> <b>favorite</b> debut episode for a season of The Simpsons. In a separate article in Off the Telly, Jones and Williams write that the episode [...] "...wasn't shown for reasons of taste and has never appeared on terrestrial television in Britain", referring to a BBC Two schedule of the ninth season, which began in October 2001.|$|E
500|$|Both the Xindi landing pod and {{the alien}} {{spaceship}} {{were designed by}} John Eaves. He also produced a series of designs for a Vulcan shuttle which ended up being written out of the episode. The Xindi pod went through three designs being approved, while the alien spaceship was accepted on the first submission. However Eaves regretted this, as he had submitted a spaceship design which he strongly disliked, calling it [...] "by far my <b>least</b> <b>favorite</b> of anything I have ever drawn". It {{was based on a}} hatchet housed in a tool pouch. Eaves also developed the concept artwork for the alien temple.|$|E
