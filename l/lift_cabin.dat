40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf 32). This report discusses {{a detailed}} study of the Service Lift {{which can be used}} in the construction machinery field. One can say this lift is a mobile service lift, as it is easily assembled and transported to remote areas. This lift can be erected by bolt joint and its height can be easily increased for the required application. A solid model of the lift is created by using Solid Works 2008. Modeling starts from creating pait drawings, sub assemblies and ends at modeling of the complete machine. First, the lift foundation model was created as it holds the vertical column assembly. Then the position of the vertical column assembly is selected according to the available space on the lift foundation. Once the vertical column position is fixed, then the truss foundation assembly is created to clamp the vertical column firmly. Finally, the <b>lift</b> <b>cabin</b> is attached to the vertical column by using a rack and pinion gear train. After assembly of the complete model one can easily observe the validity of assumptions, as design brainstorming staiis from here.

40|$|Vertical {{transportation}} systems take up, especially in high-rise buildings, {{a lot of}} valuable floor space. The master project analyses different scenarios for reducing the floor space {{taken up by the}} vertical transportation system, by introducing another principle in vertical transportation: the loop transport principle. Conventional lifts are optimised, due to technical progress, and a smarter control of <b>lift</b> <b>cabins,</b> but cabins still move {{up and down in the}} same shaft. If it would be physically possible for cabins to move independently and behind each other, the number of cabins in two shafts could be higher than two (fig. 1). A model of the basic loop transport principle, developed in the master project, illustrates that a building using the loop transport principle can have significantly more floors compared to a building using a conventional lift, about twice as many. Starting point for this comparison is that both buildings uses the same floor space per floor for vertical transportation (two shafts) and the vertical transportation system provides satisfactory travel and waiting times. Techniques which can be used for the physical movement of cabins for the loop transport principle are described in patents. The developed model describes the basic loop transport principle; the functioning of the basic loop transport principle can therefore be quantified. Opportunities to improve the loop transport principle are based on two aspects: the control of the <b>lift</b> <b>cabins</b> and the way cabins move through the building. Important to know is that these two aspects are interdependent. Within the basic loop transport principle, cabins move entirely to the top or to the bottom to change their vertical direction. There are other variants of the loop transport principle where this is not necessary. Variants for the basic loop transport principle and suggested in the master project are; 3 - 1 loop transport principle (fig. 2), cabin out loop (fig. 3) and the loop in loop (fig. 4). A well functioning loop transport principle results in a system which acts more as a taxi whereas a conventional lift acts as a bus. Conventional lifts fill up and after that they will stop several times to deliver passengers. The loop transport principle has a more individual functioning, so smaller cabins can be used to achieve the same or better transport capacity.

Gli interventi previsti, all'interno della fattibilità per l'impianto ettometrico di risalita, si sono intrecciati, sin dalle fasi iniziali di studio, con il progetto di riqualificazione dei percorsi turistici nel Borgo di Verrès. The article {{describes}} the access project of the Verrès castle, located in Aosta Valley in Italy, underlining some urban and transport planning and design elements. This project constitute in fact an interesting example of integration between transport infrastructure planning and design with urban planning strategy for tourism development. The transport infrastructure (in this case a vertical lift for tourism use) has furthermore a deep attention to the landscape and social contest and a good architectural design. The Verrès castle access project represents and interesting example of sustainable mobility and of touristic area accessibility which is strong integrated with urban renewal and territorial development. The feasibility study, financed by the Verrès municipality, {{is part of a}} the INTERREG IIIA ACOLTRA Project financed by Italy and France with the aim of creating a network of transnational tourist itineraries. Through this initiative Aosta Valley and Haute-Savoy are developing a common tourism strategy that intends to promote cultural heritage and tourism mobility through the RITT (Reseaux d’Itineraires Touristiques Transfrontalieres). In this contest of intervention the study for the accessibility of the Verrès castle is inserted, with the aim of designing a mobility infrastructure for the main attraction of the valley and at the same of strengthening the appeal of tourist attraction of the whole area. The project is located in the small city of Verrés, that lies at 390 m, {{on the banks of the}} river Evançon. As many of the Valdostani municipalities is characterized by several small urban centers, which are located in a around 8 kmq, in a territory where live 2. 700 inhabitants. The feasibility study examines three different alternative for a lift that should connect the Verrès centre with the castle. In particular different transport technology (inclined and vertical lift) and several path alternatives have been evaluated. The final solution is constituted by a vertical lift and an horizontal corridor thought the mountain. This alternative in fact minimize the environmental and landscape impacts. The main entrance to the access structure in located in the valley near the Evançon torrent banks: the entrance space has been designed as an covered and inviting atrium. The gallery path is 80 m long and is interrupted by a central hall that divides the long corridor into two segments. In the central hall a tourist information point and Verrès Castle history exhibition are located. After the second corridor segment the lift waiting room is positioned. The vertical lift has a 15 person capacity and a journey time of 1 minute and 30 seconds.

50|$|Because of the {{proliferation}} of such systems in the Alpine regions of Europe, the French and German names, téléphérique and Seilbahn, respectively, are often also used in an English language context. Cable car is the usual term in British English, as in British English the word tramway generally refers to a railed street tramway while in American English, cable car may additionally refer to a cable-pulled street tramway with detachable vehicles; e.g., San Francisco's cable cars. As such, careful phrasing is necessary to prevent confusion. It is also sometimes called a ropeway or even incorrectly {{referred to as a}} gondola lift. A gondola <b>lift</b> has <b>cabins</b> suspended from a continuously circulating cable whereas aerial trams simply shuttle back and forth on cables.

5000|$|Around {{the same}} time, {{neighboring}} communities {{began to make}} accusations that the Osage community {{was responsible for the}} disappearances, and a meeting was arranged by the Osage township in the Harmony Grove schoolhouse. The meeting was attended by seventy-five locals, including Colonel York and both Pa and John Bender. After discussing the disappearances, including that of William York, it was agreed that a search warrant would be obtained to search every homestead between Big Hill Creek and Drum Creek. Despite York's strong suspicions regarding the Benders since his visit several weeks earlier, no one had watched them, and it was not noticed for several days that they had fled.Three days after the township meeting, Billy Tole was driving cattle past the Bender property when he noticed that the inn was abandoned and the farm animals were unfed. Tole reported the fact to the township trustee, but because of inclement weather, several days lapsed before the abandonment could be investigated. The township trustee called for volunteers, and several hundred turned out to form a search party that included Colonel York. When the party arrived at the inn they found the cabin empty of food, clothing, and personal possessions. A bad odor was noticed and traced to a trap door underneath a bed, nailed shut. After opening the trap, the empty room beneath, 6 ft deep and 7 ft square at the top by 3 ft square at the bottom, was found to have clotted blood on the floor. The stone slab floor was broken up with sledgehammers but no bodies were found, and it was determined that the smell was from blood that had soaked into the soil. The men then physically <b>lifted</b> the <b>cabin</b> and moved it to the side so they could dig under it, but no bodies were found. They then began to probe the ground around the cabin with a metal rod, especially in the disturbed soil of the vegetable garden and orchard, where Dr. York's body was found later that evening, buried face down with his feet barely below the surface. The probing continued until midnight, with another nine suspected grave sites marked before the men were satisfied they had found them all and retired for the night. Digging resumed the following morning; another eight bodies were found in seven of the nine suspected graves, while one was found in the well, along with a number of body parts. All but one had had their heads bashed with a hammer and their throats cut, and it was reported in newspapers that all had been [...] "indecently mutilated". The body of a young girl was found with no injuries sufficient to cause death; it was speculated that she had been strangled or buried alive.|$|R
40|$|Broadly speaking, 2 ̆ 2 {{space tourism}} 2 ̆ 2 denotes any {{commercial}} activity that offers customers {{direct or indirect}} experience with space travel. 1 Such activities have many different designs, ranging from long-term stays in orbital facilities to short-term orbital or suborbital flights, and even parabolic flights in an aircraft exposing passengers to short periods of weightlessness. 2 Flights into outer space by private individuals are finding increased attention in the public. While there are not yet chartered flights, occasional orbital flights with 2 ̆ 2 space tourists 2 ̆ 2 have taken place. So far, five 2 ̆ 2 space tourists 2 ̆ 2 {{have been taken to}} the International Space Station (2 ̆ 2 ISS 2 ̆ 2), all of whom were charged large sums of money for the experience. The fifth 2 ̆ 2 tourist, 2 ̆ 2 Charles Simonyi, recently flew to the ISS in April 2007. 3 However, interest seems to be shifting to providing 2 ̆ 2 cheaper flights 2 ̆ 2 which are not aimed at the ISS but remain 2 ̆ 2 suborbital 2 ̆ 2 so that they are affordable for a somewhat broader public. Yet, even with such short-term flights, a space tourist has different options. One option, modelled after SpaceShipOne, 4 uses an aircraft to <b>lift</b> a space <b>cabin</b> to a certain altitude. The cabin then separates from the aircraft and continues its suborbital flight to higher altitudes. There are two possibilities for return when this method is used: (a) the space vehicle returns to where it started from, or (b) it returns to a different location on Earth (2 ̆ 2 space transportation 2 ̆ 2). A second option, which is modelled on the 2 ̆ 2 Delta Clipper Experimental, 2 ̆ 2 5 uses a rocket with a space capsule on top which is launched, and then the capsule separates from the rocket at a certain altitude. As a result, the passengers of the space capsule are exposed to Zero-G gravity and both vehicles return to Earth independent from each other. It is expected that Blue Origin 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 New Shepard 2 ̆ 2 will use this method. 6 2 ̆ 2 Space tourism 2 ̆ 2 activities may thus include the use of an aircraft and/or spacecraft. Depending on where such activities actually take place, either air law or space law, or even both, may apply. The two legal regimes have historically evolved independently from each other and accordingly show some major differences. A variety of legal issues regarding the conduct of space tourism activities arise as a result. This Article focuses on some of the most problematic issues of relevance such as the delimitation of airspace and outer space, authorization to conduct space tourism, registration of the aircraft or spacecraft, liability to passengers and third parties, and the status of passengers.

In this respect, {{it is interesting to note}} that on January 26, 2007, the Swedish government announced an agreement with Virgin Galactic concerning mid-summer and mid-winter flights of Virgin 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 SpaceShipTwo 2 ̆ 2 from Sweden 2 ̆ 7 s spaceport in Kiruna. 7 Their Memorandum of Understanding calls for Swedish authorities to prepare a regulatory regime modelled on that of the U.
