5|$|Because banded sea kraits {{spend much}} of their time on <b>land,</b> <b>they</b> are often {{encountered}} by humans. They are frequently found in the water intake and exhaust pipes of boats. Banded sea kraits are also attracted to light and can be distracted by artificial sources of light, including hotels and other buildings, on coasts.|$|E
5|$|Divers are aquatic birds {{the size}} of a large duck, to which they are unrelated. They swim well and fly {{adequately}} but, because their legs are placed towards the rear of the body, are clumsy on <b>land.</b> <b>They</b> feed on fish and other aquatic animals.|$|E
50|$|The Vikings were to {{the distant}} posts, traders and mercenaries but to the {{adjacent}} <b>lands</b> <b>they</b> were conquerors. Importing ‘more their semen than their culture’, they {{became part of the}} <b>lands</b> <b>they</b> put under their control.|$|R

5|$|In October 1879, after {{forming the}} Land League of Mayo, Davitt formed the Irish National Land League. The Land League's aims were to reduce rents {{and to stop}} evictions, {{and in the long}} term, to make tenant farmers owners of the <b>land</b> <b>they</b> farmed. Davitt asked Parnell to become the leader of the league. In 1880, Parnell was also elected leader of the Home Rule Party.|$|E
5|$|On St. Laurence's Day in 1500, Portuguese {{explorer}} Diogo Dias {{landed on}} the island and named it São Lourenço. Polo's name was preferred and popularized on Renaissance maps. No single Malagasy-language name predating Madagasikara appears to have been used by the local population to refer to the island, although some communities had their own name for part or all of the <b>land</b> <b>they</b> inhabited.|$|E
5|$|Once Egypt {{became a}} Roman province, Roman {{officials}} sought to limit temples' power and independence. Temples {{were made to}} either pay rent to {{the government for the}} <b>land</b> <b>they</b> owned or surrender that land to the state in exchange for a government stipend. Their cults became tightly regulated, less self-supporting, and dependent on government donations and various small sources of revenue.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} amphibians {{evolved in}} the Devonian period from sarcopterygian fish with lungs and bony-limbed fins, features that were helpful in adapting to dry <b>land.</b> <b>They</b> diversified and became dominant during the Carboniferous and Permian periods, but were later displaced by reptiles and other vertebrates. Over time, amphibians shrank in size and decreased in diversity, leaving only the modern subclass Lissamphibia.|$|E
5|$|The {{positioning}} of the egret's eyes allows for binocular vision during feeding, and physiological {{studies suggest that the}} species may be capable of crepuscular or nocturnal activity. Adapted to foraging on <b>land,</b> <b>they</b> have lost the ability possessed by their wetland relatives to accurately correct for light refraction by water.|$|E
5|$|The ten {{reserves}} {{existing in}} 2012 had a combined area of 6,016ha (14,863acres), 78percent of the SSSI. Although {{they have no}} legal protection beyond that of privately owned <b>land,</b> <b>they</b> may have more active management or provide visitor facilities. The mixed ownership reflects land becoming available for purchase or management at various times, and the differing priorities of the conservation bodies.|$|E

5|$|Aided by Whitman—who {{has managed}} to {{negotiate}} some degree of freedom with the Solarii—Lara returns to the palace to rescue Sam as Roth commandeers a helicopter to get them out. Lara succeeds, but persuades Sam to escape by land when she sees another storm gathering as the helicopter approaches. As Lara tries to force the helicopter pilot to <b>land,</b> <b>they</b> are brought down, with Lara nearly dying. Roth revives Lara, then takes a fatal blow from Mathias meant for her.|$|E
5|$|Andrew II {{decided to}} return home, leaving the crusaders' camp with Hugh I and Bohemond IV in early 1218. Although {{military}} action was suspended after their departure, the crusaders restored fortifications at Caesarea and Atlit. After new troops arrived from the Holy Roman Empire in April, they decided to invade Egypt. They elected John supreme commander, giving him the right to rule the <b>land</b> <b>they</b> would conquer. His leadership was primarily nominal, since he could rarely impose his authority on an army of troops from many countries.|$|E
5|$|At first Nansen and Johansen {{made good}} {{progress}} south, but on 13 April suffered a serious setback when {{both of their}} chronometers stopped. Without knowing the correct time, {{it was impossible for}} them to calculate their longitude and thus navigate their way accurately to Franz Josef <b>Land.</b> <b>They</b> restarted the watches on the basis of Nansen's guess that they were at longitude 86°E, but from then on were uncertain of their true position.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the First Crusade, Crusader armies assembled at Constantinople and promised to return to the Byzantine Empire any <b>land</b> <b>they</b> might conquer. However, Bohemond, the son of Alexios' former enemy Robert Guiscard, claimed the Principality of Antioch for himself. Alexios did not recognize the legitimacy of the Principality, and Bohemond went to Europe looking for reinforcements. He launched into open warfare against Alexios, but he was soon forced to surrender and negotiate with Alexios at the imperial camp at Diabolis (Devol), where the Treaty was signed.|$|E
5|$|Both {{in water}} and on land, the newts are largely nocturnal. In their aquatic habitats, they hide under vegetation, and on <b>land,</b> <b>they</b> use {{structures}} such as logs, rocks, or small animal burrows for cover. They feed mainly on different invertebrates, but in the water may also prey on tadpoles and smaller newts. Predators include herons and other birds, snakes such as the grass snake, and various carnivorous mammals.|$|E
5|$|Cosimo became perturbed by the {{question}} of the Tuscan Succession following the death of his mother. Ferdinando was lacking any children, as was Anna Maria Luisa. The latter, who was high in her father's estimation, put forward a German princess to marry Gian Gastone. The lady in question, Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg, nominal heiress of the Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg, was extremely wealthy. Cosimo once again dreamed of a Medici cadet branch in a foreign <b>land.</b> <b>They</b> were married on 2 July 1697. Gian Gastone and herself did not get along; he eventually abandoned her in 1708.|$|E

In the mid-lands; corn, beans, yuca, arracacha, malanga, coca, cotton, pineapple, papaya, guava, passion fruit, sweet granadilla, oranges and limes. Coffee is cultivated {{for commercial purposes}} only along with Arhuaca mochilas (handmade bags, fashionable among {{both males and females}} in Bogota and other major Colombian cities), and other arts and crafts to exchange in the lower <b>lands</b> for products <b>they</b> don't get in the high <b>lands.</b> <b>They</b> also raise chickens, cattle, sheep and goats. Men produce entirely the traditional clothing, but nowadays they also use modern clothing.|$|R

5|$|During Pryer's {{tenure of}} being the first {{resident}} of Sandakan, one of his first tasks was to establish law and order. But since the local natives, although cowed by the guns of the British Navy, considered the British as transgressors in their <b>land,</b> <b>they</b> were hostile towards the authority of the British North Borneo Company. Hence, Pryer had to import his police from India and Singapore. His first contingent of police was made up of Indian Sikhs with a large body stature. The Indian police were probably from the Sepoy Company in India and were generally called 'Sipai' by the locals.|$|E
5|$|In 1825 the {{inhabitants}} of Rùm (then numbering some 450 people) were given a year's notice to quit. The inhabitants of Rùm had simply been tenant farmers, paying rent to the laird; they owned neither the <b>land</b> <b>they</b> worked, nor the houses in which they lived. On 11 July 1826, about 300 of {{the inhabitants}} boarded two overcrowded ships bound for Cape Breton in Nova Scotia. The laird, and Dr Lachlan, paid for their journey. The remaining population followed in 1827. Similar evictions happened all over the gaelic-speaking parts of Scotland, and collectively {{became known as the}} Highland Clearances.|$|E
5|$|In May 1944, a Junkers Ju 188 {{was shot}} down by a Mosquito nearby and its debris was {{scattered}} across the village, including the church wall. Later, the inhabitants had to be evacuated when a bomb fell into the field opposite Manor Farm, {{and had to be}} defused and removed by the Royal Engineers. In 1962, the Dutton Estate holdings were sold to seven tenant farmers who retained the <b>land</b> <b>they</b> farmed but sold the remaining woodlands and properties.|$|E
