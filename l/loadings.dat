5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, {{the success of}} deep-bore {{electric}} trains on the Underground suggested that local services out of London could also be electrified. Following the war, the GER needed more capacity out of Liverpool Street as it was at capacity (serving almost 230,000 passengers daily in 1921), {{but they could not}} afford electrification. They considered high powered and high tractive steam locomotives including the GER Class A55 as a possible alternative, but these were rejected because of high track <b>loadings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Richard Maunsell was {{appointed}} CME of the SECR in 1913, following {{the retirement of}} Harry Wainwright due to ill health. Wainwright left a legacy of competent but unspectacular locomotives that struggled {{to cope with the}} increased train lengths and <b>loadings.</b> Maunsell took control of the short-term situation by improving existing designs, and he introduced new engines to progressively replace obsolete classes. New designs could also cut costs on the SECR, as one capable mixed-traffic locomotive could undertake the work of two separate passenger or freight types. The first new design was to become Maunsell's Nclass 2-6-0.|$|E
5|$|The ceramic waste forms offer higher waste <b>loadings</b> {{than the}} glass options because {{ceramics}} have crystalline structure. Also, mineral analogues of the ceramic waste forms {{provide evidence for}} long term durability. Due to this fact {{and the fact that}} they can be processed at lower temperatures, ceramics are often considered the next generation in high level radioactive waste forms. Ceramic waste forms offer great potential, but a lot of research remains to be done.|$|E
5|$|Operational {{experience}} with the Nclass prototype demonstrated that it was capable of coping with peacetime passenger and freight traffic on the mainline between London and Ramsgate, but Maunsell anticipated an increase in traffic that would require a more powerful locomotive capable of hauling longer trains. The use of larger engines was prevented by low permitted axle <b>loadings</b> on parts of the SECR network, caused by economies in track construction by using flint beach pebbles as track ballast; this material failed to hold the track in place when under strain and could not support heavy locomotives. In the meantime Maunsell settled upon producing a 3-cylinder version of the Nclass 2-6-0, which provided the opportunity to test {{a variant of the}} Gresley conjugated valve gear developed by his assistant, Harold Holcroft.|$|E
5|$|Robert Urie {{completed}} his H15class mixed-traffic 4-6-0 design in 1913 and the prototype {{was built in}} August 1914. It showed a marked improvement in performance over Dugald Drummond’s LSWR T14 class 4-6-0 when tested on local and express passenger trains. The introduction of ten H15 engines into service coincided with {{the outbreak of the}} First World War, which prevented construction of further class members. Despite the interruption caused by the conflict, Urie anticipated that peacetime increases in passenger traffic would necessitate longer trains from London to the south-west of England. Passenger <b>loadings</b> on the heavy boat trains to the London and South Western Railway’s (LSWR) ports of Portsmouth, Weymouth and Southampton had been increasing prior to the war, and was beginning to overcome the capabilities of the LSWR’s passenger locomotive fleet. His response was to produce a modern, standard express passenger design similar to the H15.|$|E
5|$|Richard Maunsell was {{appointed}} CME of the SECR in 1913, following the enforced retirement of Harry Wainwright, {{who had left}} a range of competent but unspectacular locomotive classes that struggled {{to cope with the}} increased train lengths and <b>loadings.</b> Maunsell reviewed the situation and planned to introduce six standard classes – using only two boiler designs – which would work the entire traffic of the railway. The first of these was the Nclass 2-6-0, which gave the SECR a capable mixed-traffic locomotive. For the express passenger design that could cope with the heavy boat trains, Maunsell wanted to enlarge the existing Lclass 4-4-0 with Walschaerts valve gear and an enlarged superheater, but this design would have resulted in a too heavy axle loading. Maunsell's newly recruited assistants, G.H.Pearson and Harold Holcroft from the Great Western Railway at Swindon and James Clayton from the Midland Railway at Derby, had recently been involved in the design of large passenger tank engines and persuaded him to use the 2-6-4 wheel arrangement, which would allow the class to operate at high speeds on the poor-quality track in north Kent.|$|E
25|$|Good <b>loadings</b> on an {{experimental}} night service run from October 1925 to April 1926 saw the Corporation make {{plans to introduce}} regular winter night services.|$|E
25|$|Tamworth {{is served}} by thrice-weekly bus {{services}} to Coffs Harbour and Brisbane by New England Coaches. Greyhound Buslines stopped servicing Tamworth in 2016 citing unprofitable passenger <b>loadings.</b>|$|E
25|$|Electronically {{polarized}} N-tosyl imines {{are reduced}} with high enantioselectivity and yield by palladium(II) and ruthenium(II) catalyst systems, although catalyst <b>loadings</b> {{tend to be}} relatively high under both direct and transfer hydrogenative conditions.|$|E
25|$|Effluent {{from the}} {{pulp and paper}} {{industry}} is generally high in suspended solids and BOD. Plants that bleach wood pulp for paper making may generate chloroform, dioxins (including 2,3,7,8-TCDD), furans, phenols and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Stand-alone paper mills using imported pulp may only require simple primary treatment, such as sedimentation or dissolved air flotation. Increased BOD or COD <b>loadings,</b> as well as organic pollutants, may require biological treatment such as activated sludge or upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors. For mills with high inorganic <b>loadings</b> like salt, tertiary treatments may be required, either general membrane treatments like ultrafiltration or reverse osmosis or treatments to remove specific contaminants, such as nutrients.|$|E
25|$|In North America, heavy rail {{can also}} refer to rapid transit, when {{referring}} to systems with heavier passenger <b>loadings</b> than light rail systems, but distinct from commuter rail and intercity rail systems. It is characterized by high-speed, passenger rail cars running in separate rights-of-way from which all other vehicular and foot traffic are excluded.|$|E
25|$|The RM class entered {{service from}} 1959 to replace trolleybuses, which {{finished}} in May 1962. Subsequent Routemasters, the last 500 {{of which were}} RMLs, began replacing the previous generation of buses, the AEC Regent RT and Leyland Titan RTL and RTW. RMLs also displaced RMs on central routes to cope with higher <b>loadings.</b> The last Routemaster entered service in March 1968.|$|E
25|$|Increasing <b>loadings</b> and the ageing of the {{original}} locomotive fleet led to {{the purchase of a}} powerful six wheel side tank engine with the extraordinary tractive effort of 22,403lb. It became WCC no 16 and was delivered from Andrew Barclay in July 1934. Two similar engines, nos 17 and 18 followed in 1935 and 1938, and nos 19 and 20 followed in 1939.|$|E
25|$|Horse trams, {{a legacy}} of the old private tramway companies, were phased out as soon as they could be {{replaced}} by steam or electric traction. The steam trams continued in service for many decades, initially to continue services while installation of electrical infrastructure was still underway, but eventually relegated to non-revenue operations and providing additional capacity at times of heavy <b>loadings.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some routes {{included}} short workings, {{which were}} typically extra services run to intermediary termini {{to cope with}} high <b>loadings</b> at peak times. A wide-ranging review of the bus route network instigated in the late 1970s resulted in the termination of most of these short workings, the amalgamation of shorter routes into longer ones, and the re-timing of many services to make arrival times more realistic.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} {{recession in the}} 1970s meant {{that there was a}} considerable contraction of heavy industrial sectors, reducing pollution <b>loadings</b> from factories and foundries. Later improvements such as the series of purification lakes that were constructed on the Tame in the 1980s, which allowed contaminated sediment to settle out from the river, also reduced pollution levels, and lessened the impact of first flush runoff events in the lower Tame and the middle Trent.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} {{of the three}} methods here discussed, the mechanics of materials method is available for simple structural members subject to specific <b>loadings</b> such as axially loaded bars, prismatic beams {{in a state of}} pure bending, and circular shafts subject to torsion. The solutions can under certain conditions be superimposed using the superposition principle to analyze a member undergoing combined loading. Solutions for special cases exist for common structures such as thin-walled pressure vessels.|$|E
25|$|Two Leyland Cubs were {{purchased}} in 1984 {{for the price}} of one standard-sized bus to provide much needed additional capacity. They, like the Lion before them, were designed to accommodate both seated and standing passengers and were assembled by Modern Motor Bodies Limited. They were evaluated to find the most suitable duties for them, and were found to be most useful on routes where the operation of a full-sized bus was difficult or only light <b>loadings</b> were expected.|$|E
25|$|There are {{distinct}} differences between displacement and elution chromatography. In elution mode, substances typically {{emerge from a}} column in narrow, Gaussian peaks. Wide separation of peaks, preferably to baseline, is desired for maximum purification. The speed at which any component of a mixture travels down the column in elution mode depends on many factors. But for two substances to travel at different speeds, and thereby be resolved, there must be substantial differences in some interaction between the biomolecules and the chromatography matrix. Operating parameters are adjusted to maximize {{the effect of this}} difference. In many cases, baseline separation of the peaks can be achieved only with gradient elution and low column <b>loadings.</b> Thus, two drawbacks to elution mode chromatography, especially at the preparative scale, are operational complexity, due to gradient solvent pumping, and low throughput, due to low column <b>loadings.</b> Displacement chromatography has advantages over elution chromatography in that components are resolved into consecutive zones of pure substances rather than “peaks”. Because the process takes advantage of the nonlinearity of the isotherms, a larger column feed can be separated on a given column with the purified components recovered at significantly higher concentrations.|$|E
25|$|A small, light fighter, its {{low wing}} <b>loadings</b> were {{excellent}} for air combat maneuvering and its small size {{made it difficult}} to spot even when its adversary was warned of its presence. Typically, the MiG-21 was used in hit-and-run tactics; being vectored by Ground Control Intercept (GCI) to an intercept position to the vulnerable rear of an American strike formation, then executing a missile attack and diving away before fighter cover could intervene. Scoring its first kill on October 5, 1966, in December intercepting MiG-21s shot down two F-105s and forced 20% of all strike sorties to jettison their bombloads.|$|E
25|$|After the war, {{passenger}} numbers {{continued to}} rise strongly. In 1961, they surpassed the million mark for the first time, but took a short term hit in 1963, due to a typhoid epidemic in Zermatt. Also goods traffic increased, especially to serve the construction of power stations in the Saas Valley massive rises in demand in Zermatt. The VZ {{took advantage of the}} upturn to modernise rail operations gradually: between 1958 and 1989 all major bridges (apart from the Kipfenbrücke, which, after its destruction by an avalanche in 1947 was reerected as a steel bridge) were replaced by reinforced concrete structures, which enabled an increase in axle <b>loadings.</b>|$|E
25|$|The F-4 Phantom II {{had been}} in {{operational}} service with the United States Air Force since 1964. The latest fighter in American service, the F-4 had powerful engines, excellent handling, and an air-to-air configuration of eight air-to-air missiles. However, the Phantom suffered from one critical armament weakness – {{the lack of an}} internal cannon, as its original conception as a fleet defense interceptor dictated that air combat would occur at beyond visual range with radar-guided missiles. It was also a large, heavy fighter, with high wing <b>loadings</b> that degraded its performance in high-G turns, and with engines that tended to produce large amounts of smoke, making it highly visible in combat.|$|E
25|$|WorkChoices {{was not a}} 2004 Liberal party {{election}} policy. However, {{following the}} 2004 federal election, the Liberal-National coalition held a majority {{in both houses of}} parliament, and amendments were introduced into the House of Representatives on 2 November 2005. A senate inquiry was held into the Bill from 14 November 2005 to 22 November 2005. The length of this was criticised by the Opposition as being too short. A survey by the Workplace Authority found that although most AWAs (Australian Workplace Agreement) removed some leave <b>loadings,</b> this was also accompanied by a wage rise in most cases. WorkChoices was passed by the Senate on 2 December 2005. The primary changes came into effect on 27 March 2006.|$|E
25|$|The {{ships were}} used on an {{eastbound}} route from Bordeaux to Singapore (then in Japanese, thus Axis, hands) with cargoes of mercury, steel and aluminum bars, welding steel, bomb prototypes, 20 mm guns, blueprints for tanks and bombsights, {{and up to}} a dozen passengers. Return trip <b>loadings</b> were 110-155 tons of rubber, 44-70 tons of zinc, five tons of tungsten, two tons of quinine, two tons of opium, bamboo, rattan, and passengers. Comandante Cappellini, Reginaldo Giuliani, and Enrico Tazzoli departed Bordeaux in May 1943. The first two completed their voyages in July and August, but Enrico Tazzoli was destroyed by Allied bombers in the Bay of Biscay. Barbarigo was similarly destroyed during a June departure, but Luigi Torrelli reached Singapore in August.|$|E
25|$|None of {{the lines}} {{constructed}} ever made a profit. Freight rates were the same for broad and narrow-gauge railways, despite higher direct costs. Most of the <b>loadings</b> were goods such as timber, potatoes and lime, which were charged at a low rate. Most freight was outbound, so many trains travelled towards the terminals almost empty. And despite originating the traffic, the lines were only credited with {{a portion of the}} freight charge. The amount credited to the lines did not cover the cost of running trains, and the more traffic the larger the loss. However, particularly in the 1920s, the traffic generated by the narrow-gauge lines was appreciated by the railways and the lines survived for up to 60 years before closure.|$|E
25|$|Formal self-insurance is the {{deliberate}} decision {{to pay for}} otherwise insurable losses out of one's own money. This can be done on a formal basis by establishing a separate fund into which funds are deposited on a periodic basis, or by simply forgoing the purchase of available insurance and paying out-of-pocket. Self-insurance is usually {{used to pay for}} high-frequency, low-severity losses. Such losses, if covered by conventional insurance, mean having to pay a premium that includes <b>loadings</b> for the company's general expenses, cost of putting the policy on the books, acquisition expenses, premium taxes, and contingencies. While this is true for all insurance, for small, frequent losses the transaction costs may exceed the benefit of volatility reduction that insurance otherwise affords.|$|E
25|$|The flyby was {{the center}} of a four-month {{intensive}} observation campaign lasting from January to June. Being an ever-changing scientific target, Jupiter has been observed intermittently {{since the end of the}} Galileo mission in September 2003. Knowledge about Jupiter benefited from the fact that New Horizons instruments were built using the latest technology, especially in the area of cameras, representing a significant improvement over Galileo cameras, which were modified versions of Voyager cameras, which, in turn, were modified Mariner cameras. The Jupiter encounter also served as a shakedown and dress rehearsal for the Pluto encounter. Because Jupiter is much closer to Earth than Pluto, the communications link can transmit multiple <b>loadings</b> of the memory buffer; thus the mission returned more data from the Jovian system than it was expected to transmit from Pluto.|$|E
25|$|Good {{structural}} design {{is important in}} most building design, but particularly for skyscrapers since even a small chance of catastrophic failure is unacceptable given the high price. This presents a paradox to civil engineers: {{the only way to}} assure a lack of failure is to test for all modes of failure, in both the laboratory and the real world. But the only way to know of all modes of failure is to learn from previous failures. Thus, no engineer can be absolutely sure that a given structure will resist all <b>loadings</b> that could cause failure, but can only have large enough margins of safety such that a failure is acceptably unlikely. When buildings do fail, engineers question whether the failure was due to some lack of foresight or due to some unknowable factor.|$|E
25|$|At altitude, {{atmospheric}} pressure {{is lower than}} at sea level, so surfacing {{at the end of}} an altitude dive leads to a greater relative reduction in pressure and an increased risk of decompression sickness compared to the same dive profile at sea level. The dives are also typically carried out in freshwater at altitude so it has a lower density than seawater used for calculation of decompression tables. The amount of time the diver has spent acclimatising at altitude is also of concern as divers with gas <b>loadings</b> near those of sea level may also be at an increased risk. The US Navy recommends waiting 12 hours following arrival at altitude before performing the first dive. The tissue supersaturation following an ascent to altitude can also be accounted for by considering it to be residual nitrogen and allocating a residual nitrogen group when using tables with this facility.|$|E
25|$|Reinforcement is the {{synergistic}} {{improvement of}} a total system’s strength created {{by the introduction of}} a geotextile, geogrid or geocell (all of which are good in tension) into a soil (that is good in compression, but poor in tension) or other disjointed and separated material. Applications of this function are in mechanically stabilized and retained earth walls and steep soil slopes; they can be combined with masonry facings to create vertical retaining walls. Also involved is the application of basal reinforcement over soft soils and over deep foundations for embankments and heavy surface <b>loadings.</b> Stiff polymer geogrids and geocells {{do not have to be}} held in tension to provide soil reinforcement, unlike geotextiles. Stiff 2D geogrid and 3D geocells interlock with the aggregate particles and the reinforcement mechanism is one of confinement of the aggregate. The resulting mechanically stabilized aggregate layer exhibits improved loadbearing performance.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{traffic was}} sawn timber and firewood, with many sawmills located {{adjacent}} to the railway, or accessed by short tramways. Seasonally heavy potato traffic and a lime kiln added to revenue. Traffic grew to require up to 7 trains a day each way by the mid-1920s. The introduction of the Garratt locomotive allowed a new timetable with two trains each way between Colac and Beech Forest, and a third train each way to Gellibrand. The Crowes branch saw a single mixed train daily. The arrival of the Great Depression and competition from motor vehicles saw traffic decline {{to a point where}} only one train each way operated over the line three days a week. Increased wartime <b>loadings</b> saw traffic increase to two trains each way daily, however this improvement was only temporary. By the time the railway closed, the timetable listed only one train each way a week, and most of the traffic was pulpwood.|$|E
25|$|Many {{of these}} {{features}} make lanthanide complexes effective catalysts. Hard Lewis acids are able to polarise bonds upon coordination and thus alter the electrophilicity of compounds, with a classic example being the Luche reduction. The large size of the ions coupled with their labile ionic bonding allows even bulky coordinating species to bind and dissociate rapidly, resulting in very high turnover rates; thus excellent yields can often be achieved with <b>loadings</b> {{of only a few}} mol%. The lack of orbital interactions combined with the lanthanide contraction means that the lanthanides change in size across the series but that their chemistry remains much the same. This allows for easy tuning of the steric environments and examples exist where this has been used to improve the catalytic activity of the complex·6THF: New Anhydrous Lithium Lanthanide Binaphtholates and Their Use in Enantioselective Alkyl Addition to Aldehydes|journal=Organometallics|date=1 April 1999|volume=18|issue=8|pages=1366–1368|doi=10.1021/om981011s}} and change the nuclearity of metal clusters.|$|E
25|$|Construction for the 40-megawatt light-water {{nuclear reactor}} began in 1979 at the Al Tuwaitha Nuclear Center near Baghdad. The main reactor was dubbed Osirak (Osiraq) by the French, {{blending}} {{the name of}} Iraq {{with that of the}} reactor class. Iraq named the main reactor Tammuz 1 (Arabic: تموز) and the smaller Tammuz 2. Tammuz was the Babylonian month when the Ba'ath party had come to power in 1968. On 6 April 1979, Israeli agents sabotaged the Osirak reactor awaiting shipment to Iraq at La Seyne-sur-Mer in France. On the 14 June 1980, Mossad agents assassinated Yahya El Mashad, an Egyptian nuclear scientist who headed the Iraqi nuclear program, in a hotel in Paris, France. In July 1980, Iraq received from France a shipment of approximately 12.5kilograms of highly enriched uranium fuel {{to be used in the}} reactor. The shipment was the first of a planned six deliveries totalling 72kilograms. It was reportedly stipulated in the purchase agreement that no more than two HEU fuel <b>loadings,</b> 24kilograms, could be in Iraq at any time.|$|E
25|$|The Pelagornithidae had {{extremely}} thin-walled bones widely pneumatized {{with the}} air sac extensions of the lungs. Most limb bone fossils are very much crushed for that reason. In life, the thin bones and extensive pneumatization enabled the birds to achieve large size while remaining below critical wing <b>loadings.</b> Though 25kg/m2 (5lb/ft2) {{is regarded as the}} maximum wing loading for powered bird flight, there is evidence that bony-toothed birds used dynamic soaring flight almost exclusively: the proximal end of the humerus had an elongated diagonal shape that could hardly have allowed for the movement necessary for the typical flapping flight of birds; their weight thus cannot be easily estimated. The attachment positions for the muscles responsible for holding the upper arm straightly outstretched were particularly well-developed, and altogether the anatomy seems to allow for an ability of holding the wings rigidly at the glenoid joint unmatched by any other known bird. This is especially prominent in the Neogene pelagornithids, and less developed in the older Paleogene forms. The sternum had the deep and short shape typical of dynamic soarers, and bony outgrowths at the keel's forward margin securely anchored the furcula.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} combustion engine drives two clutch packs. The outer clutch pack drives gears 1, 3, 5 (and 7 when fitted), and reverse — the outer clutch pack has a larger diameter compared to the inner clutch, and can therefore handle greater torque <b>loadings.</b> The inner clutch pack drives gears 2, 4, and 6. Instead of a standard large dry single-plate clutch, each clutch pack for the six-speed DSG {{is a collection of}} four small wet interleaved clutch plates (similar to a motorcycle wet multi-plate clutch). Due to space constraints, the two clutch assemblies are concentric, and the shafts within the gearbox are hollow and also concentric. Because the alternate clutch pack's gear-sets can be pre-selected (predictive shifts enabled via the unloaded section of the gearbox), un-powered time while shifting is avoided because the transmission of torque is simply switched from one clutch-pack to the other. This means that the DSG takes only about 8milliseconds to upshift. In comparison, the sequential manual transmission (SMT) in the Ferrari F430 Scuderia takes 60milliseconds to shift, or 150milliseconds in the Ferrari Enzo. The quoted time for upshifts is the time the wheels are completely non-powered.|$|E
25|$|In older {{plants and}} those {{receiving}} variable <b>loadings,</b> trickling filter beds are used where the settled sewage liquor is spread {{onto the surface}} of a bed made up of coke (carbonized coal), limestone chips or specially fabricated plastic media. Such media must have large surface areas to support the biofilms that form. The liquor is typically distributed through perforated spray arms. The distributed liquor trickles through the bed and is collected in drains at the base. These drains also provide a source of air which percolates up through the bed, keeping it aerobic. Biofilms of bacteria, protozoa and fungi form on the media’s surfaces and eat or otherwise reduce the organic content. The filter removes {{a small percentage of the}} suspended organic matter, while the majority of the organic matter supports microorganism reproduction and cell growth from the biological oxidation and nitrification taking place in the filter. With this aerobic oxidation and nitrification, the organic solids are converted into biofilm grazed by insect larvae, snails, and worms which help maintain an optimal thickness. Overloading of beds may increase biofilm thickness leading to anaerobic conditions and possible bioclogging of the filter media and ponding on the surface.|$|E
