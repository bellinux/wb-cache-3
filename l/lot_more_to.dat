So I am very optimistic. I have come here prepared and thinking about these two races together. Not one, two." [...] Michael Schumacher emphasised the pressure of leading the championship going into Japan: [...] "It hasn't been a relaxing time at all and I still haven't completely got over the jetlag from the States.

500|$|Heskey {{played as}} a forward, being a {{powerful}} targetman gifted with pace and physical strength; {{he is also}} a hard working player. His play has been likened to [...] "a blunt instrument with which to bludgeon defences". His main contributions to the team lie in the way he holds the ball up and draws defenders out, leaving space behind him for another player to score. He has been credited as being an unselfish player who allows other forwards to benefit. He is not a prolific goalscorer but is able to provide a significant number of assists as a second striker. He has been quoted as saying [...] "Forwards are judged on their goalscoring. But I like to think I bring a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> the game and I do get pleasure from assisting". He impressed the England staff with his versatility, as he can also play down the left wing. However, he has been criticised by the media for his lack of goals; lapses in his goalscoring have been described as being [...] "hardly uncommon". In 2008 it was stated that [...] "It is only the perception of his talents that changes" [...] after Heskey stated he was no better or worse than before.|$|E

Charlie gave birth to Ruby after she was raped by Grant Bledcoe (Clayton Watson), when she was younger.

She said she had to let it affect her own emotions to effect the viewing public. [...] "The revelation ruins their relationship, and Anderson said that Charlie was [...] "trying desperately to bridge this gap". Breeds added [...] "Ruby just wants to get some security back, everything she thought her life was is totally up in the air". Ruby becomes confused and starts to ask herself questions such as [...] "Where do I stand now?" [...] and [...] "How do I reconcile this?" [...] Breeds said it was a [...] "big exploration" [...] and a journey for Ruby, with Anderson agreeing. Anderson felt there was a beautiful element to the storyline and opined: [...] "Although it is tragic, you feel sorry for Charlie and you can sort of understand where it has all come from." [...] She added that everyone feels sorry for Ruby, meaning neither are wrong. Furthermore, she said, [...] "You are just rooting for them, you just want them to get back to how they were and it {{is a bit of a}} journey."

500|$|The episode {{has been}} {{generally}} well received, being praised by many critics for its writing.

The show's scripters {{came up with}} a plot device far more ingenious than simply dropping the singer into Springfield." [...] Monica Collins of the Boston Herald also enjoyed the episode. On the day it first aired, she wrote that [...] "This episode is vintage Simpsons, crammed with divinely vulgar visual oddities. And Michael Jackson, of course, is just so weird anyway that he fits right in." [...] Mark Lorando of The Times-Picayune commented that [...] "throwaway lines on The Simpsons are funnier than the big punchlines on most so-called comedy series; [...] has layers of humor, satirical touches that enrich the story lines," [...] singling out jokes like the America's Funniest Home Video parody. [...] "The laughs are literally non-stop, and Jackson's unmistakable vocal presence [...] adds a thousand watts of star power." [...] In 2011, Television Blend's Eric Eisenberg named [...] "Stark Raving Dad" [...] the best episode of the entire series. He praised it for being heartful and stated that what [...] "prevents the episode from seeming artificial or manipulative is that the writing in the episode earns the earnest moments", and further elaborates that while [...] "strong emotions might be the hallmark of 'Stark Raving Dad,' it would be a sincere mistake to ignore how funny it is." [...] He concluded that the episode [...] "is perfectly constructed, is filled with both deep belly laughs and tears, and is simply the greatest episode of The Simpsons" ...|$|E

2500|$|The album {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics.

[...] He goes on to call [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] "unbearably soft," [...] summing up that the album was a [...] "career low," [...] while he still rated the album three out of five stars. Music critic Robert Christgau gave the album a [...] "B+" [...] deemed both [...] "She Belongs to Me" [...] and [...] "Crummy Stuff" [...] to be [...] "defensive-sounding" [...] but called [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] an anthem, while also praising [...] "My Head Is Hanging Upside Down (Bonzo Goes to Bitburg)."

Godziszewski also praised the film's monster scenes, feeling they were executed better than Pacific Rim, stating, [...] "Instead the monster battles in Godzilla 2014 were staged much more like a Japanese film. You get to see prolonged shots of the monsters in action, filmed {{in a way that}} the action was easy to understand" [...] and concluded by stating, [...] "Since G2014 delivered that, I could overlook the relatively weak drama and the lack of social conscience. It's unsatisfying that they made Godzilla into a secondary player in his own film, but at least when the monsters were on screen, they delivered the goods." ...|$|E
