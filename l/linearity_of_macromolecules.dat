40|$|Investigations of {{bioactive}} copper complexes are {{of great}} interest for the pharmaceutical industry from the aspect of therapy of hypochromic microcitary anemia and hypocupremia. The structure of bioactive copper complexes with oligosaccharides {{has not yet been}} explained in details despite a number of studies. This work represents further development in the research of the complex structure and pharmacobiological activity of the copper complexes. Different copper complexes with dextran and pullulan oligosaccharides, as well as reduced derivatives, have been analyzed by IR spectroscopy. Characterization of the complexes has been performed by using modern spectroscopic techniques: RT-FTIR, LNT-FTIR, D 2 O-FTIR, ATR-FTIR and FTIR microspectroscopy. Results of FTIR microspectroscopic investigations show that the structural form of complexes and copper content depend considerably on constitution and ligands conformation, degree of crystallinity, polymerization, polydispersity, and <b>linearity</b> <b>of</b> <b>macromolecules.</b> Also, stability of the synthesized complexes, as well as their pharmacological effect, depend on these parameters. Based on IR testing results, structures of the synthesized Cu(II) complexes with polysaccharides were confirmed...|$|E

40|$|In vivo {{localized}} proton {{magnetic resonance}} spectroscopy (1 H MRS) became a powerful and unique technique to non-invasively investigate brain metabolism of rodents and humans. The main goal of 1 H MRS is the reliable quantification of concentrations of metabolites (neurochemical profile) in a well-defined region of the brain. The availability of very high magnetic field strengths combined {{with the possibility of}} acquiring spectra at very short echo time have dramatically increased the number of constituents of the neurochemical profile. The quantification of spectra measured at short echo times is complicated by the presence <b>of</b> <b>macromolecule</b> signals <b>of</b> particular importance at high magnetic fields. An error in the macromolecule estimation can lead to substantial errors in the obtained neurochemical profile. The purpose of the present review is to overview methods of high field 1 H MRS with a focus on the metabolite quantification, in particular in handling signals <b>of</b> <b>macromolecules.</b> Three main approaches of handling signals <b>of</b> <b>macromolecules</b> are described, namely mathematical estimation <b>of</b> <b>macromolecules,</b> measurement <b>of</b> <b>macromolecules</b> in vivo, and direct acquisition of the in vivo spectrum without the contribution <b>of</b> <b>macromolecules...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{order to}} make the best {{compromise}} between the damping force and the <b>linearity</b> <b>of</b> the integrated relative displacement sensor (IRDS) of an integrated relative dis-placement self-sensing magnetorheological damper (IRDSMRD), a Pareto optimization-based method, which optimizes the key structural parameters by taking the damping force and the <b>linearity</b> <b>of</b> the IRDS of the IRDSMRD as the objective functions, is proposed and realized in this article. The Pareto front, representing the best tradeoff between the damping force and the <b>linearity</b> <b>of</b> the IRDS of the IRDSMRD, is obtained by considering that the maximum magnetomotive force applied to the exciting coil of the IRDSMRD is constant. Three IRDSMRDs with different piston modules, which are determined according to the Pareto optimal solutions, are developed and tested. The research results indicate that every point on the Pareto front is an optimal solution that compromises the damping force and the <b>linearity</b> <b>of</b> the IRDS of the IRDSMRD and the optimal damping force of the IRDSMRD with a certain <b>linearity</b> <b>of</b> the IRDS as well as the optimal <b>linearity</b> <b>of</b> the IRDS with a certain damping force can be determined according to the Pareto front for a specific application...|$|R

30|$|It {{is known}} that the {{kinetics}} of electron transport in the RCs of purple bacteria [1 â€“ 3] and {{the shape of the}} curve of chlorophyll fluorescence in the complex of photosystem II in thylakoid grana are multiexponential in nature [4]. As a rule, this is explained by a multilevel organizational structure <b>of</b> <b>macromolecules</b> and a manifestation of self-regulation effect on the structural and dynamic properties <b>of</b> biological <b>macromolecules</b> in non-equilibrium operating conditions. This effect is determined by certain hidden parameters among which structural variables that characterize the state <b>of</b> <b>macromolecules</b> can act. While these parameters are difficult to measure directly in experiment, they impact the kinetics of basic reaction in macromolecules along with control parameters (substrate concentration, light intensity, etc.). Due to changes in the structure <b>of</b> <b>macromolecules,</b> a feedback in the basic reaction occurs. This feedback links the recurring elementary acts of the basic reaction. The elementary acts lead to significant changes in the structure <b>of</b> <b>macromolecules.</b> They modify the very elementary reaction and provide adaptive functioning <b>of</b> the <b>macromolecules.</b> The effect <b>of</b> self-regulation can occur with different amounts of structural variables. These factors make it difficult to analyze the basic reaction, and the kinetics of this reaction assumes a multiexponential character. Therefore, there is a problem, using the experimentally measured kinetics of basic reaction, to identify the stationary states and self-consistent reorganizations <b>of</b> <b>macromolecules,</b> which are reflected by monoexponential components of the basic reaction.|$|R

Local differences in crowding that arise {{as a result of}} subcellular components and supramolecular assemblies contribute to the structural organization of the cytoplasm. In this Opinion article we discuss how macromolecular crowding affects the physicochemistry of the cytoplasm and how this, in turn, affects microbial physiology. We propose that cells maintain the overall concentration <b>of</b> <b>macromolecules</b> within a narrow range and discuss possible mechanisms for achieving crowding homeostasis.

50|$|These high {{concentrations}} <b>of</b> <b>macromolecules</b> occupy {{a large proportion}} of the volume of the cell, which reduces the volume of solvent that is available for other macromolecules. This excluded volume effect increases the effective concentration <b>of</b> <b>macromolecules</b> (increasing their chemical activity), which in turn alters the rates and equilibrium constants of their reactions. In particular this effect alters dissociation constants by favoring the association <b>of</b> <b>macromolecules,</b> such as when multiple proteins come together to form protein complexes, or when DNA-binding proteins bind to their targets in the genome. Crowding may also affect enzyme reactions involving small molecules if the reaction involves a large change in the shape of the enzyme.|$|R
