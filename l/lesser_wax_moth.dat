50|$|So far no traps {{have been}} found that {{completely}} protect honeycombs from the invasion of <b>lesser</b> <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> larva.|$|E
50|$|Only 41 {{species of}} {{parasitoid}} lepidopterans are known (1 Pyralidae; 40 Epipyropidae). The larvae {{of the greater}} and <b>lesser</b> <b>wax</b> <b>moths</b> feed on the honeycomb inside bee nests and may become pests; they are also found in bumblebee and wasp nests, albeit to a lesser extent. In northern Europe, the <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> {{is regarded as the}} most serious parasitoid of the bumblebee, and is found only in bumblebee nests. In some areas in southern England, as much as 80% of nests can be destroyed. Other parasitic larvae are known to prey upon cicadas and leaf hoppers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lesser</b> <b>wax</b> <b>moths</b> {{are very}} common {{in most parts of}} the world, except the colder regions, aided in their spread by humans who have involuntarily {{introduced}} them to many countries. They are known or suspected to inhabit most of Africa (including Madagascar), Australia, Europe (expect perhaps some more remote regions, particularly in Greece) and North America, as well as parts of the Neotropics (at least Colombia, Jamaica, Puerto Rico and Trinidad), the Bengal region, Japan, Sri Lanka, and the Marquesas Islands and Tahiti in French Polynesia.|$|R
50|$|Populations {{of these}} moths {{take over the}} {{honeycombs}} of bee colonies, usually when the bees are in a weakened state. <b>Lesser</b> <b>wax</b> <b>moths</b> can often be seen in bee colonies trying to lay their eggs, {{but in most cases}} the worker bees will eliminate them and keep the moths from over-running the colony. When the colony is going through a period of stress, such as after the loss of its queen bee or under starvation conditions, the moths may completely take over the honeycomb.|$|R
50|$|Its close relative, the <b>lesser</b> <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> (Achroia grisella), is also {{a member}} of tribe Galleriini of the pyralid {{subfamily}} Galleriinae. The greater wax moth is the type species of this tribe and subfamily.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> {{typically}} {{resides in}} milder climates, {{but can be}} prevalent {{in areas such as}} Florida because of the year-round warm climate. These moths live around seven months, from egg to adulthood. They go through four stages in their life cycle [...] - [...] egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa and imago [...] - [...] like all holometabolous insects.|$|E
5000|$|Achroia grisella, the <b>lesser</b> <b>wax</b> <b>moth,</b> {{is a small}} moth of {{the snout}} moth family (Pyralidae), wherein {{it belongs to the}} {{subfamily}} Galleriinae. It is the only unequivocally recognized species of genus Achroia. The greater wax moth (Galleria mellonella) is a quite close relative; though placed in a distinct genus, it still belongs to the same tribe [...] - [...] the Galleriini [...] - [...] within the Galleriinae.|$|E
50|$|In the colder climates, storing the beeswax combs in {{freezing}} winter temperatures {{will stop}} there from being {{any chance of}} a <b>moth</b> infestation. <b>Lesser</b> <b>wax</b> <b>moths</b> need warm climates to thrive. There is also a fumigant known as paradichlorobenzene (PDB) {{that is used to}} destroy these moths. This can only be used on combs that are in storage. They are not successful on combs that currently are filled with honey. Carbon dioxide can be used to fumigate combs that are filled with honey. It ensures that the honey is still acceptable to be sold.|$|R
40|$|Female <b>lesser</b> <b>wax</b> <b>moths</b> (Achroia grisella) choose males {{based on}} {{characters}} of their ultrasonic advertisement signals. Because a female's opportunity to obtain increased somatic benefits by mating {{with a particular}} male is limited, we investigated whether females obtain genetic benefits for their offspring via mate choice. Controlled breeding experiments conducted under favourable food and temperature conditions showed that developmental characters are heritable, that sire attractiveness and offspring survivorship are unrelated, but that females mating with attractive signallers produce offspring who mature faster than the offspring of females mating with non-attractive signallers. However, under some unfavourable food or temperature conditions, it is the offspring of females mating with non-attractive males who mature faster; these offspring are heavier as well. Thus, the relationship between male attractiveness and offspring development is not environmentally robust, and support for a good genes model of mate choice in A. grisella is dependent on conditions. These findings suggest genotypeâ€“environment interactions and emphasize the necessity of testing sexual selection models under a range of natural environments...|$|R
50|$|Most {{of these}} small moths are inconspicuous. Many are {{economically}} important pests, including waxworms, which are the caterpillar larvae of the greater (Galleria mellonella) and <b>lesser</b> (Achroia grisella) <b>wax</b> <b>moths</b> (subfamily Galleriinae). They are natively pests of beehives, but are bred indoors in enormous numbers as live food for small reptile and bird pets and similar animals. They are also used as fishing bait for trout fishing.|$|R
5000|$|Waxworms are the {{caterpillar}} larvae of wax moths, which {{belong to}} the family Pyralidae (snout moths). Two closely related species are commercially bred [...] - [...] the <b>lesser</b> <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> (Achroia grisella) and the greater wax moth (Galleria mellonella). They {{belong to the}} tribe Galleriini in the snout moth subfamily Galleriinae. Another species whose larvae share that name is the Indian mealmoth (Plodia interpunctella), though this species is not available commercially.|$|E
50|$|The {{caterpillars}} of the <b>lesser</b> <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> {{can be very}} {{destructive to}} the honeycomb. They were first seen in North America in 1806, and {{are believed to have}} been imported there with honeybees from Europe. It has been estimated that annually, beekeepers lose nearly 5 million US dollars in damages due to these pests. There are many methods of control that beekeepers have adopted to ensure that these moths do not ruin the combs.|$|E
50|$|Their {{downfall}} begins when, in {{a moment}} of carelessness, the guardians of the hive allow it to be infiltrated by a <b>lesser</b> <b>wax</b> <b>moth,</b> Achroia grisella. When her eggs hatch, the larvae devour honey and wax and undermine the structure of the hive, which leads to even worse problems. More and more bees are hatched with freakish deformities. Honoured traditions collapse. The only hope for salvation is hatching and rearing a secret clandestine princess.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} the morphology of the reproductive tract and ovariole histology of koinobiont solitary early instar larval endoparasitoid Apanteles galleriae Wilkinson (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) reared on two lepidopteran species, greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella (L.) and <b>lesser</b> <b>wax</b> <b>moth,</b> Achoria grisella Fabr. (both Pyralidae). The work {{did not reveal}} any apparent difference between the morphology of either males or females as well as histology of females reared on two different hosts. The internal organs of reproductive system in A. galleriae adults conform mostly to the basic plan displayed in other parasitoid species. However, {{the system is not}} typically hymenopteran in that ovarioles unite before calyx. The ovipositor anatomy is typical of terebrantes in general. Vesicula seminalis and accessory glands were found united in males. Our results may be beneficial for success in biological control applications as well as they might be of value in phylogenetic, evolutionary, and systematic studies...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSperm {{competition}} {{has been demonstrated}} {{to be a strong}} selective force shaping male mating behaviours and ejaculate traits, particularly in highly polyandrous species. Its effect, however, is expected to be limited in lek mating systems, where female mating decisions appear relatively unconstrained and thus female remating rate is generally low. Hence, testing for male adaptations to sperm competition in lek mating species is of particular importance in order to understand whether and how sperm competition, as a selective force, may also have shaped male phenotype in such systems. Here, we investigated copulation behaviour and strategic sperm allocation in the lekking <b>lesser</b> <b>wax</b> <b>moth,</b> Achroia grisella, a well-established model for studying precopulatory sexual selection as males produce elaborate ultra-sonic courtship songs targeted by female choice. Recent evidence suggests that females do sometimes remate, thus creating a selective potential for sperm competition. To test the hypothesis that sperm competition also selects for male adaptations in ejaculate traits in lek mating systems, we staged experimental matings after males had experienced either a competitive (one competitor present) or a noncompetitive (no competitor present) social environment during early adulthood. Males increased sperm transfer rate and thereby allocated higher proportions of available sperm reserves during virgin copulations when experiencing the elevated sperm competition risk environment. Our study provides the first evidence of strategic sperm allocation in relation to sperm competition risk in a lekking insect, demonstrating that sperm competition might represent an important selective force in such mating systems...|$|E

40|$|There is {{an urgent}} need for new {{antimicrobial}} agents to combat infections caused by drug-resistant pathogens. Once a compound is shown {{to be effective in}} vitro, it is necessary to evaluate its efficacy in an animal infection model. Typically, this is achieved using a mammalian model, but such experiments are costly, time consuming, and require full ethical consideration. Hence, cheaper and ethically more acceptable invertebrate models of infection have been introduced, including the larvae of the greater <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> Galleria mellonella. Invertebrates have an immune system that is functionally similar to the innate immune system of mammals, and often identical virulence and pathogenicity factors are used by human pathogenic microbes to infect <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> larvae and mammals. Moreover, the virulence of many human pathogens is comparable in <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> larvae and mammals. Using key examples from the literature, this chapter highlights the benefits of using the <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> larva model to provide a rapid, inexpensive, and reliable evaluation of the toxicity and efficacy of new antimicrobial agents in vivo and prior to the use of more expensive mammalian models. This simple insect model can bridge the gap between in vitro studies and mammalian experimentation by screening out compounds with a low likelihood of success, while providing greater justification for further studies in mammalian systems. Thus, broader implementation of the <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> larva model into anti- infective drug discovery and development programs could reduce the use of mammals during preclinical assessments and the overall cost of drug development...|$|R

40|$|The greater <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> Galleria mellonella L. (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), {{one of the}} pests {{of honey}} bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies, has spread almost all over the world. Although the G. mellonella is often {{reported}} to infest weak honey bee colonies that are exposed to pesticides and diseases, {{it is also a}} threat for healthy colonies. Therefore, there is a fairly high probability of transmission of both microflora-specific bacteria and pathogen microorganisms, especially Nosema species, between these organisms (Moth and bees). The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the presence of Nosema species in greater <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> G. mellonella collected from apiaries as well as grown in laboratory conditions. Adults and late instar larva of <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> were used for detecting Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae. Real-time PCR amplification studies were performed and specific ITS regions were targeted to distinguish Nosema species. Real-time PCR results showed that N. apis and N. ceranae were found in both phases of G. mellonella. This is the first study to confirm that N. apis and N. ceranae are present in greater <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> collected from apiaries and grown at laboratories in Turkey...|$|R

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} a serious honey bee (Apis mellifera) disease, the American foulbrood (AFB), and with {{possibilities}} of its control. The thesis {{is divided into two}} parts, the theoretical and the experimental. The theoretical part is written as a research and contains two big chapters. The first one describes American foulbrood disease and its causative agent, bacteria Paenibacillus larvae. The second part deals with the <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> (Galleria mellonella). The experimental part then combines above mentioned themes in an effort to find the relationship between the <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> caterpillars and bacteria P. larvae that could possibly help to control the AFB. The aim of this work was to determine whether the <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> can disrupt resistant layers of P. larvae spores thanks to its well adapted digestive tract and whether it could change their germination...|$|R
40|$|Objectives - To {{investigate}} whether the <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> larva, Galleria mellonella, is a suitable host {{for assessing the}} in vivo efficacy of antistaphylococcal agents against Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections. Methods - <b>Wax</b> <b>moth</b> larvae were infected with increasing doses of S. aureus to investigate the effect of inoculum size on larval survival. In addition, infected <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> larvae were treated with daptomycin, penicillin or vancomycin to examine whether these agents were effective against S. aureus and MRSA infections in vivo. Results - Increasing inoculum doses of live S. aureus cells resulted in greater larval mortality, but heat-killed bacteria and cell-free culture filtrates had no detrimental effects on survival. Larval mortality rate also depended on the post-inoculation incubation temperature. After larvae were infected with S. aureus, larval survival was enhanced by administering the antistaphylococcal antibiotics daptomycin or vancomycin. Larval survival increased with increasing doses of the antibiotics. Moreover, penicillin improved survival of larvae infected with a penicillin-susceptible methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) strain, but it was ineffective at similar doses in larvae infected with MRSA (penicillin resistant). Daptomycin and vancomycin were also effective when administered to the larvae prior to infection with bacteria. Conclusions - This is the first report to demonstrate that antibiotics are effective in the <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> larva model {{for the treatment of}} infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria. The new <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> larva model is a useful preliminary model for assessing the in vivo efficacy of candidate antistaphylococcal agents before proceeding to mammalian studies, which may reduce animal experimentation and expense...|$|R
