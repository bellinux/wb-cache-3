500|$|Barrett, by the {{beginning}} of the recording sessions for A Saucerful of Secrets, was already shrinking into a delirious state of mind, exacerbated by his feelings of alienation from the rest of the band. The common interpretation of the lyrics is that they reflect his schizophrenia and it has been argued that they could also be read as a criticism of the other band members for forcing him out. King said of the song: [...] "The most alienated, extraordinary lyrics. It's not addressed to the band, it's addressed to the whole world. He was completely cut off." [...] Jenner said [...] "I think every psychiatrist should be made to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> songs [...] I think they should be part of the curriculum of every medical college along with those Van Gogh paintings like The Crows." ...|$|E
500|$|... "One More Chance" [...] is an {{acoustic}} pop ballad. It {{is set in}} the time signature of common time, having a tempo of 92 beats per minute. The song is played in the key of F major, with a basic sequence of Cmaj7–Bm7–Am7–Bm7 as its chord progression, while piano and guitar are used to play the background music. Madonna's voice spans from G3 to B4. The verses start off with F major and then the chorus leans towards D minor, the bridge and the ending sections changes to D major. Louis Virtel from Idolator said on the song [...] " [...] begs for forgiveness, and her only accompaniment is stark acoustic strumming." [...] Madonna utilized her vocal lessons for Evita during the recording of [...] "You'll See" [...] and [...] "One More Chance". She said [...] "If you <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> songs, you can hear how I was trying to absorb and utilize what I was learning for the recording of Evita." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, {{said that the}} song was [...] "Perfectly acceptable, though {{not in the same}} class as 'Who's That Girl'." [...] Christian Wright from Spin called the song celebratory. Camille Paglia, {{one of the authors of}} The Madonna Companion: Two Decades of Commentary, said that Madonna's command of massive, resonant basslines impressed her. She wrote: [...] "I recall my stunned admiration as I sat in the theater in 1987 and first experienced the crashing, descending chords of Madonna's 'Causing a Commotion', which opened her dreadful movie Who's That Girl. If you want to hear the essence of modernity, <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> chords, infernal, apocalyptic, and grossly sensual. This is the authentic voice of fin de siècle." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commented that [...] "Causing a Commotion" [...] and [...] "Who's That Girl" [...] were not among Madonna's best singles.|$|E

500|$|Musically, [...] "You'll See" [...] is an {{acoustic}} pop ballad. It {{is set in}} the time signature of common time, having a tempo of 120 beats per minute. The song is played in the key of G Major, with a basic sequence of Em–D–Em as its chord progression during the first verse, while piano and guitar are used to play the background music. The sequence shifts to Em–C–D–G–C–F during the chorus. Madonna's voice spans from G3 to C5. Throughout the chord changes progression to give Madonna's vocals dominance in the song, and after a minute the percussion starts with a tremolo guitar added later. String synths and drums build the track further with the second verse seeing the singer harmonizing with herself. During the recording of the track, the singer used her vocal lessons for Evita; she said [...] "If you <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> songs, you can hear how I was trying to absorb and utilize what I was learning for the recording [...]" [...] Lyrically the song talks of independence after the end of a love affair stating that Madonna will go onto greater things. When asked if the track was about revenge, the singer replied: [...] "No, it's about empowering yourself", but also adding that [...] "there's another side too which is—'Don't fuck with me, I don't need anybody. I can do what I want'".|$|E
500|$|In William Faulkner's novel, Sanctuary, a [...] "heaven-tree" [...] {{stands outside}} the Jefferson jail, where Lee Goodwin and a [...] "negro murderer" [...] are incarcerated. The tree is {{associated}} with the black prisoner's despair in the face of his impending execution and the spirituals that he sings in chorus with other black people who keep a sort of vigil in the street below:...they sang spirituals while white people slowed and stopped in the leafed darkness that was almost summer, to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> who were sure to die and him who was already dead singing about heaven and being tired; or perhaps in the interval between songs a rich, sourceless voice coming out of the high darkness where the ragged shadow of the heaven-tree which snooded the street lamp at the corner fretted and mourned: [...] "Fo days mo! Den dey ghy stroy de bes ba'yton singer in nawth Mississippi!"Upon the barred and slitted wall the splotched shadow of the heaven-tree shuddered and pulsed monstrously in scarce any wind; rich and sad, the singing fell behind.Ailanthus is also sometimes counter-nicknamed [...] "tree from hell" [...] due to its prolific invasiveness and the difficulty in eradicating it. In certain parts of the United States, the species has been nicknamed the [...] "ghetto palm" [...] because of its propensity for growing in the inhospitable conditions of urban areas, or on abandoned and poorly maintained properties, such as in war-torn Afghanistan.|$|E
500|$|In a less {{enthusiastic}} review, Time Out Sydney {{felt that}} the album is unfortunately Brian Eno's new album rather than U2's: [...] "for all that's new, there's no way that you'll mistake it for another band." [...] Pitchfork Media reviewer Ryan Dombal gave a score of 4.2 out of 10, stating, [...] "the album's ballyhooed experimentation is either terribly misguided or hidden underneath a wash of shameless U2-isms." [...] Kaj Roth of Melodic magazine described it as [...] "more electronic and less rock" [...] and stating {{that part of the}} album [...] "reminds just too much of their early 90's records". Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun gave a rating of three and a half stars, comparing it to the 1990s albums Zooropa, Pop, and Original Soundtracks 1 while stating [...] "This is no blockbuster... It's the least immediate U2 album in years, but one that diehard fans will enjoy living with". Madeleine Chong of MTV Asia wrote that, [...] "Although U2 should be lauded for their efforts at constant reinvention and pushing the envelope in the rock genre, [...] possesses neither the iconic qualities of The Joshua Tree or the radical yet relevant magnetism of Achtung Baby." [...] Toronto Star music critic Ben Rayner called the songs boring, adding that the ambience introduced by Eno and Lanois was [...] "often all these vague, hook-deficient songs have going for them." [...] Rob Harvilla of The Village Voice gave the album a mixed review and wrote that its songs [...] "will remind you of other, much better songs, but in a way that only makes you want to go and <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> other songs instead." [...] Time magazine also gave it an unfavourable review, calling the effort [...] "unsatisfied" [...] and [...] "mostly restless, tentative and confused." ...|$|E

2500|$|On February 27, 2014 the Board of Directors of the Institute in Basic Life Principles placed Gothard on {{indefinite}} administrative leave {{while it}} investigated {{claims that he}} sexually harassed several female employees and volunteers. [...] No criminal activity was uncovered, but an investigation found that Gothard had acted in an [...] "inappropriate manner". The claims had been publicized on Recovering Grace, a website, Christian ministry, and support group for former followers of Gothard's teachings. As many as 34 women who worked for Gothard claim that he harassed them; four claim that he molested them, {{and one of the}} accusers claims that Gothard molested her when she was 16 years old. Gothard denied the allegations and admitted no wrongdoing but announced his resignation from the Institute in order [...] "to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> who have ought [...] against him.". [...] According to ATI administrative director David Waller, Gothard felt compelled to resign in order to comply with a directive in the Gospel of Matthew to [...] "go and be reconciled" [...] if [...] "your brother or sister has something against you." ...|$|E
2500|$|As he grew, Abraham {{began taking}} outside jobs, often working for twenty-five cents a day {{clearing}} land, plowing fields, and building fences. When {{he was not}} working, he {{spent a great deal}} of time at the James Gentry General Store and the two nearby grain mills in the small town, where he liked to tell stories and <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> of older men. He also read widely and borrowed books from anyone who would lend them. During his several trips into the county seat of Rockport, Abraham became acquainted with the lawyers John Pitcher and John Breckenridge, who inspired his interest in the law. [...] Later he followed that profession. During this period, he made his first trip with the businessman Allen Gentry by flatboat down to New Orleans to sell produce and bring home supplies. He earned eight dollars from the trip. [...] It is traditionally believed that this was when he first saw a slave market. From his experiences and the influences of the anti-slavery men in Indiana and locally, Abraham began to form his opinions against slavery. After fourteen years in southern Indiana, in March 1830, Thomas Lincoln moved his family to central Illinois.|$|E
