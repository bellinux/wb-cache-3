50|$|Rail Services Inc. was {{responsible}} for operations of the Abbeville-Grimes Railway using locomotives and rolling stock supplied by the <b>Bay</b> <b>Line</b> Railroad. On January 1, 1994, the <b>Bay</b> <b>Line</b> was sold to Rail Management Corporation with the Abbeville-Grimes Railway included in the purchase. The name was shortened to the A&G railroad and continued to operate with <b>Bay</b> <b>Line</b> locomotives. The A&G was formally merged into the <b>Bay</b> <b>Line</b> on June 26, 1996, and ceased to exist as a separate entity.|$|R
50|$|Interlining was {{discontinued}} {{because of}} the confusion and delays, {{although it has been}} argued that it was politically motivated and that the experiment was sabotaged by the TTC, perhaps even designed to fail from the start. Much of the infrastructure for interlining is still present on the system, and most older stations still have signs informing passengers of each trainâ€™s next destination, although they no longer change. While St. George and Bloor-Yonge Stations remained operating upper and lower platforms for the two crossing subway <b>lines,</b> <b>Bay</b> Station would be served by only the Bloor-Danforth <b>line.</b> Lower <b>Bay</b> was closed to the public.|$|R
50|$|New Poole Junction {{was renamed}} Poole Junction in January 1875, and after further renamings became Broadstone.

5000|$|Post-WW2, in 1946 it {{was renamed}} [...] "Kensington (Olympia)" [...] {{and became the}} {{northern}} terminus of a peak-hour shuttle service to Clapham Junction, which was mainly for workers at the Post Office Savings Bank (later National Savings Bank) in nearby Blythe Road. There was also a District line shuttle to Earl's Court. The current District <b>line</b> <b>bay</b> platform opened in 1958, but the 1872 connection between the District and the main line south of the station was not finally lifted until 1992.|$|E
5000|$|... 65th Street Terminal was {{a station}} on the {{demolished}} section of the BMT Fifth Avenue Line. It was served by trains of the BMT Fifth Avenue Line, and despite {{the name of the}} line was actually located at Third Avenue and 65th Street. It had two tracks and one island platform. The station had connections to the Bay Ridge Suburban <b>Line,</b> <b>Bay</b> Ridge Line, Third Avenue Line, and 86th Street Suburban Line trolleys. Today, the western terminus of the Belt Parkway at the interchange with the Gowanus Expressway {{can be found in the}} vicinity.|$|E

The town is drained primarily by Gardner Creek and Hughes Branch, both tributaries of Lick Creek (which is in turn a tributary of the Nolichucky River).|$|R
50|$|Wickford station {{comprises}} {{two main}} line platforms (platform 2 for eastbound services and 3 for westbound services towards London), and two branch <b>line</b> <b>bay</b> platforms (numbers 1, {{which is used}} for trains from Southminster and 4, which is very rarely used) at {{the eastern end of}} the station. At the London end of the station there once was a goods yard and turntable for steam locomotives; a couple of sidings remain here for storing engineering vehicles or failed trains, but much of the railway land here is now in use as a car park for passengers.|$|E
5000|$|Director Bay did {{not like}} the script and often engaged Smith and Lawrence in discussions about how the {{dialogue}} and scenes could improve. He often allowed them to improvise while the cameras were rolling. He secretly told Smith to call Lawrence a bitch before the car scene. The whole [...] "two bitches in the sea" [...] was improvised, as was Martin's comment when Leoni called him gay. The scene in the convenience store, wherein the clerk puts a gun to Burnett and Lowrey's heads and yells, telling them to [...] "Freeze, mother bitches!", is also improvised. They came up with: [...] "No, you freeze, bitch! Now back up, put the gun down and get me a pack of Tropical Fruit Bubbalicious". [...] "And some Skittles." [...] According to Bay in the DVD commentary, {{at the end of the}} film when Mike and Marcus are recuperating, Mike says [...] "I love you, man." [...] Bay claims that Smith refused to say the line, causing the director and actor to argue back and forth over the <b>line.</b> <b>Bay</b> wanted Smith to say the line as he felt it summed up the friendship between the cops. After their argument had lasted for half of the day's shoot and much of the crew was ready to pack up, a fed up Bay told Smith to do whatever he wanted, after which Smith changed his mind and agreed to say the line.|$|E
30|$|In smart substation, <b>line</b> <b>bay</b> has {{the most}} switch ports. Generally, one <b>line</b> <b>bay</b> {{includes}} 1 merging unit, 1 intelligent terminal unit, 2 line protection devices and 1 BCU. Five switch ports is enough for one bay, but a switch generally has 16 ports, which are enough for 3 bays. When a switch used for 3 bays is faulty, all the 3 bays will lose their protection, measuring and control functions. The solution is to limit the connected ports of a switch for only one bay. In this way, the failure of one switch will only affect one bay.|$|E
5000|$|Nashville {{scored in}} the seventh inning with the bases loaded. With two outs, catcher Ed Hurlburt hit a single. Then Sitton did too. Harry [...] "Deerfoot" [...] Bay bunted {{perfectly}} down the third base <b>line,</b> <b>Bay's</b> fondest memory in his long baseball career. Julius Augustus [...] "Doc" [...] Wiseman then drove in the winning run. Sitton was thrown out at home after Hurlburt scored. The time of the game was one hour and forty-two minutes.|$|R

5|$|By {{the time}} of John Moncure Robinson's {{retirement}} {{as president of the}} company in 1893, the Old <b>Bay</b> <b>Line</b> had upgraded its fleet with propeller-driven, steel-hulled steamers equipped with modern conveniences such as electric lighting and staterooms with private baths. The Georgia introduced in 1887 was the first Old <b>Bay</b> <b>Line</b> boat to have a modern screw propeller instead of old-fashioned side paddlewheels and the Alabama launched in 1893 was the company's first steel-hulled vessel. Robinson served the Old <b>Bay</b> <b>Line</b> as president for 26years (1867â€“1893), longer than any other person in the company's history.|$|R
