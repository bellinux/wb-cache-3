40|$|Coordinated {{multipoint}} (CoMP) {{transmission and}} reception {{is the key}} technique in LTE-Advanced to improve the cell-edge throughput and/or system throughput. Joint processing (JP) in CoMP technology provides multiple data transmission points for each user among multiple cooperated radio base stations. Hard handover mechanism is adopted {{to be used in}} LTE-Advanced. Standard hard handover algorithm could not satisfy the concept of JP in CoMP in LTE-A due to the constraint of single connection for each user at any time. While the radio resources in the system are fixed, the more multiple data connections a user has, the more radio resources are used for the extra data connections, thus the lower capacity a system becomes. Therefore a new handover algorithm that not only supports JP in CoMP but also takes system capacity into consideration in LTE-A system is necessary. This paper proposes a new handover algorithm known as <b>Limited</b> <b>CoMP</b> Handover Algorithm to support JP in CoMP and overcome the system capacity issue. System performance of <b>Limited</b> <b>CoMP</b> Handover Algorithm is evaluated and compared with open literature handover algorithm via simulation in this paper. The simulation results show that <b>Limited</b> <b>CoMP</b> Handover Algorithm outperforms open literature handover algorithm by having shorter system delay and less system load whilst maintaining a higher system throughput in a high congested network...|$|E
30|$|The {{simulation}} {{results show that}} with equal bit allocation, the optimal power allocation can remarkably improve EE in spite of user locations. Moreover, the EE can be further improved by using the optimal bit allocation. From d= 250 to d= 200 m, the EE gain of the optimal bit allocation over equal bit allocation increases significantly, since it is more beneficial to use the bit allocation for exploiting the heterogeneity of large-scale channel gains from desired and interfering BSs. The results highlight the importance of joint power and bit allocation to improve the EE in <b>limited</b> feedback <b>CoMP</b> system.|$|R
30|$|The PA {{may have}} a large impact on the {{performance}} of per‐cell codebook‐based <b>limited</b> feedback coherent <b>CoMP</b> systems, depending on the methods of codeword selection, as analyzed in [13]. In this section, we investigate whether the PA feedback is necessary by comparing the performance with and without the PA feedback. As shown in [13], the performance gain of feeding back the PA with joint codeword selection is not significant, while the performance loss of not feeding back the PA with independent codeword selection is severe. Therefore, we consider the joint codeword selection for the strategy without the PA feedback and consider the independent codeword selection for the strategy with the PA feedback.|$|R

3000|$|In this paper, we {{investigated}} {{what should be}} fed back in per‐cell codebook‐based <b>limited</b> feedback <b>CoMP</b> systems to facilitate the coherent downlink cooperative transmission. We first presented a conservative CQI estimation method aiming at reducing the outage probability. To estimate the CQI at the CU, the global CDI and the corresponding quantization accuracy, the global channel norm, and the noise and inter‐cluster interference variance need to be fed back. Considering that both the global channel norm and the global CDI reconstruction depend on the per‐cell channel norms, we analyzed if these norms need to be fed back by deriving the average quantization performance of the global channel norm and the asymptotic weighting factors in the global CDI with and without the per‐cell channel norms. To show if the PA feedback is necessary, we derived the approximated average quantization accuracy of the reconstructed global CDI using the joint codeword selection without PA feedback and the independent codeword selection with PA feedback. We used simulation and numerical results to evaluate {{the accuracy of the}} approximations and show that the conclusions drawn from the average quantization accuracy are also true for the average per‐user data rate. The following observations were obtained from the analytical and simulation results: (1) the per‐cell instantaneous channel norms are unnecessary to be fed back; (2) the global quantization accuracy and the global channel norm need to be fed back, which respectively require 4 and 3 bits for the typical setting of N [...]...|$|R
40|$|Mobile {{networks}} are expected provide consistent quality of experience across the service area. Yet, intercell interference {{is one of}} the main causes for the inconsistent user experience in contemporary mobile systems especially when the universal reuse of spectrum is applied. To mitigate and/or even exploit the intercell interference, coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission/reception has been considered as a promising technique and it is incorporated in the fourth generation mobile standard. Various CoMP techniques have been investigated in literature and practice, each offering differing trade-offs between performance and implementation requirements. Thus, effective use of various CoMP realizations requires thorough understanding of the mentioned trade-offs associated with each CoMP technique.  The contribution of this thesis includes practical approaches for development of effective CoMP transmission methods. Dissertation investigates the methods from three perspectives, namely: by proposing a flexible and practical hierarchical feedback structure to effectively combine different beamforming techniques in CoMP transmission; by studying the performance degradation of CoMP systems due to channel power imbalance in practical <b>CoMP</b> methods with <b>limited</b> feedback; and by evaluating CoMP performance gains in realistic urban deployment scenarios using deterministic 3 D propagation models.  Performance results reveal that in addition to implementation flexibility, notable performance gain can be achieved by simple <b>limited</b> feedback <b>CoMP</b> methods. Our results also demonstrate that the use of amplitude feedback – fast or slow – is important to effectively compensate the impact of channel power imbalance. Furthermore, our results show that CoMP may significantly relax the capacity gap between backhaul and access links of self-backhauled low power nodes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the nature of}} “islands ” in wh (long-distance dependency) constructions, as in (1). (1) *Which word processor {{did you hear the}} rumor that Bill Gates uses? The literature on islands can be basically split into two groups: those that provide a syntactic explanation and those that provide a pragmatic explanation. The standard LFG account of the ill-formedness of (1), due to Kaplan and Zaenen (1989), traces it to constraints on the path between the two grammatical functions borne by the wh element: in English, the path is <b>limited</b> to <b>COMP,</b> XCOMP, and OBLθ, but in this case it would have to go through OBJ. This is a purely syntactic approach. It suffers, inter alia, from the weakness of predicting more cross-linguistic variation that there actually is, since each language is free to include any set of grammatical functions on the path. On the other side, it has been observed that the ill-formedness of (1) is not a fact to be viewed in isolation. It is correlated with the inability of the fronted element to be pragmatically prominent in the clause in which it appears. Viewed from this perspective, islands are not arbitrary constraints imposed by the syntax, but rather a consequence of the informational content of sentences (Kuno 1976, 1987, Erteschik-Shir and Lappin 1979, Erteschik-Shir 1997, Van Valin and LaPolla 1997). Under this view, the reason that (1) is ill-formed is that you heard the rumor that Bill Gates uses (it) cannot be construed as being about which word processor. The pragmatic analysis of the CNPC is supported by the observation that changing the sentence {{in order to make a}} pragmatically prominent reading for the fronte...|$|R
30|$|Network {{densification}} using small {{cells is}} emerging as a critical technology to enhance the resource management of next-generation wireless network [1, 2]. However, the received signal quality of cell edge users can be sharply degraded by the transmission of neighboring cells. Thus, the signal-to-noise ratio is badly influenced (particularly near the cell edge), {{as well as the}} downlink capacity of the mobile network. Inter-cell interference (ICI) has been a bottleneck to improve the mobile network capacity and the quality of service (QoS) of the mobile users that located at cell edge [3]. To face this challenge, coordinated multipoint (CoMP) was proposed [4, 5]. Multiple base stations (BSs) are connected and exchange information for cooperation via backhaul links to reduce ICI. And prediction algorithms can be used to estimate the movement of mobile equipment [6, 7]. Techniques enabling coordinated transmission are explored to migrate the inter-cell interference and increase the system capacity [8 – 16]. Spectral efficiency (SE)-oriented CoMP techniques have been investigated [8 – 10]. In [8, 9], CoMP precoders have been explored to improve the spectral efficiency and network capacity. And both spectral efficiency and fairness were considered in CoMP systems [10]. Besides, energy efficiency (EE)-oriented CoMP techniques have also been studied [11 – 14]. In CoMP-enabled mobile network, the authors investigated the downlink transmit power optimization problem with QoS constraint and limited cell coordination (max-min EE for CoMP systems) [11]. Considering the individual data rate requirement and transmit power of each BS, energy-efficient CoMP precoding was proposed [12]. And EE-oriented resource allocation algorithm was also proposed in CoMP-enabled heterogeneous network, considering of the backhaul power consumption [13]. Semi-smart antenna-based coordinated multipoint technique has been studied to reduce the transmit power of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDMA) networks [14]. Furthermore, the methods to acquire channel state information were discussed in [5]. <b>Limited</b> feedback <b>CoMP</b> system was reviewed in [15]. Moreover, in [16], the authors took the non-ideal backhaul into consideration, and the spectrum allocation scheme was proposed in heterogeneous network for coordinated multipoint transmission. And cooperation between base stations in the downlink of heterogeneous network has been studied [17]. In [18], CoMP downlink transmission design for cloud radio access network (C-RAN) was studied.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates {{variation and}} change in Old English word order from the ninth century {{to the beginning of}} the twelfth century, with special emphasis on the position of the verb. It is demonstrated that variation in surface word order is primarily a reflex of synchronic variation in underlying phrase structure. ^ A structural analysis of Old English syntax is presented, and it is argued that variation in the surface position of the inflected verb is best explained by the hypothesis of alternating INFL-medial and INFL-final phrase structure, with obligatory transformational movement of the verb to INFL. This variation in underlying structure exists not only at the level of the speech community, but also within the usage of individuals. It is shown that in the general case, the verb-second phenomenon in Old English reflects verb movement to clause-medial INFL in both matrix and subordinate clauses, rather than verb movement to <b>COMP</b> <b>limited</b> to matrix clauses, as in Modern German and Dutch. In addition, evidence is provided for alternating OV and VO phrase structure during the Old English period. Verb movement to INFL, together with processes of postposition, syntactic cliticization of both pronouns and adverbs, verb (projection) raising, and further verb movement from INFL to COMP in a restricted set of exceptional matrix clause types, derives the attested word order patterns of Old English. The results of a quantitative study of the underlying position of INFL demonstrate that the frequency of INFL-medial phrase structure increases during the Old English period at the same rate in both matrix and subordinate clauses, supporting the hypothesis of identical structures and processes in the two clause types. Finally, the above analysis of Old English is used as a basis for suggesting the nature of the syntactic changes that occur during the Middle English period. ...|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} viruses which in nature predominantly attack Cruciferae are: turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), cauliflower mosaic virus (CIMV), radish mosaic virus (RaMV), turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV), turnip crinkle virus (TCV), and turnip rosette virus (TRosV). Some {{of them are}} spread in many countries while the others were found in limited areas. TuMV has been detected in 7 or 8 European countries (Klinkowski 1968, Vukovits 1956, Blaszczak 1968), {{and also in the}} USA, Japan and China as well as in some other countries (Yoshii 1963); recently, it has been found in British Columbia (Stace-Smith and Jacoli 1967). CIMV is also widespread in Europe where it was observed in 13 countries (Klinkowski 1968; Kovacevski 1968, Giunchedi 1968); it is also known to exist in the USA (Tompkins 1937), New Zealand and Australia (Randles and Crowley 1967). Finding places of TYMV are apparently <b>limited</b> to Europe (<b>comp.</b> Matthews and Ralph 1966); this virus was first found in Scotland (Markham and Smith 1966); and later in 5 other countries in continental Europe. TCV was reported from Great Britain and India and TRosV only from Scotland (Hollings and Stone 1969; comp. Broadbent and Heathcote 1958). RaMV has been so far detected in the USA and Japan (Campbell and Tochihara 1969). Recently, Stefanac and Mamula (1971) found RaMV in Europe. From the six above mentioned crucifer viruses the following four have been repeatedly found in Yugoslavia up to now: TuMV (Stefanac-Uđbinac et al. 1963), CIMV (Mamula and Milicic 1968; comp. Panj an and Prpic 1954), TYMV (Mamula et al. 1966) and RaMV (Stefanac and Mamula 1971). In order to obtain some evidence of the distribution of these viruses we have investigated them in many places of Yugoslavia, especially {{in the western part of}} the country (Fig. 1, Table 1 a. 2). On the basis of distribution analysis we have established that the mentioned viruses are rather spread in Yugoslavia. The finding places of the viruses are denser in those parts of the country where they were investigated more intensively (Fig. 1). We have particularly closely investigated these viruses on turnip plants (Brassica rapa var. rapifera). Observations on the frequency of the viruses inside turnip fields were made during three years in Tuhelj and Ivancc near Zagreb and they are presented in Table 2. The most frequent virus was RaMV, the second in order of frequency being TYMV. CIMV and TuMV were not found so often. Mixed infections with all of these viruses were detected in very low percentage. In several fields near Ivanec turnip was infected only with RaMV (Table 2). In some localities (Tuhelj) the viruses were found repeatedly for several years. During the autumn 1969 we visited southern Austria and established that TYMV and RaMV were rather spread in turnip fields (Fig. 1). Identification of virus isolates was carried out by means of the following methods: 1. Observation of symptoms in field, 2. Analysis of intracellular changes, 3. Testing of isolates by serological method, 4. Investigation by means of test plants. At least two of these methods were used for the identification of each isolate (Table 1). On the basis of characteristic symptoms on field plants, especially on turnip, it is sometimes possible to identify crucifer viruses. In this plant TYMV produces outstanding variegation and mosaic with yellow, sometimes nearly white areas on leaves which are rarely deformed (Markham and Smith 1949). Field plants infected with RaMV mostly show necrosis on the whole leaf, specially on the midrib and the pedicie (Fig. 2 a). Besides, they often have mosaic and chlorotic as well as necrotic rings and lines on leaf blades (Campbell 1964, Stefanac and Mamula 1971). Turnip plants affected by TuMV often exhibit mosaic and variegation, but the difference between the brighter and the darker areas of the leaf is not so remarkable as in the case of TYMV. Turnips attacked by C 1 MV show vein-banding, assymetrical leaves with laterally curved midribs and often get appearance of stunted rosette (Tompkins 1937, Mamula and Milicic 1968; comp. Broadbent 1957). C 1 MV infected plants often have well expressed vein-clearing on leaves as the first sign of infection; this symptom also appears in TuMV and TYMV infections and is particularly conspicuous in the latter. It is, however, absent from plants infected with RaMV. Only in TYMV infections stunting of plants is a symptom which is not often very expressive. Identification on the basis of symptoms in turnip plants can be done with a fairly high degree of certainty in the case of TYMV and RaMV, and somewhat less sure concerning TuMV and C 1 MV infections. In the cells of their hosts crucifer viruses induce characteristic intracellular inclusion bodies and also some other changes, especially in plastids (Fig. 3 a), which can be very helpful in their identification. Inclusions of TuMV, C 1 MV and TYMV have already been minutely studied and described (Rubio 1956, Milicic and Stefanac 1967, Milicic et al. 1969). Plants infected with RaMV also contain very specific inclusions (Stefanac and Ljubesic 1971, Stefanac and Mamula 1971). They are usually fairly big, specially in relation to inclusions of TuMV, TYMV and CIMV. In inclusions of RaMV, which sometimes contain distinct granula, one, or often more, fairly large vacuoles are mostly present (Fig. 3 b). Conspicuous intracellular changes have been noticed in turnip, white mustard, charlock, Chinese tabbage, Sisymbrium officinale and some other plants, whereas they are not so distinct in some varieties of Brassica oleracea. It would be useful to investigate inclusion bodies in B. oleracea varieties in more detail. Nevertheless, despite the difficulty in working with this species, the method of cell inclusions can be very useful for identification of crucifer viruses. The knowledge of intracellular changes has helped us very much in rapid identification of numerous isolates of all investigated viruses. This was especially the case in TYMV and RaMV infections, because intracellular alterations which arise under the influence of these viruses are very conspicuous (Fig. 3 a, b) ...|$|R
