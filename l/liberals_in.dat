5|$|Boortz's {{first book}} was The Commencement Speech You Need To Hear in 1997, {{followed}} by The Terrible Truth About <b>Liberals,</b> <b>in</b> 1998. In 2005, he co-wrote The FairTax Book with Congressman John Linder, proposing {{to implement a}} variant of a national retail sales tax in lieu of other federal taxes. Boortz's involvement with the FairTax is covered in the documentary film An Inconvenient Tax.|$|E
5|$|Domnitor Cuza was {{ultimately}} ousted by {{a coalition of}} Conservatives and <b>Liberals</b> <b>in</b> February 1866; following a period of transition and maneuvers to avert international objections, a perpetually unified Principality of Romania was established under Carol of Hohenzollern, with the adoption of the 1866 Constitution. Two years later, in recognition of his scholarly contributions, Kogălniceanu {{became a member of the}} newly created Romanian Academy Historical Section.|$|E
5|$|In 1832 the Tory Party {{evolved into}} the Conservative Party and in 1859 the Whig Party evolved, with Radicals and Peelites, into the Liberal Party. In {{opposition}} to Irish home rule, the Liberal Unionists ceded from the <b>Liberals</b> <b>in</b> 1886, aligning themselves with the Conservatives. The Labour Party was later founded, as the Labour Representation Committee, in 1900.|$|E

50|$|Francis Wrigley Hirst (10 June 1873 - 22 February 1953) was a British journalist, {{writer and}} editor of The Economist magazine. He was a <b>Liberal</b> <b>in</b> party terms and a {{classical}} <b>liberal</b> <b>in</b> ideology.|$|R

5|$|Kogălniceanu joined other National <b>Liberals</b> <b>in</b> expressing {{opposition}} to the trade convention Catargiu had signed with Austria-Hungary, which was advantageous to the latter's exports, and which, they claimed, was leading Romanian industry to ruin. He accepted it while in office, but looked into adopting European-like patent laws, {{as a measure of}} encouraging local industries. A National Liberal government would repeal the agreement in 1886.|$|E
5|$|His {{father had}} been a {{supporter}} of the Liberal Party, and Birkett had helped campaign for them during the 1906 general election. He had been invited to become the Liberal candidate for Cambridge in 1911, but he refused because he had no income; he did, however, help his employer George Cadbury, Jr. get elected as a Liberal Councillor in Birmingham and helped start a branch of the National League of Young <b>Liberals</b> <b>in</b> the city.|$|E
5|$|Mason {{became the}} first Liberal to be elected {{councillor}} for Ashton-under-Lyne in 1856. He was mayor of the council from 1857 to 1860 and retired from local politics in 1874 due to conflict with his own party. Mason returned to the <b>Liberals</b> <b>in</b> 1878 when he stood for election as Member of Parliament for Ashton-under-Lyne. He was voted in and supported progressive policies, which included women's suffrage, making him unpopular within his own party. He was MP from 1880 to 1885. When he died in 1886, aged 69, Hugh Mason had amassed £290,933 (now about £17million).|$|E

5000|$|Moorabbin MLA Bob Suggett {{had been}} re-elected as an Independent <b>Liberal</b> <b>in</b> 1961 after losing Liberal {{preselection}} before that election. He was readmitted to the <b>Liberal</b> Party <b>in</b> 1964.|$|R
5000|$|Perhaps {{his most}} famous legacy is from RFC 760, which {{includes}} a robustness principle often called Postel's law: [...] "an implementation should be conservative in its sending behavior, and <b>liberal</b> <b>in</b> its receiving behavior" [...] (reworded in RFC 1122 as [...] "Be <b>liberal</b> <b>in</b> what you accept, and conservative in what you send").|$|R
5|$|The {{period of}} Dutch rule saw growing hostility between the Catholic Belgian provinces and the {{predominantly}} Protestant Dutch. The Belgian provinces also {{complained that they}} were underrepresented by the Kingdom's system of government, where 55 Belgian deputies were allocated to represent 3.5million people, while {{an equal number of}} Dutch deputies represented just two million. When the States-General voted against adopting the new unrepresentative constitution, William declared that the minority favorable vote outweighed the negative vote. <b>Liberals</b> <b>in</b> Belgium also accused William of attacking personal and religious freedoms.|$|E
5|$|After {{the control}} of Rupert's Land was passed from Great Britain to the Government of Canada in 1869, Manitoba {{attained}} full-fledged rights and responsibilities of self-government as the first Canadian province {{carved out of the}} Northwest Territories. The Legislative Assembly of Manitoba was established on 14 July 1870. Political parties first emerged between 1878 and 1883, with a two-party system (Liberals and Conservatives). The United Farmers of Manitoba appeared in 1922, and later merged with the <b>Liberals</b> <b>in</b> 1932. Other parties, including the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), appeared during the Great Depression; in the 1950s, Manitoban politics became a three-party system, and the Liberals gradually declined in power. The CCF became the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP), which came to power in 1969. Since then, the Conservatives and the NDP have been the dominant parties.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of 1956, the Tories were led by former Ontario premier George A. Drew, who had been elected PC leader in 1948 over Saskatchewan MP John Diefenbaker. Drew was the fifth man to lead the Tories in their 21 years out of power. None had come close to {{defeating}} the Liberals; the best performance was in 1945, when John Bracken secured 67 seats for the Tories. The Liberals, though, had won 125seats, and maintained their majority. In the 1953 election, the PC party won 51seats out of the 265 in the House of Commons. Subsequently, the Tories picked up two seats from the <b>Liberals</b> <b>in</b> by-elections, and the Liberals (who had won 169seats in 1953) lost an additional seat to the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF, the predecessor of the New Democratic Party (NDP)).|$|E

5|$|Frederick married Victoria, Princess Royal, eldest {{daughter}} of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. The couple were well-matched; their shared liberal ideology {{led them to}} seek greater representation for commoners in the government. Frederick, {{in spite of his}} conservative militaristic family background, had developed liberal tendencies {{as a result of his}} ties with Britain and his studies at the University of Bonn. As the Crown Prince, he often opposed the conservative Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, particularly in speaking out against Bismarck's policy of uniting Germany through force, and in urging that the power of the Chancellorship be curbed. <b>Liberals</b> <b>in</b> both Germany and Britain hoped that as emperor, Frederick III would move to liberalize the German Empire.|$|E
5|$|Immersed in the university's violent gang culture, in 1947 he {{took part}} in a quashed attempt to {{overthrow}} the military junta of Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic. Returning to student politics, Castro was involved with violent demonstrations in which protesters clashed with riot police, at which he became increasingly left-wing in his views. Traveling to Bogotá, Colombia, he fought for the <b>Liberals</b> <b>in</b> the Bogotazo before returning to Havana, where he embraced Marxism. In 1948 he married the wealthy Mirta Díaz Balart, and in September 1949 their son Fidelito was born. Obtaining his Doctorate of Law in September 1950, he co-opened an unsuccessful law firm before entering parliamentary politics as a Partido Ortodoxo candidate. When General Fulgencio Batista launched a coup and overthrew the elected presidency, Castro brought legal challenges against him, but as this proved ineffective, he began to think of other ways to oust Batista.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, Gladstone {{brought forward}} {{legislation}} {{to establish a}} Catholic university in Dublin. This divided the Liberals, and on 12 March an alliance of Conservatives and Irish Catholics defeated the government by three votes. Gladstone resigned, and the Queen sent for Disraeli, who refused to take office. Without a general election, a Conservative government would be another minority, dependent for survival on the division of its opponents. Disraeli wanted the power a majority would bring, and felt he could gain it later by leaving the <b>Liberals</b> <b>in</b> office now. Gladstone's government struggled on, beset by scandal and unimproved by a reshuffle. As part of that change, Gladstone took on the office of Chancellor, leading to questions {{as to whether he}} had to stand for re-election on taking on a second ministry—until the 1920s, MPs becoming ministers, thus taking an office of profit under the Crown, had to seek re-election.|$|E

50|$|Bosworth {{was clearly}} a {{three-way}} marginal at this time. It had been won by a Coalition <b>Liberal</b> <b>in</b> 1918, a Tory <b>in</b> 1922, was <b>Liberal</b> <b>in</b> 1923 and Conservative again in 1924. Although Labour had not yet won the seat, the party consistently polled {{about a third of}} the vote in all these recent contests, coming second in 1922.|$|R
5|$|In 1967, {{and again}} in 1970, Wilton {{recommended}} {{the creation of a}} single Defence Board of Administration, consisting of the Defence Minister, the Defence Secretary, CCOSC, and the three service chiefs, to take over the functions of the Air, Military, and Naval Boards, along with those of their separate ministers. While nothing came of this at the time, Wilton was consulted by the Labor Party prior to its reorganisation of the Defence Department, which it commenced soon after defeating the <b>Liberals</b> <b>in</b> the December 1972 Federal election. The following year, the single-service ministries were abolished in favour of an all-encompassing Department of Defence; by 1984, the CCOSC position had evolved to become the Chief of the Defence Force, directly commanding all three armed services through their respective chiefs.|$|E
5|$|In the Commonwealth context, too, Britain {{knew that}} simply {{granting}} independence to Southern Rhodesia {{was out of}} the question as many of the Afro-Asian countries were also Commonwealth members. Statehood for Salisbury without majority rule would split the Commonwealth and perhaps cause it to break up, a disastrous prospect for British foreign policy. The Commonwealth repeatedly called on Britain to intervene directly should Southern Rhodesian defiance continue, while <b>liberals</b> <b>in</b> Britain worried that if left unchecked Salisbury might drift towards South African-style apartheid. Anxious to avoid having to choose between Southern Rhodesia and the Commonwealth, Whitehall attempted to negotiate a middle way between the two, but ultimately put international considerations first, regarding them as more important.|$|E
5|$|The 19th {{century was}} a {{turbulent}} time for Spain. Those {{in favour of}} reforming Spain's government vied for political power with conservatives, who tried to prevent reforms from taking place. Some <b>liberals,</b> <b>in</b> a tradition that had started with the Spanish Constitution of 1812, sought to limit {{the power of the}} monarchy of Spain and to establish a liberal state. The reforms of 1812 did not last after King Ferdinand VII dissolved the Constitution and ended a short-lived liberal government with French royalist military assistance. Twelve successful coups were carried out between 1814 and 1874. There were several attempts to realign the political system to match social reality. Until the 1850s, the economy of Spain was primarily based on agriculture. There was little development of a bourgeois industrial or commercial class. The land-based oligarchy remained powerful; a small number of people held large estates (called latifundia) as well as all the important government positions. The landowners' power was challenged by the industrial and merchant sectors, largely unsuccessfully.|$|E

5|$|After the {{resignation}} of the last Liberal Cabinet, PedroII invited the rival Conservative Party to form a new cabinet. With his party no longer in control, Paranhos lost much of his influence. The Liberal Party was not willing to accept its loss of power. The most radical faction of the <b>Liberals</b> <b>in</b> the province of Pernambuco, known as the Partido da Praia ("Party of the Beach"), openly advocated a rebellion. Nominally Liberal, the praieiros were associated with the Courtier Faction. The proposed rebellion would be an attempt of this branch of the Courtier Faction to regain control of the government. The praieiros had little support, and public opinion was also against them. The group was unable to convince {{the vast majority of the}} population that a revolt would bring them any benefits. On 2 February 1849, the limited uprising of the praieiros was completely defeated after attacking Recife, the capital of Pernambuco. Even though Paranhos had condemned it, the Praiera rebellion, combined with the downfalls of his patron and the Liberal Party, made a continued political career impossible. He turned his focus once again to his work in journalism.|$|E
5|$|As Liberal leader, Thorpe {{provided}} a clear {{contrast with the}} pedestrian images of Wilson and Edward Heath, the Conservative leader since March 1965. He was considerably younger, and much more telegenic. His first years of leadership were problematic; he found himself {{at odds with the}} Young Liberals, who were advocating policies far {{to the left of the}} Liberal mainstream. Their demands for workers' control in nationalised industries, British withdrawal from NATO, and massive cuts in the defence budget, caused bitter disputes within the party and damaged its public image. At this time the political climate was not conducive to radical policies; the Wilson government's rapid descent into unpopularity brought a sharp swing to the right among voters. The beneficiaries were the Conservatives, who made spectacular by-election gains at Labour's expense while the Liberals failed to make any real impact. Discontent against Thorpe's leadership was being voiced within a year of his election, culminating in June 1968 when disaffected senior party members combined with Young <b>Liberals</b> <b>in</b> an attempt to depose him. Thorpe had just married Caroline Allpass, and was abroad on honeymoon when the plotters struck. The timing of their attempted coup, widely seen in and out of the party as treachery, ensured that on Thorpe's return the party executive backed him by 48 votes to 2.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, {{following}} Prussia's victories, the German {{states were}} united into the German Empire, with William as the Emperor and Frederick as heir-apparent {{to the new}} German monarchy. Although William thought {{the day when he}} became Emperor the saddest of his life, Frederick was excited to be witness to a great day in German history. Bismarck, now Chancellor, disliked Frederick and distrusted the liberal attitudes of the Crown Prince and Princess. Often at odds with his father's and Bismarck's policies and actions, Frederick sided with the country's <b>liberals</b> <b>in</b> their opposition to the expansion of the empire's army. The Crown Prince also became involved in many public works projects, such as the establishment of schools and churches in the area of Bornstedt near Potsdam. To assist his father's effort to turn Berlin, the capital city, into a great cultural centre, he was appointed Protector of Public Museums; it was largely due to Frederick that considerable artistic collections were acquired, housed in Berlin's new Kaiser Friedrich Museum (later known as the Bode Museum) after his death. In 1878, when his father was incapacitated by injury from an assassination attempt, Frederick briefly took over his tasks but was soon relegated to the sidelines once again. His lack of influence affected him deeply, even causing him to think about suicide.|$|E
