500|$|Cherry {{offered the}} role of Bree Van de Kamp, a [...] "perfect homemaker" [...] {{reminiscent}} of The Stepford Wives, to Dana Delany three times. Delany rejected the role, as it was too similar to her character on Pasadena, but would later join the series in its fourth season as Katherine Mayfair. Marcia Cross was later cast as Bree. Roma Downey, Jeri Ryan, and Stacey Travis were also considered for the role, while Nicollette Sheridan auditioned for the part and was cast as neighborhood tramp Edie Britt instead. On her audition, Sheridan recalled, [...] "At {{the end of the}} reading, the director <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'No, no, I see you as Edie.' I said, 'Oh, I see, I come in a housewife and mother of two and leave the slut.'" [...] The Edie character was originally intended to be a small role, but it was expanded once Sheridan was cast. Felicity Huffman was cast as Lynette Scavo, a frustrated stay-at-home mother of four, after talking about her own experiences as a mother during her audition. Cherry called Huffman's casting [...] "very lucky," [...] commenting that [...] "within fifteen minutes she had the part." [...] Alex Kingston read for {{the role of}} Lynette, and has since alleged that she was denied the role for being too heavy. The role of series narrator Mary Alice Young was given to Sheryl Lee. Cross originally auditioned for the role before being cast as Bree instead. Jeanne Tripplehorn and Heather Locklear also auditioned for leading roles.|$|E

A couple of years after that, Sussex were playing against Essex in a Championship game at Chelmsford, when our wicketkeeper, Rupert Webb got injured. There we were in the Chelmsford dressing room before the start of play and we suddenly realised we've got no wicketkeeper. Robin Marlar, the Sussex captain, <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> [...] "You're doing it". I didn't have any kit and so had to borrow Essex keeper Brian Taylor's gloves." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hoppus married Skye Everly on December 2, 2000. Hoppus met Everly at a {{rehearsal}} {{for the music}} video of [...] "All the Small Things". According to a 2004 interview, Everly, who was then an MTV talent executive, initially refused to date Hoppus: [...] "Tom [...] always used to embarrass me. Any girl he'd talk to, he'd say, 'Hey, you wanna go {{on a date with}} Mark?' He asked Skye, my wife, who <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> 'No.' That's how it all started." [...] Two years after marrying Hoppus, Everly gave birth to a son in 2002.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Peter Farrelly and {{producer}} John Penotti took their pitch—along with about 60 scripts for the vignettes—to Relativity Media. At that meeting, Wessler, Penotti, and Farrelly presented one short that {{they already had}} shot, starring Kate Winslet as a woman going {{on a blind date}} with a seemingly successful and handsome Hugh Jackman. [...] "They just <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Go for it,'" [...] Wessler told The Hollywood Reporter. [...] "It takes a lot of balls to make something that is not conventional." [...] Relativity provided $6 million for the film, but no other studio would sign on. [...] "Other potential backers", Farrelly revealed, [...] "didn't believe it could happen—a movie with Kate Winslet for $6 million?" ...|$|E
2500|$|As a {{footnote}} to this event, many years later, I ran across Lt. Comdr. Carpenter (by that time Admiral Carpenter) at a Helena reunion and he filled in some details that I hadn't known. We were seated {{across from each}} other at a dinner table. We were all telling sea stories and I started telling them my story (I had forgotten that it was Commander Carpenter who had issued the orders to the wheel). Right {{in the middle of my}} story Carpenter <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "And do you know who issued those orders?" [...] When I admitted that I didn't remember, but wished that I could, he replies, [...] "I did." [...] The minute he said that, I remembered.|$|E

2500|$|Recalling his {{involvement}} with Foyt, Hutcherson said that [...] "A.J. had bought a Camaro to run USAC stock cars and we were running at Texas World Speedway at College Station. He had gotten mad about what some reporters had written {{about him in the}} days before the race. Well he sat on the pole and was leading the race when he pulled in with just a couple laps to go. I leaned in the car and asked him what was wrong and he said, 'Overheating.' I looked at the gauges which were normal and said, 'Why'd you pull out?' He <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'I didn't want to talk to those reporters in Victory Circle.' We had the race won and he parked the damn car!" ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Amy Lee, {{the song}} has several meanings, the first being an {{incident}} at a restaurant. During an interview from a tour stop in Tulsa she told The Boston Phoenix: [...] "I {{was inspired to}} write it when someone said something to me— I didn’t know him, and I {{thought he might be}} clairvoyant. I was in a relationship and I was completely unhappy. But I was hiding it. I was being completely abused and I was trying to cover it up; I wouldn’t even admit it to myself. So then I had spoken maybe 10 or 15 words to this guy, who was a friend of a friend. We were waiting for everyone else to show up, and we went into a restaurant and got a table. And he <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> ‘Are you happy?’ And I felt my heart leap, and I was like, he totally knows what I’m thinking. And I lied, I said I was fine. Anyway, he's not really clairvoyant. But he is a sociology major." [...] Lee said in a VH1 interview: [...] "Open-mindedness. It's about waking up to all the things you've been missing for so long. One day someone said something that made my heart race for a second and I realized that for months I'd been numb, just going through the motions of life." [...] During an interview with Blender, Lee claimed that she wrote [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] about her longtime friend, Josh Hartzler, whom she married in 2007.|$|E

6000|$|... "Twas {{in truth}} my fault, captain," [...] I cried out. The captain <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> nothing. After that the butcher made bold {{to take up}} his man's defence.|$|E

6000|$|She laughed; then {{suddenly}} became frightened and serious; then <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "It was dreadfully like business;" [...] and then entreated Morgan {{not to stare}} at her, or, in {{the present state of}} her nerves, she should upset the punch-bowl.

6000|$|... "Why not now?" [...] I asked. [...] "It may do some good. We may {{arrive at}} some decision."

6000|$|Mr. St. John came but once: he <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> {{my state}} of {{lethargy}} {{was the result}} of reaction from excessive and protracted fatigue. He pronounced it needless to send for a doctor: nature, he was sure, would manage best, left to herself. He said every nerve had been overstrained in some way, and the whole system must sleep torpid a while. There was no disease. He imagined my recovery would be rapid enough when once commenced. These opinions he delivered in a few words, in a quiet, low voice; and added, after a pause, in the tone of a man little accustomed to expansive comment, [...] "Rather an unusual physiognomy; certainly, not indicative of vulgarity or degradation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If any one in Harvie recalls me now, {{it is as}} a hobbledehoy who strode {{along the}} cliffs, {{shouting}} Homer at the sea-mews. With all my learning, I, who gave Margaret the name of Lalage, understood women less than any fisherman who bandied words with them across a boat. I remember a Yule night when both Adam and I were at her mother's cottage, and, as we were leaving, he had the audacity to kiss Margaret. She {{ran out of the}} room, and Adam swaggered off, and when I recovered from my horror, I apologized for what he had done. I shall never forget how her mother <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'Ay, Gavin, I see they dinna teach everything at Aberdeen.' You will not believe it, but I walked away doubting her meaning. I thought more of scholarship then than I do now. Adam Dishart taught me its proper place.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Louis!" [...] she said, [...] "I have a {{confession}} to make, and I must beg {{you to hear}} it patiently to the end. You must know that our good Lomaque, though he came in tired from his walk, occupied himself the first thing, at my request, in writing the letter which is to secure to us our dear old home by {{the banks of the}} Seine. When he had done, he <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'I should like to be present at your happy return to the house where I first saw you.' 'Oh, come, come with us!' I said directly. 'I am not an independent man,' he answered; 'I have a margin of time allowed me at Paris, certainly, but it is not long--if I were only my own master--' and then he stopped. Louis, I remembered all we owed to him; I remembered that there was no sacrifice we ought not to be too glad to make for his sake; I felt the kindness of the wish he had expressed; and perhaps I was a little influenced by my own impatience to see once more my flower-garden and the rooms where we used to be so happy. So I said to him, 'I am sure Louis will agree with me that our time is yours, and that we shall be only too glad to advance our departure so as to make traveling leisure enough for you to come with us to Rouen. We should be worse than ungrateful--' He stopped me. 'You have always been good to me,' he said. 'I must not impose on your kindness now. No, no, you have formalities to settle before you can leave this place.' 'Not one,' I said--for we have not, as you know, Louis? 'Why, here is your furniture to begin with,' he said. 'A few chairs and tables hired from the inn,' I answered; 'we have only to give the landlady our key, to leave a letter for the owner of the cottage, and then--' He laughed. 'Why, to hear you talk, one would think you were as ready to travel as I am!' 'So we are,' I said, 'quite as ready, living in the way we do here.' He shook his head; but you will not shake yours, Louis, I am sure, now you have heard all my long story? You can't blame me can you?" ...|$|E
