40|$|ABSTRACT: It is {{of extreme}} {{importance}} for an analysis {{with a high}} degree of accuracy that characteristics of rock around cavern such a tunnel are well known. A new method of rock property investigation by using a compact vertical seismic prospecting system is proposed. This investigation system consists of a probe attached vibration sensor and super elastic alloy plate to tress it against borehole surface, computer, and trigger system. of cavern walls by excavation, the relative displacement of rock from the point where rock does not move, the earth pressure that acts on the lining and the force acted on rock bolts. These measurements gradually change influenced by the release of the earth pressure that an excavated rock has been under. It is a foregone conclusion that the changes in measurements of a <b>loosened</b> <b>zone</b> damaged by excavation are the greatest. There are other indicators to evaluate characteristics of rock. one of them is the velocity of elastic wave...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{integrated}} {{geophysical survey}} using both the electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) methods was undertaken over a cave of great archaeological interest in southern Italy. The survey {{was performed to}} assess {{the stability of the}} carbonate rock roof of the cave. A geophysical survey was preferred to boreholes and geotechnical tests, {{in order to avoid the}} risk of mass movements. The interpretation of integrated data from ERT and GPR resulted in an evaluation of some of the electromagnetic (EM) characteristics (such as the EM wave velocity) and the detection of discontinuities (fractures) in the carbonate rock. It is well known that rock fractures constitute a serious problem in cave maintenance, and progressive cracking within the bed rock is considered to be one of the main causes of collapse. An analysis of the back-scattered energy was also required for the GPR data interpretation. Cracks within the bedrock were detected to a depth of about 2 m by using GPR, which allowed for the identification of the <b>loosened</b> <b>zone</b> around the cave...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Producers in the Coastal Plain of {{the southeastern}} United States manage soil {{compaction}} in conservation tillage systems by in‐row subsoiling prior to planting. However, planting directly over the <b>loosened</b> <b>zone</b> of soil can be difficult in high‐residue conservation tillage systems where cover crop production is maximized, because the loosened soil is often covered by the large amounts of cover crop residue. Tractors equipped with guidance systems could assist with placement of in‐row subsoiling and planting operations, but {{little is known about}} the accuracy necessary to maximize rooting development, reduce succeeding soil compaction, and optimize crop yield. An experiment was conducted in south‐central Alabama to determine the maximum distance in‐row subsoiling performed by three different implements could be from the cotton row without reducing cotton growth and increasing soil compaction. Results showed that if the cotton row was within 5. 1 cm of in‐row subsoiling, the relative seed cotton yield is 44 % greater than a corresponding no‐subsoiling treatment. No significant differences were found between the three in‐row subsoiling implements used in the experiment. Recommendations resulting from this experiment indicate that to maximize crop yields and minimize soil compaction in the row, the subsoiled zone should be kept within 5 cm of the row...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the development of}} the NSWS (Nippon Screw Weight System) testing machine. In compliance with the Swedish sounding (SWS) test that determines loading and rotational penetration resistance. The NSWS was developed as an in-situ ground surveying device to detect super soft zones in the ground, including hollows and loosening, in detail, by allowing operation in the 0 to 2500 N load range, with very close measurements intervals and penetration speed control, the features of which cannot be achieved by the SWS testing machine. Additionally, findings from an in-situ surveying of in-ground hollows identified using the NSWS testing machine are reported in this paper. The machine achieved a conversion N-value measuring intervals of 2. 5 cm (or 3. 8 cm), determination of ranges of hollow and <b>loosening</b> <b>zones</b> through pre-setting of penetration speed, and detection of super soft zones of conversion N-values 1 and below with a load range of 0 to 1000 N...|$|R

40|$|We {{developed}} a new method the air tracer test to investigate the persistence of open cracks and loosening of rock mass slope. In this method, we use smoke, hot air, and/or specific gas as tracers injecting them into open cracks directly or using a specific double packer settled in a borehole. Observation and confirmation of the outflow of the tracer is performed by naked eye for the rock surface, and by a borehole TV, gas sensors, or thermosensors settled in another borehole for rock interior. We applied the method to several rock slopes in which various type of open cracks exist, and demonstrated that the air tracer could move through open cracks from under 1 mm to over 1 m in width. The smoke tracer was particularly detectable even after having moved about 100 m. The method can clarify not only persistent open cracks and <b>loosened</b> <b>zones</b> but also the loosening mechanism such as toppling, sliding, etc. The air tracer test should become a useful method for selecting appropriate countermeasures for unstable rock slopes...|$|R

40|$|The {{emergency}} {{condition of the}} mine surface facilities including a coal wash plant, a crusher, a bunker and three galleries, is considered. As {{a result of a}} complex of engineering-geological and geophysical surveys, it is established that the significant deformations of the foundations of the structure are caused by the zones of weakened (unconsolidated) soil in the bases of the foundations formed due to landslide developments in the bulk ground mass. The article describes the techniques for justifying the technological parameters of the consolidation grouting of soil bases including computer modeling, forecasting of deformations of the natural and consolidated ground mass, analysis of the stress-strain state of soils in the most dangerous area. The effectiveness of the adopted scheme of consolidation grouting of soil bases according to the approved methodology for elimination of the {{emergency condition}} of the mine surface facility was confirmed. The limit values of the calculated horizontal deformations in the soil bases of one of the supports of the galleries are determined.

40|$|It {{is clear}} that no-fly zone of the {{airplane}} during a volcanic eruption has the great influence on the economic activity of the area, based on the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull in Iceland. When existence of volcanic ash clouds is estimated {{as a result of}} prediction calculation, it becomes impossible to fly the airspace. However, during the volcanic eruption of Iceland, European aviation authorities took the measure which <b>loosens</b> no-fly <b>zone</b> of an airplane according to the concentration of volcanic ash in order to avoid confusion of an air route at an early stage. In that case, the diffusion of volcanic ash clouds grasps viewing or a satellite photograph, and the concentration of volcanic ash is measured by LIDAR (detection by a laser picture) and the dust meter in the light airplane. This research firstly aims at grasping the three-dimensional structure of volcanic ash plume by the in-situ airborne ash measurement. The atmospheric diffusion model which predicts the volcanic ash concentration is verified by the comparison between observed and calculated values. The in-situ field is Mt. Sakurajima in Kagoshima where the eruption frequency is high. By the X band MP radar which the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism installed in Tarumizu City, the distribution and shade of the air-borne volcanic ashes by the eruption of Sakurajima was measured. However, the physical evaluation of the measurement value was considered to be needed, and the possibility of the practical usage of X band MP radar was also investigated...|$|R
30|$|Early {{fixation}} of the tibial component after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) {{is crucial}} for long-term survival of the implant [1, 2]. In uncemented TKA the bone ingrowth into the porous coated surface of the implant is inhibited by a motion-induced fibrous membrane between the bone and the implant surface. Bioactive coating of the implant surface with hydroxyapatite (HA) converts this fibrous membrane to bony anchorage across the surface gaps of the implant [3 – 6]. It has been a challenge to science to predict the long-term outcome of TKA. DEXA-studies of bone mineral density (BMD) adjacent to the TKA-implant is a valuable tool in detecting stress-shielding and the attendant risk of fractures, but {{do not seem to}} be a convincing tool in considering long-term stability of implants [7]. A study on differences in BMD between HA-coated and non-HA coated tibial implants have also been carried out and no significant differences were found [8]. Conventional X-ray examinations after TKA are a valuable tool in estimating two-dimensional orientation of the implant. Furthermore X-ray examinations sometimes can be a supportive option when considering aseptic <b>loosening</b> (clearing up <b>zones)</b> of the implant. However, X-ray examinations used as a predictive tool for estimating long-term survival due to fixation of the implant are also of limited value. In 1974, Selvik developed Roentgensterogrammetric Analysis (RSA), a method for quantifying the fixation of an implant with high precision and accuracy by estimating three-dimensional (3 D) movements (migrations) over time [9 – 11]. Since then more than 300 scientific papers dealing with the subject RSA have been published. Several studies have found RSA as a valuable method of predicting long-term aseptic loosening of implants after TKA [1, 2, 9 – 11]. However, some major problems due to differences in the technical procedures, terminology and presentation of data among several RSA-studies have been pointed out [12]. These differences between studies make it sometimes difficult to compare data from one study to another. To overcome these problems in the future six international research centers recently agreed upon new standards for terminology, description and use of RSA arrangement. The new standards are preliminary presented as “guidelines” by Valstar et al. in 2005 [12] and will form the basis of a later standardization protocol. Our study is widely based on these new guidelines and, when relevant, items in standardization of RSA of special importance to the reader of this article will be focused on.|$|R
