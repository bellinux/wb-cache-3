5|$|As {{the crew}} began {{to prepare for}} arrival at Sioux City, they {{questioned}} whether they should deploy the <b>landing</b> gear or belly-land the aircraft with the gear retracted. They decided that having the <b>landing</b> gear down would provide some shock absorption on impact. The complete hydraulic failure left the <b>landing</b> gear lowering mechanism inoperative. Two options were available to the flight crew. The DC-10 is designed such that if hydraulic pressure to the <b>landing</b> gear is lost, the gear will fall down slightly and rest on the <b>landing</b> gear doors. Placing the regular <b>landing</b> gear handle in the down position will unlock the doors mechanically, and the doors and <b>landing</b> gear will then fall down into place and lock due to gravity. An alternative system is also available using a lever in the cockpit floor to cause the <b>landing</b> gear to fall into position. This lever has {{the added benefit of}} unlocking the outboard ailerons, which are not used in high-speed flight and are locked in a neutral position. The crew hoped that there might be some trapped hydraulic fluid in the outboard ailerons and that they might regain some use of flight controls by unlocking them. They elected to extend the gear with the alternative system. Although the gear deployed successfully, there was no change in the controllability of the aircraft.|$|E

To improve this situation, {{it is necessary to}} slow the increasing rate of built-up <b>land</b> and even reduce the existing built-up <b>land</b> by improving <b>land</b> use efficiency.

To address these issues, we developed a model named “current-plan-requirement response (CPRR) ”, to optimize the <b>land</b> quotas. With this model, we investigated the current status of <b>land</b> use, the process of <b>land</b> use planning, and the requirements of <b>land</b> use planning with urban sprawl deceleration in Shanghai.
