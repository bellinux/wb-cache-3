25|$|The G35 sedan {{underwent}} a major revision for the 2007 model year. This 2nd generation front-mid (FM) platform underpinning the new G is shared {{in part with}} the Infiniti M and has several structural reinforcements around the engine and rear floor area, along with three times more laser welding and 16 percent more spot welds than the old version; overall body stiffness was improved by 40 percent.

A heavy-duty suspension option was available for V8 powered cars, and included extra-heavy-duty springs and shocks. Steering was recirculating ball system, with power steering optional.

500|$|The CCDI was cumbersome; twenty-seven {{separate}} procedures had to {{be completed}} before an official could be placed under investigation. Other problems were institutional; for example, the commission had no organisation below the provincial level. In response to the CCDI's failures, the 1955 National Conference established the CCC. Delegates noted that the CCDI's problems were its lack of independence from party committees {{and the lack of}} meaningful collaboration between a control commission at one level and those at higher levels. The institutional balance favouring party committees led some (such as Gao Gang and Rao Shushi) to pack local commissions for discipline inspection (CDI) with loyalists who had no interest in carrying out their responsibilities. The control commissions had the power to appeal committee decisions, and were required to report their work to the higher-level control commission. Unlike the CCDI, the CCC had an organisation below the provincial level. It was empowered to [...] "examine, approve, and change decisions by <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> committees", was required to verify the composition of control committees at the provincial level and below and had the power to investigate unreliable elements at will.

40|$|Microgrid is an {{emerging}} {{technology in the}} eld of electrical engineering which employs the concept of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) in order to generate electricity in a small sized power system. The main objectives of this dissertation are to: 1 - design a new <b>control</b> for <b>lower</b> level <b>control</b> of DERs in microgrids, 2 - implement distributed upper level control for DERs in microgrids and 3 - apply analytical approaches in order to analyze DERs in microgrids. The control in each DER {{can be divided into}} two main categories: lower and upper level. <b>Lower</b> level <b>control</b> is the main objective of control in each DER. For example, the <b>lower</b> level <b>control</b> in Photovoltaic (PV) is in charge of transferring the maximum power from sun into the main grid. Unlike the <b>lower</b> level <b>control,</b> the upper level control is an additional control loop on top of the <b>lower</b> level <b>controls.</b> For example, Voltage/Frequency (VF) controllers are installed on top of Active/Reactive (PQ) power controller in energy storage devices as upper level control. In this dissertation, for the <b>lower</b> level <b>control</b> improvements, two widely used DERs are selected (PV, and oshore wind farm) and new control algorithms are developed in order to improve the performance of lower level controllers in these DERs. For the PV lower level improvement, a new control methodology is proposed in order to minimize the maximum power tracking error in PV lower level controller. Second contribution in <b>lower</b> level <b>control</b> is for the oshore wind farm applications based on Multi-Terminal High Voltage Direct Current (MTDC) transmission; a new control is designed in order to minimize the losses in transmission lines through <b>lower</b> level <b>control</b> of High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) converters. For the upper level control, this dissertation considers the energy storage as another mostly used type of DER in microgrids. The <b>lower</b> level <b>control</b> for energy storage is in charge of controlling the PQ of the energy storage. The main contribution in the upper level control is to implement the distributed control algorithm based on consensus theory for battery energy storages in order to maximize the efficiency, energy management as well as synchronizing the performance of parallel energy storage devices in microgrids. In this case, the consensus based distributed control algorithm with limited information exchange between neighboring energy storage units is proposed and implemented to validate the claim. The third contribution of this research is to apply advanced analysis techniques to evaluate the performance of the DERs in microgrids. Two approaches are introduced for microgrid modeling in this research. Firstly, an impedance modeling technique is used to model the oshore wind farm connected to the main AC grid through HVDC transmission line. Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) Nyquist analysis and singular value analysis are used to assess the interactions between HVDC converter and grid. Secondly, an unbalanced microgrid is considered and Dynamic Phasor (DP) analysis is applied in order to nd the stability limitations under different scenarios. This dissertation has led to seven journal papers (five published, one journal in revision process and one journal submitted recently) and four conference papers...|$|R

2500|$|The Mustang has a MacPherson-strut front {{suspension}} with reverse [...] "L" [...] <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> arms. The {{rear suspension}} {{was a new}} three-link system with a Panhard Rod that controls the vertical and lateral movements of the axle. This live axle rear suspension, while sacrificing handling, provides the benefits of reduced cost and weight over heavier, more expensive independent rear suspensions. In spite of this, Ford has drawn heavy criticism from the automotive journalism community for the decision to equip the 5th generation Mustang with the live axle system. At a press conference, Ford stated that to include an independent rear suspension would have added $5,000 to the showroom price of the car.|$|E
2500|$|The {{biggest change}} for the Torino was the switch to body-on-frame {{construction}} from the unit-construction of the 1971 models.

It featured an energy absorbing [...] "S" [...] shaped front end, torque boxes to isolate road shock, fourteen rubber body mounts and five solid cross members. The front suspension used an unequal length control arm design, with a computer selected coil spring mounted on the strut stabilized <b>lower</b> <b>control</b> arm, much like the fullsize Ford LTD. The rear used the [...] "Stabul" [...] four link suspension with a computer selected coil spring mounted on a solid axle. The new suspension and chassis had a wheel track at least [...] wider than the 1971 models. [...] Motor Trend stated the [...] "road isolation and vibrational dampening is superb" [...] in its test of a 1972 Gran Torino Brougham 4-door. Ford offered two suspension options, the heavy-duty and competition suspension. The heavy-duty suspension included a larger front sway bar, and heavy-duty springs and shocks. [...] Competition suspension, only available in two-door models, included the most heavy-duty springs and shocks, heavy duty rear upper control arms and bushings, a larger front sway bar, and the addition of a rear sway bar. This was the first year that a rear sway bar was offered in the Torino and was only available with competition and police suspension options. Front disc brakes became standard on all Torinos, which no other American intermediate (other than its sister car the Mercury Montego) offered in 1972, however, power brakes remained an option. [...] The only exceptions were that power brakes were standard on the Gran Torino Squire station wagons and a mandatory option for all [...] powered models. The power steering was revised to be integral in the steering box, rather than the external booster style used in previous years. All Torinos used 14-inch wheels, while 15-inch wheels were used for exclusively by police and taxi models.|$|E
