In T cells, {{three members of}} this family, inducible T-cell kinase (Itk), resting lymphocyte kinase (Rlk), and Tec, are expressed. In the absence of Itk and Rlk, T-cell receptor signaling is impaired, with defects in mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, Ca(2 +) mobilization, and actin polymerization. During T-cell development in the thymus, no role has been found for these kinases in the CD 4 (+) versus CD 8 (+) T-cell lineage decision; however, several studies indicate that Itk and Rlk contribute to the signaling leading to positive and negative selection. In addition, we and others have recently described an important role for Itk and Rlk {{in the development of}} conventional as opposed to innate CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) T cells. Natural killer T and gammadelta T-cell populations are also altered in Itk- and Rlk/Itk-deficient mice. These findings strongly suggest that the strength of T-cell receptor signaling during development determines whether T cells mature into conventional versus innate <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>lineages.</b> This lineage decision is also influenced by signaling via signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) family receptors.

Our data also indicate that GATA 3 regulates both active and repressive histone modifications of many target genes at their regulatory elements near GATA 3 binding sites. Overall, although GATA 3 binding exhibited both shared and cell-specific patterns among various TÂ cell lineages, many genes were either positively or negatively regulated by GATA 3 in a cell type-specific manner, suggesting that GATA 3 -mediated gene regulation depends strongly on cofactors existing in different TÂ cells...|$|R

We will focus here on current work in humans and mice that has identified core transcriptional circuitry required for the commitment of lymphoid progenitors to the ILC lineage.

Signaling over the common gamma chain (Î³c) cytokine receptor is a critical and non-redundant requirement for the development of all lymphocytes. In both human and mice, absent Î³c cytokine signaling results in a complete block of all T lineage lymphocyte development, including Î±Î² T cells and Î³Î´ T cells, NKT cells and TCRÎ²+CDSÎ±Î± intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL). The reasons for such Î³c cytokine requ irement are not completely understood and still debated. Among others, however, induction of the serine/threonine kinase Pim 1 is a major downstream event as Pim 1 provides survival and increased metabolic activity upon Î³c cytokine signaling. As such, here we asked whether Pim 1 is sufficient to restore lymphocyte development in the absence of Î³c receptor expression. By analyzing Î³c-deficient mice that are expressing a transgenic Pim 1, here we show that Pim- 1 significantly restores Î±Î² T cell development in the thymus and greatly improves peripheral homeostasis of mature T cells. Notably, such effects were largely restricted to CD 4 linage T cells as CDS thymocytes and CDS+ T cells poorly responded to Pim 1 overexpression. Moreover, transgenic Pim 1 failed to restore any other T <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>lineage</b> cells than Î±Î² T cells, as we still observed a complete lack of Î³Î´ T-, NKT-cells and TCRÎ²+CDSÎ±Î± IELs in these mice. Thus, our current results unveil distinct requirements of Î³c downstream signaling between CD 4 + Î±Î² T cells and all other T <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>lineage</b> cells, and propose Pim- 1 as a novel effector molecule, sufficient to drive CD 4 + Î±Î² T cell development and differentiation in the absence of Î³c cytokine signaling...|$|E

We argue that single-cell diversity is a logical evolutionary adaptation for their position in the immune response, and contributes to their ability to kill virus-infected cells. Finally, we look to the future, where emerging single-cell technologies will enable a new generation of rigorous and clinically relevant studies of NK cells accounting for all of their unique and diverse characteristics...|$|E

40|$|The novel immune-type receptors (NITRs), {{which have}} been {{described}} in numerous bony fish species, are encoded by multigene families of inhibitory and activating receptors and are predicted to be functional orthologs to the mammalian natural killer cell receptors (NKRs). Within the zebrafish NITR family, nitr 9 is the only gene predicted to encode an activating receptor. However, alternative RNA splicing generates three distinct nitr 9 transcripts, each of which encodes a different isoform. Although nitr 9 transcripts have been detected in zebrafish lymphocytes, the specific hematopoietic lineage(s) that expresses Nitr 9 remains to be determined.

Here we describe the first structure of a type II NKT TCR complexed with CD 1 d-lysosulfatide (LSF). Both TCR Î± and Î² chains contacted the CD 1 d molecule with a diagonal footprint, typical of MHC-TCR interactions, while the antigen was recognized exclusively with a single TCR chain, similar to the iNKT TCR. Type II NKT cells, therefore, recognize CD 1 d-sulfatide complexes with a distinct recognition mechanism characterized by features of both iNKT cells as well as conventional peptide-reactive T cells.

Insulin enhancer factor 1 (IEF 1), a binding activity previously identified in beta cells, was also present in pituitary endocrine cells but absent in 7 other mammalian cell lines tested. A distinct binding activity, lymphoid enhancer factor 1 (LEF 1), was observed in several lymphoid cell lines, but was absent from all nonlymphoid cells tested. IEF 1 and LEF 1 were distinct according to electrophoretic mobility, and DNA binding specificity. As previously reported, both beta cell and lymphoid cell factors are recognized by antibodies to helix-loop-helix (HLH) proteins, indicating that they may contain functional helix-loop-helix dimerization domains.
