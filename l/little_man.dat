25|$|This task is {{designed}} to measure spatial memory abilities in children. The experimenter asks the participant to visualize a blank matrix with a <b>little</b> <b>man.</b> Through a series of directional instructions such as forwards, backwards, left or right, the experimenter guides the participant's <b>little</b> <b>man</b> on a pathway throughout the matrix. At the end, the participant is asked to indicate on a real matrix where the <b>little</b> <b>man</b> {{that he or she}} visualized finished. The length of the pathway varies depending on the level of difficulty (1-10) and the matrices themselves may vary in length from 2 x 2 cells to 6 x 6.|$|E

It can be determined that both of the writers lived in same social conditions but Orhan Kemal affected by Maksim Gorky because he read Gorky's <b>little</b> <b>men</b> before wrote his novels...|$|R

I don't believe in one strong man {{appearing}} out of so many <b>little</b> <b>men.</b> All men are pretty big in an age, or in a movement, which produces a really big man. And Labour is a great swarm of hopelessly <b>little</b> <b>men.</b> That's how I see it.|$|R

25|$|The {{summit is}} a {{predominantly}} grassy plateau smoothly sloping away {{on all sides}} except to the north, where some shattered crags look down upon Southerndale.

25|$|The plot had young Humpty and his playmates {{turn into}} harlequinade {{characters}} and romp through a candy store, an enchanted garden and Manhattan's costly new City Hall. Fox's mute passivity set {{him apart from}} the raucous clamor surrounding him, and audiences took the <b>little</b> <b>man</b> to their hearts. Humpty Dumpty was revived several times. Fox eventually gave 1,128 performances in the title role, becoming the most highly paid actor of his time. He initiated the tradition of Wednesday matinee's {{to take advantage of}} the show's appeal to children.|$|E

25|$|Based on John O'Gready's {{world famous}} {{photograph}} of Norm Provan (St George) and Arthur Summons (Wests) after the 1963 Grand Final, the trophy represented the premiership pinnacle for {{players in the}} Winfield Era. Its image of the big man and the <b>little</b> <b>man</b> encompasses many of the finer things about Rugby League – the mateship after battle, the satisfaction of the shared experience {{on the playing field}} – no matter how hard and tough the struggle has been, the message that Rugby League, for all its professionalism, is still a game.|$|E
25|$|Thumb was not {{appearing}} in New York City when Lavinia was hired, but {{he met her}} when he visited the Museum {{in the autumn of}} 1862. He told Barnum the same day that he {{had fallen in love with}} her. Thumb wanted Barnum on his side in this love affair (rather than on Nutt's side), so he quietly promised Barnum he would marry Lavinia in a public ceremony. Barnum knew at once that such a spectacle would make him a fortune. He told Lavinia to take Thumb's romantic interest seriously. He reminded her that the <b>little</b> <b>man</b> was rich.|$|E
25|$|Nine-year-old Cassie Logan {{is walking}} {{to school with}} her {{siblings}} Stacey (twelve years old), Christopher-John (seven years old), and <b>Little</b> <b>Man</b> whose real name is Clayton Chester Logan (six years old) in rural Mississippi. Cassie talks about the land on which the Logan family lives. It belonged to Harlan Granger, but he sold 2000 acres of it in 1886 to cover his taxes during Reconstruction. Their grandfather bought two hundred acres in 1887, then another two hundred acres in 1918. After several miles of walking, T.J. Avery and his brother appear. The Avery family sharecrop on the Granger plantation. At school, Cassie and <b>Little</b> <b>Man</b> go to their classroom, where Cassie's teacher, Daisy Crocker, gives them their textbooks, worn-out, outdated castoffs from the white school with a chart that says only white kids used these books up until they were in bad condition, indicating their future uses are intended only for black students. Crocker meets with Cassie's mother, Mary, who calmly glues {{a piece of paper}} over the chart containing the racist indicator in all the books. She hands them back to a dumbstruck Crocker. That Saturday their father, David Logan, comes home from his railroad job in Louisiana, bringing with him L.T. Morrison to assist in planting, farming, protection and other jobs, as Morrison was fired from the railroad for a fight that was the white men's fault. Papa leaves the next day to catch a train.|$|E
50|$|While in the wood, {{the girl}} met three <b>little</b> <b>men.</b> She politely asked {{permission}} {{to come into}} their home, which they gave. Inside, she sat by the fire and began to eat the bread. The three men asked for her to give them some, and having a kind heart, the girl did. The <b>little</b> <b>men</b> directed her to sweep the back steps, and she did so, and - to her great surprise - found the strawberries for which she had been searching. The <b>little</b> <b>men</b> wanted to reward the girl for her kindness, so they each spoke a wish: one declared that she should grow more beautiful every day, the other declared that a gold piece should fall from her mouth whenever she spoke, and the third declared that a king would marry her.|$|R

25|$|Pierce also {{appeared}} alongside Jodie Foster in <b>Little</b> <b>Man</b> Tate, with Anthony Hopkins in Oliver Stone's Nixon, and with Ewan McGregor in Down With Love.

25|$|In year 1843 Barnum {{hired the}} {{traditional}} Native American dancer fu-Hum-Me, {{the first of}} many Native Americans he presented. During 1844–45, Barnum toured with Tom Thumb in Europe and met Queen Victoria, who was amused and saddened by the <b>little</b> <b>man,</b> and the event was a publicity coup. It opened the door to visits from royalty across Europe including the Czar of Russia and let him acquire dozens of attractions, including automatons and other mechanical marvels. He was almost able to buy the birth home of William Shakespeare. Barnum spent about three years abroad with Thumb. Barnum went on a spending spree, buying other museums, including Peale's museum in Philadelphia, the nation's first major museum. By late 1846, Barnum's Museum was drawing 400,000 visitors a year.|$|E
25|$|Josipović {{based his}} {{campaign}} on the slogan 'Justice for Croatia' and kicked off his campaign with a rally {{in front of the}} Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb. He attacked the current Croatian government and the prime minister Jadranka Kosor for ignoring the needs of the <b>little</b> <b>man</b> and criticized her for not dealing with corruption. Andrija Hebrang started the campaign with patriotic rhetoric with the slogan 'For a proud and European Croatia'. He praised Jadranka Kosor and her policies, mostly criticizing Dragan Primorac and Nadan Vidošević for abandoning their party, calling them deserters and traitors of their party. He argued that he offered Primorac and Vidošević an opportunity to settle the question of who will be their party's nominee for president through a primary challenge stating that they both refused.|$|E

60|$|So it {{was that}} he {{resolved}} to leave the <b>little</b> <b>men,</b> the Holdsworthys, alone; and, while he met them in good-fellowship, he chummed with none, and formed no deep friendships. He did not dislike the <b>little</b> <b>men,</b> the men of the Alta-Pacific, for instance. He merely did not elect to choose them for partners in the big game in which he intended to play. What that big game was, even he did not know. He was waiting to find it. And in the meantime he played small hands, investing in several arid-lands reclamation projects and keeping his eyes open for the big chance when it should come along.|$|R
