40|$|As parents and/or <b>legal</b> <b>guardians</b> are {{considered}} {{to be part of the}} care system of a person with intellectual disabilities (ID), it is of import to acquire more specific and transparent views from parents and/or <b>legal</b> <b>guardians</b> regarding quality of support. This study examined the views of parents and/or <b>legal</b> <b>guardians</b> on the quality of support provided to clients with an ID in residential care in the Netherlands, in order to improve the partnership between parents/legal guardians and facilities. A questionnaire developed in close cooperation with parents specifically for this aim was sent to 1, 785 households (parents and/or <b>legal</b> <b>guardians)</b> of clients in the Netherlands. The questionnaire consists of the following five subsections: daily care, housing, day services, leisure activities, and communication. A multiple regression analysis was performed to determine which factors contributed to the satisfaction of parents and/or <b>legal</b> <b>guardians.</b> The questionnaires returned (n= 1, 058) showed that respondents rated the overall quality of support at an average grade of 7. 3 out of 10 (SD: 1. 2). Small but mostly significant differences were found between the subsections. A significant model for the overall quality of support emerged; nevertheless, the predictor variables accounted for only 4. 0 % of the explained variance in the data set. Special attention should be paid to the percentage of parents and/or <b>legal</b> <b>guardians</b> who gave unsatisfactory scores (10 %) and the substantial percentage (25 %) of parents and/or <b>legal</b> <b>guardians</b> that rated the quality of care only marginally satisfactory (grades 67). The results of this questionnaire provide opportunities for optimal use of the qualities and knowledge of parents and/or <b>legal</b> <b>guardians,</b> opportunities for mutual communication between the service organization and parents and/or <b>legal</b> <b>guardians,</b> and guidance for policy regarding improvements in support. ...|$|R

5|$|Parents can {{be either}} the {{biological}} mother or biological father, or the <b>legal</b> <b>guardian</b> for adopted children. Traditionally, mothers were responsible for raising the kids while the father was out providing financially for the family. The age group for parents ranges from teenage parents to grandparents who have decided to raise their grandchildren, with teenage pregnancies fluctuating based on race and culture. Older parents are financially established and generally have fewer problems raising children compared to their teenage counterparts.|$|E

5|$|Encouraged by {{the orphanage}} staff {{who thought that}} Monroe would be happier living in a family, Grace became her <b>legal</b> <b>guardian</b> in 1936, {{although}} she {{was not able to}} take her out of the orphanage until the summer of 1937. Monroe's second stay with the Goddards lasted only a few months, as Doc molested her. After staying with various of her and Grace's relatives and friends in Los Angeles and Compton, Monroe found a more permanent home in September 1938, when she began living with Grace's aunt, Ana Atchinson Lower, in the Sawtelle district. She was enrolled in Emerson Junior High School and was taken to weekly Christian Science services with Lower. While otherwise a mediocre student, Monroe excelled in writing and contributed to the school's newspaper. Due to the elderly Lower's health issues, Monroe returned to live with the Goddards in Van Nuys in either late 1940 or early 1941. After graduating from Emerson, she began attending Van Nuys High School.|$|E

5|$|Wilcke {{was born}} on 11 March 1913 at Schrimm in the Province of Posen, part of the Kingdom of Prussia at the time, now Śrem in the Greater Poland Voivodeship, Poland. He {{was the son of}} a Hauptmann (captain) of Infanterie-Regiment 47 (47th Infantry Regiment), Hans Wilcke, who died of {{pneumonia}} when Wilcke was just four weeks of age. His mother, Hertha von Schuckmann, married again on 14 June 1919. In 1931, Wilcke was arrested for attending a then-illegal demonstration of the Nazi Party. Although his loyalty to the Nazi cause is emphasized multiple times in his personal military files, according to biographers Prien and Stemmer, he was a firm opponent of the National Socialist regime; later in his career, for a time after taking command of III. Gruppe (3rd group) of Jagdgeschwader 53 (JG 53—53rd Fighter Wing), he had the Swastikas on his unit's aircraft painted over. He volunteered for military service in the Reichswehr after receiving his Abitur (diploma). He joined Artillerie-Regiment 6 (6th Artillery Regiment) in Minden as a Fahnenjunker (officer cadet) on 1 April 1934. His <b>legal</b> <b>guardian</b> and stepfather, Friedrich von Scotti, also served in this regiment.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Researchers {{have shown}} that the {{characteristics}} of a person with an intellectual disability (ID), in particular the severity of the disability, are related to the outcomes of professional support. Hardly any studies have asked parents and/or <b>legal</b> <b>guardians</b> for their own opinion about the quality of support given to their child/family member with ID. Therefore, this study examined the relationship between the severity of a person's disability and the opinions voiced by the parents and/or other <b>legal</b> <b>guardians</b> of that person concerning several aspects of the quality of support received in residential care. METHOD: Questionnaires were completed by 1058 parents and/or <b>legal</b> <b>guardians</b> of people with ID living in residential facilities. A multiple covariance analysis was conducted to explore the relationship between the severity of the disability and the parents' and/or legal guardians' opinions. RESULTS: Only small differences in the opinions about the quality of support were observed between parents and/or <b>legal</b> <b>guardians</b> of people with mild to moderate ID and those of people with severe to profound ID. CONCLUSION: This study showed that there are differences in parental opinions about the quality of support, but that most of these differences are not related to the severity of disability. The only significant difference related to the severity of disability is on the leisure activities domain. Parents and/or <b>legal</b> <b>guardians</b> of a person with severe/profound ID were less satisfied with leisure activities than parents and/or <b>legal</b> <b>guardians</b> of persons with mild/moderate ID. It is important to determine to what other factors parental opinions are related, as these opinions concerning the quality of support are important measures alongside client self-reports and measures of the facility itself. The quality of support should be measured using a combination of methods for different stakeholders...|$|R
