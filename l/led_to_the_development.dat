5|$|Astrology saw {{a popular}} revival {{starting}} in the 19th century, {{as part of a}} general revival of spiritualism and—later, New Age philosophy, and through the influence of mass media such as newspaper horoscopes. Early in the 20th century the psychiatrist Carl Jung developed some concepts concerning astrology, which <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of psychological astrology.|$|E
5|$|Bangui {{serves as}} an administrative, trade, and {{commercial}} centre. During the Second World War the country became wealthier as exports of rubber, cotton, coffee, uranium and diamonds increased. After the war, the employment of local people in mainstream administration <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of the country's infrastructure, which increased trade while slowing the national movement for independence.|$|E
5|$|Improvements {{to future}} {{development}} aircraft, such as swept wings {{and more powerful}} Pegasus engines, <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of the Kestrel. The Kestrel was evaluated by the Tri-partite Evaluation Squadron, made up of military pilots from the United Kingdom, the United States, and West Germany. Later flights were conducted by the U.S. military and NASA.|$|E

5|$|In the mid 16th-century Russians adopted {{printing}} from Central Europe, with Ivan Fyodorov {{being the}} first known Russian printer. In the 17th century printing became widespread, and woodcuts became especially popular.

5|$|Parathyroid hormone was {{isolated}} in 1923 by Adolph M. Hanson and 1925 by James B. Collip. Studies of parathyroid hormone levels by Roger Guillemin, Andrew Schally and Rosalyn Sussman Yalow <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of immunoassays capable of measuring body substances and a Nobel Prize in 1977.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{improvements}} in targeting and imaging have <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of stereotactic radiation {{in the treatment}} of early-stage lung cancer. In this form of radiotherapy, high doses are delivered over a number of sessions using stereotactic targeting techniques. Its use is primarily in patients who are not surgical candidates due to medical comorbidities.|$|E
25|$|The {{polymerization}} of acetylene with Ziegler-Natta catalysts produces polyacetylene films. Polyacetylene, a {{chain of}} CH centres with alternating single and double bonds, {{was one of the}} first discovered organic semiconductors. Its reaction with iodine produces a highly electrically conducting material. Although such materials are not useful, these discoveries <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>developments</b> of organic semiconductors, as recognized by the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2000 to Alan J. Heeger, Alan G MacDiarmid, and Hideki Shirakawa.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{increasing}} {{popularity of}} RDF Stream Processing has <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>developments</b> of several RSP engines. Among these, CQELS {{has been developed}} with a native and adaptive approach, which gives it a performance advantage over other engines. However, it currently does not support two important features, namely Complex Event Process-ing and RDFS reasoning. We propose in this paper {{an extension of the}} CQELS query language and semantics towards enriching CQELS with these attractive functionalities...|$|R

The proposed method {{also provides a}} platform under which important statistical issues, such as hypothesis testing and model selection, can be addressed...|$|R

5|$|The {{earliest}} winter {{service vehicles}} were snow rollers, designed {{to maintain a}} smooth, even road surface for sleds, although horse-drawn snowplows and gritting vehicles are recorded in use as early as 1862. The increase in motor car traffic and aviation in the early 20th century <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> and popularisation of large motorised winter service vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The terrain has <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of {{specialised}} frames, {{wheels and}} tyres. Punctures and other mechanical problems are common and often influence the result. Despite the esteem of the race, some cyclists dismiss {{it because of}} its difficult conditions.

The development of the O-Bahn busway <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of the Torrens Linear Park from a run-down urban drain into an attractive public open space. It has also triggered urban development around the north-eastern terminus at Modbury.|$|E
5|$|Aposematism {{has also}} <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of mimicry {{complexes}} of Batesian mimicry, where edible species mimic aposematic taxa, and Müllerian mimicry, where inedible species, often of related taxa, {{have evolved to}} resemble each other, so as to benefit from reduced sampling rates by predators during learning. Similarly, adult Sesiidae species (also known as clearwing moths) have a general appearance that is sufficiently similar to a wasp or hornet to make it likely that the moths gain a reduction in predation by Batesian mimicry.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1916, Canadian {{physicist}} Robert William Boyle {{and other}} scientists of the Anti-Submarine Detection Investigation Committee (ASDIC) undertook research which ultimately <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of sonar technology. Acoustic sounding equipment was developed which could be operated much more rapidly than the sounding lines, thus enabling the German Meteor expedition aboard the German research vessel Meteor (1925–27) to take frequent soundings on east-west Atlantic transects. Maps produced from these techniques show the major Atlantic basins, but the depth precision of these early instruments was not sufficient to reveal the flat featureless abyssal plains.|$|E

5|$|Christianity <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> {{of a few}} {{phenomena}} {{characteristic of}} Byzantium.

And finally, the dichotomy between the Christian ideals of the Bible and classical Greek paideia which could not be left out, however, since so much of Christian scholarship and philosophy depended on it. These shaped Byzantine Greek character and the perceptions of themselves and others.|$|E
5|$|Euler also {{pioneered the}} use of {{analytic}} methods to solve number theory problems. In doing so, he united two disparate branches of mathematics and introduced a new field of study, analytic number theory. In breaking ground for this new field, Euler created the theory of hypergeometric series, q-series, hyperbolic trigonometric functions and the analytic theory of continued fractions. For example, he proved the infinitude of primes using the divergence of the harmonic series, and he used analytic methods to gain some understanding of the way prime numbers are distributed. Euler's {{work in this area}} <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of the prime number theorem.|$|E

Ted Happold was the first to introduce ethylenetetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) as a cladding material, and the outcomes of the research carried out by the laboratory <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> of the designs for the Mannheim Multihall gridshell and a number of landmark fabric structures in the Middle East and the UK, allowing the new building forms to become generally accepted by architects and clients.|$|E
