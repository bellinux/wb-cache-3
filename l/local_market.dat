Some varied ranging definitions of <b>local</b> <b>marketing</b> are [...] "Local marketing is adapting the merchandise offered in an individual store, based on local factors". [...] "Local marketing is the translation of marketing from the national level to local consumer needs." [...] In fact, <b>local</b> <b>marketing</b> has given rise to the term [...] "grassroots marketing", in which marketing activities concentrate on getting close and personally relevant to individual customers' possible level.

By 1986, sales increased to 996 million Swiss francs and the number of employees fell slightly to 19,000 employees. At the same time, sales began in the People's Republic of China and beginning in 1988, individual Triumph products were manufactured under license in East Germany for the <b>local</b> <b>market.</b> This included swimwear in addition to underwear.|$|E
5|$|Navenby was {{originally}} an agricultural village, with most people {{living off the}} land or trading goods in the <b>local</b> <b>market.</b> Statistics show that, in 1841, 48% of villagers worked in agriculture, but today the majority of villagers, 67%, are employed in the service industry and most commute to work away from Navenby. The village does, however, offer limited work opportunities, with the High Street lined with shops, fast-food stores and public houses. A doctors' surgery, building society and residential care home are based in the village, although the post office closed in January 2011.|$|E

Hundreds of free tractors were also handed out. The prices of gas and many foodstuffs were controlled, and local food producers were made to sell in the <b>local</b> <b>market</b> rather than export. A new state-owned body was also set up to distribute food at subsidized prices. All these measures helped to curb inflation, while the economy grew (partly because of rising public spending), accompanied by stronger public finances which brought economic stability.|$|E

Innovative features to help minimise export redevelopment costs, such as a symmetrical centre console housing a flush-fitting hand brake lever, facilitate the conversion to left-hand drive. Internationally, the VE was badge engineered as the Chevrolet Lumina, Chevrolet Omega and Pontiac G8.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} the {{population}} of the nearby village of Burnside was expanding and required a new water supply. First Creekwhich runs down Waterfall Gully and enters the River Torrens near today's Botanic Gardenswas seen as the perfect solution to the water shortage. A weir was built during 1881 and 1882, and was made to hold approximately two megalitres (530,000USgallons) of water. A pipeline was constructed to the reservoir at Burnside South, and from there the water was used throughout the surrounding area. As a side effect, the weir also reduced the volume of water available to the <b>local</b> <b>market</b> gardeners, and over many years that aspect of the region disappeared.|$|E

40|$|The article {{contains}} the typological characterization {{of a system}} of <b>local</b> <b>markets</b> in the context of functions and conditions enhancing the processes of growth. The author distinguishes 7 functions of <b>local</b> <b>markets,</b> i. e. workforce activization, urbanization, integration of market systems, income function, activization of local enterprise, activization of local capital, induction of small industry and services. Next, he defines basic conditions of <b>local</b> <b>markets,</b> such as: the policy of territorial self-government, the policy of cooperative self-government, coordination of the processes of development and construction of the infrastructure of <b>local</b> <b>markets,</b> credit preferences and tax reliefs, local legislation, the organization of market promotion and information, communication, economic conditions of market balance. In the subsequent part of his article the author classifies the system of <b>local</b> <b>markets</b> using the following criteria: subjective, objective, spatial and branch/territorial. The synthetical description of particular markets {{has been used as a}} background for the presentation of some correlations shaped by interest rates in the mechanisms of the budget system and the market system, as the effect of the application of financial and fiscal instruments.

Myers joined HMV in 2006 to oversee the integration of Ottakar's into the chain. In response to the decline in sales, he implemented a three-year plan in which branches were tailored to their <b>local</b> <b>market</b> alongside a 'rejuvenation' of the company brand and an increase in range. As part of these changes, Waterstones implemented new branding in May 2010, developed by agency VentureThree. The company also moved to support the Rainbow Trust, which provides support to children with life-threatening and terminal illnesses and their families, in the same year.|$|E

40|$|Background The wide use of {{pesticides}} raises concerns on the health risks associated with pesticide exposure. For developing countries, like Thailand, pesticide monitoring program (in vegetables and fruits) and also the maximum residue limits (MRL) regulation have not been entirely implemented. The MRL is a product limit, not a safety limit. The MRL is the maximum concentration of a pesticide residue (expressed as mg/kg) recommended by the Codex Alimentarius Commission to be legally permitted in or on food commodities and animal feeds (Codex Alimentarius Commission, 2015; European Commission, 2015). MRLs are based on supervised residue trial data where the pesticide has been applied in accordance with GAP (Good Agricultural Practice). This study aims at providing comparison data on pesticide residues found in three commonly consumed vegetables (Chinese kale, pakchoi and morning glory) purchased from some <b>local</b> <b>markets</b> and supermarkets in Thailand. Methods These vegetables were randomly bought from <b>local</b> <b>markets</b> and supermarkets. Then they were analyzed for the content of 28 pesticides by using GC-MS/MS. Results Types {{of pesticides}} detected in the samples either from <b>local</b> <b>markets</b> or supermarkets were similar. The incidence of detected pesticides was 100 % (<b>local</b> <b>markets)</b> and 99 % (supermarkets) for the Chinese kale; 98 % (<b>local</b> <b>markets)</b> and 100 % (supermarkets) for the pakchoi; and 99 % (<b>local</b> <b>markets)</b> and 97 % (supermarkets) for the morning glory samples. The pesticides were detected exceeding their MRL {{at a rate of}} 48 % (<b>local</b> <b>markets)</b> and 35 % (supermarkets) for the Chinese kale; 71 % (<b>local</b> <b>markets)</b> and 55 % (supermarkets) for the pakchoi, and 42 % (<b>local</b> <b>markets)</b> and 49 % (supermarkets) for the morning glory. Discussion These rates are much higher than those seen in developed countries. It should be noted that these findings were assessed on basis of using criteria (such as MRL) obtained from developed countries. Our findings were also confined to these vegetables sold in a few central provinces of Thailand and did not reflect for the whole country as sample sizes were small. Risk assessment due to consuming these pesticide contaminated vegetables, still remains to be evaluated. However, remarkably high incidence rates of detected pesticides give warning to the Thai authorities to implement proper regulations on pesticide monitoring program. Similar incidence of pesticide contamination found in the vegetables bought from <b>local</b> <b>markets</b> and supermarkets raises question regarding the quality of organic vegetables domestically sold in Thailand. This conclusion excludes Thai export quality vegetables and fruits routinely monitored for pesticide contamination before exporting...|$|R

Fermi befriended another scientifically inclined student, Enrico Persico, and together the two worked on scientific projects such as building gyroscopes and trying to accurately measure the acceleration of Earth's gravity. Fermi's interest in physics was further encouraged by his father's colleague Adolfo Amidei, who gave him several books on physics and mathematics, which he read and assimilated quickly.|$|E

5|$|The small American {{merchant}} {{class and}} {{officers of the}} HBC loaned settlers more credit than most could refund. Fears of creditors demanding restitution from the farmers lead to wheat receipts and scrips issued by the government declared valid currency in 1845. The law decreeing wheat as currency was ridiculed for not establishing financial standards for the merchants, who were de facto bankers. Between 1847 and 1848 the <b>local</b> <b>market</b> for wheat became flooded from overproduction, causing a decline in its value. The legislature repealed previous regulations on 20 December 1847, making only gold, silver and treasury drafts on valid currency. Thus, the creditors of the territory were able to protect their financial standing by removing wheat as tender.|$|E
5|$|Worcester's {{city walls}} are a {{sequence}} of defensive structures built around the city of Worcester in England between the 1st and 17th centuries. The first walls to be built around Worcester were constructed by the Romans. These early walls lasted beyond {{the fall of the}} Empire, and the defences encouraged several early Christian foundations to establish themselves in Worcester during the troubled 6th and 7th centuries. The Anglo-Saxons expanded Worcester in the 890s, forming a new walled, planned city, called a burh. The burh utilised the southern stretches of the old Roman walls, but pushed further north to enclose a much larger area. The Anglo-Saxon city walls were maintained by a share of taxes on a <b>local</b> <b>market</b> and streets, in an agreement reinforced by a royal charter.|$|E
5|$|The first {{indication}} of the franchises' displeasure with their parent over this issue came in 2005 and involved claims by a Manhattan-based franchise that the company failed {{to take into account}} <b>local</b> <b>market</b> conditions when setting prices. E-Z Eating Corp., operator of five restaurants in New York and owned by brother-sister partners Elizabeth and Luan Sadik, had been struggling after the 9/11 terrorist attacks but had been in a company-sponsored turn around program when Burger King started its new value program in 2006. The program required all locations to carry a specific set of products at a discounted price, with limited exemptions for certain locations that met a set of criteria. The Sadiks applied for an exemption to the pricing requirement but were turned down by Burger King. In response to the denial, the Sadiks closed two of their locations without consulting Burger King and refused to implement the scheme in their other two locations. Burger King responded by suing the company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida for breach of contract, and eventually revoked the franchise agreement for the remaining two locations in January 2006. The Sadik's responded by filing their own lawsuit in 2008 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York claiming that Burger King had engaged in a breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair in its actions towards the franchise. The actions were eventually consolidated in a single case in the Southern District Court under Judge Maricia G. Cooke, where Burger King requested and was granted a summary judgement against the Sadiks. The judgment was upheld on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in June 2009.|$|E
