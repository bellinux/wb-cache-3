40|$|We have {{constructed}} a five station 12 GHz atmospheric phase interferometer (API) for the Submillimeter Array (SMA) {{located near the}} summit of Mauna Kea, Hawaii. Operating {{at the base of}} unoccupied SMA antenna pads, each station employs a commercial <b>low</b> <b>noise</b> mixing <b>block</b> coupled to a 0. 7 m off-axis satellite dish which receives a broadband, white noise-like signal from a geostationary satellite. The signals are processed by an analog correlator to produce the phase delays between all pairs of stations with projected baselines ranging from 33 to 261 m. Each baseline's amplitude and phase is measured continuously at a rate of 8 kHz, processed, averaged and output at 10 Hz. Further signal processing and data reduction is accomplished with a Linux computer, including the removal of the diurnal motion of the target satellite. The placement of the stations below ground level with an environmental shield combined with the use of low temperature coefficient, buried fiber optic cables provides excellent system stability. The sensitivity in terms of rms path length is 1. 3 microns which corresponds to phase deviations of about 1 degree of phase at the highest operating frequency of the SMA. The two primary data products are: (1) standard deviations of observed phase over various time scales, and (2) phase structure functions. These real-time statistical data measured by the API {{in the direction of the}} satellite provide an estimate of the phase front distortion experienced by the concurrent SMA astronomical observations. The API data also play an important role, along with the local opacity measurements and weather predictions, in helping to plan the scheduling of science observations on the telescope.
