5|$|Hughes {{was sold}} to Gordon Strachan's Coventry City for a club record {{transfer}} fee of £5,000,001 (the unusual figure was because any offer exceeding £5 million would trigger an escape clause in his West Brom contract) in August 2001. His wages at Highfield Road were reported to be £15,000 a week. Hughes scored 14 goals in 40 games, including a hat-trick in a 6–1 win at Crewe Alexandra, and finished the 2001–02 season as the club's top-scorer. Coventry rejected a <b>loan</b> <b>offer</b> from West Bromwich Albion in March 2002, and ended the season outside the play-offs.|$|E
25|$|In February 2008 the Trust {{secured a}} <b>loan</b> <b>offer</b> that would grant them the funds {{required}} to purchase back Edgeley Park {{if they could}} find a deposit of £1,000,000. From this, spawned the Ground for a Pound initiative, where one million pixels were up for a sale at a pound a piece, with football fans and businesses worldwide asked to collaborate to help the club achieve its goal. Unfortunately, due to technical problems caused by the influx of visitors the launch fell flat, and a relaunch is planned.|$|E
25|$|The {{start of}} 2008–09 season gave Tiago an {{opportunity}} {{to return to the}} Premier League in the form of year-long <b>loan</b> <b>offer</b> from Everton. Juventus agreed to the deal but Tiago refused their terms, favouring to stay in Italy instead. The negotiations between the player and the club had a violent end when Tiago forcibly locked Juventus president Giovanni Cobolli Gigli inside a toilet stall – the chairman was finally rescued by captain Alessandro Del Piero, more than an hour later; after a difficult first season he eventually established himself in Claudio Ranieri's side but, in November 2008, against Inter Milan, he was stretchered off the pitch with a serious knee injury just several minutes into the match, and was sidelined for almost two months.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, {{concerns}} over the club's money issues lingered and led Dave King to suggest fans withhold season ticket money until they receive assurances from the board. This caused a war of words between King and the board with Wallace criticising the boycott call suggesting it could be damaging to the club however, a coalition of Rangers fans groups known as the Union of Fans, supported King's stance on withholding season ticket money. King and the supporters groups were planning to meet in order to formalise legal structures for trusts into which fans could put future season ticket money. This caused the Rangers board to demand that King attend a board meeting where he would explain his recent comments and the following day the club revealed it was considering an alternative <b>loan</b> <b>offer</b> on better terms than Laxey Partners from businessman George Letham. King agreed to this meeting and during a spell in Scotland in mid March, he met with several institutional investors including Laxey Partners, {{as well as the}} Union of Fans and the Plc board. The outcome from the Union of Fans meeting was an agreement for the pooling of season ticket renewal money in a trust fund which would only released to the club when the group was granted security over Ibrox Stadium and Murray Park, however, upon meeting with the board King was informed the club had no intention of using Ibrox or Murray Park for securities on any borrowing. Upon the conclusion of the board meeting, there was an act of good faith on King's part, in which he agreed to a four-week grace period to allow the club to complete and publish a business review of the company, after which King would decide upon continuing with any further action. Whilst agreeing to the grace period, the Union of Fans did decided to press ahead with plans to create a season ticket trust fund. Towards the end of March, the club accepted the <b>loan</b> <b>offer</b> from Letham on the same day as King pledged to invest up £50m of own money in the club. However, the reality of Rangers financial predicament was laid bare just two days later by the publishing of the interim accounts, which reported losses of £3.5m in the six months to 31 December and showed cash reserves had fallen from £21.2m to £3.5m.|$|E
500|$|The first {{instance}} of a non-governmental attempt {{to put an}} issue before the Constitutional Tribunal came from Non-constituency Member of Parliament Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam. He challenged the constitutionality of Singapore's US$5 billion <b>loan</b> <b>offer</b> to Indonesia in November 1997 {{on the basis of}} Article 144(1) of the Constitution which states: [...] "No guarantee or loan shall be given or raised by the Government, except under the authority of any resolution of Parliament with which the President concurs." [...] Jeyaretnam interpreted this to mean that the giving of a loan required parliamentary and presidential approval. The Finance Minister Dr. Richard Hu Tsu Tau did not agree with Jeyaretnam's interpretation of the provision, and stated that the Attorney-General had given advice that the granting of loans and the purchase of securities of this type had the prior approval of two Presidents.|$|E
500|$|Celta Vigo made a <b>loan</b> <b>offer</b> for Mido in March, {{which was}} {{reported}} to have fallen through days later as it was not approved by FIFA. However, FIFA eventually allowed the move to go through and it was completed on 18 March. He scored on his Celta Vigo debut against Athletic Bilbao, which Celta won 2–1. Ajax valued Mido between the values of €5million and €6million, amidst interest from clubs in Italy and Spain. Newcastle United were reportedly on the verge of making a bid for Mido in May, but this was ruled out by Mido's agent Christophe Henrotay. Ajax attempted to make him return to the club, but he declined this, in favour of staying at Celta. He suffered a muscle injury whilst training in May, but was available to play in Celta's match against Villarreal CF, which saw Mido sent off in a game which Celta lost 5–0. Mido was linked with a move to A.S. Roma in late May, with Roma chairman Franco Sensi stating [...] "I want Mido", but Ajax revealed they wanted €15million for him. Ajax turned down a loan move from Real Betis for Mido in June. Marseille were then believed to have made an offer for the striker and Celta were not ready to meet Ajax's asking price of €15million.|$|E

2500|$|Boutwell {{had sought}} finance {{some of the}} debt {{reduction}} through the placement of loans in Europe. [...] This idea was complicated by Civil War claims against the United Kingdom (the so-called Alabama Claims emanating from British support for the CSS Alabama and other Confederate privateers), {{and then by the}} outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War shortly after the financing bill was passed. [...] The latter prevented placement of offers in mainland European financial centers, and the unresolved Alabama issues prevented their placement in London. [...] Political pressure {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic resulted in the 1871 Treaty of Washington, after which Boutwell floated a loan in London. [...] The first <b>loan</b> <b>offer</b> unravelled, however, because Boutwell offered it to too many banks, but a second, reorganized attempt led by financier Jay Cooke succeeded in raising over $100 million.

However, in 1994, after a revision of state bank laws, the company decided to diversify its loan portfolio and services by changing its charter to become a full-service commercial bank. This allowed the bank to experience significant increases in customers, bank branches, loans (which now included commercial and construction loans), and ultimately revenue, doubling its financial size every {{two and a half}} years without the need of consolidations or mergers during the 1990s.|$|R
