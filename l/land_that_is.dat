5|$|In 2000, the United Nations Development Programme, UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, and World Energy Council {{published}} {{an estimate of}} the potential solar energy that could be used by humans each year that took into account factors such as insolation, cloud cover, and the <b>land</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> usable by humans. The estimate found that solar energy has a global potential of 1,575–49,837EJ per year (see table below).|$|E
5|$|In addition, land {{availability}} {{has a large}} {{effect on}} the available solar energy because solar panels can only be set up on <b>land</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> otherwise unused and suitable for solar panels. Roofs {{have been found to}} be a suitable place for solar cells, as many people have discovered that they can collect energy directly from their homes this way. Other areas that are suitable for solar cells are lands that are not being used for businesses where solar plants can be established.|$|E
5|$|Native Americans {{were the}} {{earliest}} {{inhabitants of the}} <b>land</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> today known as the United States and played its first music. Beginning in the 17th century, immigrants from the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Germany, and France began arriving in large numbers, bringing with them new styles and instruments. African slaves brought musical traditions, and each subsequent wave of immigrants contributed to a melting pot.|$|E
50|$|It <b>was</b> alleged <b>that</b> {{some of the}} 3,500 hectare of <b>land</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> {{purchased}} for the route were artificially inflated in price by officials who then received kickbacks from the landowners. <b>Lands</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> in fact farmland were listed as residential, which gave them a higher value.|$|R

5|$|The <b>land</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> now {{the state}} of California was first visited by Europeans when Spanish {{explorer}} Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo visited there in 1542. His report to the Spanish crown garnered little interest, {{and it was not}} until the English seaman Sir Francis Drake touched there in 1579 that the Spanish were moved to colonize the area. Nevertheless, over the next 275 years, California saw few settlers, mostly around the chain of missions that were founded there, both under the Spanish, and subsequently under Mexican rule.|$|E
5|$|The <b>land</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> present-day Oklahoma {{was first}} settled by prehistoric American Indians {{including}} the Clovis 11500 BCE, Folsom 10600 BCE and Plainview 10000 BCE cultures. Historic indigenous peoples who inhabited the region included the Wichita and Caddo peoples. In the 16th century, Spanish explorer Francisco Vásquez de Coronado visited in 1541, beginning European contact. Around the 1700s, two tribes from the north, the Comanches and Kiowas, {{migrated to the}} Oklahoma and Texas region.|$|E
5|$|Wetlands in the {{watershed}} of Roaring Brook include the Freytown and Hollister swamps, which are {{located near the}} stream's headwaters. Between its headwaters and the Hollister Dam, {{the entire length of}} Roaring Brook is on private land. From the Hollister Dam to the Elmhurst Reservoir, 86 percent of its length is on private land. The remaining 14 percent is on private <b>land</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> open to access. Roaring Brook is one of the sources of flooding in Dunmore and Elmhurst Township.|$|E
5000|$|The Heartland Town Centre also {{features}} sections of <b>land</b> <b>that</b> have <b>been</b> left undeveloped. The sections of <b>land</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> currently undeveloped {{will be used}} for future expansion. These expansions will likely include retail, business, or industrial land uses.|$|R

5|$|A {{large part}} of the {{watershed}} of Darby Creek is on developed land, and many suburbs of Philadelphia are in the watershed. The majority (61%) of the land use is considered residential, while 11% is undeveloped and 10% is open space. Of the remaining land, most of it is considered industrial, commercial, and institutional, with 2.45% classified as paved. Estimates for the population of the watershed range from 484,000 to 500,000. In general, the topography of the watershed consists of rolling <b>land</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> densely settled. A large undeveloped tract of land owned by the Delaware County Industrial Development Authority is located {{at the mouth of the}} creek.|$|E
5|$|Harrison County was {{originally}} part of Knox County and Clark County but was separated in 1808. It {{was the first}} Indiana county formed by the Indiana territorial legislature and not the Governor. The county originally contained <b>land</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> now parts of Crawford, Floyd, Washington, Jackson, Clark, Lawrence, Perry, Scott and Orange Counties. The county was named for William Henry Harrison, the first governor of Indiana Territory, and later a General in War of 1812, hero of Tippecanoe, and the 9th U.S. President. Harrison was the largest land holder in the county {{at the time and}} had a small estate at Harrison Spring.|$|E
5|$|If {{the latter}} {{suggestion}} is correct, then Thored's {{first appearance in}} history is the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle recension D (EF)'s entry for 966, which recorded the accession of Oslac to the ealdormanry of southern Northumbria: In this year, Thored, Gunnar's son, harried Westmoringa land, and, in this same year, Oslac succeeded {{to the office of}} ealdorman. The Anglo-Saxon scholar Frank Stenton believed that this was an act of regional faction-fighting, rather than, as had been suggested by others, Thored carrying out the orders of King Edgar the Peaceable. This entry is, incidentally, the first mention of Westmoringa <b>land,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> Westmorland. Gunnar seems to have been ealdorman earlier in the decade, for in one charter (surviving only in a later cartulary) dated to 963 and three Abingdon charters dated to 965, an ealdorman (dux) called Gunnar is mentioned.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{its course}} is through low-lying <b>land</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> at or just above sea level, and regular {{flooding}} {{has been a}} long-standing problem along the waterway. Drainage schemes to alleviate it were constructed {{on both sides of}} the river. The Holderness Drainage scheme to the east was completed in 1772, with a second phase in 1805, and the Beverley and Barmston Drain to the west was completed in 1810. Since 1980, the mouth of the river has been protected by a tidal barrier at the estuary, which can be closed to prevent tidal surges entering the river system and causing flooding upriver.|$|E
5|$|Somerset Place and the <b>land</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> now Pettigrew State Park {{passed through}} the hands of several owners until it was {{acquired}} by the Farm Security Administration in 1937 during the Great Depression. The state of North Carolina administers the land {{under the terms of}} a 99-year lease signed in 1939 with the United States Department of Agriculture. Pettigrew State Park has been expanded at various times since it opened in 1939. Two of the most recent land acquisitions included adding the entire shoreline of Lake Phelps, and the largest expansion, which took place along the Scuppernong River in 2004.|$|E
5|$|The {{geography}} of Scotland in the Middle Ages covers {{all aspects of}} the <b>land</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> now Scotland, including physical and human, between the departure of the Romans in the early fifth century from what are now the southern borders of the country, to the adoption of the major aspects of the Renaissance in the early sixteenth century. Scotland was defined by its physical geography, with its long coastline of inlets, islands and inland lochs, high proportion of land over 60 metres above sea level and heavy rainfall. It is divided between the Highlands and Islands and Lowland regions, which were subdivided by geological features including fault lines, mountains, hills, bogs and marshes. This made communications by land problematic and raised difficulties for political unification, but also for invading armies.|$|E

5|$|The island's {{geography}} comprises relatively low-lying mountains {{surrounding a}} central plain, with several navigable rivers extending inland. The island has lush vegetation, {{a product of}} its mild but changeable climate which is free of extremes in temperature. Thick woodlands covered the island until the Middle Ages. As of 2013, the amount of <b>land</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> wooded in Ireland is about 11% of the total, compared with a European average of 35%. There are twenty-six extant mammal species native to Ireland. The Irish climate is very moderate and classified as oceanic. As a result, winters are milder than expected for such a northerly area. However, summers are cooler than those in Continental Europe. Rainfall and cloud cover are abundant.|$|E
5|$|Upstream of Lick Run, 13 {{percent of}} Roaring Creek is on public <b>land</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> open to access. The {{remaining}} 87 percent is on private <b>land</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> closed to access. The remaining {{reaches of the}} creek are entirely on private land, but open to access. As of 2000, approximately 3,500 people live in the watershed. In section 01, the population density of the watershed is 18 people per square kilometer as of 2000. In section 02, the population density is 22 people per square kilometer and in section 03, the population density is 16 people per square kilometer. In section 01 of the creek, 50 percent of its length is within 100 meters of a road, 89 percent is within 300 meters, and 91 percent is within 500 meters. In section 02, 28 percent is within 100 meters, 87 percent is within 300 meters, and 100 percent is within 500 meters. In section 03, 96 percent of its length is within 100 meters of a road, 98 percent is within 300 meters of one, and 100 percent is within 500 meters of one. The creek flows through a remote-seeming farm valley for {{a substantial part of}} its length. Major roads in or near the watershed include Pennsylvania Route 487, Pennsylvania Route 54, and Pennsylvania Route 42.|$|E
5|$|The {{roots of}} Columbia's three {{economic}} foundations—education, medicine, and insurance—can {{be traced back}} to incorporation in 1821. Original plans for the town set aside land for a state university. In 1833, Columbia Baptist Female College opened, which later became Stephens College. Columbia College, distinct from today's and later to become the University of Missouri, was founded in 1839. When the state legislature decided to establish a state university, Columbia raised three times as much money as any other competing city and James S. Rollins donated the <b>land</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> today the Francis Quadrangle. Soon other educational institutions were founded in Columbia such as Christian Female College, the first college for women west of the Mississippi, which later became the current Columbia College. The city benefited from being a stagecoach stop of the Santa Fe and Oregon trails, and later from the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad. In 1822, the first hospital was set up by William Jewell. In 1830, the first newspaper began; in 1832, the first theater in the state was opened; and in 1835, the state's first agricultural fair was held. By 1839, the population of 13,000 and wealth of Boone County was exceeded in Missouri only by that of St. Louis County, which, at that time, included the City of St. Louis.|$|E
