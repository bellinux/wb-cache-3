5|$|As {{with many}} banks around the world, the Icelandic banks found it {{increasingly}} difficult or impossible to roll over their <b>loans</b> <b>in</b> the interbank market, their creditors insisting on payment while no other banks were willing to make fresh <b>loans.</b> <b>In</b> such a situation, a bank would normally {{have to ask for}} a loan from the central bank as the lender of last resort. However, in Iceland the banks were so much larger than the national economy that the Central Bank of Iceland and the Icelandic government could not guarantee the payment of the banks' debts, leading to the collapse of the banks. The official reserves of the Central Bank of Iceland stood at 374.8 billion krónur at the end of September 2008, compared with 350.3 billion krónur of short-term international debt in the Icelandic banking sector, and at least £6.5 billion (1,250 billion krónur) of retail deposits in the UK.|$|E

5|$|The Inter-American Development Bank {{approved}} $197.4million in <b>loans</b> <b>in</b> 1998, most {{of which}} due to Hurricane Mitch. The loans were to assist in rebuilding damaged infrastructure, including for water systems, transportation, and houses. Various countries provided nearly $2.8billion to the country in aid, which limited the annual debt following the hurricane's damage. The foreign aid due to the storm largely ended by 2003.|$|E
5|$|By Hattie's {{one year}} anniversary, {{private and public}} workers {{repaired}} and rebuilt buildings affected by the storm. New hotels were constructed, and many stores were reopened. Prime Minister George Cadle Price successfully appealed for assistance from the British government, which ultimately provided £20millionin <b>loans.</b> <b>In</b> {{the days after the}} storm, the government announced plans to relocate the capital of British Honduras farther inland on higher ground. Work on the new capital, Belmopan, was completed in 1970. On the 44th anniversary of the hurricane in 2005, the government of Belize unveiled a monument in Belize City to recognize the victims of the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Early investors earned {{three to}} four times their money back due to {{increasing}} property values in Southern California, high occupancy rates, and increasing storage rental prices. By the mid-1980s, Public Storage was raising $200 to $300 million in investments each year. The RELP format allowed the firm to continue building more locations in the 1970s and 1980s when most of the industry had halted growth because of higher interest rates on <b>loans.</b> <b>In</b> the mid-1980s, co-founder Volk retired and his interest in Public Storage was purchased by Hughes. Forbes estimated that by this time the company was worth $800 million.|$|E

5|$|In 1898 the Westbury and Hagley Water Act was passed, {{providing}} {{for construction of}} a reticulated water scheme using water from the Meander River and other streams. Hagley was connected to mains water via the Westbury-Hagley water scheme in 1902. By 1923 residents of Hagley were asking for an upgrade of the system, as it was seen as inadequate by then. The Westbury Council took out <b>loans</b> <b>in</b> 1952 to extend the system, and work on this extension continued into 1954, still connected to Westbury although with larger diameter pipes.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 THSRC {{put through}} a new {{syndicate}} loan, which alleviated the company’s imminent financial burden.

5|$|The {{causes of}} Bolckow, Vaughan's failure included: poor {{decision-making}} {{in the period}} from 1900–1910 which delayed the introduction of improved steelmaking technology; optimistic belief in promises of funding made by the British government during the war, leading to excessive reliance on costly bank <b>loans</b> <b>in</b> 1918, instead of issuing share capital (as the firm later did in 1919 and 1923); failure to diversify into profitable steel products such as pipes, sheet steel and shipbuilding plates; and failure to invest in its own coal mines to provide enough for steel production, and for cash. There were thus both long-term and short-term failures of strategy.|$|E
5|$|After the consulship {{had been}} {{opened to the}} plebeians, the plebeians were able to hold both the {{dictatorship}} and the censorship. Plebiscites of 342 BC placed limits on political offices; an individual could hold only one office at a time, and ten years must elapse {{between the end of}} his official term and his re-election. Further laws attempted to relieve the burden of debt from plebeians by banning interest on <b>loans.</b> <b>In</b> 337 BC, the first plebeian praetor was elected. During these years, the tribunes and the senators grew increasingly close. The senate realised the need to use plebeian officials to accomplish desired goals. To win over the tribunes, the senators gave the tribunes a great deal of power and the tribunes began to feel obligated to the senate. As the tribunes and the senators grew closer, plebeian senators were often able to secure the tribunate for members of their own families. In time, the tribunate became a stepping stone to higher office.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the capital}} used by Glazer to {{purchase}} Manchester United {{came in the form}} of loans, the majority of which were secured against the club's assets, incurring interest payments of over £60million per annum. The remainder {{came in the form of}} PIK loans (payment in kind loans), which were later sold to hedge funds. Manchester United was not liable for the PIKs, which were held by Red Football Joint Venture and were secured on that company's shares in Red Football (and thus the club). The interest on the PIKs rolled up at 14.25% per annum. Despite this, the Glazers did not pay down any of the PIK <b>loans</b> <b>in</b> the first five years they owned the club. In January 2010, the club carried out a successful £500million bond issue, and by March 2010, the PIKs stood at around £207million. The PIKs were eventually paid off in November 2010 by unspecified means. In August 2012, as part of further refinancing, the Glazers sold a number of shares in Manchester United in an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).|$|E

5|$|The IFC makes {{loans to}} {{businesses}} and private projects generally with maturities of seven to twelve years. It determines a suitable repayment schedule and grace period for each loan individually to meet borrowers' currency and cash flow requirements. The IFC may provide longer-term loans or extend grace periods if a project is deemed to warrant it. Leasing companies and financial intermediaries may also receive {{loans from the}} IFC. Though loans have traditionally been denominated in hard currencies, the IFC has endeavored to structure loan products in local currencies. Its disbursement portfolio included loans denominated in 25 local currencies in 2010, and 45 local currencies in 2011, funded largely through swap markets. Local financial markets development is one of IFC’s strategic focus areas. In line with its AAA rating, it has strict concentration, liquidity, asset-liability and other policies.

5|$|With the New Year, {{the coins}} were dated 1893; just over four {{million of the}} {{authorized}} mintage were struck with an 1893 date, with the remainder dated 1892. A total of 5,002,105 Columbian half dollars were struck, with the excess over the authorized mintage designated for inspection by the annual Assay Commission. By February 1893, sales had fallen off dramatically. The Exposition Company deposited 2,000,000 half dollars in Chicago banks as security for <b>loans.</b> <b>In</b> March, Congress impounded an additional 1,141,700 half dollars to cover costs advanced by the government, such as the expense of judging exhibits and providing medals to the exhibitors. The Company could redeem the half dollars if it agreed to fund that expense, which it refused to do, calling the government's action a breach of faith. In return, the Company stated {{it was no longer}} bound by a provision of the 1892 act, which forbade the fair from opening on Sundays.|$|E
5|$|Eastman Kodak sued Apple and Research In Motion (RIM) in January 2010, filing two {{lawsuits}} against Apple and {{a complaint with}} the U.S. International Trade Commission against both Apple and RIM after the companies refused to pay royalties for use of Kodak's patents for digital cameras. Kodak alleged Apple's and RIM's phones infringed on patented Kodak digital imaging technology. Kodak sought an injunction against further imports into the United States of Apple's iPhone and RIM's BlackBerry. After Kodak filed an additional suit in January 2012 against Apple and another against HTC claiming infringement of four of its key patents, Apple filed a countersuit with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to block Kodak's efforts to use the disputed patents as collateral for <b>loans.</b> <b>In</b> the January complaint Kodak claimed violations of the same image preview technology at issue in the original dispute between Kodak, Apple, and RIM that is, as of 2012, pending before ITC. In March 2012, bankruptcy court judge Allen Gropper, overseeing Kodak's restructuring, denied Apple's request to file a patent complaint with the ITC over some of Kodak's cameras, photo frames, and printers. In July 2012, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that Kodak did not infringe on Apple's patent technology for digital cameras, although a few days earlier Kodak lost its case before the ITC against Apple and RIM; Kodak announced it would appeal that decision.|$|E
