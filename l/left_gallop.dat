50|$|Pedro de Valdivia {{believed}} {{that it would be}} preferable to disperse the indigenous forces before they could strike. For this reason, he chose 90-100 men and left for the Cachapoal valley at full <b>gallop.</b> <b>Left</b> behind in Santiago were 32 cavalry, 18 men armed with arquebuses, and between 300 and 350 yanakuna under the command of the Lieutenant General, Alonso de Monroy.|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the significance of}} audible gallop sounds in the right supraclavicular fossa we performed simultaneous external heart sound recordings at 50 and 100 Hz at the left ventricular apex, left sternal border, and right supraclavicular fossa in 50 patients with audible gallop sounds at the left ventricular apex. In each patient heart sounds were recorded with a simultaneous jugular phlebogram, apex cardiogram, and carotid pulse tracing. In 44 patients an apical fourth heart sound coincident with the 'a' wave of the apex cardiogram was recorded, and in 32 (73 %) the fourth heart sound was audible and recordable in the right supraclavicular fossa. A left ventricular third heart sound, coincident with the rapid filling wave of the apex tracing, was present in 25 patients but was recorded in the right supraclavicular fossa in only 7 (28 %). Intracardiac phonocardiography (high-fidelity catheter) was performed in six patients with <b>left</b> ventricular <b>gallop</b> sounds and in each instance arterial transmission of {{the third or fourth}} heart sound, or both, was present. Five additional patients had a prominent jugular venous 'a' wave, but only two had a soft parasternal fourth heart sound. Intracardiac phonocardiography in these five patients failed to reveal transmission of right ventricular gallop sounds to the superior vena cava. We conclude that since <b>left</b> ventricular <b>gallop</b> sounds commonly are transmitted to the right supraclavicular fossa auscultation in this area is often helphful in their detection. In addition, a prominent jugular venous 'a' wave sometimes produces recordable presystolic vibrations that are occasionally audible as well...|$|R
60|$|Even as I {{leaned forward}} to seize his rein, the fugitive, without {{checking}} his horse, without turning his head, drew his revolver from his belt, and, raising his hand, fired behind him at random. He fired towards us, on the chance. The bullet whizzed past my ear, not hitting anyone. We scattered, right and <b>left,</b> still <b>galloping</b> free and strong. We did not return his fire, as I had told the others of my desire to take him alive. We might have shot his horse; but the risk of hitting the rider, coupled with the confidence we felt of eventually hunting him to earth, restrained us. It was the great mistake we made.|$|R

25|$|The corps {{was heavily}} engaged at the Battle of Borodino on 7 September 1812. Early in the morning, the corps was moved up from reserve {{in support of}} Marshal Michel Ney's III Corps attacks on the flèches. Montbrun was killed during the struggle. Around 3:00 PM, the IV Corps under Viceroy Eugène de Beauharnais mounted a frontal assault on the Great Redoubt. The II Cavalry Corps, now led by General of Division Auguste-Jean-Gabriel de Caulaincourt charged the Russian {{infantry}} lines {{to the south of}} the position. Breaking through, the cavalry wheeled to the <b>left</b> and <b>galloped</b> into the open back of the Great Redoubt just as Eugène's infantry fought their way in from the front. The four Russian infantry regiments defending the redoubt were annihilated. During the melee Caulaincourt was slain while leading the 5th Cuirassier Regiment.|$|R
60|$|Here presently, in the distance, we {{saw another}} cavalcade {{pricking}} over the plain. Our two white warriors {{spread to the}} right and <b>left,</b> and <b>galloped</b> to reconnoitre. We, too, put our steeds to the canter, and handling our umbrellas as Richard did his lance against Saladin, went undaunted to challenge this caravan. The fact is, we could distinguish that it was formed of the party of our pious friends the Poles, and we hailed them with cheerful shouting, and presently the two caravans joined company, and scoured the plain at the rate of near four miles per hour. The horse-master, a courier of this company, rode three miles for our one. He was a broken- nosed Arab, with pistols, a sabre, a fusee, a yellow Damascus cloth flapping over his head, and his nose ornamented with diachylon. He rode a hog-necked grey Arab, bristling over with harness, and jumped, and whirled, and reared, and halted, to the admiration of all.|$|R
50|$|S4 is {{sometimes}} audible {{in the elderly}} due to a more rigid ventricle. When loud, {{it is a sign}} of a pathologic state, usually a failing left ventricle. If the problem lies with the <b>left</b> ventricle, the <b>gallop</b> rhythm will be heard best at the cardiac apex. It will become more apparent with exercise, with the patient lying on their left-hand side, or with the patient holding expiration. If the culprit is the right ventricle, the abnormal sound will be most evident on the lower left hand side of the sternum and will get louder with exercise and quick, deep inspiration.|$|R
60|$|Now {{on the top}} of the {{mountain}} was a stretch of land almost flat and stoneless, over which they cantered forward, gathering speed as the horses recovered their wind till the pace grew fast. Suddenly the stallions threw themselves on to their haunches and stopped, as well they might, for they were on the verge of a chasm, at whose far foot a river brawled in foam. For a moment they stood; then, at some word from the Arab, wheeled round, and, bearing to the <b>left,</b> began to <b>gallop</b> back across the tableland, until they approached the edge of {{the mountain}}side, where the brethren thought that they would stop.|$|R
50|$|In 2006 the President of Venezuela Hugo Chávez {{announced}} plans to add an eighth star to the flag of Venezuela {{to bring about a}} much belated fulfillment to Bolívar's 1817 decree. The eighth star represents the Guayana Province, one of the Provinces of Venezuela {{at the time of the}} declaration of independence. The changes also include a white horse <b>galloping</b> <b>left</b> instead of right, a bow and arrow representing Venezuela’s indigenous people and a machete to represent the labor of workers. Although the new flag was approved by the Venezuelan government, opposition spokesperson Óscar Pérez stated that they would not use the new flag.|$|R
6000|$|Lee {{arrived in}} the {{neighborhood}} on the following day, but Hampton had been beforehand with him, made the dash, and [...] "thundered at the gate." [...] Both now hastened to rejoin Sumter {{on the evening of}} the 16th, who was only waiting to collect his detachments, before he made an attack on Colonel Coates at Monk's Corner. The assault was to be made on the following morning. During the night Coates decamped. A pursuit was commenced; Lee with his legion, and Hampton with the State cavalry, took the lead; Sumter followed with the infantry. The rear-guard of the British, about one hundred strong, was overtaken with the baggage, at the distance of eighteen miles. They were new troops recently arrived from Ireland, and had not seen service. On being charged by the cavalry, sword in hand, they threw down their arms without firing a shot, and cried for quarter, which was granted. While Lee was securing them, Captain Armstrong with the first section of cavalry pushed on in pursuit of Coates and the main body. That officer had crossed a wooden bridge over Quimby Creek, loosened the planks, and was only waiting to be rejoined by his rear-guard, to throw them off, and cut off all pursuit. His troops were partly on a causeway beyond the bridge, partly crowded in a lane. He knew nothing of an enemy being at hand, until he saw Armstrong spurring up with his section. Coates gave orders for his troops to halt, form, and march up; a howitzer was brought to bear upon the bridge, and a fatigue party rushed forward to throw off the planks. Armstrong saw the danger, dashed across the bridge, with his section, drove off the artillerists, and captured the howitzer before it could be discharged. The fatigue men, who had been at work on the bridge, snatched up their guns, gave a volley and fled. Armstrong's party, in crossing the bridge, had displaced some of the planks, and formed a chasm. Lieutenant Carrington with the second section of dragoons leaped over it; the chasm being thus enlarged, the horses of the third section refused. A pell-mell fight took place between the handful of dragoons who had crossed, and some of the enemy. Armstrong, seeing the foe too strong in front, and no reinforcement coming on in rear, wheeled off with some of his men to the <b>left,</b> <b>galloped</b> into the woods, and pushed up along the stream to ford it, and seek the main body.|$|R
60|$|One day a great event happened,--and {{after the}} manner of many great events, it began in mystery. Leaping on the roan mare, I was riding like mad for Harrodstown to fetch Mrs. Cowan. And she, {{when she heard the}} summons, {{abandoned}} a turkey on the spit, pitched her brats out of the door, seized the mare, and dashing through the gates at a <b>gallop</b> <b>left</b> me to make my way back afoot. Scenting a sensation, I hurried along the wooded trace at a dog trot, and when I came in sight of the cabin there was Mrs. Cowan sitting on the step, holding in her long but motherly arms something bundled up in nettle linen, while Tom stood sheepishly by, staring at it.|$|R
40|$|A 33 {{years old}} woman was {{admitted}} to the hospital after four days with cough, dyspnea, orthopnea and hemoptysis. Blood pressure was 170 / 90 mmHg, pulse was 112 and temperature was normal. She had cyanosis and a <b>left</b> ventricular <b>gallop,</b> without heart murmurs. A chest radiograph revealed pulmonary edema and echocardiogram showed a global left ventricular systolic disfunction. Oxygen and furosemide were started, but cardiopulmonary collapse ensued. The patient was supported with mechanical ventilation and treated with inotropic drugs. A right sided cardiac catheterization showed pulmonary wedge pressure of 18 mmHg and a cardiac index of 3 l/min/m². The levels of creatinine and urea nitrogen were elevated and a urine protein was 97 mg/dl. Coagulation tests were normal except by a positive lupic anticoagulant. Markers of connective tissue diseases or vasculitis were negatives. The clinical evolution suggested that a catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome was ongoing. Intravenous corticoids, gammaglobulin and cyclofosfamide were administered with transient improvement. On her fourth day of treatment, the patient presented sudden pulmonary bleeding and embolism. A plasmapheresis was performed with improvement of renal, cardiac and pulmonary function. After this episode, the patient has been treated with prednisone and oral anticoagulants treatment for the last two years, without further clinical event...|$|R
5000|$|As {{directed}} by Knyphausen, Major General Edward Mathew had <b>left</b> the <b>Galloping</b> Hill Road and crossed northward to the Vauxhall Road. Halting on a height above the Vauxhall Bridge, he bombarded its defenders with his artillery until 11 a.m., when he attacked, with the Queen’s Rangers and New Jersey Volunteers fording the Rahway {{on either side}} of the bridge. Major Lee and his detachment made a fighting retreat of almost two miles to the upper west branch of the Rahway and positioned his men in echelons, so that they could fire out of the woods onto the road. They were soon joined by the advancing Loyalist troops, who assailed them from front and flank, driving them back again; this time all the way to the slopes of the Short Hills. Here, they were reinforced by the 400 men of General Stark’s two Continental regiments and a cannon. This, and the presence of an increasing number of militia gathering on the slopes of [...] Newark Mountain, persuaded General Mathew to halt his advance. As the militiamen began to engage Colonel Barton’s New Jersey Volunteers, Mathew became concerned about the possibility of a counter-attack on his flank by Washington’s main army, and he turned his column back southward to the Galloping Hill Road to rejoin Knyphausen.|$|R
50|$|Many {{critics have}} {{suggested}} that the horse, now running to the dexter (to the viewer's left) is a political statement of the current left-wing government of President Hugo Chávez. Previously in the Venezuelan arms adopted in 1863, the horse was moving as it is seen today, to the dexter (the viewer's left). Also to note is that in heraldry, positions are not described from the viewer's point of view, but rather the shield's, so while the horse appears to be <b>galloping</b> <b>left</b> to one observing the arms, the horse is actually galloping to the dexter, or right, side of the shield. This symbolizes Venezuela as the first of the independent states of South America, and Simon Bolivar's campaigns of liberation for all of Latin America, which started here in 1811 (with Venezuela's Declaration of Independence and the earlier Caracas Junta of 1810) and ended with his final victory in the Battle of Ayacucho on December 9, 1824, all the while riding his white horse Palomo.|$|R
60|$|Now begins an {{extraordinary}} contest of intellect {{between a man}} and an army. Our horseman, now within {{a quarter of a mile}} of the crest, suddenly wheels to the <b>left</b> and <b>gallops</b> in a direction parallel to it. He has caught sight of his antagonist; he knows all. Some slight advantage of ground has enabled him to overlook a part of the line. If he were here he could tell us in words. But that is now hopeless; he must make the best use of the few minutes of life remaining to him, by compelling the enemy himself to tell us as much and as plainly as possible--which, naturally, that discreet power is reluctant to do. Not a rifleman in those crouching ranks, not a cannoneer at those masked and shotted guns, but knows the needs of the situation, the imperative duty of forbearance. Besides, there has been time enough to forbid them all to fire. True, a single rifle-shot might drop him and be no great disclosure. But firing is infectious--and see how rapidly he moves, with never a pause except as he whirls his horse about to take a new direction, never directly backward toward us, never directly forward toward his executioners. All this is visible through the glass; it seems occurring within pistol-shot; we see all but the enemy, whose presence, whose thoughts, whose motives we infer. To the unaided eye there is nothing but a black figure on a white horse, tracing slow zigzags against the slope of a distant hill--so slowly they seem almost to creep.|$|R
40|$|SummaryStudies of {{locomotion}} in mice {{suggest that}} circuits controlling the alternating between {{left and right}} limbs may have a modular organization with distinct locomotor circuits being recruited at different speeds. It is not clear, however, whether such a modular organization reflects specific behavioral outcomes expressed at different speeds of locomotion. Here, we use detailed kinematic analyses to search for signatures of a modular organization of locomotor circuits in intact and genetically modified mice moving at different speeds of locomotion. We show that wild-type mice display three distinct gaits: two alternating, walk and trot, and one synchronous, bound. Each gait is expressed in distinct ranges of speed with phenotypic inter-limb and intra-limb coordination. A fourth gait, gallop, closely resembled bound {{in most of the}} locomotor parameters but expressed diverse inter-limb coordination. Genetic ablation of commissural V 0 V neurons completely removed the expression of one alternating gait, trot, but <b>left</b> intact walk, <b>gallop,</b> and bound. Ablation of commissural V 0 V and V 0 D neurons led to a loss of walk, trot, and gallop, leaving bound as the default gait. Our study provides a benchmark for studies of the neuronal control of locomotion in the full range of speeds. It provides evidence that gait expression depends upon selection of different modules of neuronal ensembles...|$|R
6000|$|... "So furious {{was that}} first charge of his; 'MAISON-DU-ROI {{covering}} itself with glory,'--for a short while. MAISON-DU-ROI broke three {{lines of the}} Enemy [three, not [...] "Five"]; did in some places actually break through; in others 'could not, but galloped along the front.' Three of their lines: but the fourth line would not break; much the contrary, it advanced (Austrians and English) with steady fire, hotter and hotter: upon this fourth line MAISON-DU-ROI had, itself, to break, pretty much altogether, and rush home again, in ruinous condition. 'Our front lines made lanes for them; terribly maltreating them with musketry on right and <b>left,</b> as they <b>galloped</b> through.' And this {{was the end of}} Grammont's successes, this charge of horse; for his infantry had no luck anywhere; and the essential crisis of the Battle had been here. It continued still a good while; plenty of cannonading, fusillading, but in sporadic detached form; a confused series of small shocks and knocks; which were mostly, or all, unfortunate for Grammont; and which at length knocked him quite off the field. 'He was now interlaced with the English,' moans Noailles; 'so that my cannon, not to shoot Grammont as well as the English, had to cease firing!' Well, yes, that is true, M. le Marechal; but that is not so important as you would have it. The English had stood nine hours in this fire of yours; by degrees, leaning well away from it; answering it with counter-batteries;--and were not yet ruined by it, when the Grammont crisis came! Noailles should have dashed fresh troops across his Bridges, and tried to handle them well. Noailles did not do that; or do anything but wring his hands.|$|R
