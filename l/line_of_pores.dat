40|$|International audienceNanopores, either biological, solid-state, or ultrathin pierced graphene, are {{powerful}} tools which {{are central to}} many applications, from sensing of biological molecules to desalination and fabrication of ion selective membranes. However, the interpretation of transport through low aspect-ratio nanopores becomes particularly complex as 3 D access effects outside the pores are expected to play a dominant role. Here, we report both experiments and theory showing that, in contrast to na¨ıvena¨ıve expectations, long-range mutual interaction across an array of nanopores leads to a non-extensive, sub-linear scaling of the global conductance {{on the number of}} pores N. A scaling analysis demonstrates that the N-dependence of the conductance depends on the topology of the network. It scales like G ∼ N/log N for a 1 D <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>pores,</b> and like G ∼ √ N for a 2 D array, in agreement with experimental measurements.

50|$|The lateral line is {{a system}} of sense organs found in aquatic vertebrates, used to detect movement, vibration, and {{pressure}} gradients in the surrounding water. The sensory ability is achieved via modified epithelial cells, known as hair cells, which respond to displacement caused by motion and transduce these signals into electrical impulses via excitatory synapses. Lateral lines serve {{an important role in}} schooling behavior, predation, and orientation. For example, fish can use their lateral line system to follow the vortices produced by fleeing prey. Lateral lines are usually visible as faint <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>pores</b> running lengthwise down each side, from the vicinity of the gill covers {{to the base of the}} tail. In some species, the receptive organs <b>of</b> the lateral <b>line</b> have been modified to function as electroreceptors, which are organs used to detect electrical impulses, and as such, these systems remain closely linked.

40|$|Several recent {{ion channel}} {{structures}} have revealed large side portals, or ‘fenestrations’ at {{the interface between}} their transmembrane helices that potentially expose the ion conduction pathway to the lipid core of the bilayer.

Our results demonstrate that lipid tails from both the upper and lower leaflets occupy the fenestrations and penetrate into the pore. The lipid tails do not sterically occlude the pore, but there is an inverse correlation between the presence of water within the hydrophobic barrier and the number of lipids tails within the <b>lining</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pore.</b> However, dewetting still occurs in the absence of lipids tails, and pore hydration appears to be determined primarily by those side-chains lining the narrowest part <b>of</b> the <b>pore</b> cavity...|$|R

Substitution of these residues gave channels with reduced sensitivity to [K+](o) in macroscopic current kinetics and voltage dependence, but had only minor effects on selectivity among alkali cations in gating and on single-channel conductance, In some mutants, activation was slowed sufficiently to confer a sigmoidicity to current rise at low [K+](o).

40|$|Biological ion {{channels}} are nanoscale transmembrane pores. When water and ions are enclosed within the narrow {{confines of a}} sub-nanometer hydrophobic pore, they exhibit behavior not evident from macroscopic descriptions.

40|$|Ion {{permeation}} {{and channel}} opening are two fundamental properties of ion channels, the molecular bases {{of which are}} poorly understood. Channels can exist in two permeability states, open and closed. The relative amount of time a channel spends in the open conformation depends {{on the state of}} activation. In voltage-gated ion channels, activation involves movement of a charged voltage sensor, which is required for channel opening. Single-channel recordings of drk 1 K channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes suggested that intermediate current levels (sublevels) may be associated with transitions between the closed and open states. Because K channels are formed by four identical subunits, each contributing to the <b>lining</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pore,</b> it was hypothesized that these sublevels resulted from heteromeric pore conformations.

Experiments using the drk 1 K channel, as well as drk 1 channels with mutations in the pore and in the voltage sensor, showed that the probability of visiting a sublevel correlated with voltage- and time-dependent changes in activation.

40|$|AbstractThe K+ {{channel of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae encoded by the YKC 1 gene {{includes}} two pore-loop sequences that {{are thought to}} form the hydrophilic <b>lining</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pore.</b> Gating <b>of</b> the channel is promoted by membrane depolarisation and is regulated by the extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]o) both in the yeast and when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Our previous work showed that substitutions of equivalent residues L 293 and A 428 within the pore-loops had qualitatively similar effects on both the [K+]o-sensitivity of channel gating and its voltage-dependence. Here, we report that mutations of equivalent residues N 275 and N 410, N-terminal from the K+ channel signature sequences <b>of</b> the two <b>pores,</b> have very different actions on channel gating and, in this case, are without effect on its voltage-sensitivity. The mutation N 410 D slowed current activation in a [K+]o-dependent manner and it accelerated deactivation, but without {{significant effect on the}} apparent affinity for K+. The N 275 D mutant, by contrast, had little effect on the [K+]o-sensitivity for activation and it greatly altered the [K+]o-dependence of current deactivation. Neither mutant affected the voltage-dependence of the steady-state current nor the ability for other alkali cations to substitute for K+ in regulating gating. The double mutant N 410 D-N 275 D showed characteristics of N 410 D in the [K+]o-sensitivity of current activation and of N 275 D in the [K+]o-sensitivity of deactivation, suggesting that little interaction occurs between pore domains with mutations at these sites. The results indicate that the two pore domains are not functionally equivalent and they suggest that the regulation of gating by external K+ is mediated by K+ binding at two physically distinct sites with different actions...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{etching process}} of porous gallium phosphide was studied {{by means of}} the characteristic current–potential sI–Vd curves. Measurements were performed in H 2 SO 4 0. 5 -M aqueous solution both in the dark and by illuminating the samples with the 351 -nm <b>line</b> <b>of</b> an argon laser. Raman spectroscopy was applied to investigate the surface morphology of the samples prepared under different anodizing conditions within the potentiostatic regime. Based on a few reasonable assumptions, a simple model <b>of</b> <b>pore</b> growth is proposed. The enhancing effect in current intensity due to the branching <b>of</b> <b>pores</b> and the opposite effect due to a concomitant decrease in the effective cross area available for carrier transport are accounted for to explain the main features of the recorded I–V curves...|$|R
