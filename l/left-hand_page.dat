60|$|The {{three books}} were really of very great interest. One was an octavo volume of {{manuscript}} in John Evelyn's own hand, {{the beginning of}} his published diary, written as distinctly as print, in a small, clear character. It can be read just as easily as any printed book. Another was a Church of England prayer-book, which King Charles used on the scaffold, and which was stained with his sacred blood, and underneath are two or three lines in John Evelyn's hand, certifying this to be the very book. It is an octavo, or small folio, and seems to have been very little used, scarcely opened, except in one spot; its leaves elsewhere retaining their original freshness and elasticity. It opens most readily at the commencement of the common service; and there, on the <b>left-hand</b> <b>page,</b> is a discoloration, of a yellowish or brownish hue, about two thirds of an inch large, which, two hundred years ago and a little more, was doubtless red. For on that page had fallen a drop of King Charles's blood.|$|E
60|$|Our hospitable friend {{now made}} us drink {{a glass of}} wine, as old and genuine as the curiosities of his cabinet; and while sipping it, we ungratefully tried to excite his envy, by telling of various things, {{interesting}} to an antiquary and virtuoso, which we {{had seen in the}} course of our travels about England. We spoke, for instance, of a missal bound in solid gold and set around with jewels, but of such intrinsic value as no setting could enhance, for it was exquisitely illuminated, throughout, by the hand of Raphael himself. We mentioned a little silver case which once contained a portion of the heart of Louis XIV. nicely done up in spices, but, to the owner's horror and astonishment, Dean Buckland popped the kingly morsel into his mouth, and swallowed it. We told about the black-letter prayer-book of King Charles the Martyr, used by him upon the scaffold, taking which into our hands, it opened of itself at the Communion Service; and there, on the <b>left-hand</b> <b>page,</b> appeared a spot about as large as a sixpence, of a yellowish or brownish hue: a drop of the King's blood had fallen there.|$|E

50|$|To Zwicky, form is {{integral}} to meaning. As part of this view, she maintains that {{the form of a}} linguistic gesture determines a speaker's ontological commitments more thoroughly than any explicit content. For this reason, her own texts have an unusual structure: they are double texts. In both Lyric Philosophy and Wisdom & Metaphor, her own aphoristic remarks on the <b>left-hand</b> <b>pages</b> are meant to be read with and against excerpts from the history of philosophy, musical scores, paintings, photographs and poems. Her books are thus dialectical or polyphonic in nature, i.e. there are many voices that range across disciplines.|$|R
50|$|Glynne's church notes, in 106 volumes, are now housed at Gladstone's Library (formerly St Deiniol's Library), Hawarden; but {{are made}} {{available}} to researchers through Flintshire Record Office. A single notebook of a six-week tour made in 1824 is in the National Library of Wales. Glynne generally made his notes on the right-hand pages of his notebooks, reserving the <b>left-hand</b> <b>pages</b> for later addenda and sketches. In the years 1845-8, Glynne published 72 of his descriptions of churches anonymously in The Ecclesiologist (journal of the Ecclesiological Society). Otherwise, his notes remained unpublished during his lifetime, but since his death a growing number have appeared in print, mainly arranged by county, and in several cases published by local archaeological and record societies. A list appears below. Glynne's original manuscript notes for Kent, which were published by W.H. Gladstone in 1877, {{are believed to have}} been destroyed.|$|R

Recorded on 14 November 1969 by Marc Gaborieau and Mireille Helffer of the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS). The recording was transcribed in the field by Man Bahadur Kathayat of Dandeldhura in one of Gaborieau's notebooks, labelled "VIVEK" p. 1 - 24 (right-hand pages). The entire epic was translated into French in draft form by Gaborieau in the field (same notebook, <b>left-hand</b> <b>pages).</b> Prof Jaya Raj Pant revised the transcription and prepared a translation into standard Nepali, plot outlines, and vocabulary notes in 2007.

The east end of Long Lake is in T 26 N R 16 W S 7, Holt Co. The lake is over a mile long and quite narrow, with a lot of rushes and emergent vegetation, in places growing completely across the lake. The open water is in fragmented strips and patches. The young Swans were getting good sized but still noticeably smaller than the adults.

5000|$|Verso Books was {{originally}} known as New Left Books. The name was changed in 2008.

50|$|Rotating {{bookmarks}} were {{a special}} kind of bookmark used in medieval Europe. They were attached to a string, along which a marker could be slid up and down to mark a precise level on the page.

5000|$|Martin's Latin chronicle, the Chronicon pontificum et imperatorum, was {{intended}} for the school-room. It is mostly derivative in content and is therefore of limited value to modern historians. However, its importance is {{in the way the}} material is presented, which is a quantum leap forward in didactic method. The genius lies in its layout; each double page covers fifty years with fifty lines per <b>page.</b> The <b>left-hand</b> <b>pages</b> give the history of the papacy, with one line per year, and the right-hand pages give the history of emperors, the two accounts being kept strictly parallel. This was a revolutionary approach in graphic design, which was not appreciated by all his contemporaries: many manuscripts simply copy the text without retaining the page layout, which results in a rather chaotic chronology. The chronicle was enormously influential; over 400 manuscripts are known, and the influence on many dozens of later chroniclers is palpable. Translations were made into many medieval vernaculars, including Middle English, as well as an Old French translation by Sébastien Mamerot. Martin's Chronicon is the most influential source for the legend of [...] "Pope Joan". Other of his works include the Promptuarium Exemplorum.|$|R

5000|$|It {{was when}} he was {{brainstorming}} with the founding editors of the magazine (founded by former Pilote friends and co-artists {{in the wake of the}} revolt at the publisher, when they decided to strike out on their own), that Giraud came up with his first major Mœbius work, [...] "Le bandard fou" [...] ("The Horny Goof"). Released directly as album (a first for Mœbius comics) in black & white by the magazine's publisher, [...] the humorous and satirical story dealt with a law-abiding citizen of the planet Souldaï, who awakens one day, only to find himself with a permanent erection. Pursued through space and time by his own puritanical authorities, who frown upon the condition, and other parties, who have their own intentions with the hapless bandard, he eventually finds a safe haven on the asteroid Fleur of Madame Kowalsky, after several hilarious adventures. When discounting the as [...] "Gir" [...] signed [...] "La déviation", it is in this story that Giraud's signature, minute [...] "Mœbius" [...] art style, for which he became famed not that much later, truly comes into its own. Another novelty introduced in the book, is that the narrative is only related on the right-hand pages; the <b>left-hand</b> <b>pages</b> are taken up by one-page panels depicting an entirely unrelated cinematographic sequence of a man transforming after he has snapped his fingers. The story did raise some eyebrows with critics accusing Giraud of pornography at the time, but one reviewer put it in perspective when stating, [...] "Peut-être Porno, mais Graphique!", which loosely translates as [...] "Porn maybe, but Graphic Art for sure!". In the editorial of the 1990 American edition, Giraud has conceded that he was envious of what his former Pilote colleagues had achieved with L'Écho des savanes in regard to creating a free, creative environment for their artists, he had already enjoyed so much back at Hara-Kiri, and that it was an inspiration for the endeavor, Giraud embarked upon next.|$|R
