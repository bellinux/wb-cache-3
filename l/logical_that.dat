5|$|Sergey Zagraevsky, {{a modern}} art historian, {{surveyed}} hundreds of Russian icons and miniatures, from {{the eleventh century}} onward. He concluded that most icons painted after the Mongol invasion of Rus display only onion domes. First onion domes displayed on some pictures of twelfth century (two miniatures from Dobrylov Evangelie). He found only one icon from the late fifteenth century displaying a dome resembling the helmet instead of an onion. His findings led him to dismiss fragments of helmet domes discovered by restorators beneath modern onion domes as post-Petrine stylisations intended to reproduce the familiar forms of Byzantine cupolas. Zagraevsky also indicated that the oldest depictions of the two Vladimir cathedrals represent them as having onion domes, prior to their replacement by classicizing helmet domes. He explains the ubiquitous appearance of onion domes in the late thirteenth century by the general emphasis on verticality characteristic of Russian architecture from the late twelfth to early fifteenth centuries. At that period, porches, pilasters, vaults and drums were arranged to create a vertical thrust, to make the church seem taller than it was. It seems <b>logical</b> <b>that</b> elongated, or onion, domes {{were part of the}} same proto-Gothic trend aimed at achieving pyramidal, vertical emphasis.|$|E

More {{recently}} it became a plague of low- and middle-income countries, except those in sub-Saharan Africa, where the P. vivax map has a conspicuous hole. Overall it accounts for 65% of malaria cases in Asia and South America. It is <b>logical</b> <b>that</b> plasmodium vivax is found there where humans and mosquito population are high. It is uncommon in cooler areas.|$|E

25|$|It is possible, though, that a {{more likely}} {{scenario}} {{may be that the}} specialized precision gripping hand (equipped with opposable thumb) of Homo habilis preceded walking, with the specialized adaptation of the spine, pelvis, and lower extremities preceding a more advanced hand. And, it is <b>logical</b> <b>that</b> a conservative, highly functional adaptation be followed by a series of more complex ones that complement it. With Homo habilis, an advanced grasping-capable hand was accompanied by facultative bipedalism, possibly implying, assuming a co-opted evolutionary relationship exists, that the latter resulted from the former as obligate bipedalism was yet to follow. Walking may have been a by-product of busy hands and not vice versa.|$|E
25|$|The shallowness of orca tanks forces orcas {{to spend}} a lot of time at the surface. So much time at the surface leads to {{prolonged}} exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays. Prolonged exposure to the surface and UV rays is attributed to sunburns and the development of cataracts in orcas in captivity. Orcas in the wild would live at higher latitudes, meaning less intense sun, and spend more time in deeper, darker waters. While it is uncertain the effects of prolonged UV exposure to orcas' skin, since captive orca necropsies are extremely secretive, it seems <b>logical</b> <b>that</b> prolonged exposure to UV rays on unprotected skin would have the same negative effects such as melanoma (skin cancer) on orcas as it does on humans.|$|E
25|$|Ectomycorrhizas provide many {{benefits}} to their host plants, with enhanced nutrient uptake, growth and establishment in disturbed habitats ranked highly among them. Thus, it seems <b>logical</b> <b>that</b> EcM fungi {{could be used}} in restoration projects aimed at re-establishing native plant species in ecosystems disrupted by a variety of issues. In addition to providing a certain degree of protection to seedlings in harsh circumstances, such as increased salinity or heavy metal pollution, the fungi are also instrumental in improving soil quality. They are able to achieve this through allowing the establishment of early vegetation and subsequent organic litter, preventing erosion, and binding soil particles together yielding stability and soil aggregation. Since the disappearance of mycorhizal fungi from a habitat constitutes a major soil disturbance event, its re-addition {{is an important part of}} establishing vegetation and restoring habitats.|$|E

500|$|Marlborough's first {{official}} act was {{to assist in}} the remodelling of the army – the power of confirming or purging officers and men gave the Earl the opportunity to build a new patronage network which would prove beneficial over the next two decades. His task was urgent, for less than six months after James II's departure, England joined the war against France as part of a powerful coalition aimed at curtailing the ambitions of LouisXIV. With his experience it was <b>logical</b> <b>that</b> Marlborough took charge of the 8,000 British troops sent to the Low Countries in the spring of 1689; yet throughout the Nine Years' War (1688–97) he saw only three years service in the field, and then mostly in subordinate commands. However, at the Battle of Walcourt on 25 August 1689 Marlborough won praise from the Allied commander, Prince Waldeck – [...] "...despite his youth he displayed greater military capacity than do most generals after a long series of wars... He is assuredly one of the most gallant men I know". In recognition of his skill and valour William awarded him the lucrative colonelcy of the 7th Foot (later the Royal Fusiliers).|$|E

Post-Keynesian economists are apt to point out that, whether people are buying or not, matters a great deal to the overall functioning of the economy, and matters a great deal to overall profitability.

2500|$|Because {{there is}} this {{apparent}} focus on the absent person, it seems <b>logical</b> <b>that</b> physical descriptions play into the remembrance of the absent. It is quite obvious that the body is the focus in this poem. There are 14 references to body parts (eye and heart). While the body was not an exploited object in Renaissance times, it was a focus of love nonetheless. Lever notes that it was commonplace of romance [...] "entered through the eyes and penetrated to the heart." [...] Furthermore, [...] "Renaissance fancy…developed the conceit, with love engraving upon the heart the lady's image. The engraving became a portrait, with the eyes as windows through which it could be seen." [...] In a time when courtship was more formal and suitors or lovers were viewed from afar, {{it makes sense that}} one would struggle with relying on the eye for physical knowledge of the other, but need the heart to fully read and connect to the person.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the engine}} inside the locomotive's hood didn't {{take up the}} full carbody width, it seemed only <b>logical</b> <b>that</b> the hood could be [...] "cut away" [...] a bit, leaning towards what was then more {{typically}} switch engine practice, to allow the crew to see the train more easily from inside the cab, and also to ride more safely outside the cab, but while hopefully retaining the style and looks of a full width carbody type. Thus, they created an early [...] "road switcher", which combined the power and speed of a mainline [...] "road" [...] engine with the visibility and convenience of a switch engine, and which have since become ubiquitous on North American railroads. This wasn't an entirely new idea, as the Pennsylvania Railroad's GG1 fleet, which featured large cutout sections in its hoods, had been in service since 1934 (although without external riding platforms). Both the BL and GG series attempted to preserve the stylish appearance of a carbody unit, to make them suitable for passenger duty, but subsequent road switchers have adopted a purely utilitarian appearance, and are most often used for freight service.|$|E
2500|$|Heinze {{has written}} a number of opinion pieces that {{have focused on the}} {{relations}} between Catholics and Jews. It was <b>logical</b> <b>that</b> he would be interested in the subject because he was a Jew who worked in a Catholic university, he was faculty advisor for the school's Jewish Student Union, and he was director of the school's Jewish Studies program. There was another, more personal, reason for his interest, however; in 1997 he had met Jan Karski, the courageous Polish Catholic who was recognized in 1982 as Righteous Among the Nations for his efforts to help the Jews in World War II. (Karski had said in 1981, [...] "just as my wife’s entire family was wiped out in the ghettos of Poland, in its concentration camps and crematoria — so have all the Jews who were slaughtered become my family. But I am a Christian Jew... I am a practicing Catholic... My faith tells me the second original sin has been committed by humanity. This sin will haunt humanity to the end of time. And I want it to be so.”) After Karski delivered the keynote address at the first Swig function Heinze had presided over, he had spent some personal time with Heinze and his family; Heinze never forgot Karski's gentle warmth, his integrity and his courage.|$|E
