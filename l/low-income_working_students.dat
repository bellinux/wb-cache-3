40|$|This {{exploratory}} study examines {{the difference between}} two college persistence factors—resiliency and institutional engagement—for <b>low-income,</b> <b>working,</b> first-generation college <b>students.</b> Participants in the study consisted of 52 respondents to the Family History Knowledge and College Persistence Survey. Among respondents, 50 students reported participating {{in some form of}} employment, with 9 students in work-study, 22 students in off-campus employment, and 19 students in both work-study and off-campus employment. Data analysis shows a signifi-cant relationship between resiliency and employment type, but no significant relationship between institutional engagement and employ-ment type. Our findings indicate students who balance academics and employment exhibit a higher resiliency toward attaining graduation. Edward F.

40|$|There {{has been}} a raft of policy changes in the UK that are {{intended}} to help low-income families engage with the labour market. Drawing in part upon {{the findings of a}} small-scale qualitative study of the experiences of <b>low-income</b> <b>working</b> families, this article infers that the secular trend to working parenthood may, as matters stand, be experienced rather differently by secure middle-class families than by poor families. It may be that the former will benefit from policies to improve access to formal childcare, career breaks and time off when needed. The latter are more likely to remain dependent on informal childcare from other family members or friends and receive minimal concessions granted by reluctant employers. While benefits such as working families tax credit will help to secure the material needs of <b>low-income</b> <b>working</b> families, low-paid employment will remain no less precarious and {{it is possible that the}} insecurity experienced by <b>low-income</b> <b>working</b> families will increase. ...|$|R
40|$|This policy brief {{offers a}} {{framework}} for analyzing state tax changes affecting <b>low-income</b> <b>working</b> families from 2002 to 2006. This timeframe encompasses the difficult choices states faced in the latest recession and the years just beyond as state revenues recovered. Lessons learned about how state tax policy choices affected low-income families during and immediately after the reces-sion can help states refine their choices in the future. States often raise taxes during recessions, and depending on the design, those tax increases can fall hard on lower-income families.

40|$|In 2012, {{there were}} more than 10 million <b>low-income</b> <b>working</b> {{families}} with children in the United States,and 39 percent were headed by working mothers. The economic conditions for these families have worsened since the onset of the recession; between 2007 and 2012, there was a four percentage-point increase in the share of female-headed working families that are low-income. Addressing challenges specific to these families will increase their economic opportunity, boost the economy and strengthen the fabric of communities across the nation. Public policy can {{play a critical role in}} our future prosperity by reversing this trend and improving outcomes for <b>low-income</b> <b>working</b> mothers. Of particular interest is how state governments can best invest in helping working mothers gain the education, skills and supports necessary to become economically secure and provide a strong economic future for their children. In this brief, we highlight the latest data from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey and recommend state government policies and actions that would facilitate the economic advancement of female-headed, <b>low-income</b> <b>working</b> families with children under age 18...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} new empirical findings from a qualitative, {{longitudinal study of}} <b>low-income</b> <b>working</b> family life. It explores the experiences and perceptions {{of a group of}} children living in <b>low-income,</b> <b>working,</b> lone-mother households. Their accounts disclose the impact on children's everyday lives of their mothers' move into low-paid employment following a period out of the labour market. Children's accounts show that their mothers' move into work had brought significant economic and social change to their lives. How children experienced their mothers' employment and made sense of changes in family life was mediated by a range of different factors including their age, changes in income and security, changes in family time and family practices, child care, and their perceptions of maternal wellbeing. The findings also reveal that children, as active social agents, were engaged in a complex range of caring and coping strategies that endeavoured to ease some of the pressures that <b>low-income</b> <b>working</b> life could generate in their family lives. The article concludes with a discussion about the implications of the findings for policy, particularly in relation to the quality of social and economic support that lone mothers and their children receive...|$|R

40|$|State-funded Pre-K {{programs}} {{represent the}} most rapidly expanding {{segment of the}} U. S. educational system. Debate exists about whether the expansion of state-funded universal Pre-K will positively or negatively affect the supply and quality of child care for <b>low-income</b> <b>working</b> families. The debate stems from whether Pre-K expansion will contribute to (or detract from) the already available early child care and education resources within communities. Some stakeholders believe Pre-K programs {{have the potential to}} positively affect local early education programs and organizations (e. g., child care centers, family child care homes, Head Start, or faith-based providers) by adding funds, elevating standards, and/or introducing more stringent monitoring. On the contrary, others caution that Pre-K programs may have unintentional negative effects, such as siphoning highly qualified teachers away from local organizations. Another concern is that Pre-K programs will result in the preschool-age population being separated from infants/todders and school age children. Still, others argue that <b>low-income</b> <b>working</b> families {{may not be able to}} take advantage of Pre-K expansion efforts if such services are not offered via a mixed-delivery system that include collaborative partnerships with local child care centers.

In their new study, Jeannette Wicks-Lim and Jeffrey Thompson advance proposals to substantially strengthen minimum wage laws and the federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program in the United States, so that, in combination, they can guarantee decent living standards for all full-time U.

By considering minimum wage laws and the EITC as complements, they show how these measures can operate most effectively and, crucially, how any possible negative unintended consequences of each measure can be minimized.
