40|$|We have {{developed}} a Microsoft Excel application that utilizes eclipsing binary ephemerides to calculate useful information for a program of observing eclipsing binary systems. Eclipsing binary star systems consist of two stars orbiting a common center of mass and oriented so that their plane of orbit is {{in the line of}} sight relative to the observer allowing the stars to eclipse each other. Consistent monitoring of eclipsing binary stars is important for establishing fundamental astronomical parameters, for instance mass and composition of stellar systems, and this application supports effective use of resources in such monitoring programs. The input variables to the application include system coordinates, system period, starting Epoch, and the user’s latitude and longitude. The program uses astronomical algorithms to calculate the epoch, Julian date, Gregorian date, local time, times of primary/secondary eclipse, altitude, Universal <b>Time,</b> <b>Local</b> Mean <b>Sidereal</b> <b>Time,</b> and hour angle of the eclipsing binary system.

50|$|Sidereal time is {{time by the}} stars. A sidereal {{rotation}} is {{the time}} it takes the Earth to make one revolution with respect to the stars, approximately 23 hours 56 minutes 4 seconds. For accurate astronomical work on land, it was usual to observe sidereal time rather than solar time to measure mean solar time, because the observations of 'fixed' stars could be measured and reduced more accurately than observations of the Sun (in spite of the need to make various small compensations, for refraction, aberration, precession, nutation and proper motion). It is well known that observations of the Sun pose substantial obstacles to the achievement of accuracy in measurement. In former times, before the distribution of accurate time signals, {{it was part of the}} routine work at any observatory to observe the sidereal times of meridian transit of selected 'clock stars' (of well-known position and movement), and to use these to correct observatory clocks running local mean sidereal time; but nowadays <b>local</b> <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> is usually generated by computer, based on time signals.|$|E
50|$|To {{create a}} horoscope, an astrologer first has to {{ascertain}} the exact time and place of the subject's birth, or the initiation of an event. The local standard time (adjusting for any daylight saving time or war time) is then converted into Greenwich Mean Time or Universal Time at that same instant. The astrologer then has to convert this into the <b>local</b> <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> at birth {{in order to be}} able to calculate the ascendant and midheaven. The astrologer will next consult a set of tables called an ephemeris, which lists the location of the Sun, Moon and planets for a particular year, date and sidereal time, with respect to the northern hemisphere vernal equinox or the fixed stars (depending on which astrological system is being used). The astrologer then adds or subtracts the difference between the longitude of Greenwich and the longitude of the place in question to determine the true local mean time (LMT) at the place of birth to show where planets would be visible above the horizon at the precise time and place in question. Planets hidden from view beneath the earth are also shown in the horoscope.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{database}} of 343 free-response ESP trials conducted at {{centers in the}} U.

Two patterns were observed: ESP was found to succeed only during periods of enhanced pulsation activity within the 0. 2 – 0. 5 Hz band, but ESP effect was absent during the most disturbed periods of activity in the 0. 025 – 0. 1 Hz band. The pattern of ESP effect by <b>local</b> <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> was similar to that found by Spottiswoode (1997 b), and this shape was found to be attributable to the pattern of ESP results by pulsation activity in the 0. 2 – 0. 5 Hz band.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Sidereal</b> <b>Time</b> {{literally}} means star time. The time we {{are used}} to using in our everyday lives is Solar Time. Astronomy, time based upon the rotation of the earth with respect to the distant stars, the sidereal day being the unit of measurement. Traditionally, the sidereal day is described as the time it takes for the Earth to complete one rotation relative to the stars, and help astronomers to keep them telescops directions on a given star in a night sky. In other words, earth’s rate of rotation determine according to fixed stars which is controlling the <b>time</b> scale of <b>sidereal</b> <b>time.</b> Many reserachers are concerned about how long the earth takes to spin based on fixed stars since the earth does not actually spin around 360 degrees in one solar day. Furthermore, the computations of the <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> needs {{to take a long time}} to calculate the number of the Julian centuries.

40|$|Abstract-We analyze a {{database}} of 3, 325 free response anomalous cognition experiments, using procedures recently used {{in an analysis of}} a catalog of UFO events. A histogram analysis shows evidence of a significant annual modulation in the success rate, but no significant evidence for modulations associated with time of day or <b>local</b> <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> (LST). The salient feature of a power spectrum formed by the Lomb-Scargle procedure is a peak at a frequency very close to twice the lunar synodic frequency. The probability that this feature occurs by chance is estimated to be 0. 03 %. A running-wave analysis indicates that this is an astronomical effect rather than a spurious property of the data-base. We also find a peak in the power spectrum with a period of one year. This could be associated with an LST effect, but the running-wave test, which is designed to distinguish between a real LST effect and a spurious LST effect, does not support this interpretation...|$|E

For convenience in making Corrections against standard transmitted time signals, the actual time displayed (solar) is I. S. T.

40|$|Nothing {{is known}} about the {{physical}} mechanism of anomalous cognition (AC), or ESP. A first step towards generating focused hypotheses would be the discovery of a physical parameter which clearly modulated AC performance. In this paper, an association between the <b>local</b> <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> (LST) at which a trial occurs and the resulting effect size is described. In an existing database of 1, 468 free response trials, the effect size increased 340 % for trials within 1 hour of 13. 5 h LST (p = 0. 001). A independent database of 1, 015 similar trials was subsequently obtained in which trials within 1 hour of 13. 5 h LST showed an effect size increase of 450 % (p = 0. 05) providing confirmation of the effect. Possible artifacts due to the non-uniform distribution of trials in clock time and variations of effect size with experiment are discussed and rejected as explanations.
