The {{aim of this}} study was to analyze the results of 66 laparoscopic procedures in the diagnosis, staging, and restaging of hematological malignancies localized in the abdominal cavity. METHODS: Between July 1993 and March 1998, 64 consecutive patients (28 male and 36 female; mean age 46. 6 years, range 7 to 69) with diagnosed or suspected <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>diseases</b> were referred for primary diagnosis or reassessment and for staging/restaging. RESULTS: Sixty-two out of 66 procedures (93. 9 %) were completed laparoscopically.

40|$|Autoimmune and <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>diseases</b> {{share some}} {{etiologic}} mechanisms. The {{origin of the}} diseases is complicated process that involves an accumulation of hereditary and somatic mutations in a hematopoetic cell, which thanks to changed activity overcomes different growth and survival control checkpoints. Such mutations are for example those located in genes coding for transcription factors, apoptotic signaling molecules, costimulatory molecules and secreted exctracellular molecules. All these molecules influence the balance between survival and programmed cell death. Their dysregulated expression enables the cell to overcome defensive mechanisms of the immune system. Therefore, autoimmune and malignant cells are able to survive though, under usual circumstances, they would be selected. The main aim of this work is to shed {{the light on the}} influence of the dysregulated expression of the particular molecules on the origin of autoimmune and <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>diseases.</b> Key words: autoimmune ilnesess, <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>diseases,</b> etiology, AIRE, c-MYC, TP 53, FOXP 3, Fas, PTEN, Bim, CTLA- 4, CD 5, CD 30, CD 40 /CD 40 L, BAFF, α-taxilin, IL- 10...|$|R
40|$|We have {{conducted}} a study of a novel monoclonal A 3 antibody raised by means of hybridoma biotechnology. The study was performed with malignant cells of the patients with various lymphoproliferative disorders, and persons with nonmalignant diseases, as compared with intact lymphocytes from healthy people, using a method of immunocytochemical staining and indirect immunofluorescence technique. It was found that in cases of <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>diseases</b> with low proliferation rates, as based on the numbers of Ki- 67  positive cells, {{as well as in}} non-malignant blood diseases, the A 3 antigen was localized in nucleoli, and it was visualized as focal fluorescence. In malignant <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>diseases</b> with high proliferation indexes, the number of brightly fluorescent foci is observed, with formation of necklace-like structures within the nucleolar structures. The obtained data point to a diagnostic significance of A 3 Mab in assessment of cellular proliferative rates in patients with various <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>diseases.</b> It was established that, in contrast to Ki- 67, the proliferation stage could be determined for each cell, according to the number of fuorescent foci in nucleoli.

Higher levels of c-myc mRNA expression were observed in lymphomas as compared with pseudolymphomas (p greater than 0. 05). No significant differences in c-myc mRNA values were detected between B and T cell pseudolymphomas. Our results suggest that c-myc mRNA overexpression is associated with malignant lymphomas of the skin.

40|$|Genetic {{abnormalities}} predisposing to autoimmunity generally act in {{a cooperative}} manner affecting one or several mechanisms regulating immunological tolerance. In addition, many of these genetic abnormalities are also involved {{in the development of}} <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>diseases.</b> In the present study, we have determined the possible cooperation between deficiencies in members of the Cip/Kip family of cell cycle regulators (p 21 (WAF 1 /Cip 1) or p 27 (kip 1)) and the overexpression of human Bcl- 2 in B lymphocytes in the induction of autoimmune and <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>diseases</b> in non-autoimmune C 57 BL/ 6 (B 6) mice. Unlike single mutant mice, B 6. p 21 (-/-) mice transgenic for human Bcl- 2 in B cells developed a lethal autoimmune syndrome characterized by the production of autoantibodies, the prominent expansion of memory B and CD 4 (+) T cells and the development of severe glomerular lesions resembling IgA nephropathy. Furthermore, these mice presented a high incidence of B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. Such genetic cooperation in the induction of autoimmunity was not observed in B 6. p 27 (-/-) mice transgenic for human Bcl- 2 in B cells. Altogether, what we have demonstrated here is the existence of preferential interactions among particular regulators of the G(1) /S transition of the cell cycle and B-cell survival in the induction of systemic autoimmune and <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|R

40|$|Between 1955 and 1963, an {{estimated}} number of 150 mill people {{in various parts}} of the world, including Norway, received poliomyelitis vaccine possibly contaminated with infectious simian virus 40 (SV 40). Human studies have investigated the hypothesised association between SV 40 and various cancers, but the results have so far been contradicting. The aim of the present study was to examine Norwegian cancer incidence data to assess a possible association between the incidence rate of lymphoproliferative disorders, and birth cohorts assumed to have been subjected to the vaccine. Between 1953 and 1997, the incidence rate of <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>diseases</b> increased about three-fold in both males and females. Age-period-cohort modelling showed that the cohort effect was more prominent than the period effect. Although the variations in incidence pattern to some extent fit with the trends as expected if a SV 40 contaminated vaccine did play a causative role, crucial parts of the cohort pattern deviate from the expected trend. Thus, our data do not support the hypothesis of an association between the vaccine and <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>diseases.</b> A significant upward trend shift was observed for those who were born after 1932. These cohorts were in childhood and early adolescence during WWII, a period when the Norwegian population was exposed to an increased infectious load through a relatively large contingent of German soldiers, civilians, and prisoners of war. This finding extends the prevailing notion of an infectious etiology to the disease by suggesting that infectious exposure early in life is of particular importance in establishing the risk for <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|R

As of now, data of herpesvirus-associated CNS diseases in transplant recipients is limited. Hence, in this prospective study, we investigated the incidence of herpesvirus-associated CNS diseases and explored the diagnosis of these diseases in 281 allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) recipients. Herpesvirus-DNA and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cells were sampled from 58 recipients with herpesvirus-associated diseases or with unexplainable CNS manifestations. Results showed that 23 patients were diagnosed as herpesvirus-associated CNS diseases, including 15 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) -associated diseases (4 encephalitis and 11 <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>diseases),</b> 5 herpes simplex virus type 1 encephalitis, 2 cytomegalovirus encephalitis/myelitis and 1 varicella zoster virus encephalitis. The median time of diseases onset was 65 (range 22 - 542) days post-transplantation. The 3 -year cumulative incidence of herpesvirus-associated encephalitis/myelitis and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) was 6. 3 % ± 1. 9 % and 4. 1 % ± 1. 2 %, respectively. Of the evaluable cases, CSF cells mainly consisted of CD 19 (+) CD 20 (+) B cells (7 / 11) and had clonal rearrangement of immunoglobulin genes (3 / 11) in patients with CNS-PTLD. On the contrary, in patients with encephalitis/myelitis, CSF cells were comprised of different cell populations and none of the gene rearrangement was detected.
