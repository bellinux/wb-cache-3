5|$|By 1980 the bridge's {{structure}} {{had come}} under attack from marine woodworm, which threatened its closure. British Rail discovered that woodworm had eaten into 69 of the supporting pillars and estimated it would cost £2.5 million to repair. Locomotive-hauled trains were banned, which immediately resulted in the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> from Tywyn, including explosives traffic {{to and from the}} factory at Penrhyndeudraeth. That traffic was re-routed via Maentwrog Road railway station and the Conwy Valley Line. However, Gwynedd County Council were opposed to closing the bridge completely as 40% of all railway traffic in the area was tourist related. The government applied for a £2.5 million grant from the EEC to repair the bridge, with a further £4.6m being spent on improving the signalling. The bridge was closed entirely to traffic for six months during the temporary repair works eventually undertaken, and 30 of the piles were replaced.|$|E
25|$|The <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> from Bellefonte Furnace {{hurt the}} railroad, which was sold at {{foreclosure}} on December 1, 1891. It was reorganized on May 9, 1892, as the Bellefonte Central Railroad.|$|E
25|$|Despite the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> that {{followed}} this decision, the Central Railroad continued operations and improvement of its right-of-way. Besides {{the opening of}} Hecla Park, the railroad eliminated its last wooden trestle, over the present Pennsylvania Route 550 and adjacent ravine, {{and replaced it with}} a fill and iron bridge in November 1896. In 1899, Walter Ross resigned as president, to be replaced by Charles Clement.|$|E

30|$|For the {{proposed}} model, basic {{functions of the}} relationships between <b>loss</b> ratio <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> volume and precipitation; depth of AWORS and drainage efficiency; and <b>loss</b> ratio <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> volume and recovery coefficient were first determined based on Chung et al. (2006), the Bernoulli equation of fluid dynamics, and the principle of Hooke’s Law, respectively. The precipitation and traffic data from 1 April to 5 July 2012 were then used to calibrate these basic functions, and the data from 6 July to 5 August 2012 were used for model validation.|$|R
50|$|In 1952, the Ligonier Valley Railroad ceased operation, {{due to a}} {{combination}} of overlogging, decline of the coal industry, and the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> passenger <b>traffic</b> to motor vehicles.|$|R
25|$|By 1800, {{the canal}} {{was in a}} poor condition, and another £57,000 of public money was spent {{refurbishing}} it over the following ten years. Closures during the refurbishment resulted in a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic,</b> which did not fully recover. In 1829, both canals were transferred to a private company, who spent £80,000 on improvements over the next twenty years. The ship canal was enlarged in 1884, to allow ships of 5,000 tons to reach Newry. It reverted to public ownership in 1901, when the Newry Port and Harbour Authority was created. The canal closed in 1936 {{and most of it}} was officially abandoned in 1949, with some in 1956. The ship canal closed in 1966 and the Authority was wound up in 1974.|$|E
500|$|An {{announcement}} for {{the construction}} of passing lanes on the two-lane Highway3 between Monarch and Fort Macleod came in 1985, though Fort Macleod Mayor Olmstead stated the project was simply delaying the inevitable twinning that would be required for the route. [...] He remained concerned about the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> to his community caused by the Monarch interchange, and was confident that twinning of Highways2 and 3 would offset the loss. [...] Twinning of both routes continued in the late 1980s.|$|E
500|$|With news of {{the planned}} Rochdale Canal link into Manchester, the company {{proposed}} to extend the canal from Bury through Littleborough, and {{to connect with the}} Rochdale Canal at Sladen. [...] The new route, known as the Bury and Sladen Canal, was intended as a rival scheme to the proposed Rochdale link into Manchester. [...] A survey was also carried out on a proposed extension from Sladen to Sowerby Bridge. [...] The company also considered links to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and the Mersey and Irwell Navigation. [...] These plans would have substantially increased the trans-Pennine traffic using the company's canal, and caused a potential <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> and revenue on the nearby Bridgewater Canal. [...] With this in mind, the owner of the Bridgewater Canal, the Duke of Bridgewater, agreed to allow the Rochdale Canal Company to connect to his canal at Manchester. [...] Despite the persistence of the canal company, the Rochdale Canal plan won the day and in 1797 the company abandoned the Bury and Sladen Canal plan.|$|E
50|$|Link {{protection}} {{is designed to}} safeguard networks from failure. Failures in high-speed networks {{have always been a}} concern of utmost importance. A single fiber cut can lead to heavy <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> and protection-switching techniques have been used as the key source to ensure survivability in such networks. Survivability can be addressed in many layers in a network and protection can be performed at the physical layer (SONET/SDH, Optical Transport Network), Layer 2 (Ethernet, MPLS) and Layer 3 (IP).|$|R
50|$|In 1964, rail {{services}} to the town ceased after {{the closure of the}} nearby sulfur pit and the ensuing <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> freight <b>traffic,</b> which made operation of the line uneconomic.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century some further {{passenger}} connections were opened, but in the twentieth century widespread decline took place as collieries and iron works reduced their output and eventually closed, followed by widespread <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> passenger <b>traffic.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The Grand Junction and Oxford canal {{companies}} were bitter rivals.

Some of these lines had never been profitable and were not subject to <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> in that period. The railways were busy during World War II, {{but at the end of}} the war they were in a poor state of repair, and were soon nationalised as British Railways.|$|E
2500|$|Belknap's {{legacy is}} that of both notable virtues and flaws. He was commended for bravery during the Civil War, but while Secretary of War he {{undermined}} the military careers of William Tecumseh Sherman and Oliver Otis Howard. [...] He preserved Mathew Brady's photographic history of the American Civil War, provided speedy aid to victims of the Great Chicago Fire, enforced Grant's Reconstruction policy, and started the National Weather Service. [...] However, Belknap side stepped neutrality policy in the Franco-Prussian War, aiding the French obtain military rifles. Belknap and his wives accepted kickbacks {{at the expense of}} soldiers who relied on military trading posts. Belknap permitted white settlers to overrun the Black Hills after they had been promised to the Lakota people by treaty. Until Grant explicitly told to him to stop, Belknap attempted to prevent completion of America's first steel cantilever bridge by arbitrarily changing the design specifications to include expensive, unnecessary modifications at the request of Mississippi River steamboat operators who feared a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> to railroads that would use the new Eads Bridge; Belknap was alleged to have accepted payments from the steamboat companies in exchange for his actions. [...] After he left office in disgrace, the War Department experienced unprecedented turmoil, going through a succession of four Secretaries of War within a 13-month period.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background A <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> {{function}} of the L-type calcium channel, Cav 1. 2, results in a cardiac specific disease known as Brugada syndrome. Although many Brugada syndrome channelopathies reduce channel function, one point mutation in the N-terminus of Cav 1. 2 (A 39 V) {{has been shown to}} elicit disease a phenotype because <b>of</b> a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> surface <b>trafficking</b> <b>of</b> the channel. This lack of cell membrane expression could not be rescued by the trafficking chaperone Cavβ. Findings We report that despite the striking <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>trafficking</b> described previously in the cardiac Cav 1. 2 channel, the A 39 V mutation while in the background of the brain isoform traffics and functions normally. We detected no differences in biophysical properties between wild type Cav 1. 2 and A 39 V-Cav 1. 2 in the presence of either a cardiac (Cavβ 2 b), or a neuronal beta subunit (Cavβ 1 b). In addition, the A 39 V-Cav 1. 2 mutant showed a normal Cavβ 2 b mediated increase in surface expression in tsA- 201 cells. Conclusions The Brugada syndrome mutation A 39 V when introduced into rat brain Cav 1. 2 does not trigger the loss-of-trafficking phenotype seen in a previous study on the human heart isoform of the channel. </p...|$|R

50|$|In 1924 {{the first}} bus service to Edinburgh was started, and by 1931 the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> {{passenger}} <b>traffic</b> to buses was extreme: the {{revenue for the}} year 1931 - 1932 was £466, and closure to passengers became inevitable. Closure to passenger traffic was fixed for 10 September 1932, and the last passenger train ran on that day. A low level <b>of</b> goods <b>traffic</b> continued for the time being.|$|R
50|$|In 1890 {{there was}} bitter {{competition}} between the North British Railway and the Caledonian Railway, for the traffic northwards from central Scotland.
