40|$|This is a {{case study}} of tourism {{policies}} made around the Satpura Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh, India. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyse the state tourism policies in Madhya Pradesh. The study is divided in two parts, the first part analyses the state tourism policies using Foucault’s governmentality theory. The governmentality theory is used to expose the ideas in the policies with consideration to neoliberalism and the <b>local</b> <b>communities.</b> The first part also examine the ideas of inclusion of the <b>local</b> <b>communities</b> in tourism. The second part are interviews with officials and semi-officials that are implementing the policies. The <b>local</b> <b>communities</b> are the focus in this study since tourism is marketed as a solution to economic growth and employment. Therefore, one of the aspects is if the <b>local</b> <b>communities</b> are a resource in the development of tourism, and if there is any obstacles for the <b>local</b> <b>communities</b> to participate in the tourism industry. The material used is state tourism policies from 2005 and 2016. Interviews were conducted in Pachmarhi, Madhai, Soghagpur, Pipariya and Bhopal. The conclusion is that the state tourism policy from 2016 is clearly neo-liberal that the market and the government is clearly in concurrence. When it comes to the <b>local</b> <b>communities</b> the main problem for participation is that most of the <b>local</b> <b>communities</b> lack of skills, however the type of tourism were the <b>local</b> <b>communities</b> could be beneficiaries is not the tourism that the state government is developing...|$|R
40|$|The {{creation}} of {{national parks and}} its effects on the <b>local</b> <b>community's</b> livelihoods has been a discussed topic for many years. The {{reason for this is that}} the {{creation of}} national parks has the potential to impair the livelihoods of the <b>local</b> <b>communities</b> that live in or around the national park. In this report it will be examined if the creation of national parks and the protection of biodiversity can be done in such a manner that it will not have any negative effects on the livelihood of the <b>local</b> <b>communities</b> living in or around the national park. This report determines the effects on the biodiversity and the <b>local</b> <b>communities</b> in and around the national park. The conclusion is derived from the analysis and the discussion, that in some cases the relocation of <b>local</b> <b>communities</b> creates a negative idea around the national parks. This can make the <b>local</b> <b>communities</b> hostile towards the national park which can cause a loss in the biodiversity. Other examples shows that national parks help promote biodiversity in the area.
