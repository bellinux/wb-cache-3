60|$|On {{the evening}} of the second day, Miss Frost got her hand from under the bedclothes, and laid it on Alvina's hand. Alvina <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> her.|$|E
2500|$|She {{asks him}} for a kiss to [...] "comfort me" [...] and when he <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> kiss her she pulls him from the saddle and drowns him. She swims to the shore and thanks God that [...] "The dangers she o'ercame".|$|R
50|$|Tristram, who in {{this piece}} married Isolt of the White Hands, carries his {{winnings}} instead to Mark's wife Queen Isolt, who is upset that Tristram married another woman. The two mock {{each other for a}} brief period before Tristram at last puts the necklace about Isolt's neck, and <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> kiss her.|$|R
50|$|A ground quiver is {{used for}} both target {{shooting}} or warfare when the archer is shooting from a fixed location. They can be simply stakes in {{the ground with a}} ring at the top to hold the arrows, or more elaborate designs that hold the arrows within reach without the archer having <b>to</b> <b>lean</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> draw.|$|R

60|$|Tom Platt <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> {{a locker}} {{and brought up}} an old white fiddle. Manuel's eye glistened, and from somewhere behind the pawl-post he drew out a tiny, guitar-like thing with wire strings, which he called a machette.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly Slone's {{sensitive}} ear vibrated to {{a thrilling}} sound. He <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> place {{his ear to}} the sand. Rapid, rhythmic beat of hoofs made him leap to his feet, reaching for his lasso with right hand and a gun with his left.|$|E
50|$|Dying {{of colon}} cancer in a {{hospital}} bed, William Andrews' wife <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> him and sees {{a smile on his}} face, which she wrongly perceives as being for her. In fact, he is merely ecstatic at the sensation of leaving his body, and therefore all of his pain, behind. At the centre of his vision he sees a pinprick of white light which steadily expands.|$|R
60|$|He {{called out}} in warning, {{but the girl}} did not heed. The willows were thinner at the spot she had reached, and, {{squeezing}} herself through them, she <b>leaned</b> <b>down,</b> clinging <b>to</b> an alder branch.|$|R
5000|$|Martin Butlin {{wrote that}} this colour print {{is one of}} the most {{inspired}} of all 'literal' illustrations of a text in the history of art. In fact, [...] "pity and air", two words of the Shakespeare's verses, are also two motifs used by Blake in this picture: a female cherub <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> snatch the baby from its mother. According to Blake biographer Alexander Gilchrist, the print [...] "is on a tolerably large scale, a woman bending <b>down</b> <b>to</b> succour a man stretched out at length, as if given over to death." ...|$|R
60|$|As Dave <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> give Poole his hand, {{the door}} of the barn was flung open and a farmer strode in, a lantern {{in one hand and a}} stout stick in the other. The man held the light over his head and looked around suspiciously.|$|E
60|$|Equally {{indolent}} {{were the}} motions of the Mosula youth as he drew his skiff beneath an overhanging limb of a great tree that <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> implant a farewell kiss upon the bosom of the departing water, caressing with green fronds the soft breast of its languorous love.|$|E
6000|$|He took no notice, and {{she thought}} {{that he must be}} fast asleep. She laid her hand on his shoulder, and repeated, [...] "I am ready!" [...] Still he was motionless; and with a sudden {{confused}} fear, she <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> him, took off his velvet cap, and leaned her cheek close to his head, crying in a distressed tone-- ...|$|E
60|$|She began <b>to</b> shiver. Groves <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> {{and tried}} <b>to</b> peer through the keyhole. He {{rose to his}} feet hastily.|$|R
40|$|Danny Boyle {{might have}} shown it thus at the Olympic Opening Ceremony {{in one of}} his nostalgic tableaux of British history: A {{delivery}} boy in hobnail boots wobbles over the village green on a heavy framed bicycle, laden down with sacks of newspapers balanced precariously on his handle-bars. Citizens in tartan dressing gowns clutching mugs of tea <b>lean</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> their door mats to retrieve their copy of the The Times with headlines about the main changes in Her Majesty’s Government’s following the previous day’s reshuffle...|$|R
60|$|He {{glanced at}} the Captain, who nodded back. In a few moments the Doctor reappeared. He <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> and whispered <b>to</b> the Captain.|$|R
60|$|Jocelyn Thew {{paid for}} his {{telephone}} call and walked leisurely {{out of the hotel}} with a smile upon his lips. The stimulus of danger was like wine to him. The little man was choosing a cigar at the stall. As he <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> light it, Jocelyn Thew's practiced eye caught the shape of a revolver in his hip pocket.|$|E
60|$|Nobody {{told them}} to do it, but all the hands were clapped heartily before a single child stirred; then {{one by one they}} came to look up wonderingly at the pretty giver of the feast as she <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> offer them great yellow oranges, red apples, bunches of grapes, bonbons, and cakes, till all were gone, and a double row of smiling faces turned toward her as the {{children}} filed back to their places in the orderly way they had been taught.|$|E
6000|$|At {{the turn}} of road, however, the quick trot stopped, {{and in a moment}} a lady on a bay mare came pacing slowly into sight,--a young and pretty lady, all in dark blue, with a bunch of dandelions like yellow stars in her button-hole, and a silver-handled whip hanging from the pommel of her saddle, evidently more for {{ornament}} than use. The handsome mare limped a little, and shook her head as if something plagued her; while her mistress <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> see what was the matter, saying, as if she expected an answer of some sort,-- ...|$|E
50|$|The {{claims were}} based on Edward's {{appearance}} and the circumstances surrounding his overseas birth. During his own lifetime, {{it was noted that}} Edward showed little resemblance to his father. Unlike his father, he was well over six feet tall, an exceptional height for the age; but notably, his younger brother George was also tall and fair (and said to bear a marked resemblance to Edward), whilst their sister Margaret stood five feet eleven inches, remarkable for a medieval woman (observers of her wedding to Charles the Bold of Burgundy remarked that the bride towered over the groom - she had <b>to</b> <b>lean</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> receive his kiss).|$|R
50|$|On Liberation Day, the Jackal, {{disguised}} as an elderly veteran amputee, enters the building {{he had chosen}} earlier. He assembles his rifle, hidden disassembled {{in one of his}} crutches, and waits at a window in an upper apartment. When Lebel finds out a policeman allowed a man to pass through the cordon, the two race to the building. As de Gaulle presents the first medal, the Jackal shoots, but misses when the tall president suddenly <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> kiss the recipient on the cheek. Lebel and the policeman burst in. The Jackal shoots the policeman, but Lebel kills him. The Jackal, never fully identified, is later buried in an unmarked grave.|$|R
50|$|The Deputy is then {{seen in a}} {{hotel room}} reading {{newspaper}} articles on a computer, when he stumbles across one which shows Courtney and Clint on their wedding day. Suddenly, articles about the murder in the church flood the screen, before Bughuul's symbol and a loud buzzing appear and the screen cuts out. When he <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> collect his bag, the reflection of the screen shows Bughuul standing in the bathroom doorway behind the Deputy. When the Deputy sees it and looks behind him, there is nothing there. Bughuul then appears in the reflection again, before walking forward and putting his finger to his lips. The Deputy slams the laptop screen closed.|$|R
60|$|Again {{he raised}} his voice in {{the call of the}} bull ape to its mate, but there was no reply; then he <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> sniff at the body of Gazan. In the breast of this savage, hideous beast there beat a heart which was moved, however slightly, by the same {{emotions}} of paternal love which affect us. Even had we no actual evidence of this, we must know it still, since only thus might be explained the survival of the human race in which the jealousy and selfishness of the bulls would, in the earliest stages of the race, have wiped out the young as rapidly as they were brought into the world had not God implanted in the savage bosom that paternal love which evidences itself most strongly in the protective instinct of the male.|$|E
60|$|As if impelled by a {{dark and}} {{sinister}} force, he slowly <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> pull his bag from under the bed. He opened it, and drew out his Colt's automatic gun. Though the June day was warm this big worn metal weapon had a cold touch. He {{did not feel that}} he wanted to handle it, but he did. It seemed heavy, a thing of subtle, latent energy, with singular fascination for him. It brought up a dark flowing tide of memory. Lane shut his eyes, and saw the tide flow by with its conflict and horror. The feel of his gun, and the recall of what it had meant to him in terrible hours, drove away a wavering of will, and a still voice that tried to pierce his consciousness. It fixed his sinister intention. He threw the gun on the bed, and rising began to pace the floor.|$|E
60|$|But {{somehow the}} Birds liked him. They {{had seen him}} often in the forest, dancing about like an elf after the eddying leaves, or {{crouched}} up {{in the hollow of}} some old oak-tree, sharing his nuts with the squirrels. They did not mind his being ugly, a bit. Why, even the nightingale herself, who sang so sweetly in the orange groves at night that sometimes the Moon <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> listen, was not much to look at after all; and, besides, he had been kind to them, and during that terribly bitter winter, when there were no berries on the trees, and the ground was as hard as iron, and the wolves had come down to the very gates of the city to look for food, he had never once forgotten them, but had always given them crumbs out of his little hunch of black bread, and divided with them whatever poor breakfast he had.|$|E
50|$|The story {{then returns}} to Mears and Petrie {{at the church}} in Guatemala two years later. It quickly becomes clear that {{they are on the}} run from the {{surviving}} vampires from Salem's Lot, who have been relentlessly pursuing them. Their supplies of holy water glow whenever a vampire is nearby. Realising that they have been tracked down yet again, Mears and Petrie return to their lodgings to collect their belongings. However, once there, Mears finds Susan lying in his bed. Now a vampire, she prepares to bite him as he <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> kiss her, but he drives a stake through her heart. Filled with grief, he and Petrie leave, knowing that vampires will forever hunt them.|$|R
5000|$|Christie (Nicole Muñoz) {{tries to}} take care of Alak's hand while she says to him that his father is crazy but Alak makes excuses for him by saying that he is the only one {{responsible}} for his father actions. Stahma comes in the room and when she sees what Datak did to Alak she gets angry. The next day, Datak goes to his business tent only to find Stahma and Alak there {{with the rest of the}} men waiting for him. Stahma makes it clear that she is the one who is in control and has Datak beaten and thrown out of the tent. Then, she walks towards him, <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> him and tells him [...] "You should have made me a partner" [...] and leaves.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{her classmates}} {{suggested}} to partner Mikage and Kaede {{as she was}} always alone. So, Anise sabotaged Kaede to become the art muse while Mikage and she drew out Kaede asleep. While Anise ran off in finding Mutsuki. Mikage talks to the sleeping Kaede, saying her words [...] "I want him I want him so badly." [...] and seemingly <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> kiss Kaede. When Anise returns {{to where they were}} situated, Mikage asks Anise to do a favor for her: get Kaede to go on a date with her. At her date with Kaede, she acts as a normal girl, being thrilled on having the chance to go out with the boy of her dreams. Finally, at the ferry wheel ride does she start to give away her true motive.|$|R
60|$|At noon {{the next}} day, Tallente, nervously {{as well as}} {{physically}} exhausted with the long climb from the Manor, turned aside from the straight, dusty road and seated himself upon a lichen-covered boulder. He threw his cap on the ground, filled and lighted an old briar pipe, and gazed with a queer mixture of feelings across the moorland to where Woolhanger spread itself, a queer medley of dwelling house and farm buildings, strangely situated {{at the far end}} of the table-land he was crossing, where the moor <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> a great hollow in the hills. The open stretch of common which lay between him and his destination had none of the charm of the surrounding country. It was like a dark spot set in the midst of the rolling splendours of the moorland proper. There were boulders of rock of unknown age, dark patches of peat land, where even in midsummer the mud oozed up at the lightest footfall, pools and sedgy places, the home and sometimes the breeding place of the melancholy snipe. Of colour there was singularly little. The heather bushes were stunted, their roots blackened as though with fire, and even the yellow of the gorse shone with a dimmer lustre. But in the distance, a flaming carpet of orange and purple stretched almost to the summit of the brown hills of kindlier soil, and farther round, westwards, richly cultivated fields, from which the labourers seemed to hang like insects in the air, rolled away almost to the clouds.|$|E
6000|$|While Tip {{was still}} in his prime the family of {{children}} was further enriched by the possession of a goat; but this did not belong to the whole family, or it was, at least nominally, the property of that eldest brother they all looked up to. I do not know how they came by the goat, any more than I know how they came by Tip; I only know that there came {{a time when it was}} already in the family, and that before it was got rid of it was a presence there was no mistaking. Nobody who has not kept a goat can have any notion of how many different kinds of mischief a goat can get into, without seeming to try, either, but merely by following the impulses of its own goatishness. This one was a nanny-goat, and it answered to the name of Nanny with an intelligence that was otherwise wholly employed in making trouble. It went up and down stairs, from cellar to garret, and in and out of all the rooms, like anybody, with a faint, cynical indifference in the glance of its cold gray eyes that gave no hint of its purposes or performances. In the chambers it chewed the sheets and pillow-cases on the beds, and in the dining-room, if it found nothing else, it would do its best to eat the table-cloth. Washing-day was a perfect feast for it, for then it would banquet on the shirt-sleeves and stockings that dangled from the clothes-line, and simply glut itself with the family linen and cotton. In default of these dainties, Nanny would gladly eat a chip-hat; she was not proud; she would eat a split-basket, if there was nothing else at hand. Once she got up on the kitchen table, and had a perfect orgy with a lot of fresh-baked pumpkin-pies she found there; she cleaned all the pumpkin so neatly out of the pastry shells that, if there had been any more pumpkin left, they could have been filled up again, and nobody could have told the difference. The grandmother, who was visiting in the house at the time, declared to the mother that it would serve the father and the boys just right if she did fill these very shells up and give them to the father and the boys to eat. But I believe this was not done, and it was only suggested in a moment of awful exasperation, and because it was the father who was to blame for letting the boys keep the goat. The mother was always saying that the goat should not stay in the house another day, but she had not the heart to insist on its banishment, the children were so fond of it. I do not know why they were fond of it, for it never showed them the least affection, but was always taking the most unfair advantages of them, and it would butt them over whenever it got the chance. It would try to butt them into the well when they <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> pull up the bucket from the curb; and if it came out of the house, and saw a boy cracking nuts at the low flat stone the children had in the back-yard to crack nuts on, it would pretend that the boy was making motions to insult it, and before he knew what he was about it would fly at him and send him spinning head over heels. It was not of the least use in the world, and could not be, but the children were allowed to keep it till, one fatal day, when the mother had a number of other ladies to tea, as the fashion used to be in small towns, when they sat down to a comfortable gossip over dainty dishes of stewed chicken, hot biscuit, peach-preserves, sweet tomato-pickles, and pound-cake. That day they all laid off their bonnets on the hall table, and the goat, after demurely waiting and watching with its faded eyes, which saw everything and seemed to see nothing, discerned a golden opportunity, and began to make such a supper of bonnet-ribbons as perhaps never fell to a goat's lot in life before. It was detected in its stolen joys just as it had chewed the ribbon of a best bonnet up to the bonnet, and was chased into the back-yard; but, as it had swallowed the ribbon without being able to swallow the bonnet, it carried that with it. The boy who specially owned the goat ran it down in a frenzy of horror and apprehension, and managed to unravel the ribbon from its throat, and get back the bonnet. Then he took the bonnet in and laid it carefully down on the table again, and decided that it would be best not to say anything about the affair. But such a thing as that could not be kept. The goat was known at once to have done the mischief; and this time it was really sent away. All the children mourned it, and the boy who owned it the most used to go to the house of the people who took it, and who had a high board fence round their yard, and try to catch sight of it through the cracks. When he called [...] "Nanny!" [...] it answered him instantly with a plaintive [...] "Baa!" [...] and then, after a vain interchange of lamentations, he had to come away, and console himself as he could with the pets that were left him.|$|E
5000|$|On October 11, 1991, {{during a}} break from rehearsals for The Royal Family, he {{suffered}} a heart attack on the set. According to Della Reese, Foxx was about to have an interview with Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous; when she <b>leaned</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Foxx as he was on the ground, Foxx said, [...] "Get my wife" [...] repeatedly. [...] According to Joshua Rich at Entertainment Weekly, [...] "It was an end so ironic that for a brief moment cast mates figured Foxx - whose 1970s TV character often faked heart attacks - was kidding when he grabbed a chair and fell to the floor." [...] Foxx was taken to Queen Of Angels Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, where he died that evening at the age of 68. Foxx was posthumously given a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame on May 17, 1992. Foxx is buried in Las Vegas, at Palm Valley View Memorial Park. His mother, Mary Carson (1903-1993), outlived Foxx and died two years later, in 1993. She was buried just to the right of her famed son.|$|E
5000|$|Monk and Stottlemeyer {{eventually}} locate Murdoch's body. They {{find the}} keys {{they are looking}} for in a plastic bag containing Murdoch's personal effects. Just as Stottlemeyer grabs the keys and tells Monk that they've found Exhibit A, one of the [...] "corpses" [...] rises from its gurney and casts off the sheet. It is Peter Breen, who has followed Eddie Murdoch's body to the morgue to recover his keys and destroy the one remaining piece of evidence against him. Breen knocks Stottlemeyer out, and then handcuffs him to a gurney, then grabs a knife to prepare to kill Monk. He also manages to take Monk's cane. Monk grabs Stottlemeyer’s pistol, and with his eyesight beginning to return just in the nick of time, shoots Breen in the chest, then <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> check on Stottlemeyer, who realizes that Monk can see him.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{they set}} out for home, a queer party, for Franz rode on to tell the news; Dan and Toby led the way; then came Nan in the strong arms of Silas, who {{considered}} her [...] "the smartest little baggage he ever saw," [...] and teased her {{all the way home}} about her pranks. Mrs. Bhaer would let no one carry Rob but himself, and the little fellow, refreshed by sleep, sat up, and chattered gayly, feeling himself a hero, while his mother went beside him holding on to any pat of his precious little body that came handy, and never tired of hearing him say, [...] "I knew Marmar would come," [...] or seeing him <b>lean</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> kiss her, and put a plump berry into her mouth, [...] "'Cause he picked 'em all for her." ...|$|R
50|$|We {{then see}} Nicole {{in her black}} and peach bikini lying down on the sand. Her lover is filming her from above. Nicole then is seen semi nude, with her hands {{covering}} her breasts. Then she is seen playing around with her lover in the sea. They splash around and Nicole then is seen {{on the edge of}} the boat, in a blue dress. More semi nude appearances follow. But then we return to the bed, which was seen at the start. Nicole is now kneeling on top of her boyfriend, in her white bra and panties. She sings to him whilst he strokes her hips and touches the sides of her panties. She then <b>leans</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> kiss his cheek softly. He kisses her arm. The video ends with Scherzinger making one final semi nude appearance, covering her breasts with her hands. She giggles and the scene fades.|$|R
