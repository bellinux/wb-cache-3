5|$|In his {{combined}} works, Kant {{constructed the}} basis for an ethical law from the concept of duty. Kant began his ethical theory by arguing that the only virtue that can be unqualifiedly good is a good will. No other virtue has this status because every other virtue {{can be used to}} achieve immoral ends (the virtue of <b>loyalty</b> <b>is</b> not good if one is loyal to an evil person, for example). The good will is unique in that it is always good and maintains its moral value even when it fails to achieve its moral intentions. Kant regarded the good will as a single moral principle which freely chooses to use the other virtues for moral ends.|$|E

25|$|The {{editors of}} The Chicago Tribune, a {{newspaper}} that had supported Nixon, wrote, “He is humorless {{to the point of}} being inhumane. He is devious. He is vacillating. He is profane. He is willing to be led. He displays dismaying gaps in knowledge. He is suspicious of his staff. His <b>loyalty</b> <b>is</b> minimal.” The Providence Journal wrote, “Reading the transcripts is an emetic experience; one comes away feeling unclean.” This newspaper continued that, while the transcripts may not have revealed an indictable offense, they showed Nixon contemptuous of the United States, its institutions, and its people. According to Time magazine, the Republican Party leaders in the Western U.S. felt that while there remained a significant number of Nixon loyalists in the party, the majority believed that Nixon should step down as quickly as possible. They were disturbed by the bad language and the coarse, vindictive tone of the conversations in the transcripts.|$|E

Blake Solomon of AbsolutePunk found the album lacking in terms of instrumentals and songwriting saying, [...] "It's easy to see the great ideas from previous songs at work here, {{but there seems to}} be an intentional restraint placed on the band's likeable pop inclinations." [...] The Guardian criticized the album for its lackluster blues rock production and Willett's performance, saying [...] "his voice is too drearily clean-cut to deliver a true emotional punch." [...] Ian Cohen of Pitchfork felt that the album was hampered by the band's uninspired musicianship and songwriting and the hype surrounding them, saying that [...] "Proponents raved that Cold War Kids arrived fully formed, but as the band continues to stubbornly emphasize their weaknesses, Loyalty To <b>Loyalty</b> <b>is</b> proof that their detractors can say the same thing." ...|$|E

500|$|In , hope is {{suppressed}} by the dictatorship. As the Judge Advocate {{states in the}} novel, [...] "the President's first rule of conduct is never to give grounds for hope, and everyone must be kicked and beaten until they realise the fact". It {{can be argued that}} Camila represents hope in the novel because both her father and husband were able to persevere under the dictatorship by thinking of her; however, the President destroys this sense of hope with false stories. When the thought of her <b>loyalty</b> <b>is</b> eliminated, both her father and husband die because they have lost the hope of returning to her. Furthermore, Camila's happiness with her child and their escape to the countryside {{can be seen as the}} one glimpse of hope in an otherwise dark and disturbing ending. For critic Jean Franco, it is love that offers what little hope there is in the novel: [...] "The system is undermined only by lovethe love of an idiot for his mother, a woman trying desperately to save her husband from death." ...|$|E
