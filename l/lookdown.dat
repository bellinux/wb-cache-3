40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} about how to {{introduce}} complex technologies like arthroscopy into low-income countries. Thus, we compared low- versus high-resource intensive methods of teaching basic arthroscopic skills in a randomized controlled trial in Haiti. Methods: Forty-eight Haitian orthopaedic surgeons and residents attending an orthopaedic conference in Haiti were block randomized to receive instruction through a composite video (Control) or a composite video plus hands-on teaching with an expert visiting surgeon (Intervention). A low-fidelity surgical simulator tested visualization and triangulation skills. Participants completed a pre- and post-test where {{the goal was to}} sequentially tap the most numbers in 2. 5 minutes. Outcome metrics included highest tapped number, number of errors, visualization loss, and number of <b>lookdowns.</b> Multivariate linear regression was used to confirm randomization and compare outcomes between groups. Results: Seventy-five percent of initially randomized attendees participated with similar attrition rates between both groups. All participants who performed a pre-test completed a post-test. In terms of highest tapped number, treatment and control groups significantly improved compared to pre-test scores, with mean improvement of 3. 2 % (P= 0. 007) and 2. 2 % (P= 0. 03), respectively. Improvement between treatment and control groups was not statistically different (P= 0. 4). No statistically significant change was seen with regard to other metrics. Conclusion: We describe a protocol to introduce basic arthroscopic skills in a low-income country using a low-resource intensive teaching method. However, this method of learning may not be optimal given the failure to improve in all outcome measures...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Restrictions {{placed on}} the working hours of doctors {{over the past decade}} have {{resulted}} in substantial changes to the training and assessment of orthopaedic surgical residents. Many who are responsible for training the surgeons of the future have become concerned that this reduced clinical exposure is having a detrimental impact on technical skill acquisition. Consequently, {{there is a need for}} surgical educators to develop more objective methods for assessing surgical skill. The primary aim of this study was to determine whether a novel set of visual parameters assessing visuospatial ability, fine motor dexterity, and gaze control could objectively discriminate among various levels of arthroscopic experience. The secondary aim was to evaluate the correlations between these new parameters and previously established technical skill assessment methods. METHODS: Twenty-seven subjects were divided into a novice group (n = 7), a resident group (n = 15), and an expert group (n = 5) on the basis of arthroscopic experience. All subjects performed a diagnostic knee arthroscopy task on a simulator. Their performance was assessed with use of novel simple visual parameters that included the prevalence of instrument loss, triangulation time, and prevalence of <b>lookdowns.</b> Performance was also evaluated with use of previously validated technical skill assessment methods (a global rating scale and motion analysis). RESULTS: A significant difference in performance among the groups was demonstrated with use of all three novel visual parameters, the global rating scale, and motion analysis (p < 0. 05). There were strong and highly significant correlations (p < 0. 0001) between each of the novel parameters and the previously validated skill assessment methods. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the construct validity of three novel visual parameters for objectively assessing arthroscopic performance. These parameters are simple, can be used easily in the operating room, and are strongly correlated with current validated methods of technical skill assessment...|$|R
40|$|Following the BP Deepwater Horizon {{oil spill}} event, {{there was a}} {{critical}} need to assess {{the effects of the}} oil and dispersant chemicals on the coastal pelagic fish complex in the Gulf of Mexico and the Florida Straits. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine if spilled crude oil and dispersant chemicals have posed an ecological risk to the coastal pelagic fish complex through the detection of vitellogenesis. Crude oil containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), dispersant chemicals and other estrogen-mimicking compounds are suspected to induce vitellogenin production in male and immature female fish, normally only produced by sexually mature females. Blood plasma and surface mucus were collected from wild-caught adult and juvenile males and females from as many representative coastal pelagic species as possible (including yellowfin tuna Thunnus albacares and swordfish Xiphias gladius). To create a control for this experiment, crevalle jacks (Caranx hippos) and <b>lookdowns</b> (Selene vomer) were injected with estradiol- 17 β (10 μg/g body weight) into the peritoneal cavity to induce vitellogenesis, regardless of sex or reproductive stage. The mucus and blood plasma of each injected fish was collected 7 to 11 days post-injection. Mucus and blood plasma samples of wild-caught and experimentally-injected fishes were separated using sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, stained with a phosphoprotein specific fluorescent dye (Pro-Q Diamond®), and visualized through ultraviolet transillumination. Vitellogenin was visibly detectable in the mucus collected from the control-injected fish, suggesting a disruption in the endocrine system as a result of estrogen exposure (estradiol- 17 β). However, there were no elevated levels of vitellogenin detected in any wild-caught fish mucus or blood plasma samples, indicating no vitellogenesis. From this, we infer that there has been no detectable endocrine disruption to the sampled coastal pelagic fish complex in the Gulf of Mexico two years after the start of the spill...|$|R

50|$|The N001 radar for the Su-27 was {{designed}} by Viktor Grishin. Pushing {{the state of the}} art for the USSR, the original design, known as Mech, was supposed to draw heavily on technologies developed for the experimental Soyuz radar program led by NPO Istok. It was intended to have a great deal of commonality with the MiG-29's N019 Rubin radar. N001 has a 1.075m antenna diameter twist-cassegrain antenna. A pulse-doppler design operating in the 3 cm band utilising medium and high PRFs for optimum <b>lookdown</b> capability, the N001 has a search range of 80-100 km against a 3m m RCS target in a headon engagement, 140 km against a large bomber. It can track a 3m target at 65 km. In a pursuit engagement, search range for a 3m target falls to just 40 km. Azimuth limits are ±60. Initial units had a MTBF of only 5 hours, but later type is 100 hours; MTBF was eventually brought up to 200 hours.

50|$|There are {{a number}} of walks through the valley, with various entry, exit points and valley arms {{offering}} a range of permutations to explore. A moderate-grade day walk covering approximately 10 km in five hours starts at Perrys <b>Lookdown</b> and descends sharply to the valley floor. Crossing through a corner of the Blue Gum Forest, the track goes south through the Acacia Flat camp ground, following the Govetts Creek. Passing several abandoned campgrounds, the path forks at Junction Rock; the route to Govetts Leap was closed in October 2003, following a landslide, and was reopened in December 2007. In the other direction, along Govetts Creek, the route then starts a continuous climb towards the Grand Canyon, where it forks again; one track goes to Neates Glen, while the other is a steep climb to Evans Lookout. The general direction of travel is towards the southeast and this direction is recommended as the final climb at Evans Lookout is not as difficult as the ascent at Perrys <b>Lookdown.</b> Creeks in the valley are seasonal, the water is unsafe to drink. The walk is much more strenuous in summer due to the higher daily temperatures and the added risk of bushfires.|$|E

40|$|We review recent {{progress}} on ancestral processes related to mutation-selection models, {{both in the}} deterministic and the stochastic setting.

The pruned <b>lookdown</b> ancestral selection graph allows one to trace the ancestry of individuals from a stationary distribution back into the distant past, thus leading to the stationary distribution of ancestral types.

40|$|We study {{exchangeable}} coalescent {{trees and}} the evolving genealogical trees in models for neutral haploid populations.

We apply this representation to generalize the tree-valued Fleming-Viot process to include the case with dust in which the genealogical trees have isolated leaves. Using the Donnelly-Kurtz <b>lookdown</b> approach, we describe all individuals ever alive in the population model by a random complete and separable metric space, the <b>lookdown</b> space, which we endow with a family of sampling measures. This yields a pathwise construction of tree-valued Fleming-Viot processes. In the case of coming down from infinity, we also read off a process whose state space is endowed with the Gromov-Hausdorff-Prohorov topology. This process has additional jumps at the extinction times of parts of the population. In the case with only binary reproduction events, we construct the <b>lookdown</b> space also from the Aldous continuum random tree by removing the root and the highest leaf, and by deforming the metric in a way that corresponds to the time change that relates the Fleming-Viot process with a Dawson-Watanabe process.

40|$|Using Donnelly and Kurtz's <b>lookdown</b> construction, we {{prove that}} the Lambda-Fleming-Viot process with {{underlying}} Brownian motion has a compact support at any fixed time provided that the associated Lambda-coalescent comes down from infinity not too slowly. We also find both {{upper and lower bounds}} on Hausdorff dimension for the support at any fixed time. When the associated Lambda-coalescent has a nontrivial Kingman component, the Hausdorff dimension for the support is exactly two at any fixed time. For such a Lambda-Fleming-Viot process, we further prove a one-sided modulus of continuity result for the ancestry process recovered from Donnelly and Kurtz's <b>lookdown</b> construction. As an application, we can prove that its support process also has the one-sided modulus of continuity (with modulus function C√(tlog(1 /t))) at any fixed time. In addition, we obtain that the support process is compact simultaneously at all positive times, and given the initial compactness, its range is uniformly compact over time interval [0,t) for all t> 0. Under a mild condition on the Lambda-coalescence rates, we also find a uniform upper bound on Hausdorff dimension for the support and an upper bound on Hausdorff dimension for the range...|$|E
