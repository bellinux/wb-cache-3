500|$|Davies {{started writing}} the episode on 27 October 2007. He was several weeks behind {{schedule}} {{and had to}} decline an appearance at the National Television Awards four days later to hand the script in on time. He described writing the script as [...] "a <b>lot</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> rip through because it needs so much construction": he admitted that the opening scene could have been three times longer than his written version, itself longer than any opening scene he ever wrote. He was cautious that his script did not clash with Steven Moffat's two-part story [...] "Silence in the Library" [...] and [...] "Forest of the Dead"—then scheduled to be aired as the ninth and tenth episodes—because it also contained a parallel world. Davies was delayed due {{to the death of}} Howard Attfield, who portrayed Donna's father Geoff, and the difficulty of writing Rose's expository dialogue; he had to rush the script's ending to ensure it was ready to film. He finished the script on 2 November so the rest of the production team could prepare the episode for filming.|$|E
2500|$|Asher {{turned out}} to be more collaborative, and more on the same page with her musically, than any {{producer}} she had worked with previously. Ronstadt's professional relationship with Asher allowed her to take command and effectively delegate responsibilities in the recording studio. Although hesitant at first to work with her because of her reputation for being a [...] "woman of strong opinions (who) knew what she wanted to do (with her career)", he nonetheless agreed to become her full-time producer, and remained in that role through the late 1980s. Asher attributed the long-term success of his working relationship with Ronstadt to the fact that he was the first person to manage and produce her with whom there was a solely professional relationship. [...] "It must be a <b>lot</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> have objective conversations about someone's career when it's someone you sleep with", he said.|$|E
2500|$|Following its release, {{reviews of}} the Virtual Boy tended to praise its novelty, but {{questioned}} its ultimate purpose and longtime viability. The Los Angeles Times described gameplay as being [...] "at once familiar and strange." [...] The column praised the quality of motion and immersive graphics, but considered the hardware itself tedious to use and non-portable. A later column by the same reviewer found the system to be somewhat asocial, although it held out hope for the console's future. Reviewing the system shortly after its North American launch, Next Generation said, [...] "Unusual and innovative, the Virtual Boy {{can be seen as}} a gamble in the same way that the Game Boy was, but it's a <b>lot</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> see the VB succeeding to the same world-conquering extent that the Game Boy did." [...] They elaborated that while the sharp display and unique 3D effect are impressive, aspects such as the monochrome display and potential vision damage to young gamers severely limit the system's appeal. They added that the software library was decent, but failed to capitalize on Nintendo's best-selling franchises (Zelda and Metroid games were absent, and the Mario games were not in the same style as the series's most successful installments) and lacked a system seller to compare with the Game Boy's Tetris.|$|E

6000|$|All {{the rest}} of that night Peter sat under a {{friendly}} old bramble-bush {{on the edge of the}} Old Pasture and nursed the sore places made by the claws of Hooty the Owl. At last jolly, round, red Mr. Sun began to climb up in the blue, blue sky, just as he does every day. Peter looked up at him, and he felt sure that Mr. Sun winked at him. Somehow it made him feel better. The fact is, Peter was beginning to feel just a wee, wee bit homesick. It is bad enough to be in a strange place alone, but to be sore and to smart and ache as Peter did makes that lonesome feeling a whole <b>lot</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> bear. It is dreadful not to have any one to speak to, but to look around and not see a single thing you have ever seen before,--my, my, my, it certainly does give you a strange, sinking feeling way down inside! ...|$|E

It's a <b>lot</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> just write off people who are different from you when you see them every day and talk every day, and therefore find inevitable points of overlap (like breakfast food).

50|$|After {{reaching}} the summit, {{it was a}} <b>lot</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> go back up. St Kilda suffered a premiership hangover and missed the 1967 finals, then battled into fourth place for the 1968 finals. They only got there thanks to an eight-goal win over Geelong {{in the final round}} but, facing the same opposition in the semi final, lost by 44 points - a 92-point turnaround in a week. On the day, Stewart lowered his colours to West Australian Dennis Marshall, who dominated the game. Stewart was made captain for 1969, but the team could manage only seventh place and tension arose between the captain and his coach, Allan Jeans. Stewart resigned the position at season's end, then went missing for pre-season training.|$|E
50|$|Petreski joined Korean K-League side Pohang Steelers at the {{beginning}} of the 2001 season. He played in 25 of Pohang's 27 regular league season matches that year scoring eight times and finishing joint fifth top scorer in the league and top scorer at Pohang. In 2002 he netted nine times in 23 appearances, again top scorer at his club. He finally hit double figures in the 2003 season as he netted ten goals in 40 appearances but finished second-top Pohang goalscorer behind Woo Sung-Yong that year who hit fifteen. In the 2004 regular season he found goals a <b>lot</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> come by, scoring just once in 26 appearances as Pohang finished runners-up to Suwon Samsung Bluewings in that year's K-League Championship final.|$|E
50|$|The {{economic}} {{interdependence of}} nations {{has been studied}} extensively. Such an international economic interaction is commonly {{thought of as a}} dollar value of the transaction of goods and services between nations (Cooper), several academics have challenged this fundamental paradigm over time. Baldwin suggests that economic interdependence may be conceived as the opportunity costs incurred from potential exit costs that incur as a result of breaking existing economic ties between nations. Whitman, cited by Baldwin, further expands on Cooper's definition and proposes that economic interdependence should also involve the degree of sensitivity of a country’s economic behaviour to policies and development of countries outside its border. However, empirical evidence to support the latter definition is a <b>lot</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> find, given its ambiguity (Baldwin).|$|E

50|$|Bobby Jones {{was one of}} {{the most}} admired {{defenders}} ever to wear an NBA uniform; he was also considered one of the most virtuous. While most other players depended on the occasional thrown elbow, hip-check, or grab of the uniform to gain an advantage, Jones relied on hustle and determination. It was Jones’ stellar defense along with his other specialties such as leadership, that made him a standout sixth man. Opposing teams could ill afford to relax on defense when Jones came off the bench, and they also had <b>to</b> work a <b>lot</b> <b>harder</b> on offense <b>to</b> get the ball in or even near the basket.|$|R

Knutson did not play for the Packers in 1955 after suffering an injury in an exhibition game against the Washington Redskins. [...] His highest annual salary as a professional athlete was $8,000. [...] Knutson later recalled his days in the NFL as follows: [...] "It {{was more of a}} business - dog eat dog. When I played there were only 12 teams and the (roster) limit was 33.
