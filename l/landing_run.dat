5|$|The force {{tasked with}} assaulting the fort and {{capturing}} the three bridges was formed from {{elements of the}} 7th Air Division and the 22nd Airlanding Division, and was named Sturmabteilung Koch (Assault Detachment Koch) after {{the leader of the}} force, Hauptmann Walter Koch. The force, which had been assembled in November 1939, was primarily composed of parachutists from the 1st Parachute Regiment and engineers from the 7th Air Division, as well as a small group of Luftwaffe pilots. Although the force was composed primarily of parachutists, it was decided that the first landings by the force should be by glider. Adolf Hitler, who had taken a personal interest in the arrangements for the assault force, had ordered that gliders be used after being told by his personal pilot, Hanna Reitsch, that gliders in flight were nearly silent; it was believed that, since Belgian anti-aircraft defences used sound-location arrays and not radar, {{it would be possible to}} tow gliders near to the Dutch border and then release them, achieving a surprise attack as the Belgian defenders would not be able to detect them. Fifty DFS 230 transport gliders were supplied for use by the assault force, and then a period of intensive training began. A detailed study of the fort, the bridges and the local area was made, and a replica of the area was constructed for the airborne troops to train in. Joint exercises between the parachutists and the glider pilots were carried out in the early spring of 1940, and a number of refinements made to the equipment and tactics to be used, such as barbed wire being added to the nose-skids of the gliders to reduce their <b>landing</b> <b>run,</b> and the airborne troops trained with flamethrowers and specialized explosives, the latter of which were so secret that they were only used on fortifications in Germany and not on fortifications in Czechoslovakia similar to Fort Eben Emael. Secrecy was also maintained in a number of other ways. When exercises were completed gliders and equipment would be broken down and taken away in furniture vans, the sub-units of the force were frequently renamed and moved from one location to another, unit badges and insignia were removed, and the airborne troops were not permitted to leave their barracks or to take leave.|$|E

Soyuz 11 lifted off 6 June, docked with the station, and {{completed}} the program, but the crew was killed by decompression on their <b>landing</b> <b>run.</b> Kamanin was at the mission control at Eupatoria throughout their fatal descent and left his own transcript of conversation and the silence that followed.|$|E
25|$|When Caproni had {{completed}} initial testing, the Regia Aeronautica {{took control of}} the plane and transferred it to Guidonia Montecelio for a brief series of further test flights. All test pilots reported that the plane was extremely stable in flight, {{to the point where it}} was difficult to change course; test pilots were also astounded by the very low landing speed and the consequently very short <b>landing</b> <b>run.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>Land</b> <b>Run</b> of September 16, 1893 {{was known}} as the Cherokee Strip <b>Land</b> <b>Run.</b> It opened 8,144,682.91 acres (12,726 square miles or about 3.3 million hectares) to settlement. The land was {{purchased}} from the Cherokees. It was the largest <b>land</b> <b>run</b> in U.S. history, four times larger than the <b>Land</b> <b>Run</b> of 1889. The Cherokee Strip Regional Heritage Center museum at the eastern edge of Enid, Oklahoma commemorates this event.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Land</b> <b>Run</b> of 1893, {{also known}} as the Cherokee Outlet Opening or the Cherokee Strip <b>Land</b> <b>Run,</b> marked the opening to {{settlement}} of the Cherokee Outlet in Oklahoma's fourth and largest <b>land</b> <b>run.</b> It was part of what would later become the U.S. state of Oklahoma in 1907.|$|R
50|$|The {{settlement}} {{that took place}} in September 1891 included three <b>land</b> <b>runs.</b> On September 22, 1891, a <b>land</b> <b>run</b> was held to settle Iowa, Sac and Fox, Potawatomi, and Shawnee lands. A September 23, 1891, <b>land</b> <b>run</b> was held to settle Tecumseh, the predesignated location of the county seat of County B, later renamed as Pottawatomie County. Finally, on September 28, 1891, a <b>land</b> <b>run</b> was held to settle Chandler, the predesignated location of the county seat of County A, later renamed as Lincoln County.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{fitted with}} a retractable tricycle undercarriage with steerable nosewheels, allowing a fairly large crab angle during cross-wind landing. The reverse pitch control with which the aircraft is fitted allows the constant-speed mechanism to be manually overridden to reverse the blade pitch angle, thus providing excellent ground-handling characteristics, helping {{to slow down the}} plane to shorten the <b>landing</b> <b>run.</b> This control also allows the aircraft to back up on its own during taxiing.|$|E
25|$|The F28 {{was similar}} in design to the British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven and Douglas DC-9, {{as it had}} a T-tail and engines mounted {{at the rear of}} the fuselage. The {{aircraft}} had wings with a slight crescent angle of sweep with ailerons at the tip, simple flaps, and five-section liftdumper only operated after landing to dump the lift. These were employed rather than reverse thrust as the designers felt that doing so not only reduced weight, but maintenance also. Having no reversers also meant that on unpaved airstrips there was less chance of the engines ingesting debris. The leading edge was fixed (although one experimental model had leading edge slats and these were offered as an option) and was anti-iced by bleed air from the engines. The tail cone could split and be hydraulically opened to the sides to act as a variable air brake – also used on the contemporaneous Blackburn Buccaneer. This design was also used on the HS-146, which became the BAe-146. The design is unique in that it not only slows the aircraft down rapidly, it can aid in rapid descents from economic cruising altitudes and also allowed the engines to be set at higher RPM which helped eliminate 'lag time'. This means the engines respond faster if needed for sudden speed increases or go-arounds on the approach to landing. The Fellowship had a retractable tricycle landing gear which used large low pressure tyres enabling the use of unpaved airstrips. Large wheel brakes also helped in shortening the <b>landing</b> <b>run.</b>|$|E
500|$|On 13 June 1943, {{the pilots}} of No.79 Squadron {{continued}} on their journey north, arriving at Garbutt airfield in Queensland. At approximately 14:00, Brennan landed his Spitfire {{in the wake}} turbulence of the aircraft ahead of himself and touched down {{on the left side}} of the runway. Brennan was informed that he was cutting in on the path of the Spitfire following him, which was to land on the right side of the runway. Brennan landed his aircraft short, and at the conclusion of his <b>landing</b> <b>run</b> turned across the path of the second Spitfire. In the ensuing collision, Brennan sustained severe injuries and was rushed to hospital; he died before arrival. Described as one with [...] "an easy-going nature, an engaging sense of humour and... loyal to his friends", Brennan was buried in Townsville War Cemetery.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Land</b> <b>Run</b> of September 22, 1891, {{opened the}} Iowa, Sac and Fox, Potawatomi, and Shawnee lands to settlement. The <b>land</b> <b>run</b> opened 6,097 plots of 160 acre each of former {{reservation}} land. On the following day, a <b>land</b> <b>run</b> {{was held to}} settle Tecumseh, the pre-designated location of the county seat of County B, later renamed as Pottawatomie County. On September 28, 1891, another <b>land</b> <b>run</b> was held to settle Chandler, the pre-designated location of the county seat of County A, later renamed as Lincoln County.|$|R
50|$|In 1895, {{after the}} Kickapoo finally consented to allotment, the final Oklahoma <b>Land</b> <b>Run</b> {{occurred}} on 23 May 1895. The <b>Land</b> <b>Run</b> of 1895 was {{the smallest of}} Oklahoma's five <b>land</b> <b>runs,</b> with approximately 10,000 participants. Because of {{the large number of}} contested claims and the problems with Sooners the remaining two land openings in Oklahoma were lotteries.|$|R

500|$|Ultra {{intercepts}} {{had put the}} British on alert. However, {{a series}} of mistakes and bad luck enabled the Germans to evade detection. Three Lockheed Hudsons of Coastal Command conducted a patrol at three positions. The first, named [...] "Stopper", [...] maintained surveillance between sunset and first light off the port of Brest. The Second, [...] "Line SE" [...] watched due north of the port, and the third, [...] "Habo", covered the area between Le Havre and Boulogne. The patrols lasted between 01:00 hours to dawn on 11 February. At 19:25 on the 11 February, [...] "Stopper" [...] took off as usual but was intercepted by a Bf 110 night fighter of NJG 1. The Hudson evaded the Bf 110, but its ASV equipment was unserviceable. The aircraft headed back to St. Eval, landing at 20:40. Its replacement headed over the same area, reaching the location at 22:38. It was too late, during the interlude, Ciliax and his ships had slipped their moorings. The “Line SE” Hudson should have picked up the German fleet, but in a repeat incident the ASV failed at 20:55. At 21:50 all attempts to repair it failed, and the Hudson returned to base. No replacement took its place. Everything now depended on [...] "Habo", but Ciliax’s luck held. At dawn, mist began to form over the airfield at Thorney Island. The mist was threatening to deny a clear <b>landing</b> <b>run</b> for the Hudson, so it was recalled one hour early, just as the German ships were approaching [...] "Habo’s" [...] zone. II./NJG 1 flew 19 sorties, protecting the ships during the night, until replaced by JG 2 at 08:00.|$|E
500|$|At {{the moment}} of touchdown, the spoiler lever was in the [...] "ARMED" [...] position. According to the system logic of the A320's flight controls, {{in order for the}} {{spoilers}} to automatically deploy upon touchdown not only must the spoiler lever be in the [...] "ARMED" [...] position, but both thrust levers must be at or close to the [...] "idle" [...] position. The FDR transcript shows that immediately after the warning, the flight computer recorded the left thrust lever being retarded to the rear-most position, activating the thrust reverser on the left engine, while the right thrust lever (controlling the engine with the disabled thrust reverser) remained in the CL position. One theory put forth by CENIPA is that the pilots may not have noticed that the right engine remained at CL because the Airbus autothrottle system, unlike other aircraft manufacturers, does not automatically move the levers when the autothrust controller changes engine settings. Therefore, the pilots may have thought that the right engine was at idle power without realizing that Airbus autothrust logic dictates that, when {{one or more of the}} thrust levers is pulled to the idle position, the autothrust is automatically disengaged. Thus, when the pilot pulled the left engine thrust lever to idle, it disconnected the autothrust system and the computer did not retard the right engine power to idle. The A320's spoilers did not deploy during the <b>landing</b> <b>run,</b> as the right thrust lever was above the [...] "idle" [...] setting required for automatic spoiler deployment. Since the right engine thrust lever was still in the [...] "climb" [...] detent at that time, the right engine accelerated to climb power while the left engine deployed its thrust reverser. The resulting asymmetric thrust condition resulted in a loss of control and a crash ensued.|$|E
2500|$|The {{competition}} proper, {{starting the}} next day awarded points on performance in four different tests: high speed, low speed, distance required to take off and clear an obstacle and length of <b>landing</b> <b>run.</b> [...] The total time in the air during the competition was also logged.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Land</b> <b>run</b> (sometimes [...] "land rush") usually {{refers to}} a {{historical}} event in which previously restricted land of the United States was opened to homestead on a first-arrival basis. Lands were opened and sold first-come or by bid, or won by lottery, or by means other than a run. The settlers, {{no matter how they}} acquired occupancy, purchased the land from the United States Land Office. For former Indian lands, the Land Office distributed the sales funds to the various tribal entities, according to previously negotiated terms. The Oklahoma <b>Land</b> <b>Run</b> of 1889 was the most prominent of the <b>land</b> <b>runs</b> while the <b>Land</b> <b>Run</b> of 1893 was the largest. The opening of the former Kickapoo area in 1895 was the last use of a <b>land</b> <b>run</b> in the present area of Oklahoma.|$|R
5000|$|The town lies in an {{area that}} in 1803 was part of the Louisiana Purchase. [...] After the Organic Act of 1890 recreated the area as Oklahoma Territory, present-day Canadian County was {{designated}} as County Four and settled by non-Indian settlers through the <b>Land</b> <b>Run</b> of 1889, the <b>Land</b> <b>Run</b> of 1892, and a 1901 land lottery. [...] The <b>Land</b> <b>Run</b> of 1892 opened up the surplus Cheyenne-Arapaho lands to non-Indian settlement, which opened up Calumet.|$|R
50|$|There {{were many}} {{other forms of}} this process, such as <b>Land</b> <b>runs</b> {{including}} the <b>Land</b> <b>Run</b> of 1889, in Oklahoma, which occurred when parts of the territory of Oklahoma were first opened, allowing anyone to claim land on a first-come, first-serve basis.|$|R
2500|$|It {{occupied}} [...] of a [...] site {{acquired by}} the Corporation for aviation and sports use under the Blackpool Improvement Act 1928. The aerodrome was completed, licensed and opened for use in August 1929. After the erection in early 1931 of a hangar and a clubhouse and offices with an observation/control tower on top, the aerodrome was officially opened on 2 June 1931 by the Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. The all-grass airfield's surface was small with the longest <b>landing</b> <b>run</b> available (NW/SE) being [...] in length.|$|E
2500|$|The F.E.2a {{was quickly}} {{followed}} by the main production model, the F.E.2b, again powered by a Beardmore, initially of 120hp - later F.E.2bs received the 160hp (119kW) model. The air brake of the [...] "a" [...] was ineffective in its intended function of reducing the <b>landing</b> <b>run</b> and was omitted. A total of 1,939 F.E.2b were built, {{only a few of}} them at the Royal Aircraft Factory, as most construction was by private British manufacturers such as G & J Weir, Boulton & Paul Ltd and Ransomes, Sims & Jefferies.|$|E
2500|$|The Venture was {{a further}} {{development}} of the Vixen II {{to meet the requirements}} of Air Ministry Specification 45/23, six aircraft being ordered. The Venture, like the Vixen which formed its basis, was a single-bay biplane with a steel tube fuselage and wooden wings. It used the wings of the Vixen II with the lengthened fuselage of the Vixen III. The first Venture flew at the Vickers factory at Brooklands on 3 June 1924, being sent to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at Martlesham for evaluation. While demonstrating what was said to be [...] "docile" [...] handling, further testing showed that the aircraft had poor longitudinal stability, had a long <b>landing</b> <b>run</b> and was considered too large for use in army cooperation, where it would be expected to operate out of small airstrips. While it underwent brief service trials with No. 2 Squadron, the six Ventures were relegated to experimental purposes, the final aircraft being struck off charge in January 1933.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Land</b> <b>Run</b> itself {{began at}} noon on September 16, 1893, with an {{estimated}} 100,000 participants hoping to stake claim to part of the 6 million acres and 40,000 homesteads on what had formerly been Cherokee grazing land. It would be Oklahoma's fourth and largest <b>land</b> <b>run.</b>|$|R
50|$|The final <b>land</b> <b>run</b> in Oklahoma was the <b>Land</b> <b>Run</b> of 1895 {{to settle}} the Kickapoo <b>lands.</b> Each <b>run</b> had {{exhibited}} many problems and the Federal Government deemed the run to be an inefficient way to distribute land to would-be settlers. After 1895, the government distributed land by sealed-bid auctions. Major openings by this method included Kiowa-Comanche-Apache Reservation (1901), the Wichita-Caddo Reservation (1901), and the Big Pasture (1906).|$|R
50|$|In 1890, the Jerome Commission {{negotiated}} with the tribes of the area such that they agreed to allotment of their reservation lands, except for the Kickapoo. Indian lands were allotted to individual tribal members and the excess were opened to white settlement in the <b>Land</b> <b>Run</b> of 1891. A separate <b>land</b> <b>run</b> was held later that year for the townsite of the predesignated county seat, Chandler. Lincoln County was organized and designated as County A. In 1895, the Kickapoo agreed to allotment and the land was claimed by settlers during the <b>Land</b> <b>Run</b> of 1895.|$|R
2500|$|The {{empennage}} of the Type D {{was supported}} {{on a pair}} of girders arranged parallel to one another in plan. The upper girder members were attached to the upper wing spars at the tops of the innermost interplane struts and the lower ones ran under the lower wing, mounted on downward extensions of the inner interplane struts. The mounting was strengthened with two diagonal struts on each side, one {{from the base of the}} forward interplane strut to the upcurved tip of the lower member and the other from the rear interplane strut to the junction of the lower member and its first vertical cross member. [...] Each of these lower members, which supported the aircraft on the ground as skids, carried twin, rubber sprung landing wheels. Behind the wing the upper and lower members converged to the rear; the drag on the lower members reduced the <b>landing</b> <b>run.</b> There were three vertical cross braces on each girder but the only lateral inter-girder cross-members were near the tail, though there was wire bracing. The broad chord tailplane was mounted a little below the upper girder member with a pair of round-cornered rectangular rudders above it.|$|E
2500|$|The {{empennage}} of {{the type}} F was supported {{on a pair of}} girders arranged parallel to one another in plan. The upper girder members were attached to the upper wing spars at the tops of the innermost interplane struts and the lower ones ran under the lower wing, mounted on inverted W-form struts {{from the bottom of the}} inner interplane pairs. These lower members, which supported the aircraft on the ground as skids, each carried twin, rubber sprung landing wheels. Behind the wing the upper and lower members converged to the rear, the drag on the lower members reducing the <b>landing</b> <b>run.</b> [...] There were three vertical cross braces on each girder but the only lateral inter-girder cross-members were near the tail, though there was wire bracing. The broad chord, roughly rectangular, warping tailplane was mounted just below the upper girder member. Above it and instead of the earlier rectangular rudders there was a pair of small triangular fins, each mounting a broad rudder with a gently rounded leading edges and a straight, vertical trailing edge. The fins were separated by about one third of the tailplane span.|$|E
