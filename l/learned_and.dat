50|$|The {{role of a}} Community <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> {{development}} worker is largely different from {{the role of a}} formal educator such as a teacher. Community <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> {{development worker}}s do not follow a curriculum, as they allow the people they work with to form their own way of <b>learning</b> <b>and</b> each individual is believed {{to have the ability to}} reach their full potential in life.

5|$|Blois died on 10 May 1206, and {{was buried}} in Lincoln Cathedral. In the early fourteenth century, he was still remembered well by the cathedral chapter and was {{described}} as <b>learned</b> <b>and</b> kindly by the 14th century writer John Schalby, who wrote a work {{on the lives of}} the bishops of Lincoln. Besides his kinsman William de Blois, another known relative was a nephew, William de Marum. Marum succeeded his uncle as rector in Durham. He was once identified with another William of Blois, who was a poet and the brother of Peter of Blois, but there is no evidence supports that identification.|$|E
5|$|Hunter recalls being pleasantly {{surprised}} to learn that Russ Tamblyn and Richard Beymer had been cast as regular characters in the series, having enjoyed the early work of both actors during the 1950s and 1960s. Tamblyn improvised elements of his performance, including a magic trick involving two golf balls, which was something he had <b>learned</b> <b>and</b> wished to include during his role in the episode. The character of Gordon Cole, first played by Lynch in this episode as a voice in a telephone call, was conceived as being hard of hearing; this was because Lynch liked the idea of delivering his lines in a loud voice, and worked backwards to establish a reason for this. Engels wrote most of Cole's dialogue over the series, having had experience with his own mother being similarly hard of hearing.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, she {{returned}} to India {{in the wake of}} the economic recession and moved to Mumbai to stay with Priyanka. During a visit to Yash Raj Films studio, Priyanka (who was filming for Pyaar Impossible!) introduced Parineeti to the head of the public relations team of the company. Chopra obtained an internship in the marketing department, joining the production company as a public-relations consultant. She considered it a perfect job, because she could use what she had <b>learned</b> <b>and</b> work in films. Chopra had disliked actors and acting; to her, the profession seemed like an excuse to wear too much makeup. This changed when she observed Priyanka's preparations for her role in 7 Khoon Maaf (2011), which highly influenced her and changed her perception towards acting and actors. Once she learnt more about filmmaking, her respect for the profession increased.|$|E

5|$|Youth {{spend too}} much time {{learning}} what their teachers think is important, irrelevant from what the youth may already know. The manager of learning value allows the youth to learn and practice his skills in situations simulating real life. The Manager of Learning methodology first exposes the learner to a situation to help both the learner and the leader assess his current state of knowledge. This causes the learner to internalize a need to improve his knowledge or skills. This is followed by a period of teaching or exposure during which the participant improves from their base-line knowledge. The participant then gets a chance to apply what he has <b>learned,</b> <b>and</b> lastly, evaluates his performance improvement.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, Raziel {{discovers the}} Oracle's Cave, where Moebius the Time Streamer once hid the Chronoplast, a magical time machine. Raziel {{traverses}} the caves and finds Kain in the Chronoplast's control room. Raziel is angered {{over what he}} has <b>learned,</b> <b>and</b> Kain says his actions are justified due to his being subject to destiny, before proceeding to inform Raziel that the Sarafan were far from the noble crusaders that Raziel believes them to be when the latter demands to know why he created him, which Raziel refuses to listen to. Raziel attacks Kain while the latter continues to adjust the Chronoplast's controls. Although Raziel eventually gains an advantage, the Chronoplast activates, and Kain escapes through a time portal, beckoning Raziel to follow. Raziel complies, ignoring warnings from The Elder God. As the game ends, Raziel emerges from the timeslip and is greeted by Moebius, leading into the events of Soul Reaver 2.|$|E
5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is common}} amongst spiders, both in luring prey and stealthily {{approaching}} predators. One {{case is the}} golden orb weaver (Nephila clavipes), which spins a conspicuous golden colored web in well-lit areas. Experiments show that bees are able to associate the webs with danger when the yellow pigment is not present, as occurs in less well-lit areas where the web is much harder to see. Other colors were also <b>learned</b> <b>and</b> avoided, but bees seemed least able to effectively associate yellow pigmented webs with danger. Yellow {{is the color of}} many nectar bearing flowers, however, so perhaps avoiding yellow is not worth while. Another form of mimicry is based not on color but pattern. Species such as Argiope argentata employ prominent patterns {{in the middle of their}} webs, such as zigzags. These may reflect ultraviolet light, and mimic the pattern seen in many flowers known as nectar guides. Spiders change their web day to day, which can be explained by bees' ability to remember web patterns. Bees are able to associate a certain pattern with a spatial location, meaning the spider must spin a new pattern regularly or suffer diminishing prey capture.|$|E

5|$|At {{the center}} of the massive ship, V'Ger is {{revealed}} to be Voyager 6, a 20th-century Earth space probe believed lost. The damaged probe was found by an alien race of living machines that interpreted its programming as instructions to learn all that can be <b>learned,</b> <b>and</b> return that information to its creator. The machines upgraded the probe to fulfill its mission, and on its journey the probe gathered so much knowledge that it achieved consciousness. Spock realizes that V'Ger lacks the ability to give itself a focus other than its original mission; having learned what it could on its journey home, it finds its existence empty and without purpose. Before transmitting all its information, V'Ger insists that the Creator come in person to finish the sequence. Realizing that the machine wants to merge with its creator, Decker offers himself to V'Ger; he merges with the Ilia probe and V'Ger, creating a new form of life that disappears into another dimension. With Earth saved, Kirk directs Enterprise out to space for future missions.|$|E
5|$|He also gains {{the ability}} to constrict objects and enemies with a band of energy, {{although}} this feature {{was one of the}} few abilities not to feature in future games. Players can find an ancient relic that gives Raziel the power to fire bolts of telekinetic energy, which cause little damage by themselves but can knock enemies into hazards and push objects from a distance. Baptism in holy flame can transform the Soul Reaver into the Fire Reaver, which can set enemies aflame and adds fire to Raziel's telekinetic bolts. Players can also find magical glyphs that allow Raziel to expend magical energy to attack groups of enemies simultaneously. These glyphs typically involve vampire weaknesses such as sunlight, fire, water, or sound, as well as additions such as telekinetic force (available well before the normal telekinesis becomes available) and the causing of earthquakes to temporarily stun enemies. Glyphs are acquired through finding glyph altars, specific locations in Nosgoth where the skills can be <b>learned,</b> <b>and</b> solving a puzzle before being granted the magical ability. However, Raziel begins the game with access to the 'Shift' glyph, granting {{the ability to}} shift between the material and spectral planes, with no glyph altar necessary.|$|E
5|$|But {{although}} the Sermons of Swift are deficient in eloquence, and were lightly esteemed by their author, {{they must not}} be undervalued by the modern reader. They exhibit, in an eminent degree, that powerful grasp of intellect which distinguished the author above all his contemporaries. In no religious discourses can be found more sound good sense, more happy and forcible views of the immediate subject. The reasoning is not only irresistible, but managed in a mode so simple and clear, that its force is obvious to the most ordinary capacity. Upon all subjects of morality, the preacher maintains {{the character of a}} rigid and inflexible monitor; neither admitting apology for that which is wrong, nor softening the difficulty of adhering to that which is right; a stern stoicism of doctrine, that may fail in finding many converts, but leads to excellence in the few manly minds who dare to embrace it. In treating the doctrinal points of belief, (as in his Sermon upon the Trinity,) Swift systematically refuses to quit the high and pre-eminent ground which the defender of Christianity is entitled to occupy, or to submit to the test of human reason, mysteries which are placed, by their very nature, far beyond our finite capacities. Swift considered, that, in religion, as in profane science, there must be certain ultimate laws which are to be received as fundamental truths, although we are incapable of defining or analysing their nature; and he censures those divines, who, in presumptuous confidence of their own logical powers, enter into controversy upon such mysteries of faith, without considering that they give thereby the most undue advantage to the infidel. Our author wisely and consistently declared reason an incompetent judge of doctrines, of which God had declared the fact, concealing from man the manner. He contended, that he who, upon the whole, receives the Christian religion as of divine inspiration, must be contented to depend upon God's truth, and his holy word, and receive with humble faith the mysteries which are too high for comprehension. Above all, Swift points out, with his usual forcible precision, the mischievous tendency of those investigations which, while they assail one fundamental doctrine of the Christian religion, shake and endanger the whole fabric, destroy the settled faith of thousands, pervert and mislead the genius of the <b>learned</b> <b>and</b> acute, destroy and confound the religious principles of the simple and ignorant.|$|E
