25|$|In 1973, an {{infantry}} {{group and}} some <b>logistical</b> <b>troops</b> were {{pulled out of}} Cyprus at short notice {{to serve in the}} Sinai desert between Egypt and Israel as part of the UN force that supervised the ceasefire that ended the Yom Kippur War.|$|R
5000|$|Q Battery: Q Battery was the regimental headquarters, {{which also}} {{included}} <b>logistical</b> <b>troops</b> attached with the 19th Field Regiment. Unlike {{the other three}} batteries, there was no central location for organizing Q Battery. This {{is largely due to}} many soldiers and officers being transferred and promoted as the war went on.|$|R
25|$|In March, Bundy {{began to}} urge the use of ground forces—American air {{operations}} alone he counseled would not stop Hanoi's aggression against the South. Johnson approved an increase in <b>logistical</b> <b>troops</b> of 18,000 to 20,000, the deployment of two additional Marine battalions and a Marine air squadron, in addition to planning for the deployment of two more divisions—and most importantly a change in mission from defensive to offensive operations; nevertheless, he disobligingly continued to insist {{that this was not}} to be publicly represented as a change in existing policy.|$|R
50|$|This {{was nearly}} {{impossible}} for <b>logistical</b> reasons. Turkish <b>troops</b> were deserting freely, and when Enver visited Beirut in June 1917 soldiers {{were forbidden to}} be stationed along his route for fear {{that he would be}} assassinated, and lack of rolling stock meant that troops were often detrained at Damascus and marched south.|$|R
50|$|In the new colony, {{the role}} of colonial {{storekeeper}} was a key position within the quickly expanding colonial administration. The colonial storekeeper's responsibility was to support the colonial administration with its <b>logistical</b> needs. Imperial <b>troops</b> in New Zealand were {{the responsibility of the}} Board of Ordnance, with who no doubt Tucker had a close working relationship.|$|R
5000|$|When the Spanish-American War began, the 2nd Cavalry Regiment was {{stationed}} in Kansas, Colorado, and New Mexico and assembled together in Georgia, {{the first time the}} entire regiment had been together since the Civil War. The troopers and horses of Troops A, C, D, and F boarded transports in Mobile, Alabama and set sail for Cuba, {{while the rest of the}} regiment traveled overland to Tampa, Florida. Due to a lack of transports, they served as <b>logistical</b> <b>troops,</b> and helped load units like Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders onto their ships. [...] These four troops quickly found that they were the only horse-mounted cavalry units in Cuba, and soon began working for General William Rufus Shafter. Joining Teddy Roosevelt and the Rough Riders, the 2nd Cavalry fought at the Battle of El Caney, the Battle of San Juan Hill, the Battle of the Aguadores, and the Siege of Santiago. During the armistice period, the women and children of Santiago were sent out of the city and into American lines to a camp in El Caney. D Troop was in charge of feeding and policing these 22,000 refugees. B Troop was committed to the Puerto Rican Campaign in July and August 1898, but illness forced them to return to the US. In January 1899, the entire regiment began pacification duty in Cuba where they remained for three years, facilitating public education and improving the island's sanitation.|$|R
5000|$|From 1942 until 1945, Cape Peron was {{the site}} of the [...] "K" [...] Battery complex, one of a chain of coastal gun emplacements {{defending}} the Perth region between Swanbourne in the north and Cape Peron in the south. [...] "K" [...] Battery was established as part of Australian coastal defences in 1942 following the fall of Singapore to the Axis powers and the imminent threat of invasion of Australia by Japanese forces. This chain of gun emplacements was colloquially named [...] "Fortress Fremantle" [...] and included sites at both Rottnest Island and Garden Island. During World War II, Fremantle was not only the Allied forces' largest submarine base in the southern hemisphere, it was also an important <b>logistical</b> port, <b>troop</b> station and location for ship repairs.|$|R
50|$|Obregón {{chose the}} site of battle, arrived in advance to prepare it and kept to his {{defensive}} strategy, knowing Villa's propensity for blind cavalry charges over an open field. Villa’s defeat {{was the result of}} his multiple tactical miscalculations and overconfidence in his much larger, undefeated army's ability to best Obregón’s army under any circumstances. Villa's División del Norte outnumbered Obregón's Constitutionalists 2:1, but Obregón had lured Villa far from his communication and supply lines to a field with existing canals and trenches. Obregón was able to utilize many tactical innovations from the Western Front in the First World War—namely trenches, barbed wire and machine guns—in the defense. Villa continued his use of massed cavalry charges. New <b>logistical</b> and <b>troop</b> movement techniques {{such as the use of}} trains were seen.|$|R
25|$|The {{mission of}} the 347th Regional Support Group is to deploy and provide {{contingency}} and expeditionary base operations, with responsibilities for managing facilities, providing administrative and <b>logistical</b> support for <b>troop</b> services and ensuring the security of personnel and facilities on a base camp. The brigade provides command and control of assigned units during homeland security, homeland defense and other civil support missions within the U.S. to include managing the reception, staging, onward movement and integration of supporting forces.|$|R
25|$|Ranjit Singh {{changed and}} {{improved}} {{the training and}} organisation of his army. He reorganised responsibility and set performance standards in <b>logistical</b> efficiency in <b>troop</b> deployment, manoeuvre, and marksmanship. He reformed the staffing to emphasise steady fire over cavalry and guerrilla warfare, improved the equipment and methods of war. The military system of Ranjit Singh combined {{the best of both}} old and new ideas. He strengthened the infantry and the artillery. He paid the members of the standing army from treasury, instead of the Mughal method of paying an army with local feudal levies.|$|R
5000|$|Whereas von Lettow {{armed and}} trained African Askaris {{to create an}} {{effective}} guerrilla force able to live off the land; the British attempted to deploy Indian Army troops under General Smuts and keep the King's African Rifles as internal security troops, with limited success. Not only were they unused to the terrain, the need to feed {{a large body of}} foreign soldiers presented severe <b>logistical</b> problems, as <b>troops</b> in the interior had to be supplied over long distances without rail or road lines of communication. To deliver one kilogram of rice to the interior it could take 50 kilograms of rice at the coast—most of it being consumed en route to feed all the porters needed to carry it inland.|$|R
25|$|The chief {{problems}} which Fourteenth Army would face were <b>logistical.</b> The advancing <b>troops</b> {{would need to}} be supplied over crude roads stretching for far greater distances than were ever encountered in Europe. Although expedients such as locally constructed river transport and temporary all-weather coverings for roads (made from coarse hessian sacking material impregnated with bitumen and diesel oil) were to be used, transport aircraft were to be vital for supplying the forward units. Disaster threatened as early as 16 December 1944, when 75 American transport aircraft were abruptly transferred to China, where the Japanese Operation Ichi-Go was threatening American airfields. Although aircraft were hastily transferred from the Mediterranean theatre to replace those despatched to China, continuing threats to deprive Fourteenth Army of the support of American transport aircraft were to be a constant concern for Slim during the forthcoming battles.|$|R
5000|$|Early in {{the morning}} of October 26, the huge Japanese fleet was spotted by Yi's scouts as they {{deployed}} around the small bay on the southern end of Myeongnyang strait. Admiral Yi's fleet then redeployed out of their base in Usuyeong to block the northern end of the strait. [...] Yi described about [...] "...200 enemy ships... flowing the strait" [...] and at least 133 ships in his immediate vicinity. It is estimated that at least 133 ships were combat warships and at some 200 ships immediately behind were <b>logistical</b> (supply and <b>troop</b> carrying) support ships. In Japanese records, the ships at the front of their formations were the middle class warships called Seki-bune, as the Japanese fleets by this time understood the devastating offensive capabilities of the main Korean warships which were near the strait.|$|R
50|$|The Sikh Khalsa Army (Punjabi: ਸਿੱਖ ਖਾਲਸਾ ਫੌਜ, Persian:سیک ارتش خالصا-ارتش لاهور), {{also known}} as the Army of Lahore, Punjab Army, Khalsa or simply Sikh Army was the {{military}} force of the Sikh Empire. It was formed in 1799 with the capture of Lahore by Ranjit Singh. From then on the army was modernised on Franco-British principles. It was divided in three wings: the Fauj-i-Khas (elites), Fauj-i-Ain (regular force) and Fauj-i-Be Qawaid (irregulars). Due to the lifelong efforts of the Maharaja and his European officers, it gradually became a prominent fighting force of Asia. Ranjit Singh changed and improved the training and organisation of his army. He reorganized responsibility and set performance standards in <b>logistical</b> efficiency in <b>troop</b> deployment, manoeuvre, and marksmanship. He reformed the staffing to emphasize steady fire over cavalry and guerrilla warfare, improved the equipment and methods of war. The military system of Ranjit Singh combined the best of both old and new ideas. He strengthened the infantry and the artillery. He paid the members of the standing army from treasury, instead of the Mughal method of paying an army with local feudal levies.|$|R
