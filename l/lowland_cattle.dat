25|$|The {{predominant}} {{farm type}} in Devon is livestock farming, which includes dairy, <b>lowland</b> <b>cattle,</b> and sheep farms. In 2006, the {{total labour force}} on Devon farms was 23,240 people, with around 7,953 employed full-time. The majority of land within the biosphere reserve is farmland, which helps support the local economy, but is not designated with statutory protection. The reserve is therefore managed carefully {{with the cooperation of}} farmers and landowners; as the boundaries of the reserve are the catchment areas of the River Taw and River Torridge, extra precaution must be taken in protecting water supplies from nonpoint source pollution. Rainwater can accumulate residues of fertilisers, especially nitrates and phosphates. Once leached into the rivers they can affect the river ecology through eutrophication, causing damage to plants and animals. This {{is one of the most}} pervasive water quality problems in Europe. Pathogens excreted by animals can also directly affect humans when transported by rainwater to rivers and the sea where people swim. Another problem is river sedimentation caused by fine soil particles washing from the land into rivers, this causes high rates of mortality in fish eggs and can affect fish feeding habits. The Biosphere Reserve Partnership provides support to farms that encourage sustainable practices, benefit the environment, and have a good role within the community.|$|E
30|$|While {{farmers who}} stopped practising forest grazing {{generally}} chose to replace their mountain cattle with {{larger and more}} productive <b>lowland</b> <b>cattle,</b> those who continued with forest grazing generally did not. The main reason was that farmers who kept up the tradition of forest pasturing remained dependent on the mountain cattle breed's adaptiveness to its environment. Other reasons listed by the farmers interviewed were that mountain cattle milk is more suitable for home-made cheese production owing to its higher fat content, while <b>lowland</b> <b>cattle</b> is ideal as drinking milk and suits those farmers delivering milk to commercial dairies. Some simply argued that mountain cows are more beautiful, more trustworthy or have gentler ways or a more independent and intriguing mind. This attachment of farmers to their cows deserves some attention, as {{it is important to}} understand their reasons for continuity and resistance to change in their farming practices.|$|E

First, it discusses the technology-deforestation link in six different types of cases: developed countries, commodity booms, shifting cultivation, permanent upland (rainfed) agriculture, irrigated (<b>lowland)</b> agriculture, and <b>cattle</b> production. Next, it returns to the hypotheses presented in the book, and discusses the key conditioning factors in the technology-deforestation link. A number of factors determine the outcome. Among those, labour market effects and migration are critical in {{a majority of the}} cases. Another critical effect is that new technologies can help relax farmers' capital constraints, which may lead to higher or lower deforestation depending on how they invest their additional funds. The scale of adoption and the policy context are also critical conditioning factors...|$|R
40|$|High-altitude {{pulmonary}} hypertension (HAPH) has heritable features {{and is a}} major cause of death in cattle in the Rocky Mountains, USA. Although multiple genes are likely involved in the genesis of HAPH, to date no major gene variant has been identified. Using whole-exome sequencing, we report the high association of an EPAS 1 (HIF 2 a) double variant in the oxygen degradation domain of EPAS 1 in Angus cattle with HAPH, mean pulmonary artery pressure 450 mmHg in two independent herds. Expression analysis shows upregulation of 26 of 27 HIF 2 a target genes in EPAS 1 carriers with HAPH. Of interest, this variant appears to be prevalent in <b>lowland</b> <b>cattle,</b> in which 41 % of a herd of 32 are carriers, but the variant may only have a phenotype when the animal is hypoxemic at altitude. The EPAS 1 variant will be a tool to determine the cells and signalling pathways leading to HAPH...|$|E
40|$|Lowlands in Ethiopia cover {{about 60}} {{percent of the}} total land area, of which about 60 percent is arid. Land use in the {{lowlands}} is dominated by pastoralist and agropastoralist production systems. Livestock production constitutes the most important component of the system and rangeland is the major source of feed. Lowland breeds of livestock {{play an important role in}} the national economy of Ethiopia. For example, by the mid 1980 s, 90 {{percent of the total}} export of live animals was comprised of lowland breeds of cattle and sheep. <b>Lowland</b> <b>cattle</b> also contributed about 20 percent of the draft animals in the highlands. The International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), and its predecessor, the ILCA has conducted research on pastoral and agropastoral production systems in Ethiopia for more than a decade. These studies focused on the Borana plateau of southern Ethiopia, the Jijiga area in eastern Ethiopia and other places. This paper draws on studies carried out by ILRI and presents results on vegetative dynamics and resource use, livestock management, socio-economic contributions and constraints, and policy issues related to the Development of pastoral systems. Appropriate attention to the pastoral and agropastoral systems should remain an important focus of future agricultural Development strategies...|$|E

In this study, we cloned and characterized the genes encoding IGF- 1 and IGFBP- 1 to improve the current knowledge on their roles in highland Bos grunniens (Yak). We also compared their expression levels in the liver and kidney tissues between yaks and <b>lowland</b> <b>cattle.</b> We obtained full-length 465 bp IGF- 1 and 792 bp IGFBP- 1, encoding 154 amino acids (AA) IGF- 1, and 263 AA IGFBP- 1 protein, respectively using reverse transcriptase-polyerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technology. Analysis of their corresponding amino acid sequences showed a high identity between B. grunniens and lowland mammals. Moreover, the two genes were proved to be widely distributed in the examined tissues through expression pattern analysis. Real-time PCR results revealed that IGF- 1 expression was higher in the liver and kidney tissues in B. grunniens than in Bos taurus (p< 0. 05). The IGFBP- 1 gene was expressed at a higher level in the liver (p< 0. 05) of B. taurus than B. grunniens, but it has a similar expression level in the kidneys of the two species. These results indicated that upregulated IGF- 1 and downregulated IGFBP- 1 are associated with hypoxia adaptive response in B. grunniens...|$|E
50|$|The Diemtigen {{area was}} {{inhabited}} during the Bronze Age and possibly during the Mesolithic Era. It was permanently inhabited and fortified by the High Middle Ages. The heights above the valleys {{are home to}} several castles or castle ruins. No records exist and very {{little is known about}} the ruins of Kronegg Castle, above Eggwald, and Grafenstein Castle, above Oey. The third castle, Hasenburg near Diemtigen was first mentioned in 1257 as castrum de Diemtingen and in the 12th and 13th centuries was the seat of the Freiherr von Strättligen. After the 12th century the castle and lands passed through several noble families until the Bernese von Scharnachtal family acquired it and in 1439 sold it to the city of Bern. A set of laws and privileges were granted to the villagers of the entire valley in 1361 and again in 1393. In 1649 the laws governing the entire valley were codified. Beginning in the 15th century passes from the Diemtigen valley into Adelboden, Lenk and Zweisimmen opened up local trade. By the 16th century, the villagers in the valley bought grain from the <b>lowlands,</b> raised <b>cattle</b> in alpine meadows and then exported the cattle over the passes. While a little silver and coal were found in the mountains, there was never enough to support mines. Due to limited farmland and poverty, many residents left the valley. Before the 19th century it was into mercenary service, while after 1800 they emigrated to North America, Germany or Russia. Following the 1798 French invasion, Diemtigen became part of the Helvetic Republic Canton of Oberland. With the Act of Mediation in 1803 it returned to the Canton of Bern.|$|R

A fundamental aim of this work is to assess the financial performance of organic farms differentiated by farm type, in order to inform DEFRA policy-making with respect to economics of organic farming, {{and to provide a}} basis for assessments by farmers, advisers and other interested parties of the farm-level implications of conversion to and continued organic farming. This research area builds on previous economics work on organic farming carried out by IRS, UWA (Project OF 0190, covering 1995 / 961 to 1998 / 992). Here, data is shown for the 2001 / 02 financial year, which is {{the first of a series}} of three reports covering the financial performance of organic farm types including cropping, horticulture, lowland and LFA dairy, <b>lowland</b> and LFA <b>cattle</b> and sheep and mixed farming systems for 2001 / 02 up to 2003 / 04. In comparison with the earlier reports, there has been a significant improvement in the numbers of farms for which data have been obtained. Summarised and detailed financial input, output, income, liabilities and assets and some physical performance measures are presented based on current Farm Business Survey data collection and collation guidelines. The samples of organic farms per robust farm type are sufficiently large to give a reasonable level of confidence in the data; however, it should be noted that the organic farm samples are not statistically representative of their type, although the results can be seen as a reasonable indication of farm income levels for organic farms. An additional element of this work is the inclusion of comparable conventional farm data for the farm types shown. Each organic farm within this study was matched with the averaged results for a comparable cluster of conventional farms based on the resource endowment of individual organic farms. Broadly speaking, the parameters used to select comparable farm clusters included farm type, FBS region, LFA status, utilisable agricultural area, milk quota holding (where applicable) and farm business size. For each farm type, the results for each cluster were averaged and compared with the average for the individual organic farms. Overall, organic farms showed a similar or higher level of net farm income for all farm types compared to the conventional farms. The greatest differences were seen in the cropping, horticulture, LFA dairy and mixed farm types. Both organic and conventional lowland dairy types performed similarly. For management and investment income, only the organic <b>lowland</b> and LFA <b>cattle</b> and sheep farms showed a negative value. Conversely, the comparable conventional farm types showed a negative value with the exception of the lowland dairy farms. Gross margin data is presented for organic dairy herds including the top and bottom 5 performing herds. Cattle and sheep gross margins are shown for lowland and LFA farm types in addition to breeding pig gross margins. Crops shown include winter and spring wheat and barley, spring oats, beans and potatoes and a further five horticultural crops...|$|R
40|$|The {{principle}} aim of {{the studies}} reported within this thesis was to quantify and compare methane emissions from beef cattle consuming upland vegetation and lowland vegetation. Within this remit, methods to estimate intake and methane emissions were evaluated and the data acquired through these methods were used to contextualise the estimated methane emissions against levels of intake and animal performance. Cattle grazing upland vegetation were found to produce greater absolute amounts of methane (g/d) than those consuming <b>lowland</b> vegetation, but <b>cattle</b> consuming <b>lowland</b> vegetation had greater DM intakes and body-weight gains. There {{was no significant difference}} in methane g/kg DMI between cattle grazing upland and lowland vegetation. The studies indicated that DM intake is a significant driver of methane production by beef cattle. There were significant differences in methane emissions (when expressed as g/kg DMI) between housed cattle offered upland and lowland vegetation but any difference between vegetation types ceased to be significant when methane was expressed as g/kg digestible DMI. However, cattle consuming upland vegetation had significantly greater methane emissions per unit of BWG (kg/d) than <b>cattle</b> consuming <b>lowland</b> pasture. This study has shown that a modified l 1 -alkane protocol (incorporating once-daily alkane dosing and once-daily faecal sampling) can be used to reliably estimate DM intake by grazing beef cattle. Across all of the studies conducted, there were no breed (suckler vs dairy origin) differences between cattle for DM intake, absolute methane emissions, bodyweight- gains or methane emissions expressed as % of gross energy intake. The study reinforced the usefulness of GPS collars when used in conjunction with vegetation measurements, maps, and visual observations to monitor animal distribution, grazing behaviour and identify the diet selection by cattle grazing on heterogeneous upland pastures. Strategies to mitigate methane emissions from grazing cattle on the upland are currently limited and require further investigation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

The aim of the report is to collate financial data for organic farms differentiated by farm type, {{in order to provide}} continuity between previous studies (project code: OF 0190) on the economics of organic farming covering years 1995 / 96 to 1998 / 99 and new research work carried out by the Institute of Rural Sciences, UWA, to obtain financial information for organic farms for the period 2001 / 02 to 2003 / 04 (project code: OF 0189). The financial data in this report were not collected directly, but were derived from other DEFRA-funded studies. Data are from farms of varied sizes within the samples for each farm type and not always of adequate sample size. This was particularly the case for horticulture while other datasets mainly comprised five farms or more per farm type. A cautious approach is required when viewing smaller farm samples as {{it is not possible to}} draw conclusions on the organic sector from these results; but may permit observation of data trends for the particular set of farms within the sample. Where possible, to provide an idea of economic trends over time, continuous farm data for 1998 / 99 and in some cases for 2001 / 02 are shown alongside the 1999 / 00 and 2000 / 01 data. The report highlights results for organic cropping, horticulture, dairy, lowland and LFA cattle and sheep farms and one set of results for in-conversion dairy farms. Comparable conventional farm datasets are shown alongside some organic datasets for comparison. This was the case for both organic and in-conversion dairy farms and LFA and <b>lowland</b> <b>cattle</b> and sheep farms for 2000 / 01 datasets only. From this report, the financial data show that most farm types under organic management had positive net farm incomes (NFI) with the exception of the in-conversion dairy farm sample. Management and investment incomes (MII) were positive values for all farm types with the exception of lowland and LFA cattle and sheep farms from the FBS sample.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{results from}} research work carried {{out for the}} Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) on the financial performance of organic farms in 1998 / 99. The {{aim of the research}} was to assess the financial performance of organic farms differentiated by farm type, in order to inform MAFF policy-making with respect to organic farming, and to provide a basis for assessments by farmers, advisers and other interested parties of the farm-level implications of conversion to and continued organic farming. To provide an idea of the trends over time, where possible data for continuous samples of farms are presented for 1997 / 98 and 1998 / 99. The specific objectives of this project OF 0190 were to extend the previous project (OF 0125, covering 1995 / 96 to 1997 / 98) to collect and collate data on the financial performance of organic farms, differentiated by farm type 1. This was achieved through the collation of financial data collected under three different MAFF-funded research projects supplemented by data collected on other farm types. The samples of organic farms are small because of the limited number of organic holdings over 8 ESU (European Size Units) with identifiable holding numbers in 1996, when the previous study was started. As the sample is small there is limitation on how the results may be extrapolated to the wider population of organic farms, especially as the structure and objectives of those converting to organic production in the late 1990 s may be different from those that converted in the 1970 s and 1980 s. Detailed financial input, output, income, liabilities and assets and some physical performance measures are presented for 1998 / 99. Where an identical sample of five farms is available, data are presented for 1997 / 98 and 1998 / 99 for the sample. The organic farm samples are so small that outliers (especially larger farms) have a large influence on the average. If the samples were larger, general trends would be more apparent and less influenced by individual farms; despite this, some explanation has been attempted of trends and changes in inputs, outputs and incomes. However, great care must be taken in extrapolating results. Of those farm types for which a continuous identical sample of five farms was available, Net Farm Incomes (NFI) increased for cropping (£ 281 /ha) and dairy farms (£ 487 /ha) in 1998 / 99 compared with 1997 / 98; in both cases outputs as well as inputs increased between years. Mixed farms showed an average reduction in outputs and increase in inputs, lowering the average NFI to £ 15 /ha in 1998 / 99. The five <b>lowland</b> <b>cattle</b> and sheep farms improved a negative NFI of £ 161 /ha in 1997 / 98 to a positive £ 7 /ha in 1998 / 99 through an increase in livestock outputs with a similar level of inputs to that of 1997 / 98. Due to the high level of farmer and spouse labour on horticultural holdings, the average Management and Investment Income (MII) of the sample was negative, but the average NFI was £ 1, 836 /ha. On four holdings, 1998 / 99 average outputs were 92...|$|E
40|$|In the report, {{we present}} results of {{research}} on the financial performance of organic farms in 2006 / 07 carried out for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). The main aim of this work is to assess the financial performance of organic farms differentiated by farm type, in order to inform Defra policy-making with respect to economics of organic farming, and to provide a basis for assessments by farmers, advisers and other interested parties of the farm-level implications of conversion to and continued organic farming. This research builds on previous work on the economics of organic farming carried out at Aberystwyth University (Projects OF 0190, covering 1995 / 96 to 1998 / 99 and OF 0189, covering 1999 / 00 to 2004 / 05). In this report, financial data are shown for the 2005 / 06 and 2006 / 07 financial years, including between year comparisons and comparisons with similar conventional farms. For this report only, it has not been possible to produce identical samples for all farm types due to the change in data collection approach between 2005 / 06 and 2006 / 07. Identical sample comparisons have only been possible for lowland dairy and lowland and LFA cattle and sheep systems. The identical farm samples comprise farms that are present in both the 2005 / 06 and 2006 / 07 datasets. The total number of organic farms for 2006 / 07, also referred to as the full farm sample data, is shown alongside the identical datasets. In the other cases, data for the full samples in 2005 / 06 and 2006 / 07 are presented, but comparisons should be treated with caution due to changes in sample composition. Summarised and detailed financial input, output, income, returns to labour and capital, liabilities and assets and some physical performance measures are presented based on current Farm Business Survey (FBS) data collection and collation guidelines. The full samples of organic farms per robust farm type are sufficiently large to give some reasonable level of confidence in the data although {{it should be noted that}} the organic farm samples are not statistically representative of their type. However, the results can be seen as a reasonable indication of farm income levels for comparable organic and conventional farms. Smaller farm samples should be treated more cautiously as there is a possibility for outliers (especially larger farms) to have a significant influence on the average results. An additional element of this work is the inclusion of comparable conventional farm data (obtained from the main FBS sample) for the farm types shown. Each organic farm within this study was matched with an appropriate cluster of conventional farms based on the resource endowment indicators for individual organic farms. The indicators included farm type, FBS region, Less Favoured Area (LFA) status, utilisable agricultural area (UAA), milk quota held (where applicable) and farm business size. The cluster farm data were averaged for each farm type to derive the comparable conventional farm (CCF) data based on the organic farms from the identical and full farm samples. The identical samples of organic farms showed a much higher level of net farm incomes for lowland dairy and <b>lowland</b> <b>cattle</b> and sheep in 2006 / 07 than in 2005 / 06, with LFA cattle and sheep showing a small decrease over the period. Overall, organic net farm incomes exceeded conventional in all sectors, with most sectors showing an organic NFI twice that of the comparative conventional NFI. Increased organic prices and only small cost increases have led to substantial increases in organic NFI, especially in the livestock sectors...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} carried out in Bonke Woreda of Gamo Gofa Zone, {{southern}} Ethiopia, with the objectives of assessment of fattening and marketing system, and effect of concentrate supplementation with locally available feeds on fattening performance of indigenous cattle. The study involved survey to assess cattle fattening and marketing practices, and action research to evaluate the effect of homemade concentrate from locally available feed resources on fattening performance and economic return of indigenous cattle. The survey part involved interviewing 120 households purposively selected from six kebeles in three agro ecologies. Focus group discussions and key informants have been employed to enrich the data. The feeding trial was conducted in Danible Ottora Kebele,with 18 (9 castrate and 9 non – castrate) indigenous cattle for 70 days excluding adaptation period of 15 days. Treatments included farmer’s practices alone (T 1); T 1 + concentrate supplementation at 1 % of body weight (T 2); and T 1 + concentrate supplementation at 1. 5 % of body weight (T 3). Maize stover and stubble grazing was provided as a basic ration which was the farmers feeding practice. Experimental animals were blocked by farms/households and randomly assigned to three feeding treatments separately. Heart girth and body condition score were recorded while body weight was estimated from heart girth using regression equation developed for zebu cattle. The data were analyzed using the General Linear Model Procedure of statistical package for Social Science (SPSS 16). The result showed that the most dominant cattle breed used for fattening in the study area was indigenous. The major source of cattle for fattening was through purchasing from market (69. 1 %) followed by raising at home (24. 2 %). Almost all fatteners in highland (95 %) and mid-altitude (100 %) were engaged in fattening castrate. Concerning physiological stage of the fattening animals, most of the producers (83 %) use matured & old oxen. In highland, majority of the farmers fatten cattle once within a year (60 %), while it was three times per year for mid-altitude (42. 5 %) and two times per year for lowland (70 %) agro-ecologies. The majority (90 %) {{of the respondents indicated that}} the most common criteria used to decide fattening period was body condition of the animals. Majority of the respondents in the highland, mid altitude and <b>lowland</b> fatten <b>cattle</b> for six months, three months and five months, respectively. The major types of feed resources for the fattening animal were natural pasture, crop residues, stubble grazing, grass hay and feed supplements. The major criteria used while purchasing fattening cattle included frame size, heath, body condition, coat color and price of animals. The experience in cattle fattening, large cattle population, diverse & suitable agroecology, availability of crop residues, high irrigation potential, initiation of the introduction of improved forage species and cheap labor force reveals the potential of the area for improved cattle fattening. However, feed shortage, shortage of land, prevalence of disease, poor access for credit service and marketing information, and underdeveloped cattle marketing were the major constraints that hinder the performance of cattle fattening. The feeding trial showed that average daily gain were highest (p< 0. 05) for animals supplemented with T 3 followed by T 2 and T 1. Similarly, the net return was higher (P< 0. 05) for the supplemented group (T 2 & T 3) compared to non-supplemented group kept under farmers management (T 1). Among the supplemented groups, marginal rate of return was higher for animals supplemented with T 2 compared to T 3. Thus, it can be concluded that when resources are not meager smallholders producers could use supplementation at 1. 5 % of body weight for higher return. However, when resources are limited producers are advised to supplement at 1 % of body weight for higher marginal rate of return. Detail research work on availability, nutrient composition and digestibility of the major feed resource are recommended for further work. Global Affairs Canad...|$|R

As the sample is small there is limitation on how the results may be extrapolated to the wider population of organic farms, especially as the structure and objectives of those converting to organic production in the late 1990 s may be different from those that converted in the 1970 s and 1980 s. Detailed financial input, output, income, liabilities and assets and some physical performance measures are presented for 1998 / 99. Where an identical sample of five farms is available, data are presented for 1997 / 98 and 1998 / 99 for the sample. The organic farm samples are so small that outliers (especially larger farms) have a large influence on the average. If the samples were larger, general trends would be more apparent and less influenced by individual farms; despite this, some explanation has been attempted of trends and changes in inputs, outputs and incomes. However, great care must be taken in extrapolating results. Of those farm types for which a continuous identical sample of five farms was available, Net Farm Incomes (NFI) increased for cropping (£ 281 /ha) and dairy farms (£ 487 /ha) in 1998 / 99 compared with 1997 / 98; in both cases outputs as well as inputs increased between years. Mixed farms showed an average reduction in outputs and increase in inputs, lowering the average NFI to £ 15 /ha in 1998 / 99. The five <b>lowland</b> <b>cattle</b> and sheep farms improved a negative NFI of £ 161 /ha in 1997 / 98 to a positive £ 7 /ha in 1998 / 99 through an increase in livestock outputs with a similar level of inputs to that of 1997 / 98. Due to the high level of farmer and spouse labour on horticultural holdings, the average Management and Investment Income (MII) of the sample was negative, but the average NFI was £ 1, 836 /ha. On four holdings, 1998 / 99 average outputs were 92...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} the third {{from a series of}} four {{economic}} reports on organic farm incomes from 2001 / 02 through to 2004 / 05. The work was carried out by Organic Research Group at the Institute of Rural Sciences, UWA on the economic performance of organic farms in 2003 / 04 on behalf of DEFRA Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. A fundamental aim of this work is to assess the financial performance of organic farms differentiated by farm type, in order to inform DEFRA policy-making with respect to economics of organic farming, and to provide a basis for assessments by farmers, advisers and other interested parties of the farm-level implications of conversion to and continued organic farming. This research area builds on previous economics work on organic farming carried out by Institute of Rural Sciences, UWA (Project OF 0190, covering 1995 / 96 to 1998 / 99). Here, time series data are shown using an identical farm analysis technique for the 2002 / 03 and 2003 / 04 financial years covering the economic performance of seven organic farm types including cropping, horticulture, lowland and LFA dairy, lowland and LFA cattle and sheep and mixed farming systems. The identical farm samples comprise farms that are present in both 2002 / 03 and 2003 / 04. The total number of organic farms for 2003 / 04, also referred to as the full farm sample data, is shown alongside the identical datasets for 2003 / 04. Summarised and detailed financial input, output, income, returns to labour and capital, liabilities and assets and some physical performance measures are presented based on current Farm Business Survey (FBS) data collection and collation guidelines. The full samples of organic farms per robust farm type are sufficiently large to give some reasonable level of confidence in the data; however, {{it should be noted that}} the organic farm samples are not statistically representative of their type, although they can be seen as a reasonable indication of farm income levels for comparable organic and conventional farms. Smaller identical farm samples should be treated more cautiously as there is a possibility for outliers (especially larger farms) to have some influence on the average results. An additional element of this work is the inclusion of comparable conventional farm data for the farm types shown. Each organic farm within this study was matched with an appropriate cluster of conventional farms based on the resource endowment identifiers/variables of individual organic farms. Broadly speaking, the identifiers/variables included farm type, FBS region, Less Favoured Area (LFA) status, utilisable agricultural area (UAA), milk quota holding (where applicable) and farm business size. The cluster farm data were averaged for each farm type to derive the comparable conventional farm (CCF) data based on the organic farms from the identical and full farm samples. Overall, the identical sample of organic farms showed a similar or higher level of net farm income for all farm types in 2003 / 04 than in 2002 / 03. On comparing the organic data with the comparable conventional data, the greatest differences in performance were seen in the LFA dairy and <b>lowland</b> <b>cattle</b> and sheep farm types where organic farms performed significantly better in 2003 / 04. LFA cattle and sheep farm types performed similarly to the comparable conventional farm samples. The full sample datasets compared similarly to the identical datasets for both organic and conventional farms in 2002 / 03. Gross margin data are presented for organic dairy herds on a herd size and top five performing herd basis. Cattle and sheep gross margins are shown for lowland and LFA farm types. Crops shown include winter and spring wheat, triticale, spring barley, spring and winter oats, beans, ware potatoes, sugar beet, leeks, early potatoes, winter broccoli, cauliflower and cabbage crops. Where applicable, 2002 / 03 gross margin data are shown alongside the 2003 / 04 data. Benchmarking data are shown for milk, suckler store, finishing beef and lamb production enterprises...|$|E
