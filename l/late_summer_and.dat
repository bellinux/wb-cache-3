5|$|By {{the time}} the American first leg was well underway, there was {{speculation}} of more American dates {{to come in the}} <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> fall, but E Street guitarist Nils Lofgren said that Springsteen and wife Patti Scialfa would make a decision later on.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} August 2005, with work on both {{platforms}} and the intermediate tower occurring {{through the summer}} of that year. The bulk of the construction occurred in 2006.

5|$|Galiella rufa is a {{saprobic}} species, {{and grows}} either solitarily, but more usually in groups or in clusters on decaying hardwood branches and logs. The fungus fruits in <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> autumn. The fungus {{has been noted}} to fruit readily on logs used for the cultivation of the shiitake mushroom. The fruit bodies are readily overlooked as they blend in with their surroundings.|$|E

5|$|Hurricanes (or their remnants) {{occasionally}} track {{through the}} area in <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> early fall, but are often weak {{by the time they}} reach Washington, partly due to the city's inland location. Flooding of the Potomac River, however, caused by a combination of high tide, storm surge, and runoff, has been known to cause extensive property damage in the neighborhood of Georgetown.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{are readily}} {{propagated}} from seed. As seed {{is surrounded by}} irritating hairs within the pod, extraction requires care. Stem cuttings of semi-mature growth can be taken in <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> require the application of rooting hormones and bottom heat.|$|E
5|$|Suillus americanus is {{a common}} species, and is found growing solitarily or in {{clusters}} on the ground throughout northeastern North America, north to Canada, where it typically fruits in the <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> autumn. It {{is also found in}} Guangdong, China, an example of a disjunct distribution. Fruit bodies can often be found in drier weather when other species are not abundant.|$|E
50|$|The Amtkeli is fed by snow, {{rain and}} groundwater. Floods occur in <b>late</b> spring <b>and</b> <b>summer,</b> <b>and</b> the low flows occur in winter.|$|R

5000|$|It {{is located}} 10 km away from Tanakpur. Banbasa {{is known for}} the Banbasa Barrage and Dam across the [...] Sharda river, its canal and what many {{consider}} the launching point for the trip up into the mountains on the Holy Purnagiri Pilgrimage. The place abounds in sugarcane, paddy, wheat, mango orchards etc. and has a hot and humid climate, typical of the Terais, during summers, with heavy rains in <b>late</b> <b>summers</b> <b>and</b> hard winters.|$|R
5|$|This sparrow is awkward {{in flight}} and {{primarily}} uses running and hopping to move. The rufous-crowned sparrow will at times forage in pairs during the breeding season, and in family-sized flocks in <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> early autumn. During the winter they can occasionally {{be found in}} loose mixed-species foraging flocks.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2007, Carey began hosting game shows, {{beginning}} with his April selection {{as host of}} the CBS game show pilot Power of 10. The show ran from August 7, 2007 to April 7, 2008 and aired twice weekly during the <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> early fall. Each game featured contestants predicting how a cross-section of Americans responded to questions covering {{a wide variety of}} topics in polls conducted by CBS.|$|E
5|$|However, off northeastern Brazil, {{the female}} {{reproductive}} cycle is short enough to occur annually. Vitellogenesis (the formation of yolk within the ovary) {{occurs in the}} <b>late</b> <b>summer,</b> <b>and</b> is immediately followed by mating and fertilization in the fall, with the young being born the following spring to summer. The seasonality of these events means the reproductive cycle is offset by six months between populations in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The gestation period has been variously estimated at eight months off northeastern Brazil and 911 months off the southeastern United States.|$|E

5|$|Mistle thrushes {{are found}} as {{individuals}} or pairs {{for much of}} the year, although families forage together in <b>late</b> <b>summer,</b> <b>and</b> groups may merge to form flocks of several tens of birds; {{it is not uncommon for}} up to 50 thrushes to feed together at that time of year. They roost at night in trees or bushes, again typically as individuals or pairs, but with families roosting together in autumn.|$|E
5|$|Mycena cinerella is a {{saprobic}} fungus, and derives nutrients by decomposing {{leaf litter}} and similar detritus, converting it to humus and mineralizing organic {{matter in the}} soil. The fruit bodies grow in groups on needles under pine and Douglas fir, typically in the <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> autumn. In the United States, it has been collected from Michigan, Washington, Oregon, and California. In Europe, {{it has also been}} collected from the Great Britain, Norway, Poland, and Sweden.|$|E

5|$|On 14 August, Colonel David E. Lownds {{took over}} as {{commander}} of the 26th Marine Regiment. There were sporadic actions in the vicinity during the <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> early fall, the most serious {{of which was the}} ambush of a supply convoy on Route 9. This proved to be the last overland attempt at resupply for Khe Sanh until the following March. During December and early January there were numerous sightings of NVA troops and activities in the Khe Sanh area, but the sector remained relatively quiet.|$|E
5|$|Peniophora quercina {{typically}} grows upon dead wood, {{which can}} {{be attached to the}} tree or fallen, where it causes white rot. It favours oak, but can also be found on other deciduous trees, such as beech. P.quercina is known to be a pioneer species on dead wood, which means it can be the first species to grow. It is found in Europe, where it is very common. Though it can be encountered all year, it produces spores in <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> autumn. It has also been recorded in Amur, in eastern Asia.|$|E
5|$|Suillus brevipes grows singly, scattered, or {{in groups}} {{on the ground in}} <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> autumn. A common—and {{sometimes}} abundant—mushroom, it occurs over most of North America (including Hawaii), south to Mexico, and north to Canada. This species has been found in Puerto Rico growing under planted Pinus caribaea, where it is thought to have been introduced inadvertently from North Carolina by the USDA Forest Service in 1955. Other introductions have also occurred in exotic pine plantations in Argentina, India, New Zealand, Japan, and Taiwan.|$|E
