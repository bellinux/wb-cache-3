The <b>Line</b> <b>Mode</b> Browser was very popular in the {{beginning}} of the web, since it was the only web browser available for all operating systems. Statistics from January 1994 show that Mosaic had quickly changed the web browser landscape and only 2% of all World Wide Web users browsed by <b>Line</b> <b>Mode</b> Browser. The new niche of text-only web browser was filled by Lynx, which made the <b>Line</b> <b>Mode</b> Browser largely irrelevant as a browser. One reason was that Lynx is much more flexible than the <b>Line</b> <b>Mode</b> Browser. It then became a test application for the libwww.|$|E

50|$|Example: Given {{an eight}} scan <b>line</b> ANTIC <b>Mode</b> (Text Modes 2, 4, or 6) with the VS bit set on two {{adjacent}} <b>Mode</b> <b>lines</b> the scrolling region then {{consists of three}} <b>Mode</b> lines—the third <b>line</b> in the scrolling region is the first <b>Mode</b> <b>line</b> encountered without the VS bit set. When Vertical scrolling is not set in the Display List the three <b>Modes</b> <b>lines</b> would naturally result in 24 displayed scan lines. When the VS bits are set in the Display List Mode instructions as described and the VSCROL value is set to 2 then the first <b>Mode</b> <b>line</b> in the region begins displaying at scan line 2 showing scan lines 2 to 7 (six scan lines or 8 - VSCROL), the second <b>Mode</b> <b>line</b> is displayed completely (eight scan lines), and the final <b>Mode</b> <b>line</b> ends at scan line 2 showing scan lines 0 to 2 (three scan lines or VSCROL + 1). The total scan lines displayed in the scrolling region is then 6 + 8 + 3 = 17 scan lines.|$|R

In such production environment, mixed-model assembly lines are designed to support the production of a large scale of finished products obtained by the combination of alternative variants of components that ensure a specific functionality on the finished product. The availability of the required variant at each stage of the assembly process is critical for the production processes that operate in a just in time (JIT) environment as it’s the case for some first tier suppliers in the automotive industry. To ensure the availability of the required parts at each stage of the assembly process, several <b>line</b> feeding <b>modes</b> can be used. Their relative performance depends on several factors like the components’ diversity and physical features to name a few. The impact of these parameters on the performance of the <b>line</b> feeding <b>modes</b> is not well known and this issue remains weakly represented in the literature. Using an empirical approach, this study aims to analyse the performance of three <b>line</b> feeding <b>modes</b> (<b>line</b> stocking, kitting and sequencing) according to a set of key parameters.
