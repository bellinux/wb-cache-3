Our main result is a sufficient condition for the equivalence between left invertibility and left D-invertibility in MISO system. In unidimensional systems the equivalence is valid except at most a finite (and computable) number of cases.

Quantizers considered in this paper take finitely many values and have an adjustable “zoom” parameter. Building on an approach applied previously to systems with no disturbances, we develop a control methodology that counteracts an unknown disturbance by switching repeatedly between “zooming out ” and “zooming in”. Two specific control strategies that yield ISS are presented. The first one is implemented in continuous time, while the second one incorporates time sampling. We discover that {{in the presence of}} disturbances, time-sampling implementation requires an additional modification which has not been considered in previous work. I...|$|R
40|$|Hadamard {{states are}} {{generally}} considered as the physical states for <b>linear</b> <b>quantized</b> fields on curved spacetimes, for several good reasons. Here, we provide a new {{motivation for the}} Hadamard condition: for "ultrastatic slab spacetimes" with compact Cauchy surface, we show that the Wick squares of all time derivatives of the quantized Klein-Gordon field have finite fluctuations only if the Wick-ordering is defined {{with respect to a}} Hadamard state. This provides a converse to an important result of Brunetti and Fredenhagen. The recently proposed "S-J (Sorkin-Johnston) states" are shown, generically, to give infinite fluctuations for the Wick square of the time derivative of the field, further limiting their utility as reasonable states. Motivated by the S-J construction, we also study the general question of extending states that are pure (or given by density matrices relative to a pure state) on a double-cone region of Minkowski space. We prove a result for general quantum field theories showing that such states cannot be extended to any larger double-cone without encountering singular behaviour at the spacelike boundary of the inner region. In the context of the Klein-Gordon field this shows that even if an S-J state is Hadamard within the double cone, this must fail at the boundary.

Quantized outputs are generated {{according to a}} given partition of the state-space, while inputs are sequences on a finite alphabet. Left invertibility, i. e. injectivity of I/O map, is reduced to left D-invertibility, under suitable conditions. While left invertibility takes into account membership in sets of a given partition, left D-invertibility considers only distances, and {{is very easy to}} detect. Considering the system $x^+=ax+u$, our main result states that left invertibility and left D-invertibility are equivalent, for all but a (computable) set of $a$'s, discrete except for the possible presence of two accumulation point. In other words, from a practical point of view left invertibility and left D [...] invertibility are equivalent except for a finite number of cases. The proof of this equivalence involves some number theoretic techniques that have revealed a mathematical problem important in itself.

40|$|The roundoff {{errors in}} {{computer}} simulations of continuous dynamical systems, caused by finiteness of machine arithmetic, {{can lead to}} qualitative discrepancies between phase portraits of the resulting spatially discretized systems and the original systems. These effects can be modelled on a multidimensional integer lattice by using a dynamical system obtained by composing the transition operator of the original system with a quantizer. Such models manifest pseudorandomness which can be studied using a rigorous probability theoretic approach. To this end, the lattice Z^n is endowed with a class of frequency measurable subsets and a spatial frequency functional as a finitely additive probability measure on them. Using a multivariate version of Weyl's equidistribution criterion, we introduce an algebra of frequency measurable quasiperiodic subsets of the lattice. This approach is applied to <b>quantized</b> <b>linear</b> systems with the transition operator R ∘ L, where L is a nonsingular matrix of the original linear system in R^n, and the map R commutes with the additive group of translations of the lattice. For almost every L, the events associated with the deviation of trajectories of the quantized and original systems are frequency measurable quasiperiodic subsets of the lattice whose frequencies involve geometric probabilities on finite-dimensional tori. Using the skew products of measure preserving toral automorphisms, we prove mutual independence and uniform distribution of the quantization errors and investigate statistical properties of invertibility loss for the <b>quantized</b> <b>linear</b> system, extending V. V. Voevodin's results. When L is similar to an orthogonal matrix, we establish a functional central limit theorem for the deviations of trajectories of the quantized and original systems.
