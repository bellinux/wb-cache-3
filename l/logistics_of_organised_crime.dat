40|$|This study {{addresses}} transnational <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> and illicit {{financial flows}} in Nigeria, West Africa and the Global North (i. e. Europe). Based on extensive documentary analysis and expert interviews conducted in the four countries (i. e. Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal and the Gambia). It reveals the contemporary changes <b>of</b> <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> in a global context. Having outlined the dynamics <b>of</b> global transnational <b>organised</b> <b>crime,</b> the study examines three specific <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> groups in Nigeria. These are; human trafficking; drug trafficking and advance fee fraud (AFF) cybercrime related. Having considered the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> and its contemporary problems in Nigeria, the study turns to {{an evaluation of the}} regime against money laundering from a global perspective. It assesses some relevant global initiatives and instruments which combat the proceeds <b>of</b> <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> in West Africa and Nigeria. The study introduces the conceptual frameworks using the rational choice theory to ‘frame’ <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> offenders from Nigeria and the author uses Value, Accessability and Transaction (VAT) Model to explain the routine activities of the rational criminal actors from Nigeria before considering the anti-money laundering framework (i. e. the Financial Action Task Force 40 Recommendations) as the instruments to decrease the risk <b>of</b> <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> financial transactions within the global jurisdictions. The exploration of cybernetics in this study offers a scientific model called AntiMoney Laundering Transaction Validation Model with aim of providing a solution which strengthens the effectiveness of the anti-money laundering (AML, hereinafter) regimes in Nigeria, developing economies and globally. Finally, the thesis concludes that those international initiatives, recommendations and the instruments of soft-laws from developed countries to combat the {{illicit financial flows}} <b>of</b> <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> in developing economies cannot be effective without providing solutions to the impediments affecting the curbing of illicit financial flows from <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> in developing countries, such as Nigeria...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{generate}} a best estimate for the economic, financial and social costs <b>of</b> <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> in and against the EU and to inform an evidence-based understanding of the associated issues.

The study underlines that measuring the costs <b>of</b> <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> is still at an early stage of development {{and that there is a}} clear need for more cross-border data matching and investigation in order to improve the quality of the evidence basis for European law enforcement agencies and their effectiveness in fighting <b>organised</b> <b>crime...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{economic}} analysis <b>of</b> <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> {{suggests that some}} economic activities are particularly vulnerable to penetration by criminal organisations. This paper provides {{an analysis of the}} structure of the Sicilian economy and shows that, when compared with other Italian regions, it is characterised by a disproportionate presence of such activities. In particular, the economy of Sicily appears characterised by: (i) a large dimension of traditional sectors, such as the Construction sector, which also has a strong territorial specificity; (ii) a large presence of small firms; (iii) a low level of technology; (iii) a large public sector. The joint presence of these features creates fertile soil for the typical activities <b>of</b> <b>organised</b> <b>crime,</b> such as extortion and cartel enforcement. Hence, we propose an alternative explanation of the persistence <b>of</b> <b>organised</b> <b>crime</b> with respect to explanations based on cultural and social factors...|$|R
