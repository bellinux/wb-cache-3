25|$|Arsenal's {{second game}} in the Emirates Cup was against Ligue 1 runners up Monaco. Wenger fielded a 4–3–3 formation, which saw the {{introduction}} of first team names Wojciech Szczęsny, Laurent Koscielny, Jack Wilshere, Santi Cazorla and Olivier Giroud into the side. Summer signings Sánchez and Chambers started the match, which also served as the debut for £12million signing Mathieu Debuchy. Arsenal had needed only a draw to claim the Emirates Cup and entered the game <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> draw. However, Monaco were gifted the only goal of the match in the 37th minute when Radamel Falcao was given {{the freedom of the}} Arsenal penalty area to head home João Moutinho’s free-kick, awarded for Wilshere's clumsy lunge on Nabil Dirar, a challenge that booked the English midfielder. Having won 5–1 against Benfica 24 hours earlier, Arsenal struggled against the French side and created {{little in the way of}} clear-cut chances. Sánchez played on both flanks and then through the middle in the second period before being withdrawn in the 74th minute. Following the introduction of Chuba Akpom into the side, Arsenal showed direct running and looked for an equaliser. Akpom, who replaced Sánchez, was brought down by Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subašić as Akpom burst into the box, only for referee Martin Atkinson to award a free-kick rather than a penalty— despite replays showing the foul was clearly inside the area. The game finished 1–0 to Monaco, and with Valencia winning 3–1 against Benfica earlier that day, the Spanish side won the trophy.|$|E
25|$|After {{unexpectedly}} {{spending the}} night in the bush, the men from B Company scheduled to go on leave returned to Nui Dat the following morning. At 07:05 the depleted company—reduced to a single platoon and Company Headquarters—continued the search east as far as the edge of the rubber plantation, while A Company searched down the Suoi Da Bang towards them. A number of weapon pits were subsequently located, as were the firing positions of the mortars and RCLs, while discarded clothing and bloodstains found nearby confirmed the accuracy of the Australian artillery. At Nui Dat D Company, 6 RAR prepared for its patrol, test firing weapons and packing equipment. Despite the earlier bombardment only the standard ammunition load would be taken. Lightly armed, they carried just 60 rounds for their L1A1 and M16 rifles, and 200 rounds for each M60 machine-gun. Smith was briefed by Wickens who highlighted the likely presence of a Viet Cong force equipped with mortars, assessing it would be incapable of mounting an ambush due to the effect of the counter-battery fire. While the size of the force was unknown it was unlikely to be small and the possibility {{it was part of a}} larger force preparing to move against Nui Dat could not be discounted. The Viet Cong were believed able to attack a company-sized force and to launch mortar attacks similar to that the previous morning. Smith then discussed the patrol with Townsend. If B Company had located the withdrawal route used by the mortar crews, he was to follow it with the aim of interdiction; otherwise he was to continue the search until it was located. Assuming D445 Battalion to be the only unit in the area from the information available, Smith believed they were <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> unit's heavy weapons platoon of approximately 30 to 40 men. He briefed his platoon commanders accordingly, although he also felt the Viet Cong would have long since left the area. Meanwhile, 5 RAR (minus one company) returned to Nui Dat.|$|E

500|$|Pullin died in 1934 while {{travelling}} to a Test {{match at}} Lord's Cricket Ground. He collapsed {{on a bus}} and was pronounced dead on his arrival at hospital. He had been suffering from heart trouble for some time, but wished to continue working and to die [...] "with his boots on". He was buried in Wakefield cemetery. Upon his death, senior figures from Yorkshire County Cricket Club paid tribute to his influence, and his dignity and zealousness were praised by the Leeds branch of the National Union of Journalists. Hutton, who had just broken into the Yorkshire team aged 18, wrote that he [...] "had just got {{into the habit of}} <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> kindly, alert, grey-bearded face of Mr Pullin's either among the players before the day's play or in a Press-tent". Cardus concluded his tribute to Pullin in the Manchester Guardian: [...] " [...] wrote simply, well, and with courtesy and knowledge. A good man and a good friend".|$|E
500|$|The casting {{directors}} for Obsessed were Ron Digman and Valorie Massalas. According to Packer, Elba and Larter {{were the}} favorite actors for their respective lead roles; {{he stated that}} [...] "they both brought {{the right amount of}} depth and sex appeal" [...] to the film. He emphasized the need for actors [...] "who were relatable and who can handle that type of human interplay {{that we have in the}} film." [...] Packer showed the film script to Beyoncé's talent agent, who suggested that Beyoncé play the role of Sharon. The producers [...] "immediately ... fell in love with that idea; once she suggested Beyoncé, nobody else could play the role." [...] Packer said that Beyoncé became interested in working on Obsessed because the film was not focused on the music industry, and that it was the first time she played a non-singer. Packer also reported that [...] "she was <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> challenge and welcomed this opportunity". Beyoncé stated that she found it challenging to concentrate purely on [...] "the emotion and the psychology of the relationship". Beyoncé had never taken part in a fight scene, but she was able to learn how to perform the scenes quickly because they were similar to dance choreography, with which she was familiar. Larter was inspired by Rita Hayworth, Barbara Stanwyck and Faye Dunaway, all of whom had previously portrayed femmes fatale. Obsessed was filmed over the summer of 2008, and the final fight scene between Sharon and Lisa was shot over one week.|$|E

2500|$|Hollywood, Florida Police Chief Chadwick Wagner said Ottis Toole {{had been}} the prime suspect all along, but went on to admit that {{although}} Toole's case was weak, {{he could have been}} charged during the original investigation. Wagner acknowledged that many mistakes were made by the department and apologized to the Walsh family. Public critics of the indictment [...] argue that lack of new (public) evidence, and the inability of the defendant to defend himself of the allegations, leaves no definitive claim to his guilt. To this Wagner has stated: [...] "If you're <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> magic wand, that one piece of evidence, it's not there." [...] However, by reexamining previously uncorrelated evidence, police and the Walsh family are satisfied with the new report and existing evidence that points only to Ottis Toole.|$|E
2500|$|Donohue chronicled {{his entire}} racing {{career in the}} book, The Unfair Advantage (co-written with noted {{motorsports}} and engineering journalist Paul Van Valkenburgh). The book documents his career from his first races to his final full season of racing the year before he was killed. This was not merely a celebrity autobiography, but a detailed, step-by-step record of the engineering approach he took to getting the absolutely highest performance from every car he drove, always <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> elusive [...] "unfair advantage". Donohue (along with Penske) were pioneers in many rights, some as notable {{as the use of}} a skidpad as a tool for developing and perfecting race car suspension designs and setups. The book told how Donohue learned to exploit the antilock braking system and the powerful turbocharged engine of several prototype Porsches, as well as how he learned from various mishaps, including a near-fatal crash. The book was published shortly before Donohue's death.|$|E

2500|$|Explaining {{the reasons}} for her character's {{personality}} change, Bissix said [...] "I think it’s {{just the fact that}} she’s lonely.

Now she’s using the men and treating them badly...she's never felt settled. Her mother died, her father was abusive and she doesn't even know him. She's never felt like she's fitted in.

2500|$|During an {{interview}} in 2007, after finishing with his rehabilitation, Morgan explained how the song had [...] "haunted" [...] him around and badly affected his reputation. He stated {{that it was not}} pleasant to hear a song describing him as a [...] "bad guy" [...] which [...] "millions of people have heard". He elaborated, [...] "I was bummed out. I was really upset that she would say and do those things. In any relationship, I don't think it's right to say and do those things when people break up, and she obviously felt the need {{to go out there and}} make me sound like a complete a--hole ... I just refuse to lower myself to that level. But it was a painful thing and it got me down." [...] At the time of the interview, Seether's album Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces was to be released soon and speculations started arising to whether it would contain an answer song to [...] "Call Me When You're Sober"; [...] "Breakdown" [...] was initially pinpointed as a possible answer. In response to that, Morgan elaborated that the particular song was not an [...] "angry backlash" [...] and it was [...] "more universal" [...] as he was trying to be [...] "more vague and respectful". Talking about Lee's song, he mentioned how [...] "there are always two sides to every story", yet, he opted not to tell his side as [...] "hat's what the bloodthirsty want, and I don't care what the bloodthirsty want" [...] emphasizing that he [...] "didn't feel the need to write back and be mean". He added that Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces did not contain other answer songs aimed at Lee either, as [...] "I know what the expectations are for this album and that people will be <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> Amy Lee reference, and I am trying desperately not to have any" [...] further noting how any possible references would be about another relationship he had recently terminated or inspired by other people in his life. Lee expressed [...] "no intention of hurting [...] " [...] during {{an interview}}, but noted that once the song came out without any metaphors, she wanted to keep it.|$|E
