He is partly of <b>Latvian</b> descent; his father Rolf {{was born in}} Liepāja, where he remains well-known, to a <b>Latvian</b> mother and a Baltic German father. Rolf briefly played professionally for Karlsruher SC, as did his son Axel, Oliver Kahn's older brother.|$|E
5|$|Before either Baltic legion could {{complete}} training, {{these developments}} were overtaken by heavy casualties {{suffered by the}} West European legions on the Eastern Front, and like the West European legions, {{it was decided to}} combine the Baltic legions into larger formations. This resulted in the Estnische SS-Freiwilligen Brigade, consisting of the Estonian Legion and elements of the 1st SS Infantry Brigade, and the Lettische SS-Freiwilligen Brigade, formed around the <b>Latvian</b> Legion and parts of the 2nd SS Infantry Brigade. The origins of many of the men of the two SS infantry brigades was Reich German or Volksdeutsche, so these two formations were never purely Baltic. Not long after the two new volunteer brigades had been formed and committed to battle, they were upgraded to divisional status, and a third Baltic division was authorised, using the manpower of the <b>Latvian</b> security battalions. To man and maintain these three new divisions, Himmler ordered the conscription of Estonian and <b>Latvian</b> men, and made all former Estonian Army officers and non-commissioned officers liable for service. By 1944, the Waffen-SS included the three divisions, namely; the 15th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st <b>Latvian),</b> the 19th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd <b>Latvian),</b> and the 20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian). The two <b>Latvian</b> divisions were later combined into the VI SS Army Corps (<b>Latvian),</b> and all three divisions fought the Soviet Red Army in defence of their homelands during 1944, and were encircled there or destroyed in subsequent fighting elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The Siege of Sidney Street of January 1911, {{also known}} as the Battle of Stepney, was a gunfight in the East End of London between a {{combined}} police and army force and two <b>Latvian</b> revolutionaries. The siege was the culmination of a series of events that began in December 1910, with an attempted jewellery robbery at Houndsditch in the City of London by a gang of <b>Latvian</b> immigrants which resulted in the murder of three policemen, the wounding of two others, and the death of George Gardstein, the leader of the <b>Latvian</b> gang.|$|E
25|$|Russians settled {{mostly in}} towns {{rather than in}} the country. They tended to choose larger cities such as Riga and Daugavpils. Russians {{differed}} from <b>Latvians</b> in their professional characteristics. Over one third of the Russian population were engaged in industry (one quarter of <b>Latvians),</b> 7% of Russians (22% of <b>Latvians)</b> were engaged in agriculture, 1% of Russians (2.5% of <b>Latvians)</b> in the sphere of culture and art.|$|R
50|$|In the 1930s and 1940s, {{thousands}} of <b>Latvians</b> have faced repressions by the Stalinist regime. About 70 thousands Russian <b>Latvians</b> were {{killed during the}} repressions.|$|R
5000|$|In some cities, e.g., Daugavpils and Rēzekne, ethnic <b>Latvians</b> {{constitute}} {{a minority of}} the total population. Despite the fact that the proportion of ethnic <b>Latvians</b> has been steadily increasing for more than a decade, ethnic <b>Latvians</b> also make up slightly less than a half {{of the population of the}} capital city of Latvia - Rīga.|$|R
5|$|In October 2010, {{the brigade}} {{served as the}} command and control element for Saber Strike 11, a {{cooperative}} training effort aimed at improving interoperability and preparing <b>Latvian,</b> Estonian, Lithuanian and U.S. troops for upcoming deployments {{in support of the}} International Security Assistance Forces in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Latvian</b> city of Mitau (Jelgava) fell to Polish-Lithuanian forces {{commanded}} by Aleksander Hilary Połubiński in January 1660 and the allies were preparing {{an invasion of}} Zeeland; the outlook was {{not good for the}} Swedes. Fortunately for them, the war would soon end.|$|E
5|$|The {{starting}} peloton included Evgeni Berzin, the 1994 winner. Berzin's team, , {{also brought}} <b>Latvian</b> Piotr Ugrumov, a two-time Grand Tour runner-up. The two riders {{had developed a}} mutual distaste for each other. El País writers Paolo Viberti and Carlos Arribas believed that Swiss rider Tony Rominger and <b>Latvian</b> Piotr Ugrumov were the favorites to win the race, while Adrian Huber of Avui named Rominger as the sole favorite. Author Bill McGann believed that Rominger and Berzin were in great form coming into the race. Rominger entered the event after having recently won the Tour de Romandie. Aside from Rominger and Berzin, El Punts Luis Simon named 1988 winner Andrew Hampsten, Russian Pavel Tonkov, and Claudio Chiappucci amongst several other riders that could challenge for the overall title.|$|E
50|$|Ethnic <b>Latvians</b> {{have been}} one of the world's slowest-growing ethnic groups for a century. The number of <b>Latvians</b> today is {{actually}} less than it was in the 1920s.|$|R
50|$|<b>Latvians,</b> {{like their}} Balts neighbors Lithuanians, also began playing {{basketball}} in 1920s. Though, {{they were much}} more advanced back then than their frequent rivals Lithuanians. On 13 December 1925 in Riga, Lithuanians played their first international game. <b>Latvians</b> easily swept them with result 41-20. Later on, <b>Latvians</b> were crushing the future three-times European champions Lithuanians as well (41-29 or even 123-10). In fact, Latvia {{had one of the}} world's strongest national basketball teams. The first <b>Latvians</b> teams consisted of students and pupils, who were trained by coaches of American YMCA (Young Men's Christian Association).|$|R
50|$|In {{the local}} {{elections}} of 2009, 79.7% of elected councillors indicated their ethnicity as ethnic <b>Latvians,</b> 65.5% were male. In the parliamentary elections of 2014, 81 of 100 elected MPs were males, 71 indicated their ethnicity as ethnic <b>Latvians.</b> For comparison, {{in the beginning}} of 2010 ethnic <b>Latvians</b> were 59.4% of the population (and 71.8% among citizens) and women — 53.9%.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} {{professional}} athletes are from Coral Springs: MLS soccer player Stephen Herdsman, <b>Latvian</b> Higher League soccer player Nate Weiss, NFL football players Dan Morgan, Todd Weiner, Darius Butler, Steve Hutchinson, Cody Brown and Sam Young, and Major League Baseball player Anthony Rizzo of the Chicago Cubs.|$|E
5|$|As of {{the census}} taken in April 2001, the ethnic makeup of Žirmūnai was 59.2% Lithuanian, 16.8% Russian (the third highest {{percentage}} among Vilnius' elderates, behind Naujoji Vilnia and Naujininkai), 14.4% Poles, 3.8% Belarusian, 1.7% Ukrainian, 0.8% Jewish, 0.2% Tatar, 0.1% <b>Latvian,</b> 0.1% Armenian, and 2.9% other or unspecified ethnicity.|$|E
5|$|Holst {{was born}} in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, the elder of the two {{children}} of Adolph von Holst, a professional musician, and his wife, Clara Cox, née Lediard. She was of mostly British descent, daughter of a respected Cirencester solicitor; the Holst {{side of the family}} was of mixed Swedish, <b>Latvian</b> and German ancestry, with at least one professional musician in each of the previous three generations.|$|E
50|$|Grey {{peas and}} ham are {{generally}} considered as staple foods of <b>Latvians.</b> Sorrel soup is also consumed by <b>Latvians.</b> Rupjmaize {{is a dark}} bread made from rye, considered the national staple.|$|R
50|$|Following Latvia's {{accession}} to the European Union and the 2008 economic crisis, {{as many as}} 200,000 <b>Latvians</b> left the country. As at 2016, about 100,000 <b>Latvians</b> permanently lived in the United Kingdom.|$|R
25|$|According to the 2017 census, ethnic <b>Latvians</b> make up 55.5% of the {{population}} of Liepāja (in comparison, the proportion of native <b>Latvians</b> nationwide is 62.1%). Ethnic Russians make up 30.3% of {{the population}}.|$|R
5|$|In February, at the 2014 Rotterdam Open, {{he eased}} past Gaël Monfils and Paul-Henri Mathieu in {{straight}} sets, but fell to <b>Latvian</b> Ernests Gulbis in the quarterfinals. In the 2014 Dubai Tennis Championships, he retired against Somdev Devvarman {{after losing the}} first set due to his wrist injury. The same injury led to his subsequent withdrawal from Masters 1000 series events in Indian Wells and Miami, meaning that del Potro dropped to world No. 8.|$|E
5|$|On February 15, 2008, McNamara {{signed a}} {{contract}} with <b>Latvian</b> basketball team BK Ventspils. After his brief stint in Latvia, McNamara returned to the U.S. after being {{invited to participate in the}} Utah Jazz's training camp on September 17, 2008, but McNamara was waived on October 27, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{with the}} {{implementation}} of the Dnestr space surveillance units, {{a modified version of the}} original Dnestr units, Dnestr-M radar, was being developed to act as an early warning radar to identify attacks by ballistic missiles. The first two were built at Murmansk in northern Russia (Olenegorsk – RO-1) and near Riga in the then <b>Latvian</b> SSR (Skrunda – RO-2). They constituted the beginning of the Soviet SPRN network, the equivalent of the NATO BMEWS.|$|E
50|$|<b>Latvians</b> in Russia {{are a small}} ethnic {{minority}} scattered across various regions of Russia. According to the 2010 census, 18,979 people in Russia identified themselves as ethnic <b>Latvians,</b> down from 28,520 in 2002.|$|R
50|$|<b>Latvians</b> {{have always}} been the largest ethnic group in Latvia during the past century, but {{minority}} peoples {{have always been}} numerous. Before WW II the proportion of non-Latvians was approximately 25%, the Russians being the largest minority (app. 10%), followed by Jews (approx. 5%), Germans and Poles (2-3%). After World War 2 only small numbers of Jews and Germans remained and following a massive immigration of Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians, <b>Latvians</b> almost became a minority. In 1989, the proportion of <b>Latvians</b> had decreased to only 52% (from 75.5% in 1935). Despite the decreasing number of <b>Latvians</b> due to low fertility rates, the proportion of <b>Latvians</b> has considerably increased {{during the past two decades}} and reached 62.1% in 2011 (slightly higher than the 62.0% in 1959). This is due to large scale emigration of Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians. The number of these peoples almost halved between 1989 and 2011.|$|R
25|$|Many <b>Latvians</b> fled in fishermen's {{boats and}} ships to Sweden and Germany, from where until 1951 they drifted to {{various parts of}} the Western world (mostly Australia and North America). Approximately 150,000 <b>Latvians</b> ended up in exile in the West.|$|R
5|$|The City of London police {{informed}} the Metropolitan force, as their protocol demanded, and both services issued revolvers to the detectives {{involved in the}} search. The subsequent investigation was challenging for the police because of the cultural differences between the British police and the largely foreign residents of the area covered by the search. The police {{did not have any}} Russian, <b>Latvian</b> or Yiddish speakers on the force.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Latvian</b> {{government}} took {{a number of}} steps {{in order to try}} to bring the situation under control, and in 2006 not only were the events planned by right wing organizations not approved, but the monument was fenced off, according to an announcement by Riga city council, for restoration. The monument was indeed restored in 2006, but this statement was later questioned, as politicians named various other reasons for the change of date, the enclosed area was much larger than needed for restoration, and the weather appeared inappropriate for restoration work. Therefore, the government was criticized by the <b>Latvian</b> press for being unable to ensure public safety and freedom of speech. The unapproved events took place despite the ban. On November 23, 2006, the law requiring the approval of the authorities for public gatherings was ruled unconstitutional. In the future years the government mobilized the police force to guard the neighborhood of the monument and the events were relatively peaceful.|$|E
5|$|The {{memorial}} {{was initially}} planned and construction started in 1986, but was delayed after Latvia declared independence in 1991. The construction was revived in 2000 by German War Graves Commission {{with the help}} of local <b>Latvian</b> organisations and several German cities. It was financed mostly by German government and organisations, Austrian State Fund, and involved city donations. It was designed by Sergey Rizh and opened on November 30, 2001.|$|E
50|$|The {{share of}} ethnic <b>Latvians</b> {{had fallen from}} 77% (1,467,035) in 1935 to 52% (1,387,757) in 1989. In 2011, there were even fewer <b>Latvians</b> than in 1989, though {{their share of the}} {{population}} was larger - 1,285,136 (62.1% of the population).|$|R
50|$|Few <b>Latvians</b> {{arrived in}} Australia before 1947.|$|R

5|$|The {{memorial}} {{was opened}} on November 30, 2001, 60 {{years after the}} start of the deportations. The event was opened by the former president of Latvia Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga who in her speech noted the importance of raising people's awareness about the events that took place there. The event was well attended, including former <b>Latvian</b> Prime Minister Andris Bērziņš, <b>Latvian</b> chief rabbi Natans Barkans, officials and ambassadors from various countries, former ghetto and concentration camp inmates, and relatives of the victims from Lithuania, Estonia, Germany, Israel, Austria, and Russia. Several research, education, and remembrance events were held after the opening ceremony. The opening and the following events received local and foreign media coverage. The opening ceremony ended with a Jewish prayer Kaddish by Riga Jewish community cantor Vlad Shulman.|$|E
5|$|Within a {{few weeks}} of the {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, Berger's teams had begun recruiting Baltic volunteers for SS police units, forming several security battalions of <b>Latvian</b> and Estonian volunteers. The Wehrmacht also recruited eight Estonian battalions. This split approach to recruiting in the Baltic region continued into 1942, with some units being decimated in front line fighting. In May of that year, Berger decided to exploit the nationalists within the Baltic states in order to gain access to recruits for the Waffen-SS. Himmler was lukewarm on his initial proposal, but as casualties started to mount in 1942, he changed his mind, and approved the formation of a Waffen-SS Estonian Legion. Despite initial misgivings, Berger also proposed the formation of a <b>Latvian</b> Legion, which was approved at the end of 1942.|$|E
5|$|During {{the opening}} stages of World War II, the Soviet Union laid the {{foundation}} for the Eastern Bloc by invading and then annexing several countries as Soviet Socialist Republics, by agreement with Nazi Germany in the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. These included eastern Poland (incorporated into two different SSRs), Latvia (which became the <b>Latvian</b> SSR), Estonia (which became the Estonian SSR), Lithuania (which became the Lithuanian SSR), part of eastern Finland (which became the Karelo-Finnish SSR) and eastern Romania (which became the Moldavian SSR).|$|E
50|$|At the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Daugaviņš {{appeared}} {{in four games}} for Latvia, earning no points as the <b>Latvians</b> finished 12th. He also participated at the 2010 IIHF World Championship held in Germany, scoring two goals and three points in six games for the 11th place-finishing <b>Latvians.</b>|$|R
50|$|Johann Steinhauer's {{entrepreneurial}} successes, {{his efforts}} {{to bring about the}} right of ownership and freedom of worship on behalf of the native <b>Latvians</b> and serfs had far reaching consequences. At the time of his birth native <b>Latvians</b> and serfs were a stagnant social caste with little opportunity for social movement, the ruling of Riga's Senate opened new opportunities for future generations of inhabitants of Riga. Partly because of his support of the Moravian Church, it eventually became an accepted and popular religious movement among <b>Latvians,</b> having at one point 50,000 converts in three years.|$|R
