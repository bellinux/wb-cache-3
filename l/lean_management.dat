25|$|Other thinkers soon {{offered more}} {{ideas on the}} roles that workers play in mature {{industrial}} systems. These included ideas on improvement of the individual worker with attention to the worker's needs, not just {{the needs of the}} whole. James Hartness published The Human Factor in Works Management in 1912, while Frank Gilbreth and Lillian Moller Gilbreth offered their own alternatives to Taylorism. The human relations school of management evolved in the 1930s to complement rather than replace scientific management, with Taylorism determining the organisation of the work process, and human relations helping to adapt the workers to the new procedures. Today's efficiency-seeking methods, such as lean manufacturing, include respect for workers and fulfillment of their needs as integral parts of the theory. (Workers slogging their way through workdays in the business world do encounter flawed implementations of these methods that make jobs unpleasant; but these implementations generally lack managerial competence in matching theory to execution.) Clearly a syncretism has occurred since Taylor's day, although its implementation has been uneven, as <b>lean</b> <b>management</b> in capable hands has produced good results for both managers and workers, but in incompetent hands has damaged enterprises.|$|E

This paper introduces <b>lean</b> project <b>management</b> to address this concern. <b>Lean</b> project <b>management</b> forms a complementary approach to current project management practice and has been constructed by drawing together two approaches: management of projects and <b>lean</b> production.

These {{organizations in}}cluding suppliers and solutions providers are duty bound to improve their functions through strategic initiatives. One such initiative is <b>Lean</b> Process <b>Management.</b> <b>Lean</b> Process <b>Management</b> has proven to aid organizations in developing manufacturing and administrative management solutions and make the organization a leaner {{at the same time}} a ‘fitter’ one, achieving World Class standards in terms of production, quality, marketing, etc, etc. The issue or problem is, although a number of authors, experts, researchers have discussed the <b>lean</b> process <b>management</b> as part organization centric issues, they failed to provide an effective <b>lean</b> process <b>management</b> system. Besides the need to formulate an effective lean process as suggested by some authors, another important reason suggested is the employee’s development aspect regarding how to unlock the infinite potential of their workforce. This employee’s development is basically the problem solving capabilities of the employees while implementing the Lean through clear cutting protocols or processes of <b>Lean</b> Process <b>Management.</b> The employees need to be developed and equipped to contribute optimally to the process. Because of this scenario, the main objective of this study is to develop an employees development system which the author has acronym or trademark it as People Development System (PDS) to enhance problem solving capability among its employees while implementing the <b>lean</b> process <b>management</b> there. Although, the PDS can be implemented throughout the organization, if it is implemented in a particular department in an organization, it will be feasible to study and analyze its effectiveness in-depth. So, this study documents and analyzes the implementation of Lean process in the Kitting Department of the aerospace company, ABC Company. Qualitative and quantitative measures were also used to document the case study. The outcome of the people development system needs to be measured to understand its value in developing the problem solving capabilities among the employees. Only with developed and equipped employees, the Kitting Department can reduce its wastages, optimize its performance and thereby play a crucial role in making ABC Company a world class organization. As pertinent results of the PDS implementation, in general Kitting Department successfully achieved to meet their Department Key Performance Indicator and particularly the employees’ are also improve by practicing good lean behaviors and skill and knowledge in using lean tools which lead to better leanness level by improving employees’ problem solving capabilities in eliminating waste. On the whole, the <b>lean</b> process <b>management</b> and the resultant PDS is having positive applications, and importantly could also have positive applications in the future as well. </p...|$|R

This thesis analyzes and discusses how to implement strategic <b>lean</b> innovation <b>management</b> (SLIM) {{to an organization}} {{from the perspective of}} cultural change, business strategies, and management tools and practices. Lean concepts focus on the reduction and identification of waste, variability, and cost while adding value to the customer. Literature has shown that applying <b>lean</b> enterprise <b>management</b> strategies to an organization may lead to reduced effectiveness of some innovation efforts, especially if “value” is not defined appropriately. The ability to be lean while remaining innovative is important for companies to stay competitive. Little is known about how <b>lean</b> enterprise <b>management</b> and innovation management can be effectively applied together to an organization. The combination and implementation of these management strategies to an organization were analyzed and proposed at three levels: cultural transformation, business strategies, and business tools and practices. At the cultural level, three critical phases were identified and analyzed to provide solutions and ideas in achieving SLIM. At the business strategy level, product platform and innovation pipeline were identified as two strategies to achieve SLIM. At the tools and practices level, the value stream mapping tool and new product design process were improved by tradeoff analysis and combining concepts and advantages from both <b>lean</b> and innovation <b>management</b> philosophies. The findings and proposed ideas provide a guidance for organizations to effectively utilize the core concepts and benefits found in <b>lean</b> and innovation <b>management...</b>|$|R

One of the key purposes of configuration management is to control changes made to the software product. Agile development methods are becoming increasingly popular and claim to embrace change. These methods put emphasis on responsiveness to change rather than controlling change. How can these contradicting methodologies co-exist in the one and same project? This paper investigates the integration of configuration management and agile methods by introducing the concept of <b>Lean</b> Configuration <b>Management,</b> and shows how this can support an increased return on investment of the software project.
