5|$|As a {{literary}} theorist, Chivers believed in divine inspiration. He encouraged {{the development of}} a distinctive American style of literature and especially promoted young writers.

Though he built up a mild reputation in his day, he was soon forgotten after his death.|$|E

The songwriters included the audio in tribute to the unselfish work of the Challenger crew with hope that they will never be forgotten.|$|E

He is a biochemist leading the research into a cure for the virus {{from the safety of}} a biologically secure research and development facility. As the research begins to require increasingly unethical practices, he lies and rationalises in the struggle to maintain the loyalty of his colleagues. Unbeknownst to the other workers (all of whom had <b>lost</b> <b>loved</b> ones in the pandemic), he had secreted his wife (portrayed by Alisa Arnah) and young son within the facility, violating protocol. His true motives are suspect, as he answers to someone called Mr. Landry, with whom he communicates over a satellite video link. Until his death he was using stolen anti-virus produced from Abby's blood for himself, keeping it from the others, who died when the virus got into the lab after Abby infected his wife. At {{the end of the second}} series, he is accidentally shot and killed by a sniper in Landry's employ.|$|E

25|$|In Ecuador the Day of the Dead is {{observed}} {{to some extent}} by all parts of society, though {{it is especially important}} to the indigenous Kichwa peoples, who make up an estimated quarter of the population. Indigena families gather together in the community cemetery with offerings of food for a day-long remembrance of their ancestors and <b>lost</b> <b>loved</b> ones. Ceremonial foods include colada morada, a spiced fruit porridge that derives its deep purple color from the Andean blackberry and purple maize. This is typically consumed with guagua de pan, a bread shaped like a swaddled infant, though variations include many pigs—the latter being traditional to the city of Loja. The bread, which is wheat flour-based today, but was made with masa in the pre-Columbian era, can be made savory with cheese inside or sweet with a filling of guava paste. These traditions have permeated mainstream society, as well, where food establishments add both colada morada and gaugua de pan to their menus for the season. Many non-indigenous Ecuadorians visit the graves of the deceased, cleaning and bringing flowers, or preparing the traditional foods, too.|$|E

40|$|I am a {{contemporary}} visual arts practitioner collecting letters of <b>lost</b> <b>love</b> memories and utilising emotional objects {{to create a}} series of artefacts that embody past relationships. These artefacts act as a shrine or reliquary symbolising {{the feelings of the}} <b>lost</b> <b>love.</b> Hosting ‘Lost Love Cafes’ and creating ‘Love Donation Boxes’ has allowed individuals to contribute their stories through written letter or oral interview. Investigating into three types of love, familial, platonic and romantic, in conjunction with loss has allowed stories of partners, friendships, parents and relatives to be submitted. Analysis of the letters is on going, focusing on key moments, objects and feelings that inform design experimentation. These will form the basis for 9 artefacts, 3 of each love type. Each artefact will differ dependant on type of connection and time or emotion invested within different relationships. The N-Exlace has been created as an experimental piece based around a personal <b>lost</b> <b>love.</b> Using diary entries, photographs and love letters allowed me to re-connect with the emotions of the relationship, working with key events, objects and literature allowed the analysis to direct the design of the neckpiece. Working in translucent silicone allows impressions of objects to be captured leaving a ghostly trace like old memories and natural leather ages becoming imprinted like our own skin. I would like to propose an interactive talk, with elements of an installation and <b>lost</b> <b>love</b> story collection workshop, discussing previous work and process as to how letters of <b>lost</b> <b>love</b> are used to create emotional artefact. Concluding with a <b>lost</b> <b>love</b> writing session posing a series of thought provoking questions to encourage thought on familial, friendship or romantic <b>lost</b> <b>love.</b> These can be submitted to the <b>Lost</b> <b>Love</b> project if desired...|$|R

[...] Fowler stated that Isaacs' performance [...] "delivers a graceful and subdued performance as a man who, on a daily basis, must taste both heaven and hell. A man full of guilt, but also gratitude."

[...] "Bye Bye" [...] begins with an understated chorus, then working into the first verse, in which Carey retells her childhood, and her relationship with her father years ago: [...] "As a child there were them times / I didn't get it, but you kept me alive / I didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes / And its more than saying 'I miss you' / But I'm glad we talked through / All them grown full things separation brings / You never let me know it, you never let it show". Then, the pre-chorus continues describing Carey's emotions in the present, [...] "And everyday life goes on / I wish I could talk to you for a while", and how the loss of her father still affects her day-to-day life.|$|E

500|$|... "Don't Wake Me Up" [...] is an EDM {{song that}} {{features}} heavy bass; it lasts for 3 minutes and 42 seconds. The instrumentation {{is provided by}} an acoustic guitar and synthesizers. Brown uses auto-tune on the hook and breakdown. [...] "Don't Wake Me Up" [...] is written in the key of B♭ major and is set in common time with a tempo of 128 beats per minute. Brown's vocal range spans from the note of G4 to the note of C6. The song contains lyrics about a <b>lost</b> <b>loved</b> one who exists only in a dream, as stated by Brittany R. Villalva of The Christian Post. [...] "Don't Wake Me Up" [...] begins with a spoken introduction by an unidentified woman saying, [...] "Dearly Beloved, if this love only exists in my dreams, don't wake me up". Robbie Daw of Idolator compared her voice to that of Rihanna. The song's chorus consists of the hook [...] "Don't wake me up". Lewis Corner of Digital Spy wrote that the chorus [...] "flourishes into a pulse-racing mix of thundering beats and squiggly electronic swizzles". HitFix's Melinda Newman noted that the song [...] "resembles the sweet bounciness of 'Forever'".|$|E
500|$|At 11:35p.m., Obama {{appeared}} on major television networks:Good evening. Tonight, I can {{report to the}} American people {{and to the world}} that the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaeda, and a terrorist who was responsible for the murder of thousands of innocent men, women, and children... President Obama recalled the victims of the September 11 attacks. He praised the nearly ten-year-old war against al-Qaeda, which he said had disrupted terrorist plots, strengthened homeland defenses, removed the Taliban government, and captured or killed scores of al-Qaeda operatives. Obama said that when he took office he made finding bin Laden the top priority of the war. Bin Laden's death was the most significant blow to al-Qaeda so far but the war would continue. He reaffirmed that the U.S. was not at war against Islam and defended his decision to conduct an operation within Pakistan. He said Americans understood the cost of war but would not stand by while their security was threatened. [...] "To those families who have <b>lost</b> <b>loved</b> ones to al-Qaeda's terror," [...] he said, [...] "justice has been done." [...] This remark book-ended President Bush's statement to a joint session of Congress following the September 11 attacks that [...] "justice will be done." ...|$|E
500|$|Naruto {{has been}} {{described}} by several critics as a coming-of-age story. Psychologist Lawrence C. Rubin suggests that the storylines would appeal to readers of any age who have <b>lost</b> <b>loved</b> ones, or are having difficulty finding friends, or who are in other situations shown in the series. [...] In Yukari Fujimoto's view, as the characters mature, they show respect to the adults who have raised and taught them, making it a conservative storyline in comparison to other manga of the same time period such as One Piece and Air Gear. [...] Rik Spanjers sees the difference between Sasuke (a loner) and Naruto (an optimist) as tragic, arguing that the contrast between the two protagonists' approach to the world is fundamental to the plot: [...] "Naruto’s strength grows as he gains more loved ones to protect, while Sasuke remains alone and is increasingly absorbed by his quest for revenge". [...] Omote Tomoyuki points out that there are many comic moments in the story despite the difficulties Naruto finds himself in, but the comic elements diminish dramatically over time as Naruto grows into a teenager, particularly once Part II begins. [...] Shōnen Jump began to carry comedies such as Gintama and Reborn! from 2003 onwards, and in Tomoyuki's view {{this is part of the}} reason for the change in emphasis: Naruto [...] "was not supposed to provide laughter anymore".|$|E

Steve Morse of The Boston Globe called the song [...] "powerful" [...] {{and described the}} backing vocals as tender and choirlike. Don McLeese of the Chicago Sun-Times {{described it as a}} [...] "hymn to human rights". Adrian Thrills of NME called it [...] "a simple, plaintive lament of stunning beauty and sadness". Nicholas Jennings of Maclean's felt that it was The Joshua Trees [...] "most topical song". Music journalist Andrew Mueller felt the track was a [...] "wilfully downbeat finale". In Rolling Stone, Steve Pond said [...] "'Mothers of the Disappeared' is built around desolate images of loss, but the setting is soothing and restorative—music of great sadness but also of unutterable compassion, acceptance and calm." [...] Lennox Samuels of The Dallas Morning News stated that there was [...] "an ineffable sadness in Bono's vocals and images where 'Night hangs like a prisoner / Stretched over black and blue'", calling it [...] "a moving tribute" [...] to people around the world who had <b>lost</b> <b>loved</b> ones to warfare and conflict. He added [...] "hat's remarkable about the song is that despite the intrinsic pain, it remains eerily cleansing. Even in the midst of decay and excess and horror, Bono can find hope and absolution." [...] In 2006 Bono described it as [...] "a beautiful end to the album", saying, [...] "That song means as much to me as any of the songs on that album, it's right up there for me," [...] and noting that it is a song [...] "I'm very proud of to this day." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Bye Bye" [...] {{served as}} the album's thirteenth track, and also {{composed}} by Carey and Stargate. An [...] "inspirational power ballad", it is influenced by R and pop music genres. The song is built on an understated and simple piano-driven melody, that is decorated with a soft bass-line. Lyrically, the song was described by critics as a [...] "larger than life anthem", and an [...] "inspirational lighter-in-the-air ballad", and finds Carey remembering both her father, {{as well as any}} <b>lost</b> <b>loved</b> ones. While the verses are dedicated to him, the chorus was written in a third-person point of view, for her fans: [...] "This is for my peoples who just lost somebody / Your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady / Put your hand way up high / We will never say bye / Mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins / This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers / Lift your hands to the sky / Because we won't ever say bye bye". While listing several forms of loss, Carey encourages to never let go, and always live with their memory, and put their hands up if they ever lost someone, 'cause we won't ever say bye bye'. Serving as the album's closing number, [...] "I Wish You Well" [...] was compared to the closing number on Mimi, [...] "Fly Like a Bird". Similarly, [...] "I Wish You Well" [...] incorporates gospel influence into its melody of [...] "rousing piano waltz", that [...] "extends forgiveness to those who have wronged her in the past and is pretty much interchangeable with its predecessors." [...] Extensively making use of the whistle register, she references Mottola in another light than [...] "Side Effects": [...] "'I Wish You Well's' message to Mottola is similarly striking. Accompanied by a piano and some multi-tracked backing vocals, Carey sings: [...] "Still bruised, still walk on eggshells / Same frightened child, hide to protect myself / But you can't manipulate me like before." [...] She then prescribes Bible study and says, [...] "I wish you well." ...|$|E
