50|$|IQ {{imbalance}} is a performance-limiting {{issue in}} the design of direct conversion receivers, also known as zero intermediate frequency (IF) or homodyne receivers. Such a design translates the received radio frequency (RF, or passband) signal directly from the carrier frequency (fc) to baseband using only one mixing stage. The traditional heterodyne receiver structure needs an intermediate-frequency (IF) stage between the RF and baseband signals. The direct conversion receiver structure does not have an IF stage, and does not need an image rejection filter. Due to the lower component count, it is easier to integrate. However, a direct-conversion RF front-end suffers from two major drawbacks: one is IQ imbalance and the other is DC offset. When designing a homodyne receiver, control of IQ imbalance is necessary to <b>limit</b> <b>signal</b> demodulation error.|$|E

It {{is based on}} a previous off-line alkaline hydrolysis of the NMCs, for the production of methylamine (MA), and its subsequent derivatisation with o-phthalaldehyde (OPA). After that, the obtained derivative is involved in the peroxyoxalate chemiluminescent (PO-CL) reaction using imidazole as a catalyst being the CL emission proportional to the total NMC content. The chemiluminescent reaction is carried out in a flow injection analysis (FIA) manifold, employing sodium dodecyl sulphate micellar medium as carrier, which avoids the rapid degradation of POs in water solution.

40|$|The two {{dominant}} {{methods of}} reducing SRAM power {{have been to}} reduce operating range and to <b>limit</b> <b>signal</b> swings on the highcapacitance bit and I/O lines [1]. As a consequence, decode and write now consume a significant fraction of SRAM power. Dual-Vt CMOS circuit techniques implement reduced-swing decode and write [1]. Swings on high-capacitance predecode lines, bitlines and write bus, are limited to half Vdd. The half-Vdd supply is generated internally with high efficiency by chargerecycling between positive and negative half-swing signals. SRAM architecture and decoder organization are shown in Figure 1. The main limitation resulting from reducing signal swings is reduction in gate overdrive at the receiving transistor leading to delay penalty. This design overcomes this using positive and negative half-swing signals on high-capacitance predecode lines so active decode circuits see a full gate-overdrive...|$|E

Predation risk has been proposed to be one factor that could constrain the elaboration of visually conspicuous signals and ensure honesty, but little {{evidence exists}} because of limitations of earlier used methods. We investigated {{using a combination of}} field observations and experimental work if a conspicuous sexual signal of the threespine stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus, the red nuptial coloration of the male, increases predation risk. We compared the proportion of colorful males in the gut of a predator in the wild, the perch Perca fluviatilis, to that in the population, and found proportionally more red-colored stickleback in the gut. This indicates that the predator selectively preys on colorful males under natural conditions. To differentiate between the effects of color and behavior on susceptibility to predation, we experimentally investigated the attack behavior of the predator towards breeding stickleback males differing in coloration. We found the predator to preferentially attack more colorful males, independent of their behavior. These results indicate that predation risk is a cost of the sexual signal that could limit expression and influence the honesty of the signal as an indicator of mate qualit...|$|E
40|$|First {{systematic}} spin probe ESR {{study of}} water freezing {{has been conducted}} using TEMPOL and TEMPO as the probes. The spin probe signature of the water freezing has been {{described in terms of}} the collapse of narrow triplet spectrum into a single broad line. This spin probe signature of freezing has been observed at an anomalously low temperature when a milimoler solution of TEMPOL is slowly cooled from room temperature. A systematic observation has revealed a spin probe concentration dependence of these freezing and respective melting points. These results can be explained in terms of localization of spin probe and liquid water, most probably in the interstices of ice grains, in an ice matrix. The lowering of spin probe freezing point, along with the secondary evidences, like spin probe concentration dependence of peak-to-peak width in frozen <b>limit</b> <b>signal,</b> indicates a possible size dependence of these localizations/entrapments with spin probe concentration. A weak concentration dependence of spin probe assisted freezing and melting points, which has been observed for TEMPO in comparison to TEMPOL, indicates different natures of interactions with water of these two probes. This view is also supported by the relaxation behavior of the two probes. Comment: 20 pages, 8 figures, 22 reference...|$|E

This probe was specific for T. vaginalis DNA. It recognized strains from two regions in Italy (Sardinia, Piemonte) and from Mozambique (Africa).

40|$|Abstract: Wide {{range of}} {{applications}} such as disaster management, military and security have fueled the interest in sensor networks {{during the past few}} years. Sensors are typically capable of wireless communication and are significantly constrained in the amount of available resources such as energy, storage and computation. Such constraints make the design and operation of sensor networks considerably different from contemporary wireless networks, and necessitate the development of resource conscious protocols and management techniques. In this paper we present an energy efficient, scalable and collision free MAC layer protocol for sensor networks. The approach promotes time-based arbitration of medium access to <b>limit</b> <b>signal</b> interference among the transmission of sensors. Transmission and reception time slots are prescheduled to allow sensors to turn their radio circuitry off when not engaged. In addition, energy consumption due to active to sleep mode transitions is minimized through the assignment of contiguous transmission/reception slots to each sensor. Scalability of the approach is supported through grouping of sensors into clusters. We describe an optimization algorithm for energy conscious scheduling of time slots that prevents intra-cluster collisions and eliminates packet drop due to buffer size limitations. In addition, we also propose an arbitration scheme that prevents collisions among the transmission of sensors in different clusters. The impact of our approach on the network performance is qualified through simulation...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThe shallow-water environment poses many obstacles to submerged and surface operations. Not least {{of them are}} the obstacles posed to acoustic detection of quiet contacts. The presence of Internal Solitary Waves (ISWs) within this environmet induce acoustic variability and phase fluctuations, which <b>limit</b> <b>signal</b> processing capability and further complicate operations in this environment. However, {{a better understanding of}} how ISWs affect sound propagation may lead us to take advantage of some of the effects of the ISWs, such as how ISWs focus acoustic energy into certain modes allowing detection of quiet sources above background noise. An understanding of the phase fluctuation may also lead to better processing algorithms. While multiple numerical simulations have been conducted, which allow for the effects of ISWs to be intuited from them, an analytical model that can predict the effects on acoustic propagation by the physical parameters of the ISWs had not been produced until Professor John A. Colosi of the Naval Postgraduate School developed a single scattering analytical model of those effects. In this thesis, the Colosi Single Scattering model will be compared to an accepted 3 -D PE model in order to further validate the model. In the comparison, numerous simulations from both models have been used to determine how closely the Single Scattering model can predict the vertical mode coupling effects of ISWs.

40|$|Context. One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} of modern cosmology is {{to understand the nature}} of the mysterious dark energy which causes the cosmic acceleration. The Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect is sensitive to dark energy and if detected in a universe where modified gravity and curvature are excluded, presents an independent signature of dark energy. The ISW effect occurs on large scales, where cosmic variance is high and where there are large amounts of missing data in the CMB and large scale structure maps due to Galactic confusion. Moreover, existing methods in the literature often make strong assumptions about the statistics of the underlying fields or estimators. Together these effects can severely <b>limit</b> <b>signal</b> extraction. Aims. We want to define an optimal statistical method for detecting the ISW effect, which can handle large areas of missing data and minimise the number of underlying assumptions made about the data and estimators. Methods. We first review current detections (and non-detections) of the ISW effect, comparing statistical subtleties between existing methods, and identifying several limitations. We propose a novel method to detect and measure the ISW signal. This method assumes only that the primordial CMB field is Gaussian. It is based on a sparse inpainting method to reconstruct missing data and uses a bootstrap technique to avoid assumptions about the statistics of the estimator. It is a complete method, which uses three complementary statistical methods...|$|E
40|$|Many animals use {{signals to}} {{communicate}} their social status to conspecifics, {{and the social}} control hypothesis suggests that social interactions maintain the evolutionary stability of status signals: low-quality individuals signal at a low level to prevent high-quality individuals from “punishing” them. I examined whether the numbers of decorations at bowers are socially controlled in the great bowerbird (Ptilonorhynchus nuchalis). In two populations, I supplemented males with decorations {{to determine whether they}} (a) rejected supplemental decorations and (b) experienced increased bower destruction from rivals. In contrast to the social control hypothesis, males in both populations accepted most supplemental decorations. Though the mean destruction rate did not increase during supplementation in either population, one of the study populations (Townsville) exhibited a negative correlation between the numbers of decorations naturally displayed at bowers and the change in destruction rate during the experiment. Townsville males that naturally had few decorations at their bowers also had more decorations stolen by other males during supplementation than males that naturally had many decorations. These results suggest that the numbers of decorations at bowers are an honest signal of the male's ability to defend his display site from rivals in at least one population of the great bowerbird (Townsville), but they do not support the social control hypothesis because males at both sites failed to <b>limit</b> <b>signal</b> expression.

In {{order to maintain the}} equilibrium without dissociation of bilirubin from the albumin/bilirubin complex as in real clinical conditions, the coupling of CE with frontal analysis (FA) was investigated. A very large sample plug was introduced hydrodynamically into the capillary (36 cm length, 50 μm inner diameter) at 15 psi·s to develop the frontal conditions during CE separation. The working conditions for CE/FA separation of bilirubin and albumin were optimized as follows: + 20 kV; running buffer, 10 mmol/L phosphate and 1 mmol/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), pH 7. 4. The working range for bilirubin was found to vary from 5 to 206 μmol/L; precision with relative standard deviation (RSD) < 2. 0 % for n = 3 and detection <b>limit</b> (<b>signal</b> to noise, S/N = 2) was 2 μmol/L. The residual binding capacity of a simulated cord blood serum for bilirubin was 26 mg/ 100 mL at pH 7. 4. Bilirubin was shown to be displaced from albumin when aspirin was added. The free bilirubin concentration was found to increase to clinical significant concentrations from 11. 9 to 21. 1 % when increasing aspirin was added in the range of 5 - 50 mg/ 100 mL, respectively.
