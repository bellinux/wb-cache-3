She had {{a beam of}} 19.8m (65ft) and a draft of 7.5m (24ft 6in). The ship displaced 8,364metric tons (8,232long tons). Habsburg had a crew of 638 officers and enlisted men.|$|E
5|$|The König-class {{ships were}} 174.7m <b>long</b> <b>at</b> the waterline, and 175.4m long overall. With {{a beam of}} 29.5m, a forward draft of 9.19m and a rear draft of 9.0m, the Königs were {{designed}} to displace 25,796metric tons normally, but at full combat load, they displaced 28,600tons. The hulls were constructed with transverse and longitudinal steel frames, over which the outer hull plates were riveted. The ships' hulls each contained 18 watertight compartments, each equipped with a double bottom that ran for 88% {{of the length of}} the hull.|$|E
5|$|The {{first four}} M-class shipsM, N, O, and Pwere 178 meters <b>long</b> <b>at</b> the waterline, and 183 meters long overall. They had {{a beam of}} 17 meters and a draft of 5.42 meters standard, 7.25 meters forward, and 6.03 meters aft. The ships had a {{designed}} displacement of 8,500metric tons, but displaced 7,800tons at standard load and 10,400tons fully laden. The ships had a crew of 28 officers and 892 men. They were designed to carry one picket boat, a barge, a launch, and two cutters.|$|E

5|$|The {{last two}} shipsQ and Rwere {{enlarged}} versions: 188 meters <b>long</b> <b>at</b> the waterline and 196 m overall. Their beams were 1 meter wider, at 18 meters. The ships' draft was lower at 5.4 meters. The ships {{were designed to}} displace 9,300 tons, and displaced 8,568 tons standard. All six ships were to have steel-made, and up to 85% welded construction. The design called for fifteen watertight compartments and a double bottom for 78% {{of the length of}} the hull.|$|E
5|$|At Aliso Beach, {{the mouth}} of Aliso Creek, lies a {{freshwater}} pond that changes frequently in elevation and extent. Tidal activity at the creek's mouth results in sediment building gradually up into a sandbar, impounding it in a small lake about 0.2 miles (0.3km) <b>long</b> <b>at</b> its fullest extent. Afterwards, the water level rises upstream of the sandbar until one of two factors causes it to breach: either waves at high tide wash away {{the top of the}} sandbar, or the lagoon rises enough to overtop the sandbar by itself. Once the water level rises above the sandbar, rapid erosion quickly cuts through the sand and drains the approximately 3–5-foot (0.9–1.5 m)-deep lake in a matter of minutes. Peak flows through the sandbar can reach , even if the incoming flow of the creek is nowhere near that size. Because of the raised flow of the creek and the construction of a parking lot in the lagoon area since the 1960s, the lagoon has never been able to fill to its much larger, historic extent without breaching. Species such as the tidewater goby have suffered because of loss of their habitat this way.|$|E
5|$|M. alcathoe has the highest-frequency {{echolocation}} call of any European Myotis. In open terrain, {{the call}} has an average duration of 2.5ms, {{but it may}} be up to 4ms <b>long.</b> <b>At</b> the beginning, its frequency is around 120kHz, but it then falls fast, subsequently falls slightly slower, and at the end falls faster again. The call reaches its highest amplitude at around 53kHz. It terminates at around 43 to 46kHz; this characteristic is especially distinctive. In different experiments, the time between calls was found to be around 85 and 66ms, respectively. The high-pitched call may be an adaptation to the animal's occurrence in dense vegetation.|$|E

5|$|On July 22, 1916, Riley {{suffered}} a second stroke. He recovered enough {{during the day}} to speak and joke with his companions. He died before dawn the next morning, July 23. Riley's death shocked the nation and made front page headlines in major newspapers. President Woodrow Wilson wrote a brief note to Riley's family offering condolences {{on behalf of the}} entire nation. Indiana Governor Samuel M. Ralston offered to allow Riley to lie in state at the Indiana Statehouse—Abraham Lincoln being the only other person to have previously received such an honor. During the ten hours he lay in state on July 24, more than thirty-five thousand people filed past his bronze casket; the line was still miles <b>long</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of the day}} and thousands were turned away. The next day a private funeral ceremony was held and attended by many dignitaries. A large funeral procession then carried him to Crown Hill Cemetery where he was buried in a tomb at the top of the hill, the highest point in the city of Indianapolis.|$|E
5|$|On {{the bottom}} of the skull, the pterygoid is about twice as wide as it is <b>long.</b> <b>At</b> the front of the pterygoid is a small {{projection}} that extends backwards to form a ridge, on either side of which is a furrow-like depression (the choanal groove) containing the choanae. In Theriosuchus, unlike Knoetschkesuchus, the choanae are embedded in a wider bowl-like depression. Additionally, in both species, the bottom surface of the pterygoid is somewhat concave. Extending forward from either side of the pterygoid is the ectopterygoid; in both species, this bone is constricted near the middle to form an hourglass-like shape, but in K. langenbergensis it is also somewhat twisted to the side. The back of the bone is very concave in both species.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the biggest}} successes in film in the 1930s and the pride of MGM at the time, it was {{acclaimed}} as the greatest musical biography {{to be made in}} Hollywood and still remains a standard in musical film making. It won three Academy Awards, including Best Picture for producer Hunt Stromberg, Best Actress for Luise Rainer, and Best Dance Direction for Seymour Felix, and was nominated for four others. Although the film is still praised for its lavish production and as a symbol of glamor and excess during the Golden Age of Hollywood, today The Great Ziegfeld is generally seen less favorably and is considered by many critics to be excessively showy and <b>long</b> <b>at</b> just under three hours.|$|E

The ball was recovered by the Hokies at the Alabama 30-yard line, and Tech's offense started their drive inside Alabama territory.|$|E
5|$|Vocalisations are {{frequent}} as the juveniles disperse, {{and again as}} they congregate in the morning. Nearby adults, presumably the parents, also give signals warning of predators or alerting the youngsters {{to the presence of}} food. The range and quantity of vocalisations vary between species. Alligators are the noisiest, while some crocodile species are almost completely silent. Adult female New Guinea crocodiles and Siamese crocodiles roar when approached by another adult, while Nile crocodiles grunt or bellow in a similar situation. The American alligator is exceptionally noisy; it emits a series of about seven throaty bellows, each a couple of seconds <b>long,</b> <b>at</b> ten second intervals. It also makes various grunts and hisses. Males create vibrations in the water to send out infrasonic signals that serve to attract females and intimidate rivals. The enlarged boss of the male gharial may serve as a sound resonator.|$|E
5|$|An {{agreement}} was reached between Elizabeth's and Polish delegates in Sieradz on 26 February 1383. The queen dowager thereby proposed her youngest daughter Hedwig as Louis' successor in Poland, and absolved the Polish nobles from their 1382 oaths to Mary and Sigismund. She agreed to send Hedwig to be crowned in Kraków but requested that, in view of her age, she spend three more years in Buda following the ceremony. The Poles, entangled in a bloody civil war, initially conceded to the requirement, but soon found it unacceptable for their monarch to reside abroad for so <b>long.</b> <b>At</b> the second meeting in Sieradz, held on 28 March, they contemplated offering the crown to Hedwig's distant relative, Duke SiemowitIV of Masovia. They eventually opted against it, but at the third Sieradz meeting, on 16 June, Siemowit himself decided to lay claim to the crown. Elizabeth reacted by having an army of 12,000 men devastate Masovia in August, forcing him to drop his pretensions. Meanwhile, {{she realized that she}} could not expect the nobles to accept her request and instead resolved to delay Hedwig's departure. Despite continuous Polish demands to expedite her arrival, Hedwig did not move to Kraków until the end of August 1384. She was crowned on 16 October 1384. No regent was appointed, and the 10-year-old exercised her authority according to the advice of Kraków magnates. Elizabeth never saw her again.|$|E
