2500|$|Treatment of OIC is {{successional}} {{and dependent}} on severity. The first mode of treatment is non-pharmacological, and includes lifestyle modifications like increasing dietary fiber, fluid intake (around [...] per day), and physical activity. If non-pharmacological measures are ineffective, laxatives, including stool softeners (e.g., docusate), bulk-forming laxatives (e.g., fiber supplements), stimulant laxatives (e.g., bisacodyl, senna), and/or enemas, may be used. A common laxative regimen for OIC {{is the combination}} of docusate and bisacodyl. Osmotic laxatives, including lactulose, polyethylene glycol, and milk of magnesia (magnesium hydroxide), as well as mineral oil (a <b>lubricant</b> <b>laxative),</b> are also commonly used for OIC.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lubricant</b> <b>laxatives</b> are {{substances}} that coat the stool with slippery lipids and retard colonic absorption of water {{so that the}} stool slides through the colon more easily. <b>Lubricant</b> <b>laxatives</b> also increase the weight of stool and decrease intestinal transit time.|$|R
50|$|Laxatives vary as to {{how they}} work and the side effects they may have. Certain stimulant, <b>lubricant</b> and saline <b>laxatives</b> are used to {{evacuate}} the colon for rectal and bowel examinations, and may be supplemented by enemas under certain circumstances. Sufficiently high doses of laxatives may cause diarrhea.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to fluid support, impactions are often treated with intestinal <b>lubricants</b> and <b>laxatives</b> to help move the obstruction along. Mineral oil {{is the most}} commonly used lubricant for large colon impactions, and is administered via nasogastric tube, up to 4 liters once or twice daily. It helps coat the intestine, but is not very effective for severe impactions or sand colic since it may simply bypass the obstruction. Mineral oil has the added benefit of crudely measuring GI transit time, a process which normally takes around 18 hours, since it is obvious when it is passed. The detergent dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DDS) is also commonly given in oral fluids. It is more effective in softening an impaction than mineral oil, and helps stimulate intestinal motility, but can inhibit fluid absorption from the intestine and is potentially toxic so is only given in small amounts, two separate times 48 hours apart. Epsom salts are also useful for impactions, since they act both as an osmotic agent, to increase fluid in the GI tract, and as a laxative, but do run the risk of dehydration and diarrhea. Strong laxatives are not recommended for treating impactions.|$|R
