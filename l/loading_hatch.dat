Most bedars carried a platform over the sharp stern section called the [...] "dandan" [...] that carried a round cabin made of bamboo, rattan and tikal matting and served as living quarters for the crew and as shelter for the helmsmen. The bedars below 45 feet in length over deck carried a round cabin just aft of the main mast while the bigger ones had a flush deck with two <b>loading</b> <b>hatches.</b>|$|R
50|$|A pickle {{car was a}} {{specialized}} type of tank car designed to carry pickles. This car consisted of several wooden or metal vats (typically three or four) and was often roofed. Pickles which are preserved in salt brine were <b>loaded</b> through <b>hatches</b> in the roof.|$|R
50|$|Venting holes {{were opened}} {{on the side of}} the galleries. Mechanical iron hatches were installed, along with the {{electric}} railway into the upper tunnel. The train brought the ore to the <b>loading</b> <b>hatches</b> of the reservoirs, while in the lower tunnel the unloading hatches fed the ore to the conveyor belt leading to the ships. The belt was covered with a steel casing to prevent the wind blowing away zinc oxide powder. It was extensible, and retracted after a load was delivered to the ship's hold. The main conveyor belt featured an innovative movable alignment system, designed to reduce the risk of the belt escaping the driving wheels under the pressure of the falling ore. The main belt dumped the ore on the slightly lower extensible conveyor belt, which could be protruded for 15 m and channeled the ore powder into a vertical shaft going to the hold of a moored ship.|$|R
50|$|The company's last {{design was}} a {{freighter}} conversion the PT-6F. First flown in 1937, the original passenger cabin was modified as a cargo compartment with 156 ft³ (4.42m³) of stowage space. A freight door was fitted to the fuselage and a <b>loading</b> <b>hatch</b> fitted in the roof. It was {{powered by a}} Wright R-975E-1 radial engine. An airworthy PT-6F is currently (2008) in a private collection at Anoka County-Blaine Airport, near Minneapolis.|$|E

This monument is the only shore installation in the United States where the Royal Navy ensign is authorized to be permanently flown by the British Admiralty. It flies alongside the US flag to commemorate Anglo-American cooperation during World War II.|$|E
50|$|John Hamilton Gray was {{designed}} to be compatible with the A Dock at both Borden and Cape Tormentine which was in use by the original MV Abegweit (and whose design is traced to the SS Prince Edward Island). John Hamilton Gray loaded only from the stern on the lower rail/truck deck, however until a modification in the early 1980s (in advance of the arrival of the new MV Abegweit), the upper car deck was loaded from a side hatch at the stern. The modification in the early 1980s saw the side hatch sealed and a stern <b>loading</b> <b>hatch</b> added.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first four}} trials units of these eight-wheeled, large-volume [...] "GGhs Bromberg" [...] class goods vans {{were built in}} 1942. In 1944, several wagons of [...] "GGths Bromberg" [...] class followed. Their {{development}} was probably related to the transport of war materiel, {{because there was no}} actual requirement for this type of wagon and very few were built. They had a loading length of 16,620 mm, a payload of 51 tonnes, an unladen weight of 21.8 tonnes and a length over buffers of 18,000 mm. They were equipped with steam heating pipes and rated for a top speed of 120 km/h. They also had two 2,000-mm-wide sliding doors, three <b>loading</b> <b>hatches</b> and two ventilation hatches {{on each side of the}} van as well as Hildebrandt-Knorr brakes for goods trains (Hikg). Unlike the GGhs the GGths still had two end doors and was therefore also suitable for the transport of motor vehicles. With 75 units, it was the most built wagon of this class.|$|R

50|$|Both {{sides of}} the wagon had three <b>loading</b> or {{ventilation}} <b>hatches</b> and a sliding door measuring 2 metres x 2 metres. Its loading length was 10.72 metres, its width 2.74 metres and its loading height 2.845 metres to the highest point of the roof. The side walls were 2.12 metres high and the loading area was 29.4 m2. Its loading volume was 79.1 m3 including the roof space and 62.3 m3 to {{the height of the}} walls.|$|R
50|$|The U-534 had {{aboard a}} crew of 52 men; all escaped the sub, and 49 survived to be rescued. Five were trapped in the torpedo room {{as she began to}} sink, but they managed to escape through the torpedo <b>loading</b> <b>hatch</b> once the boat had settled on the sea bed. They planned their escape the way that they had been trained, exiting through the forward torpedo hatch once the U-534 had settled on the seabed and {{swimming}} to the surface from a depth of 67 m. One of them, 17-year-old radio operator, Josef Neudorfer, failed to exhale as he was surfacing and died from damage to his lungs. The other deaths were by exposure.|$|E
50|$|In {{the next}} several minutes, tragedy would claim all 51 crewmen except for one, Machon. He and a boatswain's mate decided to attempt to open the torpedo <b>loading</b> <b>hatch</b> rather than die from the gas. Because his crewmate had no snorkel, he let him go first and quickly followed. After exiting the boat, his crewmate got {{confused}} with the direction {{to the surface and}} swam horizontally, only to lose himself between the hull and the superstructure. Upon reaching the surface, Machon swam around for roughly 1.5 hours unsuccessfully looking for his partner until an inflated life-jacket was dropped to him from a circling airplane from the 99th bombing squadron. This was soon followed by a drop of a thermos outfitted with water, a signal pistol, paddles and about 200 ft of rope.|$|E
5000|$|In the mid-1970s, after {{analysis}} {{of the use of}} light AFVs during the Yom Kippur, Angolan and Vietnam wars, a modernization program was begun that resulted in the BMP-1P (Ob'yekt 765 Sp4). The main changes were the replacement of the largely ineffective 9M14M Malyutka ATGM with the more reliable, longer range and more powerful 9P135M or 9P135M-1 ATGM launcher. It was located on a special pintle mount on top of the turret roof, that could fire the SACLOS guided 9M113 and 9M113M Konkurs-M ATGMs, which increased armor penetration to 670 mm and had an extended range of 4000 m. The 9P135M-1 launcher was also capable of firing 9M111 and 9M111-2 Fagot ATGMs. The Malyutka <b>loading</b> <b>hatch</b> was usually welded shut and the mounting bracket was removed. The new missiles were somewhat difficult to use since the gunner had to stand in his open hatch, exposing himself to hostile fire. It is possible to detach the 9P135M(1) ATGM launcher from the turret and use it from the ground. The BMP-1P was equipped with neutron weapon protection covering and a new fire-extinguishing system for protection against napalm. Later BMP-1Ps were fitted with an array of six 902V [...] "Tucha" [...] 81 mm calibre smoke grenade launchers {{at the rear of the}} turret. Some were also equipped with the track-width KMT-10 mine plow. The BMP-1P replaced the BMP-1 in production in 1979 and many BMP-1s were upgraded to the new standard during the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|Stanley Potato House is a {{historic}} potato house located near Laurel, Sussex County, Delaware, United States. It {{one of the last}} surviving examples of its building type. It was built about 1920, and is a 1 1/2-story, gable fronted, balloon frame structure on a brick foundation. It measures 17 feet by 23 feet. It retains a number of important elements characteristic of potato house including: minimal fenestration, center aisle floor plan, double siding, and <b>hatched</b> <b>loading</b> doors.|$|R
2500|$|The {{design was}} a four-engine high-wing {{monoplane}} with tricycle undercarriage, originally designed for 14 (three abreast seating with six additional seats {{mounted on the}} side) and eventually converted to take 20 passengers. The side [...] "couch seats" [...] were also able to be folded away so that cargo could be carried internally in the cabin. Individual storage space was provided for each passenger seat on the fuselage side above the seat. In order to accommodate a larger cargo <b>load,</b> a cargo <b>hatch</b> was located near the pilot's compartment.|$|R
50|$|Some {{machines}} {{which actually}} load {{from the top}} are otherwise much more similar to front-loading horizontal-axis drum machines. They have a drum rotating around a horizontal axis, as a front-loader, {{but there is no}} front door; instead there is a liftable lid which provides access to the drum, which has a hatch which can be latched shut. Clothes are <b>loaded,</b> the <b>hatch</b> and lid are closed, and the machine operates and spins just like a front-loader. These machines are narrower but usually taller than front-loaders, usually have a lower capacity, and are intended for use where only a narrow space is available, as is sometimes the case in Europe. They have incidental advantages: they can be loaded without bending down; they do not require a perishable rubber bellows seal; and instead of the drum having a single bearing on one side, it has a pair of symmetrical bearings, one on each side, avoiding asymmetrical bearing loading and potentially increasing life.|$|R
5000|$|BMP-1P (Ob'yekt 765Sp4) - The {{first serious}} {{modernization}} of the BMP-1; {{it was developed}} {{in the middle of the}} 1970s after an analysis of BMP-1 combat use during the 1973 Yom Kippur War and during the Angolan Civil War three years later. Firepower was enhanced by adding the pintle-mounted 9P135M launcher with a semi-automatic control capable of firing SACLOS guided 9M113 [...] "Konkurs" [...] (AT-5 Spandrel) and 9M113M [...] "Konkurs-M" [...] (AT-5B Spandrel B) ATGMs which increased armor penetration and extended weapon range. Many BMP-1Ps were equipped with an improved pintle-mounted 9P135M-1 ATGM launcher, which was also capable of firing the 9M111 [...] "Fagot" [...] (AT-4 Spigot) or 9M111-2 [...] "Fagot" [...] (AT-4B Spigot B) ATGMs. The new ATGM launchers were somewhat difficult to operate since the gunner had to stand in the open hatch on top of the turret to use the weapons, exposing himself to hostile fire and in NBC conditions destroying whatever value the BMP-1P's NBC protection suite gave. The Malyutka <b>loading</b> <b>hatch</b> was usually welded shut and the mount was removed. A special NBC protection covering was placed on the inside and outside of the turret, the hull, the engine compartment upper access hatch, the commander's and driver's hatches as well as under the driver's station. A new fire-extinguisher system for protection against napalm was installed after an analysis of armored fighting vehicle (AFV) usage during the Vietnam War. There is an additional machine gun firing port on the left side of the hull and at the front of the turret. This increased the number of firing ports from seven to nine. For protection against air attacks, two 9M32M [...] "Strela-2M" [...] (SA-7b [...] "Grail" [...] Mod 1) or 9M313 Igla-1 (SA-16 Gimlet) missiles of corresponding performance were added instead of the previous 9M32 [...] "Strela-2", but sometimes they were replaced by an RPG-7 portable, shoulder-launched, anti-tank rocket propelled grenade launcher. The BMP-1P weighs 13.4 tonnes. It was built from 1979 to 1983. NATO gave it the designation BMP M1981 ...|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of iodine {{disinfection}} on the bacterial flora and hatching rate of grouper egg at two different stages of development were investigated. The eggs (at cleavage and eyed stages) were soaked for 10 min in sterile seawater (control) and at different free iodine concentrations- 2. 5, 5, 10, 15 and 20 ppm. Total bacterial and presumptive Vibrio count, {{as well as the}} hatching rate of the treated eggs were determined. Results showed that Vibrios are eliminated by iodine disinfection (2. 5 - 20 ppm) but not by rinsing with sterile seawater. The total bacterial <b>load</b> and <b>hatching</b> rate of eggs decreased as the iodine concentration increased. Iodine concentrations of 15 and 20 ppm were effective in significantly reducing the total bacterial load of grouper egg at both the cleavage and eyed stages. However, at these concentrations the hatching rates were also significantly lower. Results also showed that grouper, Epinephelus coioides, eggs tolerate stress better at the eyed stage than at the cleavage stage.

50|$|More {{recent work}} by Smith in 2007 {{confirmed}} prior forensic work by Faulkner in 1998 {{and determined that}} the MV Derbyshire was exposed to a hydrostatic pressure of a static head of water of about 20 m with a resultant static pressure of 201 kN/m2. This is in effect 20 metres of green water (possibly a super rogue wave) flowing over the vessel. The deck cargo hatches on the Derbyshire were determined {{to be the key}} point of failure when the rogue wave washed over the ship. The design of the hatches only allowed for a static pressure of less than two metres of water or 17.1 kN/m2, in other words the typhoon <b>load</b> on the <b>hatches</b> was more than ten (10) times the design load. The forensic structural analysis of the wreck of the Derbyshire is now widely regarded as irrefutable.|$|R
50|$|The Fokker F.25 Promotor, first {{flown in}} 1946, was a single-engined, twin-boomed, four-passenger {{monoplane}} with a pusher engine mounted {{at the rear}} of a central nacelle. It was of wooden construction and has fitted with a retractable nosewheel undercarriage. One feature of the design was that instead of a 2 + 2 seating, the pilot sat in front to the left, and all three passengers were on a bench seat to the rear of him. Alternatively, when being used as an air ambulance aircraft, it could carry a patient on a stretcher, which was <b>loaded</b> through a <b>hatch</b> in the aircraft's nose. The F.25 was evocative of the pre-war G.I design. The F.25 was based upon the design of the Difoga 421 aircraft, home-built and -designed secretly during World War II by Frits Diepen, a Ford garage owner from Tilburg, the Netherlands. His intention was to escape from German-occupied Europe to Britain using this aircraft that was powered by a Ford V-8.|$|R
