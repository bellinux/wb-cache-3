In theory, the Ba'ath Party would rule, and guide the people, in a transitional period of time without consulting the people because the party knew what was right.|$|E

He holds that while direct action should be tolerated in <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies,</b> this toleration should not extend to certain campaigning tactics used by extremists, such as threat-making.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{aftermath}} of the Cold War is not always easily erased, as many of the economic and social tensions that were exploited to fuel Cold War competition in parts of the Third World remain acute. The breakdown of state control {{in a number of areas}} formerly ruled by communist governments produced new civil and ethnic conflicts, particularly in the former Yugoslavia. In Central and Eastern Europe, the end of the Cold War has ushered in an era of economic growth and an increase in the number of <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies,</b> while in other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, independence was accompanied by state failure.|$|E

5000|$|Reforms and {{revolutions}} helped move most European countries towards <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy.</b> Liberalism ceased being {{a fringe}} opinion {{and joined the}} political mainstream. At the same time, a number of non-liberal ideologies developed that took the concept of <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> and made it their own. The political spectrum changed; traditional monarchy {{became more and more}} a fringe view and <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> became more and more mainstream. By the end of the 19th century, <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> was no longer only a [...] "liberal" [...] idea, but an idea supported by many different ideologies. After World War I and especially after World War II, <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> achieved a dominant position among theories of government and is now endorsed by {{the vast majority of the}} political spectrum.|$|R

25|$|The {{gains of}} {{liberalism}} have been significant. In 1975, roughly 40 {{countries around the}} world were characterised as <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies,</b> but that number had increased to more than 80 as of 2008. Most of the world's richest and most powerful nations are <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies</b> with extensive social welfare programmes. However, liberalism still faces challenges, especially with the phenomenal growth of China as a model combination of authoritarian government and economic liberalism. The Great Recession, which began around 2007, prompted a resurgence in Keynesian economic thought.|$|E
25|$|Authoritarian regimes were {{established}} in the 1930s in Germany, Portugal, Austria, Poland, Greece, the Baltic countries and Spain. By 1940, there were only four <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies</b> left on the European continent: France, Finland, Switzerland and Sweden.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to prove the {{hypothesis}} that <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> could trigger conflict when implemented to a post-conflict country. During the last decades {{there has been a}} debate regarding whether the implementation of liberal peacebuilding and <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> is a mean for peace or a mean for conflict. Researchers arguing for the importance of democracy claims that it is the most peaceful regime and that democracies almost never engage in war. The critics of the <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> argue that the norms and values that characterizes the <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> is not suited for countries with other norms, {{that it is not a}} substantial mean for promoting human development and security and that the peacebuilding efforts of the West simply is a mean to control the world security. I have in this thesis presented the research debate and placed myself amongst the critics of the <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy.</b> The case of Liberia was used to try and prove the hypothesis. The method used is qualitative. I have used a qualitative text analysis as well as the method of process-tracing to process the information. The theories used are the democratic peace theory and the congruence theory. The research questions which I have based my study on are the following; Could the implementation of <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> as a mean for peace, on the contrary bring conflict instead? Was it the <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> that casued a continuation of the conflict in Liberia? The results found is that the transition towards <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> does entail conflictual elements and that there is the possibility of an aggravation of the conflict unless certain factors such as the timing of election and the level of security are thought of. In the case of Liberia there are facts showing that the <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> could have aggravated the conflict, there are however other factors playing a role in this as well and I have therefore not been able to draw the conclusion that my hypothesis is true. Nonetheless I have been able to draw the conclusion that the implementing of <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> is a potential factor behind the continuation of violence in Liberia. The <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> did not create peace as the democratic peace theory suggests. ...|$|R
5000|$|The EPRDF opposes <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy,</b> and {{liberalism}} in general. Despite this, Revolutionary Democracy can {{be considered}} a mixture of communist and liberal thought. The front views <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> and free market capitalism as decadent, and has a [...] "romantic attachment" [...] to the beliefs of Vladimir Lenin, who condemned <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> as the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie (literally the dictatorship of the upper class) while supporting Lenin's assertion of the need for a vanguard party which practices democratic centralism. It considers <b>liberal</b> <b>democracy</b> to be [...] "ill-fit and unsustainable", but ironically much of the front's economic policies are based on the tacit acknowledgement of the need of some liberalism in the economic field.|$|R

25|$|French {{philosophers}} {{produced some}} of the most important political works of the Age of Enlightenment. In The Spirit of the Laws, Baron de Montesquieu theorised the principle of separation of powers, which has been implemented in all <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies</b> since it was first applied in the United States. In The Social Contract, Jean-Jacques Rousseau openly criticised the European divine right monarchies and strongly affirmed the principle of the sovereignty of the people. Voltaire came to embody the Enlightenment with his defence of civil liberties, such as the right to a free trial and freedom of religion.|$|E

The United States {{and the majority of}} European <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies</b> at the time (United Kingdom, France, Italy, Netherlands, West Germany etc.) established the NATO military alliance. Later, the Soviet Union and its satellites in Europe (Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Romania) established the Warsaw Pact as a counterpoint to NATO. Each alliance was intended to defend against a potential invasion by the other.|$|E

If they cannot call such meetings they are not democracies.” Castro continued “Those who want to see people’s democracy let them come here and see this. We can speak to America and the world because we speak in names of a whole nation.” In this 1960 speech, Castro also criticized many Latin American <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies,</b> describing them as a “Pretense of democracy”, as, he claimed, they did not allow such gatherings.|$|E

25|$|By 1959, Cuba was {{afflicted with}} a corrupt {{dictatorship}} under Batista, and Fidel Castro ousted Batista {{that year and}} set up the first communist state in the hemisphere. The United States imposed a trade embargo on Cuba, and combined with Castro's expropriation of private enterprises, this was detrimental to the Cuban economy. Around Latin America, rural guerrilla conflict and urban terrorism increased, inspired by the Cuban example. The United States put down these rebellions by supporting Latin American countries in their counter guerrilla operations through the Alliance for Progress launched by President John F. Kennedy. This thrust appeared to be successful. A Marxist, Salvador Allende, became president of Chile in 1970, but was overthrown three years later in a military coup backed by the United States. Despite civil war, high crime and political instability, most Latin American countries eventually adopted bourgeois <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies</b> while Cuba maintained its socialist system.|$|E
25|$|Seeking {{improved}} international relations, in 1934 the Soviet Union secured {{membership of}} the League of Nations, of which it had previously been excluded. Stalin initiated confidential communications with Hitler in October 1933, shortly after the latter {{came to power in}} Germany. Stalin admired Hitler, particularly the latter's manoeuvres to remove rivals within the Nazi Party in the Night of the Long Knives. He nevertheless recognised the threat posed by fascism and sought to establish better links with the <b>liberal</b> <b>democracies</b> of Western Europe; in May 1935, the Soviets signed a treaty of mutual assistance with France and Czechoslovakia. At the Communist International's 7th Congress, held in July–August 1935, the Soviet government encouraged Marxist-Leninists to unite with other leftists as part of a popular front against fascism. In turn, the anti-communist governments of Germany, Fascist Italy and Japan sought to counter the influence of the international communist movement with the Anti-Comintern Pact of 1936. When the Spanish Civil War broke out the same year, the Soviets sent 648 aircraft and 407 tanks to the left-wing Republican faction; these were accompanied by 3000 Soviet troops and 42,000 members of the International Brigades set up by the Communist International. Stalin took a strong personal involvement in the Spanish situation. Germany and Italy backed the Nationalist faction, which was ultimately victorious in March 1939.|$|E
