500|$|Differing from Survivor in that {{previously}} Beyoncé {{had taken an}} active role in writing and producing, Destiny Fulfilled saw each member contributing inputs culled from personal experiences and individual opinions and points of view not dependent from the others'. In most cases, producers of the album would send them a CD containing a track that would be the group's basis in the songwriting process; without the producer's supervision of which part to sing, that formed a new direction of their style different from their previous records. The traditional approach where each member sang one verse and chimed in the chorus was replaced; in some songs in Destiny Fulfilled, their vocals were alternated in every line of the lyrics, a technique similar to hip hop artists. Destiny's Child took the role of executive producing alongside their manager, Mathew Knowles. Beyoncé, who vocally produced the songs, commented that it was important for her to make sure their voices were audible and identifiable. Taking it as one of her goals, the group decided to focus on mid-tempo songs and on few dance numbers and ballads—which they considered people cannot sing with. Beyoncé elaborated [...] "We {{wanted to make sure that}} the songs would be something that we were proud of 10 years from now, 20 years from now. We wanted it to be something that people can really feel an emotion to. Up-tempo songs can do that, but they more make you wanna dance." [...] As Rowland was recently engaged in the time of the writing of the album, it further influenced her songwriting. She also cited that being apart from the group affected the album as well: [...] "All of us have been in three different places... so there's a <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> a lot that's gone on, personally. I think it's important to talk about that on this new record, to put what we've been going through separately into the new record." ...|$|E

50|$|There were 139 {{competitors}} for {{the second}} event.

Climbing up the Deception River, the weather deteriorated. Competitors who were slower faced ever higher water levels and could not undertake the many river crossings by themselves, but had to wait for others to link arms.

Despite the conditions, John Howard finished the first day 10 minutes faster than the 1983 winner's time; Howard had missed the event the previous year as he wanted to save himself for a major triathlon a week later in the United States (which, due to an administrative bungle, he could not get to).|$|R

It was co-produced by Tommy McClendon with additional production {{being done by}} Dem Jointz. Mixing was done by Serban Ghenea and John Hanes served as the song's engineer. It is a mid-tempo R&B song, with its instrumentation consisting in a thumping bass and a subdued [...] "funky" [...] beat, having a [...] "distinctive Janet sound", according to some critics, and a soul-sample, while Jackson's vocals were considered [...] "breezy" [...] and [...] "soulful". It starts with [...] "a melodic almost a cappella intro, with Janet singing, [...] "I lived through my mistakes, it's {{just a part of}} growing," [...] before it [...] "segways into a legit bop." [...] Its pre-chorus is [...] "full of rich harmonies that give a retro—dare we say Jackson 5—vibe," [...] noted Fuse Mark Sundstrom. Towards the end, as described by Music Times' Carolyn Menyes, [...] "with a knowing wink, Jackson gives a spoken outro against some finger snaps. 'Hello. It's been a while. <b>Lots</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about.</b> I'm glad you're still here. I dedicate myself to you. I hope you enjoy,' she says, directly addressing the listeners who have waited so long for a taste of new Jackson music." [...] Lyrically, [...] "Unbreakable" [...] is a dedication to her fans, with Janet expressing thankfulness and praising her loyal fan base and a lover, with lines like, [...] "Never for a single moment did I ever go without your love" [...] and [...] "You made me feel wanted, and I want to tell you how important you are to me." [...] Lewis, one of its producers, commented about its lyrical content, saying, [...] "Some people think of unbreakable as being hard, but I think unbreakable is just being able to be vulnerable {{and to be able to}} withstand what comes to you.

For these two days he was {{as much as he could}} be with papa, accompanying him in his drives and rides, and I could see by papa's manner that he really liked him very much. To me he was very nice, not at all showing me any marked attention so as to be perceptible to any one else; and yet I could feel there was something different in his tone of voice and manner when he addressed me to what he used when he spoke to others.

[...] "She consoles herself, however," [...] Ada said, [...] "with the conclusion, that there are even better matches to be made than the one I refused, and that I must have set my mind on being a duchess; for that any idea of love is necessary for a marriage, is a matter which never entered her mind." [...] Ada was a little bitter upon the subject, and I was sorry to see she was likely to have disputes with her mother upon the point; for there was no doubt that Lady Desborough was a very worldly woman, and I was quite sure that Ada, although at times thoughtless and fond of admiration, would never marry any one, however high his rank, to whom she had not given her heart.|$|R

I'm not trying to supplement my lifestyle with music. I love music and I play music everyday, whether it's my piano, or making a song. It's the same with Football, I get paid well to play Football, because I'm blessed <b>to</b> have a <b>lot</b> of skill, but I could never be this good without loving the game...

It's hard for a <b>lot</b> of people <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> emotions that are really deep pain and hurt and shit like that. [...] "Them Bones" [...] is pretty cut and dried. It's a little sarcastic, but it's pretty much about dealing with your mortality and life. Everybody's going to die someday. Instead of being afraid of it, that's the way it is: so enjoy the time you've got. Live as much as you can, have as much fun as possible. Face your fear and live. I had family members die at a fairly early age; so I've always had kind of a phobia about it. Death freaks me out. I think it freaks a lot of people out.

30|$|In addition, {{using new}} {{expressions}} and words is another linguistic factor which appeared progressive for low-anxious students and debilitating for the highly anxious ones. The teacher or peers’ negative judgment {{can be one}} of the affective factors which may heighten learners’ anxiety. Thus, having good relations with other students in the class mitigates negative judgments and contributes to decreasing learners’ anxiety. Besides, pedagogical contextual factors and tools used for learning affect learners’ anxiety. Teachers’ negative reaction to the learners’ mistakes make them feel embarrassed that they prefer not <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> in the class. The level of learners’ self-confidence influences their level of anxiety since learners with low self-confidence feel anxious <b>to</b> <b>talk.</b> In contrast, confident learners are eager to speak and they learn from their mistakes. EFL learners’ anxiety might be impressed by their self-perception of their English language. Besides, the background knowledge of students, and lack of topical knowledge affected their anxiety as familiarity with the topics of conversations decreases their anxiety. At the time of speaking, they have a <b>lot</b> of ideas <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> in their mind in their native languages, but they have no idea how to put them; thus, they abstain <b>to</b> <b>talk.</b> This study suggested that cognitive, linguistic, and affective factors are important in the moment-by-moment rise and fall of learners’ anxiety.|$|R
