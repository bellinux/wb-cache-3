40|$|Bacteriophage induces {{profound}} changes in Vibrio cholerae either by <b>lysogenisation</b> or by selection of resistant mutants (Mukerjee, 1983). These changes may involve pathogenic traits, e. g., <b>lysogenisation</b> with temperate phage obtained from an epidemic strain GS 9 (Mukerjee, 1983) may impart virulence to V. cholerae EW 6, a non-virulent strain that carries a non-functional toxin operon (Bhattacharyya et al., 1987). Not {{all of the}} virulence factors of V. cholerae have yet been characterised (Lancet, 1986), al-though lipopolysaccharide antigens and outer- membrane proteins, which are conspicuously im-munogenic in cholera patients (Pierce, 1984), are considered important in the pathogenesis of the disease (Manning et al., 1986). Some of these antigens are routinely used in serological character- isation of V. cholerae isolates. In recent years, phage-induced changes in V. cholerae have been characterised at the serological level (Ogg et al., 1978; Shigeno, 1982; Siddiqui and Bhattacharyya, 1984). This paper describes mutants of V. cholerae strain MAK 757 resistant to a newly- isolated vibrio phage PS 166 and their serological characterisation. ...|$|E

40|$|THE PRODUCTION of coagulase {{is universally}} {{accepted}} {{as the most}} distinctive characteristic of Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, among the numerous extracellular proteins com-monly associated with staphylococcal virulence, coagulase {{seems to be the}} most stably associated. Recently we have developed a technique whereby it is readily possible to detect one colony that produces coagulase among 30 OOO coagulase-negative colonies by means of a pour-plate technique (parisi, Baldwin and Sottile, 1973). Coagulase-producing colonies in the agar can be detected by the dense zone of precipitated fibrin around them. This technique makes feasible certain types of genetic studies on production and regulation of coagulase, as well as studies of other aspects of its possible role in staphylococcal disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacteriaf strains. A coagulase-negative mutant was obtained from strain 1 - 746 after exposure of the culture to 100 pg of N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (Aldrich Chemical Co. Inc., Milwaukee, Wis.) per ml of 0. 1 ~ phosphate buffer, pH 7. 0. Transduction experi-ments were done with the coagulase-negative mutant of strain 1 - 746 and with a lysogenic variant of this mutant strain. Both parent and mutant, before <b>lysogenisation,</b> were susceptible to lysis by phages 80 and 81 of the International Basic Set of staphylococcal phages. Upon <b>lysogenisation,</b> the coagulase-negative mutant was untypable. The S. aweus strains listed in the table were used in the curing experiments.

40|$|Subclonal {{analysis}} of spontaneous zygogenesis (Z-mating) products of Escherichia coli K 12 was undertaken {{to grasp the}} extent of vertical and horizontal evolution in unstable strains expressing one parental or recombinant genome. Isolates were obtained following serial cultures or serial intercrosses. A high diversity of strains was obtained, among which some resumed the phenotype of the partners of the initial or subsequent Z-matings. When non-complementing diploids are infected {{with a mixture of}} distinct temperate bacteriophages, <b>lysogenisation</b> occurs at the expenses of the active chromosome only. This event is associated with an alternate expression of prophage and chromosomal genes. Present work provides further evidence for the existence of non-complementing diploidy and opens a novel route for virus research in general. SCOPUS: le. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY. Three {{hundred and}} seventy-one penicillin-resistant Staphy-lococcus aureus strains of phage type 95 {{isolated}} in the years 1977 - 1983 were investigated. They had characteristic resistance patterns to cad-mium (Cd), arsenate (As) and mercury (Hg). Most were susceptible to all three heavy metals; 25 strains were resistant to As only and one to Cd and As. The susceptible strains had a uniform medium level of penicillinase production, whereas the As-resistant strains produced large amounts of penicillinase. In most of the strains, penicillin resistance was located on a very unstable penicillinase plasmid. The combinaton of rare properties found in Danish type- 95 strains seems {{to point to the}} spread of one or two clones. Co-reactions with other phage groups or complexes and results of <b>lysogenisation</b> experi-ments suggest that the Danish type- 95 strains are derived from strains of the 52, 52 A, 80, 81 complex...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTwenty two {{distinct}} bacteriophages were isolated from sewage water from five {{locations in the}} city of Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire over a two-year period, using a collection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains with diverse genotypes. The phages were characterized by their virulence spectrum on a panel of selected P. aeruginosa strains from cystic fibrosis patients and by whole genome sequencing. Twelve virions representing the observed diversity were visualised by electron microscopy. The combined observations showed that 17 phages, distributed into seven genera, were virulent, and that five phages were related to temperate phages belonging to three genera. Some showed similarity with known phages only at the protein level. The vast majority of the genetic variations among virulent phages from the same genus resulted from seemingly non-random horizontal transfer events, inside a population of P. aeruginosa phages with limited diversity. This suggests the existence of a single environmental reservoir or ecotype in which continuous selection is taking place. In contrast, mostly point mutations were observed among phages potentially capable of <b>lysogenisation.</b> This is the first study of P. aeruginosa phage diversity in an African city and it shows that a large variety of phage species can be recovered in a limited geographical site at least when different bacterial strains are used. The relative temporal and spatial stability of the Abidjan phage population might reflect equilibrium in the microbial community from which they are released...|$|E
40|$|INFLUENCE OF LATERALLY ACQUIRED GENETIC ELEMENTS ON THE PHYSIOLOGY OF SALMONELLA ENTERICA Salmonella spp. are {{accountable}} {{for a large}} fraction of the global infectious disease burden, with most of their infections being food- or water-borne. As the phenotypic features and adaptive potential of Salmonella spp. appear to be driven mainly by mobile or laterally acquired genetic elements, {{a better understanding of}} the behaviour and diversification of these important pathogens consequently requires a more profound insight into the different mechanisms by which these pivotal elements can affect cellular physiology. In this work, research was accordingly focused on the impact of a laterally acquired endonuclease (i. e. Mrr), and a temperate bacteriophage (i. e. P 22) on the physiology of Salmonella Typhimurium LT 2. Mrr is a cryptic Type IV restriction endonuclease that is characterized by its specificity for modified DNA. The gene encoding Mrr is located in the immigration control region, a foreign genetic element that harbours a large number of restriction systems. In contrast to the Mrr protein of its close relative, Escherichia coli MG 1655, we initially found Mrr of LT 2 to be inactive. Closer analysis, however, revealed that degeneration of LT 2 Mrr might have been enforced by the presence of a laterally acquired Type III methyltransferase in LT 2, whose activity in the cell is incompatible with a functional Mrr enzyme. Nevertheless, random mutagenesis revealed that a number of seemingly unrelated mutations could each still render LT 2 Mrr constitutively active, indicating its degeneration is readily reversible. P 22, on the other hand, is a temperate and Salmonella-specific model phage that over the last 50 years has greatly contributed to our understanding of phage biology and phage  host interactions in general. Using a random promoter-trap library, we stumbled upon a novel interaction between P 22 and LT 2, which is characterized by the deliberate redirection of the hosts metabolism. Interestingly, we could identify the actual instigator of this interaction as a small ORFan protein encoded on the P 22 genome, but its deletion did not obviously affect infection or <b>lysogenisation</b> by P 22. In summary, the research in this work revealed a number of novel mechanisms by which specific mobile or laterally acquired genetic elements can determine or interfere with the behaviour of S. Typhimurium. status: publishe...|$|E
