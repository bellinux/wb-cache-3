40|$|Background: <b>Light</b> <b>injury</b> to {{photoreceptor}} {{cells and}} {{retinal pigment epithelium}} may lead to oxidative stress and irreversible degeneration of retina, especially degeneration of the high energy-demanded macula. The model of retinal photodamage {{could be applied to}} age-related macular degeneration and other degenerative retinal diseases for exploring new treatments. Based on broadly investigated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) in the field of retinal degeneration, we aimed to clarify further how the interaction progresses between iPSC-conditional medium (CM) and light-damaged retina. Methods: iPSCs were generated from murine embryonic fibroblasts of C 57 /B 6 mice by retroviral transfection of three factors: Oct 4, Sox 2, and Klf 4. Cytokine array was performed to analyze the components of CM. Sprague–Dawley rats receiving white light exposure to retina were viewed as an animal model of <b>light</b> <b>injury.</b> The rats were divided into four subgroups: light-injured rats receiving intravitreal injection of iPSC-CM, apoptotic iPSC-CM, or sodium phosphate buffer (PBS); and a control group without light damage. The electroretinography and thickness of outer nuclear layer were measured to document the therapeutic effects in each condition. Apoptosis arrays for detecting annexin V and caspase 3 were performed in the retinal tissues from each group. Results: Murine embryonic fibroblasts were induced into iPSCs and expressed the marker genes similar to embryonic stem cells. These iPSCs can differentiate into Embryoid bodies (EBs), three germ layers in vitro and develop teratoma in severe combined immunodeficiency mice. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction of our iPSC-CM showed significantly elevated fibroblast growth factor- 2, glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor, and insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins- 1, - 2, and - 3. Compared to rats without photodamage, the light-injured rats receiving iPSC-CM had less reduction of outer nuclear layer thickness on Day 21 than other groups treated with either PBS or apoptotic iPSC-CM. In the same animal model, both a- and b-waves of electroretinography measurement in the group treated with iPSC-CM were significantly maintained compared to the control group and others with apoptotic iPSC-CM or PBS treatment. The apoptosis assay also demonstrated lower levels of annexin V and caspase 3 in the group with iPSC-CM treatment than in other groups presenting increasing apoptotic markers. Conclusion: The conditional medium of iPSCs contains plenty of cytoprotective, immune-modulative and rescue chemicals, contributing to the maintenance of neuronal function and retinal layers in light-damaged retina compared with apoptotic iPSC-CM and PBS. The antiapoptotic effect of iPSC-CM also shows promise in restoring damaged neurons. This result demonstrates that iPSC-CM may serve as an alternative to cell therapy alone to treat retinal light damage and maintain functional and structural integrity of the retina...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the protective effects of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) against UV irradiation of cultured human lens epithelial cells. Methods: We irradiated cultured human lens epithelial cells with a 30 -second pulse from a UV lamp with an irradiance of 0. 6 mW/cm 2. Five minutes and 1 hour after UV irradiation, we administered 0, 5, 10, 15, 25, 50, or 100 uM EGCG. The cell number {{was measured with}} a microscopic counting chamber and cell viability was evaluated using the 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Results: Compared to untreated cells, {{the total number of}} cultured human lens epithelial cells was markedly higher after UV irradiation. In a dose-dependent manner, viability was also higher in EGCG-treated cells.

40|$|Degeneration of {{the human}} retinal {{pigmented}} epithelium (hRPE) is involved in several eye disorders such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In this study, we investigated the protective effect of IGF- 1 on human primary cultured RPE cells and its underlying mechanism. IGF- 1 dose- and time-dependently promoted the survival of RPE cells from serum deprivation. Western blot showed that IGF- 1 stimulated the activation of the PI 3 K/Akt and MAPK pathways in hRPE. Inhibition of the PI 3 K/Akt pathway by the PI 3 K-specific inhibitor, LY 294002 or inhibition of Akt by Akt-specific inhibitors Akt inhibitor VIII or SN- 38, or downregulation Akt with siRNA specific for Akt blocked the effect of IGF- 1 on hRPE. In contrast, blockade of the MAPK pathway with a specific inhibitor PD 98059 had no effect. Interestingly, vitreous IGF- 1 injection reversed the inhibitory effect of light exposure (a dry AMD model) on both a wave and b wave. Immunocytochemistry showed that vitreous IGF- 1 injections promoted the survival of RPE cells in rat retina and the expression of RPE 65 in RPE cells from <b>light</b> <b>injury.</b> These results indicate that IGF- 1 is able to protect hRPE cell from different insults in vivo and in vitro.

40|$|Research in {{road safety}} faces major challenges: {{individuation}} {{of the most}} significant determinants of traffic accidents, recognition of the most recurrent accident patterns, and allocation of resources necessary to address the most relevant issues. This paper intends to comprehend which data mining techniques appear more suitable for the objective of providing a broad picture of the road safety situation and individuating specific problems that the allocation of resources should address first. Descriptive (i. e., K-means and Kohonen clustering) and predictive (i. e., decision trees, neural networks and association rules) data mining techniques are implemented for the analysis of traffic accidents occurred in Israel between 2001 and 2004. Results show that descriptive techniques are useful to classify the large amount of analyzed accidents, even though introduce problems with respect to the clear-cut definition of the clusters and the triviality of the description of the main accident characteristics. Results also show that prediction techniques present problems with respect to the large number of rules produced by decision trees, the interpretation of neural network results in terms of relative importance of input and intermediate neurons, and the relative importance of hundreds of association rules. Further research should investigate whether limiting the analysis to fatal accidents would simplify the task of data mining techniques in recognizing accident patterns without the “noise” probably created by considering also severe and <b>light</b> <b>injury</b> accidents...|$|E
