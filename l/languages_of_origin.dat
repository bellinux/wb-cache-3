40|$|The {{tendency}} {{of a single}} world market to privilege the translation of English fiction and poetry into other languages for reading or listening enjoyment may damage the production of world literature and in this respect make us all worse off. In order to develop this thesis, the article begins with an economic model {{of the market for}} imaginative works in which translations are systematically concentrated on writings in the original language with the largest share in world sales. The model is then shown to agree with the facts. Next, it is argued that high concentration of translations on works coming from one particular language hurts the production of literature directly, because variety of <b>languages</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> is enriching as such, and indirectly, because the concentration damages the incentives of those who do not write in the leading language to invest in their own talents.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} stress {{assignation}} for unknown foreign words read aloud by Scottish subjects. The syllable structure and syllable {{weight of the}} written words is examined, to determine where stress {{is most likely to}} be placed according to English stress rules, and the stress rules for the <b>languages</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> of the words are also described. The stress patterns in the spoken responses are then analysed to determine the influence of syllable weight (both written and spoken), and the perceived language of origin of the word. Applicability of the findings to a wider context is discussed. 1 Introduction `The stress rules of English are first of all riddled with exceptions and secondly fail the simplest attempts to confirm them directly, in many cases.

For this, links need to be discovered which exist between European languages and <b>languages</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> Firstly, all languages are not important. A social hierarchy exists which depends on the context of elocution. Multilingualism was gradually developed during the 20 th century but all bilingualisms are not considered as a resource. Bilingualism related to immigration is often synonymous with handicap and deficit of integration which justifies a certain essentialisation of the language. However, language learning depends partly on its social value in the host country and the country of origin. This social recognition rests for example on the fact that it concerns an oral or written language; a religious language, an international language, etc. This article thus aims at understanding the European and national language policies set up to support the mobility of individuals and their entry into new territories. INTERACT is co-financed by the European University Institute and the European Union...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} language use among a relatively young immigrant community in Britain with a view to finding out what role English plays in their lives, whether they still use their <b>languages</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> and what are the reasons for their particular language behaviour. Language use and maintenance in an immigrant minority setting is an important area of investigation if one is to understand some of the factors involved in the community's integration process, or the lack of it, in general, and to appreciate the role of language for integration in particular. Minority communities adopt a number of linguistic strategies for communication among themselves and their wider community. In most cases, these linguistic strategies are dictated by both the social and linguistic environment the immigrant minority finds itself living in. The thesis first looks at the sociolinguistic situation of Morocco in order to establish the linguistic background of this community. It then considers the British Moroccans from a socio-economic perspective with a view to identifying factors that may influence language shift behaviour. The empirical part of the thesis is concerned with establishing linguistic as well as non-linguistic determinants of language maintenance such as those that influence language choice, code-switching, attitudes and use of language-specific media. The study has two main hypotheses: first, the Moroccan community in Britain is undergoing a generational language shift, and second, typical Moroccan sociolinguistic patterns are reflected in the language use of Moroccan speakers in Britain as well. While the former hypothesis has, on the whole, proved correct, the latter did not hold true. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
