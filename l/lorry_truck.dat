50|$|Development of a tank {{classification}} system started in World War I, when tanks were separated into light tanks and tankettes, medium tanks, and heavy tanks, based on size and weight. Heavy tanks {{were required to}} be large to cross trenches, and consequently weighed a lot. Medium tanks were smaller and had help to cross trenches so weighed less. Light tanks were much smaller and lightweight, allowing transport on <b>lorries</b> (<b>trucks).</b>|$|R
50|$|A steam wagon (steam lorry or steam waggon) is a steam-powered {{road vehicle}} for {{carrying}} freight. It was the earliest form of <b>lorry</b> (<b>truck)</b> {{and came in}} two basic forms: overtype and undertype - the distinction being {{the position of the}} engine relative to the boiler. Manufacturers tended to concentrate on one form or the other.|$|E

50|$|The Bedford OY is an army <b>lorry</b> (<b>truck)</b> {{built by}} Bedford for the British Armed Forces and {{introduced}} in 1939. It {{was based on}} Bedford's O-series commercial vehicles with a modified front end and single rear tyres. It was designed for a 3-ton payload. The OYD was a general service vehicle, while the OYC was a tanker version for carrying water or petrol. These vehicles were widely used during, and after, World War II but were later superseded by the Bedford RL.|$|E
40|$|An {{automatic}} {{road toll}} system enables the passing vehicles to change lanes and no stop {{is needed for}} payment. Because of different weight of personal cars, busses, <b>lorries</b> (<b>trucks)</b> and other vehicles, they affect the road in different ways. It is of interest to categorize the vehicles into different classes depending of their weight so that the right fee can be set. An automatic road toll system developed by Combitech Traffic Systems AB (now Kapsch TrafficCom AB), Joenkoping, Sweden, classifies the vehicles with help of a so called height image. This is a three dimensional image produced by two photographs of a vehicle. The photographs displays the same view but are mounted with a little spacing. This spacing {{makes it possible to}} create a height image. The existing classification uses only length, width and height to divide vehicles into classes. Vehicles of the same dimensions would then belong to the same class independent of their weight. An important example is busses and <b>lorries</b> (<b>trucks)</b> which often have the same dimensions, but trucks often have greater weight and should therefore require a larger fee. This work describes methods for separating busses from lorries with the help of height images. The methods search for variations in the width and height, and other features specific for busses and lorries respectively...|$|R

50|$|In Europe (particularly Britain) many {{manufacturing}} towns developed {{before the}} railway. Many factories {{did not have}} direct rail access. This meant that freight had to be shipped through a goods station, sent by train and unloaded at another goods station for onward delivery to another factory. When <b>lorries</b> (<b>trucks)</b> replaced horses it was often economical and faster to make one movement by road. In the United States, particularly in the West and Mid-West towns developed with railway and factories often had a direct rail connection. Despite the closure of many minor lines carload shipping from one company to another by rail remains common.|$|R

It is the main centre for linking other districts via bus routes, especially to the North side (Salem, Villupuram, Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri, Bangalore), East side (Tiruchirapalli, Thanjavur), South side (Karur, Dindugal, Madurai, Tiunelveli, Kanyakumari) and the West side (Erode, Coimbatore, Tirupur, Udhagamandalam (Ooty)) ...|$|E
