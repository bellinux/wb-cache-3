5000|$|Five {{days later}} Miss <b>Lemon</b> <b>spots</b> an {{announcement}} in the [...] "personal column" [...] of The Morning Post {{about the death}} of Miss Barrowby. Poirot sends a letter to Rosebank to provoke a response from the next of kin, and he duly receives a reply from Mary Delafontaine, the dead woman's niece, saying that his services are no longer required. Nevertheless, he goes to the house and admires the well-maintained garden with its spring flowers and edging of shells. Let into the house by a maid, the first person he meets is a young Russian girl called Katrina Reiger, who speaks cryptically of the money that by rights is hers. She is interrupted by Mrs Delafontaine and her husband who dismiss Katrina and meet Poirot. They seem shocked to find that he is a detective.|$|R

5000|$|Hedlund started [...] in the Royals' rotation, {{but after}} {{starting}} the season 0-5, was {{moved into the}} bullpen. He improved considerably at that point; winning his next four starts when used by manager Bob <b>Lemon</b> as a <b>spot</b> starter. At the 1972 Winter meetings he was traded back to the Cleveland Indians for utility infielder Kurt Bevacqua.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 22 mm. The forewings are dark violaceous brown {{with a round}} <b>lemon</b> yellow <b>spot</b> on the costal edge near the base, followed by a large reddish-yellow spot, edged by dark velvety brown scales. There is a small yellow dot within {{the middle of the}} dorsal edge, and some diffused reddish and dark-brown streaks on the cell. Two indistinct and suffused, whitish, zigzag lines are found across the wing at the apical third and the extreme costal edge, a small spot at the apical third of the costa and the extreme apex are all light yellow. The hindwings are dark fuscous.|$|R

"He {{turned away}} and went below, and the skipper arter reading us all a little lecture on getting into fights without reason, sent the two chaps below agin and told ’em to turn in and rest. He was so good to ’em all the way ’ome, and took sich a {{interest}} in seeing ’em change from black to brown and from light brown to <b>spotted</b> <b>lemon,</b> that the mate daren’t do nothing to them, but gave us their share of what he owed them, {{as well as an}} extra dose of our own." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{discovery}} was announced by del Rio {{in the journal}} of the Mexico city School of Mining. The news spread by reading that journal and a direct letters of del Rio. In the subsequent years several times the {{discovery was}} mentioned.One of the earliest notes of the discovery is a translation of a letter of del Rio to Freiesleben. In 1839 it was described as <b>lemon</b> coloured <b>spots</b> in the sandstone of Casas Vijecas. This description was also given in a Spanish book printed in 1844. In 1836 a short paper was published in Comptes rendus which was the communication of Yniestra to Arago about a discovery of del Rio. In this publication the mineral sample was deposited at the school of mines by a Mr. Jose Casas Viejas from the Querétaro province and that the mineral had a red brown colour. [...] In 1861 the book A glossary of mineralogy by Henry William Bristow states that it has been found in Casas Viejas in Mexico as reddish brown particles on mercury selenide. Shortly after in 1862 a book about chemical technology gives the only location where the mineral can be found with a Mexican region Cavas Viejas.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{elevated}} atmospheric CO₂ mixing ratios on Biogenic Volatile Organic Compound emissions from Corymbia citriodora (<b>Lemon</b> Scented Gum, <b>Spotted</b> Gum) and Tristaniopsis laurina (Water Gum or Kanooka) was determined {{for the first}} time through the combination of Solid-Phase Microextraction (SPME), Gas Chromatography-Flame Ionisation Detection (GC-FID) and an environment chamber. For C. citriodora, elevated atmospheric CO₂ led to a decrease in the emission rate of α-pinene, β-pinene, eucalyptol, citronellal and β-caryophyllene. Elevated CO₂ had no effect on the emission rate of citronellol. For T. laurina, elevated CO₂ led to a decrease in the emission rate of α-pinene but the emission rates of β-pinene, limonene, eucalyptol and citronellol were unaffected. The results obtained in this work confirm that the effect of elevated atmospheric CO₂ on plant BVOC emissions is species-specific. 7 page(s...|$|R
