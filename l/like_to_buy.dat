2500|$|With {{the coming}} of the Internet, in 1994 Amazon devised a service system of on-line {{retailing}} and distribution.

[...] This required not only very large computer operations, but dispersed warehouses, and an efficient transportation system.

It is the customer being in the system during the production and delivery of the service that distinguishes all services from manufacturing.|$|E

If a club has a policy of setting a drink minimum per visit or per hour, the floor staff also assists in enforcing those rules.

40|$|Consumer {{behaviour}} when purchasing wine is {{the result}} of a complementary operation of the large number of different factors, which may include economic, geographic, social, psychological, and other. Discovering consumer preferences for wine and their buying behavior would allow the application of an appropriate marketing strategy to increase the sales of wine. Special attention was given to one of the most promising new demographic segments that <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> – Millennial generation. The main purpose of this research is to find out if the wine attributes of the Millennials are different from other generations in southern Serbia. Results of this research are shown that when choosing wine, the quality of wine has the biggest impact on consumers, rather than others wine attributes. The paper also asserts that, the wine industry should particularly focus on marketing to Millennial age group, as this segment has a high willingness to experiment...|$|R

He first settled in San Francisco and built up a following by performing faith healings across the state. His ministry, the International Divine Healing Association, was run largely as a commercial enterprise. All members were expected to tithe and, if they did, were eligible to request Dowie's aid in healing their ills. Such requests were made by mail or telegram (or later, by phone). Dowie would then pray in response to requests by paid-up members. Although Dowie funded his lifestyle largely through tithes, he also <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> up securities of bankrupt companies and sell them off to his constituents. Unfortunately for Dowie, two women whom he had defrauded in this way took him to court and successfully sued him. In this aftermath of this legal and public relations defeat, Dowie moved to Chicago in 1890.|$|R

40|$|Autonomous {{vehicles}} (AVs) should reduce traffic accidents, {{but they}} will sometimes {{have to choose between}} two evils, such as running over pedestrians or sacrificing themselves and their passenger to save the pedestrians.

We found that participants in six Amazon Mechanical Turk studies approved of utilitarian AVs (that is, AVs that sacrifice their passengers for the greater good) and would <b>like</b> others <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> them, but they would themselves prefer to ride in AVs that protect their passengers at all costs. The study participants disapprove of enforcing utilitarian regulations for AVs and would be less willing <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> such an AV. Accordingly, regulating for utilitarian algorithms may paradoxically increase casualties by postponing the adoption of a safer technology...|$|R

But she had her way about their own movements, and they began that life of hotels, which they had now lived so long that she believed any other impossible. Its luxury and idleness had told upon each of them with diverse effect.|$|R
