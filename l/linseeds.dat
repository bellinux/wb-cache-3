2500|$|Rugbrød (...) (Danish style rye bread) is a {{very common}} bread in Denmark. Rugbrød usually resembles a long brown {{extruded}} rectangle, no more than 12cm high, and 30–35cm wide, dependent upon the bread pan {{in which it is}} baked. The ingredients typically include rye flour, cracked or chopped rye kernels and seeds such as sunflower seeds, <b>linseeds</b> or pumpkin seeds. Sourdough is almost always the base because commercial yeasts are unsuitable. The naturally fermented dough will develop a naturally occurring Lactobacillus culture in symbiotic combination with naturally present yeasts. It is essential [...] in baking rye-based breads because the chemistry of rye flour produces an environment that is acidic. The most commonly present yeast species in the production of naturally leavened dough is Saccharomyces exiguus, which is more acid-tolerant than commercially produced S. cerevisiae, although the latter and other strains may also be present. Research has shown that when creating a naturally fermented starter, any naturally present S. cerevisiae will have died off after a few days.|$|E

Disappearance of C 18 : 3 n- 3 was measured to estimate the fractional biohydrogenation rate and lag time according to an exponential model and to calculate effective biohydrogenation of C 18 : 3 n- 3, assuming a fractional passage rate of 0. 060 /h. Treatments showed no differences in rumen fermentation parameters, including gas production rate and volatile fatty acid concentration. Technological pretreatment (crushing) followed by chemical treatment applied as formaldehyde of <b>linseed</b> resulted in effective protection of C 18 : 3 n- 3 against biohydrogenation. Additional chemical pretreatment (sodium hydroxide) before applying formaldehyde treatment did not further improve the effectiveness of protection.

The third officer found the necessary charts and the Monte Nevoso proceeded towards the East coast of England.

40|$|<b>Linseeds</b> {{are used}} in {{ruminant}} feeding for a long time, but this feedstuff knows now increasing interest. <b>Linseeds</b> are rich in alpha-linolenic acid, a fatty acid from the omega- 3 series. Despite an extensive biohydrogenation of dietary alpha-linolenic acid in the rumen, its concentration in milk and beef meat increases with linseed incorporation in diets; this increase is accompanied by that of other fatty acids produced during biohydrogenation, especially conjugated linoleic acids and trans 18 : 1 fatty acids. The increase in cow fertility due to omega- 3 fatty acids has not been demonstrated. Furthermore, linseed incorporation in ruminant diets {{is one of the}} most efficient ways to decrease enteric methane emissions. In addition to a global mitigating effect of all lipid sources on methane, <b>linseeds</b> have a specific effect due to changes in rumen microbial ecosystem. The practical use of <b>linseeds</b> in ruminant feeding at a large scale requires the absence of negative effect at any step of the ruminant production system. An excessive supply of lipids from <b>linseeds</b> can have deleterious effects on digestive efficiency, milk fat and protein content, beef susceptibility to oxidation, milk and beef fatty acid composition, but when linseed incorporation in the diet does not exceed ca. 3 % of additional fat, only positive effects are remaining. A challenge is the increase in linseed cropping to meet increased needs for animal feeding...|$|E

30|$|There {{are four}} {{varieties}} of <b>linseed</b> oil {{sold in the}} market, including raw, boiled, stand and refined <b>linseed</b> oils. Raw <b>linseed</b> oil refers to pure oil with no additional treatment and with no additives, while boiled <b>linseed</b> oil is produced by adding a mixture of hydrocarbon solvents and metallic dryers to speed its drying time. Boiled oil is a well known trade name, even though the process does not involve boiling of raw oil, whereas the stand <b>linseed</b> oil is processed by heating the oil to about 300 °C, over {{a few days in}} the absence of oxygen. During this process, polymerisation reaction occurs, increasing the oil’s viscosity. It means that stand or polymerised oil has been boiled to make it unreactive and more viscous. The production of refined <b>linseed</b> oil involves the alkali treatment following the pressing process, improving the colour of this oil (paler and clearer). It is utilised as a medium to increase gloss and transparency of paint colours.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Brazil has 19 million elderly individuals. This {{population}} {{is susceptible to}} disease, and food can contribute to their well-being. The effect of omega 3 on health has been widely studied, although the composition of <b>linseed</b> still requires further investigation. Objective: To verify {{the influence of the}} daily intake of 15 grams of <b>linseed</b> and whether it would change the lipid, inflammatory and nutritional profiles of elderly residents of a long-term institution. Method: A total of 13 elderly women, who ingested <b>linseed</b> for 45 days, were analyzed. Data on food intake was collected through a three-day food record, anthropometric measurements and biochemical tests, before and after the intervention. The <b>linseed</b> used in the experiment was chemically analyzed. Results: The <b>linseed</b> had a positive effect on relieving constipation and increasing albumin; an increase in HDL cholesterol (p = 0. 001) was also observed. Conclusion: <b>Linseed</b> was not effective in relation to improving the lipid profile, but it improved the nutritional and inflammatory profiles of elderly patients...|$|R
