25|$|The {{larval food}} plants in Southern Africa are Sclerocroton integerrimus (Sapium integerrimum) and the jumping-seed tree (Sclerocroton ellipticus). In Kenya, the larva have been {{recorded}} on Excoecaria, Phyllanthus, Macaranga, Kigelia and Sterculia. The larvae are gregarious and at first only eat the upper layer of the leaves, working from the tip to the base, and leaving a pale green dead leaf behind. As they grow older, the larvae begin to eat the entire leaf, starting at the <b>leaf</b> <b>margin.</b> Sometimes the larvae defoliate individual trees.|$|E
25|$|Biannual and {{perennial}} plants produce a stout taproot {{of up to}} 8cm in diameter and 60cm long. Young plants consist of a rosette of leaves, which may be variegated, once-pinnately spiny-lobed, to 30cm long, and having short, fleshy stalks. The stems can be simple or carry many branches, and carry spiny wings along their lengths. The wavy leaves with prominent veins are pinnately divided and are alternately set along the stems. The <b>leaf</b> <b>margin</b> has prominent pale green or yellow veins and large teeth which are topped by fierce spines. The leaf surface may initially be covered in soft, felty hairs, which quickly clear away, most slowly on the veins.|$|E
500|$|The grayish-green {{leaves are}} {{arranged}} in opposite pairs, and attached to the stems by a short petiole. They are generally [...] and , although narrower in some populations. The overall leaf shape is oblate, a rounded shape longer than it is wide, to lanceolate, shaped like {{the head of a}} lance. They are , with a deeply incised <b>leaf</b> <b>margin</b> that may be either wavy or sharp-toothed; even within a single community of P.atriplicifolia, there can be considerable variation in the details of leaf shape. Leaves near the top of branches may merge into bracts. The foliage is aromatic, especially when crushed, with a fragrance described as sage-like, a blend of sage and lavender, or like turpentine.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} often {{confused}} with its close relative, Aloe reynoldsii, {{and they do}} look very similar. However the Coral aloe has smooth <b>leaf</b> <b>margins</b> and red flowers; while Aloe reynoldsii has waxy, toothed <b>leaf</b> <b>margins</b> and yellow flowers.|$|R
50|$|R. Pandanifolia is {{sometimes}} confused with Dracophyllum milliganii. R. Pandanifolia {{can be distinguished}} from this rare species as D.milliganii has terminal inflorescence where as R.

500|$|Telopea oreades grows {{as a large}} shrub or narrow tree [...] {{high with}} a trunk {{reaching}} [...] in diameter. Greyish brown, the trunk is thin {{in relation to the}} tree's height and not buttressed. Its surface is smooth with horizontal lenticels and warty protuberances. Smaller branches are more brown and smooth. Young plants have a much more erect habit than other members of the genus Telopea and their stems have a distinct reddish tinge. The shiny dark green leaves are arranged alternately along the stems. The leaves are narrow- to , and measure [...] long and [...] wide. They have a sunken midrib on the upperside (and corresponding ridge on the underside) with four to six pairs of lateral veins visible at a 45degree angle to the midline.

50|$|The larvae feed on Artemisia scoparia and Artemisia santonicum. They {{mine the}} leaves of their host plant. The mine has {{the form of a}} long, narrow {{corridor}} following the <b>leaf</b> <b>margin.</b> The larvae vacate the mine and create secondary mines, starting at the <b>leaf</b> <b>margin.</b> Young larvae are yellow with a dark brown head. Older larvae are grey-green. The species overwinters as an egg or young larva.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Laurus azorica. They {{mine the}} leaves of their host plant. The mine {{consists}} of a lower- or upper-surface, epidermal corridor that usually begins at the midrib and runs towards the <b>leaf</b> <b>margin.</b> From here, a tentiform mine is made that is partly hidden under the folded <b>leaf</b> <b>margin.</b> Older larvae live freely in a rolled leaf.
