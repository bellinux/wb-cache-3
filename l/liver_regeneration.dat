5|$|Interestingly, a Dutch group {{simultaneously}} {{described an}} identical gene as apolipoprotein {{which it is}} associated with the early phase of <b>liver</b> <b>regeneration,</b> but failed to recognise its important role in the determination of plasma triglyceride levels.|$|E
5|$|APOA5 mainly {{functions}} to influence plasma triglyceride levels. The first suggested mechanism supposes that APOA5 functions as an activator of lipoprotein lipase (which {{is a key}} enzyme in triglyceride catabolism) and, through this process, enhances the metabolism of TG-rich particles. The second is the possible effect of APOA5 on the secretion of VLDL particles, since APOA5 reduces hepatic production by inhibiting VLDL-particle production and assembly by binding to cellular membranes and lipids. Finally, the third possibility relates to the acceleration of the hepatic uptake of lipoprotein remnants {{and it has been}} shown that APOA5 binds to different members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family. In addition to its TG-lowering effect, APOA5 also plays a significant role in modulating HDL maturation and cholesterol metabolism. Increased APOA5 levels were associated with skewed cholesterol distribution from VLDL to large HDL particles. APOA5 mRNA is upregulated during <b>liver</b> <b>regeneration</b> and this suggests that APOA5 serves a function in hepatocyte proliferation. It’s also reported that APOA5 could enhance insulin secretion in beta-cells and the cell surface midkine could be involved in APOA5 endocytosis.|$|E
2500|$|Owing to {{a limited}} {{literature}} on the subject, birds {{are believed to have}} very limited regenerative abilities as adults. Some studies on roosters have suggested that birds can adequately regenerate some parts of the limbs and depending on the conditions in which regeneration takes place, such as age of the animal, the inter-relationship of the injured tissue with other muscles, and the type of operation, can involve complete regeneration of some musculoskeletal structure. Werber and Goldschmidt (1909) found that the goose and duck were capable of regenerating their beaks after partial amputation [...] and Sidorova (1962) observed <b>liver</b> <b>regeneration</b> via hypertrophy in roosters. Birds are also capable of regenerating the hair cells in their cochlea following noise damage or ototoxic drug damage. Despite this evidence, contemporary studies suggest reparative regeneration in avian species is limited to periods during embryonic development. An array of molecular biology techniques have been successful in manipulating cellular pathways known to contribute to spontaneous regeneration in chick embryos. For instance, removing a portion of the elbow joint in a chick embryo via window excision or slice excision and comparing joint tissue specific markers and cartilage markers showed that window excision allowed 10 out of 20 limbs to regenerate and expressed joint genes similarly to a developing embryo. In contrast, slice excision did not allow the joint to regenerate due to the fusion of the skeletal elements seen by an expression of cartilage markers.|$|E
40|$|<b>Liver</b> cell <b>regeneration</b> {{which is}} a {{prominent}} pathological feature in cirrhosis of the liver was examined histopathologically and by figure analysis using immage analyser. Liver cell regenerative changes in liver biopsies of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatitic cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were compared. In PBC, regenerative features of liver cells were mild in degree. In alcoholic cirrhosis, regenerative liver cells were less prominent than in hepatitic cirrhosis. In hepatitic cirrhosis, regenerative liver cell nodules were well developed, showing remarkable pleomorphism of liver cell nuclei and expansive arrangement of liver cell cords. Cellular and structural atypia were observed {{in some parts of}} regenerative nodules. These results suggest that a possibility of occurring HCC is much more prominent in hepatitic cirrhosis than in PBC or alcoholic cirrhosis, because developement of <b>liver</b> cell <b>regeneration</b> is most remarkable in hepatitic cirrhosis...|$|R

30|$|The liver plays several {{important}} roles in the metabolism, including the biosynthesis of plasma proteins, gluconeogenesis and detoxification.

40|$|Background: The {{transcription}} factor NF-kB {{consisting of the}} subunits RelA/p 65 and p 50 {{is known to be}} quickly activated after partial hepatectomy (PH), the functional relevance of which is still a matter of debate. Current concepts suggest that activation of NF-kB is especially critical in non-parenchymal cells to produce cytokines (TNF, IL- 6) to adequately prime hepatocytes to proliferate after PH, while NF-kB within hepatocytes mainly bears cytoprotective functions. Methods: To study the role of the NF-kB pathway in different liver cell compartments, we generated conditional knockout mice in which the transactivating NF-kB subunit RelA/p 65 can be inactivated specifically in hepatocytes (RelaF/FAlbCre) or both in hepatocytes plus non-parenchymal cells including Kupffer cells (RelaF/FMxCre). 2 / 3 and 80 % PH were performed in controls (RelaF/F) and conditional knockout mice (RelaF/FAlbCre and RelaF/FMxCre) and analyzed for regeneration. Results: Hepatocyte-specific deletion of RelA/p 65 in RelaF/FAlbCre mice resulted in an accelerated cell cycle progression without altering <b>liver</b> mass <b>regeneration</b> after 2 / 3 PH. Surprisingly, hepatocyte apoptosis or liver damage were not enhanced in RelaF/FAlbCremice, even when performing 80 % PH. The additional inactivation of RelA/p 65 in non-parenchymal cells in RelaF/FMxCre mice reversed the small proliferative advantage observed after hepatocyte-specific deletion of RelA/p 65 so that RelaF/FMxCre mice displayed normal cell cycle progression, DNA-synthesis and <b>liver</b> mass <b>regeneration.</b> Conclusion: The NF-kB subunit RelA/p 65 fulfills opposite functions in different liver cell compartments in liver regeneratio...|$|R

Accordingly, measures to prevent liver cell necrosis seem at least as important as stimulation of regeneration.
