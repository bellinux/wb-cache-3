For high-volume operations involving the continuous imprinting of items, automatic shuttle and dual platen transfer presses are used. The substrates to be imprinted are continuously loaded onto the <b>lower</b> <b>platen</b> and shuttled under the heat platen, which then applies the necessary heat and pressure.|$|E

A new style of press that is semi-automatic {{has entered the}} market as well, allowing for a manual closing process with an automatic, electromagnetic opening. Digital technology in newer machines enables precise control of heat and pressure levels and timing. The most common types of heat press employ a flat platen to apply heat and pressure to the substrate. In the [...] "clamshell" [...] design, the upper heat element in the press opens like a clamshell, while in the [...] "swing-away" [...] design, the heat platen swings away from the <b>lower</b> <b>platen.</b> Another design type a [...] "draw style press" [...] allows for the bottom platen to be pulled out like a drawer away from the heat for preparation of the graphic. Vacuum presses utilize air pressure to provide the necessary force and can achieve high psi ratings.|$|E

30|$|In the ITSM, a load pulse {{is applied}} to the {{vertical}} diameter of the specimen positioned centrally between the upper and the <b>lower</b> <b>platens,</b> and the resultant peak transient deformation along the horizontal diameter was measured. The method uses cylindrical specimens cored from the field or slabs in the laboratory. In this case, the cores were cut from slab produced in the laboratory. These cores are usually 150 or 100  mm in diameter and has thickness between 30 and 80  mm. Input parameters include target horizontal deformation, load rise time, Poisson’s ratio, test temperature, specimen thickness and diameter. The test was carried out in accordance with DD 213 : 1993 [14]. For this study, the test conditions were as follows: sample diameter: 100  mm; sample thickness: 40  ±  4  mm; Target rise time: 124  ±  4  ms and Mean horizontal deformation: 5  ±  2  μm.|$|R
40|$|The Superpave gyratory {{compactor}} (SGC) is used {{to compact}} asphalt specimens for mixture testing in the Superpave system. Five companies currently manufacture SGCs {{for use in the}} United States, offering a total of eight different models. Each model employs a unique method of setting, inducing, and maintaining the specified angle of gyration. Calibration systems are required for each device for the angle of gyration. All angle measurements are made externally relative to the mold and none of the calibration systems can be universally used on all of the models. The specified external angle of gyration under load (α) is 1. 25 degrees, with a tolerance of ± 0. 02 degrees. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), in partnership with the TestQuip Corporation (New Brighton, MN), developed an angle validation kit (AVK) that measures the dynamic internal angle (DIA) of gyration. The DIA accounts for equipment compliance issues, which are not apparent in measuring the external angle. Bending in the upper and <b>lower</b> mold <b>platens</b> during compact reduces the compactive effort imparted to a specimen. Differences in specimen bulk specific gravities produced by different compactors have bee...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the effects of superimposing ultrasonic vibrations on the <b>lower</b> <b>platen</b> in tension and compression tests of aluminium. By measuring the oscillating force response as well as the static force, it is shown that the experimentally derived stress–strain data from these tests does not satisfy the description of a simple oscillatory stress superposition model. Finite element models of tension and compression tests are created and a description of the contact friction condition is included for the compression test model. By incorporating ultrasonic vibration of the <b>lower</b> <b>platen</b> for an interval during plastic deformation, the finite element model predicts that the stress–strain relationship satisfies a simple oscillatory stress superposition model. The finite element models are then developed further to investigate the predicted stress–strain relationship if a softer material model is incorporated only during the interval of ultrasonic excitation. For the tension test model, this allows the predicted stress–strain data to match the experimentally derived data. For the compression test model, by combining a softer material model description with a change in the coefficient of friction at the contact surface, only during the interval of ultrasonic excitation, the finite element model predicted stress–strain data matched the experimentally derived stress–strain data. The study indicates that it is not sufficient to explain the effects of ultrasonic excitation in metal forming processes only in terms of oscillatory stress superposition and contact friction...|$|E

The temperature of the heat platens was set in one of two ways: either the upper platen was set at 40  °C and the <b>lower</b> <b>platen</b> at 20  °C, which generated a downward heat flow, or the opposite way around, which generated an upward heat flow.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of ultrasonics in metal forming applications {{has been shown}} to reduce the forming load significantly in many research studies. The load reduction has been related to the stress superposition effect, rise in temperature and change in the friction condition between the specimen and die interfaces. This paper reports an investigation into the effects of superimposed ultrasonic oscillation of the die in compression tests on aluminium specimens. In particular, a finite element model is developed to simulate uniaxial compression and to model the effects of a change in the friction boundary condition when ultrasonic excitation is applied to the <b>lower</b> <b>platen.</b> The model predictions of the stress–strain relationship can be compared with test data to provide some insights into the effects of the interfacial condition. The paper shows how the analysis of the test data, combined with finite element models of ultrasonic compression test simulations, allows some initial conclusions to be drawn regarding the influence of the interfacial friction during ultrasonic compression...|$|E
40|$|The plasma etch {{characteristics}} of aluminum nitride (AlN) deposited by low-temperature, 200 C, plasma enhanced {{atomic layer deposition}} (PEALD) was investigated for reactive ion etch (RIE) and inductively coupled plasma-reactive ion etch (ICP-RIE) systems using various mixtures of SF 6 and O 2 under different etch conditions. During RIE, the film exhibits good mask properties with etch rates below 10 r nm/min. For ICP-RIE processes, the film exhibits exceptionally low etch rates in the subnanometer region with <b>lower</b> <b>platen</b> power. The AlN film’s removal occurred through physical mechanisms; consequently, rf power and chamber pressure were the most significant parameters in PEALD AlN film removal because the film was inert to the SFþ x and Oþ chemistries. The etch experiments showed the film to be a resilient masking material. This makes it an attractive candidate for use as an etch mask in demanding SF 6 based plasma etch applications, such as through-wafer etching, or when oxide films are not suitable...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{ultrasonic}} excitation {{of tools}} and dies in metal forming operations {{has been the}} subject of ongoing research for many years. However, the lack of understanding about the effects of ultrasonic vibrations on the forming process has resulted in difficulties in maximising the benefits and applications of this technology. In particular, experimental characterisations of the effects of superimposing ultrasonic oscillations have largely relied on interpretations of measurements of the mean forming load and have ignored the oscillatory forces. Previous research [1] has shown that by applying ultrasonic vibrations to the <b>lower</b> <b>platen</b> in compression tests on pure aluminium specimens, the resulting stress-strain relationship can be characterised by a temporary effective softening of the material during intervals of ultrasonic excitation. The current research investigates this effect in a series of simple forming tests using a number of different metal specimens. In this research, the forming tests are conducted using a piezoelectric force transducer to measure the oscillatory force data during ultrasonic excitation of the die. It is shown that the benefits of superimposing ultrasonic excitation of the die are highly dependent on the material being formed and that, in many cases, the maximum oscillatory force exceeds the static forming load even where the mean forming load is reduced significantly during the interval of ultrasonic excitation...|$|E
40|$|There {{are four}} big medium density {{fibreboard}} (MDF) plants in New Zealand {{with a total}} production capacity of close to one million cubic meters per year. A significant quantity of boards (nearly 3 % or about 30, 000 cubic meters per year) is rejected due to defects such as weak core, low modulus of rupture and elasticity, low internal bonding and delamination. The main cause of these defects, is lack of complete understanding of the inter relationship during the hot-pressing stage between the initial inputs such as temperature, moisture content, platen pressure {{and its impact on}} the properties of boards. The best solution is to develop a mathematical model to assist in understanding these relationships and to solve the equations in the model by using advanced software. This will reduce the number of expensive experiments and will enable us to see some of the parameters, which are otherwise difficult to visualise. Several earlier researchers have tried to model hot pressing of wood composites, mostly either for particle board or oriented strand board (OSB), and only a few are for MDF. The type of numerical methods used to solve the model equations and various assumptions, changes from one investigator to the other. The non-availability of source code to convert the mathematical equations into programme, is one of the reasons for this model development. To improve the productivity of MDF plants in New Zealand, there was a need to develop a computer programme which can include all the latest findings and can remove the defects which are present in earlier models. This model attempts a more complete integration than in the previous models of all the components such as heat transfer, moisture movement and vertical density profile formation in a one-dimensional model of hot pressing of MDF. One of the important features added in the heat and mass transfer part of the model is that the equilibrium moisture content (EMC) equation given for solid wood was modified to be applicable for the MDF fibres. In addition, this EMC equation can cover the complete range of hot pressing temperature from 160 ºC to 200 ºC. The changes in fibre moisture content due to bound water diffusion, which was were earlier neglected, was considered. The resin curing reactions for phenol formaldehyde and urea formaldehyde resins are also incorporated into the model, with the energy and water released during the curing reaction being included in the energy and mass balances. The validation of the heat and mass transfer model was done by comparing the values of core temperature and core pressure from the model and the experiments. The experimental value of core pressure and core temperature is obtained by putting a thermocouple and pressure transducer in the middle of the mat. The experimental core temperature results show qualitative agreement with the predicted results. In the beginning, the core temperatures from both experiment and model overlap each other. In the middle of the press cycle, the experimental core temperature is higher by 10 ºC and by the end the difference decreases to 5 ºC. The vertical density profile (VDP) is a critical determining factor for the strength and quality of MDF panels. The earlier concept of ratio of modulus of elasticity of the layer to the sum of modulus of elasticity of all the layers in the previous time step, given by Suo and Bowyer (1994), is refined with the latest published findings. The equation given by Carvalho et al. (2001) is used to calculate the MOE of different layers of the mat. The differential equation of a Maxwell element given by Zombori (2001) is used to measure stress, nonlinear strain function and relaxation of fibres. The model gives good agreement of peak and core density at <b>lower</b> <b>platen</b> temperature at 160 ºC but with the increase of platen temperature to 198 ºC, the rise in peak density is comparatively higher. There is a distinct increase in predicted peak density by 150 kg/m³ in comparison to the experimental result, where the increase is only by 10 kg/m³. There is a large decline (50 kg/m³) in core density in the experimental results in comparison to only a slight decline (13 kg/m³) in the predicted results. The use of Matlab provides a very convenient platform for producing graphical results. The time of computation at present is nearly 20 hrs in a personal computer with Pentium four processor and one GB RAM. The model can predict properties of a pressed board for the standard manufacturing conditions and also the new hot pressing technologies such as the use of steam injection or a cooling zone in the continuous press. A comparative study has been done to show the advantages of using new hot pressing technology. The present model will become an important tool in the hands of wood technologist, process engineers and MDF manufacturing personnel, to better understand the internal processes and to improve production and quality of MDF boards. This theoretical model helped in developing better understanding of internal processes. By using it, we can analyse the impact of platen temperature, moisture content on the core temperature, core pressure and density profile. It gives better insight into the relationship between core pressure and delamination of the board. The model is also able to predict the internal changes in the new hot pressing technologies such as the steam injection pressing and the use of a cooling zone in a continuous press. Using the simulation results, the exact time needed for the complete curing of resin can be calculated and then these results can be applied in the commercial plants. If the pressing time is reduced, then the over all production of both batch press and continuous press will increase. The second part of the project is the development of an empirical model to correlate the physical properties from the MDF board to the mean density. The empirical model is simple and straightforward, and thus can be applied in commercial operation for control and optimization. The empirical model can predict peak density, core density, and modulus of rupture, elasticity and internal bonding within the limits in which those relationships are derived. The model gives good results for thickness ranging from 10 to 13. 5 mm and density ranging from 485 kg/m³ to 718 kg/m³...|$|E
