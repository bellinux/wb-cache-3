50|$|The {{morning glory}} Calystegia silvatica (syn. Calystegia sepium silvatica, C. inflata, and C. sylvestris) is {{known by the}} common name giant {{bindweed}} or <b>large</b> <b>bindweed.</b> It is the largest species of bindweed and is a strong rampant climber.|$|E
50|$|Spanning 1.2 {{hectares}} (approx 3 acres), {{the limestone}} grassland {{of the reserve}} provides a rich array of wildflowers, such as common bird's-foot-trefoil, horseshoe vetch, kidney vetch, ivy broomrape, Alexanders, <b>large</b> <b>bindweed,</b> white bryony, wild madder and charlock. These flowers make suitable conditions for butterflies and other insects such as the grey bush cricket. The sheltering copse of sycamores, {{as well as the}} scrub-covered slopes down to Portland's disused railway track, are both important features for migrating birds arriving or leaving via Portland, while the sheltered tall grass {{has become one of the}} best sites on island for glow-worms. A conservation team operates on the site, and stops the scrub from encroaching onto the grassland, particularly non-native plants like Cotoneaster horizontalis, as well as dealing with tree regeneration.|$|E
50|$|Main larval host {{plants are}} in the family Convolvulaceae, {{especially}} field bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis) and <b>larger</b> <b>bindweed</b> (Calystegia sepium), but these polyphagous larvae feed also on common yarrow (Achillea millefolium). Adults occur from April to September.|$|R
