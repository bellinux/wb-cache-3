5|$|In January 1956 Hope {{recorded}} with another rising star, Jackie McLean, for the saxophonist's <b>Lights</b> <b>Out!</b> In April {{of the same}} year Hope should have appeared on saxophonist Gene Ammons' The Happy Blues, but he left the record company's building before the session began and did not return. Hope claimed that he had gone to visit an aunt in hospital, but his absence was attributed by others to his heroin addiction. This had existed on and off for several years, and had led to at least one spell in prison. His drug problem and associated criminal record led to the withdrawal of Hope's New York City Cabaret Card around 1956, so he was no longer permitted to play in clubs in the city.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two sets}} of {{lighting}} in the top spires and decoration. The first are the V-shaped lighting inserts in the steel of the building itself. Added later were groups of floodlights that are on mast arms directed back at the building. This allows {{the top of the}} building to be lit in many colors for special occasions. The tube lighting atop the building was added in 1981, although it {{had been part of the}} original design. Until 1998 the lights were turned off at 2a.m., but New York Observer columnist Ron Rosenbaum convinced Tishman Speyer to keep the lights on until 6a.m. Since 2015, the Chrysler Building and other city skyscrapers have been part of the Audubon Society's <b>Lights</b> <b>Out</b> program, wherein the building turns off its lights during bird migration seasons.|$|E

25|$|<b>Lights</b> <b>Out</b> {{received}} mixed reviews, with critics praising Jonathan Boakes' {{individual work}} on the game and his obvious passion for the adventure genre. Some also praised the atmosphere and storyline. Common criticisms focused on the game's technical limitations, specifically its graphical presentation, and predictable gameplay. Most critics also felt the game failed to improve on the original Dark Fall.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lights</b> <b>Out</b> is a first-person {{psychological}} horror/adventure game, {{which employs}} {{a very simple}} HUD.

25|$|Ralph Zia, {{commanding}} officer of the Hawkeye monitored the airways designated for commercial jets focusing on a converge point south of Crete. He and his crew tracked radar contacts flying west out of Egypt, presumably towards Tunisia. Zia had to send a Tomcat to visually determine if the contact was an EgyptAir 737, as there was no sensor that would confirm the exact identity of each radar blip. The fighter jets were commanded to perform the operation with <b>lights</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{gameplay}} {{is based}} around solving puzzles. However, unlike most modern adventure games, <b>Lights</b> <b>Out</b> does not keep note of any information or clues {{acquired by the}} player (for example, notes found by the player are not entered into the inventory, and journal entries read by the player are not recorded in any way). This forces the player {{to keep track of}} every clue and detail themselves. If the player wishes to recheck a journal entry, they must find the journal and re-read it.|$|E

Crispa would win one more MICAA crown in 1974, a year before the PBA was born. Among his teammates then were Alberto Guidaben, Atoy Co, Edgardo Carvajal, and Rodolfo Soriano.|$|E
25|$|Gardiner {{maintains}} that on 14 April, First Officer Murdoch (who was not officially on duty yet) {{was on the}} bridge because {{he was one of}} the few high-ranking officers other than Captain Smith who knew of the plan and was keeping a watch out for the rescue ships. One of Gardiner's most controversial statements is that the Titanic did not strike an iceberg, but an IMM rescue ship that was drifting on station with its <b>lights</b> <b>out.</b> Gardiner based this hypothesis on the idea that the supposed iceberg was seen at such a short distance by the lookouts on the Titanic because it was actually a darkened ship, and he also does not believe an iceberg could inflict such sustained and serious damage to a steel double-hulled vessel such as the Titanic.|$|E
25|$|Bourque, Cam Neely and Keith Crowder led the Bruins {{to another}} Cup Final {{appearance}} in 1988 against the Edmonton Oilers. The Bruins {{lost in a}} four-game sweep, but a memorable moment in the would-be fourth game ensued, when {{in the second period}} with the game tied 3–3, a blown fuse put the <b>lights</b> <b>out</b> at the Boston Garden. The rest of the game was cancelled and the series shifted to Edmonton. The Oilers completed the sweep, 6–3, back at Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton in what was originally scheduled as Game Five. The event is considered to be the reason the Bruins began work on a new arena. Boston returned to the Stanley Cup Final in 1990 (with Neely, Bourque, Craig Janney, Bobby Carpenter, and rookie Don Sweeney, and former Oiler goalie Andy Moog and Reggie Lemelin splitting goaltending duties), but again lost to the Oilers, this time in five games.|$|E

In August, the then reigning Chaotic Wrestling {{champion}} {{was interviewed by}} Boston Magazine in which he discussed the difficulties of being an independent wrestler. His second reign lasted for {{a little over two}} months before he was dethroned by The One Night Stand's Ronnie D. Lishus in Lawrence, Massachusetts on September 7, 2001; he had defeated Aaron Stevens in a match lasting 47 seconds earlier that same night. Two weeks later, Ferraro defeated Jimmy Cash in a Tables match. His last match was against Scarecrow on December 14, 2001, which ended in a disqualification. Suffering a serious neck injury in his bout with Ronnie D. Lishus, he took three months off to recuperate and lost 30 pounds by the time he returned to action early the next year.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the murder}} of Burbank police officer Matthew Pavelka in 2003, the city {{experienced}} earlier cases of tragedy involving local law enforcement. Marshal Luther Colson and Deputy City Marshal Robert L. Normand were shot to death while patrolling the city. Their deaths in 1914 and 1920 marked the first time that Burbank police officers were killed in the line of duty. Colson was shot the evening of November 16, 1914, when he was walking on railroad tracks near what is now Victory Place and Lake Street. Six years later, Normand was killed when he responded to a call for help to check on three men in a vehicle with its <b>lights</b> <b>out.</b> The men began shooting as Normand and another officer approached the car. The other officer survived despite three bullet wounds, but Normand died at the scene. Additionally, two other Burbank officers have died on duty. They were motorcycle officers Joseph R. Wilson and Richard E. Kunkle, who were killed in separate accidents in 1961.|$|E
25|$|Airborne Interception radar (AI) was unreliable. The heavy {{fighting}} in the Battle of Britain had eaten up most of Fighter Command's resources, so there was little investment in night fighting. Bombers were flown with airborne search <b>lights</b> <b>out</b> of desperation but to little avail. Of greater potential was the GL (Gunlaying) radar and searchlights with fighter direction from RAF fighter control rooms to begin a GCI system (Ground Control-led Interception) under Group-level control (No. 10 Group RAF, No. 11 Group RAF and No. 12 Group RAF). Whitehall's disquiet at {{the failures of the}} RAF led to the replacement of Dowding (who was already due for retirement) with Sholto Douglas on 25 November. Douglas set about introducing more squadrons and dispersing the few GL sets to create a carpet effect in the southern counties. Still, in February 1941, there remained only seven squadrons with 87 pilots, under half the required strength. The GL carpet was supported by six GCI sets controlling radar-equipped night-fighters. By the height of the Blitz, they were becoming more successful. The number of contacts and combats rose in 1941, from 44 and two in 48 sorties in January 1941, to 204 and 74 in May (643 sorties). But even in May, 67% of the sorties were visual cat's-eye missions. Curiously, while 43% of the contacts in May 1941 were by visual sightings, they accounted for 61 percent of the combats. Yet when compared with Luftwaffe daylight operations, there was a sharp decline in German losses to 1 percent. If a vigilant bomber crew could spot the fighter first, they had a decent chance at evading it.|$|E
