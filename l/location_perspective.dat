40|$|International audienceReference frames in {{spatial memory}} {{encoding}} {{have been examined}} intensively in recent years. However, their importance for recall has received considerably less attention. In the present study, passersby used tags to arrange a configuration map of prominent city center landmarks. It {{has been shown that}} such configurational knowledge is memorized within a north-up reference frame. However, participants adjusted their maps according to their body orientations. For example, when participants faced south, the maps were likely to face south-up. Participants also constructed maps along their location perspective-that is, the self-target direction. If, for instance, they were east of the represented area, their maps were oriented west-up. If the <b>location</b> <b>perspective</b> and body orientation were in opposite directions (i. e., if participants faced away from the city center), participants relied on <b>location</b> <b>perspective.</b> The results indicate that reference frames in spatial recall depend on the current situation rather than on the organization in long-term memory. These results cannot be explained by activation spread within a view graph, which had been used to explain similar results in the recall of city plazas. However, the results are consistent with forming and transforming a spatial image of nonvisible city locations from the current location. Furthermore, prior research has almost exclusively focused on body- and environment-based reference frames. The strong influence of <b>location</b> <b>perspective</b> in an everyday navigational context indicates that such a reference frame should be considered more often when examining human spatial cognition...|$|E

40|$|Geographical {{characteristics}} {{derived from}} the historical check-in data have been reported effective in improving location recommendation accuracy. However, previous studies mainly exploit geographical characteristics from a user’s perspective, via modeling the geographical distribution of each individual user’s check-ins. In this paper, {{we are interested in}} exploiting geographical characteristics from a <b>location</b> <b>perspective,</b> by modeling the geographical neighborhood of a location. The neighborhood is modeled at two levels: the instance-level neighborhood defined by a few nearest neighbors of the location, and the region-level neighborhood for the geographical region where the location exists. We propose a novel recommendation approach, namely Instance-Region Neighborhood Matrix Factorization (IRenMF), which exploits two levels of geographical neighborhood characteristics: a) instance-level characteristics, i. e., nearest neighboring locations tend to share more similar user preferences; and b) region-level characteristics, i. e., locations in the same geographical region may share similar user preferences. In IRenMF, the two levels of geographical characteristics are naturally incorporated into the learning of latent features of users and locations, so that IRenMF predicts users’ preferences on locations more accurately. Extensive experiments on the real data collected from Gowalla, a popular LBSN, demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our approach...|$|E

40|$|Abstract ⎯ Nowadays, Web-based environments offer a {{tremendous}} opportunity to add flexibility in traditional engineering curricula by providing students with versatile {{access to the}} learning resources from both a time and a <b>location</b> <b>perspective.</b> In this context, we have developed the eMersion environment with the aim to provide a Web-based learning environment that supports hands-on experimentation through remote manipulation of physical laboratory devices and/or computer simulation tools. The eMersion environment provides the students with the possibilities {{to carry out the}} experimentation in a flexible way and is currently used in various courses offered by the School of Engineering at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL). This paper presents a proposed model for the assessment of Web-based learning environment in engineering education. The model encourages performing evaluation under an iterative perspective. The assessment processes are carried out at different phases at a learning process through different assessment loops. This assessment model allows the integration of different analysis methods including quantitative, qualitative and social network analysis. The paper also describes the results and analyses of the evaluation process carried out in the Automatic Control laboratory courses using the Cockpit environment from the 2002 winter to the 2004 summer semesters at the EPFL. The evaluation takes place in an iterative process with the purpose of studying different aspects of a Webbased engineering learning community, such as participation, flexibility and collaboration. Another objective is to improve the user interface design. These evaluation results allow the observation of different dimensions of the Web-based learning process in engineering education.

With di↵erent names and functions, relays {{play a crucial}} role in the design of telecommunications and transportation networks and finding optimal relay locations is an important concern in various applications. We investigate several relay location problems from the literature, propose new ones and design efficient solution methods to obtain managerial insights. The basic problem we investigate in this dissertation is the Regenerator Location Problem (RLP). We revisit RLP from the hub <b>location</b> <b>perspective</b> and introduce two new dimensions involving the challenges of survivability. Considering the flexible optical network architecture, we relax all pairs connectivity, infinite capacity links and single modulation level assumptions of RLP and introduce the regenerator location problem in flexible optical networks (RLP-FON). RLP-FON solves regenerator location, routing, bandwidth allocation and modulation selection problems jointly to better exploit the opportunities o↵ered by this novel network architecture. For various problems arising in telecommunications and transportation it is beneficial to consider edge design and relay locations together. We add the edge design aspect to RLP and extend our research to Network Design Problem with Relays. Di↵erent than telecommunications networks, the total length of a route is an important issue in transportation. So in the final part we include circuitry constraints to the routing decisions and study the Refueling Station Location Problem for Alternative Fuel Vehicles. We approach relay location problems from di↵erent angles: network topologies, capacities, costs, and demands and provide significant theoretical results. For all relay location problems, the reach limitations for the related entities pose the main challenge and we propose novel path-segment based formulation approaches to incorporate these constraints in an efficient way. Extensive numerical experiments with realistic problem instances attest to the efficacy of the proposed approach. by Barış Yıldız. Ph. D...|$|E
40|$|With the {{currently}} available positioning {{devices such as}} Global Positioning System (GPS), RFID, Bluetooth and WI-FI, the locations of moving objects constitute an important foundation {{for a variety of}} applications. However, with the recent developments new challenges are presented to traditional database technology. In traditional database systems, the data structures do not support the high-update objects since these structures have not been designed to accommodate dynamic updates of moving objects. Therefore, much research has gone into the outdoor moving objects (e. g. indexing and querying). However, moving objects in indoor spaces no less important than in outdoor. Indoor space refers to cellular spaces where objects are located based on their cells/rooms. Similarly, in some outdoor topographical spaces, moving objects applications focus only on the region/ cell where mobile/moving objects are located (not the exact coordinate location). Therefore, this thesis addresses three important basic issues in moving objects databases: (i) understating the variety of the moving objects' features and queries, (ii) adjacency/cellular indexing for moving objects in indoor space, and (iii) adjacency indexing for moving objects in outdoor space. This thesis starts by presenting a new taxonomy for moving object queries. This taxonomy provides {{a better understanding of the}} moving objects' features and their variety of queries. The taxonomy for moving object queries is based on five perspectives. First is the <b>Location</b> <b>perspective,</b> which includes common spatial queries such as K nearest neighbours (KNN), range queries and others. Second is the Motion perspective, which covers direction, velocity, distance and displacement queries. Third is the Object perspective, which includes the type status queries and the form status queries. Fourth is the Temporal perspective which includes many queries such as the trajectory, timestamped, and period queries. Last is the Patterns perspective, which includes many patterns such as spatial movement patterns and temporal movement patterns. Each perspective is explained with illustrated examples. In addition, in indoor spaces, we propose a new cells adjacency-based index structure for moving objects. The new index structure focuses on the moving objects based on the notion of cellular space. Therefore, an indoor filling space algorithm is proposed to represent overlapping between the cells. Then, the index structure for indoor space uses the indoor filling space algorithm for efficient adjacency grouping and serving the indoor spatial queries. The temporal side has been presented using three different techniques: Trajectories Indoor-tree (TI-tree), Moving Objects Timestamping-tree in indoor cellular space (MOT-tree) and Indoor Trajectories Deltas index based on the connectivity of cellular space (ITD-tree). Moreover, in order to improve the performance of the index structure in indoor space, the density of the moving objects needs to be considered. Thus, this thesis presents a new index for moving objects (Indoor(d) -tree) that distinguishes between the high and low density cells. Moreover, it presents a new index structure for moving objects in multi-floor indoor environments (Graph-based Multidimensional Indoor-Tree or GMI-tree) which uses the indoor connectivity graph to group the moving objects multidimensionally and to support wings/sections positioning queries. Moreover, in outdoor spaces, we extended the regional/adjacency indexing in indoor spaces to be applicable in topographical outdoor spaces. Thus, we propose an efficient data structure index (Topographical Outdoor-tree or TO-tree) for the moving objects based on their cellular location. The proposed Adjacent Level Algorithm and Connection Cells Algorithm are used to determine the connectivity level of each cell in the topographical outdoor space. Therefore, the TO-tree will group the moving objects based on their adjacency, thereby reducing the update costs and efficiently supporting the spatial queries and adjacency queries. Furthermore, based on our taxonomy, a very limited number of data structures concentrates on the motion vectors in the construction of the moving objects' data. Therefore, we propose a new index structure (DV-TPR*-tree) that supports velocity and direction queries, beside the common spatial queries. To sum up, this thesis introduces a new level of indexing called adjacency indexing which proves to be efficient and robust in indoor and outdoor spaces...|$|E

40|$|Although {{organizational}} births now attract considerable scholarly attention, {{virtually no}} {{effort has been}} made to distinguish conceptually among different kinds of births and to explore the theoretical and empirical implications of these distinctions. I develop two general perspectives in order to examine the causes of two key types of birth — organizational start-ups and entries — in the nineteenth-century life insurance industry of New York. Though the strategic niche perspective is strongly supported by the start-ups model, the market location framework is well supported by the entries equation. Hence, I show that the determinants of these forms of birth vary systematically, indicating that start-ups and entries (and other birth types) must be distinguished in future research. More generally, I discuss the potential for drawing on the core assumptions of the strategic niche and market <b>location</b> <b>perspectives</b> in order to develop a unified theory of organizational birth types. New organizations recently have been championed as seedbeds of technological innovation, creators of significant employment opportunities and economic growth, and the root cause of organizational diversity in modern societies.

In this study, I significantly advance existing research on this phenomenon. Virtually no effort {{has been made to}} distinguish conceptually among different kinds of births, to theorize about their causes, and to assess empirically the predictions. However, new organizational launchings in existing markets and entries of existing entities into new markets are recognized as key birth types, largely due to their effects on industrial and economic conditions but also because controversy often has surrounded the relationship between organizational launchings and entrie...|$|R
