40|$|The {{yield of}} {{monoclonal}} antibody (Mab) production processes depends on media formulation, inocula quality, and process conditions. As in industrial processes tight cultivation conditions are used, and inocula quality and viable cell densities are controlled to reasonable levels, media formulation {{and raw materials}} <b>lot-to-lot</b> variability in quality will have, in those circumstances, the highest impact on process performance. In the particular Mab process studied, two different raw materials were used: a complex carbon and nitrogen source made of specific peptones and defined chemical media containing multiple components. Using different spectroscopy techniques {{for each of the}} raw material types, it was concluded that for the complex peptone-based ingredient, near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy was more capable of capturing <b>lot-to-lot</b> variability. For the chemically defined media containing fluorophores, two-dimensional (2 D) -fluorescence spectroscopy was more capable of capturing <b>lot-to-lot</b> variability. Because in Mab cultivation processes both types of raw materials are used, combining the NIR and 2 D-fluorescence spectra for each of the media components enabled predictive models for yield to be developed that out-performed any other model involving either one raw material alone, or only one type of spectroscopic tool for both raw materials. For each particular raw material, the capability of each spectroscopy to detect <b>lot-to-lot</b> differences was demonstrated after spectra preprocessing and specific wavelength regions selection.

The differences in the mean control values, the percent difference (% difference), and the differ-ence to between-run standard deviation ratio (D:SD ratio) between successive lots were calculated. The % difference in mean control values between 2 reagent lots ranged from 0. 1 to 17. 5 % for AFP, 1. 0 to 18. 6 % for ferritin, 0. 6 to 14. 3 % for CA 19 - 9, 0. 6 to 16. 2 % for HBsAg, and 0. 1 to 17. 7 % for anti-HBs except negative controls of HBsAg and anti-HBs.

In addition, the <b>lot-to-lot</b> variability in a novel excipient, LubriTose SD, composed of spray-dried lactose monohydrate co-processed with distilled glyceryl monostearate, was also assessed. Several particle, powder, and compact level properties were measured on samples obtained from two to three lot numbers for each product. The particle level properties measured are particle size distribution and apparent density. The powder level properties include the poured and tapped bulk density, as well as shear cell parameters, such as the effective {{angle of internal friction}} and the powder flow function. The compact level properties measured include the elastic modulus, tensile strength, and critical stress intensity factor. ^ The overall <b>lot-to-lot</b> variability was small for Pharmatose and Foremost products, with the exception of Foremost 310, which demonstrated significant <b>lot-to-lot</b> variability in the powder flow function obtained from shear cell measurements.

Methods: The reference hexokinase method was compared to different POCT systems based on glucose oxidase (blood gas instruments) or glucose dehydrogenase (handheld glucometers). Based upon daily internal quality control data, total errors were calculated for the various glucose methods and the analytical variability of the glucometers was estimated. Results: The total error of the glucometers exceeded by far the desirable analytical specifications (based on a biological variability model). <b>Lot-to-lot</b> variation, inter-instrument variation and inter-operator variability contributed approximately equally to total variance. As in a hospital environment, distribution of hematocrit values is broad, converting blood glucose into plasma values using a fixed factor further increases variance.
