40|$|Abstract: A {{chain tension}} member is of {{essential}} {{importance for the}} process of transportation of run-of-mine material on a coal face. Poland belongs to leading manufactures of mining <b>link</b> <b>chains</b> characterized by increased mechanical properties. High quality of increased properties of chains {{is the result of}} the application of newest generation of equipment in manufacturing processes, the choice of the highest quality of steel and first of all special heat treatment which secures links for diversified mechanical properties along its circuit. Round and flat <b>link</b> <b>chains</b> are used in longwall mining. Their mechanical and geometrical properties as well as fields of their application are presented in the paper. The computer method of selection of mining chains for AFC is also described in the paper. Conclusions make the final part of the paper.

40|$|International audienceProtein {{ubiquitylation}} {{is essential}} for many events linked to intracellular protein trafficking. Despite {{the significance of this}} process, the molecular mechanisms that govern the regulation of ubiquitylation remain largely unknown. Plasma membrane transporters are subjected to tightly regulated endocytosis, and ubiquitylation is a key signal at several stages of the endocytic pathway. The yeast monocarboxylate transporter Jen 1 displays glucose-regulated endocytosis. We show here that Casein Kinase 1 -dependent phosphorylation, and HECT-ubiquitin ligase Rsp 5 -dependent ubiquitylation are required for Jen 1 endocytosis. Ubiquitylation and endocytosis of Jen 1 are induced within minutes in response to glucose addition. Jen 1 is modified at the cell surface by oligo-ubiquitylation with ubiquitin-K 63 <b>linked</b> <b>chain(s),</b> and Jen 1 -Lys 338 is one of the target residues. Ubiquitin-K 63 <b>linked</b> <b>chain(s)</b> are also required directly or indirectly to sort Jen 1 into multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Jen 1 {{is one of the few}} examples for which ubiquitin-K 63 <b>linked</b> <b>chain(s)</b> were shown to be required for correct trafficking at two stages of endocytosis: endocytic internalization and sorting at MVBs...|$|R
