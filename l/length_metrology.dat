40|$|ABSTRACT: The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission SRTM {{produced}} the first global {{digital elevation model}} (DEM) data set of the world’s topography in the year 2000. The data set covers regions between ± 60 degrees latitude with a resolution of 30 meters. The 90 % height accuracy in these regions is on the range of 6 meters, limited by the baseline <b>length,</b> the <b>metrology</b> and the instrument noise. In mountainous areas larger data gaps exist in the C-band data set produced by NASA/JPL {{as well as in}} the X-band data set produced at DLR. The reason for these gaps are high slopes that lead to radar shadow, layover and to phase unwrapping problems. In order to overcome these problems and to further increase the DEM accuracy, future systems must take advantage of multiple incidence angles, multiple heading angles and multiple baselines or multiple radar frequencies. The paper demonstrates high mountain artifacts in SRTM data and demonstrates strategies and algorithms to overcome them. Optimized acquisition strategies for future missions are proposed that are adapted to the slope distribution of the area. The TanDEM-X mission currently studied at DLR and the expected product accuracy is shortly presented. ...|$|R

The Space Interferometry Mission (SIM) and Deep Space 3 (DS- 3) are two missions currently funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that are space-based optical interferometers. In order to properly recombine the starlight received at each telescope of the interferometer {{it is necessary to}} perform high resolution laser metrology to stabilize the interferometer. A potentially significant error source in performing high resolution <b>metrology</b> <b>length</b> measurements is the potential for fluctuations in the laser gauge itself. If the laser frequency or wavelength is changing over time it will be misinterpreted as a length change in one of the legs of the interferometer. An analysis of the frequency stability requirement for SIM resulted in a fractional frequency stability requirement of square root (S(sub y) (f)) = < 2 x 10 (exp - 12) /square root(Hz) at Fourier frequencies between 10 Hz and 1000 Hz. The DS- 3 mission stability requirement is further increased to square root (S(sub y) (f)) = < 5 x 10 (exp - 14) /Square root(Hz) at Fourier frequencies between 0. 2 Hz and 10 kHz with a goal of extending the low frequency range to 0. 05 Hz. The free running performance of the Lightwave Electronics NPRO lasers, which are the baseline laser for both SIM and DS- 3 vary in stability and we have measured them to perform as follows (9 x l 0 (exp - 11) / f(Hz)) (Hz) /square root(Hz)) = <(square root (S(sub y) (f)) = <(1. 3 x l 0 (exp - 8) / f(Hz)) /Square root(Hz).

40|$|Abstract − Coherent {{absolute}} distance interferometry {{is one of}} {{the most}} interesting techniques for <b>length</b> <b>metrology.</b> In frequency sweeping interferometry (FSI), measurements are made without ambiguity, by using a synthetic wavelengths resulting from a frequency sweep. Accuracy is mainly dependent on the capability to measure the synthetic wavelength, using a Fabry-Perot interferometer (FP) to count resonances as frequency sweeps, and therefore the number of detected synthetic fringes. For large ranges, the number of fringes dominates performance, leading to a linear decrease of the accuracy with range. By increasing the size of the interferometer reference arm, and measuring both the distance and the reference arm independently, it is possible to maintain small distance high accuracy measurements, even for much larger range. In the context of the ESA-PROBA 3 mission (coronagraph and demonstration of metrology for freeflying formation), we implemented a FSI sensor composed of a mode-hop free frequency sweep external cavity diode laser, a high finesse FP (to measure accurately the frequency sweep range) and a dual measurement system to enable the measurements at 150 m with an accuracy at the tens of micrometer level.

Laser displacement interferometers (LDI) and precise clocks are used in such measurements. To obtain a relative uncertainty of a few parts in 109 (or a few units of 10 - 8 ms- 2) in a g-measurement on the Earth the uncertainty in the length measurement (for the path length {{in the range from}} 0. 025 m to about 0. 5 m for different types of gravimeters) should be less than 0. 025 nm and 0. 5 nm, respectively. In addition, the rate of interference fringe counting achieves more than 6 MHz. A high accuracy in the measurements length and time is crucial for the ABG but a direct calibration of its LDI in terms of the length unit is not possible due to the design of the absolute gravimeter and because the required uncertainty in the calibration is difficult to reach.

40|$|A passive optical {{resonator}} is {{a special}} sensor used for measurement of lengths on the nanometer and sub-nanometer scale. A stabilized optical frequency comb can provide an ultimate reference for measuring the wavelength of a tunable laser locked to the optical resonator. If we lock the repetition and offset frequencies of the comb to a high-grade radiofrequency (RF) oscillator its relative frequency stability is transferred from the RF to the optical frequency domain. Experiments {{in the field of}} precise <b>length</b> <b>metrology</b> of low-expansion materials are usually of long-term nature so it is required that the optical frequency comb stay in operation {{for an extended period of}} time. The optoelectronic closed-loop systems used for stabilization of combs are usually based on traditional analog electronic circuits processing signals from photodetectors.

40|$|Large-frame ring laser {{gyroscopes}} {{are extremely}} sensitive inertial detectors of rotational motion. When properly coupled to the ground, they provide precise {{measurements of the}} Earth rotation rate and give important informations to geodesy and geophysics. Recent advances in this technology led to consider the application of ring laser gyroscopes to fundamental physics. In this context is GINGER (Gyroscopes IN GEneral Relativity), a scientic proposal for testing General Relativity (local observation of the Lense-Thirring eect) with a ground-based array of ring laser gyroscopes. The experimental target is to locally measure the Earth rotation rate with a relative precision better than one part in 109, corresponding to an absolute rotational resolution of 10 − 14 rad/s. The main factor limiting the performances of the presently most stable ring laser gyroscopes is the uncontrolled deformation of their optical cavity, since instabilities in the cavity geometry introduce systematic errors in the rotational signal. Cavity geometry is typically kept stable by using monolithic frames made of ultra-low thermal expansion materials, and operating in very well isolated environments. An alternative approach {{is based on the}} active control of the shape in heterolithic cavities, by measuring and stabilizing the mirrors positions by means of laser-based <b>length</b> <b>metrology.</b> The goal of this thesis is the development of a stabilization system based on interferometric <b>length</b> <b>metrology,</b> with a view to improve the sensitivity of the new generation square ring laser gyroscopes, going beyond the level achievable with passive methods. The main idea proposed in this work is to exploit the diagonal resonators formed by opposite cavity mirrors, and to use their lengths as observables to constraint, against an optical reference standard, residual deformation degrees of freedom of the square cavity. As a rst step, a detailed model of the light propagation along the square cavity has been developed. This allowed us to quantify the eectiveness of the v xed length constraint of the diagonal resonators, and gave precise indications for the optimization strategy of the residual degrees of freedom. The optical frequency reference is a helium neon laser stabilized to the iodine molecular absorption. Since the power emitted by this laser is of only 300 µW, an optical amplier, based on the injection locking of a 15 mW diode laser, has been developed to guarantee a proper signal to noise ratio in the interferometric absolute length measurements. To stabilize the absolute lengths of the two diagonals, we proposed an original experimental method for the determination of both the optical resonance frequency and the free spectral range of each cavity. It is based on a triple-frequency modulation of the interrogating laser beam by electro-optic modulators. In a rst tabletop experiment, the method has been veried on two Fabry-Perot resonators that, composed by couples of spherical mirrors typically used in the He-Ne ring cavities, simulate the diagonals of a ring laser gyroscope on an optical bench. Here, the capability of setting equal the two lengths at the level of 500 nm, with residual uctuations only limited by the laser frequency noise, has been experimentally proved. As a nal result, we have applied the developed method to lock the diagonal cavities lengths of GP 2 ring laser gyroscope, a square cavity 1. 6 m in side length dedicated to the interferometric control of the cavity geometry deformations, and fully set up at the INFN laboratories in Pisa in June 201...|$|E

Advances in precision measurement have consistently led to important scientific discoveries. At the fundamental level, measurement precision {{is limited by the}} number N of quantum resources (such as photons) that are used. Standard measurement schemes, using each resource independently, lead to a phase uncertainty that scales as 1 /√N—known as the standard quantum limit. However, it has long been conjectured that {{it should be possible to}} achieve a precision limited only by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, dramatically improving the scaling to 1 /N (ref. 3). It is commonly thought that achieving this improvement requires the use of exotic quantum entangled states, such as the NOON state. These states are extremely difficult to generate. Measurement schemes with counted photons or ions have been performed with N≤ 6 (refs 6 – 15), but few have surpassed the standard quantum limit 1 and none have shown Heisenberg-limited scaling. Here we demonstrate experimentally a Heisenberg-limited phase estimation procedure. We replace entangled input states with multiple applications of the phase shift on unentangled single-photon states. We generalize Kitaev’s phase estimation algorithm using adaptive measurement theory to achieve a standard deviation scaling at the Heisenberg limit. For the largest number of resources used (N= 378), we estimate an unknown phase with a variance more than 10 dB below the standard quantum limit; achieving this variance would require more than 4, 000 resources using standard interferometry. Our results represent a drastic reduction in the complexity of achieving quantum-enhanced measurement precision. 5 page(s...|$|E

In the first paper the fundamentals of FS-lasers and frequency combs are explained as well as the major study results of the first team. In the second paper (this paper) the results of the second study team are presented and a more elaborate section on the application of FSL-systems in space is included. <b>Length</b> <b>metrology</b> systems based of FS-Lasers offer an unrivalled dynamic range and yields absolute distance measurements. At this stage its dynamic range is limited by the external references (like atomic clocks or Ultra Stable Oscillators) used to stabilize the systems. Publications prove that an accuracy of the absolute distance measurement of few micrometers, is feasible over a working range as large as 240 m. [1] Substantially larger working ranges are feasible as well as accuracies of tens of nanometers. [2] The TNO study team distinguishes two groups of measurements systems, the Electrical Heterodyning (EH) and the Optical Heterodyning (OH). Both types are analyzed in depth in this paper and the studied FSL-systems are linked to potential missions. This paper includes systems with accuracy in the micrometers as well as tens of nanometers. Special attention is given to the implementation, since a large gain can be obtain by combining with other metrology functions and by careful source and element selection. Proposed systems are benchmarked against normal ranging systems, such as laser rangers, absolute and relative interferometers in terms of accuracy, range, power consumption, mass and volume, non-FSL systems problems and perspectives. Since the FSL-systems use materials not yet used in space, the qualification of these materials is treated. In a similar way the potential perturbations are analyzed, to ascertain their influence on the systems performance. The last part of the paper deals with the outlooks of the proposed metrology and the further development. This document describes the activities performed and the results found, so far, in the HAALDM project.

Nanometrology deals with dimensional measurements of micro- and nanostructures with a high spatial resolution. It typically combines a microscope imaging with a precise coordinate measurement, usually capable of nanometre resolution using the state-of-art laser interferometry techniques. The development in this field is driven, among others, by emerging advanced nanotechnologies that demand to push further the capabilities and limits of the interferometric techniques to make the nanometre-level dimensional measurement of nanostructures possible. The principal limitations of current systems are the environmental conditions and especially the fluctuations in the refractive index of air. The theoretical part of this thesis aim at analysis of individual parts of laser interferometer. I oriented myself on the study of their advantages/disadvantages and further also the possibilities of their industrial applications. The second part of the thesis presents my work that focused on the influence of the refractive index of air (RIA) on the measurement uncertainty. I experimentally demonstrated an interferometric system with a self-cancellation RIA fluctuations: a transparent photodetector is used for the measurement of the standing wave along the axis of a passive resonator, where the resonator also serves as a reference for the laser wavelength stabilisation. Another optical arrangement, based on a setup of several Michelson interferometers, represents a combination of an interferometer and a refractometer into a single system. This setup was used to study the behaviour of the ambient airflow with respect to the optical path difference and physical separation of the interferometer’s and refractometer’s path. Based on the experimental results I proposed new arrangements for shape measuring interferometers, which combine length interferometry and a tracking refractometer for the direct compensation of RIA fluctuations with geometrically adjacent optical beams. The results indicate an improvement in RIA fluctuation induced uncertainty by a factor of 100. Third part describes the design and implementation of interferometric systems for specific applications. For the industrial environment I developed a compact interferometric displacement gauge which is designed to allow nanometre level measurement using a simplified interferometer construction. For coordinate measurement of the position of the sample up to six degrees of freedom, I realised a compact modular interferometric system, which represents a unique setup together with a stabilised laser source. To measure the position of the sample in an electron beam writer chamber, I designed and implemented a differential interferometer that works in the near infrared domain and uses a new detection method developed for this system. In the fourth part I describe the realisation of a high-speed interferometer with a differential arrangement, which allows evaluation of high-cycle fatigue in material engineering. This method of studying high-cycle fatigue should be beneficial for both the basic research and the engineering practice...|$|E
