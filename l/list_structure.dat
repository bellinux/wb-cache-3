25|$|Shape {{analysis}} of linked list data structures {{is a technique}} for verifying the correctness of an algorithm using those structures. If a node in the list incorrectly points to an earlier node in the same list, the structure will form a cycle that can be detected by these algorithms. In Common Lisp, the S-expression printer, under control of the *print-circle* variable, detects circular <b>list</b> <b>structure</b> and prints it compactly.|$|E

2500|$|Appending one {{linked list}} to another can be inefficient unless a {{reference}} to the tail is kept as part of the <b>List</b> <b>structure,</b> because we must traverse the entire first list in order to find the tail, and then append the second list to this.

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, simple linked lists by {{themselves}} {{do not allow}} random access to the data, or any form of efficient indexing. [...] Thus, many basic operations— such as obtaining the last node of the list (assuming that the last node is not maintained as separate node reference in the <b>list</b> <b>structure),</b> or finding a node that contains a given datum, or locating the place where a new node should be inserted— may require sequential scanning of {{most or all of}} the list elements. The advantages and disadvantages of using linked lists are given below.|$|E

The default settings show the music collection sorted by album, laying out the artwork in a grid similar to the iPad Music app (iOS 3.1-6.1.3, 8.4).

Users may alternately arrange their music collection as a list of every song, by genre, or by artist. These show details in a <b>list</b> <b>structure,</b> but the latter two include the album artwork as thumbnails to aid navigation. Items are automatically arranged alphabetically by album name, but users may rearrange this if using the song list option.|$|E
