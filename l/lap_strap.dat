40|$|A {{procedure}} is outlined and programmed in software {{in order to}} predict the fatigue threshold in composite adhesively bonded joints. Two different joint configurations are considered in this study, namely, Double Lap (DL) and <b>Lap</b> <b>Strap</b> (LS). The substrates are made of either uni-directional (UD) or multi-directional (MD) composite laminates and bonded together using an epoxy film adhesive. The theory of continuum damage mechanics {{has been used to}} develop damage evolution laws for UD/DL joints at different temperatures. The number of cycles to failure was then expressed in terms of the stresses in the adhesive layer and material constants (damage parameters). The stresses were calculated from non-linear finite element analyses. In order to calculate the damage parameters, a system of equations, in which the number of unknowns is less than the number of equations, has been derived using a combination of experimental data, finite element results and the damage law. The system of equations has been solved using the concept of pseudo-inverse by solving a singular value decomposition problem. Software has been developed to automatically calculate the damage parameters and produce the required load-number of cycle to failure curves. From those curves, the fatigue crack initiation thresholds were predicted for several joints, e. g. MD/DL, UD/LS and MD/LS joints. Good predictions were found...|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} is surveyed to determine human tolerance to rapidly applied accelerations. Pertinent {{human and animal}} experiments applicable to space flight and to crash impact forces are analyzed and discussed. These data are compared and presented {{on the basis of}} a trapezoidal pulse. The effects of body restraint and of acceleration direction, onset rate, and plateau duration on the maximum tolerable and survivable rapidly applied accelerations are shown. Results of the survey indicate that adequate torso and extremity restraint is the primary variable in tolerance to rapidly applied accelerations. The harness, or restraint system, must be arranged to transmit the major portion of the accelerating force directly to the pelvic structure and not via the vertebral column. When the conditions of adequate restraint have been met, then the other variables, direction, magnitude, and onset rate of rapidly applied accelerations, govern maximum tolerance and injury limits. The results also indicate that adequately stressed aft-faced passenger seats offer maximum complete body support with minimum objectionable harnessing. Such a seat, whether designed for 20 -, 30 -, or 40 -G dynamic loading, would include <b>lap</b> <b>strap,</b> chest (axillary) strap, and winged-back seat to increase headward and lateral G protection, full-height integral head rest, arm rests (load-bearing) with recessed hand-holds and provisions to prevent arms from slipping either laterally or beyond the seat back, and leg support to keep the legs from being wedged under the seat. For crew members and others whose duties require forward-facing seats, maximum complete body support requires lap, shoulder, and thigh straps, lap-belt tie-down strap, and full-height seat back with integral head support...|$|E

40|$|Stringer {{debonding}} within stiffened, assembled {{aerospace structures}} {{is one of}} the most critical damage scenarios that can occur in such structures. As a result, a degree of redundancy is inherently built-in to the design process of skin-stringer configurations to mitigate against premature and in-service failure. Introducing a “self-healing” solution for stringer run-out configurations has the benefit of mitigating and controlling damage initiation, and by introducing this concept there is great potential to reduce excessive conservative safety margins that could ultimately lead to more lightweight designs. Vascular self-healing technology has been successfully implemented into a simplified <b>strap</b> <b>lap</b> specimen, showing that the introduction of a vascular microchannel reduces the strength by 15 % but has little effect on the stiffness. Upon delivery and cure of epoxy-based self-healing agents full recovery of the mechanical properties was observed. This self-healing approach has been further implemented into industrially relevant, larger stringer run-out panels as a feasibility study, in which no knockdown to mechanical properties caused by the embedded vascular microchannels has been observed, this study has also shown similar promising results in terms of performance recovery...|$|R
40|$|The Constellation Program's Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) is {{required}} to accommodate the full population range of crewmembers according to the anthropometry requirements stated in the Human-Systems Integration Requirement (HSIR) document (CxP 70024). Seated height {{is one of many}} critical dimensions of importance to the CEV designers in determining the optimum seat configuration in the vehicle. Changes in seated height may have a large impact to the design, accommodation, and safety of the crewmembers. Seated height can change due to elongation of the spine when crewmembers are exposed to microgravity. Spinal elongation is the straightening of the natural curvature of the spine and the expansion of inter-vertebral disks. This straightening occurs due to fluid shifts in the body and the lack of compressive forces on the spinal vertebrae. Previous studies have shown that as the natural curvature of the spine straightens, an increase in overall height of 3 % of stature occurs which has been the basis of the current HSIR requirements. However due to variations in the torso/leg ratio and impact of soft tissue, data is nonexistent as to how spinal elongation specifically affects the measurement of seated height. In order to obtain this data, an experiment was designed to collect spinal elongation data while in a seated posture in microgravity. The {{purpose of this study was}} to provide quantitative data that represents the amount of change that occurs in seated height due to spinal elongation in microgravity environments. Given the schedule and budget constraints of ISS and Shuttle missions and the uniqueness of the problem, a methodology had to be developed to ensure that the seated height measurements were accurately collected. Therefore, simulated microgravity evaluations were conducted to test the methodology and procedures of the experiment. This evaluation obtained seat pan pressure and seated height data to a) ensure that the lap restraint provided sufficient restraint to eliminate any gap between the subject s gluteal surface and the seat pan and b) to document any necessary design and procedural changes needed due to the microgravity environment. The methodology and setup used during the simulated microgravity evaluations was replicable to the proposed methodology and setup for in-space missions. A flight-like Shuttle seat, pressure sensors, anthropometer, and existing hardware was used to measure seated height and contact area while experiencing microgravity. The outlying buttock and thigh surface contact areas were collected to determine if the subjects were in contact with the seat pan, while a measurer recorded their seated height with an anthropometer. The Anthropometry and Biomechanics Facility (ABF) completed data collection from three microgravity flights to assess the restraint methods and techniques to be used for the in-flight procedures performed by the crewmembers in orbit. The first flight demonstrated that the restraint system on the seat, used in a nominal configuration, did not sufficiently restrain a person in the seat. The results showed the subjects were not in full contact with the seat pan, resulting in inaccurate sitting height data. Thus, a second flight was conducted to test different restraint system options. The results showed that by 1) changing the restraint system from the nominal 3 -points of the 5 -point harness, which is used for crewmembers when fully suited with emergency equipment, and 2) rerouting the <b>lap</b> <b>straps</b> around the joint of the backrest, where the backrest and seat pan are joined, resulted in the optimal method to restrain a subject. This rerouting method allowed for the anchor location to change and pull the subjects back into the seat instead of being anchored at the side of the subjects thighs. The results from the third flight validated the final restraint system, which resulted in a verified methodology for collecting seated anthropometry to ultimately determine the amount of spil elongation in a microgravity environment...|$|R
40|$|A new traction-separation {{law that}} {{represents}} the constitutive relation of a ductile adhesive material in Mode I and Mode II is developed and introduced in interface elements for the finite element analysis of adhesive joints, {{within the framework of}} Cohesive Zone Modeling (CZM) techniques. The proposed law is based on the embedded process zone approach and is formulated to address the mixed-mode loading and fracture of adhesively bonded joints. This law is first used for the description of the pure Mode I (opening) and pure Mode II (sliding) loading and fracture and then it is integrated into a developed mixed-mode model in order to account for the dependence of the separate pure mode laws. The traction increasing part of the law is described by an exponential function, whereas the softening part is described by a linear decrease. Prediction of damage initiation is established through the nominal quadratic stress criterion, whereas the damage propagation is established through the linear energetic criterion. Experimental results from steel-to-steel single <b>lap</b> and Double <b>Strap</b> Joint configurations have been utilized for the validation of the proposed law and mixed-mode model. Comparisons are also provided from finite element analyses with the already known trapezoidal law and with the PRP (Park-Paulino-Roesler) model. The proposed law adequately captures the elastoplastic behaviour of the tested adhesive joints, in terms of their global response. Additionally, the strength of the tested joints is predicted with great accuracy. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
