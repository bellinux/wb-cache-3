5|$|Three contestants each {{take their}} place behind a <b>lectern,</b> with the {{returning}} champion occupying the leftmost <b>lectern</b> (from the viewer's perspective). The contestants compete in a quiz game comprising three rounds: Jeopardy!, Double Jeopardy!, and Final Jeopardy!. The material for the clues covers {{a wide variety of}} topics, including history and current events, the sciences, the arts, popular culture, literature, and languages. Category titles often feature puns, wordplay, or shared themes, and the host will regularly remind contestants of topics or place emphasis on category themes {{before the start of the}} round.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the antiquity of the font – probably the oldest piece visible in the church, aside from the Celtic crosses – the pulpit dates from 1879. It was presented by the Bishop of St David’s (the scholarly Basil Jones, bishop 1874–1897), in memory of his mother. It is in Beer stone ashlar Gothic, formed of a drum with two cusped panels with carved stone reliefs of Saints John and Paul by Hugh Stannus, with square rosettes and leaf-carving in spandrels flanking, and a Gothic column with a large capital for a book rest. Opposite this is the usual brass eagle <b>lectern.</b> Both pulpit and <b>lectern</b> are placed in the archway between crossing and nave.|$|E

50|$|<b>Lecterns</b> used in academia—generally in seminar {{rooms and}} lecture theatres—may have certain {{features}} that common <b>lecterns</b> lack, {{based on the}} technological sophistication of the venue. These features usually include a microphone stand, audio-visual controls, sometimes even an integrated computer and recording system. <b>Lecterns</b> of this sort are generally attached or integrated into a large desk, {{as the amount of}} support material tends to be larger in academic contexts than in straightforward public talks.|$|R

5|$|The stone nave pulpit was {{designed}} by the restorer R.C.Hussey and the <b>lectern,</b> dated 1876, is by Skidmore. The mosaic floor of the tower bay {{was designed}} by Dean Howson and executed by Burke and Co. The same firm installed the mosaics which decorate {{the wall of the}} north aisle, depicting the patriarchs and prophets Abraham, Moses, David and Elijah. They were designed by J.R.Clayton of Clayton and Bell, and date from 1883 to 86.|$|E

5|$|An oak made pulpit {{stands in}} front of the choir facing the nave. It {{originated}} in the north of France, probably in the mid-1500s. Its French Renaissance style suggests that it was made during the reign of Henry II. The <b>lectern</b> is also oak and dates from the 1600s. It had been used in a church near Avranches, France, for 200 years. A private individual purchased it shortly before the confiscation of church property during the French Revolution. It changed hands several times before Hibben obtained it for the chapel.|$|E
5|$|The bronze <b>lectern</b> {{was given}} to the College in 1654. The black and white marble paving dates from 1677–78. Except for the pews on the west, dating from 1884, the panelling, stalls and screens are all 17th-century, as are the altar and carved communion rails. Behind the altar is Bernard van Orley's The Carrying of the Cross — a companion-piece to this {{painting}} is in the National Gallery of Scotland. The organ case dates from 1716; originally designed by Christopher Schreider for St Mary Abbots Church, Kensington, it was acquired by Oriel in 1884.|$|E
5|$|The nave and chancel {{are divided}} from the aisles by seven-bay arcades, the piers being without capitals. At {{the top of}} each pier, facing the nave, is a carved human face. The roofs are divided into panels and contain much carving, {{including}} bosses (protrusions), shields, inscriptions and three pendants. The chapel at the west end of the south aisle is known as the Lady Chapel, and that on the north side is dedicated to Saint Mary. The church contains more medieval fittings and furniture than any other Cheshire church. Between the nave and the chancel is a screen, and there are parclose screens between the aisles and the chapels. The chancel screen, dated 1500, is elaborately carved with representations of birds, roses, vines and foliage. It has ten bays with lierne vaulting. The chancel stalls and the carved wooden eagle <b>lectern</b> date from around the same period. The <b>lectern</b> {{is one of the oldest}} eagle lecterns in the United Kingdom. The stalls have hinged seats, and formerly had misericords (shelves to support a standing person). Much of the furniture dates from the 17thcentury and is in Jacobean style. This includes the altar rails, the octagonal pulpit, the box pews, the reredos (screen behind the altar) in the Lady Chapel, and the font cover. The font itself is Perpendicular. The reredos in the chancel of 1866 was designed by the Manchester architect J. S. Crowther.|$|E
50|$|The first {{library at}} Christ Church was {{established}} in 1562 in {{what had been the}} refectory of St Frideswide's Priory. The books, of which around 140 remain in the library, were originally chained to wooden <b>lecterns.</b>|$|R

5|$|The north {{transept}} fittings {{are from}} 1936 and are by Caroe & Passmore. They include a finely carved reredos with panelling each side, the altar, rails (in {{the form of}} a long kneeler), a <b>lectern,</b> pews and kneelers, all in pale oak. The reredos has a carved Crucifixion, with St Mary and St John. There is a small Orthodox icon, a Theotokos, or Virgin and Child, {{to the right of the}} reredos. It is a reproduction of an early icon, printed on paper mounted on wood, from Stylite Icons, Welshpool, and probably dates from the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|In 1661, after Charles II was {{restored}} to the throne, Robert Creighton, the king's chaplain in exile, was appointed dean and was bishop {{for two years before}} his death in 1672. His brass <b>lectern,</b> given in thanksgiving, {{can be seen in the}} cathedral. He donated the nave's great west window at a cost of £140. Following Creighton's appointment as bishop, the post of dean went to Ralph Bathurst, who had been chaplain to the king, president of Trinity College, Oxford and fellow of the Royal Society. During Bathurst's long tenure the cathedral {{was restored}}, but in the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685, Puritan soldiers damaged the west front, tore lead from the roof to make bullets, broke the windows, smashed the organ and furnishings, and for a time stabled their horses in the nave.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{returned}} home when his state {{took up the}} issue of secession. His successor as governor, Isham G. Harris, and the legislature, organized a referendum on whether to have a constitutional convention to authorize secession; when that failed, they put the question of leaving the Union to a popular vote. Despite threats on Johnson's life, and actual assaults, he campaigned against both questions, sometimes speaking with a gun on the <b>lectern</b> before him. Although Johnson's eastern region of Tennessee was largely against secession, the second referendum passed, and in June 1861, Tennessee joined the Confederacy. Believing he would be killed if he stayed, Johnson fled through the Cumberland Gap, where his party was in fact shot at. He left his wife and family in Greeneville.|$|E

40|$|The Learning and Teaching Venues Committee at Murdoch University was {{tasked with}} {{developing}} "standards {{for the design}} of, and facilities in, existing and new learning and teaching venues, which {{meet the needs of}} a 'contemporary learning environment'". The committee was established following several years when little attention was directed at teaching spaces, and facilities were becoming shabby. A further context for this work is a university-wide curriculum renewal aimed at reducing the number of courses and units offered. While this will result in larger class sizes, the central vision is to offer units which have more emphasis on active learning and interaction, as well as increased use of educational technology. This presentation will describe the role of the committee in developing those standards. Work started by defining some general principles about modern learning and teaching spaces: •	Facilities and furniture should enable spaces to be used in flexible ways for multiple teaching approaches; •	Teaching spaces should be designed for interaction and collaboration; •	Tiered spaces should have wide tiers so students can collaborate eye-to-eye; •	<b>Lecterns</b> in all spaces should have a range of movement to allow different uses of space. •	<b>Lecterns</b> should be height adjustable to suit people of all sizes. •	There will be consultation with, and engagement with, all stakeholders in the design of spaces; •	The design of spaces sends a message to teachers about how these spaces can be used; •	Ensure professional development occurs before staff start using a new space; •	All spaces should have easy-to-use instructions for all equipment; •	Use existing surfaces (walls, windows, tables) for writing, rather than whiteboards; Different equipment and furniture is needed for different sized rooms. We distinguished between Lecture theatres (with tiered seating); Tutorial rooms (< 25 students); Workshop rooms (26 - 50 students); Seminar rooms (51 - 100 students); and various laboratories. The facilities in these spaces {{need to be able to}} be used in flexible ways for different purposes. For example, the same space may be used for interactive tutorials, group work or lectures in low-enrolment units. These may require different seating arrangements: U-shaped, in clusters or theatre style. The 800 x 600 mm 'exam tables' and plastic chairs in existing spaces were unsuitable for this purpose, and the committee recommended that tables should be larger, and on casters for easy movement. Chairs should have ergonomic functions, and be on wheels. The committee spent much time considering how best to provide computer control facilities - <b>lecterns.</b> Different sized <b>lecterns</b> are envisaged in the different room types. Lecture Theatre <b>lecterns</b> are widely used and well-understood, as long as they enable height-challenged presenters to be seen. These are usually fixed. However, in smaller spaces, <b>lecterns</b> require a range of movement to allow different uses of space. In seminar rooms, <b>lecterns</b> should be configured for a standing presenter, but in smaller rooms, it is more appropriate for a presenter to be seated. In any case, some height adjustability is required to accommodate different body shapes and people with disabilities. This presentation will describe the current state of play in the emerging learning and teaching space standards at Murdoch University, and engage the audience in conversation about what they think should be in a modern classroom...|$|R
50|$|The Hamilton Psalter {{picture of}} the shrine in the monastery appears to show the icon behind a golden screen of large mesh, mounted on {{brackets}} rising from a four-sided pyramidal base, like many large medieval <b>lecterns.</b> The heads of the red-robed attendants are level with the bottom frame of the icon.|$|R
5|$|Since the Reformation, {{the nave}} {{is that part}} of the {{building}} which is usually open to and most used by the congregation and general public. There is also, usually in the nave, a raised pulpit from which the dean or other clergy can expound the scriptures. In the late 20th century it became customary in some cathedrals for an hourly prayer to be said, for the benefit of visitors, and this is often presented from the nave pulpit. In a large cathedral, particularly in those where the building is divided by a screen as at Canterbury, an altar may be set at the eastern end of the nave so that services might be held there for large congregations. At each place where services are held there is a <b>lectern</b> on which rests a Bible.|$|E
5|$|The intense {{competition}} for congregations {{also led to}} changes to make worship more attractive that were reflected in architecture. The Church of Scotland {{was among the first}} European Protestant churches to engage in liturgical innovation reflected in seating arrangements, abandoning box pews for open benches. From {{the middle of the nineteenth}} century some of its churches, like Greyfriars in Edinburgh, began installing organs and stained glass windows, reflecting an attempt to return to forms of worship largely excluded since the late seventeenth century. At Duns the church was rebuilt (opened 1888) in a plan used in the Middle Ages, with a separate chancel, communion table at the far end, and the pulpit under the chancel arch. The influence of the ecclesiological movement can be seen in churches built at Crathie (opened 1893), which had an apsidal chancel raised above the level of the nave, a stone pulpit and a brass <b>lectern,</b> and St. Cuthbert's, Edinburgh (rebuilt 1894), with a marble communion table in a chancel decorated with marble and mosaic.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the church consists of a large, open floor plan, with wooden pews lined perpendicular {{to the north and}} south sides, thus creating a central aisle. The altar is a small wooden pulpit, which serves as a <b>lectern</b> that is accessible by a small wooden step; the altar is accented by a large wooden backdrop of casing with dentil molding. Each of the church's interior walls is covered with pine wainscot panelling and wallpaper, and topped with wooden crown molding. Wooden swag moldings accentuate the four symmetrically-placed six-over-six double-hung sash wooden windows, the doorway's wooden casing, and the transom window. The wooden pews are simple, with cushions added for comfortable seating. The original ceiling is obscured by a dropped ceiling, which also conceals the electrical conduits for the church's brass chandeliers. Prior to the church's electrification, kerosene lanterns were used for light, and the lanterns remain in the church for decorative purposes. The church's floor consists of the original heart pine planks. Concrete blocks and cut stone border the building's perimeter to prevent animals from entering the church's crawl space. Within the crawl space, log carrier beams support the building, on which the bark remains extant.|$|E

5|$|In the Mainwaring chapel is the canopied wall tomb of SirWilliam Mainwaring of Baddiley and Peover {{who died}} in 1399. His effigy is in alabaster, it is {{recumbent}} and dressed in plate armour as a knight. His head rests on a helm bearing an ass's head and around his neck is a gold collar of esses. The rest of the monument is in red sandstone. At {{the east end of}} the south aisle is a marble tomb commemorating SirRichard Wilbraham (1578–1643), his son SirThomas Wilbraham (1601–1660) and their wives. It includes the recumbent effigies in marble of SirThomas and his wife, Elizabeth. At the east end of the south aisle is an ancient piscina which is in good condition. In the chancel is another piscina and a sedilia, both of which are damaged. The screen in the Dorfold chapel is dated 1685 while that dividing the chancel from the nave is from a later date. The communion rail is also dated 1685. The brass chandelier dates from the 18thcentury. Stained glass in the east window and in windows of the south aisle is by Kempe and is dated between 1885 and 1888. The reredos includes the Ten Commandments {{to the north of the}} altar and the Lord's Prayer and the Creed to the south. The carved oak pulpion a stone base and the oak eagle <b>lectern</b> date from the 19thcentury.|$|E
5|$|Some of the cathedral's {{fittings}} {{and monuments}} {{are hundreds of}} years old. The brass <b>lectern</b> in the Lady Chapel dates from 1661 and has a moulded stand and foliate crest. In the north transept chapel is a 17th-century oak screen with columns, formerly used in cow stalls, with artisan Ionic capitals and cornice, set forward over the chest tomb of John Godelee. There is a bound oak chest from the 14th century, which was used to store the chapter seal and key documents. The bishop's throne dates from 1340, and has a panelled, canted front and stone doorway, and a deep nodding cusped ogee canopy above it, with three-stepped statue niches and pinnacles. The throne was restored by Anthony Salvin around 1850. Opposite the throne is a 19th-century octagonal pulpit on a coved base with panelled sides, and steps up from the north aisle. The round font in the south transept is from the former Saxon cathedral and has an arcade of round-headed arches, on a round plinth. The font cover was made in 1635 and is decorated with the heads of putti. The Chapel of St Martin is a memorial to every Somerset man who fell in World War I.|$|E
