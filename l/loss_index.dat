Therefore, for processes where the quality characteristic is the location relative to a specific location, they can not provide an effective measure. In this paper, we propose a process <b>loss</b> <b>index</b> LG to evaluate the process capability for this issue. Based on the index, we provide the corresponding transformation for production yield.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a {{detailed}} analysis of industry loss warranties (ILWs), an alternative risk transfer instrument which has become increasingly popular throughout the last few years. Design/methodology/approach – The authors first point out key characteristics of ILWs important to investor and cedent, including transaction costs, moral hazard, basis risk, counterparty risk, industry <b>loss</b> <b>index,</b> and regulation. Next, the authors present and discuss the adequacy of actuarial and financial approaches for pricing ILWs, as well as the aspects of basis risk. Finally, drivers of demand and associated models frameworks from the purchaser's viewpoint are studied. Findings – Financial pricing approaches for ILWs are highly sensitive to input parameters, which is important given the high volatility of the underlying <b>loss</b> <b>index.</b> In addition, the underlying assumption of replicability of the claims is not without problems. Due to their simple and standardized structure and the dependence on a transparent industry <b>loss</b> <b>index,</b> ILWs are low-barrier products, which can also be offered by hedge funds. In principle, traditional reinsurance contracts are still preferred as a measure of risk transfer, especially since these are widely accepted for solvency capital reduction. However, the main important impact factor for the demand of ILWs from the perspective of market participants, i. e. large diversified reinsurers and hedge funds, is the lower price due to rather low transaction costs and less documentation effort. Hence, ILWs are attractive despite the introduction of basis risk and the still somewhat opaque regulatory environment. Research limitations/implications – An important issue for future research is how reinsureds deal with the basis risk inherent in ILWs. Another central point is the development of a European industry <b>loss</b> <b>index</b> and the creation of an exchange platform to enable an even higher degree of standardization and a faster processing of transactions. Originality/value – ILWs feature an industry <b>loss</b> <b>index</b> to be triggered, and, in some cases, a double-trigger design that includes a company indemnity trigger. ILW contracts belong to the class of alternative risk transfer instruments that have become increasingly popular, especially in the retrocession reinsurance market. There has been no comprehensive analysis of these instruments in academic literature to date. Consequently, the authors believe that this paper provides a high degree of originality.

40|$|Background—Fluid {{energy loss}} across {{stenotic}} aortic valves {{is influenced by}} factors other than the valve effective orifice area (EOA). We propose a new index that will provide a more accurate estimate of this energy loss. Methods and Results—An experimental model was designed to measure EOA and energy loss in 2 fixed stenoses and 7 bioprosthetic valves for different flow rates and 2 different aortic sizes (25 and 38 mm). The {{results showed that the}} relationship between EOA and energy loss is influenced by both flow rate and aortic cross-sectional area (AA) and that the energy loss is systematically higher (1562 %) in the large aorta. The coefficient (EOA 3 AA) /(AA 2 EOA) accurately predicted the energy loss in all situations (r 250. 98). This coefficient is more closely related to the increase in left ventricular workload than EOA. To account for varying flow rates, the coefficient was indexed for body surface area in a retrospective study of 138 patients with moderate or severe aortic stenosis. The energy <b>loss</b> <b>index</b> measured by Doppler echocardiography was superior to the EOA in predicting the end points, which were defined as death or aortic valve replacement. An energy <b>loss</b> <b>index</b> # 0. 52 cm 2 /m 2 was the best predictor of adverse outcomes (positive predictive value of 67 %). Conclusions—This new energy <b>loss</b> <b>index</b> has the potential to reflect the severity of aortic stenosis better than EOA. Further prospective studies are necessary to establish the relevance of this index in terms of clinical outcomes. (Circulation. 2000; 101 : 765 - 771. ...|$|E

A widespread {{explanation of the}} enactment effect {{is based on the}} distinction between item-specific and relational information. There is widespread agreement that the main reason is the excellent item-specific encoding by enactment. However, there is little direct evidence in the case of free recall. The role of relational information is less clear. We suggest that content-based relational encoding is better in VTs than in SPTs. In three experiments, in which multiple free recall testing used item gains and <b>losses</b> as <b>indices</b> of item-specific and content-based relational encoding respectively, these assumptions were confirmed. Consistently more gains (indexing better item-specific encoding) and more <b>losses</b> (<b>indexing</b> poorer relational encoding) were observed in SPTs than in VTs (Experiments 1 and 2).

40|$|By {{approaching}} capability {{from the}} point of view of process loss similar to Cpm, Johnson (1992) provided the expected relative loss Le to consider the proximity of the target value. Putting the loss in relative terms, a user needs only to specify the target and the distance from the target at which the product would have zero worth to quantify the process loss. Tsui (1997) expressed the index Le as Le = Lot + Lpe, which provides an uncontaminated separation between information concerning the process relative off-target loss (Lot) and the process relative inconsistency loss (Lpe). Unfortunately, the index Le inconsistently measures process capability in many cases, particularly for processes with asymmetric tolerances, and thus reflects process potential and performance inaccurately. In this paper, we consider a generalization, which we refer to as [image omitted]�, to deal with processes with asymmetric tolerances. The generalization is shown to be superior to the original index Le. In the cases of symmetric tolerances, the new generalization of process <b>loss</b> <b>indices</b> [image omitted]�, [image omitted]� and [image omitted]� reduces to the original index Le, Lot, and Lpe, respectively.
