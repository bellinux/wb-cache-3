40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of a videotaped model of a conductor, utilizing various <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> conducting gestures, on singers’ anticipated inappropriate vocal tension levels, given the meaning interpreted from a gesture. Specifically, the potential of <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> conducting gestures to generate or prevent perceptions of inappropriate vocal tension was examined. A stimulus tape was created including a control conducting condition (<b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> no change) and five experimental conducting conditions: (a) <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> fisted gesture; (b) <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> palm up; (c) <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> palm down; (d) <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> stabbing gesture; and (e) <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> sideways, phrase-shaping gesture...|$|R

50|$|In the laboratory, {{a patient}} was given two {{different}} fabrics: a wire screen in his <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> {{and a piece}} of sandpaper in his right hand. The patient received two different fabrics out of his view so that neither eye nor hemisphere visually seen what his hands were given. When the patient was indicating what fabric was in the <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> he was able to correctly indicate and point with the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> to the wire screen after it had been set on a table. As he pointed with his <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> however, the right hand tried to stop the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> and make the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> point to the fabric that the right hand was holding. The <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> continued to point at the correct fabric, even though the right hand tried to forcefully move the <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b> During the struggle, the patient also verbalized feelings of animosity by saying, “That’s wrong!” and “I hate this hand”. Joseph concluded that the left hemisphere did not understand at all why the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> (right hemisphere) would point to a different material.|$|R

50|$|The entire {{harmonic}} structure, {{save for}} one note, is constructed {{so that the}} <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> part is the highest note in a B Minor chord which is below the melody line. Thus, when the melody is on a C# or D, the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> is on a B. When the melody is on an E or F#, the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> is on a D, and when the melody is on a G, A, or B, the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> is on an F#. The only break from this harmonic structure appears when the <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> hits a C# below an F# in the right hand, synchronous {{with the release of}} the pedal {{at the end of the}} 11th bar.|$|R

50|$|Due to the {{mechanism}} of the puppets, all puppets' <b>left</b> <b>hands</b> {{are designed to be}} their most expressive part. Hence, all puppets wield their weapons with their <b>left</b> <b>hands,</b> making them appear left-handed. Since puppeteers are mostly right-handed, the puppets are designed to fully occupy their right hands by supporting the puppets' full body weight, each of which weighs an average of 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds), and control most of the puppets' internal mechanisms: including head tilts, eye blinks, mouth movements, and the puppets' right arms; while the puppeteers' <b>left</b> <b>hands</b> control the <b>left</b> <b>hands</b> of the puppets and their puppets' foot movements.|$|R
