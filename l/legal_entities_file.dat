40|$|Utilizing {{a random}} sample of 80 Canadian public companies, this thesis {{establishes}} that {{a significant increase in the}} number and magnitude of deferred income tax drawdowns occurred in the recessionary period of the early 1980 s. The behaviour of deferred income tax expense is then investigated to determine if the observed increase in drawdowns related to a reduction in fixed asset additions or was the result of accounting losses.;The existing literature on deferred income taxes implicitly assumes that drawdowns are the result of involuntary reversals of timing differences that result in a sacrifice of economic resources. However, the data gathered from financial statements leads one to believe that many drawdowns, and in particular the larger ones, are the result of accounting losses.;It was not possible to determine the exact proportion of drawdowns resulting from losses as current Canadian accounting standards do not require that the reason for a drawdown be provided. For this reason, the researcher contacted management of 13 of the companies experiencing drawdowns in the early 1980 s. The result was a substantiation of the belief that losses were a very important factor underlying the increase in drawdowns. It is believed that this has the potential to mislead a financial statement reader as a company 2 ̆ 7 s consolidated financial statements can indicate a profit, yet the drawdown can relate to losses in one or more subsidiaries. This is due to a Canadian requirement that each <b>legal</b> <b>entity</b> <b>file</b> its own separate tax return and therefore each separate <b>legal</b> <b>entity</b> in the consolidated group must individually determine its deferred income tax.;In addition, a review of companies notes relating to loss carryforwards indicated potential departures from the CICA Handbook and a lack of data that the researcher believes is necessary for a usesr to make an assessment of the potential benefit that may be associated with these loss carryforwards.;Partial tax allocation, using the deferral method, is recommended for rapid write-off assets such as Class 29 assets, but the critical recommendations relate to disclosure. Current Canadian accounting standards do not require disclosure of the reasons for changes in deferred income taxes, yet the data analyzed shows that it is not possible to make accurate inferences about this behaviour from companies 2 ̆ 7 financial statements. The recommendations on disclosure are designed to rectify this problem...|$|R

40|$|<b>Legal</b> <b>entities</b> play an {{important}} role in our society. Many social and economic activities are carried out by organizations which are <b>legal</b> <b>entities,</b> generally under public or private law. The existence of such <b>legal</b> <b>entities</b> raises several questions, such as who can be held responsible or liable if the <b>legal</b> <b>entity's</b> activities violate a legal standard. In principle the <b>legal</b> <b>entity</b> is liable for the consequences of its actions. However, a <b>legal</b> <b>entity</b> is itself incapable of physical action; its actions can always be traced back to those of human beings. This thesis examines the circumstances in which the managers of <b>legal</b> <b>entities</b> under private and public law can be held liable if the <b>legal</b> <b>entity's</b> activities are punishable, cause loss to a third party and/or contravene administrative standards. After all, managers are responsible for the <b>legal</b> <b>entity's</b> affairs. Executives may cause the violation of legal standards by their own actions, but they may also be accused of having failed to provide adequate supervision or having failed to prevent or stop others (subordinates or fellow managers) acting in such a way that legal standards were violated. Moreover, the executive's formal and/or actual position of power may mean that he or she must ensure that the violation is reversed or that the <b>legal</b> <b>entity</b> complies with the legal standard. In such cases the executive's liability can be regarded as secondary liability, since it is the <b>legal</b> <b>entity</b> itself which has broken the law; in other words, the <b>legal</b> <b>entity</b> has the primary liability. ...|$|R

The criminal law is being traditionally linked {{to the criminal liability}} of an individual. The social environment has changed in the last decades {{in such a way that}} it was vital to reflect its negative consequences. In a number of EU countries, the action resulted in implementation of criminal lability of <b>legal</b> <b>entities.</b> The Czech Republic used to be a country where the criminal lability of <b>legal</b> <b>entities</b> was not complied with for many years.
