50|$|The {{nature of}} road {{transportation}} of goods depends, apart from the degree of development of the local infrastructure, on the distance the goods are transported by road, the weight and volume of an individual shipment, {{and the type of}} goods transported.

(Also see Trucking and Hauling below). In some countries cargo is transported by road in horse-drawn carriages, donkey carts or other non-motorized mode.

40|$|We {{introduce}} the polynomial time version, in short <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(T) (P) -introreducibility, {{of the notion}} of introreducibility studied in Recursion Theory. We give a simpler proof of the known fact that a set is <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(T) (P) -introreducible if and only if it is in P. Our proof generalizes to virtually all the computation bounded reducibilities <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(r), showing that a set is <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(r) -introreducible if and only if it belongs to the minimum <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(r) -degree. It also holds for most unbounded reducibilities like <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(m), <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(c), <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(d), <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(p), <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(tt), etc., but it does not hold for <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(T). A very strong way for a set L to fail being <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(r) -introreducible is that L is not <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to(r) -reducible to any coinfinite subset of L.

40|$|Intra-abdominal {{pressure}} (IAP), measured via a transurethral catheter, hemodynamic, and renal functions {{were evaluated}} in 25 cirrhotic patients admitted to ICU with variceal bleeding, tense ascites, and peripheral edema. In patients with an IAP greater than 25 cm H 2 O, a paracentesis {{was performed to}} decrease the IAP by 10 cm H 2 O. After paracentesis, {{a decrease in the}} IAP from 33. 47 to 19. 06 cm H 2 O (p <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 0. 001) resulted in a decrease in total peripheral resistance (TPR) (p <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 0. 01) and a significant increase in cardiac index (CI) (p <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 0. 001), stroke index (p <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 0. 001), left ventricular stroke work (LVSW) (p <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 0. 01), and right ventricular stroke work (p <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 0. 01). The therapeutic effects of paracentesis on renal function were: a decrease in BUN and serum creatinine (p <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 0. 001) and an increase in the creatinine clearance (Ccr) (p <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 0. 001), urine volume (p <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 0. 001), osmolar clearance (Cosm) (p <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 0. 001), and urine creatinine (p <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 0. 001) values.

40|$|Relationships {{have been}} {{observed}} between lipoprotein concentrations and insulin action. These relationships may be important in explaining the association of insulin resistance and abnormalities of lipoprotein metabolism found in obesity, diabetes, and hypertriglyceridemia. We have measured plasma lipoprotein concentrations and indices of insulin action in 85 men and 56 women, {{all of whom were}} normolipidemic and had normal glucose tolerance. The subjects were obese Southwestern American Indians (body mass index 34 +/- 1). Insulin action was measured via the hyperinsulinemic clamp with simultaneous indirect calorimetry. Triglyceride concentrations were inversely related to rates of total insulin-mediated glucose disposal (in men and women, respectively, r = -. 37, P <b>less</b> <b>than.</b> 01; r = -. 24, P <b>less</b> <b>than.</b> 10), glucose storage (r = -. 31, P <b>less</b> <b>than.</b> 01; r = -. 25, P <b>less</b> <b>than.</b> 10), increase in glucose oxidation (r = -. 29, P <b>less</b> <b>than.</b> 01; r = -. 24, P <b>less</b> <b>than.</b> 10), and, in men only, suppression of endogenous glucose production (r = -. 32, P <b>less</b> <b>than.</b> 01).
