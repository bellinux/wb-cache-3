5|$|Just as the team's {{competitive}} {{season was}} nearing its end, <b>Lance</b> <b>Armstrong</b> {{announced that he}} planned to return to competitive cycling in 2009 after a four-year absence.

5|$|During its {{six years}} as the Tour DuPont, the race was won by Dutch rider Erik Breukink, Greg LeMond, Raúl Alcalá, Russian Viatcheslav Ekimov, and twice by <b>Lance</b> <b>Armstrong.</b> Over this time, a prologue time trial held in Wilmington, Delaware, became the {{traditional}} start to the race. Between 1992 and 1994, the race included a stage from Port Deposit and Hagerstown in Maryland, but in 1995, South Carolina was included on the route {{for the first time}} in its place.

5|$|The {{race was}} held in the mid-Atlantic states, {{including}} areas near DuPont's Wilmington, Delaware, headquarters. DuPont withdrew their sponsorship of the race after the 1996 edition, and the event has not been run since. During the eight-year history of the race as both the Tour de Trump and the Tour DuPont, it was won twice by the Mexican rider Raúl Alcalá and twice by the American <b>Lance</b> <b>Armstrong.</b> The race was cited as evidence of Richmond, Virginia's ability to host international cycle racing when the city successfully bid for the 2015 UCI Road World Championships.|$|E

The day saw a big winner in time gains and a big loser: <b>Lance</b> <b>Armstrong</b> finished 29 seconds behind Di Luca in the same group as the man finishing sixth on the stage, gaining seven places in the GC, while Thomas Lövkvist lost over a minute and fell from second to eighth in the GC.|$|E

5|$|<b>Lance</b> <b>Armstrong</b> {{was removed}} from the head of the list after having all seven of his Tour {{victories}} stripped when he was found guilty of repeated doping offences. Had his tainted Tour victories been reallocated (as were the victories of Floyd Landis and Contador) to the second placed rider in each race, Jan Ullrich would have joined the list with 4 Tour wins. However, the race organisers ASO have decided not to reallocate the titles won in those years, in recognition of the historic doping problem in the sport at that time - Ullrich himself having been banned for a doping violation. Ullrich, therefore, has a single Tour victory to his name.|$|E
5|$|After Trump {{withdrew from}} {{sponsoring}} the event, DuPont became the primary sponsor. Between 1991 and 1995, national amateur teams took part alongside professional teams. The event attracted well-known competitors, including <b>Lance</b> <b>Armstrong</b> and Greg LeMond, and {{was attended by}} high-profile European-based professional cycling teams. In 1996, the Union Cycliste Internationale upgraded it to a 2.1 ranked race, meaning that amateurs could no longer compete. This made the race the highest ranked outside of Europe and the first North American stage race to be ranked 2.1. The 1996 race {{was the subject of}} a number of legal issues, including a dispute over rights to its profits between the race owners, Billy Packer and president of the United States Cycling Federation Mike Plant, which resulted in them suing each other. DuPont itself was involved in a dispute about the anti-homosexual employment policies of the local government in Greenville, South Carolina, with the company insisting that the race organizers exclude the city from the route. After 1996, DuPont dropped its sponsorship and the race has not been run since.|$|E
