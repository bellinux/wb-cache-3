40|$|Abstract Male group-living {{cichlids}} show {{status and}} strategic adjustments in growth, but females appear {{not to show}} these growth adjustments. Here, an experimental study in the Lake Tanganyika cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher elaborates on these findings. Females did not show status-dependent growth: (1) Growth in females decelerated with body size but did not depend on social status (breeder or <b>helper),</b> and (2) <b>female</b> <b>helpers</b> did not increase their growth rate after becoming a breeder. Females showed limited evidence for strategic growth: (3) <b>Female</b> <b>helpers</b> did not significantly adjust their growth rate depending on the treatments (comparing <b>female</b> <b>helpers</b> living in groups with a small or a large breeder female); but within the small breeder <b>female</b> treatment, <b>helper</b> growth {{was significantly related to}} their body size difference (breeder size–helper size), suggesting a strong non-linear effect of size differ-ences on <b>female</b> <b>helper</b> growth. I conclude that these female cichlids show no status-dependent growth and only strate-gic growth adjustments when the size difference between the <b>helper</b> <b>female</b> and her breeder female is particularly small...|$|R

25|$|Unlike {{associate}} <b>females</b> or co-foundresses, <b>helpers</b> typically share {{genetic relatedness}} with the foundress. <b>Female</b> <b>helpers</b> indirectly obtain benefits in fitness because the reproductive {{duration of the}} foundress is relatively short. Thus, the line {{to become the next}} dominant is not long. Many <b>female</b> <b>helpers</b> possess fully developed ovaries and the ability to produce male and female offspring. This anatomical feature of helpers may be indicative of a selective trait for preparedness for when the current dominant female stops reproducing. Most females will become egg-layers whether on a new nest or their natal nest.|$|R

40|$|Despite its {{importance}} {{for the evolution of}} cooperative breeding, it has proven difficult to determine whether helpers improve their recipients’ fitness. Helpers affect fitness in multiple ways, both positive and negative, but their effects can also be concealed through reduced maternal investment. Furthermore, determining the direction of causation is difficult, as helper presence may indicate a productive territory, rather than high productivity indicating an effect of help. In cooperatively breeding red-winged fairy-wrens (Malurus elegans) groups reduce care when they have male helpers, but groups with <b>female</b> <b>helpers</b> do not, so nestlings receive more food. Thus our predictions vary with helper sex rather than helper number, and by studying within-group changes with regard to group composition we separate phenotypically plastic responses from among-group correlations. Females did not reduce egg size in response to an increasing number of <b>female</b> <b>helpers.</b> However, more male or <b>female</b> <b>helpers</b> allowed <b>females</b> to lay larger clutches and more <b>female</b> <b>helpers</b> reduced re-nesting intervals. There was mixed support for a benefit of load lightening: Helpers, but not breeders, gained survival benefits with increasing number of male helpers. However, helper survival decreased with the number of <b>female</b> <b>helpers,</b> suggesting that increased competition counterbalanced these male helper benefits. We also found consistent among-group differences, which would have erroneously been interpreted as helper effects had we not disentangled the within-group changes with regard to group composition. This study highlights the importance of assessing carers’ benefits in relation to both group composition and size, and of investigating the within-individual plastic response of helper effects...|$|R

40|$|In {{groups of}} the cooperatively {{breeding}} laughing kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae), offspring sex varied {{with the type of}} social group and with hatch rank. Groups with <b>female</b> <b>helpers,</b> especially if all <b>helpers</b> were <b>female,</b> had male-biased clutch and fledging sex ratios. Groups without <b>female</b> <b>helpers</b> (unassisted pairs or male-only helpers) had female-biased clutch and fledging sex ratios. Breeding females responded facultatively to increases in the number of <b>female</b> <b>helpers</b> in their group by producing more male eggs. These biases may occur if breeding females try {{to limit the number of}} daughters recruited into their group because unlike male <b>helpers,</b> <b>female</b> <b>helpers</b> depress the breeding success of their parents. Across all nests, two-thirds of first-hatched young were male, two-thirds of second-hatched young were female, and the sex ratio of third-hatched young was even. Hatch rank sex ratios also varied dramatically between different types of social groups, from 16. 7 % for second-hatched nestlings of unassisted pairs to 100 % for first-hatched nestlings of groups with only <b>female</b> <b>helpers.</b> A corollary of the relationship between hatch rank and sex was that hatching sex sequences were distributed nonrandomly: all groups avoided hatching a daughter first followed by a son (FM). Sibling competition is aggressive and sometimes fatal. Since females grow to be 15 % larger than males the hatching sequence of sexes could affect nestling growth and mortality. However, an exhaustive analysis found little evidence that growth or survival of males was compromised if hatched after a sister. The small number of FM sequences may only have occurred in nests that were able to ameliorate any negative consequences. Alternatively, when clutch size is small and fledging success unpredictable because of brood reduction, the preferred brood sex ratio may be contingent on the number of fledge...|$|R

40|$|Natural populations might exhibit {{resilience}} {{to changing}} climatic conditions if they already show adaptive flexibility in their reproductive strategies. In cooperative breeders, theory predicts that mothers with helpers should provide less care when environmental conditions are favourable, but maintain high investment when conditions are challenging. Here, we test {{for evidence of}} climate-mediated flexibility in maternal investment in the cooperatively breeding superb fairy-wren Malurus cyaneus We focus on egg size because in this species egg size influences offspring size, and females reduce egg investment when there are helpers at the nest.

40|$|Helpers in cooperatively {{breeding}} species forego {{all or part}} {{of their}} reproduction when remaining at home and assisting breeders to raise offspring. Different models of reproductive skew generate alternative predictions about the share of reproduction unrelated subordinates will get depending on the degree of ecological constraints. Concession models predict a larger share when independent breeding options are good, whereas restraint and tug-of-war models predict no effects on reproductive skew. We tested these predictions by determining the share of reproduction by unrelated male and <b>female</b> <b>helpers</b> in the Lake Tanganyika cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher depending on experimentally manipulated possibilities for helper dispersal and independent breeding and depending on helper size and sex. We created 32 breeding groups in the laboratory, consisting of two breeders and two helpers each, where only the helpers had access to a nearby dispersal compartment with (treatment) or without (control) breeding substrate, using a repeated measures design. We determined the paternity and maternity of 1185 offspring from 47 broods using five to nine DNA microsatellite loci and found that: (1) helpers participated in reproduction equally across the treatments, (2) large male helpers {{were significantly more likely to}} reproduce than small helpers, and (3) male helpers engaged in significantly more reproduction than <b>female</b> <b>helpers.</b> Interestingly, in four broods, extragroup helper males had fertilized part of the brood. No helper evictions from the group after helper reproduction were observed.

Female breeders produced larger clutches in the treatment compared to the control situation when the large helpers were males. This suggests that male breeder-male helper reproductive conflicts may be alleviated by females producing larger clutches with helpers aroun...|$|R
40|$|Summary. In many {{bees and}} wasps, solitary females produce {{offspring}} without help from other females. The transition from lone mothers producing offspring to {{situations in which}} females often help to rear siblings {{is an important step}} in the origins of complex sociality and nonreproductive castes. Recent work on Hymenoptera has stressed the role of sex ratio variation in this transition; when a mother's brood is more female biased than average, older daughters are favored to help rear their younger siblings because they are more closely related to sisters than to their own offspring. Here the direction of causality is from biased sex ratios, which arise by some extrinsic mechanism, to the origins of sib-rearing (eusociality). We present a model {{in which there is a}} synergism between sib-rearing and female-biased sex ratios, which may either complement the sex ratio variation idea by increasing the rate at which helping spreads or be an alternative hypothesis about the origins of eusociality. The synergism in our model depends on three conditions. 1) Daughters that help cause more food to be provisioned per offspring, which in turn causes larger offspring. 2) Females gain more than males by being large, which favors mothers with helpers to produce a higher proportion of daughters. 3) A helper's inclusive fitness rises as her mother's brood becomes increasingly female biased because a <b>female</b> <b>helper</b> is more closely related to her sisters than to her brothers. A <b>female</b> <b>helper</b> may also be more closely related to her sisters than to her own offspring, but this particular sibling-offspring relatedness asymmetry is not required by the synergism model. These three conditions create a synergism which favors a rapid transition from solitary (subsocial) to eusocial. De-Present address and address for offprint requests: S. A. Frank...|$|R
