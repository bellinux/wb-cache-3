The distribution of cluster ions produced by <b>laser</b> single <b>ablation</b> {{is different from}} that produced by <b>laser</b> double <b>ablation.</b> By <b>laser</b> single <b>ablation</b> on a mixed Pb 1 S target, PbnSn 211 and PbnSn 2 are formed as stable compositions that serve as structural skeletons of the binary clusters. All other cluster ions can be indicated as PbnSm 1 with m $ n 2 1 or PbnSm 2 with m $ n, produced by the attachment of excess S atoms to PbnSn 211 or PbnSn 2. The stable compositions shown above are also found in the fragments from the main photodissociation channels of cluster cations, confirming their special stability. The structural models of the cluster ions with stable compositions are proposed. On the other hand, by <b>laser</b> double <b>ablation</b> on a separated Pb target and S target, the Pb clusters and S clusters are formed independently and then react with each other to generate binary cluster ions PbnSm 1 and PbnSm 2 with n 5 1 – 7 and m $ 0.

Experimental {{results show that}} there exists a temporal ablation window effect {{with each of the}} double pulses adjusted just smaller than the threshold. When the delay between the double pulses is within the order of 400 ps, the ablation of Cr film could happen. When the delay between the double pulses is beyond the order of 400 ps, the ablation of Cr film would not happen, and the reflectivity {{from the surface of the}} Cr film shows a sharp rise at the same time. The two-temperature model was developed into the form of double pulses to explain the experimental phenomena. Furthermore, microbump structures were formed on the surface of Cr film after ablation by ultrafast double pulses. Their heights exhibit an obvious drop between 1 and 10 ps double pulses delay, which is involved with the electron-phonon coupling process according to the numerical simulation.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{visual quality}} differences between intraocular lenses (IOLs) {{in patients with}} previous myopic <b>laser</b> <b>ablations</b> and {{assess the impact of}} IOL decentration and tilt on visual quality. METHODS: An adaptive optics visual simulator was used to simulate the wavefront aberration pattern of 1 aberration-correcting IOL (Acrysof IQ SN 60 WF), 1 aberration-free IOL (Akreos Adapt AO), and 1 spherical IOL (Triplato) under 5 IOL situations: centered, 0. 2 mm and 0. 4 mm decentered, and 2 degrees and 4 degrees tilted in eyes with simulated low or high myopic <b>laser</b> corneal <b>ablations.</b> Monocular distance visual acuity at 100 %, 50 %, and 10 % contrast were measured. RESULTS: Ten eyes of 10 patients were evaluated. When the IOLs were centered, the aberration-correcting IOL provided the best visual quality results in both groups. When the IOLs were misaligned, there was a decrease of visual quality with all simulated IOLs except the aberration-free IOL in the high myopia group. In the misaligned situations, all simulated IOLs obtained comparable visual quality results in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that in patients with previous myopic <b>laser</b> corneal <b>ablation,</b> aberration-correcting IOLs should be implanted. The decrease in visual quality when these IOLs are decentered or tilted demonstrates the importance of accurate implantation of these IOLs. 2. 257 JCR (2012) Q 1, 12 / 59 Ophthalmology, 38 / 199 Surger...|$|R
