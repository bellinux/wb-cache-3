5|$|Apart {{from the}} six crew members, {{a total of}} 160 {{passengers}} were on board {{at the time of}} the crash. Although there were 169 names on the original passenger list, nine did not board the flight. All the bodies were recovered from the wreckage. Karnataka Home Minister V. S. Acharya said eight people were initially reported to have survived, although one person died of his injuries—this was however refuted by an Air India spokesman who confirmed that all initial survivors were alive. This confusion arose after fire fighters rescued a <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>who</b> died on the way to hospital. The airport manager at Mangalore, Peter Abraham confirmed that there were difficulties when trying to reach the plane.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Kinne was {{associated}} with two mysterious deaths. On March 19 of that year, her husband, James Kinne, was found {{shot in the head}} with the couple's two-year-old daughter playing nearby. Sharon Kinne claimed that the <b>little</b> <b>girl,</b> <b>who</b> had often been allowed to play with her father's guns, had accidentally shot him, and police were initially unable to disprove this theory. The case was closed as an accidental death and remained that way until the evening of May 27, when the body of twenty-three-year-old Patricia Jones, a local file clerk, was found by Kinne and a boyfriend in a secluded area. Investigation showed that Jones had been the wife of another of Kinne's boyfriends, and that Jones's husband had tried to break off his affair with Kinne shortly before Patricia Jones went missing. When Kinne admitted to having been the last person to speak to Patricia Jones, she was charged with Jones's death and, upon further investigation of his death, with the murder of James Kinne.|$|E

It features scenes of Ochi in a Western-style prairie, standing in wooden farming structures {{and next to}} a windpump. The music video also features an old man dressed in Western clothing, and a <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>who</b> resembles Ochi. Many scenes depict the old man next to the <b>little</b> <b>girl,</b> <b>who</b> is replaced by the fully-grown Ochi. The man gives some seeds to the <b>little</b> <b>girl,</b> <b>who</b> plants them. In the final scenes of the video, one of the seeds sprout into a red wildflower.|$|E

50|$|The Insect God is {{the only}} book in the {{collection}} with a clear-cut narrative. It follows a <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>who's</b> lured away from her nanny by anthropomorphic insects. The book's instructive quality is in teaching stranger danger: the <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> would not have met with catastrophe from the predatory insects had she not wandered away from her nanny.|$|R
25|$|In Caesar's Daughter, a {{novel by}} Edward Burton, Julia is a {{three-dimensional}} character.

She is dearly beloved by nearly everyone she meets except her stepmother, Livia. Loyal to her father, but not afraid to criticize his decisions she is (after Livia) his favourite consort. Julia grows up among intrigue and ultimately becomes its victim. Despite her tragic fate, Julia remains very cheerful and kind nonetheless.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{worthy of}} note that the Dorothy of the books is only a <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>who</b> is no older than twelve-years-old. However, she is mature and very resourceful, only crying when faced with {{ultimate}} despair, whereas the older Dorothy of the movie (portrayed as a twelve-year-old by sixteen-year-old Judy Garland) spends several portions of the film crying and being told by others what to do, however her fear was overshadowed by the Cowardly Lion's. This is more consistent with Thompson's portrayal of Dorothy—Baum {{is known for his}} strong and independent female characters.|$|E
25|$|Asa's plan is {{to drain}} Katia of her life, believing that this act will grant her immortality.

[...] Finally, Mephisto reveals to the couple that his disguise as the little girl was in fact their future daughter, but she will never exist because of their decision.

[...] An [...] "artistic and creative" [...] streak lead her to attend performing arts college, and attain a degree in drama.

[...] Nadia Mendoza of The Sun described Steph as Hollyoaks [...] "resident drama queen", explaining that Steph's dislike of Summer stemmed from the fact she had previously been the only actress in the village.

[...] Though this was not lost on the reviewer for The New York Dramatic Mirror which stated, [...] "The work of the <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>who</b> plays the leading role in this film is a constant wonder to spectators."

So it is a <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>who</b> tells her mother: I love the nurse". She said in another interview: [...] "But if people prefer to give this song a perverse sense, it is their problem". Thus, she does not confirm the lesbian allusions that seem to emerge from the chorus (the French verb [...] "aimer" [...] can mean either [...] "to love" [...] or [...] "to like"). However, the song has been listed in several books dealing with homosexuality and explains the fact that many gay people were immediately attracted to Farmer's world.|$|E
