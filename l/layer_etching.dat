40|$|Top {{layers of}} railway rails are {{subjected}} to microstructural changes sometimes resulting in white <b>etching</b> <b>layers.</b> These thin layers are more brittle than the base material and show increased cracking and spalling. For the present study pearlitic rail samples from curves without corrugation from the Stockholm local traffic network (SL) have been investigated concerning their influence on the crack initiation and crack propagation into the base material. Samples with white <b>etching</b> <b>layers</b> were subjected to tensile loads. The white <b>etching</b> <b>layers</b> and crack surfaces were examined with light and scanning electron microscope. White <b>etching</b> <b>layers</b> with a thickness of 200 µm were found.

Cracks growing through the white <b>etching</b> <b>layer</b> initiating cracks in the pearlite have been found. Also, the crack sensitivity is higher for the white <b>etching</b> <b>layer</b> as compared to the base material and it creates initiation points for cracks in the pearlitic part of the rail...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{electrochemical}} pore formation in n-InP in KOH. A model for pore growth along the A crystallographic directions was previously developed in our group. It is shown how {{an understanding of}} this model {{can be used to}} explain the main features of a linear sweep voltammogram of InP in KOH. A computational model of A pore growth is demonstrated. It reproduces the experimentally observed cross sections of porous domains and qualitatively reproduces many other features of porous <b>layer</b> <b>etching.</b> The effect of current density on porous <b>layer</b> <b>etching</b> is investigated. It is shown that mass transport through a surface pit is a key factor limiting porous layer thickness. It is also shown that crystallographic pore etching in InP in KOH is most likely a sixelectron process. The effect of temperature and KOH concentration on porous <b>layer</b> <b>etching</b> is also investigated. A current-line oriented pore morphology is observed at low temperatures in both the highest and lowest KOH concentrations in which pore growth is observed. The variation of pore width with both temperature and concentration, as well as the formation of current-line oriented pores is explained in terms of a model of charge transfer at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. Porous layers are also formed in KCl, and these are compared with those formed in KOH. These KCl porous layers grow to much greater thicknesses and the pore walls are crystallographically bounded. It is argued that the premature cessation of porous <b>layer</b> <b>etching</b> in KOH is caused by the formation of an insoluble indium oxide during the etching process. This oxide blocks the passage of reactants to the pore tips. Finally, it is argued that the utility of porous etching in KOH is in its unique ability to elucidate the mechanisms of purely electrochemical porous etching...|$|E

The configuration studied represents a large defect in the rail that was observed from a rail removed from service. These investigation has provided {{a better understanding of}} how a crack initiated from a larger defect grows under the effect of white <b>etching</b> <b>layer.</b> The results highlight that a continuous white <b>etching</b> <b>layer</b> region will dominates the growth of the crack compared to a patches white <b>etching</b> <b>layer</b> region for a smaller crack size while patches of white <b>etching</b> <b>layer</b> will accelerates the crack growth for a larger crack size.

Silicon dioxide {{sacrificial}} <b>layer</b> <b>etching</b> {{has become}} a major surface micromachining method to fabricate microsensors and microactuators often made of polycrystalline silicon.

40|$|The topography, morphology, {{structure}} and residual stress {{state at the}} surface of a rail with severe longitudinal ripples was characterized using a combination of spectrometry, microscopy, scattering and diffraction methods. The investigations reveal that white <b>etching</b> <b>layers</b> develop at the ripple hills, while the ripple valleys contain a severely plastic deformed layer. While the structure in the ripple valleys remains pearlite, the structure of the white <b>etching</b> <b>layers</b> on top of the ripple hills is nanocrystalline martensite containing cementite particles of a few nanometer size. The microhardness of the white <b>etching</b> <b>layers</b> on top of the ripple hills is about three times higher than the microhardness in the ripple valleys. The microhardness throughout the white <b>etching</b> <b>layer</b> is not homogeneous due to the non-uniform amount of carbon in solute solution and also due to differences in the amount {{and the size of the}} fine carbide particles. The whole running surface is under biaxial compressive residual stresses. In the ripple valleys the direction of the principal residual stresses nearly coincides with the longitudinal and the transverse direction on the rail. On the ripple hills the compressive residual stresses due to the martensite formation are significantly higher and the stress state is nearly homogeneous. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V.
