40|$|Spectral {{molecular}} <b>line</b> <b>profile</b> {{observations of}} star-forming molecular clouds sometimes show distinct red asymmetric double-peaked molecular <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> with weaker blue peaks and stronger red peaks. For some star-forming molecular clouds, such molecular transitions with red asymmetric <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> and blue asymmetric <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> (i. e. blue asymmetric double-peaked molecular <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> with weaker red peaks and stronger blue peaks) may coexist in spatially resolved spectral observations, while for others, such molecular transitions with red asymmetric <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> may completely dominate in spatially resolved spectral observations. Blue asymmetric <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> are usually interpreted as signals of central core collapses, while red asymmetric <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> remain unexplained. In this paper, we advance a spherically symmetric self-similar hydrodynamic model framework for envelope expansions with core collapses (EECC) {{of a general}} polytropic molecular gas cloud under self-gravity. Based on such EECC hydrodynamic cloud models, we perform tracer molecular <b>line</b> <b>profile</b> calculations using the publicly available RATRAN code for star-forming clouds with spectroscopic signatures of red asymmetric <b>line</b> <b>profiles.</b> The presence of red asymmetric <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> from molecular cloud cores indicates that EECC processes are most likely an essential hydrodynamic process of star formation. With spatial distributions, we explore various <b>profiles</b> of molecular <b>lines</b> for several tracer molecules in different settings of EECC dynamic models with and without shocks.

40|$|ABSTRACT: X-ray {{diffraction}} (XRD) {{provides a}} lot of information of the micro-structure of the specimen by <b>line</b> <b>profile</b> analysis. It was supposed that the <b>line</b> <b>profile</b> is broadened {{by the size of the}} crystalline, and also broadened by instrument. We proposed recently, (Kejia Liu et al, Adv. in X-ray analysis, 54, 17 （ 2010 ）) that there is still another effect which broadening the <b>line</b> <b>profile,</b> that is, the absorption of the sample. In this work, we shall discuss the dependence of the <b>line</b> <b>profile</b> with the absorption coefficient in detail. We demonstrate the absorption broadening by two crystals with different absorptions, we find that the <b>line</b> <b>profile</b> is strongly affected by the absorption, and the observed XRD patterns are in excellent agreement with the calculated <b>line</b> <b>profile</b> functions.

Here we present a <b>line</b> <b>profile</b> analysis of ǫ Ophiuchi, which is a pulsating red giant. The main differences compared to previous <b>line</b> <b>profile</b> analyses done for heat-driven oscillations are the small amplitudes and the predicted short damping and re-excitation times in red giants.

40|$|Context. Emission and {{absorption}} <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> {{which are}} {{formed in the}} interaction of pre-main sequence (PMS) stars and their circumstellar environment {{are found to be}} variable at various timescales. Aims. We investigate the patterns and timescales of temporal <b>line</b> <b>profile</b> variability in order to explore the dynamical circumstellar environment of the PMS Herbig Ae star V 351 Ori. Methods. We obtained 45 high-resolution (R 28, 000) spectra of V 351 Ori at timescales of hours, days, and months. We analysed the Hα <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> and also examined the Hβ, NaD 1 and NaD 2 <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> to explore the nature of the spectroscopic variability. Results. The Hα <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> showed strong variations over all timescales. The shape of the profiles changed over timescales of a day. Single as well as simultaneous event(s) of blue-shifted and red-shifted transient absorption components (TACs), i. e. signatures of outflow and infall, were also observed in the Hα <b>line</b> <b>profiles.</b> The shortest period of variation in the TACs was < 1 hour. All transient absorption events were found to decelerate with a rate of a few to fractions of m s- 2. The depth and width of the TACs were also changing with time. The presence of elongated red-shifted components at some epochs supports the episodic nature of accretion. Conclusions. Variable emission and absorption components detected in Hα <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> show the dynamic nature of interaction between V 351 Ori and its circumstellar environment. The Hα non-photospheric profiles of the star most probably originate in the disk wind. Episodic accretion of gaseous material at a slow rate and outflow of clumpy gaseous material are still occurring in V 351 Ori at an age of 6. 5 Myr.

40|$|The {{search for}} the onset of star {{formation}} in pre-stellar cores has focussed on the identification of an infall signature in the molecular <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> of tracer species. The classic infall signature is a double peaked <b>line</b> <b>profile</b> with an asymmetry in {{the strength of the}} peaks such that the blue peak is stronger. L 1689 B is a pre-stellar core and infall candidate but new JCMT HCO+ <b>line</b> <b>profile</b> data, presented here, confirms that both blue and red asymmetric <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> are present in this source. Moreover, a dividing line can be drawn between the locations where each type of profile is found. It is argued that {{it is unlikely that the}} <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> can be interpreted with simple models of infall or outflow and that rotation of the inner regions is the most likely explanation. A rotational model is developed in detail with a new 3 D molecular line transport code and it is found that the best type of model is one in which the rotational velocity profile is in between solid body and Keplerian. It is firstly shown that red and blue asymmetric <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> can be generated with a rotation model entirely in the absence of any infall motion. The model is then quantitively compared with the JCMT data and an iteration over a range of parameters is performed to minmize the difference between the data and model.

Aims. We investigate the possibility of determining flare-accelerated non-thermal ion and/or plasma velocity distributions. Methods: We study EUV spectral lines produced during a flare SOL 2013 - 05 - 15 T 01 : 45 using the Hinode EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS). The flare is located close to the eastern solar limb with an extended loop structure, allowing the different flare features: ribbons, hard X-ray (HXR) footpoints and the loop-top source to be clearly observed in UV, EUV and X-rays. EUV line spectroscopy is performed in seven different regions covering the flare. We study the <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> of the isolated and unblended Fe XVI lines (λ 262. 9760 Å) mainly formed at temperatures of ∼ 2 to 4 MK. Suitable Fe XVI <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> at one time close to the peak soft X-ray emission and free of directed mass motions are examined using: 1. a higher moments analysis, 2.

Results: Fe XVI <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> in the flaring loop-top, HXR footpoint and ribbon regions can be confidently fitted with a kappa <b>line</b> <b>profile</b> with an extra variable κ, giving low, non-thermal κ values between 2 and 3. 3.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that <b>line</b> <b>profile</b> distortions are {{commonly}} observed in gravitationally lensed quasar spectra. Often attributed to microlensing differential magnification, <b>line</b> <b>profile</b> distortions can provide information on the geometry and kinematics of the broad emission line region (BLR) in quasars. We investigate the effect of gravitational microlensing on quasar broad emission <b>line</b> <b>profiles</b> and their underlying continuum, combining the emission from simple representative BLR models with generic microlensing magnification maps. Specifically, we considered Keplerian disk, polar, and equatorial wind BLR models of various sizes. The effect of microlensing has been quantified with four observables: μ[SUP]BLR[/SUP], the total magnification of the broad emission line; μ[SUP]cont[/SUP], the magnification of the underlying continuum; as well as red/blue, RBI and wings/core, WCI, indices that characterize the <b>line</b> <b>profile</b> distortions. The simulations showed that distortions of <b>line</b> <b>profiles,</b> such as those recently observed in lensed quasars, can indeed be reproduced and attributed to the differential effect of microlensing on spatially separated regions of the BLR. While the magnification of the emission line μ[SUP]BLR[/SUP] sets an upper limit on the BLR size and, similarly, the magnification of the continuum μ[SUP]cont[/SUP] sets an upper limit {{on the size of the}} continuum source, the <b>line</b> <b>profile</b> distortions mainly depend on the BLR geometry and kinematics. We thus built (WCI,RBI) diagrams that can serve as diagnostic diagrams to discriminate between the various BLR models on the basis of quantitative measurements. It appears that a strong microlensing effect puts important constraints on the size of the BLR and on its distance to the high-magnification caustic. In that case, BLR models with different geometries and kinematics are more prone to produce distinctive <b>line</b> <b>profile</b> distortions for a limited number of caustic configurations, which facilitates their discrimination. When the microlensing effect is weak, there is a larger overlap between the characteristics of the <b>line</b> <b>profile</b> distortions produced by the different models, and constraints can only be derived on a statistical basis.
