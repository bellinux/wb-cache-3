40|$|Phases of the 600 km. deep {{earthquake}} of April 16, 1957, {{which have}} not been reflected at the earth's surface show very sharp beginnings arriving within the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> <b>of</b> a few seconds at the calculated times. However, phases which have been reflected at the surface, for example PP, pP', pPP, have more or less emergent beginnings which arrive between a few seconds {{and as much as}} 30 seconds too early. These emergent beginnings are followed by an impulse which arrives at nearly the calculated time. In agreement with earlier findings, it is concluded that the emergent beginnings of such waves are caused by waves which have been reflected at the Mohorovičić discontinuity or other discontinuities below the surface. Observations of such early emergent arrivals also include waves of the types P'P', PKSP', P'P'P' which have passed twice or more through the mantle and the core. P'P'P'P' has been observed for the first time. The travel times of P'P'P'P' and the coefficient of absorption calculated from P'P'P'P' and P' agree within the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> with the expected values; however, these <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> are so large that the results cannot be used to improve earlier findings.

40|$|A {{study on}} a {{variation}} of bending and compression parallel to the grain strength in Mahogany (Swietenia mahogany) tree has been under taken. The material consisted of 5 trees, each of which was represented by 4 bolt taken respectively from near tree base, at middle half and {{upper end of the}} merchantable bole. The test pieces were then drawn from each bolt following the cruciform pattern of the ASTM D 14362 procedure. Using this pattern, 221 and 197 test specimens were respectively obtained for the bending and compression test. The result shows that the tree averages of the bending strength ranges from 90 - 110 % of the species maan value, the cardinal point averages from 100 - 101 % and the position within tree (bolt) averages from 97 - 102 %, As has been anticipated the tree averages are significantly different in both the bending and compression strengths. Computation of the precision of estimates of the species mean in term of the probable <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> (PLE) as percentage of the species mean within 95 % confidence band as suggested by Pearson (1952) indicates an error of 9, 51 % and 12, 44 % for respectively the bending and compression strength.

If the salt concentration of the medium is low there may result from the Donnan equilibrium a thermodynamic P. D. of considerable magnitude. In the presence of low concentrations of electrolytes, this P. D. is to be regarded as positive in sign at reactions of the medium at which the cataphoretic charge of the cell is negative in sign.

Methods: We studied the 99. 9 % confidence intervals of the means of 24 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) + and HIV- blood samples analyzed by 18 laboratories of the Liguria Region Quality Assessment Program (Liguria Region QALI. Regression equations of lower M) and upper (L 2) confidence limits over the means of data cleared of unusual results were used to interpolate <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> for mean values in the tested range. Results: L 1 and L 2 were symmetric around the mean and a single absolute difference (Abs Res) between the limits and the mean was found. Abs Res significantly increased over mean values (P = 0. 0005 for %CD 4 +, P < 0. 0001 for AbsCD 4 +). Limits were compatible with errors shown with blind replicates. Unacceptable results, outside the limits, accounted for 25 % and 30 % of %CD 4 + and for 18 % and 35 % AbsCD 4 + in the Liguria Region QALI and in the Piemonte Region QA Program, respectively. Limits interpolated over the median showed a similar grading. A comparable fraction of unacceptable data was also found with the method used in the U. K.
