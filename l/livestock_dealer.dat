Carrying capacity and pastoral productivity promoted in state policies, however, are arbitrary concepts. This paper finds the maximizing strategy of indigenous herders more adaptive to the precarious and drought-ridden tropical arid zone, using the Rendille herding as the main example.

50|$|The {{economy of}} the {{municipality}} was based around raising crops and livestock, trading and some industry (grist mills and hammer mills). Some of the residents found jobs in other countries, particularly in Spain. Due to its location, Italian and German-Swiss <b>livestock</b> <b>dealers,</b> held <b>livestock</b> markets in Giubiasco starting in {{the first decades of}} the 16th Century.

5000|$|A few German Jews came in {{the colonial}} era. The largest numbers arrived after 1820, {{especially}} in the mid-19th century. [...] They spread across the North and South (and California, where Levi Strauss arrived in 1853. They formed small German-Jewish communities in cities and towns. They typically were local and regional merchants selling clothing; others were <b>livestock</b> <b>dealers,</b> agricultural commodity traders, bankers, and operators of local businesses. Henry Lehman, who founded Lehman Brothers in Alabama, was a particularly prominent {{example of such a}} German-Jewish immigrant. They formed Reform synagogues and sponsored numerous local and national philanthropic organizations, such as B'nai B'rith. This German-speaking group is quite distinct from the Yiddish-speaking East-European Jews who arrived in much larger numbers starting in the late 19th century and concentrated in New York.|$|R
50|$|The {{brothers}} {{were born in}} the village of Avdella near the town of Gerebena (modern Grevena, Greece), in the Ottoman Empire. Milton Manaki was born in 1882 and Yanaki was born in 1878 into a wealthy Aromanian family of land owners. Their parents were well-off <b>livestock</b> <b>dealers</b> and lenders. In the 1860s, the area became a center of the Romanian national movement among the Aromanians, in which their father Dimitrios was involved, and to some extent the brothers developed a sense of Aromanian identity. They both attended Romanian elementary school in their birthplace. After that, Milton studied at the Romanian high school in Yanya (modern Ioannina) and Yanaki at the Romanian high school in Manastir. Yanaki showed great signs of interest for painting, calligraphy, and photography during his high school years. Milton, not engaged by school, {{dropped out of high school}} after completing his first year. His parents then sent him to Gerebena to learn a craft, but he left that and returned home, where he was supported by his parents. Having a high school education, Yanaki worked as a teacher.|$|R
5000|$|However, the Jewish {{residents}} were only {{allowed to enter}} a few professions, such as trade, particularly as <b>livestock</b> <b>dealers</b> and so on. Houses were built with two separate entrances, one for Jews and one for Christians. They were under {{the high and low}} courts of the Baden bailiff. In general, the Jewish population was fairly well tolerated (except for the Zwetschgenkrieg or [...] "plum war"), self-managed and maintained its own school. In March 1798 the French revolutionary troops overturned the Swiss regime and proclaimed the Helvetic Republic; the Surb region now belonged to the short-lived Canton of Baden from 1798 to 1803. The new state was soon hated in large parts of the population. This hatred erupted on 21 September 1802 during the so-called Zwetschgenkrieg against the Jewish fellow citizens, who were considered supporters of the new liberal government. A horde of over 800 residents from neighboring villages fell over Endingen and Lengnau, and enriched themselved at the belongings of those defenseless Jews, while the Christian inhabitants were largely unmolested.|$|R

5000|$|Several {{families}} were already {{living in the}} area when the town was {{laid out on the}} T Fork Ranch between 1886 and 1890. In 1890 the Wichita Valley Railway Company established a line between Wichita Falls and Seymour and constructed a three-story hotel at the station the railroad's president is said to have named for Dundee, Scotland. That year Amanda Giddens built the first post office and became postmistress. A school had begun by 1891, and in 1892 the town was described as a post office and station on the railway with a population of twenty-five. The railroad brought in more settlers. By 1896 the population was estimated at 199, and Dundee had two <b>livestock</b> <b>dealers,</b> a clothier, a general store, a hardware store, a seller of notions, and a Mr. Biffle who sold organs. The Methodists and Presbyterians organized in the late 1890s, and the Baptists in the early 1900s. Dundee prospered and became for a time the second largest town in Archer County. In 1909 a bank was established with Alex Albright as president. Albright later became well known as the owner of [...] "probably the largest Karakul sheep ranch in the world," [...] just outside Dundee.|$|R

Cows are purchased from a <b>livestock</b> <b>dealer</b> in town, as {{is at least one}} chicken. Additional chickens can be hatched by placing an egg in an incubator instead of selling it. Cows can be bred by purchasing a Miracle Potion from the <b>livestock</b> <b>dealer,</b> which will make a cow pregnant, giving birth after 21 days to a newborn calf that is smaller than purchased calves. However, due to the cost of the potion and the lost productivity, it is more efficient to buy calves.

Fully developed chickens and cows can be sold for profit.|$|E

500|$|After the 1997 provincial election, Klein {{appointed}} Stelmach Minister of Agriculture, Food, and Rural development. While he {{held this}} office, his department encouraged {{the establishment of}} feedlots. The opposition parties charged {{that the government was}} not regulating these sufficiently, but Stelmach responded that municipalities had the authority necessary to effectively regulate them. On the Canadian Wheat Board controversy, Stelmach sided with farmers who wanted an end to the federal body's monopoly on grain sales in the western provinces. Legislatively, Stelmach sponsored five bills while in the Agriculture, Food, and Rural Development portfolio, all of which passed through the legislature. [...] 1997's Meat Inspection Amendment Act required meat inspectors to acquire a search warrant before entering a private dwelling, but also allowed for fines to be voluntarily paid without requiring a court case. It was called by Liberal agriculture critic Ken Nicol [...] "a really good bill". The Livestock and Livestock Products Amendment Act of the same year eliminated government guarantee of the Livestock Patrons' Assurance Fund, designed to protect cattle producers from payment defaults by <b>livestock</b> <b>dealers,</b> in favour of leaving the Fund entirely {{in the hands of the}} industry. It too was supported by the Liberals, with Nicol calling it [...] "very easy for us to accept". [...] In 1998, Stelmach sponsored the Agriculture Statutes (Penalties) Amendment Act, which overhauled the penalty system for violation of various agricultural statutes, setting maximum fines and leaving the precise amount up to judges on a case by case basis. It also passed with Liberal support, as MLA Ed Gibbons said that it [...] "really makes a lot of sense". Another 1998 bill was the Marketing of Agricultural Products Amendment Act, which allowed provincial agricultural marketing boards to revise their marketing plans, and was supported by the opposition. [...] Finally, Stelmach initiated the Agriculture Statutes (Livestock Identification) Amendment Act, which allowed the government to delegate the inspection of branding to the cattle industry. The bill was the subject of considerable debate on second reading, but was ultimately supported by the Liberals on the third and final reading.|$|R
50|$|The Oberstreiter-Markt - {{despite its}} name, {{actually}} a fair - is held {{each year on}} the second weekend in September, and is widely known. The Oberstreiter-Markt had its first documentary mention in 1570. Then standing at {{what is now the}} graveyard was a chapel consecrated to Saint Bartholomew. Electoral Palatinate established a market here so that inhabitants of the Amt of Böckelheim could buy all kinds of useful articles. Also tied in with this event were folk plays and merrymaking in the form of dancing. The market could only be opened once an officer, leading a squad of soldiers, had tasted the wine to be given out at the event and deemed it to be the genuine article. As early as the 17th century, the hustle and bustle at the Oberstreiter-Markt had got so far out of hand, thereby rousing God in heaven to wrath and retribution that the Oberamtmann of Böckelheim felt constrained to impose a strict ban. On 24 August 1687, Oberamtmann Pawal von Ramlingen issued an order that anybody caught at the Oberstreiter-Markt dancing, gorging himself, guzzling wine or taking part in a brawl would either be locked up in the tower for eight days or have to pay a fine of 10 Rhenish guilders. It was no use, though. Even though the weather was bad, ten thousand visitors attended the market that year. In 1772, there was a murder at the market. The man who was killed was an Electoral Palatinate soldier, and his death was the culmination of an argument between some Electoral Palatinate people and some others representing the House of Salm. In 1787, the notorious outlaw Schinderhannes (or Johannes Bückler, to use his true name) showed up at the market to cause trouble. He and his gang did no Oberstreiter any harm, only striking some French soldiers who had come from the Sponheim domain to Oberstreit to dance. These incidents are without a doubt traceable to the fiery Oberstreit wine. As late as the 1940s, the Oberstreiter-Markt was still one of the biggest folk festivals on the Middle Nahe. There were always several marquees, and {{on the last day of}} the market, a livestock market was held attended by the farmers and <b>livestock</b> <b>dealers</b> from throughout the surrounding area. The fair is not quite as grand now, but it is still held.|$|R
5000|$|As {{early as}} the Middle Ages, there were Jews living in Sobernheim, with the first mention of them coming from 1301. During the {{persecution}} {{in the time of}} the Plague in 1348 and 1349, Jews were murdered here, too. In 1357, Archbishop Gerlach of Mainz took two Jews into his protection and allowed them to settle in either Bingen or Sobernheim. Jews were mentioned as being in the town once again in 1384. In the earlier half of the 15th century, there were four or five Jewish families. These families earned their livelihoods at moneylending. In 1418, four Jewish families each paid 10 Rhenish guilders, a woman 4 guilders and three poor Jews 4 guilders in yearly tax to the Mainz stewardship or the Empire. In 1429, all the Jews at Sobernheim (named were Hirtz, Gomprecht, Smohel, Mayer, Smohel’s mother and others), together with those throughout the Archbishopric of Mainz, were taken prisoner. It is not believed that this resulted in banishment. Nonetheless, there were clearly no Jews living in Sobernheim in the mid 16th century. The founding of the modern Jewish community came sometime in the 16th or 17th century. Then living in the town were up to five families with all together 20 to 30 persons. After the French Revolution, the community grew from 64 persons in 1808 to a peak of 135 persons in 1895. Beginning in the late 19th century, though, the number of Jews in the town shrank as some either moved away or emigrated. Among Sobernheim’s Jews in the 19th and 20th centuries were <b>livestock</b> <b>dealers,</b> butchers, textile sellers, farm product sellers, shoemakers, leather dealers, shop owners and stocking manufacturers. Of particular importance in this last field of business was the Marum stocking factory. In the way of institutions, there were a synagogue (see Synagogue below), a Jewish elementary and religious school with a teacher’s dwelling at the house at Marumstraße 20 (this house had been donated after the synagogue’s consecration in 1859 by Isaac Werner as a school building), a mikveh (while a supposedly mediaeval one was also unearthed at the house at Großstraße 53 in 1996) and a graveyard (see Jewish graveyard below). To provide for the community’s religious needs, an elementary schoolteacher (but later only a religion teacher) was hired, who also busied himself as the hazzan and, although this is not known for sure, as the shochet. Preserved is a whole series of job advertisements for such a position in Sobernheim from such publications as the Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums. This one appeared in that newspaper on 1 August 1853:The local Jewish community seeks for 1 September of this year an efficient elementary teacher and cantor. He must be a native, receives 160 Thaler as salary along with free dwelling and heating. Interested parties please announce themselves as soon as possible, and include a copy of their examination and service records. Sobernheim in Rhenish Prussia. School board J. Werner, J. Klein. The successful applicant for this job was Alexander Cahn, who then worked in Sobernheim for several decades and was the figure who characterized Sobernheim’s Jewish community life {{in the latter half of}} the 19th century. He also established a successful Jewish boarding school for boys in the town. Beginning in 1890, schoolteacher Simon Berendt was active in the community. With him, the community celebrated the synagogue’s reconsecration in 1904. He celebrated his own 25 years of service in Sobernheim in 1915.
