40|$|Chlorhexidine {{gluconate}} (CHX) has a bactericidal {{effect to}} Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) which causes periodontal disease. Therefore the controlled loading and release of CHX from multilayer thin film is beneficial {{for the local}} treatment of periodontitis. This study used ten bilayers of PDADMAC/PSSMA and PDADMAC/AL and loaded CHX into each film. Both un-loaded and <b>loaded</b> thin <b>films</b> were analysed using UV-Vis spectroscopy and AFM. The <b>loaded</b> <b>film</b> was thicker and rougher than the un-loaded film for both PDADMAC/PSSMA and PDADMAC/AL <b>film.</b> The <b>loaded</b> <b>films</b> were released in H 2 O 2 for 24 h, and UV-Vis spectroscopy was measured and compared with the standard calibration curve of CHX. Results indicated that PDADMAC/PSSMA released 0. 00052 M and PDADMAC/AL released 0. 00071 M respectively. Both the <b>loaded</b> <b>films</b> were tested for toxicity to Aa. Neither film killed all colonies of Aa, however they reduced colony growth by 99 % compared to the blank condition...|$|R
40|$|Tetracycline, an {{antibiotic}} used against {{a broad range}} of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria was encapsulated in microspheres made of poly(3 -hydroxybutyric acid) P(3 HB), a microbial biodegradable polymer isolated from Bacillus cereus SPV. The drug loaded microspheres were prepared using an oil emulsion technique and compressed uniaxially to produce films. Although the same fabrication conditions were used for preparing the drug loaded and unloaded microspheres, the presence of the drug changed the surface morphology and roughness of the films. The surface morphology of the drug <b>loaded</b> <b>films</b> appeared uneven and coarser and the roughness, with an average root mean square value of 5. 89 ?µm, was significantly higher than that of the unloaded film. The in vitro biocompatibility of the films was investigated using a human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) by comparing cell viability on the films to that on conventional tissue culture plastics. Both films appear to support cell growth but cell attachment and percentage cell viability were greater on the drug <b>loaded</b> <b>films</b> (32 % of control) compared to the unloaded film (10 % of control), possibly {{as a result of the}} non-uniform surface morphology and increased roughness of the drug <b>loaded</b> <b>film.</b> Thus, the above results illustrate that the drug <b>loaded</b> <b>films,</b> in addition to being a suitable matrix for drug delivery, represent an improved substrate for keratinocyte cell attachment...|$|R

40|$|Natural {{polymers}} {{are used}} as compounds for the designing of drugs {{in the treatment of}} different ailments. Chitosan and silver nanoparticle have proven wound healing properties individually. As both have wound healing property, the combination of these two may show improvement in wound healing activity. Thus, the composite were evaluated for various in vitro evaluation tests to ascertain the applicability of prepared combination for wound healing activity. These films were evaluated for water absorption capacity, antibacterial activity, tensile strength and in vivo wound healing studies by excision wound model using albino rats. The drug <b>loaded</b> <b>films</b> have shown significant difference in water absorption capacity and antibacterial activity when compared to optimized blank composite film. There {{was no significant difference in}} tensile strength of drug <b>loaded</b> <b>films</b> when compared to blank composite films. Percentage of wound contraction was better for wounds treated with gentamycin <b>loaded</b> composite <b>film</b> than blank composite film.

The flexible nanocomposite films based on PVDF and surface modified MWCNTs were fabricated via solution casting method. The current voltage characteristics suggests that –COOH and –OH functionalize MWCNT <b>loading</b> PVDF <b>films</b> are semiconducting in nature whereas raw MWCNT and –NH 2 functionalize MWNCT <b>loading</b> PVDF <b>films</b> are comparatively conducting in nature. Experimental data of current density-electric field were fitted with different existing theoretical models.

From ferroelectric study the energy density of –COOH, -OH <b>loaded</b> PVDF <b>films</b> are doubled and tripled compare to the pure PVDF film.

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study is to develop {{polymeric}} matrix <b>films</b> <b>loaded</b> with a combination of free diclofenac sodium (DFSfree) and DFS:Ion exchange resin complexes (DFS:IR) for immediate and sustained release profiles, respectively. Effect of ratio of DFS and IR on the DFS:IR complexation efficiency was studied using batch processing. DFS:IR complex, DFSfree, or a combination of DFSfree+DFS:IR <b>loaded</b> matrix <b>films</b> were prepared by melt-cast technology. DFS content was 20 % w/w in these matrix films. In vitro transcorneal permeability from the film formulations were compared against DFS solution, using a side-by-side diffusion apparatus, over a 6 h period. Ocular disposition of DFS from the solution, films and corresponding suspensions were evaluated in conscious New Zealand albino rabbits, 4 h and 8 h post-topical administration. All in vivo studies were carried out as per the University of Mississippi IACUC approved protocol. Complexation efficiency of DFS:IR was found to be 99 % with a 1 : 1 ratio of DFS:IR. DFS release from DFS:IR suspension and the film were best-fit to a Higuchi model. In vitro transcorneal flux with the DFSfree+DFS:IR(1 : 1) (1 + 1) was twice that of only DFS:IR(1 : 1) film. In vivo, DFS solution and DFS:IR(1 : 1) suspension formulations were not able to maintain therapeutic DFS levels in the aqueous humor (AH). Both DFSfree and DFSfree+DFS:IR(1 : 1) (3 + 1) <b>loaded</b> matrix <b>films</b> were able to achieve and maintain high DFS concentrations in the AH, but elimination of DFS from the ocular tissues was much faster with the DFSfree formulation.
