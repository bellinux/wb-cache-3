5|$|His tent {{is portrayed}} as a less dark place than the {{emptiness}} outside, and becomes a place of safety and sanctuary. Conversely, the swamp is described in themes that convey it as shrouded in mist at night, and a place Nick deliberately tries not to think about. When he wakes in the morning, regenerated by sleep, he feels stronger and the swamp seems <b>less</b> <b>threatening.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the end, the Alsos Mission contributed {{little to}} the Allied defeat of Nazi Germany, because the German nuclear and {{biological}} weapons programs {{that it had been}} formed to investigate turned out to be smaller and <b>less</b> <b>threatening</b> than had been feared. In the field of nuclear weapons development at least, the underfunded and disorganized German program lagged far behind the Allies' own efforts. In its appropriation of the accomplishments of European science, the Alsos Mission played a small part in the wartime and subsequent scientific and technological developments that characterized and transformed the postwar world.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises {{are highly}} {{affected}} by bycatch. Many porpoises, mainly the vaquita, {{are subject to}} great mortality due to gillnetting. Although it is the world's most endangered marine cetacean, the vaquita continues {{to be caught in}} small-mesh gillnet fisheries throughout much of its range. Incidental mortality caused by the fleet of El Golfo de Santa Clara was estimated to be at around 39 vaquitas per year, which is over 17% of the population size. Harbour porpoises also suffer drowning by gillnetting, but on a <b>less</b> <b>threatening</b> scale due to their high population; their mortality rate per year increases a mere 5% due to this.|$|E

25|$|Perfoliate {{pondweed}} is <b>less</b> <b>threatened</b> {{than other}} broadleaved pondweeds, {{but it is}} listed as Vulnerable in Spain and the Netherlands and Endangered in Flanders. There are ongoing efforts to restore populations in Chesapeake Bay, where this was formerly a co-dominant species.|$|R
5|$|The {{reasons for}} the {{disguise}} are unknown. Hingley notes that many contemporary publications attempted to suggest women had {{played a role in}} their creation, perhaps to make them sound <b>less</b> <b>threatening.</b> He suggests that anonymity might have been necessary to protect Bloxam's position at Rugby, but notes Rugby was quite progressive, which makes this unlikely; and, finally, suggests modesty as a possibility. Ian Ridpath, noting the plagiarism of the art from A Celestial Atlas, suggests that this alone might be sufficient to cause the author to wish to remain anonymous.|$|E
5|$|In 1187 Walter, {{along with}} Glanvill and King Henry II, {{attempted}} to mediate a {{dispute between the}} Archbishop of Canterbury, Baldwin of Forde, and the monks of the cathedral chapter. Their efforts were fruitless, and Walter was later drawn back into the dispute, in early 1189 and again as archbishop. The dispute centred on the attempt by Baldwin to build a church dedicated to Saint Thomas Becket, just outside the town of Canterbury. The plan was to staff the church with canons instead of monks, which the monks of Canterbury's cathedral chapter feared {{was an attempt to}} take away the cathedral chapter's right to elect the archbishop. The attempt in 1189 was settled by Baldwin giving up the site near Canterbury for one further away at Lambeth, which was <b>less</b> <b>threatening</b> to the monks.|$|E
5|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} suggests that self-control is akin to a muscle that can be strengthened through practice. In other words, self-control abilities are malleable, a fact that can be a source of hope for those who struggle with this skill. In psychotherapy, treatment for impulse-control issues often involves teaching individuals to realize the downsides of acting on immediate urges and in turn to practice delaying gratification. In anxiety disorders, this process occurs through exposure to a feared situation – which is very uncomfortable at first, but eventually becomes tolerable and even trains a person's mind and body that these situations are <b>less</b> <b>threatening</b> than originally feared. Exposure therapy is only effective if an individual can delay gratification and resist the urge to escape the situation early on. To shed insight on the tradeoff between short- and long-term gains, therapists might also help individuals construct a pro-con list of a certain behavior, with sections for short-term and long-term outcomes. For maladaptive coping behaviors such as self-injury, substance use or avoidance, there are generally no long-term pros. Meanwhile, abstinence from acting on a harmful urge (i.e., delayed gratification) generally results in long-term benefits. This realization can be a powerful impetus for change.|$|E
50|$|A {{student is}} {{described}} as task-involved when he {{is interested in the}} task for its own qualities. This is associated with higher intrinsic motivation. Task-involved students are <b>less</b> <b>threatened</b> by failure because their own ego is not tied up in the success of the task.|$|R
50|$|The Guianan {{piedmont}} and lowland moist forests (NT0182) is an ecoregion in {{the south}} of Venezuela and the north of Brazil. It is in the Amazon biome.The ecoregion is relatively intact, largely protected by conservation units or indigenous territories, and <b>less</b> <b>threatened</b> by global warming than flatter and more deforested regions.|$|R
50|$|Unlike most {{indigenous}} {{languages in}} the US, Zuni is still spoken {{by a significant}} number of children and, thus, is comparatively <b>less</b> <b>threatened</b> with language endangerment. Edmund Ladd reported in 1994 that Zuni is still the main language of communication in the pueblo and is used in the home (Newman 1996).|$|R

25|$|Esther's {{background}} facilitated {{contact with}} the British and made the Ursulines seem <b>less</b> <b>threatening.</b> The convent was a popular target of criticism, representing France, Catholicism and women in power, and the Ursulines feared that the British might close the convent. Nevertheless, it had frequent contact with and visits from the community. The Mother Superior's threefold British, French and Indigenous ties made her a strong political symbol, {{and it was in}} English interest to claim her as one of their own.|$|E
50|$|While both {{species are}} listed as near {{threatened}} in the 2008 IUCN Red List, recent evidence suggests they are <b>less</b> <b>threatened</b> than previously believed, and the populations of both actually appear to have increased, at least locally. Consequently, they will be listed as least concern on the 2009 Red List.|$|R

5000|$|It is said Jews did not {{rank among}} the [...] "economic elite of many British cities" [...] in the 19th century. Again, the {{significance}} in this is that British Protestants and non-Jews felt <b>less</b> <b>threatened</b> by Jews {{because they were not}} imposing on their prosperity and were not responsible for the economic achievements of their nation.|$|R
25|$|Butler {{argues that}} the {{performance}} of gender itself creates gender. Additionally, she compares the performativity of gender {{to the performance of}} the theater. She brings many similarities, including the idea of each individual functioning as an actor of their gender. However she also brings into light a critical difference between gender performance in reality and theater performances. She explains how the theater is much <b>less</b> <b>threatening</b> and does not produce the same fear that gender performances often encounter {{because of the fact that}} there is a clear distinction from reality within the theater.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, {{telecommunication}} and high technology industries employed many New Yorkers. New York City was especially successful at this transition. Entrepreneurs created many small companies, as industrial {{firms such as}} Polaroid withered. This success drew many young professionals into the stilldwindling cities. New York City was the exception and has continued to draw new residents. The energy of the city created attractions and new businesses. Some people believe that changes in policing created a <b>less</b> <b>threatening</b> environment; crime rates dropped, and urban development reduced urban decay.|$|E
25|$|That project {{endeavors to}} present all the {{phenomena}} in society that are perceived negatively by groups transcending national frontiers. Those phenomena constitute {{a challenge to}} creative remedial action. Groups are strongly motivated by the problems that infringe their values and arouse their indignation. As such, problems are a major stimulus driving the development of society. Although there is agreement that problems are numerous and that many are really serious, little effort {{has been made to}} determine how many problems there are. Likewise, while it is becoming increasingly evident that problems interact with one another, and constitute complex networks or systems, little effort has been made to map that complexity. The perceptions documented in that project raise useful questions concerning the nature and existence of problems, especially when other groups consider that one perception or another is irrelevant, misleading or misinformed. An aim of that research area, then, is to assemble information whose significance is collectively repressed, displaced onto some <b>less</b> <b>threatening</b> problems, or projected in the form of blame onto some other social group.|$|E
50|$|Desert {{bighorn sheep}} (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) {{are found in}} the area, mostly above 7000', and they lamb in the area. Their {{population}} is <b>less</b> <b>threatened</b> than those of other subspecies in California. Unlike animals of this subspecies in the Mojave Desert, those in the San Gabriel Mountains cannot be legally hunted and need not compete with aggressive feral burros for food or water.|$|R
50|$|It is {{threatened}} by habitat loss, introduced predators and avian malaria. Some populations, however, appear to have developed a level of resistance to avian malaria, which might explain its recent expansion into lowland areas where mosquitoes - the vector of this disease - are more common. Overall, it appears far <b>less</b> <b>threatened</b> than several other Hawaiian honeycreeper, as also reflected by its status as vulnerable.|$|R
50|$|The narrow canyon's {{geography}} {{gives it}} a significantly different microclimate, cooler and more moist, than most other areas of Los Angeles. Coastal fog is common year-round, winter lows rarely drop below 35°F, and summer highs rarely exceed 80°F. Due to its moister climate, and being surrounded by more dense suburban development, the canyon is <b>less</b> <b>threatened</b> by wildfires than other Santa Monica Mountains adjacent communities.|$|R
25|$|The Legislature dutifully {{complied}} with the court's recommendation and carved Presidio County into several new ones including Jeff Davis in 1887. The newly created counties, however, were immediately saddled with their pro rata share of their parent county's debt. Furthermore, Presidio County insisted that the new counties were responsible for paying for {{their share of the}} debt on its new Presidio County Courthouse. To add insult to injury, the new Jeff Davis County found the Fort Davis courthouse, which had sat dormant for two years since the removal of the previous county seat to Marfa, to be a shell of its former self with the building's fixtures and furniture also carried off along with its former official records. The courthouse retained its iron jail cells, but remained as inadequately small and in need of reparation as it had before. By 1910, the need for a new courthouse had become eminent. Numerous repairs, including repeated patching of the roof, had been regularly necessary. Two windows, heavily barred, had been added to the west wall of the upper cell housing women and <b>less</b> <b>threatening</b> prisoners for light and ventilation. Eventually jail facilities became so intolerable that all prisoners required transport to the Presidio County jail for detention, and the building as a whole was seen as being beyond further repair. After completion of construction on the replacement courthouse and the new separate jail building in 1911, the steel cell from the original courthouse was salvaged for use in the new jail, while dirt from the demolition of the old adobe courthouse was used for leveling the grounds of the new courthouse and jail yard.|$|E
500|$|The {{storm surge}} {{produced}} higher than usual tides in along the Patuxent, Potomac, and Anacostia River coastlines. Much of the shoreline of Prince George's County possessed adequate rise of terrain to prevent significant flooding, though the high waters closed three roads where the shoreline was not high enough. The {{passage of the}} hurricane created about 5,000tons (4,500t) of debris to be removed. Fifteen buildings sustained major damage, with another 53buildings affected to some degree. Nearly 200,000 residents in the county lost power. When two of the largest sewage treatment plants in the state lost power, [...] of hazardous sewage overflowed to mix with storm water into two waterways in the county. The wastewater combined with rainwater, making it <b>less</b> <b>threatening.</b> No humans or animals were known to have become sick due to the overflows.|$|E
500|$|Heroes Never Die, an Overwatch-specific news site, {{wrote that}} Doomfist's style was wholly {{unlike that of}} the other characters, and created a [...] "feast or famine" [...] {{scenario}} in which the character is only helpful when engaged in risky, aggressive play. The site expected Doomfist's release to affect team character selections to maximize Doomfist's strengths, weaknesses, and synergies. PC Gamer praised Doomfist's balance against the other characters just prior to his launch. Professional players complimented the addition of a strong, counterable character to disrupt the common, uncounterable characters normally played in the professional circuit. Another commended the idea of fighting game-style combos in a first-person shooter for adding an additional skill ceiling for players to pursue. Kotaku, however, considered Doomfist a better fit for a Marvel vs. Capcom fighting game than Overwatch, and bemoaned the character's vulnerability to snipers, low health, and lack of escape options, which made him <b>less</b> <b>threatening</b> or even unrewarding. Even as Doomfist's design was neat, Waypoint critic thought, the character was not exciting or enough of an extrinsic motivator to reclaim players who had dropped out from its player base. Other reviewers, however, found simple joy in pulling off punches and combos.|$|E
30|$|There was a {{great deal}} of interrelatedness across the strategies. For example, “walking around the room” was not only a {{strategy}} in itself but was pivotal in facilitating other strategies such as inviting questions, approaching non-participants, or assuming an encouraging demeanor. By creating physical proximity, instructors created opportunities for different kinds of interactions with students. As a result, students felt <b>less</b> <b>threatened</b> and more inclined to ask questions or participate in the activities, as noted by Samantha.|$|R
50|$|Less than 15 {{sites of}} S. alabamensis subsp. alabamensis remain due to habitat loss, {{drainage}} and poaching. It is {{listed on the}} US Endangered Species Act as well as Appendix I of the CITES appendix. Because of these there are major restrictions on selling plants across state lines in the USA, and trading internationally. S. alabamensis subsp. wherryi is <b>less</b> <b>threatened</b> due to its wider distribution but is still listed on Appendix II of the CITES appendix.|$|R
5000|$|The {{tropical}} forests where this flying squirrel lives are under threat from timber extraction and {{the conversion of}} the land to agricultural use. However the forests are much <b>less</b> <b>threatened</b> than are similar forests in western Africa. This squirrel is also under threat from hunting for bushmeat, but this is unlikely to pose much of a threat, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|R
2500|$|Displacement: defence {{mechanism}} that shifts sexual or aggressive impulses {{to a more}} acceptable or <b>less</b> <b>threatening</b> target; redirecting emotion to a safer outlet; separation of emotion from its real object and redirection of the intense emotion toward someone or something that is less offensive or threatening {{in order to avoid}} dealing directly with what is frightening or threatening. [...] For example, a mother may yell at her child because she is angry with her husband.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, {{disputes}} between {{the players and}} management in Australia meant that six leading Australian players refused to tour (including the captain, Clem Hill, and Victor Trumper, neither of whom played for Australia again), weakening a side that had otherwise been level with England in recent Ashes series. [...] The leg spin and googly bowlers in the South African side were very effective on the matting pitches then in use in South Africa, but were <b>less</b> <b>threatening</b> on English grass pitches. [...] As a result, England dominated, winning four of their six matches and drawing the other two.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{studies have}} {{analyzed}} the changing attitudes about sex that American adolescents have outside marriage. [...] Adolescents {{were asked how}} they felt about oral and vaginal sex in relation to their health, social, and emotional well-being. [...] Overall, teenagers felt that oral sex was viewed as more socially positive amongst their demographic. Results stated that teenagers believed that oral sex for dating and non-dating adolescents was <b>less</b> <b>threatening</b> to their overall values and beliefs than vaginal sex was. When asked, teenagers who participated in the research viewed oral sex as more acceptable to their peers, and their personal values than vaginal sex.|$|E

Helix pomatia is {{threatened}} by continuous habitat destructions and drainage, usually <b>less</b> <b>threatened</b> by commercial collections. Many unsuccessful {{attempts have been made}} to establish the species in various parts of England, Scotland and Ireland; it only survived in natural habitats in southern England, and is threatened by intensive farming and habitat destruction. It is of lower concern in Switzerland and Austria, but many regions restrict commercial collecting.|$|R
50|$|The Right Bank was {{fortified}} from 1190 to 1209 and the Left Bank from 1200 to 1215. The {{difference in}} completion dates was probably strategic. The Duchy of Normandy {{was in the}} hands of the English Plantagenet dynasty so an attack would most likely come from the northwest. Philip Augustus decided to build the fortress of the Louvre castle to strengthen the defence of the city from attack from the Seine. The Left Bank was less urbanized and <b>less</b> <b>threatened</b> and thus considered less of a priority.|$|R
