40|$|In {{this paper}} we report a new PNP Surface Accumulation Layer Transistor (SALTran) on SOI which uses {{the concept of}} surface {{accumulation}} of holes near the emitter contact to significantly improve the current gain. Using two-dimensional simulation, we have evaluated {{the performance of the}} proposed device in detail by comparing its characteristics with those of the previously published conventional PNP <b>lateral</b> <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistor</b> (LBT) structure. From our simulation results it is observed that depending on the choice of the emitter doping and the emitter length, the proposed SALTran exhibits a current gain enhancement of around 20 times that of the compatible <b>lateral</b> <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistor</b> without deteriorating the cut-off frequency.

40|$|Abstract-The on-chip n-type MOSFET {{current mirror}} circuit with {{different}} drawn gate widths and lengths has been fabricated, {{and has been}} characterized across the wafer with back gate slightly forward biased. The weakly inverted MOSFET device with a small back-gate forward bias represents equivalently the high-gain gated <b>lateral</b> <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistor</b> in low-level injection. Experimental results have exhibited a substantial improvement in the match of the drain current in weak inversion due to action of the gated <b>lateral</b> <b>bipolar</b> <b>transistor,</b> especially €or the small size devices. The extensively measured mismatch of the weak inversion drain current has been successfully reproduced by an analytic statistical model with back-gate forward bias and device size both as input parameters. The experimentally extracted variations in process parameters such as the flat-band voltage and the body effect coefficient each {{have been found to}} follow the inverse square root of the device area. The mismatch model thus can serve as a quantitative design tool, and has been used to optimize the trade-off between the device area and the match with the forward back-gate bias as a parameter.
