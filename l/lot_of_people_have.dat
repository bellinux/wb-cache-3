500|$|Jeremy Medina of Entertainment Weekly said he {{believed}} although the show initially needed improvement, that it had arrived at a [...] "settled and focused" [...] series with [...] "The Banquet". He praised the episode as a whole, {{as well as individual}} small moments, like Leslie's haircut, April calling her [...] "sir", Ron's affinity for bacon-wrapped shrimp, Tom's coining of the phrase [...] "peacockin" [...] to mean standing out in bars. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said [...] "The Banquet" [...] was funnier than other recent Parks and Recreation episodes, although he said the Leslie character continues to too closely resemble a female Michael Scott, the protagonist of The Office. Sepinwall said of the show, [...] "I know a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> already given up, but I really feel like the show is a summer's worth of tweaking away from being good.

500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give you a good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over.

500|$|The {{persistence}} of such attitudes {{was fueled by}} resentment {{over the fact that}} Presley, whose musical and visual performance idiom owed much to African American sources, achieved the cultural acknowledgement and commercial success largely denied his black peers. Into the 21st century, the notion that Presley had [...] "stolen" [...] black music still found adherents. Notable among African American entertainers expressly rejecting this view was Jackie Wilson, who argued, [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> accused Elvis of stealing the black man's music, when in fact, almost every black solo entertainer copied his stage mannerisms from Elvis." [...] And throughout his career, Presley plainly acknowledged his debt.

500|$|The plot of Man of Steel {{employs a}} {{nonlinear}} narrative, and tells {{parts of the}} story in flashback. During story discussions for The Dark Knight Rises in 2008, David S. Goyer told Christopher Nolan his idea regarding how to present Superman in a modern context. Impressed with Goyer's concept, Nolan pitched the idea to the studio, who hired Nolan to produce and Goyer to write based on the financial and critical success of The Dark Knight. Nolan admired Bryan Singer's work on Superman Returns for its connection to Richard Donner's version, stating that [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> approached Superman {{in a lot of}} different ways. I only know the way that has worked for us that's what I know how to do," [...] emphasizing the idea that Batman exists in a world where he is the only superhero and a similar approach to the Man of Steel would assure the integrity needed for the film. [...] "Each serves to the internal logic of the story. They have nothing to do with each other." [...] Nolan, however, clarified that the new film would not have any relationship with the previous film series.|$|E

500|$|... "Harvest Festival" [...] was {{the first}} episode of the season written and {{produced}} separately from the second season. The previous six episodes from the third season were filmed almost immediately after the second season ended {{as part of an}} early shooting schedule to accommodate Poehler's pregnancy. Series co-creator Michael Schur described it as a particularly empowering episode for the Leslie Knope character: [...] "When you see this episode [...] it makes you love her even more. This episode is about Leslie being noticed for the incredible hard work she does." [...] Schur also said he believed the subplot with April and Andy was one that several young people in their situation have faced in real life: [...] "Andy is put into a situation that a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> been put into in our lives and he does the exact wrong thing you can do. And that's sort of the template for them going forward is what's the wrongest thing you can do? That's sort of how we follow them." [...] Chris Pratt said he believed the conflict provided strong romantic and comedic potential for the characters: [...] "There definitely will be conflict in their relationship [...] there's still {{a lot of room for}} comedy in there, because we have good writers." ...|$|E
500|$|The plot of [...] "The Bob Next Door" [...] {{is based}} on the movie Face/Off. The opening couch gag also {{features}} Harold from [...] the 1955 children's book Harold and the Purple Crayon. Bart tries to tempt Walt to sing [...] "Three Little Maids from School Are We" [...] from The Mikado; the same song was also used in an earlier episode, [...] "Cape Feare", which also featured Sideshow Bob. Later in the show, when Sideshow Bob reveals his true identity, he exclaims he is now [...] "able to sing all the Gilbert & Sullivan I damn well please", followed by him pulling a Japanese fan out of the glove box and singing the opening notes of [...] "Behold The Lord High Executioner", another number from The Mikado, to Bart's horror. Marge and Homer tell Bart that a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> voices like Sideshow Bob's, such as [...] "Frasier on Cheers, Frasier on Frasier or Lt. Cmdr. Tom Dodge in Down Periscope." [...] Both of these characters were played by Sideshow Bob's voice, Kelsey Grammer.

500|$|Many of the {{original}} characters graduated from McKinley High {{at the end of}} the third season. Murphy said, [...] "We didn't want to have a show where they were in high school for eight years. We really wanted to be true to that experience." [...] Adult characters played by Matthew Morrison and Jane Lynch would remain to provide continuity to the series, though according to Falchuk, some students—Rachel, Finn and Kurt in particular—would likely remain on the show after they graduate. In May 2012, Murphy said that just because a character on the show graduates high school does not mean that they are leaving, [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> been writing Dianna's off the show, Amber's off the show — they're not off the show. I think Amber was talking about that bittersweet feeling of, 'I'll never be in the choir room with that exact group of people.' At least that's what she told me ... When I read that [...] I said, 'I think people will misconstrue that.' She's excited about where her character is going. They all are. I wanted to do the right thing by all of them."

[...] Pete Krebs also agreed: [...] "In Portland we got the brunt of Elliott's initial depression... <b>Lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> stories <b>of</b> their own experiences of staying up with Elliott 'til five in the morning, holding his hand, telling him not to kill himself." ...|$|R
500|$|When {{speaking}} on the conceptual basis of Ready, Songz said, [...] "You think about a record like 'LOL Smiley Face,' it's something real simple, {{but when you look}} at the title or listen to the record, you're like, 'Wow.' That's something great from a songwriter's perspective. I'm just trying to make hits and classic records that people can vibe to and live their life." [...] In an interview with BallerStatus, Songz commented on his thoughts of making a remix of the song, stating, [...] "I think there's going to be a remix for that song, because a lot of people dig it. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> hit me up actually about it. That song is blowing up real fast man." [...] He also stated the possibility of American rapper Nicki Minaj appearing on a remix, saying, [...] "She wanted to do more of a commercial record, a cuter sex record. 'LOL' was actually already done, but when she heard it, she hit me up, and said 'I love that song. You're a punk for not putting me on it.' She'll definitely be on the remix." [...] However no remix was seen to be in the works nor did it come to fruition.|$|E
500|$|Mays has deemed Emma an [...] "amazing" [...] {{character}} to play, and has explained: [...] "I don't find that female characters are always written {{with a lot}} of depth, but she's so well defined on the page. Sure, she's terrified of germs and in love with a married man, so seeing her as the voice of reason for the kids is amazing." [...] Emma's relationship with Will will continue to grow, as [...] "she has these moments of clarity when she's talking to Will because he calms her." [...] Mays described her in an interview with TheTVChick: [...] "She is a romantic at heart. But she’s practical. She’s very interesting, because she does have those dreams and hopes of finding the right man. And in her mind, even though Will Schuester’s married, that sort of guy is like the perfect guy for her. She’s very practical in the fact that she doesn’t want to be alone and she knows that she’s somewhat limited in a small town to men. And Ken Tanaka is a very nice man, he’s not exactly like Will, but he’s good to her and he’s solid. He’s got a job, and he understands her and he understands all her quirks and stuff. So she’s practical, she knows that just might be her lot in life. So it’s weird. She’s got this very dreamy side about her and who she wants to be and what she wants her life to be like. But she’s also got this very practical, down-to-earth, well this is kind of the best I can do thing. It’s funny a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> thought that part about her is weak. Like a weak character flaw, but I actually don’t think that’s true. I really just think that’s the practical side of her. I think that’s her being practical.

That's the great difference, after all. <b>Lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> talent; that's the gift.
