50|$|De Gekroonde Poelenburg is a Dutch paltrok mill - {{a wooden}} mill {{supported}} {{on a short}} central post and a ring of wooden rollers on a low brick base and designed specifically for sawing wood. The mill body is boarded, however the sawing floor is open on three sides with only the windward facing side and the side roofs giving protection against the weather. The entire mill is winded by a tailpole and winch. On the front is a stage, 3.0 m above ground for setting the sails. The sails are common sails with a span of 20.3 m. They are carried on a cast iron windshaft cast by foundry De Prins van Oranje as number 0430 in 1866. The brake wheel with 66 cogs on the wind shaft drives the crank wheel with 26 radial cogs on the horizontal crank shaft. There is no upright shaft. The crank shaft has three crank pins. Connecting rods from the crank pins drive the three frame saws. Reciprocating lever bars also drive the pawl and ratchet mechanisms which in turn drive the winches and the feeding mechanism of the log carriages through rack and pinion mechanisms. The winches {{can be used with}} the <b>log</b> <b>hoist</b> to lift logs from the water onto the sawing platform and to pull the log carriages back to their starting position.|$|E
50|$|De Otter is a Dutch paltrok mill - {{a wooden}} mill {{supported}} {{on a short}} central post and a ring of wooden rollers on a low brick base and designed specifically for sawing wood. The mill body is boarded, however the sawing floor is open on three sides with only the windward facing side and the side roofs giving protection against the weather. The entire mill is winded by a tailpole and winch. On the front is a stage, 2.80 m above ground for setting the sails. The sails are common sails with a span of 19.50 m. They are carried on Azobé wooden windshaft made by Saendijck in 1996. The function of the brake wheel is split between two wheels, one wheel with a flat outer rim for the brake blocks to work on and another wheel with 71 radial cogs driving the lantern wheel with 29 staves on the horizontal crank shaft. There is no upright shaft. Connecting rods from the three cranks drive the three wooden sawing frames. Reciprocating lever bars also drive the pawl and ratchet mechanisms which in turn drive the winches and the feeding mechanism of the log carriages through rack and pinion mechanisms.

50|$|De Eenhoorn is a Dutch paltrok mill - {{a wooden}} mill {{supported}} {{on a short}} central post and a ring of wooden rollers on a low brick base and designed specifically for sawing wood. The mill body is boarded, however the sawing floor is open on three sides with only the windward facing side and the side roofs giving protection against the weather. The entire mill is winded by a tailpole and winch. On the front is a stage, 2.80 m above ground for setting the sails. The sails are common sails with a span of 20 m. They are carried on a cast iron windshaft of unknown manufacturer. The brake wheel with 75 cogs drives the crank wheel with 33 radial cogs on the horizontal crank shaft. There is no upright shaft. The crank shaft has four crank pins to drive four sawing frames, one more than common in Dutch wind-sawmills. The mill is also a bit wider than common to accommodate the extra sawing frame. The rearmost sawing frame was later removed and replaced by a reciprocating weight to keep the mechanism balanced. Connecting rods from the crank pins drive the frame saws. Reciprocating lever bars also drive the pawl and ratchet mechanisms which in turn drive the winches and the feeding mechanism of the log carriages through rack and pinion mechanisms.

5000|$|McOuat {{built his}} [...] "castle" [...] single-handedly, {{beginning}} in 1903 {{when he was}} 51, and finally completing it in 1915. He felled and cut all of the red pine <b>logs</b> himself, and <b>hoisted</b> the finished, dovetailed beams (some of them weighing as much as 1600 lbs) into place by means of simple block and tackle.|$|R
50|$|After {{up to an}} hour without return fire, {{either a}} breeze came up or the fog burned off, and the British {{realized}} they had not been firing on a ship. This distraction allowed Arnold to escape down the lake to Addison, Vermont, where he burned his remaining fleet to prevent capture. Local lore goes further to say that local Islanders had <b>hoisted</b> <b>logs</b> on the island to look like masts. Rust marks from fired cannon shot are still visible on the rock.|$|R

One man stands atop the pile of logs on the car, the other two stand on logs {{awaiting}} loading on the ground beside the car. An ax is buried in a small pile of little logs in the foreground. Two large stumps are visible in the background near a steam powered winch at left. The forest is in the background...|$|R
5000|$|The {{transportation}} of timber was {{hampered by the}} rocky gorge in the middle valley. This section could not be traversed by rafts until 1768. As early as the early 18th century, Wüerttemberg's timber trading companies had attempted to create a rafting route by blasting through the rock in the riverbed in order to float the logs from the upper valley down to the Rhine and the Netherlands. However, due to differences with the Bishopric of Speyer in Gernsbach, most of the Württemberg timber at Huzenbach had to be transported about 200 metres up the mountain and then transported to the neighbouring valleys of the Nagold and Enz. For this purpose, a lift called the [...] "machine" [...] was built in 1755. The <b>logs</b> were <b>hoisted</b> up the steep mountain slope using a series of man-powered wheels. However, this rickety structure was abandoned {{after a few years}} and the transport was taken over again by wagons.|$|R
50|$|Stoplogs are {{hydraulic}} engineering control {{elements that are}} used in floodgates to adjust the water level or discharge in a river, canal, or reservoir. Stoplogs are sometimes confused with flashboards, as both elements are used in bulkhead or crest gates. Stoplogs are typically long rectangular timber beams or boards that are placed {{on top of each other}} and dropped into premade slots inside a weir, gate, or channel. Present day, the process of adding and removing stoplogs is not manual, but done with hydraulic stop <b>log</b> lifters and <b>hoists.</b> Since the height of the barrier can only be adjusted through the addition and removal of stoplogs, finding a lighter and stronger material other than wood or concrete became a more desirable choice. Other materials, including steel and composites, can be used as stoplogs as well. Stoplogs are designed to cut off or stop flow through a conduit.|$|R
