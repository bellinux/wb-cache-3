Various objects, shapes, symbols, and <b>letters</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> drawn or placed within that represent {{a mixture of}} Christian and occult ideas. Circles were believed to empower and protect what was contained within, including protecting the necromancer from the conjured demons.|$|E
500|$|Subjective {{frequency}} is {{how frequently}} subjects [...] a stimulus appears. Name <b>letters</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> noticed more and, consequently, assumed to occur {{more frequently than}} other letters. Early research into the impact of exposure showed that differences in subjective frequency yielded different results even when the [...] frequency was identical. Hoorens and Nuttin tested whether subjective frequency could be {{an explanation for the}} name-letter effect by asking subjects to rank-order the entire alphabet twice, once according to their letter preference and once according to estimated letter frequency. Subjects indeed significantly overestimated the frequency of letters in their names, although there was no significant positive correlation between the overestimation of frequency and the name-letter effect. The researchers also asked subjects to rate how much they liked their own name. Subjects who liked their name had a stronger name-letter effect {{than those who did not}} like their name, but they did not overestimate the frequency of own-name letters more than subjects who did not like their names. Hoorens and Nuttin concluded that there is no support for the subjective frequency hypothesis.|$|E
2500|$|Camel case {{is often}} used to transliterate initialisms into alphabets where two <b>letters</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{required}} to represent a single character of the original alphabet, e.g., DShK from Cyrillic ДШК.|$|E

2500|$|The Latin script, and {{occasionally}} other scripts, may be sprinkled within Korean texts for illustrative purposes, or for unassimilated loanwords. Very occasionally non-Hangul <b>letters</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> mixed into Hangul syllabic blocks, as [...] Ga at right.|$|E
2500|$|These {{conventional}} {{names are}} often used in other domains, such as physics and engineering, although other <b>letters</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> used. [...] For example, in a graph showing how a pressure varies with time, the graph coordinates may be denoted p and t. [...] Each axis is usually named after the coordinate which is measured along it; so one says the x-axis, the y-axis, the t-axis, etc.|$|E
2500|$|An {{otherwise}} unused <b>letter</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> reassigned. For example, Tibetan Braille, {{which is}} based on German Braille, reassigns [...] c, [...] q, [...] x, and [...] y, which are redundant in German.|$|R

50|$|The {{objective}} of the puzzle is to find words which can be made using a given group of <b>letters.</b> Each <b>letter</b> <b>may</b> only <b>be</b> used once in each word. Further rules <b>may</b> <b>be</b> set. One <b>letter</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> highlighted, and all words made must include that letter. A minimum length for words <b>may</b> <b>be</b> set. There is always at least one word {{that can be made}} using all of the available letters, and the rules may require that a maximum length word be found.|$|R
2500|$|A diaeresis is {{used when}} a {{combination}} of vowel <b>letters</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> either mistaken for a digraph or interpreted {{in more than one}} way: [...] "egoïstisch" [...] (egoistic), [...] "sympathieën" [...] (sympathies, preferences), [...] "reëel" [...] (realistic), [...] "zeeën" [...] (seas). On a line break that separates the vowels but keeps parts of a digraph together, the diaeresis becomes redundant and so is not written: ego-/istisch, sympathie-/en, re-/eel, zee-/en.|$|E

It is transliterated as twt-ꜥnḫ-ỉmn ḥqꜣ-ỉwnw-šmꜥ, {{and according to}} modern Egyptological convention is written Tutankhamun Hekaiunushema, meaning [...] "Living image of Amun, ruler of Upper Heliopolis". On his ascension to the throne, Tutankhamun took a praenomen. This is transliterated as nb-ḫprw-rꜥ, and, again, according to modern Egyptological convention is written Nebkheperure, meaning [...] "Lord of the forms of Re". The name Nibhurrereya in the Amarna <b>letters</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> closer to how his praenomen was actually pronounced.|$|E

2500|$|The same letter (or {{sequence}} of <b>letters)</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> pronounced {{in different ways}} when it occurs in different positions within a word. For instance, the digraph [...] represents the sound [...] {{at the end of}} some words, such as rough [...] At the beginning of syllables (i.e. the syllable onset), the digraph [...] is pronounced , as in the word ghost (pronounced [...] ). Conversely, the digraph [...] is never pronounced [...] in syllable onsets and is almost never pronounced [...] in syllable codas (the proper name Pittsburgh is an exception).|$|E
2500|$|New <b>letters</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{invented by}} modifying a similar letter. Modification may be done through moving the letter (thus [...] and [...] {{for a second}} e or i vowel), {{stretching}} the letter (again, [...] and [...] for e- and i-like vowels), or rotating or reflecting it. The latter is quite common, producing such pairs as [...] s – [...] sh and [...] n – [...] ny. See Hungarian Braille for an alphabet which has exploited a pattern of mirror images, and Thai Braille for the series [...] บ b, [...] ป p, [...] ผ ph1, [...] พ ph2.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{complication}} is syllables that {{consist of}} just a vowel (V). [...] Now, in some languages, this issue does not arise, for every syllable starts with a consonant. [...] This is common in Semitic languages and in languages of mainland SE Asia, and for such languages this issue need not arise. [...] For some languages, a zero consonant letter is used as though every syllable began with a consonant. [...] For other languages, each vowel has a separate letter that is used for each syllable consisting of just the vowel. [...] These letters are known as independent vowels, and are found in most Indic scripts. [...] These <b>letters</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> quite different to the corresponding diacritics, which by contrast are known as dependent vowels. [...] As {{a result of the}} spread of writing systems, independent vowels may be used to represent syllables beginning with a glottal stop, even for non-initial syllables.|$|E
