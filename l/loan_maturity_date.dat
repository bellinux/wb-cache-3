50|$|The term fixed {{maturity}} is applicable to {{any form of}} financial instrument under which the loan is due to be repaid on a fixed date. This includes fixed interest and variable rate loans or debt instruments, whatever they are called, and also other forms of security such as redeemable preference shares, provided their terms of issue specify a date. It is similar in meaning to 'redemption date'. However some such instruments may have no fixed <b>maturity</b> <b>date.</b> <b>Loans</b> with no <b>maturity</b> <b>date</b> continue indefinitely (unless repayment is agreed between the borrower and the lenders at some point) and may be known as 'perpetual stocks'.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} loan {{contracting}} {{from a private}} bank in Vietnam. We focus on the main loan contract features that the bank uses in lending to business firms, namely <b>loan</b> <b>maturity,</b> collateral and <b>loan</b> interest rate. Based upon the simultaneous equation model of Dennis et al. (2000) and the bank 2 ̆ 019 s loan contracting policies, we examine the possible interdependency of the three different loan contract terms. Also, we try to determine which firm characteristics and exogenous factors are relevant for loan contracts. We find strong interdependencies between these contract terms with significant bi-directional relationships between collateral and <b>loan</b> <b>maturity,</b> <b>loan</b> rate and <b>loan</b> <b>maturity,</b> and a uni-directional relationship between loan rate and collateral. The conflicting signs within the collateral 2 ̆ 013 <b>loan</b> <b>maturity</b> relationship and the loan interest rate 2 ̆ 013 <b>loan</b> <b>maturity</b> relationship {{can be explained by}} our hypothesis that the choice for a certain <b>loan</b> <b>maturity</b> is primarily determined by borrowers 2 ̆ 019 behaviors, whereas the loan rate and the collateral requirements are primarily determined by banks policies. In addition, our results support the relevance of firm quality, agency costs of debt and relationship lending in loan contract design...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the genetic {{determinism}} of flowering and <b>maturity</b> <b>dates,</b> two traits highly affected by global climate change. Flowering and <b>maturity</b> <b>dates</b> were evaluated on five progenies from three Prunus species, peach, apricot and sweet cherry, during 3 - 8 years. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) detection was performed separately {{for each year}} and also by integrating data from all years together. High heritability estimates were obtained for flowering and <b>maturity</b> <b>dates.</b> Several QTLs for flowering and <b>maturity</b> <b>dates</b> were highly stable, detected each year of evaluation, suggesting {{that they were not}} affected by climatic variations. For flowering date, major QTLs were detected on linkage groups (LG) 4 for apricot and sweet cherry and on LG 6 for peach. QTLs were identified on LG 2, LG 3, LG 4 and LG 7 for the three species. For <b>maturity</b> <b>date,</b> a major QTL was detected on LG 4 in the three species. Using the peach genome sequence data, candidate genes underlying the major QTLs on LG 4 and LG 6 were investigated and key genes were identified.

40|$|This thesis makes three {{different}} {{contributions to the}} literature on bank income diversification {{and its effect on}} bank performance. Firstly, the study makes a theoretical contribution by incorporating non-interest income components into Ho and Saunders (1981) model in the presence of pricing strategies, including bundling and loss-leader strategies, as well as being well-informed and less-informed customers. The model distinguishes fees and commissions income and trade income by proposing the conditions that create the negative relationships with net interest margin. The study also empirically tests the theoretical relationships for the European banking system and the results state that both fees and commissions income and trade income negatively affect interest margin. Secondly, this study examines the relationship between interest and non-interest income sides by considering the switching cost for customers created by <b>loan</b> <b>maturity</b> for non-interest products. Theoretically, the study derives an equation that long-term loans create a switching cost for the sale of non-traditional products. The theoretical contribution is empirically tested for the UK banking system using unique UK banking data over the period 2005 - 2012. The empirical results suggest that by shifting <b>loan</b> <b>maturity</b> from short term to long term creates a switching cost for non-interest product sale. This empirical finding leads to test switching cost created by long-term loan, particularly for trade products. Shifting the maturity from short term to long term creates switching cost for trade products either. Thirdly the study contributes by investigating the aftermath of findings on the relationship between interest and non-interest income sides, and switching cost created by increasing <b>loan</b> <b>maturity.</b> The third study in this thesis contributes to the literature by examining the effect of non-interest income, conditional on deposit and <b>loan</b> <b>maturities,</b> on bank performance using UK banking data as a laboratory from 2005 to 2012. The study finds that fees and commissions income do not explain bank performance. However, when the fees and commissions variables are conditional on longer <b>loan</b> <b>maturity,</b> it alleviates the risk-adjusted bank performance. Trade income increases the bank performance. However when it is dependent on deposits and <b>loans</b> with long <b>maturities,</b> it has an adverse effect on bank performance. The result of direct maturity diversification indicates that, while the UK banks do not benefit from deposit diversification, the <b>maturity</b> diversification of <b>loan</b> is linked to a higher bank performance...|$|R

By using a binary logistic model, we have found that <b>loan</b> <b>maturity</b> is shorter for older and mature firms, firms owned by female and firms experiencing a shortage of liquidity. At the same time, we have also found that firms having concentrated ownership structure and more tangible assets can borrow for a longer period. In addition to that, we have found evidence that <b>loan</b> <b>maturity</b> is longer for the firms located closer to a bank branch. We also provide empirical support for the assumption that bank low competition is associated with longer maturity. From the obtained results, we may recommend SMEs to borrow from banks that are within their vicinity since this may increase the <b>maturity</b> of <b>loans.</b> Policy makers are recommended to implement policies so that to alleviate gender-related discrimination and take initiatives to moderate the level of competition at this market. © Foundation of International Studies and CSR, 2017...|$|R
