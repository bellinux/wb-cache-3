5|$|Evolution of the {{adaptive}} immune system occurred in an ancestor of the jawed vertebrates. Many of the classical molecules of {{the adaptive}} immune system (e.g., immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors) exist only in jawed vertebrates. However, a distinct lymphocyte-derived molecule has been discovered in primitive jawless vertebrates, such as the lamprey and hagfish. These animals possess a large array of molecules called Variable <b>lymphocyte</b> receptors (VLRs) that, like the antigen receptors of jawed vertebrates, are produced from {{only a small number}} (one or two) of genes. These molecules are believed to bind pathogenic antigens in a similar way to antibodies, and with the same degree of specificity.|$|E

Tentative evidence supports the short-term safety of teriflunomide, with common side effects including: headaches, fatigue, nausea, hair loss, and limb pain. There have also been reports of liver failure and PML with its use and it is dangerous for fetal development. Most common side effects of dimethyl fumarate are flushing and gastrointestinal problems.

25|$|An {{increase}} in <b>lymphocyte</b> concentration {{is usually a}} sign of a viral infection (in some rare case, leukemias are found through an abnormally raised <b>lymphocyte</b> count in an otherwise normal person). A high <b>lymphocyte</b> count with a low neutrophil count might be caused by lymphoma. Pertussis toxin (PTx) of Bordetella pertussis, formerly known as lymphocytosis-promoting factor, causes a decrease in the entry of lymphocytes into lymph nodes, which can lead to a condition known as lymphocytosis, with a complete <b>lymphocyte</b> count of over 4000 per μl in adults or over 8000 per μl in children. This is unique in that many bacterial infections illustrate neutrophil-predominance instead.|$|E

40|$|Human B- and T-lymphocyte {{preparations}} {{were isolated}} by separating T <b>lymphocytes</b> that formed rosettes with sheep erythrocytes from unrosetted B <b>lymphocytes.</b> Pokeweed mitogen stimulates {{the proliferation of}} both B- and T-lymphocyte preparations.

The basis for this synergy was shown to be the capacity of T <b>lymphocytes</b> to facilitate the proliferation of B <b>lymphocytes</b> cultured with pokeweed mitogen or phytohaemagglutinin.
