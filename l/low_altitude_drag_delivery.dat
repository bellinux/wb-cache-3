500|$|Republic Aviation {{started the}} Thunderchief as an {{internal}} project {{to replace the}} RF-84F Thunderflash, which first used the characteristic wing-root air intakes to place cameras in a pointed nose. The design team led by Alexander Kartveli examined some 108 configurations before settling on a large, single-engine AP-63FBX (Advanced Project 63 Fighter Bomber, Experimental), specifically AP-63-31. The new aircraft was intended primarily for supersonic, <b>low</b> <b>altitude</b> penetration to deliver a single, internally carried nuclear bomb. The {{emphasis was placed on}} low-altitude speed and flight characteristics, range, and payload. The aircraft would be fitted with a large engine, and a relatively small wing with a high wing loading for a stable ride at <b>low</b> <b>altitudes,</b> and less <b>drag</b> at supersonic speeds. Traditional fighter attributes such as maneuverability were a secondary consideration.|$|R
40|$|The {{probability}} of collision between a spacecraft and another object is calculated for various altitude and orbit conditions, and factors affecting the probability are discussed. It is shown that a collision can only occur when the spacecraft is located at an altitude which is between the perigee and apogee altitudes of the object and that the probability per unit time is largest when the orbit of the object is nearly circular. However, at <b>low</b> <b>altitudes,</b> the atmospheric <b>drag</b> causes changes with time of the perigee and the apogee, such that circular orbits have a much shorter lifetime {{than many of the}} elliptical orbits. Thus, when the collision probability is integrated over the lifetime of the orbiting object, some elliptical orbits are found to have much higher total collision probability than circular orbits. Rocket bodies used to boost payloads from low earth orbit to geosynchronous orbit are an example of objects in these elliptical orbits...|$|R
40|$|The Miniature X-ray Solar Spectrometer (MinXSS) is a 3 Unit (3 U) CubeSat {{designed}} for a 3 -month mission to study solar soft X-ray spectral irradiance. The first of the two flight models was deployed from the International Space Station in 2016 May and operated for one year before its natural deorbiting. This was the first flight of the Blue Canyon Technologies XACT 3 -axis attitude determination and control system [...] a commercially available, high-precision pointing system. We characterized {{the performance of the}} pointing system on orbit including performance at <b>low</b> <b>altitudes</b> where <b>drag</b> torque builds up. We found that the pointing accuracy was 0. 0042 - 0. 0117 (15 " - 42 ", 3 σ, axis dependent) consistently from 190 km - 410 km, slightly better than the specification sheet states. Peak-to-peak jitter was estimated to be 0. 0073 (10 s^- 1) - 0. 0183 (10 s^- 1) (26 " (10 s^- 1) - 66 " (10 s^- 1), 3 σ). The system was capable of dumping momentum until an altitude of 185 km. We found small amounts of sensor degradation in the star tracker and coarse sun sensor. Our mission profile did not require high-agility maneuvers so we are unable to characterize this metric. Without a GPS receiver, it was necessary to periodically upload ephemeris information to update the orbit propagation model and maintain pointing. At 400 km, these uploads were required once every other week. At ∼ 270 km, they were required every day. We also characterized the power performance of our electric power system, which includes a novel pseudo-peak power tracker [...] a resistor that limited the current draw from the battery on the solar panels. With 19 30 % efficient solar cells and an 8 W system load, the power balance had 65 % of margin on orbit. We present several recommendations to other CubeSat programs throughout.

40|$|While {{several studies}} have {{examined}} the abiotic effects of <b>altitude</b> (<b>low</b> ambient temperatures and hypoxia) on the aerobic performance of small mammals, few have explored the effects of development and maturation at different altitudes on aerobic performance as adults. We examined the basal metabolism and aerobic performance of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) under four different developmental and testing regimes: (1) reared (gestation through weaning) and tested at high altitude; (2) reared and tested at low altitude; (3) reared at <b>low</b> <b>altitude</b> and tested at high altitude after acclimation; and (4) reared at <b>low</b> <b>altitude</b> and tested in hypoxia without acclimation. We found that mice that developed and were tested at <b>low</b> <b>altitudes</b> had a higher aerobic capacity (both aerobic performance and basal metabolic rate) than those that developed, or were acclimated as adults, at high altitudes. In addition, we found that mice that developed at high altitude did not have a higher aerobic capacity than those that developed at <b>low</b> <b>altitude</b> and were acclimated to high altitude as adults. Both groups tested at high altitudes had higher hematocrits (% red blood cells) and hemoglobin than mice tested at <b>low</b> <b>altitudes.</b> Surprisingly, mice acclimated to <b>low</b> <b>altitudes</b> and given an instantaneous exposure to hypoxia did not suffer a depression in aerobic performance...|$|R
40|$|The neurocognitive {{basis of}} the effect of {{long-term}} high altitude exposure on voluntary attention is unclear. Using event related potentials, the high altitude group (people born in <b>low</b> <b>altitude</b> but who had lived at high altitude for 3 years) and the <b>low</b> <b>altitude</b> group (living in <b>low</b> <b>altitude</b> only) were investigated using a voluntary spatial attention discrimination task under high and low perceptual load conditions. The high altitude group responded slower than the <b>low</b> <b>altitude</b> group, while bilateral N 1 activity was found only in the high altitude group. The P 3 amplitude was smaller in the high altitude compared to the <b>low</b> <b>altitude</b> group only under high perceptual load. These results suggest that long-term exposure to high altitudes causes hemispheric compensation during discrimination processes at early processing stages and reduces attentional resources at late processing stages. In addition, the effect of altitude during the late stage is affected by perceptual load...|$|R

30|$|Our current {{understanding}} of the aeronomy of Mars is very limited. The two Viking landers each carried a mass spectrometer [4] and a retarding potential analyzer [5]. Thus we have insitu neutral gas composition and plasma density, composition and temperature information from only the equivalent to a single sounding rocket flight. The other in-situ plasma composition data, comes from the ASPERA instrument [6] on Mars Express (MEX), which has been providing information on the density, composition and energy of ions and electrons of energies between about 10  eV to ~ 36  keV at altitudes beyond about 300  km. Much electron density data exists from the MARSIS instrument on MEX [7] from in situ and remote wave sounding - spottily from radio occultation observations obtained on early missions (e. g. Mariners, Viking, Russian “Mars” missions) and more comprehensively from the radio science limb occultation experiments on the more recent Mars Express [8] and Mars Global Surveyor [9] missions. The same Mars missions also provided some remote and inferred atmosphere information from UV occultation, from <b>low</b> <b>altitude</b> aerobreaking-phase satellite <b>drag</b> data (MRO, MGS, Odyssey) and more extensively from Mars Global Surveyor (MGS), reflectometer measurements of atmosphere-scattered electron pitch angle distributions (e.g.,[10]). Finally the analogy between Mars and Venus, with similar atmosphere composition and regions with no intrinsic surface magnetic fields, has also provided important insights about the aeronomy of this poorly studied region of Mars. This {{is a lot of}} information, particularly of the electron density distributions. However, we have only glimpses of the overall complexity of the atmosphere and plasma states - there is, as of now, almost a complete absence of the thermal, composition and dynamical parameters that define the underlying physics of the Martian aeronomy.|$|R

Scions resulted from grafting between Hongshan pear and Shinseiki pear {{in the previous year}} were grafted once more on Hongshan pear at <b>low</b> <b>altitude.</b> C. Scions from trees planted at high altitude were grafted on Sungmao pear stock. D. Scions from trees planted at <b>low</b> <b>altitude</b> were grafted on Sungmao pear stock. Scions of treatment B and D were stored for about 600 hours at 5 â to break dormancy. Results indicated that scions from trees cultivated at <b>low</b> <b>altitude</b> could be used for â parasitic-graftingâ and fruit prodution at the same sea level. The fruits thus obtained have the same quality as those of the other treatments, this seems to indicated that scions which are needed for fruit production at <b>low</b> <b>altitude,</b> will no longer rely on the supply of Lishan area. Among these four treatments, fruits derived from scion of Sungmao pear stock seems to have better quality than those from Hongshan pear. Note: Scion means scion of Shinseiki with flower bud. 本試驗共有四個處理：A為高海拔地區栽培之新世紀梨，具有花芽之枝條作接穗寄接在橫山梨砧上。B為去年寄接於低海拔地區橫山梨上發生之新世紀梨枝條，取其具有花芽者作接穗，寄接於橫山梨砧上。C為高海拔新世紀梨接穗寄接在松茂梨砧上。D為低海拔新世紀梨接穗寄接在松茂梨砧。其中B、D二處理之接穗均經在 5 ℃之低溫下冷藏六百小時左右以打破休眠。結果發現去年寄接在低海拔梨砧上之新世紀梨所產生之枝條，其具有花芽者亦可供作寄接生產接穗之用，其果實之品質與以高海拔接穗寄接者無顯著差異，證明今後寄接生產所需之花芽接穗可不必完全仰賴梨山地區之供應。其中以松茂梨為砧木者其果實品質似橫山梨砧著為佳...|$|R
