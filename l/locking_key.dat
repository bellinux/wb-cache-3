50|$|The Berlin key (also known as, German, Schließzwangschlüssel, or, English, forced <b>locking</b> <b>key)</b> {{is a key}} for a type of door lock. It was {{designed}} to force people to close and lock their doors (usually a main entrance door or gate leading into a common yard or tenement block). Its particularity {{comes from the fact}} that it has two key blades (the part which activates the bolt), one at each end of the key, rather than the usual single blade. After unlocking the lock, the key must be pushed all the way through the lock and retrieved on the other side of the door after it has been closed and locked again. The mechanism makes the retrieval of the key impossible when the door is unlocked. Also, locking an open door is usually not possible.|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) composites jacket for pile rehabilitation relies {{mostly on the}} continuity of repair system. This paper presents {{the development of a}} new type of FRP jacket with an innovative, easy-fit and self-locking mechanical joining system and the evaluation of the suitability of this composite repair system for pile rehabilitation and concrete formwork. An intensive characterisation of the mechanical properties of the composite resin for the interlocking teeth and <b>locking</b> <b>key</b> of the jacket was conducted. Similarly, finite element (FE) simulation on the behaviour of the FRP jacket subjected to internal pressure was performed and verified through full-scale experimental testing. The results showed that the use of a microfibre composite resin provide the highest capacity joint. Further, the embedment of an FRP rod in the <b>locking</b> <b>key</b> resulted in an FRP jacket with a better joint performance. The results of the FE simulations showed a good agreement with the experimental results in predicting the lateral expansion in the elastic stage, capacity and failure behaviour of the FRP jacket. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} a dynamical order induced by coupling and/or noise in systems of coupled oscillators. The dynamical order {{is referred to}} a one-dimensional topological structure of the global attractor of the system {{in the context of}} random skew-product flows. We show that if the coupling is sufficiently strong, then the system exhibits one dimensional dynamics regardless of the strength of noise. If the coupling is weak, then it is shown numerically that the system also exhibits one dimensional dynamics provided the noise is sufficiently strong. We also show that for any coupling and any noise, the system has a unique rotation number and hence all the oscillators tend to oscillate with the same frequency eventually (frequency <b>locking).</b> <b>Key</b> words.

50|$|Some {{of the few}} C64 {{programs}} that fail on a C128 will run correctly when the CAPS <b>LOCK</b> <b>key</b> is pressed down (or the ASCII/National key on international C128 models). This {{has to do with}} the larger built-in I/O port of the C128's CPU. Whereas the SHIFT <b>LOCK</b> <b>key</b> found on both C64 and C128 is simply a mechanical latch for the left SHIFT <b>key,</b> the CAPS <b>LOCK</b> <b>key</b> on the C128 can be read via the 8502's built-in I/O port. A few C64 programs are confused by this extra I/O bit; keeping the CAPS <b>LOCK</b> <b>key</b> in the down position will force the I/O line low, matching the C64's configuration and resolving the issue.|$|R

50|$|Num Lock or Numeric Lock (⇭) {{is a key}} on the numeric keypad of most {{computer}} keyboards. It is a <b>lock</b> <b>key,</b> like Caps <b>Lock</b> and Scroll Lock. Its state (on or off) {{affects the}} function {{of some of the}} keys, and is commonly displayed by an LED built into the keyboard.The Num <b>Lock</b> <b>key</b> exists because earlier 84-key IBM PC keyboards did not have cursor control or arrows separate from the numeric keypad. Most earlier computer keyboards had separate number keys and cursor control keys; however, to reduce cost, IBM chose to combine the two in their early PC keyboards. Num Lock would be used to choose between the two functions. On some laptop computers, the Num <b>Lock</b> <b>key</b> is used to convert part of the main keyboard to act as a (slightly skewed) numeric keypad rather than letters. On some laptop computers, the Num <b>Lock</b> <b>key</b> is absent and replaced by the use of a key combination.|$|R

Some models, especially those which lack an OSD, switch to the input corresponding to the number key pressed after Scroll Lock, {{or in the case}} of some 2-port switches, the up and down arrow keys.

50|$|The Caps <b>Lock</b> <b>key</b> {{originated}} as a Shift <b>lock</b> <b>key</b> on mechanical typewriters. An early {{innovation in}} typewriters was {{the introduction of}} a second character on each typebar, thereby doubling the number of characters that could be typed, using the same number of keys. The second character was positioned above the first on the face of each typebar, and the shift key caused the entire type apparatus to move, physically shifting the positioning of the typebars relative to the ink ribbon. Just as in modern computer keyboards, the shifted position was used to produce capitals and secondary characters.|$|R
50|$|The Shift <b>lock</b> <b>key</b> was {{introduced}} so the shift operation could be maintained indefinitely without continuous effort. It mechanically locked the typebars in the shifted position, causing the upper character to be typed upon pressing any key. Because the two shift keys on a typewriter required more force to operate and {{were meant to}} be pressed by the little finger, it could be difficult to hold the shift down for {{more than two or three}} consecutive strokes, therefore the introduction of the Shift <b>lock</b> <b>key</b> was also meant to reduce finger muscle pain caused by repetitive typing.|$|R
