5|$|Classic {{learning}} {{theories and}} the modern dual-coding theory support the introduction of interesting, tangential details to <b>learning</b> <b>content.</b> There is evidence that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and is better remembered because it allows storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems. This suggests that interesting material, even if tangential to the topic, does not detract from learning and can promote recall of vague or uninteresting material.|$|E

500|$|Seductive {{details are}} often used in textbooks, lectures, slideshows, {{and other forms of}} {{educational}} content to make a course more interesting or interactive. Seductive details can take the form of text, photos, illustrations, sounds or music and are by definition: (1) interesting and (2) not directed toward the learning objectives of a lesson. [...] John Dewey, in 1913, first referred to this as “fictitious inducements to attention.” While illustrated text can enhance comprehension, illustrations that are not relevant can lead to poor learning outcomes. Since the late 1980s, many studies in the field of educational psychology have shown that the addition of seductive details results in poorer retention of information and transfer of learning. Thalheimer conducted a meta-analysis that found, overall, a negative impact for the inclusion of seductive details such as text, photos or illustrations, and sounds or music in <b>learning</b> <b>content.</b> This reduction to learning is called the seductive details effect. Recently, there have been many criticisms of this theory. Critics cite unconvincing and contradictory evidence to argue that seductive details do not always impede understanding and that seductive details can sometimes be motivating for learners.|$|E

40|$|Reflecting on the {{personal}} utility and value of <b>learning</b> <b>contents</b> is important for motivation building and engagement in high quality learning processes. We investigated {{the effects of a}} personal-utility prompt in journal writing on students’ learning motivation and comprehension in biology education. 40 students of a German secondary school took part in a quasi-experimental field study. The students kept a weekly learning journal over six weeks. For writing their journal entries, the students received a brief instruction that either did or did not include a personal-utility prompt. Results showed that {{the personal}}-utility prompt successfully supported the students in reflecting about the personal utility of the <b>learning</b> <b>contents.</b> Consequently, students in the personal-utility prompt condition reported higher degrees of learning motivation and achieved better comprehension scores as compared to students who had no personal-utility prompt available. Evidently, using journal writing to reflect upon the utility and value of <b>learning</b> <b>contents</b> is a beneficial method to support students’ learning motivation and comprehension in secondary science education...|$|R

40|$|Current {{teaching}} strategies mainly follow instructional or constructive pedagogical models. In instructional model <b>learning,</b> <b>contents</b> are authored {{for teaching and}} evaluation of a concept. Whilst in constructive model, a student is exposed to the learning environment {{that allows him to}} learn new concepts, and his actions provide an evaluation of his under-standing of the concept. Manual authoring of such <b>learning</b> <b>contents</b> not only requires spe-cialized skills, thinking and dedication, but they also take large amount of time. Similarly within instructional environment, authoring any new content that supports the current teaching activity is very difficult. This paper presents an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) that facilitates the authoring of <b>learning</b> <b>contents</b> for both instructional and constructive {{teaching strategies}}. Proposed ITS uses semantic web formalism, namely ontology, for knowledge representation. This work shows that ontologies correctly and consistently mod-els the domain knowledge that supports pedagogical activities, software development activi-ties, ITS user friendly interface and provides robust reasoning facility for creation of dy-namic contents. The proposed ITS provides authoring facility explicitly for teaching cogni-tive skills such as classification, relatedness, comparison (sequencing, discrimination, size etc) and reasoning. With the use of ontologies, cognitive skills are translated into con-cepts/classes and properties/roles with restrictions. Reasoning and inference provided by on-tologies are used for dynamic authoring of <b>learning</b> <b>contents.</b> Finally evaluation of proposed ITS is conducted for its correctness and consistency of domain knowledge, usability and ef-ficiency & effectiveness of contents authoring...|$|R

40|$|E-learning and {{distance}} learning are {{all forms of}} learning that take place outside of a traditional learning environment and can be alternatives for learners who {{are not able to}} study in a traditional environment for various reasons. With advancement in technologies and increased use of smart phone, mobile learning has gained popularity as another form of learning and has enabled learners to learn anywhere and anytime. Ubiquitous learning takes mobile learning to another level by providing contents that are context and location aware. There is therefore the need to provide mobile devices with the right <b>learning</b> <b>contents</b> for the right users. The right <b>learning</b> <b>contents</b> should be adaptive to the learner’s location, as well as learning style and device etc. To be able to implement the learning, learning management systems play the important role in creating, managing, and delivering the <b>learning</b> <b>contents.</b> In this paper, a location-based Learning Management System for adaptive and personalized mobile learning is presented. The systems makes use of 5 R Adaptation Framework for Location based Mobile learning, the location-based dynamic grouping algorithm, and concepts of the IMS Learning Design model to produce a location-based adaptive mobile learning setting...|$|R
