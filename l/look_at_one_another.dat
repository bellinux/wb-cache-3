25|$|According to some accounts, captives were {{provided}} with shared buckets to use as toilets, {{and did not have}} access to running water. Although captives share their cells with dozens of other captives, there were reports in 2006 that they were not allowed to speak with one another, or to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b>|$|E
500|$|While much of {{the prior}} work in {{automated}} virtual camera control systems has been directed towards reducing {{the need for a}} human to manually control the camera, the Director's Lens solution computes and proposes a palette of suggested virtual camera shots leaving the human operator to make the creative shot selection. [...] In computing subsequent suggested virtual camera shots, the system analyzes the visual compositions and editing patterns of prior recorded shots to compute suggested camera shots that conform to continuity conventions such as not crossing the line of action, match placement of virtual characters so they appear to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> across cuts, and favors those shots which the human operator had previously used in sequence.|$|E
500|$|The {{pilot was}} shot in April 1995 and {{directed}} by Michael Lessac. Although set in Cleveland, the show was actually filmed at the Warner Bros. Television studios in Burbank, California. Helford had noticed that the cast {{did not look at}} each other while saying their lines and he tried to encourage them to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> so they would laugh. Helford told Lessac to bring the cast in on a weekend, where there was no pressure, so they could [...] "goof around" [...] and relax. Drew's job required him to work from a cubicle and Helford stated that no one had really done a show dealing with that situation, as producers and networks felt it was too confined. Helford disagreed and had a set where an accessible cubicle was the centerpiece designed and built. The Memphis Plaza Lounge in Old Brooklyn was the inspiration for the show's bar The Warsaw Tavern. The owner of the Lounge refused to sell the naming rights to Warner Bros, but he did agree that they could film the front of the building. The crew shot the building in 1995 and temporarily replaced The Memphis Plaza Lounge sign with their own Warsaw Tavern one. The sign was hung in the front window for two years before Warner Bros. took it down.|$|E

60|$|A silence. The two ladies, {{feeling a}} little helpless, again <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b>|$|E
60|$|They <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> {{and their}} hearts died within them.|$|R
60|$|The Four <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> and <b>at</b> Mowgli, puzzled but obedient.|$|R
60|$|The conspirators <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> and smiled, {{but held}} their peace.|$|R
60|$|The boys hesitate, <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> and {{presently}} {{say that}} they had rather sit together.|$|E
60|$|They <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> each {{waiting for}} one of the others to suggest something. Silence.|$|E
60|$|The {{murmur of}} a crowd rises from the beach below. Caesar and Rufio <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b>|$|E
60|$|Frida and Philip <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> {{with quick}} glances, and laughed.|$|R
60|$|The two men <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> The mystery was maddening, impenetrable.|$|R
60|$|The {{two small}} boys failed to understand. They <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{two friends}} rise and <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> Mr. Bagnet's gravity has now {{attained}} its profoundest point.|$|E
60|$|They all <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> as {{if there}} were some {{sinister}} significance in what she has said.|$|E
60|$|They <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> {{significantly}} for a moment. Than Richard exhales a {{deep breath}} and turns towards Judith.|$|E
60|$|The two men <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> her quickly, {{and then}} <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b>|$|R
60|$|And for {{a moment}} they all three stood silently <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b>|$|R
60|$|We {{stopped and}} <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> {{the moment we}} were alone again.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Bennet goes out--on {{her way to}} the kitchen. The Misses Wetherell <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> again. The {{hammering}} recommences.|$|E
60|$|He moved away, and for {{a moment}} Hetty and Miss Schuyler did not <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> Then Hetty stood up.|$|E
6000|$|CRAMPTON (a quaint jocosity {{breaking}} through his forlornness). Well, daughter? (They <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> for a moment, with a melancholy sense of humor.) ...|$|E
60|$|Then the Mota men <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> {{and knew}} what would follow.|$|R

60|$|Mr. Blatherwick's {{reply was}} almost {{incoherent}} in its excess of protestation. They {{walked down the}} room together. Harcutt and Wolfenden <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b>|$|E
60|$|They turn. All three <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> For {{a moment}} {{they make a}} motion as if to ring for tea. Then they stand petrified.|$|E
60|$|The {{friendly}} movers {{made such}} an obvious {{effort not to}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> that {{they might as well}} have stared at one another with all their might.|$|E
60|$|Philippa and Helen <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> {{a little}} dolefully across the luncheon table.|$|R
