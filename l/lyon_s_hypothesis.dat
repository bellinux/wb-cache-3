40|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{causes of}} small clutch sizes in tropical and Southern Hemisphere regions are poorly understood. Alexander Skutch proposed 50 {{years ago that}} higher nest predation in the south constrains {{the rate at which}} parent birds can deliver food to young and thereby constrains clutch size by limiting the number of young that parents can feed. This hypothesis for explaining differences in clutch size and parental behaviors between latitudes has remained untested. Here, a detailed study of bird species in Arizona and Argentina shows that Skutch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>hypothesis</b> explains clutch size variation within North and South America. However, neither Skutch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>hypothesis</b> nor two major alternatives explain differences between latitudes...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with two things. First, the determinants of foreign direct investment (FDI) and second, the relationship between FDI and trade in Indonesia. This study focuses on two major investors, Japan and America. Although {{there are a number}} of theories and empirical studies explaining FDI determinants, most of these works focus on developed countries, mainly the European and American economies. In this study we opted to use Vernon 2 ̆ 7 s and Kojima 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>hypotheses</b> of the catching-up product cycle and comparative advantage which are more appropriate to explaining FDI in developing economies, especially Japanese FDI in Indonesia. For American FDI, we use the eclectic theory of Dunning, with a core theory derived from Hymer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>hypothesis</b> of firm-specific advantage...|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the language used}} to name the village in Jombang, East Java {{from the perspective of}} Whorf 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>hypothesis</b> stating that individual 2 ̆ 7 s frst language inﬂuence his idea and thought on the reality. In addition, there is also correlation between language and culture both subordinatively and coordinatively. This article aims at describing Whorf 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>hypothesis</b> on how language, culture, and though give inﬂuence on the naming of villages in Kabuh, Jombang, East Java. The fnding shows that the villages are named after the local name of plants and ﬂowers such as Drenges, Tales, Jati Raja, Kedung Jati, Randu Alas, Kedung Pandan. This fnding affrms that the way they name their villages is inﬂuenced by they perceive their surrounding environment...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship of}} forcible rape to three variables: age, time period and cohort over a 20 -year period, 1965 - 1984. The study also tested Richard Easterlin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> cohort <b>hypothesis</b> utilizing forcible rape arrest-rate statistics from the U. S. Uniform Crime Reports. Easterlin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>hypothesis</b> suggests that crime rates will fluctate according to the relative size of age cohort. In short, large cohorts generate higher arrest rates than small cohorts. We tested this hypothesis as it is applied to forcible rape arrest rates. The findings disclosed that both age and cohort, but not time period had a significant relationship to forcible rape arrest rates. The variable age had a more significant relationship to forcible rape arrest than does cohort. Therefore, Easterlin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>hypothesis</b> was not confirmed. Males from 15 to 24 {{are more likely to}} commit forcible rape than any other age group. Consequently, this age group should be targeted for prevention, control, and treatment programs...|$|R
