50|$|A method {{with similar}} {{advantages}} to mechanical milling is <b>laser</b> <b>etching</b> and laser drilling. Etching PCBs with lasers offers the same advantages as mechanical milling {{in regards to}} quick turnaround times, but {{the nature of the}} <b>laser</b> <b>etching</b> process is preferable to both milling and chemical etching when it comes to physical variations exerted on the object. Whereas mechanical milling and chemical etching exact physical stress on the board, <b>laser</b> <b>etching</b> offers non-contact surface removal, making it a superior option for PCBs where precision and geometric accuracy are at a premium, such as RF & microwave designs.Laser drilling is more precise, has extremely low power consumption compared with other techniques, requires less maintenance, does not use lubricants or drill bits, low rates of wear, does not use abrasive materials, does not ruin the boards, is more eco friendly, and in the most high-powered machines, the drilling is instant, but is expensive.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{approach}} of a texturing process combining surface modification by ultra-short pulsed <b>laser</b> radiation and <b>etching</b> techniques is developed. The hybrid process {{is divided into}} two steps: Firstly, the surface of a silicon wafer is modified by laser radiation. For this purpose, the influence of several laser parameters, e. g. wavelength, pulse duration and energy density, have been analyzed. Secondly, the surface texture is fabricated by an etching process. The modification threshold of the laser treatment is determined for different silicon materials. Different surface modifications occur for different materials after applying the laser treatment. No significant influence of the pulse duration or focus radius is found. Furthermore, the influence of laser processing and plasma etching on reflectivity spectra is compared and interactions between <b>laser</b> and <b>etching</b> parameters are investigated. The developed hybrid process results in smooth and fine surface microstructures. First results show a reduction of the reflectivity in the range of 30 % compared to the reflectivity of unstructured wafers...|$|R

40|$|O bjectives: Bond {{strength}} of composite resin to enamel and dentin of primary teeth {{is lower than}} that to permanent teeth; therefore, it may compromise the ad- hesive bonding.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of tooth preparation with bur and Er:YAG laser on shear bond {{strength of}} com- posite to enamel and dentin of primary teeth. Materials and Methods: Seventy-five primary molar teeth were collected and 150 specimens were obtained by mesiodistal sectioning of each tooth. In each of the enamel and dentin groups, the teeth were randomly assigned to 3 subgroups with the following preparations: bur preparation + etching (37 % H 3 PO 4), <b>laser</b> preparation + <b>etching,</b> and <b>laser</b> preparation without <b>etching.</b> Single Bond adhe- sive and Z 250 composite were applied to all samples. After thermocycling, the shear bond strength testing was preformed using the Instron Testing Machine. Data were analysed using SPSS- 17 and two-way ANOVA. R esults: The bond strength of enamel specimens was significantly higher than that of dentin specimens, except for the laser-non-etched groups. The enamel and dentin laser-non-etched groups had no significant difference in bond strength. In both enamel and dentin groups, bur preparation + etching yielded the highest bond strength, followed by <b>laser</b> preparation + <b>etching,</b> and the <b>laser</b> preparation with- out etching yielded the lowest bond strength (P < 0. 001).
