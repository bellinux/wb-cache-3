40|$|Background: currently, {{assessment}} of outcomes after joint replacement is predominantly centred on impairment and activ-ity limitation (e. g. walking), with little consideration of participation restriction. Method: structured telephone interviews about participation in <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> {{were conducted with}} 56 total hip replace-ment (THR) and 60 total knee replacement (TKR) patients before and 1 year after joint replacement. Findings: before surgery, THR patients participated in 209 <b>leisure</b> <b>activities,</b> {{with an average of}} four <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> per person. TKR patients participated in 171 <b>leisure</b> <b>activities,</b> with an average of three <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> per person. The <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> were coded into four categories: sports/exercise, hobbies, social activities and holidays. Between 89 and 95 % of <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> were rated as important by THR and TKR patients prior to surgery. Before surgery, THR patients rated 82 % of <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> as difficult to perform because of joint problems, which decreased to 25 % of <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> by 1 -year after surgery. TKR patients rated 86 % of <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> as difficult to perform because of joint problems, which decreased to 32 % after surgery. Conclusion: this research highlights that participation in <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> is important to patients undergoing joint replace-ment, but that approximately a quarter of patients are unable to perform their valued <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> after surgery...|$|R

50|$|Data was {{collected}} {{from a group}} of Croatian citizens ranging across various age groups. The participants estimated their SWB and time spent participating in <b>leisure</b> <b>activities.</b> These <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> included active socializing and going out (sports, going to clubs, eating dinner out etc.), visiting cultural events (reading books, going to concerts, going to movies etc.), and family and home activities (going to church, visiting family, watching television etc.). The results of the study found specific <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> to be a predictor of SWB across age groups. For people ages 31-60 participation in visiting cultural events, family <b>leisure</b> <b>activities,</b> and active socializing and going out contributed to SWB. A significant positive correlation was found between family <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> and SWB of men and women across different age groups. This study concluded that participation in <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> lead to SWB, though the importance of such specific <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> vary across different age and genders. Essentially, people may improve their SWB by participating in <b>leisure</b> <b>activities,</b> especially in family and home activities.|$|R

5|$|Specific {{findings}} in sociological studies of leisure are illustrated by John Robinson's late-1970s study of American leisure. Robinson found that Americans, on average, have {{four hours of}} leisure time each weekday, and more on weekends—six hours on Saturdays, almost eight on Sundays. Amount of leisure time diminishes with age, work, marriage, and children. However, the amount of free time does not significantly depend on an individual's wealth. People desire less free time if they are uncertain of their economic future, or if their job is their central interest. During {{the second half of}} the twentieth century, watching television became a major <b>leisure</b> <b>activity,</b> causing a substantial decrease in the time dedicated to other activities; in the early 1970s the average American had 4 hours of leisure per day, and spent 1.5 of them watching television. Shared leisure activities increase marital satisfaction.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or <b>leisure</b> <b>activity</b> into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, {{as in the case}} of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, {{as in the case of}} games, where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion for example with stage magic. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.|$|E
5|$|Thousands {{of plant}} species are {{cultivated}} for aesthetic purposes {{as well as}} to provide shade, modify temperatures, reduce wind, abate noise, provide privacy, and prevent soil erosion. Plants are the basis of a multibillion-dollar per year tourism industry, which includes travel to historic gardens, national parks, rainforests, forests with colorful autumn leaves, and festivals such as Japan's and America's cherry blossom festivals. While some gardens are planted with food crops, many are planted for aesthetic, ornamental, or conservation purposes. Arboretums and botanical gardens are public collections of living plants. In private outdoor gardens, lawn grasses, shade trees, ornamental trees, shrubs, vines, herbaceous perennials and bedding plants are used. Gardeners may cultivate the plants in a naturalistic state, or may sculpture their growth, as with topiary or espalier. Gardening is the most popular <b>leisure</b> <b>activity</b> in the U.S., and working with plants or horticulture therapy is beneficial for rehabilitating people with disabilities. Plants may also be grown or kept indoors as houseplants, or in specialized buildings such as greenhouses that are designed for the care and cultivation of living plants. Venus Flytrap, sensitive plant and resurrection plant are examples of plants sold as novelties. There are also art forms specializing in the arrangement of cut or living plant, such as bonsai, ikebana, and the arrangement of cut or dried flowers. Ornamental plants have sometimes changed the course of history, as in tulipomania.|$|E

In the next chapter I devote to system of care for children and youth {{in the area of}} <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> in the Czech Republic. In the third part I define interests and their division. The following chapter deals with problems of exclusion, high-risk behaviour and its prevention. The last chapter defines sector of providers and recipients of <b>leisure</b> <b>activities.</b> For the qualitative survey I have chosen technique of interviews, which I have performed with personal staff from institutions providing <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> in the Pilsen region. <b>Leisure</b> <b>activities</b> help to children and youth to spend free time meaningfully. The aim of the research part of my bachelor thesis was to map institutions acting in the field of organisation of <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> for children and youth from groups threatened with social exclusion in the Pilsen region. The research questions I have put in the way, that I would ascertain, if the supply of <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> for children and youth from groups threatened with social exclusion in the Pilsen region is various and also, if supplied <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> for children and youth from groups threatened with social exclusion are financial available even for underprivileged families. For the purpose of the research I have addressed 47 institutions providing <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> for children and youth in the Pilsen region, from which only 11 have cooperated with me. From these I have chosen for the next cooperation the institutions, which organise <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> for children and young people from groups threatened with social exclusion. The majority of my respondents, specifically seven, are made up from houses for children and youth, I have cooperated with three institutions, which are directed to work with children and youth threatened with social exclusion, it's referring to Association of Romany civil initiatives AMARE, ČHAVE, Club Atom and the Children's home with school, primary school and school dining room Měcholupy. I have also cooperated with Centre of leisure time Pilsen. I have ascertained with the survey that the broadest supply of <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> in the Pilsen region is in big towns. From the survey follows that even in smaller towns is the supply of <b>leisure</b> <b>activities,</b> regarding number of interested persons, sufficient. Children have the biggest interest for motion and creative activities. The major part of interested persons for <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> are made up from girls and boys of younger school age, approximately from the second degree of primary school girls predominate. To promotion of the supply of <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> interviewed institutions use web pages and handbills, or they advertise in the press or in Facebook.

Methods: Functional and neuropsychological abilities of 120 outpatients with probable AD were evaluated at baseline, at 36 and 54 months. Data collected at baseline included socio-demographics, clinical variables, education and frequency of participation in <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> throughout life. All participants and/or caregivers answered the questionnaire, "Participation in <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> throughout life" while patients completed the MMSE, the Clinical Dementia Rating scale, neuropsychological tests from the Lisbon Screening for Dementia Assessment, Barthel Index and Lawton and Brody's Index. Results: AD patients with higher levels of education achieved better results on cognitive tests. The participants with higher participation in <b>leisure</b> <b>activities</b> exhibited better results on cognitive and functional tests than those with lower participation.
