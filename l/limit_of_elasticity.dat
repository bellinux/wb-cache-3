5000|$|The Xpandrel {{method of}} {{expanding}} mandrels {{was introduced in}} the mid-1990s. This method uses basic mechanical principles of deformation to achieve expansion of a non-tapered mandrel. Using various methods of actuation, the body of the mandrel is deformed below the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>elasticity</b> to provide repeatable holding forces without typical deformation caused by pressing on tapered mandrels. Other commercial mandrels are very slightly tapered, and the hollow object slides down the taper until it [...] "sticks". The shop-made mandrel shown in the photo is designed to clamp a hollow tube or gear between the two tapered plugs. There is little about such a mandrel that can't be made right on the lathe on which it is to be used, so {{it is not uncommon for}} machinists to make a mandrel to hold a particular item and then set the mandrel aside hoping to use it again some day. Mandrels of this type are usually set in the lathe on centers and turned with a lathe dog.|$|E
40|$|Fracture of nickel-titanium {{rotary files}} is an {{iatrogenic}} error which can seriously jeopardize root canal therapy. If a high-torque motor is used, the instrument-specific limit-torque (fracture limit) is often exceeded, thus increasing {{the risk of}} intracanal failure. A possible {{solution to this problem}} is to use a low-torque endodontic motor which operates below these values. If the torque is set just below the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>elasticity</b> for each instrument, the risk of fracture is likely to be markedly reduced. The purpose of this paper was to discuss mechanical properties of NiTi rotary instruments, the rationale for selecting low torque values, and to use clinically a new endodontic motor (step-motor) which operates below the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>elasticity</b> of each rotary file. The step-motor was found to be helpful in reducing the risk of instrument fracture. Irreversible material damage (plastic deformation) and instrument fracture were rarely seen.

40|$|It {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{problems}} in soil mechanics to describe the mechanical response ofsoils under cyclic loading conditions. The objective of this study is to clarify the stress-strainbehaviors when the loading direction is reversed. For the purpose conventional triaxialtests for a saturated clay were performed in which deviator stress was applied in compressionstate and unloaded to failure in extension state. Stress-strain behavior has been found to be elastic in some portion after the moment ofunloading of shear stress and beyond the portion the behavior begins to be elasto-plastic. Such a <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>elasticity</b> can be determined in stress space and the variation with the defor-mation history having been given before unloading are discussed. On the other hand shearmodulus G can be determined as the slope of the linear portion of stress-strain relationship. The effects of deformation history on G are also discussed. A few of conclusions are summarized as follows: 1) A parameter defined as a function of stress ratio at the start of unloading and stressratio at the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>elasticity</b> appears to be related to shear strain given before unload-ing uniquely in spite of both drainage condition and OCR. 2) G is not influenced by the degree of the deformation history if effective mean stressis not altered during deformation history as in drained tests but it decreases in thecase when effective mean stress decreases with shear as in undrained tests for normallyconsolidated clays...|$|E

The objects are disks of the same size but, in general, of different materials. Potential applications include the design of new amorphous polymeric and related granular materials as well as the design of package cushioning systems. The problem is considered on a grid structure with a fixed step size w and for a fixed diameter of the discs, i. e., the number of placed disks may increase as the size of the placement region increases. The near-equilibrium configurations have to be calculated from uniformly distributed random initial placements. The final arrangements of disks must ensure that any particular object is deformed only within the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> the material. The main result concerns -approximations of the probability distribution on the set of equilibrium placements. Under a natural assumption about the configuration space, we prove that a run-time of n+logO(1) (1 /} is sufficient to approach with probability 1 ??? the minimum value of the objective function, where depends on the maximum of the escape depth of local minima within the underlying energy landscape. The result is derived from a careful analysis of the interaction among probabilities assigned to configurations from adjacent distance levels to minimum placements. The overall approach for estimating the convergence rate is relatively independent of the particular placement problem and can be applied to various optimization problems with similar properties of the associated landscape of the objective function...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} the failure mode of asphalt concrete and describes the stress-strain curve that governs asphalt concrete beyond the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>elasticity</b> in the ascending branch. The relationship of stress-strain is identical to that of cement concrete in compression. A general form of the behavioural curve is proposed to represent the elastic and plastic – damage of asphalt concrete. The nonlinear behaviour of asphalt concrete beyond the linear elastic limit swelling is visible to the naked eye. These parameters that define this form are physically significant and are determined experimentally. The parameters of the stress-strain curve are fundamental characteristics of a solid subjected to short term loading. The experiments used short term static compression loading on cylindrical asphalt concrete specimens, differing in mix types (Dense graded, Stone Matrix), air voids content, density, specimen size and temperature. There were significant changes in the peak stress and strains between the asphalt concrete mix types. Different strengths are attainable between asphalt concrete types as well as the properties of the mix constituents. The proposed equations fit a wide range of testing conditions and asphalt concrete type for both the ascending and descending branches of the stress-strain diagram in compression. The investigation derives parameters (yield stress and elastic modulus) for different asphalt concrete mix types which can be used in FE programs such as Abaqus that uses the elastic as well as plastic data to model the behaviour of different mix types of asphalt concrete material used in a pavement structure...|$|E
