40|$|Oceanographics factor such {{as water}} {{transparency}} and current speed {{have an important role}} in fishing operation of bagan Rambo (large typed <b>liftnet</b> with light attraction). Research was conducted in Makassar Strait from March to June 2002 to analysis the relationship between those factors (catch and fishing operation). The results indicated that correlation between transparency and total catch was very low. The correlation between current speed with total catch was significant for occurred in 15 m depth. In relation to the fishing operation, there was certain toleration of the current speed for operation of the bagan Rambo. If surface current parallel with sub current, fishing operation is more easy than the surface current goes across with underwater current...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed to}} {{describe}} the horizontal distribution profiles of sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) data on anchovy fishing ground {{for the period of}} June -September 2014. The experimental fishing was conducted by using a large <b>liftnet</b> (local commercial fisheries) at the fishing base of Ponrang fish landing, Luwu district. Catch and fishing position data were collected for each fishing position and satellite data (Terra/MODIS) of both SST and Chl-a were extracted at all fishing locations. The results showed that the highest catch occurred where the SST and Chl-a ranges were from 29. 0 ???C to 29. 5 ???C and from 0. 45 mg m- 3 to 0. 75 mg m- 3, respectively. The facts revealed that the selected oceanographic parameters provide a good indicator in explain the ancovy distribution in in the Bone Bay...|$|E
40|$|Introduction : The Utilization of {{fisheries}} resource in Indonesia waters has just achieved about half (56. 06 %) {{of the maximum}} sustainable yield. In the north coast of Central Java, which has a coastal line of about 450 kilometers, 20 types of fishing gear are owned by fishermen. Experiment : Data were collected from Annual Report 1993 – 1997 issued by Central Java Fisheries Agency. Twenty types of fishing gear were classified into 6 groups, i. e. seine nets, purse seine, gillnets and trammel nets, lift nets, lines, and traps. Two of them were categorized as unselective fishing gear, i. e. seine nets and purse seine, whereas the other 4 were classified as selective ones. The number of each group was expressed in means and percentages and the development/changes thereof was presented in percentage. Results and discussion : The number of unselective fishing gears grew rapidly from 1996 to 1997, i. e. seine nets 17. 31 % and purse seine 12. 07 %. on the country the number of selective fishing gear increased slightly or even decreased, for example traps (5. 98 %), line (4. 13 %), <b>liftnets</b> (- 3. 21 %), and gill nets & trammel nets (- 2. 45 %). The management {{of fisheries}} resources should {{be focused on the}} enhancement in the number of selective fishing gear and the extension of their fishing ground, combined with close monitoring on the mesh size of unselective fishing gear...|$|R

The experiment were conducted in Makassar Strait used a bagan rambo (large typed <b>liftnet</b> with light attraction) with ligting power 16. 4 kW. From the total 33 individuals Russel`s scad (TL: 8. 3 ??? 20. 5 cm), their eye???s balls were sampled and prepared for the histological examination of the retina. Adaptation ratio was calculated from the cone and pigment movement in each experimental condition by using Cone Index and Pigment Index. 		Concerning the light adaptation process, the movement patterns of the pigment and cone were different in natural condition and simulation, where in the natural condition the Russell` scad caught by the bagan rambo is light adapted occurred after midnight. The other hand in the simulation condition Russel`s scad was light adapted in 45 and 35 lux after 1 hour lighting. Russell` scad very sensitive to the light, {{as shown by the}} accurence of cone movement even the light illumination was low of 14 lux. 	In relation to the fishing operation of bagan rambo, if the Russell`s scad as a target species, the effectively hauling time can be done as 3 times at the one night time is enough...|$|E

The experiment were conducted in Makassar Strait used a bagan rambo (large typed <b>liftnet</b> with light attraction) with lighting power 16. 4 kW. From the total 33 individuals anchovy (TL: 6. 0 ??? 10. 5 cm), their eye???s balls were sampled and prepared for the histological examination of the retina. Adaptation ratio was calculated from the cone and pigment movement in each experimental condition using Cone Index and Pigment Index. 		Concerning the light adaptation process, the movement patterns of the pigment and cone were different in natural condition and simulation, where in the natural condition the anchovy caught by the bagan rambo was fully light adapted at each hauling time. One the other hand, in the simulation condition anchovy was fully light adapted at 45 and 35 lux after 1 hour lighting. Anchovy is high light illumination preference, as shown by the slow of cone movement even the light illumination was low of 14 lux. 	In relation to the fishing operation of bagan rambo, if the anchovy as a target species, the hauling time, 4 to 5 times at the night time is optimum condition...|$|E
40|$|Despite major criticism, catch {{per unit}} effort (CPUE) is still widely {{used as a}} measure for {{the size of the}} {{exploited}} stock, but its indicative value is affected by selection of a proper unit of effort. The unit of effort used in the Indonesian fisheries statistical system is poorly standardised with one trip made by a fishing unit of any type. Therefore, changes in catchability, induced by technical innovations cannot be accounted for in official statistics and thus bias the perception of fisheries authorities on the state of stocks. This study shows that differences in technical characteristics in a coastal <b>liftnet</b> fishery on small pelagics around Ambon, such as unit size and type of lamps used to attract fish, influence both effort allocation and catch per trip. Larger fishing units (more windlasses) are more commercially orientated. They have a larger nonzero catch per trip–– 1. 5 times larger nonzero catch per added windlass––and ignore potentially small catches, as shows from their higher proportion of zero-catches. The shift from kerosene to electric lamps does not lead to a higher catch per trip, but the use of electric lamps is less laborious, inviting fishermen to fish also under more unfavourable light conditions such as during full moon. Model simulations of average catch per trip of two fishing areas show that technical innovations in the last 20 years have increased the mean catch per trip by a factor of 4. 1 in the fishing area with the largest technical improvements. Technical improvements explain 80 f the change in catch per trip in the official statistics over the last 15 years. Furthermore, the variance in catch per trip among individual fishing units has increased and so has the uncertainty in the average CPUE, as only part of the fishermen implemented technical improvements. Both developments stress the poor indicator value of catch per trip for developments in fish stock biomass and the importance to standardise the unit of effort. The characteristic high variability in catch in this fishery will always obscure effects of technical improvements in more local situations and smaller timeframes. Because of the inconsistent effects of the type of lamps used on the catch rate, it is questionable whether standardising the unit of effort by the type of lamp used will enlarge the precision in the CPUE. Nevertheless, standardising the unit of effort {{by the size of the}} unit will enlarge the precision in, and the indicator value of the CPUE in more aggregated catch data as used on higher levels in the fisheries administration of Indonesia...|$|E
40|$|Fishermen {{experience}} {{variation in}} their daily catches that they cannot explain from their knowledge and experience. This uncertainty in daily catch rate {{is important in the}} life of fishermen and should be seen as a main characteristic of a fishery. This study tries to decrease the gap in knowledge on this subject by (1) characterising uncertainty in daily catch rate, (2) analysing the sources of this uncertainty and (3) outlining the consequences of uncertainty for the organisation of the fishery and its management. The purse-seine and <b>liftnet</b> fisheries on small pelagic fish in the coastal waters around Ambon and the Lease Islands (Central Moluccas, Indonesia) are used in this study, because they are among the most uncertain fisheries in the world on a daily basis. Daily catches range from 0 to 25 times the average catch (coefficient of variation > 3) and a large proportion of this variability cannot be accounted for. The large uncertainty in catch rates of individual fishing units derives from the relationship between the loosely structured pelagic environment in which the fisheries operate and the small scale of operation of these fisheries. The multispecies character of the fisheries reduces the uncertainty in total catch relative to that of catches of individual species. However, the developments in the total catch have little indicative value for the catch rates of individual species. The uncertainty in catch rates may be further increased by comparison or combination of catch data from different fishing units with different technical characteristics, if effects of these on the catchability are not accounted for. Therefore, the use of non-standardised catch per unit of effort as an indication {{of the state of the}} stocks is questionable. The consequence of this high uncertainty is that individual fishermen are hardly able to perceive spatial and temporal patterns in fish distribution and thus cannot optimise the outcome of their fishery through spatial allocation of effort. This results in risk-aversive behaviour, i. e. concentrated effort near the homeport. These effort concentrations may lead to local overfishing, which, in turn, reduce the accuracy of the perception of the status of the stocks by individual fishermen and local authorities even further. The inaccurate perception limits the role of both groups in fisheries management aiming at sustainable exploitation of the stocks. The high level of uncertainty in combination with the low monetary outcome shapes the livelihood of individual crewmembers, because they need additional income to feed their families. The resulting dependency on other sources of income in combination with the uncertainty has a substantial impact on the organisation of the fishery. Hence we conclude that both the local organisation of the fisheries and the perception of individual fishermen and local authorities should be integrated into fishery management plans in order to be successful...|$|E
