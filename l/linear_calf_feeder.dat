Holstein-Friesian (H-F) and Jersey (J) calves were fed by automatic milk replacer (MR) and concentrate feeders. Feeding behaviour, including MR consumption, drinking speed, number of rewarded and unrewarded visits to the feeder as well as concentrate consumption, was recorded by the feeders. A modified version of the Wisconsin calf health scoring criteria chart was used to score calves’ clinical measurements and identify incidences of BRD. Thus, 40 % of calves were found to have at least one incident of BRD. Feeding behaviour was altered during incidents of BRD. The number of unrewarded visits to the feeder was reduced, by approximately four visits, for calves with BRD during the 3 d prior to the identification of BRD (P < 0. 05) and tended to be reduced during the 7 d following the identification of BRD (P = 0. 05), compared with healthy calves. Additionally, calves with BRD had a tendency for reduced net energy intake (approximately 8 %) during the 3 d prior to the identification of BRD, compared with healthy calves. Therefore, calf feeding behavioural data, recorded by electronic feeders during the pre-weaning period, can indicate cases of BRD. peer-reviewe...|$|R

An initial management survey was conducted for each farm. Observations on facilities, calf weights and heights, blood samples to estimate serum total proteins, treatment records, digital feeding behavior records, and milk or milk replacer (MMR) samples were collected at each visit. Additional milk replacer (MR) samples were collected for 4 wk pre- and post-circuit cleaning. Samples of MMR were plated on Aerobic Plate Count (APC) and Coliform Count (CCP) Petrifilms. Total solids concentration was estimated for MR samples by refractometry. Feeding plans varied widely between farms.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the value of}} near infrared reflectance (NIR) measurement of corn nutrient composition to livestock feeders, sequential decision models of beef cattle and swine feeding were developed. Corn composition data from the National Feedstuff Composition Data Bank (NFCDB) were used to derive probability density functions for crude protein, fat, and lysine content. Expected values of profit and other variables were computed by numerical integration. Means of crude protein and lysine of the NFCDB sample were lower and higher, respectively, than National Research Council estimates. These differences caused errors in diet formulations which resulted in losses due to imperfect information of up to 47 per year per head of one-time capacity in feeding yearling steers, up to 41 per year per head of one-time capacity in feeding steer calves and up to 6. 50 per year per head of one-time capacity in feeding swine;The difference between the expected values of NIR-generated information and of NFCDB sample means was very small. One-time capacities of approximately 40, 000 yearling cattle, 12, 500 calves of 2, 200 swine were necessary to justify investment in an analyzer based on net present value when NIR-generated information (versus NFCDB sample means) was used to formulate diets to meet recommended nutrient allowances. Minimum one-time capacities declined to 2, 550 yearling cattle, 1, 700 calves or 1, 080 swine when diets were formulated to meet nutrient requirements;NIR-generated information was more valuable to yearling steer feeders than to steer <b>calf</b> <b>feeders</b> on an annual basis, given continuous production. This result was due to yearling steers 2 ̆ 7 requiring fewer days to reach market weight thereby allowing more animals to be fed per year;Losses due to imperfect knowledge in beef cattle feeding were largest when corn had low crude protein content and high fat content.

40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsRodney D. JonesAfter {{remaining}} {{stable for}} several decades, corn price has recently had unprecedented price increases and volatility. United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) predicts an average corn price of $ 5. 80 per bushel for 2008, which is 232 % of its 28 -year (1980 - 2007) {{average price of}} $ 2. 50. The record increase in corn price {{was the result of}} increased starch-based ethanol production associated with increased energy costs, and other factors such as a declining value in the United States dollar, and increased global commodity demand. High corn prices have impacted the profitability of the livestock feeding industry. It was less clear how the record high corn prices would affect the cow-calf industry since corn is not a significant input for cow-calf enterprises. This study quantified the relationship between cow-calf profitability and corn price. Because feed costs for a cow-calf producer are among the highest variable costs for the operation, both grazing and non-grazing feed costs were estimated as a function of corn price. Models were estimated to determine if a relationship between corn price and Returns Over Variable Costs (ROVC) at the cow-calf level could be identified. Corn price from 1978 - 2007 explained none of the variability in grass grazing rental rate, however when the projected 2008 corn price was included in the analysis, corn price explained 10 % of the variation in grass grazing rates. Year (linear time trend) and corn price from 1978 - 2008 explained 88 % of historical grass grazing rental rate variability, 71 % of alfalfa price variability, and 63 % of other hay price variability in Kansas. These results suggest that the new corn market paradigm likely will increase the relationship between corn price and feed costs at the cow-calf level. Several models were evaluated using bulk diesel fuel price, <b>feeder</b> <b>calf</b> price, corn price, alfalfa price, other hay price, and grass grazing rental rate to estimate Kansas cow-calf producer ROVC. Models that included diesel fuel price, <b>feeder</b> <b>calf</b> price, grazing rent, and one of the harvested feeds (corn, alfalfa, or other hay) price explained 90 - 91 % of the variability in ROVC. Models that included diesel fuel price, <b>feeder</b> <b>calf</b> price, and either grazing rent or corn price explained less of the variability in ROVC; using grazing rent explained 89 % and using corn price explained 79 %. Including grass grazing rental rate along with corn price, <b>feeder</b> <b>calf</b> price, and bulk diesel fuel price improved the model's ability to predict ROVC, explaining 91 % of the variability. While cow-calf producers might use very little corn directly in their operations, this research shows that corn price is an important determinant of cow-calf production returns, and corn price can be used by producers to plan for future rising costs in order to maximize returns...|$|R

40|$|The dairy {{industry}} {{in the developed world}} has undergone profound changes over recent decades. In this paper, we present an overview {{of some of the most}} important recent changes in the {{dairy industry}} that affect health and welfare of dairy cows, as well as the science associated with these changes. Additionally, knowledge gaps are identified where research is needed to guide the dairy industry through changes that are occurring now or that we expect will occur in the future. The number of farms has decreased considerably, whereas herd size has increased. As a result, an increasing number of dairy farms depend on hired (nonfamily) labor. Regular professional communication and establishment of farm-specific protocols are essential to minimize human errors and ensure consistency of practices. Average milk production per cow has increased, partly because of improvements in nutrition and management but also because of genetic selection for milk production. Adoption of new technologies (e. g., automated <b>calf</b> <b>feeders,</b> cow activity monitors, and automated milking systems) is accelerating. However, utilization of the data and action lists that these systems generate for health and welfare of livestock is still largely unrealized, and more training of dairy farmers, their employees, and their advisors is necessary. Concurrently, to remain competitive and to preserve their social license to operate, farmers are increasingly required to adopt increased standards for food safety and biosecurity, become less reliant on the use of antimicrobials and hormones, and provide assurances regarding animal welfare. Partly because of increasing herd size but also in response to animal welfare regulations in some countries, the proportion of dairy herds housed in tiestalls has decreased considerably. Although in some countries access to pasture is regulated, in countries that traditionally practiced seasonal grazing, fewer farmers let their dairy cows graze in the summer. The proportion of organic dairy farms has increased globally and, given the pressure to decrease the use of antimicrobials and hormones, conventional farms may be able to learn from well-managed organic farms. The possibilities of using milk for disease diagnostics and monitoring are considerable, and dairy herd improvement associations will continue to expand the number of tests offered to diagnose diseases and pregnancy. Genetic and genomic selection for increased resistance to disease offers substantial potential but requires collection of additional phenotypic data. There is every expectation that changes in the dairy industry will be further accentuated and additional novel technologies and different management practices will be adopted in the future...|$|R

Three general forecasting approaches used by agricultural economists are (1) the models presented by Box and Jenkins, which include the autoregressive-integrated moving-average (ARIMA) forecasting models (non-causal); (2) economic models (causal); and (3) composite forecasting models. The ARIMA models were employed by [Oliveira, et al. ] to forecast beef prices. Economic models have recently been used by [Agriculture Canad...|$|R

40|$|The cow/calf {{enterprise}} {{has been}} a profitable enterprise {{over the last few}} years. Weaned calf prices have been unprecedented. It wasn’t that long ago that 500 pound calves sold for $ 60 per hundred-weight. For the last 4 years, 500 pound calves brought over $ 125 per hundred-weight. These high calf prices helped cow/calf producers reduce some debt and “heal-up” from times when the cow/calf enterprise was not very profitable. Estimated returns for a cow/calf enterprise reached a record $ 150 /head in 2004 and remained over $ 100 /head in 2005. Since then, returns have been under $ 50 /head, with expectations for further declines in profitability. The cattle industry is a cyclic industry. The national beef cow herd inventory expands and contracts. When beef cow inventory is low, calf supply is low, and calf prices are high. When calf prices are high, beef cow inventory grows, causing an increase in <b>feeder</b> <b>calf</b> supply, consequently price of calves decreases. The cattle cycle has typically been about ten years. The current cycle began in 2004 following the longest cattle cycle in history (14 years due to a long liquidation phase). There appear to be a number of items currently impacting beef industry. Producers need to prepare and position themselves to take advantage of opportunities that present themselves that will {{have a positive impact on}} their cow/calf enterprise. Following are items that I think could potentially impact the cow/calf enterprise. Some of the items will pose challenges, but often with every challenge there is an opportunity that could enhance profit potential for the cow/calf enterprise...|$|R
40|$|Probably one of {{the most}} popular buzz phrases in U. S. Industry today is Strategic Alliances. Perhaps, we should take a minute to define what a Strategic Alliance is because we are seeing some {{indiscriminate}} use of the phrase. Definition. Two or more independent parties combine their respective strengths such as their assets, resources, and management, which are synergistic with one another to form a vertically integrated alliance with the common objective of creating a much stronger and more competitive enterprise, which in its combination minimizes the risk that each entity has in operating separately. I believe that in order to make such an alliance successful that you must first have a need. Let 2 ̆ 7 s have a State of the Union assessment of the beef industry to see if such a need exists. Over the past three years, there has been 3 significant studies which probably best revealed the major problems facing the industry. The first was the report issued by the Value Based Marketing Task Force. The second was the National Beef Quality Audit, and the third was the National Beef Tenderness Study. The Value Based Marketing Task Force, which was jointly sponsored by the Beef Industry Council and the National Cattlemen 2 ̆ 7 s Association, was a first in several respects. First of all, it was history precedenting, by having each sector of the Beef Industry represented as a Task Force seeking common objectives. The Task Force membership was made up of Seed Stock Purebred Producers, Cow <b>Calf</b> Producers, Cattle <b>Feeders,</b> Packer-Processors, Purveyors, and Retailers. I was privileged to be {{one of the}} Cattle Feeders Representatives. There was enough sensitivity as to the makeup of the Task Force that an Anti-Trust Lawyer was present at most of the meetings to keep us out of trouble...|$|R
40|$|Reproductive, maternal, {{and weight}} traits were {{analyzed}} for Angus (A), Brahman (B), and Hereford (H) straightbred cows; F 1 and F 2 BA and BH cows; and 3 / 8 B 5 / 8 A first (Bn) and second (Bn 2) generation cows in Central Texas. Heterosis was estimated for calf crop born (CCB), calf crop weaned (CCW), and cow weight at palpation (PW) by linear contrasts within cow breed groups. F 1 BA cows expressed heterosis (P 0. 10) for CCB or CCW. Only the F 1 BA (22. 9 kg) and F 2 BH (42. 1 kg) groups expressed heterosis (P< 0. 10) for PW. Bn 2 cows (- 65. 7 kg) expressed negative heterosis (P< 0. 01) for PW. Heterosis for calf survival (CS), birth weight (BW), and weaning weight (WW) was estimated by <b>linear</b> contrasts within <b>calf</b> breed groups for B- and H-influenced calves. F 1 BH (0. 11) and F 2 BH (0. 14) calves expressed heterosis (P 0. 10) for BW, but B-sired F 1 BH calves were 5. 5 kg heavier (P< 0. 01) than H-sired F 1 calves at birth. F 1 BH (22. 4 kg) and F 2 BH (26. 2 kg) calves expressed heterosis (P< 0. 001) for WW, and H-sired F 1 BH calves were 20. 7 kg heavier (P< 0. 10) than B-sired F 1 calves at weaning...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsKevin C. DhuyvetterWhen {{purchasing}} feeder calves, bulls {{are typically}} discounted relative to steers. Most {{would agree that}} a discount is warranted but determining the appropriate discount to apply is considerably more difficult. Being able to calculate this discount under varying conditions would help stock operators maintain {{a certain level of}} profitability or recognize opportunities to make more profit when excessive discounts are being applied. The goals of this study were to determine how castration timing affects performance (as measured by average daily gain), morbidity, and carcass quality and how morbidity affects performance and carcass quality. Ordinary Least Squares regression and logit models were estimated to quantify the effects of various management and environmental factors on performance, morbidity, and carcass quality. These model estimates of production variables along with price and cost assumptions were used to calculate breakeven purchase prices and price discounts for bulls relative to steers, accounting for the possibility of contracting bovine respiratory disease, if owned for a short background period or if ownership is retained through slaughter. Model results confirm that late-castrated steers do indeed exhibit diminished performance and increased morbidity probabilities relative to early-castrated steers. Increased morbidity also decreases average daily gain. However, this study found that castration timing and morbidity during the backgrounding period have minimal effects on carcass quality, with morbidity only impacting hot carcass weight and castration timing significantly affecting days to market and only tending to impact hot carcass weight. Ultimately, based on 2009 market conditions, bulls should be discounted at <b>feeder</b> <b>calf</b> sales compared to steers. The average calf arrived at 459 pounds, and at this weight bulls should be discounted $ 4. 69 /cwt relative to the same weight steers. The discount increases to $ 5. 37 /cwt for 400 pound calves and drops to $ 4. 20 /cwt for 500 pound calves. If ownership is retained through slaughter, required discounts will change to $ 6. 77 /cwt, $ 4. 91 /cwt, and $ 7. 55 /cwt, respectively...|$|R
40|$|In 2003 - 2004, the Texas A&M University Ranch to Rail South program {{evaluated}} 430 steers in Edroy, TX. Data {{were analyzed}} on several traits, but <b>feeder</b> <b>calf</b> frame and muscle grades and health status were emphasized. Muscle thickness grade (M), frame size grade (F), muscle thickness by frame size interaction (M*F), sire breed type classification (SIRECODE), lung score (LUNG), ranch of origin (RANCH), {{and level of}} treatment (LVLTRT) were evaluated as independent variables as affecting ribeye area (REA), marbling score (MARB), fat thickness (FAT), hot carcass weight (HCW), average daily gain (ADG), medicine costs (MED), days on feed (DOF), initial value (VALUE), carcass value (CARVAL), and initial weight (INWT). M (P <. 0001), F (P <. 0001), M*F (P <. 0001), SIRECODE (P <. 0001), RANCH (P <. 0001), LVLTRT (P =. 0016), and INWT (P <. 0001) were all significant influences on initial value upon arrival. SIRECODE (P =. 0344), RANCH (P =. 0571), and INWT (P <. 0001) were significant in impacting carcass value. RANCH (P =. 0045) and INWT (P <. 0001) were very significant influences upon ribeye area when the steers were harvested. RANCH (P <. 0001) was also influential on marbling score, and LVLTRT (P =. 1096) was slightly significant for MARB. M (P =. 0659), F (P =. 0721), and M*F (P =. 0722) were moderately significant in influencing fat thickness. However, SIRECODE (P =. 0148) and RANCH (P <. 0001) were significant in impacting FAT. HCW was significantly affected by SIRECODE (P =. 0056), RANCH (P <. 0001), and INWT (P <. 0001). For live performance, SIRECODE (P =. 0120) and RANCH (P <. 0001) were significant influences upon average daily gain. SIRECODE (P <. 0001), RANCH (P <. 0001), LVLTRT (P <. 0001), and INWT (P <. 0001) were significant influences on days on feed for the steers. Finally, RANCH (P <. 0001) and LVLTRT (P <. 0001) were significant in affecting medicine costs. These findings suggest ranch of origin and breed type play major roles in affecting live and carcass performance...|$|R
