40|$|The current {{exoplanet}} database includes 5454 confirmed {{planets and}} candidate planets observed with the KEPLER mission. We find 932 planet pairs {{from which we}} extract distance and orbital period ratios. While earlier studies used the Titius-Bode law or a generalized version with <b>logarithmic</b> <b>spacing,</b> which both lack a physical model, we employ here the theory of harmonic orbit resonances, which contains quantized ratios instead, to explain the observed planet distance ratios and to predict undetected exoplanets. We find that the most prevailing harmonic ratios are (2 : 1), (3 : 2), and (5 : 3), in 73 % of the cases, while alternative harmonic ratios of (5 : 4), (4 : 3), (5 : 2), (3 : 1) occur in 27 % of the other cases. Our orbital predictions includes 171 exoplanets, 2 Jupiter moons, one Saturn moon, 3 Uranus moons, and 4 Neptune moons. The accuracy of the predicted planet distances amounts to a few percent, which fits the data significantly better than the Titius-Bode law or a <b>logarithmic</b> <b>spacing.</b> This information may be useful for targeted exoplanet searches with Kepler data and to estimate the number of live-carrying planets in habitable zones.

40|$|The {{geometric}} {{arrangement of}} planet and moon orbits into a regularly spaced pattern of distances {{is the result}} of a self-organizing system. The positive feedback mechanism that operates a self-organizing system is accomplished by harmonic orbit resonances, leading to long-term stable planet and moon orbits in solar or stellar systems. The distance pattern of planets was originally described by the empirical Titius-Bode law, and by a generalized version with a constant geometric progression factor (corresponding to <b>logarithmic</b> <b>spacing).</b> We find that the orbital periods T_i and planet distances R_i from the Sun are not consistent with <b>logarithmic</b> <b>spacing,</b> but rather follow the quantized scaling (R_i+ 1 /R_i) = (T_i+ 1 /T_i) ^ 2 / 3 = (H_i+ 1 /H_i) ^ 2 / 3, where the harmonic ratios are given by five dominant resonances, namely (H_i+ 1 : H_i) = (3 : 2), (5 : 3), (2 : 1), (5 : 2), (3 : 1). We find that the orbital period ratios tend to follow the quantized harmonic ratios in increasing order. We apply this harmonic orbit resonance model to the planets and moons in our solar system, and to the exo-planets of 55 Cnc and HD 10180 planetary systems. The model allows us a prediction of missing planets in each planetary system, based on the quasi-regular self-organizing pattern of harmonic orbit resonance zones. We predict 7 (and 4) missing exo-planets around the star 55 Cnc (and HD 10180). The accuracy of the predicted planet and moon distances amounts to a few percents. All analyzed systems are found to have ≈ 10 resonant zones that can be occupied with planets (or moons) in long-term stable orbits. Comment: 34 pages, 13 Figures, [URL]...|$|E

40|$|A {{model for}} the human cochlea is {{developed}} which describes and incorporates {{the functions of the}} inner and outer hair cells, the filtering or frequency separation performed along the basilar membrane, and loudness perception. The outer hair cells are modeled as active mechanical feedback elements which compress the dynamic range of the input signal and help to sharpen the tuning of the basilar membrane filtering. The compression is shown to be approximately logarithmic, thus explaining the <b>logarithmic</b> <b>spacing</b> of the just noticeable differences (JNDs) of input intensity. The inner hair cells are modeled as transducers with a transfer function related to the hyperbolic tangent. Loudness determination is modeled by an exponentiation of a transduced stimulus.

30|$|The Fourier {{transform}} {{defined as}} an infinite integral for continuous signals or an infinite summation (DTFT) for discrete-time signals is not {{a useful tool for}} the analysis of non-stationary signals. Spectral representations of non-stationary signals change with time. A short-time Fourier spectrum may be computed using a window in time centred at a given time instant. As a function of time, this spectrum provides information about the signal in a time-varying manner. The squared modulus of the STFT is known as the spectrogram. The main disadvantage of the STFT is that the frequency representation is uniformly sampled. The frequency bins of the same size regardless of whether high frequencies or low frequencies are being analysed. A <b>logarithmic</b> <b>spacing</b> of frequency, with the frequency step size proportional to the frequency, would permit better analysis of most real-world signals. The time-frequency bins of the STFT are rectangular. The main advantage is that it can be computed fast using the FFT algorithm. In order to keep the processing simple and to facilitate the establishment of values that are significantly different from zero, DFT using a sliding window is adopted as the method of analysis for non-stationary random processes here. It is assumed that the statistics of the process are stationary up to the third order within a window and change slowly as the window is translated. The process is also assumed to be ergodic provided a correspondence between windows is established across multiple epochs. The correspondence across realizations can be achieved by using a reference time that is constant for all epochs with regard to the physical processes and state changes that are taking place. For evoked EEG this reference is the time of application of the stimulus. Segments of each epoch that are equally offset in time from the reference can be assumed to have similar statistics and constitute an ensemble of epochs.|$|E
30|$|Despite their {{widespread}} diffusion as a {{tool for}} multimedia protection, watermarking schemes suffer from a series of disadvantages: (1) watermarking authentication is not backward compatible with previously encoded contents (unmarked contents cannot be authenticated later by just retrieving the corresponding hash); (2) the original content is distorted by the watermark; (3) the bit rate required to compress a multimedia content might increase due to the embedded watermark. An alternative solution for authentication and tampering identification is the use of multimedia hashes. Unlike watermarks, content hashing embeds a signature of the original content as part of the header information, or can provide a hash separately from the content upon a user's request. Multimedia hashes are inspired by cryptographic digital signatures, but instead of being sensitive to single-bit changes, they are supposed to offer proof of perceptual integrity. Despite some audio hashing systems (also named audio fingerprinting) being proposed {{in the past few years}} [10 – 12], most of the previous research, as for the case of watermarking, has concentrated on the case of images [13, 14]. In [10], the authors build audio fingerprints by collecting and quantizing a number of robust and informative features from an audio file, with the purpose of audio identification as well as fast database lookup. Haitsma and Kalker [11] build audio fingerprints robust to legitimate content modifications (mp 3 compression, resampling, moderate time, and pitch scaling), by dividing the audio signal in highly overlapping frames of about 0.3 seconds; for each frame, they compute a frequency representation of the signal through a filter bank with <b>logarithmic</b> <b>spacing</b> among the bands, in order to resemble the human auditory system (HAS). The redundance of musical sounds is exploited by taking the differences between subbands in the same frame, and between the same subbands in adjacent time instants; the resulting vector is quantized with one bit, and similarities between each short fingerprint are computed through the Hamming distance. By concatenating all the fingerprints of each frame, a global hash is obtained, which is used next to efficiently query a song database of previously encoded fingerprints. Though in principle such an approach could be used for identifying possible localized tampering in the audio stream, the authors do not explicitly address this problem. An excellent review of algorithms and applications of audio fingerprinting is presented in [12].|$|E
