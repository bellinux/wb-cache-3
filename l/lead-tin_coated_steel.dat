50|$|PPGI is pre-painted {{galvanised}} iron, {{also known}} as pre-coated <b>steel,</b> coil <b>coated</b> <b>steel,</b> color <b>coated</b> <b>steel</b> etc., typically with a hot dip zinc <b>coated</b> <b>steel</b> substrate.|$|R

50|$|The hot dip {{metallic}} coating process {{is also used}} to manufacture steel sheet and coil with coatings of aluminium, or alloy coatings of zinc/aluminium, zinc/iron and zinc/aluminium/magnesium which may also be factory pre-painted.

40|$|The {{weldability}} of zinc <b>coated</b> <b>steel</b> sheets {{is often}} compromised by weld seam defects caused by rapid zinc vaporisation and burned-off zinc. Owing to this, welded seams usually remain unprotected from corrosion and {{are accompanied by}} undesirable porosity.

The influences of laser droplet generation and welding process control parameters on the properties of joints of zinc <b>coated</b> <b>steel</b> sheets are presented.

40|$|Abstract. In this study, CrZrN {{film was}} {{deposited}} on AISI 4130 cylinder barrel and valve plate using a unbalanced magnetron sputtering. The tribological properties between a <b>coated</b> <b>steel</b> cylinder barrel and <b>coated</b> <b>steel</b> valve plate {{were evaluated by}} a custom-built disk-to-disk tribometer {{and the results were}} compared with those between a <b>coated</b> <b>steel</b> cylinder barrel and a conventional bronze valve plate. The lowest friction coefficients were observed between a <b>coated</b> <b>steel</b> cylinder barrel and <b>coated</b> <b>steel</b> valve plate and they were approximately one half of those between a <b>coated</b> <b>steel</b> cylinder barrel and conventional bronze valve plate in the range of testing up to 1600 rpm. Coated valve plate and bronze valve plate showed a steady state of friction coefficient at approximately 0. 03 and 0. 06, respectively after about 1000 rpm, but steel valve plate without coating showed a continuous decrease in friction coefficient, which suggested that active wear is continuously occurring. By applying CrZrN coating on the commercial cylinder barrel and steel valve plate, much improved tribological results could be obtained, by a factor of approximately 2 in terms of friction coefficient than those from bronze valve plate. Under a tap water environment CrZrN coating appeared to perform better than CrSiN coating. Although further work to reduce the friction coefficient below 0. 13 in the steady state after initial drop is still needed, possibilities of applying CrZrN coating to realize a water hydraulic pump were demonstrated through the present work...|$|R

40|$|<b>Steel</b> sheet <b>coated</b> with zinc or 55 %Al-Zn {{is widely}} used at the civil construction, mainly for roofing and {{cladding}} applications. The 55 %Al-Zn <b>coated</b> <b>steel</b> shows mechanical properties slightly different from zinc <b>coated</b> <b>steel,</b> even under the same heat cycle processing, due to the higher molten metal temperature and also to the higher strength of the 55 %Al-Zn coating.

Although those two coated products are widely used at the civil construction in Brazil, only a limited literature is available on the difference between the mechanical properties of those products. Through tensile tests of commercial grade samples - as coated and after removing the coating - the aim {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the mechanical properties (tensile strength, yield strength, total elongation and hardening coefficient) and also how much the coating influences the mechanical properties of the zinc and 55 %Al-Zn <b>coated</b> <b>steel.</b> The 55 %Al-Zn <b>coated</b> <b>steel</b> showed higher yield and tensile strength and lower total elongation and hardening coefficient compared to zinc <b>coated</b> <b>steel</b> and the <b>coating</b> showed a significant influence on the mechanical properties of both products...|$|R

40|$|We {{outline the}} ability of zinc {{phosphate}} coatings, obtained by chemical conversion, to protect mild steel rebars against localized corrosion, generated by chloride ions in alkaline media. The corrosion resistance of <b>coated</b> <b>steel,</b> in comparison with uncoated rebars and <b>coated</b> and uncoated <b>steel</b> rebars embedded in mortar, were evaluated by open-circuit potential, potentiodynamic polarization, cronoamperometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The coated surfaces were characterized by x-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. First, <b>coated</b> mild <b>steel</b> rebars were studied in an alkaline solution with and without chloride simulating a concrete pore solution. The {{results showed that the}} slow dissolution of the coating generates hydroxyapatite Ca 10 (PO 4) 6 (OH) 2. After a long immersion, the coating became dense and provided an effective corrosion resistance compared with the mild steel rebar.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work is to {{investigate}} the possibility of improving corrosion resistance of the galvanic coupling of steel and zinc by <b>coating</b> <b>steel</b> {{with a layer of}} polyaniline (PANi) conducting polymer. The galvanostatic technique was used for forming the PANi layer using a potentiostat (EG&G A- 273 Potentiostat/Galvanostat). Many variables were investigated for their effect on the characteristics of the formed coat layer such as: applied current density, aniline monomer concentration, and solution pH. The formed coat layer was investigated using X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). Finally the corrosion resistance ability of the galvanic coupling of PANi <b>coated</b> <b>steel</b> coupled with zinc was investigated using the electrochemical methods such as Tafel method. The results show that the corrosion rate of the galvanic coupling of PANi <b>coated</b> <b>steel</b> and zinc has been decreased by a factor ranging from 1. 4 up to 1. 51 than the coupling without coat, depending on the operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Zinc <b>coated</b> <b>steels</b> are {{nowadays}} {{used for}} different applications as for example for household appliances, automotive or offtakes. Due to the boiling temperature of zinc (907 °C), which {{is lower than}} the steel melting point, the welding of zinc <b>coated</b> <b>steel</b> sheets presents many difficulties. As a result of the violent evaporation of zinc, pores in the weld seam are present after solidification and the zinc coating near the weld is damaged. Brazing of zinc <b>coated</b> <b>steels</b> with CuSi-alloys offers some advantages, as the joining temperature is about 950 - 1000 °C. Nevertheless the high melting point of these filler materials requires very restricted process strategies and damaging of the zinc coating near the brazing seam can’t be avoided. Although laser-, plasma- and MIG-joining with CuSi and CuAl are performed nowadays. ZnAl-alloys are characterized through low melting temperature, which are comparable to the melting point of zinc, so that the damaging of the zinc coating can be reduced. In this paper investigations carried out with ZnAl-materials for joining zinc <b>coated</b> <b>steel</b> sheets as DC 04 ZE 75 / 75 and DX 56 Z (thickness 0, 9 mm) are reported. First investigations were performed by resistance spot soldering and show that using low temperature melting materials leads to a lower damaging of the zinc coating. Further the process reliability of laser soldering with ZnAl-alloys and a Nd:YAG as well as a diode laser is reported and confirms the suitability of these alloys for a damaging free joining zinc <b>coated</b> <b>steels.</b> The low surface tension leads to a wide bearing section, so that advantageous properties are expected. The mechanical properties of edge welds are evaluated in this paper through tensile tests as well...|$|R
