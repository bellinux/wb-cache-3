5|$|Alprazolam is metabolized in the liver, {{mostly by}} the enzyme {{cytochrome}} P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Two major metabolites are produced: 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam, {{as well as}} an inactive benzophenone. The low concentrations and low potencies of 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam indicate that they have <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>no</b> contribution to the effects of alprazolam.|$|E
50|$|HGF {{may also}} be caused by {{unwanted}} side effects of pharmacological agents like phenytoin, ciclosporin, and some calcium-channel blockers, meaning HGF is a disease that can be drug-induced. However, there is <b>little</b> next <b>to</b> <b>no</b> research done in this area to support the claim.|$|R

5|$|Besides poets, at {{high school}} Lewis met Sophie Carson, who {{eventually}} became his wife. Klein, their mutual friend, introduced them. Carson came from a religious Jewish family.

5|$|Exercise {{appears to}} be useful for {{preventing}} low back pain. Exercise is also probably effective in preventing recurrences in those with pain that has lasted more than six weeks. Medium-firm mattresses are more beneficial for chronic pain than firm mattresses. There is <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>no</b> evidence that back belts are any more helpful in preventing low back pain than education about proper lifting techniques. Shoe insoles do not help prevent low back pain.|$|E

5|$|The low status of—and {{subsequent}} discrimination against—women in India can {{be attributed}} to many cultural norms. Societal forces of patriarchy, hierarchy and multigenerational families contribute to Indian gender roles. Men use greater privileges and superior rights to create an unequal society that leaves women with <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>no</b> power. This societal structure is exemplified with women’s low participation within India’s national parliament and the labour force.|$|E

By {{the beginning of}} August, the North Korean units operating in the area were getting <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>no</b> food and ammunition supply, instead relying on captured UN weapons and foraging for what they could find. They were also exhausted from over a month of advancing, though morale remained high among the 766th troops. The 766th Regiment specialized in raiding UN supply lines, and effectively mounted small disruptive attacks against UN targets to equip themselves.|$|E

Lakefront Station is a modern station located in downtown Cleveland near the Lake Erie waterfront, adjacent to the Cleveland Memorial Shoreway and {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Great Lakes Science Center, the Steamship William G.

Io has {{the least amount of}} water of any known body in the Solar System. This lack of water is likely due to Jupiter being hot enough early {{in the evolution of the}} Solar System to drive off volatile materials like water in the vicinity of Io, but not hot enough to do so farther out.|$|E
5|$|Dolly {{weakened}} as it accelerated northeastward, {{although it}} still threatened to strike Bermuda with strong winds.

After continued weakening, Dolly passed over the island on September11, producing only gale-force winds, rains, and <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>no</b> damage. It deteriorated into a tropical storm on September12 and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone later that day. The remnants of Dolly later turned eastward, dissipating just west of Portugal on September17.|$|E

What is more, the value might be doubled if the catch were to be handled carefully. The fact is that, although they appear very tough, the periwinkle are in some ways delicate animals and rough treatment kills many of them. An important fact in the periwinkle industry is that the resource is a natural one which costs <b>little</b> <b>to</b> exploit. <b>No</b> equipment is required to harvest them because they are simply picked by hand when the tide is out...|$|R

5|$|Doors and vents {{often had}} sills of {{carefully}} ground flat stone slabs and lintels constructed from {{a row of}} thin wood beams. Chacoan masons also frequently included intramural beams – horizontal logs completely enclosed in the wall core – which were probably intended to reduce horizontal deformation of the wall. The interior walls of great houses were typically covered in a rock veneer. Judd identified four distinct types, and his typology is the most commonly accepted in the region. Chetro Ketl's interior walls, particularly those in the eastern wing, were covered in a Type IV veneer characterized by uniform pieces of sandstone with <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>no</b> exposed mortar. Judd excluded a fifth type of masonry, called McElmo style, from his typology.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, Charles H.

Known as kinesthetic control, and similar in principle to the mechanics of riding a bicycle or a surfboard, it was hoped that the concept would allow for pilots to operate an aircraft with <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>no</b> training time. NACA testing proved that the idea had merit, and several companies, including Bensen Aircraft, Hiller Aircraft, and de Lackner Helicopters, began development of rotorcraft using the concept.|$|E
