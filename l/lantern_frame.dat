6000|$|... "Ma said--Ow, what's that?" [...] cried Betty with a start, as {{something}} bumped against the gate outside; {{and in a}} moment Ben's head peeped over the top as he swung himself up to the iron arch, in the middle of which was the empty <b>lantern</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Randa and Katy {{stood on}} one side, {{all in their}} best, bobbing delighted courtesies; Mr. Brown, half hidden behind the gate on the other side, was keeping Sancho erect, {{so that he might}} present arms {{promptly}} when the bride appeared. As flowers were scarce, on either post stood a rosy little girl clapping her hands, while out from the thicket of red and yellow boughs, which made a grand bouquet in the <b>lantern</b> <b>frame,</b> came Ben's head and shoulders, as he waved his grandest flag with its gold paper [...] "Welcome Home!" [...] on a blue ground.|$|E
60|$|Having {{rattled off}} the {{familiar}} speech in Mr. Smithers's elegant manner, Ben begin to cut up such capers {{that even a}} party of dignified hens, going down the avenue to bed, paused to look on with clucks of astonishment, evidently fancying that salt had set him to fluttering and tumbling as it did them. Never had the old gate beheld such antics, though it had seen gay doings in its time; for of all the boys who had climbed over it, not one had ever stood on his head upon each of the big balls which ornamented the posts, hung by his heels from the arch, gone round and round like a wheel with the bar for an axis, played a tattoo with his toes while holding on by his chin, walked about the wall on his hands, or closed the entertainment by festooning himself in an airy posture {{over the side of}} the <b>lantern</b> <b>frame,</b> and kissing his hand to the audience as a well-bred Cupid is supposed to do on making his bow.|$|E

50|$|The chapel {{is located}} at the eastern end of the Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio. From the {{exterior}} it is a compact cubic brick building with a lower-roofed, projecting square apse. The main body of the chapel is surmounted by a dome with sloping tiled roof supporting a high <b>lantern,</b> <b>framed</b> by four turrets. The dome of the apse is protected by an octagonal structure, again capped with a tiled roof.|$|R
50|$|Raw cotton bales were {{unloaded}} from carts at {{the ground}} floor loading bay. The opening and cleaning machines broke the bales down and prepared the cotton into 'lap' form which {{was taken to the}} third and fourth floor carding rooms, housing three rows of carding engines, over 130. Carding machines disentangle the cotton fibres to produce a long continuous 'sliver'. Sixteen drawing <b>frames,</b> sometimes called <b>lantern</b> <b>frames,</b> straightened the fibres and pulled the 'slivers' into 'rovings' putting in a slight twist so they were ready for spinning. The rovings were coiled into large cans which were taken to the first and second floor.|$|R
50|$|Richard Arkwright was a hard-nosed {{businessman}} from Preston. Arkwright {{produced a}} {{continuous spinning machine}} that was unlike Hargreaves hand operated spinning jenny. The jenny required two motions, one to draw {{and the other to}} spin and wind. Arkwrights frame spun and wound {{at the same time and}} was operated by turning a wheel. The prototype that was powered by hand, was patented in 1769. The process was particular suitable to the application of power which in those times meant a water wheel. Arkwright developed the principle into an industrial machine where a pair of frames would have 96 spindles. In searching for a reliable source of power Arkwright set up his first factory on Cromford, on the River Derwent in Derbyshire. In 1775, he filed a patents for powered preparatory machines that would card and scutch the roving needed by the waterframe. The <b>lantern</b> <b>frame,</b> to draw the roving, and development of the waterframe known as a throstle followed.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the front}} of these stages, was placed ... a large <b>lantern</b> <b>framed</b> {{circular}} {{at the top and}} covered with paper. Behind his lantern was placed an effigy of the pope sitting in an armed Chair. Immediately behind him was the imaginary representation of the Devil, standing Erect with extended arms ... The large Effigies had heads placed on poles which went thro' the bodies & thro' {{the upper part of the}} stages which were formed like large boxes, some of them not less than 16 or 18 feet long, 3 or 4 feet wide and 3 or 4 feet in depth. Inside of the Stages and out of sight sat a boy under each effigy whose business it was to move the heads of the Effigies by means of the poles ... from one side to the other as fancy directed.|$|R
50|$|Dedicated by the Earl Mountbatten on 12 April 1966, Speakers' Corner in Regina, Saskatchewan {{is located}} on the north shore of Wascana Lake. It serves as a {{constant}} reminder of the notion of free speech and assembly and a tribute to Saskatchewan people who have upheld that heritage. The two <b>lanterns</b> <b>framing</b> the south entrance to the main plaza formed part of the Cumberland Screen at the entrance to Speakers' Corner in London. The podia on the main plaza are from the exterior columns of the Old City Hall (1908-1965) and symbolise free speech in democracy at the municipal level of government. Six paper birch trees were taken from Runnymede Meadow in Windsor Great Park, near Windsor Castle. It was there that King John signed Magna Carta on 15 June 1215. The ten gas lamps surrounding the corner come from King Charles Street which runs from Whitehall to St. James Park, London, near the Houses of Parliament. They were erected in 1908 during the reign of Edward VII, whose royal cypher E.R. VII appears on the base of each lamp.|$|R
50|$|There {{is reason}} to doubt the stories of Miz Nora, as she was called, because among other stories, she told of leading her family's covered wagon through the woods at night with a <b>lantern.</b> The time <b>frame</b> she gave for this would have her being {{about two or three}} years old at most, {{considering}} her stated birthday. Miz Nora, for reasons no one really knows, postdated the first edition of The Wiregrass Farmer and Stockman to 1899 in subsequent editions of the paper by changing its volume number. It is believed that Lawrence's religious paper was published in 1899, and she included those editions as part of The Wiregrass Farmer.|$|R
50|$|The entire {{space has}} a flat {{panelled}} fibrous cement ceiling with timber cover strips. Some panels feature lattice vents and pressed metal ceiling roses. A large skylight positioned on the axis between two posts illuminates {{the centre of}} the space. The sides of the skylight, lined similarly to the ceiling, slope inwards towards the top and terminate in the windows of the roof <b>lantern.</b> The timber <b>framed</b> pine floor is covered in carpet squares. The store retains many original timber shop fittings, including shelving units, timber counters and display cabinets. A skillion roofed extension, timber framed and clad in fibrous cement, has been built onto {{the back of the store}} near the south west corner.|$|R
50|$|By {{the late}} thirteenth century more daringly ornate styles of tracery were tried - the {{so-called}} Decorated, dating from 1290-1350. Initially geometric, using circles {{as well as}} the two point arch, it derived from the French Rayonnant style. However, it slowly became more daring and flowing; the name curvilinear has been ascribed to it. Windows became larger, increasing the number of mullions (the vertical bars dividing {{the main part of the}} window) between the lights; above them, within the arch of the window, the tracery was formed using shapes styled 'daggers' and 'mouchettes', trefoils and quadrifoils; completely circular rose windows were made, incorporating all manner of shapes. More formal reticulated (netlike) tracery can also be found, as in Wells Cathedral. Exotic forms included the ogee arch, in which the curves of the arch are reversed in the upper part thus meeting at an acute angle at the apex; others included so-called Kentish tracery with its insertion of spikey points between the rounded lobes of trefoils and quatrefoils. Larger windows inevitably weakened the walls which were now supported by large exterior buttresses which came to be a feature. Columns forming the arcades within churches of this period became more slender and elegant, the foliage of the capitals more flowing. Examples of the earlier form include the choir and chapter house of Westminster Abbey and the north transept of Hereford Cathedral; later forms include the nave of York Minster. The octagon at Ely, a timber <b>framed</b> <b>lantern</b> tower over the crossing, demonstrates the adventurousness of the developed style. But it can be seen in parish churches from Snettisham and Aylsham in Norfolk to Beverly in Yorkshire and Madley in Herefordshire. There were undoubtedly many more examples but many were replaced by later developments.|$|R
