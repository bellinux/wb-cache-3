5000|$|Phyllomedusa sauvagii, {{commonly}} known as the waxy monkey tree frog, waxy monkey frog or painted-bellied tree frog is a hylid frog belonging to the subfamily of South and Central American <b>leaf</b> <b>frogs,</b> Phyllomedusinae, that inhabits the Chaco of Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and Brazil. The subfamily consists of around 50 species in three well-known genera, Phyllomedusa, Agalychnis, and Pachymedusa. The vast majority of known species, including Phyllomedusa sauvagei, belong to the genus Phyllomedusa. [...] Phyllomedusa sauvagii has adapted {{to meet the demands of}} life in the trees. It does not need to return to the ground during the mating season; rather, it lays its eggs down the middle of a leaf before folding the leaf, sandwiching the eggs inside. Its nest is attached to a branch suspended over a stream, so the hatching tadpoles drop into the water. In common with other phyllomedusines, it has physiological and behavioural adaptations to limit water loss, including reducing water loss through the skin by lipid secretions, excretion of uric acid (uricotelism), and diurnal torpor. Lipid secretions are produced in a special type of cutaneous gland, and are spread over the surface of the skin by the legs in a complex sequence of wiping movements.|$|E

40|$|The skin {{secretions}} of Neotropical phyllomedusine <b>leaf</b> <b>frogs</b> {{have proven}} to be a rich source of biologically active peptides, including antimicrobials. The major families of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) reported are the dermaseptins and phylloseptins and the minor families are the dermatoxins, phylloxins, plasticins, distinctins, and medusins. Here, we report a novel AMP of 10 amino acid residues (LRPAILVRIKamide), named balteatide, from the skin secretion of wild Peruvian purple-sided <b>leaf</b> <b>frogs,</b> Phyllomedusa baltea. Balteatide was found to exhibit a 90 % sequence identity with sauvatide, a potent myotropic peptide from the skin secretion of Phyllomedusa sauvagei. However, despite both peptides exhibiting only a single amino acid difference (I/T at position 9), sauvatide is devoid of antimicrobial activity and balteatide is devoid of myotropic activity. Balteatide was found to have differential activity against the Gram-positive bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus; the Gram-negative bacterium, Escherichia coli; and the yeast, Candida albicans, and unusual for phyllomedusine frog skin AMPs, was most potent (MIC 32 [*]mg/L) against the yeast.

40|$|The dermaseptin {{antimicrobial}} peptide family contains {{members of}} 27 – 34 amino acids in length {{that have been}} predominantly isolated from the skins/skin secretions of phyllomedusine <b>leaf</b> <b>frogs.</b> By use of a degenerate primer in Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) PCR designed to a common conserved domain within the 5 ′-untranslated regions of previously-characterized dermaseptin encoding cDNAs, two novel members of this peptide family, named dermaseptin-PD- 1 and dermaseptin-PD- 2, were identified in the skin secretion of the phyllomedusine frog, Pachymedusa dacnicolor. The primary structures of both peptides were predicted from cloned cDNAs, {{as well as being}} confirmed by mass spectral analysis of crude skin secretion fractions resulted from reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Chemically-synthesized replicates of dermaseptin-PD- 1 and dermaseptin-PD- 2 were investigated for antimicrobial activity using standard model microorganisms (Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and a yeast) and for cytotoxicity using mammalian red blood cells. The possibility of synergistic effects between the two peptides and their anti-cancer cell proliferation activities were assessed. The peptides exhibited moderate to high inhibition against the growth of the tested microorganisms and cancer cell lines with low haemolytic activity. Synergistic interaction between the two peptides in inhibiting the proliferation of Escherichia coli and human neuronal glioblastoma cell line, U 251 MG was also manifested...|$|E
40|$|The dermaseptin peptides, mainly {{derived from}} the skin {{secretions}} of Hylidae frogs, belong to a superfamily of antimicrobial peptides and exhibit diverse antimicrobial and anticancer activities with low cytotoxicity. Here, we reported a novel dermaseptin peptide, from the South American orange-legged <b>leaf</b> <b>frogs,</b> Pithecopus (Phyllomedusa) hypochondrialis, processing the shortest peptide length, namely Dermaseptin-PH. The complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding biosynthetic precursor of Dermaseptin-PH was initially identified by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR (RACE-PCR) technique from the skin secretion. The predicted primary structure was confirmed {{by a combination of}} reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and MS/MS fragmentation from the skin secretion. Chemically-synthetic Dermaseptin-PH was investigated using a range of bioactivity assessment assays to evaluate the biological activities and cytotoxicity of Dermaseptin-PH. Dermaseptin-PH inhibited the growth of Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, and pathogenic yeast Candida albicans. In addition, Dermaseptin-PH showed a broad-spectrum of anticancer activities against several cancer cell lines including MCF- 7, H 157, U 251 MG, MDA-MB- 435 S, and PC- 3. The potent antimicrobial and anticancer activities of Dermaseptin-PH make it a promising candidate in the discovery of new drugs for clinical applications, and the relatively short sequence of Dermaseptin-PH can provide new insight for the research and structural modification of new peptide drugs...|$|E

40|$|The {{taxonomy}} of many species is still {{based solely on}} phenotypic traits, which is often a pitfall for the understanding of evolutionary processes and historical biogeographic patterns, especially between closely related species due to either phenotypic conservatism or plasticity. Two widely distributed Neotropical <b>leaf</b> <b>frogs</b> from the Phyllomedusa burmeisteri species group (P. burmeisteri and Phyllomedusa bahiana) constitute a paramount example of closely related species with relatively unstable taxonomic history due to a large phenotypic variation. Herein, we analysed similar to 260 individuals from 57 localities distributed across {{the range of the}} two species to contrast individual phenotypic with an integrative phylogenetic and phylogeographic multilocus approach. We aim to clarify species limits, investigate potential undocumented diversity and examine to what extent taxonomic uncertainties could lead to misleading hypotheses on phylogeographic and interspecific hybridization patterns. Our molecular analysis supports the recognition of the two currently defined species, providing evidences for one novel and highly divergent evolutionary unit within the range of P. burmeisteri, which encompasses its type locality (Rio de Janeiro city). Spatial patterns of genetic and the colour of the hidden areas of the thigh was not congruent, varying considerably both within and between populations of both species. Genetic data showed signs of admixture between both species but do not corroborate the previously inferred wide area of introgression based on the distribution of the intermediate phenotype. Our results suggest that phenotypic variation can result from local adaptations, geographic isolation and/or evolutionary processes and, thus, cannot be used to reliably diagnose P. burmeisteri and P. bahiana. Globally, this study underscores the need of a geographical broad sampling of widespread species and the combination of molecular and phenotypic data to delineate species limits and phylogeographic patterns in species with complex taxonomy.
