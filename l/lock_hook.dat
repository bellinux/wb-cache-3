40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{outcomes}} and complications of locking or nonlocking clavicular hook plate for fixation of unstable lateral clavicle fractures. All patients with unstable Neer type II lateral clavicle fractures were operated in our hospital from January 2011 to December 2012. The included participants received either locking or nonlocking clavicular hook plate operations. Demographic data, medical records and radiographs were reviewed retrospectively. At the last follow-up, shoulder function was evaluated with Constant-Murley scoring system. Our findings suggest that <b>locking</b> clavicular <b>hook</b> plates are equally useful for treating unstable lateral clavicular fractures, but in face of complicated ones, the <b>locking</b> <b>hook</b> plate would not get more benefits than nonlocking hook plate...|$|R
50|$|Similarly, {{since the}} Shuttle landed {{at high speed}} and could not abort its landing attempt, the gear had to deploy {{reliably}} {{on the first try}} every time. The gear were unlocked and deployed by triple redundant hydraulics, with the gear doors actuated by mechanical linkages to the gear strut. If all three hydraulic systems failed to release the landing gear uplocks within one second of the release command, pyrotechnic charges automatically cut the <b>lock</b> <b>hooks</b> and a set of springs deployed the gear.|$|R

50|$|Hooks {{are very}} {{important}} tools in the arsenal of a grappler. The effective use of the feet to manipulate {{the position of the}} opponent is essential to maintaining control of one's opponent. Both in offensive and defensive situations, <b>locking</b> in <b>hooks</b> gives an advantage of more points of contact with the opponent. This in turn increases the ability to impose submissions, and the ability to avoid them.|$|R
40|$|A {{berthing}} mechanism {{especially for}} use in berthing and compliant air-tight securing between manned space vehicle and modules is disclosed. The interface is provided {{by a pair of}} annular rings, one of which is typically, mechanically attached to the vehicle and the other to the module to which it is to be docked and secured. One of the two rings is attached to a base by resilient bellows. The facing surface of one annular ring is joined to a base by a cable laced through alternating pulleys attached circumferentially so that the interface surface of that ring may be tilted to accommodate angular misalignment as the annular rings are brought into docking (berthing) contact. Interleaving guide flanges with chambered sides provide at least some rotational mialignmnet correction. A plurality of electromechanical actuator/attenuator units provide means for extending one annular ring toward the other {{in the final stages of}} docking, for absorbing the initial docking shock and for drawing the annular rings into tight interface contact. <b>Locking</b> <b>hooks</b> provide for securing the interfaces...|$|R

50|$|However, {{there has}} been a {{simultaneous}} revival in the fortunes of old-style hand-forged ironmongery, with strong interest in the authentic restoration of period homes leading to demand for items such as traditional iron door handles, door knobs, door knockers, letter plates, <b>locks,</b> hinges, <b>hooks,</b> cabinet fittings and window furniture. There has even been renewed use of “blacksmith nails” - four-sided hand-made rosehead nails. This is typical of a trend that has seen greater appreciation of designs that have stood the test of time, that has allowed hand-forged ironmongery to find a much wider application than use in property restoration - although the practice of incorporating traditional ironmongery into contemporary housing has been helped by thoroughly modern techniques like galvanising and powder coating to inhibit rust.|$|R

5000|$|The Colne is a {{river in}} England {{which is a}} {{tributary}} of the River Thames. Just over half its course is in south Hertfordshire. Downstream, the Colne is the boundary between Buckinghamshire (specifically the South Bucks district) and London (specifically the London Borough of Hillingdon) and finally between corners of Berkshire and Surrey. On leaving Hertfordshire, the watercourse splits off into several separate branches, a few of which rejoin it, and its main branch flows into the River Thames on the reach above Penton <b>Hook</b> <b>Lock</b> at Staines-upon-Thames.|$|R
40|$|One {{hundred and}} three {{patients}} with scoliosis treated by posterior fusion and Harrington instrumentation are reviewed. The fusion technique described {{does not require}} added bone. Walking in a localiser plaster is encouraged {{as soon as the}} wound is healed, usually two weeks after operation. The results compare satisfactorily with others published. It is concluded that added bone is not necessary unless neural arch defects are present, and that early walking is advantageous and without risk to the correction. In 1962 Harrington described a method of internal fixation for scoliosis which, combined with posterior fusion, has probably become the most widely practised operation for this deformity. Techniques of fusion and instrumentation, and pre-operative and post-operative management vary considerably. The regime described here is based on the following considerations.

5000|$|However, in {{traditional}} catch wrestling, hooks are used rather than submissions. Hooks are {{a form of}} submission where the submission may be executed so fast that the loser has no time to tap out & were probably derived from the Rough & Tumble mindset. Therefore, another name for a catch wrestler is a [...] "hooker." [...] A [...] "hook" [...] {{can be defined as}} an undefined move that stretches, spreads or compresses any joint or limb. Catch wrestling techniques may include, but are not limited to: the arm bar, Japanese arm bar, straight arm bar, hammerlock, bar hammerlock, wrist lock, double wrist lock, key lock (shoulder), reverse key lock (this move is also known as the Kimura in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, or the reverse Ude-Garami in judo), head scissors, body scissors, chest lock, abdominal lock, abdominal stretch, leg lock, knee bar, ankle <b>lock,</b> heel <b>hook,</b> toe hold, half Nelson, full Nelson and almost infinitely many others. Almost all moves have their own variations and different predicaments they can be pulled off in. Many of such novel techniques were a result of cross cultural exchanges with Jujutsu proponents.|$|R

Known as [...] "Vert-A-Pac", the rail cars would hold 30 Vegas in a vertical, nose-down position, versus 18 in normal tri-level autoracks. Each Vega was fitted with four removable, cast-steel sockets inserted into the undercarriage that <b>locked</b> into the <b>hooks</b> on the bottom-hinged doors that made up the car side.|$|R
