5|$|Unlike the Rouen duck, {{the other}} popular meat variety in England in the 19th century, Aylesbury ducks lay eggs from early November.

Consequently, their meat came onto the market from February onwards, after {{the close of}} the game season but before the earliest spring chickens were on sale. Rouen ducks, whose mallard-like coloration made them less valuable, lay eggs from early February and take six months to grow <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> eat. As a consequence, Aylesbury ducks were sold primarily in the spring and summer, and Rouen ducks in the autumn and winter.|$|E
5|$|A {{dust devil}} is a strong, well-formed, and {{relatively}} long-lived whirlwind, ranging from small (half a metre wide {{and a few}} metres tall) to large (more than 10 metres wide and more than 1000 metres tall).

Gpcode.AG, which was detected in June 2006, was encrypted with a 660-bit RSA public key. In June 2008, a variant known as Gpcode.AK was detected.
