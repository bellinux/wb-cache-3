40|$|Introduction: Very {{often people}} with visual {{impairment}} have lost vision gradually, but the home has not changed to accommodate the new situation. There may be a mismatch between the home features and the person&# 146;s needs. There {{is a need to}} understand the person&# 146;s needs in their environmental context in order to ascertain what rehabilitation interventions such as assistive devices and home modification will be most useful. It is anticipated that people with Age- related macular degeneration (AMD) may have a number of perspectives, experiences and suggestions which if explored will assist in greater understanding and in communicating helpful coping strategies to others. Aim: To explore the perspective and experiences of people with AMD and their service providers to understand better, what home modifications and assistive devices may be most useful with respect to visual function and functional vision. Methods: This study employed mixed research methods (both qualitative and quantitative) of data collection and analysis. In the quantitative phase, visual function was measured and the functional vision of 31 participants with AMD was assessed using the Melbourne Low Vision Index (MLVI) to characterise the sample population. In the qualitative phase, data about their experiences with home modification were obtained from in-depth semi-structured individual interview with participants with AMD and a focus group interview was conducted with service providers to find out their experiences of delivery information related to home modification for people with MD. In addition, a pilot simulation study of AMD in a normally vision person using opaque pupil soft contact lens (OPSCL) was conducted in order to understand better the impact of central vision loss on visual function and functional vision and to explain its potential usefulness as an educational tool for home modification providers. Results: This research highlights a number of key themes. First, the most useful environmental modifications, as perceived by the participants with AMD, are handrails, non-slip flooring, colour contrast, high contrast stair nosing, single <b>lever</b> <b>tap,</b> lifts, magnification devices and sensor lighting. Second, lack of knowledge about available services may reduce functional performance in some activities. There was a lack of awareness among the participants with AMD that home modification services were available and useful indicating communication of this service must be improved. Service providers reported a lack of referral and follow-up systems with regards to low vision and home modification services for people {{with visual impairment}}. Third, this research confirmed results of previous studies on older people&# 146;s home environments that found that kitchens, steps and bathrooms were the areas perceived as particularly hazardous. Fourth, this research confirm that although functional vision is largely correlated with visual function, a reduction in visual acuity alone does not necessary lead to reduction in functional vision. Last, a guideline for useful home modifications for people with AMD was developed with the perspectives of participants with AMD that may be useful for other people with visual impairment. Conclusions: First, {{there is a need to}} differentiate usefulness of vision-related environmental modifications as a strategy to help people with AMD, as there is considerable variability in environmental interventions which were regarded as useful, which may be attributable to differences in AMD severity, attitude, knowledge about AMD and home modifications, level of visual impairment and co-morbidities. Second, vision-related environmental modification information that is better targeted to these variables may also benefit a wider range and level of people with visual impairment. Last, the significance of non-visual coping strategies on older people&# 146;s ability to manage activities of daily living independently need to be addressed by the instruments that measure functional vision, as individualised adaptive strategies are not well measured by current measurement instruments...|$|E
5000|$|Westerns {{were popular}} when The Rifleman premiered, and {{producers}} {{tried to find}} gimmicks to distinguish one show from another. The Riflemans gimmick was a modified Winchester Model 1892 rifle, with a large ring <b>lever</b> drilled and <b>tapped</b> for a set screw. The lever design allowed him to cock the rifle by spinning it around his hand. In addition, the screw could be positioned to depress the trigger every time he worked the lever, allowing for rapid fire, emptying the magazine in under five seconds during the opening credits on North Forks main street.|$|R
40|$|Tap Design Review in {{emergency}} water supply A standpost {{in emergency}} situation is often made up with six different self-closing unity taps. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine which taps are most suitable in emergency situations, in order to make recommendations of use to field workers and to help constructors to review their design. To achieve these results, data via internet contacts and interviews have been collected. Afterwards, these results have been completed with a laboratory phase of comparison between taps. They have principally to fulfil the following characteristics: robustness with an affordable cost, a good discharge at very low pressure, some proprieties to avoid loss (good quality of the jet, no leakage and difficulties to tie up the tap) and no contamination hazards. Finally, this research revealed that the gravity flow taps as the “Talbot ” and the “Scat” should not be preferred because of their important contamination hazards. The recommended one would be for the moment the one used by “Médecins Sans Frontières ” (France and Belgium), produced by Aubia, a <b>lever</b> push <b>tap,</b> yet easy to tie up. Last, existing circular handle push taps are not suitable yet, but, with an improve...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, the demand for the {{introduction}} of fish products in public canteens (schools, hospitals and nursing-homes) has grown due to their good nutritional proprieties. The particular health conditions and sensitivity of some groups of consumers exposes them to greater risks of food poisoning. It is therefore important to monitor the raw materials that end up in mass catering implementing strategies of mass catering control, both with self-monitoring strategies and with regular controls performed by the competent health authorities. The {{purpose of this study}} is to assess the overall quality of seafood dealt out from public catering services located in Northeast Italy. In this paper we illustrate the results of microbiological analysis performed on 135 fish samples (58 % of samples were raw fishes, 27 % cooked fishes, 6 % raw fish products, 9 % cooked fish products) and species identification performed on 102 fish samples. Additionally, 135 environmental swabs were collected to determine the effectiveness of cleaning and sanitation of food contact (cutting boards, cooking equipment and food processing surfaces) and non-contact (refrigerator wall and handle, <b>tap</b> <b>lever)</b> surfaces. Of raw seafood samples, 24 % had total aerobic mesophilic bacteria count > 105 CFU/g and for Enterobacteriaceae the faecal contamination was excluded since no Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli were isolated. Just 3. 8 % of raw seafood samples resulted positive for Listeria monocytogenes. The results of swab samples of cooking utensils and surfaces showed that sanitation practices should be improved. Molecular analysis for fish species identification revealed a mislabelling for 25 % of sampled fishes. The results of this survey can provide valuable information for monitoring and surveillance programmes for the control of quality of fish and fish products...|$|R
