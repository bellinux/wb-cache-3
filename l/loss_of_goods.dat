25|$|By mid-December the Dowager Duchess's eldest son, William Howard, his wife, and the Duchess's {{daughter}} Anne Howard {{were committed}} to the Tower. About the same time another of the Duchess's daughters, Katherine Daubeney, Lady Bridgewater was also arrested. On 14 December 1541, Norfolk, fearful for his own safety, denounced his stepmother and kin {{in a letter to}} the King. On 22 December William Howard and his wife, and a number of servants who had been witnesses to the Queen's misconduct, including Malyn Tilney (mother of Edmund Tilney, future Master of the Revels to Queen Elizabeth), were arraigned for misprision of treason 'for concealing the evil demeanour of the Queen, to the slander of the King and his succession'. All were sentenced to life imprisonment and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> although most were pardoned after Queen Catherine's execution. The Dowager Duchess, although included in the indictment, was not brought to trial as she was 'old and testy', and 'may die out of perversity to defraud the King's Highness of the confiscation of her goods', but like the others she was sentenced to imprisonment and forfeiture of lands and goods.|$|E

[...] Their work devised a quantitative framework for analyzing the effect of strikes on the various parties involved {{as well as on the}} general public, making use of reliable figures when available and forming imprecise judgments when not, then sought to evaluate seventeen recent strikes in the coal, rail, and steel industries in these terms. [...] They also made public policy recommendations regarding when government intervention should be undertaken, saying that such action must take into effect the loss of income for producers as well as the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services for consumers. [...] The second of these books became one of Chamberlain's works to be translated into other languages, in this case Japanese.|$|E

6000|$|Of course Friedrich now pushes on, double speed; detaches other force, {{horse and}} foot: which was lucky, says my informant; for the Ziethen Hussars, getting good plunder, had {{by no means}} {{demolished}} the Saxons; but had left them time to draw up in firm order, with a hedge in front, a little west of the Village;--from which post, unassailable by Ziethen, they would have got safe off to the main body, with little but an affront and some <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods.</b> The new force--a rapid Katzler with light horse in the van, cuirassiers and foot rapidly following him--sweeps past the long Village, [...] "through a thin wood and a defile;" [...] finds the enemy firmly ranked as above said; cavalry their left, infantry on right, flanked by an impenetrable hedge; and at once strikes in. At once, Katzler does, on order given; but is far too weak. Charges, he; but is counter-charged, tumbled back; the Saxons, horse and foot, showing excellent fight. At length, more Prussian force coming up, cuirassiers charge them in front, dragoons in flank, hussars in rear; all attacking at once, and with a will; and the poor Saxon Cavalry is entirely cut to shreds.|$|E
60|$|Yea, further, that {{we should}} have now at last in reserve Christ as {{authorized}} to be our Advocate to plead for us; for this is the last of his offices for us while we are here, and is to be put in practice for us when there are more than ordinary occasions.

6000|$|When we had {{examined}} {{those wonderful}} remains of antiquity, the marble huts, and admired the orange trees, the vines and fruits which thrive like weeds in this marvellous soil and climate, we descended {{to the next}} platform, and saw the farming operations in full swing. I {{think that it was}} the best farm I have ever seen in Africa. There was ample water for purposes of irrigation, the grass lands below gave pasturage for hundreds of head of cattle and horses, and, for natives, the people were most industrious. Moreover, the whole place was managed by Mr. Carson on the co-operative system; he only took a tithe of the produce--indeed, in this land of teeming plenty, what was he to do with more? Consequently the tribesmen, who, by the way, called themselves the [...] "Children of Thomas," [...] were able to accumulate considerable wealth. All their disputes were referred to their [...] "father," [...] and he also was judge of offences and crimes. Some were punished by imprisonment, whipping, and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> other and graver transgressions by expulsion from the community, a fiat which to one of these favoured natives must have seemed as heavy as the decree that drove Adam from the Garden of Eden.|$|E
6000|$|Conclusion Fourth, Another {{thing that}} followeth from the words is this; namely, That when {{the devil and}} wicked men have done what they could, in their persecuting of the godly; they have yet had their souls at their own dispose. 11 They {{have not been able}} to rob them of their souls, they are not able to hurt their souls. The soul is not in their power to touch, without the leave of God, and of him whose soul it is. [...] "And fear not them," [...] saith Christ, [...] "which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul" [...] (Matt 10:28). This, I say, lies clear also in the text; for the exhortation supposes, that {{whatever}} the sufferers, there made mention of, had lost, they had yet their souls at their own dispose. Let them that suffer, even to the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> liberty, or life, [...] "commit the keeping of their souls to God." [...] As, who should say, though the enemy hath reached them to their all, and stripped them of their all, yet I know, that their soul is not among that all: For their soul is yet free from them, at liberty, and may be disposed of, even as the sufferer will. Wherefore, let him commit the keeping of his soul to God, lest he also through his negligence or carelessness be also spoiled of that. The sufferer, therefore, hath his soul at his own dispose, he may give that away to God Almighty, in spite of all that the devil and the world can do. He may, indeed, see men parting his land, his household stuff, yea, his very raiment among themselves, but they cannot so dispose of his soul.12 They [...] "have no more that they can do" [...] (Luke 12:4).|$|E
