2500|$|There {{are four}} basic forms of {{bifurcation}} associated with loss of structural stability or buckling {{in the case}} of structures with a single degree of freedom. [...] These comprise two types of pitchfork bifurcation, one saddle-node bifurcation (often referred to as a limit point) and one transcritical bifurcation. The pitchfork bifurcations are the most commonly studied forms and include the buckling of columns, sometimes known as Euler buckling; the buckling of plates, sometimes known as <b>local</b> <b>buckling,</b> which is well known to be relatively safe (both are supercritical phenomena) and the buckling of shells, which is well-known to be a highly dangerous (subcritical phenomenon). Using the concept of potential energy, equilibrium is defined as a stationary point with respect to the degree(s) of freedom of the structure. We can then determine whether the equilibrium is stable, as in the case where the stationary point is a local minimum; or unstable, as in the case where the stationary point is a maximum point of inflection or saddle point (for multiple-degree-of-freedom structures only) – see animations below.|$|E

These buckling modes depend on material properties other than stiffness and density, so the stiffness-over-density-cubed metric {{is at best}} {{a starting point for}} analysis. For example, most wood species score better than most metals on this metric, but many metals can be formed into useful beams with much thinner walls than could be achieved with wood, given wood's greater vulnerability to <b>local</b> <b>buckling.</b> The performance of thin-walled beams can also be greatly modified by relatively minor variations in geometry such as flanges and stiffeners.|$|E
40|$|Rupture of {{the pipe}} wall and {{inadmissible}} deformations are the two basic failure modes that can he distinguished in pipelines. Rupture can {{be the result of}} (a) the fact that the experienced strains exceed the strain capacity {{of the pipe}} wall, including less ductile zones in and near the weids and (b) high cycle and/or low cycle fatigue loading. Examples of inadmissible deformations are collapse, <b>local</b> <b>buckles</b> and excessive ovalizations. Deformations caused hy external loads like earth pressure and imposed hending in settlement areas do not affect the burst pressure (failure mode rupture), provided that the pipe wall has sufficient strain capacity. If the strains in <b>local</b> <b>buckles</b> do not exceed the strain capacity, then <b>local</b> <b>buckles</b> do not affect the hurst pressure either. The paper summarizes the theory to support this. Burst test results on pipes with external loads and with <b>local</b> <b>buckles</b> are presented. These tests have demonstrated that if ductility is good, even extremely deep huckles do not affect hurst pressure. Results of finite element calculations to simulate the kending and local huckling hehaviour are presented as well.

However, <b>local</b> <b>buckles</b> in the plastic hinge region are major hindrances for the ductility capability and stability of the structural system. Thus, the research program aims to mitigate such inelastic instabilities by using glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP), which possesses elastic modulus roughly one order of magnitude less than that of steel. On the other hand, this elastic modulus discrepancy between GFRP and steel can be useful for stabilizing <b>local</b> <b>buckles</b> by means of the bracing effect of GFRP during plastic hinge formations. This thesis describes large-scale experimental study of the research program that investigates the seismic behavior of steel I-beams reinforced with GFRP. In this experimental study, four HE 400 AA beams with welded haunch (WH) modification and three HE 500 AA beams with no modification were tested under cyclic loading. The results of experimental study indicate that it does not seem possible to rely on GFRP reinforcement to increase the flexural resistance of connections at a rotation of 0. 04 radians because the adhesive layer between steel and GFRP fails in rotations much lower than 0. 04 radians. However, the seismic performance of the structure can be moderately improved with the bottom flange WH and GFRP reinforcement in order to maintain rotations without <b>local</b> <b>buckles</b> in accordance with the rotation demand of IMFs, which is 0. 02 radians...|$|R

Cold-formed steel allowed for shapes which differed greatly from the classical hot-rolled shapes. The material was easily workable; it could be deformed into many possible shapes.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive investigation on <b>local</b> web <b>buckling</b> mechanism {{and design of}} double-coped beam connections. Following a careful validation study, a series of finite element (FE) models are established, covering a spectrum of geometric and material variables including cope length, cope depth, web slenderness, and steel grade. The study reveals that the main failure mode of the models is either inelastic or elastic <b>local</b> web <b>buckling,</b> and the considered parameters can evidently influence the buckling capacity. The models with short copes tend to fail by inelastic buckling accompanied by excessive shear yielding. For the models with long copes, especially for those with thin webs and high steel grades, stable post-buckling equilibrium path could be sustained after the occurrence of initial buckling, {{and as a result}} the ultimate reaction can be evidently higher than that governed by elastic buckling. In addition, stress concentration is significant near the cope corners, and the peak elastic stress concentration factor (SCF) could achieve around 2. 0. A further discussion is made on various support and boundary conditions, and these variables are also shown to have clear influences on the <b>local</b> web <b>buckling</b> capacity of double-coped beams. Based on the numerical results, and recognising the potential limitations of the existing design rule, a modified design method, taking account of the various influential factors revealed in this study, is finally proposed.

In the models of LDM, cracking or <b>local</b> <b>buckling</b> as well as plasticity are lumped at the inelastic hinges. As in continuum damage mechanics, LDM uses state variables to represent the effects of damage on the remaining stiffness and strength of the frame structure.

In the latter case, concepts such as the energy release rate or the stress intensity factor of a plastic hinge are introduced.

The study commenced {{with a series}} of full-scale tests on 11 specimens, covering a spectrum of cope lengths and cope depths. <b>Local</b> web <b>buckling</b> was observed as the main failure mode for most specimens. The ultimate load was found to decrease with increasing coped length and cope depth, and in addition, an increase of the rotational stiffness of the beam end connection could benefit the <b>local</b> web <b>buckling</b> capacity. A numerical study was subsequently performed enabling further interpretation of the test results. Good agreements were observed between the test results and finite element analysis predictions, and the stress conditions within the coped web panel at different loading stages were fully revealed. The numerical study also showed that the ultimate loads of some models were not sensitive to initial imperfection amplitudes, especially when the cope length was large (i. e. 450 mm or longer). It was believed that the imperfection insensitivity characteristic was due to the presence of post-buckling mechanism.
