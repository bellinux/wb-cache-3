5|$|On November24, 2004, the {{day before}} Thanksgiving, 2,000 Teamsters Union {{employees}} went on strike, after contract negotiations failed. This was the first strike {{in the history of}} the roadway. As this is usually one of the busiest traffic days in the United States, to avoid traffic jams, tolls were waived for the rest of the day. Starting on November25, turnpike management personnel collected flat-rate passenger tolls of $2 and commercial tolls of $15 from cash customers on the ticketed system, while E-ZPass customers were charged the <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> the actual toll or the same flat rates. The strike ended after seven days when both sides reached an agreement on November30. Normal toll collection resumed December1.|$|E
5|$|Smith invented Sartorias-deles as {{a fantasy}} world that {{gradually}} became populated by humans {{over a number}} of centuries; these new arrivals were influenced by the world's indigenous beings enough to better themselves, largely eradicating societal problems like disease and overpopulation. She originally wrote Crown Duel as a twenty-year-old, and when she returned to rewrite the story later in life, she sought to maintain the story from Mel's young perspective. As a result, the novel's intended audience are young adults. As Smith's most popular YA novel, both parts of Crown Duel received generally positive reviews. Reviews of the 1997 publication of Crown Duel highlight the character of Mel and Smith's worldbuilding as positive elements. Critics assessed Court Duel as generally the <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> the two.|$|E

25|$|The cap is {{actively}} policed and penalties for clubs {{found to have}} breached the NRL salary cap regulations include fines of <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> half the amount involved or $500,000 and/or deduction of premiership points. For example, six clubs were fined for minor infractions in 2003. These infractions are usually technical in nature, and can sometimes be affected by third-party factors such as loss of sponsorship revenue affecting an allowance. During the 2007 season the NRL implemented ways of creating a fair and more beneficial cap for players and clubs.|$|E
25|$|The {{constituency}} {{is named}} after the River Itchen, which flows through it and is the <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> the two major rivers that reach the tidal estuary of Southampton Water at the city. Although until the 1970s it was a safe Labour seat, it elected a Conservative MP, Christopher Chope in 1983 and 1987 after the sitting MP Bob Mitchell left Labour in 1981 for the SDP. The combination of Mitchell as a strong SDP-Liberal Alliance candidate in both 1983 and 1987, together with Conservative landslides, made Southampton Itchen highly competitive.|$|E

As the war went on, however, Indonesians were dismayed by the austerity of wartime rationing and by increasingly harsh measures taken by the Japanese military.

25|$|Emley added {{floodlights}} {{to their}} facilities in 1981, when these were quite rare for non-league clubs at that level. This paid off when floodlights became compulsory for {{clubs in the}} Northern Counties East League Premier Division. They initially finished around mid-table. Michael Pamment, who scored a record 305 goals for the club, took over as manager in 1978, and served until 1985. Under his reign Emley finished in third place and a later a runners up spot in 1985–86. At this time Emley entered the FA Vase rather than the trophy.

25|$|Germany {{understood}} that the region would not be re-attached. Therefore, they favored the <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> two evils and tacitly supported the interests of Lithuania. The Weimar Republic saw both Poland and France as its major enemies while Lithuania was more neutral. Also, once Germany restored its might, {{it would be much}} easier to recapture the region from weaker Lithuania than from larger Poland. Already on February 22, 1922, the Germans unofficially informed the Lithuanians that they were not opposed to Lithuanian action in Klaipėda and that, understandably, such a stance would never be officially declared. Such attitudes were later confirmed in other unofficial German–Lithuanian communications and even during the revolt, when Berlin urged local Germans not to hinder the Lithuanian plans.|$|E
25|$|After the {{oil shock}} the NUM renewed its claim for a {{substantial}} wage increase, a claim which broke government pay guidelines, and then began industrial action {{in the form of}} an overtime ban in support of the claim. The sudden shortage of coal in the middle of the winter forced the Government to announce a 'three-day week' of restrictions of electricity by industry. Adamson deplored the move but regarded it as the <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> two evils because industry might not be able to operate at all. Adamson supported the Government's refusal to concede the miners' pay claim because of concerns that other wage claims would follow, although he conceded that it could be supported if there was a watertight guarantee that other unions would settle within the limits.|$|E
25|$|Rank {{and status}} are fixed from birth. There {{is no way}} in Tongan society to climb up in rank. A low ranking chief will always remain the <b>lesser</b> <b>of</b> a high ranking chief, even though his lands may be bigger and richer and so forth. But he can try to marry a high ranking woman, for {{instance}} if she is interested in his rich lands, and so increase the rank of his children. Status on the other hand, although usually fixed too, can have some vertical movement. The second son of a noble, normally not in line for his father's title, may get it after all if his older brother dies prematurely. In addition to this sometimes, but very rarely, the king may elevate some person to high status.|$|E
