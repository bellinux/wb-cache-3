A debt is a sum due, and its quantity is a monetary sum, easily ascertained by drawing up an account. By contrast a liability {{will need to be}} quantified, as for instance, with a claim for a breach of contract and unliquidated damages. The balance sheet test asks whether [...] "the value of the company's assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities." [...] This, whether total assets are less than liabilities, may also be taken into account for the purpose of the same rules as the cash flow test (a winding up order, administration, and voidable transactions). But it is also the only test used for the purpose of the wrongful trading rules, and director disqualification. These rules potentially impose liability upon directors as a response to creditors being paid. This makes the balance sheet relevant, because if creditors are in fact all paid, the rationale for imposing liability on directors (assuming there is no fraud) drops away. Contingent and prospective liabilities refer to liability of a company that arise when an event takes place (e.g., defined as a contingency under a surety contract) or <b>liabilities</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>arise</b> in future (e.g., probable claims by tort victims). The method for computing assets and liabilities depends on accountancy practice. These practices may legitimately vary. However, the law's general requirement is that accounting for assets and liabilities must represent a [...] "true and fair view" [...] of the company's finances. The final approach to insolvency is found under the Employment Rights Act 1996 section 183(3), which gives employees a claim for unpaid wages from the National Insurance fund. Mainly for the purpose of certainty of an objectively observable event, for these claims to arise, a company must have entered winding up, a receiver or manager must be appointed, or a voluntary arrangement must have been approved. The main reason employees have access to the National Insurance fund is that they bear significant risk that their wages will not be paid, given their place in the statutory priority queue.|$|E

5000|$|Occupiers' {{liability}} is a {{field of}} tort law, codified in statute, which concerns the duty of care owed by those who occupy real property, through ownership or lease, to people who visit or trespass. It deals with <b>liability</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>arise</b> from accidents caused by the defective or dangerous condition of the premises. In English law, occupiers' liability towards visitors is regulated in the Occupiers' Liability Act 1957. In addition, occupiers' liability to trespassers is provided under the Occupiers' Liability Act 1984. Although the law largely codified the earlier common law, {{the difference between a}} [...] "visitor" [...] and a [...] "trespasser", and the definition of an [...] "occupier" [...] continue to rely on cases for their meaning.|$|R

On the one hand, the analysis centers on internationally wrongful acts carried out by relief personnel and uncertainties related to the attribution of conduct, due to the array of actors involved in such missions. Such an examination {{will be carried out}} through the lens of draft articles adopted by the International Law Commission on the responsibility of states and international organizations where some non-exhaustive references are made to such scenarios. On the other hand, the Article focuses on <b>liability</b> issues <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>arise</b> in relief operations, with a specific analysis on claims involving private third parties and solutions provided by disaster law documents in this area. However, this practice is far from being uniform and several shortcomings can be identified, thus increasing the need for relevant actors to properly address such issues avoiding the current shortsighted attitude...|$|R

The network connections form a subnet where the router has the static IP address {{visible to the}} outside world and the server along with the robots form a subnet with local IP addresses. Often however, each robot has its own static IP address. In addition, each robot has a NIC card and a unique NIC address, as well as other hardware identifiers depending on the functionality and complexity of the robot. The non-electronic part of the robot hardware usually represents mature technology that has been understood for a long time. The electronic hardware has evolved {{to the point that the}} embedded software can provide the needed intelligence for the robot to perform sophisticated tasks previously performed by one or more human beings. However, in previous research emphasis has been placed on the tasks performed by the robots, neglecting any security issues or <b>liabilities</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>arise</b> due to lack of security. In this paper, we provide an algorithm for secure key management, and secure communication in an insecure wireless and noisy environment in which the robots operate...|$|E

In the last few decades, violations of aviation security have included acts of sabotage, bombings and bomb threats and the unlawful seizure and total destruction of aircraft in flight. Great efforts have been taken at the national and international levels to increase and standardize security measures at airports throughout the world. The fact remains, however, that even the most stringent security requirements have not been able to guard against all possible attacks. This thesis explores the private law <b>liability</b> issues <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>arise</b> from branches of the duty to secure airports and aircraft. The focus is on providing a global view of the principles governing suits against the two most likely defendants [...] the air carrier and the government [...] and on the policy options which could underpin civil liability. The perspective is Canadian in that it presumes that either a Canadian airport or Canadian airline has been involved in the terrorist attack...|$|R
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Thesis (M. S.) : Bilkent University, Department of Computer Engineering, İhsan Doğramacı Bilkent University, 2017. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 55 - 59). In this work, we address the <b>liability</b> issues <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>arise</b> due to unauthorized sharing of personal data. We consider a {{scenario in which}} an individual shares his sequential data (such as genomic data or location patterns) with several service providers (SPs). In such a scenario, if his data is shared with other third parties without his consent, the individual wants to determine the service provider {{that is responsible for}} this unauthorized sharing. To provide this functionality, we propose a novel optimization-based watermarking scheme for sharing of sequential data. Thus, {{in the case of an}} unauthorized sharing of sensitive data, the proposed scheme can nd the source of the leakage by checking the watermark inside the leaked data. In particular, the proposed schemes guarantees with a high probability that (i) the SP that receives the data cannot understand the watermarked data points, (ii) when more than one SPs aggregate their data, they still cannot determine the watermarked data points, (iii) even if the unauthorized sharing involves only a portion of the original data, the corresponding SP can be kept responsible for the leakage, and (iv) the added watermark is compliant with the nature of the corresponding data. That is, if there are inherent correlations in the data, the added watermark still preserves such correlations. Watermarking typically means changing certain parts of the data, and hence it may have negative e ects on data utility. The proposed scheme also minimizes such utility loss while it provides the aforementioned security guarantees. Furthermore, we conduct a case study of the proposed scheme on genomic data and show the security and utility guarantees of the proposed scheme. by Arif Yılmaz. M. S...|$|R
