Nonlinear Static Pushover Analysis is one {{of several}} methods for seismic {{performance}} evaluation of structures. It can evaluate the strength of the structure until its performance level. It can also provide reasonable estimates of the location of the plastic hinge of the members. The performance point of structure in Nonlinear Static Pushover Analysis depends on the <b>lateral</b> <b>load</b> pattern applied on the structure. In this study, a 6 story regular building is subjected to two <b>lateral</b> <b>load</b> patterns recommended by FEMA 273. The first <b>lateral</b> <b>load</b> pattern is uniform distribution and the second is equivalent lateral force distribution. The result of the analysis shows that both applied <b>lateral</b> <b>load</b> patterns give the performance of building located between IO-LS level. For both applied <b>lateral</b> <b>load</b> patterns show the similar plastic hinge order, starts from beam end and continues to beam end of the higher story. For both <b>lateral</b> <b>load</b> patterns, the plastic hinge limited to D-E level. In general, the two <b>lateral</b> <b>load</b> patterns give the close result. The structure is safe for both applied <b>lateral</b> <b>load</b> patterns. The target displacement or maximum displacement of the building is 0. 08 m. The maximum base shear of the building due to EX is 6432. 0498 kN at 0. 0629 m. The maximum base shear of the building due to EY is 8252. 8213 kN at 0. 1874 m.

The structural design of 7World Trade Center therefore included a system of gravity column transfer trusses and girders, located between floors5 and 7, to transfer loads to the smaller foundation. Existing caissons installed in 1967 were used, along with new ones, to accommodate the building. The 5th floor functioned as a structural diaphragm, providing lateral stability and distribution of loads between the new and old caissons. Above the 7th floor, the building's structure was a typical tube-frame design, with columns in the core and on the perimeter, and <b>lateral</b> <b>loads</b> resisted by perimeter moment frames.|$|E

In his autobiography, Lauda described the car as being unpleasant to drive due to the <b>lateral</b> <b>loads</b> and reliance on aerodynamics over driver skill.

40|$|Abstract: Recently, {{attention}} has been paid to the performance-based seismic design that requires designing the building for several expected performance levels. This is achievable through a design procedure based on the inelastic responses. In order to estimate the inelastic seismic responses of a building, the pushover analysis is used, for its simplicity compared with the nonlinear time-history analysis. In pushover analysis, however, the first step is to select a particular <b>lateral</b> <b>load</b> pattern, which affects the resulting capacity curve that may over- or under-estimate building seismic capacity. Therefore, the selection of a reasonable <b>lateral</b> <b>load</b> pattern is particularly important in pushover analysis. The aim of this study is to analyze the effect of <b>lateral</b> <b>load</b> patterns on the seismic performance of low-to-mid-rise Reinforced Concrete (RC) frame buildings.
