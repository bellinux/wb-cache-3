40|$|Abstract Objective To {{determine}} {{the relationship between}} lower extremity alignment and MTSS amongst non-professional athletes Design In a prospective Study, sixty six subjects were evaluated. Bilateral navicular drop test, Q angle, Achilles angle, tibial angle, intermalleolar and intercondylar distance were measured. In addition, runner's height, body mass, history of previous running injury, running experience was recorded. Runners were followed for 17 weeks to determine occurrence of MTSS. Results The overall injury rate for MTSS was 19. 7 %. The MTSS injury rate in girls (22 %) was {{not significantly different from}} the rate in boys (14. 3 %). Most MTSS injuries were induced after 60 hours of exercise, which did not differ between boys and girls. There was a significant difference in right and left navicular drop (ND) in athletes with MTSS. MTSS had no significant correlation with other variables including Quadriceps, Tibia and Achilles angles, intercondylar and intermaleolar lengths and lower extremity lengths. Limitation All measurements performed in this study were uniplanar and static. The small sample size deemed our main limitation. The accurate assessment of participants with previous history of anterior leg pain for MTSS was another <b>limitation.</b> <b>Conclusion</b> Although a significant relationship between navicular drop and MTSS was found in this study; there was not any significant relationship between lower extremity alignment and MTSS in our sample study. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Purpose CT-guided {{percutaneous}} transthoracic lung {{needle biopsy}} (PLB) {{is an effective}} procedure for obtaining cyto-histological diagnoses of peripheral lesions. However, upper postero-lateral lung nodules (UPLN) {{may be difficult to}} reach using a standard intercostal either anterior or lateral approach or when the nodule is just behind a rib or scapula. We evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of trans-scapular approach (tPLB) in these patients using large-core needles. Methods We retrospectively collected the data of 11 consecutive patients (mean age 74. 6 years, SD 5. 9) among those scheduled to undergo CT-guided PLB over the period February 2015 to February 2017. In these patients, the presence of a UPLN required a tPLB using a co-axial technique and large full-core needles (15 G for the scapular piercing and 18 – 19 G for tissue sampling). All patients were assessed by telephone at 24 h, 78 h and at an office visit at 30 days after the procedure to evaluate post-procedural pain (VAS score) and shoulder mobility. Results Ten of the eleven samples were diagnostic. No major complications were encountered. Three patients developed a pneumothorax, but none required pleural drainage. All the patients confirmed the absence of pain at 24 – 72 h and 30 days, reporting a VAS score less than 1, without any shoulder mobility <b>limitation.</b> <b>Conclusion</b> tPLB seems to be an effective and feasible procedure, accompanied by a low risk of pneumothorax in UPLN cases...|$|E
40|$|Background The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) {{classification}} of severity of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) is {{based solely on}} obstruction and does not capture physical functioning. The hypothesis that the Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnoea scale would correlate better with quality of life than the level of airflow limitation was examined. Aim To study the associations between quality of life in smokers and limitations in physical functioning (MRC dyspnoea scale) and, quality of life and airflow limitation (GOLD COPD stages). Design Cross-sectional study. Setting The city of IJsselstein, a small town in the centre of The Netherlands. Method Male smokers aged 40 - 65 years without a prior diagnosis of COPD and enlisted with a general practice, participated in this study. Quality of life was assessed by means of a generic (SF- 36) and a disease-specific, questionnaire (QOLRIQ). Results A total of 395 subjects (mean age 55. 4 years, pack years 27. 1) performed adequate spirometry and completed the questionnaires. Limitations of physical functioning according to the MRC dyspnoea scale were found in 25. 1 % (99 / 395) of the participants and airflow limitation in 40. 2 % (159 / 395). The correlations of limitations of physical functioning with all quality-of-life components were stronger than the correlations of all quality-of-life subscales with the severity of airflow <b>limitation.</b> <b>Conclusion</b> In middle-aged smokers the correlation of limitations of physical functioning (MRC dyspnoea scale) with quality of life was stronger than the correlation of the severity of airflow limitation with quality of life.

40|$|Abstract Background Guanylic {{nucleotides}} {{are both}} macromolecules constituents and crucial regulators {{for a variety}} of cellular processes. Therefore, their intracellular concentration must be strictly controlled. Consistently both yeast and mammalian cells tightly correlate the transcription of genes encoding enzymes critical for guanylic nucleotides biosynthesis with the proliferation state of the cell population. Results To gain insight into the molecular relationships connecting intracellular guanylic nucleotide levels and cellular proliferation, we have studied the consequences of guanylic nucleotide limitation on Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle progression. We first utilized mycophenolic acid, an immunosuppressive drug that specifically inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, the enzyme catalyzing the first committed step in de novo GMP biosynthesis. To approach this system physiologically, we next developed yeast mutants for which the intracellular guanylic nucleotide pools can be modulated through changes of growth conditions. In both the pharmacological and genetic approaches, we found that guanylic nucleotide limitation generated a mother-daughter separation defect, characterized by cells with two unseparated daughters. We then showed that this separation defect resulted from cell wall perturbations but not from impaired cytokinesis. Importantly, cells with similar separation defects were found in a wild type untreated yeast population entering quiescence upon nutrient <b>limitation.</b> <b>Conclusion</b> Our results demonstrate that guanylic nucleotide limitation slows budding yeast cell cycle progression, with a severe pause in telophase. At the cellular level, guanylic nucleotide limitation causes the emergence of cells with two unseparated daughters. By fluorescence and electron microscopy, we demonstrate that this phenotype arises from defects in cell wall partition between mother and daughter cells. Because cells with two unseparated daughters are also observed in a wild type population entering quiescence, our results reinforce the hypothesis that guanylic nucleotide intracellular pools contribute to a signal regulating both cell proliferation and entry into quiescence. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Cysteine has {{a crucial}} role in {{cellular}} physiology and its synthesis is tightly controlled due to its reactivity. However, {{little is known about the}} sulfur metabolism and its regulation in clostridia compared with other firmicutes. In Clostridium perfringens, the two-component system, VirR/VirS, controls the expression of the ubiG operon involved in methionine to cysteine conversion in addition to the expression of several toxin genes. The existence of links between the C. perfringens virulence regulon and sulfur metabolism prompted us to analyze this metabolism in more detail. Results We first performed a tentative reconstruction of sulfur metabolism in C. perfringens and correlated these data with the growth of strain 13 in the presence of various sulfur sources. Surprisingly, C. perfringens can convert cysteine to methionine by an atypical still uncharacterized pathway. We further compared the expression profiles of strain 13 after growth in the presence of cystine or homocysteine that corresponds to conditions of cysteine depletion. Among the 177 genes differentially expressed, we found genes involved in sulfur metabolism and controlled by premature termination of transcription via a cysteine specific T-box system (cysK - cysE, cysP 1 and cysP 2) or an S-box riboswitch (metK and metT). We also showed that the ubiG operon was submitted to a triple regulation by cysteine availability via a T-box system, by the VirR/VirS system via the VR-RNA and by the VirX regulatory RNA. In addition, we found that expression of pfoA (theta-toxin), nagL (one of the five genes encoding hyaluronidases) and genes involved in the maintenance of cell redox status was differentially expressed in response to cysteine availability. Finally, we showed that the expression of genes involved in [Fe-S] clusters biogenesis and of the ldh gene encoding the lactate dehydrogenase was induced during cysteine <b>limitation.</b> <b>Conclusion</b> Several key functions for the cellular physiology of this anaerobic bacterium were controlled in response to cysteine availability. While most of the genes involved in sulfur metabolism are regulated by premature termination of transcription, other still uncharacterized mechanisms of regulation participated in the induction of gene expression during cysteine starvation. </p...|$|E
40|$|Study Design Cross-sectional cohort study. Objective To {{analyze the}} {{differences}} in the prevalence of trigger points (TrPs) between patients with acute whiplash-associated disorders (WADs) and healthy controls, and to determine if widespread pressure hypersensitivity and reduced cervical range of motion are related to the presence of TrPs in patients with acute WADs. Background The relationship between active TrPs and central sensitization is not well understood in patients with acute WADs. Methods Twenty individuals {{with a high level of}} disability related to acute WAD and 20 age- and sex-matched controls participated in the study. TrPs in the temporalis, masseter, upper trapezius, levator scapulae, sternocleidomastoid, suboccipital, and scalene muscles were examined. TrPs are defined as hypersensitive spots in a palpable taut band, producing a local twitch response and referred pain when palpated. Pressure pain threshold (PPT) was assessed bilaterally over the C 5 - 6 zygapophyseal joints, second metacarpal, and tibialis anterior muscle. Active cervical range of motion, neck pain, and self-rated disability using the Neck Disability Index were also assessed. Results The mean ᠓D number of TrPs for the patients with acute WADs was 7. 3 ᠲ. 8 (3. 4 ᠲ. 7 were latent TrPs; 3. 9 ᠲ. 5 were active TrPs). In comparison, healthy controls had 1. 7 ᠲ. 2 latent and no active TrPs (P<. 01). In patients with acute WADs, the most prevalent sites for active TrPs were the levator scapulae and upper trapezius muscles. The number of active TrPs increased with higher neck pain intensity (P<. 001) and a greater number of days since the accident (P =. 003). Patients had significantly lower PPTs in all tested locations and less active cervical range of motion than controls (P<. 001). In the patient group, there were significant negative correlations between the number of active TrPs and PPT over the C 5 - 6 joints and cervical range of motion in flexion, extension, and rotation in both directions: the greater the number of active TrPs, the lower the bilateral PPT over the neck and the greater the cervical range-of-motion <b>limitation.</b> <b>Conclusion</b> The local and referred pain elicited from active TrPs reproduced neck and shoulder pain patterns in individuals with acute WADs with higher levels of disability. Patients with acute WADs exhibited widespread pressure hypersensitivity and reduced cervical mobility. The number of active TrPs was related to higher neck pain intensity, the number of days since the accident, higher pressure pain hypersensitivity over the cervical spine, and reduced active cervical range of motion.

40|$|SUMMERY Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a {{preventable}} and treatable disease characterised by {{airflow limitation}} {{that is not}} fully reversible with some significant extrapulmonary effects that {{may contribute to the}} severity in individual patients. Progressive decline in airflow is associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lung to noxious particles or gases (1). Limitation in the exercise capacity is a major characteristic of COPD, particularly in moderate-severe disease. This may be expressed as dyspnoea occurring during an effort of different intensity, and as reduction in the possibility to perform a normal or almost normal active life. In more severe patients, exercise limitation is so relevant to avoid the patient to leave home and also limiting them in the normal home daily activity. Limitation in exercise capacity in COPD patients has been demonstrated to be related to different mechanisms, which may be differently represented in the same patient. These mechanisms are: a) abnormal mechanical properties of the respiratory system, leading to ventilatory limitation; b) abnormal cardiovascular response to the exercise (cardiac limitation); c) reduction in the peripheral muscle strength and endurance, leading to muscular limitation. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is considered the gold standard for exercise intolerance evaluation. During the test, patients are subjected to symptom limited incremental exercise, breath-by-breath monitoring of cardiopulmonary variables (e. g. pulmonary O 2 uptake, pulmonary CO 2 output, minute ventilation (Ve), heart rate (HR), assessment of perceptual responses (e. g. dyspnea, leg discomfort) and measurements such as exercise-related arterial oxygen desaturation, dynamic hyperinflation and limb-muscle strength. Other methods for assessing exercise limitation in COPD are: endurance time, incremental shuttle walking test (ISWT), endurance shuttle walking test (ESWT). To quantify the physical activity in daily life through motion sensors like Armband SenseWear becomes important in the valuation of COPD patients. Several studies have attempted to correlate the tolerance effort of COPD patients with various physiological parameters, clinical, metabolic and inflammatory. However, few studies have attempted to simultaneously consider many different factors that can contribute to determine the limitation exercise in these patients. This is important to determine which of several pathophysiological, biological and metabolic mechanisms are primarily responsible for limiting the effort in individual patients with COPD. The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess in a large group of patients with COPD of different severity, the relative role of the different components of the disease which may have influence on the response to the exercise. In this attempt, we chose the response to the CPET as the more accurate method for evaluating the pulmonary, cardiovascular and metabolic responses to the exercise, and we tried to correlated the response to CPET with several baseline findings. We included a large, although not exhaustive, number of measurements, including: a) clinical findings (rate of dyspnoea, exacerbation rate, comorbidities); b) pulmonary function measurements; c) respiratory muscle strength measurements; d) metabolic findings (BMI, FFM, blood haemoglobin); e) markers of airway and systemic inflammation (derived from induced sputum, exhaled breath or peripheral blood) or cardiac involvement (pro-BNP). We tried also, in a multivariate analysis performed of all examined patients and in subgroups of patients according to the main factor limiting exercise, to assess the main determinants, among those already mentioned, which may have influence on the exercise limitation. Study design The study is a cross-sectional study and took place in three visits, along a study period of 2 weeks. We studied fifty-one outpatients with stable COPD between July 2008 and May 2010, recruited among those attending to the clinics of our Respiratory Pathophysiology Unit of the Cardio-Thoracic and Vascular Department of the University of Pisa. Three patients didn’t perform the cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), two patients dropped out before performing the CPET, and one patient was defined at the examination as affected by a relevant asthma-like component of the disease. Forty-five patients were therefore included in the analysis. The patients performed: pulmonary function test, arterial blood analysis, maximal inspiratory (MIP) and expiratory (MEP) pressures, incremental shuttle walking test, cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). Physical activity was measured over at least 7 consecutive days, using a multisensory Armband. Metabolic status was evaluated: body mass index (BMI), Fat Free Mass (FFM) and Fat Free Mass Index (FFMI). The Saint George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) was used for the assessment of the health-related quality of life. Charlson index and CIRS index (Cumulative illness rating scale) were used as valid and reliable methods to measure comorbidity. In a sample of venous peripheral blood, the following biomarkers were measured: C-reactive protein (CRP), total and differential inflammatory cells, haemoglobin and N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) concentration, as a systemic biomarker of heart failure. Sputum was induced and measured: macrophage, lymphocyte, neutrophil, eosinophil percentages were expressed as percent of total inflammatory cells, excluding squamous cells. In the sputum were measured supernatant, TNF-alfa, IL- 8 and neutrophilic elastase (NE). Exhaled nitric oxide (NO) were measured and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) was collected. Statistical analysis was performed on the data obtained in the 45 patients who performed all measurements. All statistical analyses were performed using a SPSS 16. 0 statistical package. Results We considered as dependent variable VO 2 peak/kg, which may be considered the best way for expressing exercise limitation during CPET, and as independent variable all these findings which may potentially have some influence in determining the amount of the exercise limitation. In an univariate single regression analysis, V 02 peak/Kg was significantly correlated with MRC score, FEV 1 % FVC %, SVC % FEV 1 /SVC % IC % RV/TLC %, DLCO %. As regards the correlation with biomarkers measured in the blood, sputum and exhaled condensate we can see that there was no significant correlations of VO 2 peak/kg for many biomarkers, except for some indices of systemic inflammation blood neutrophil %, serum IL- 8, blood microparticles, blood haemoglobin and serum N-Pro-BNP. In a stepwise regression analysis we observed that the only variable that explains the model was blood haemoglobin and total variance explained by this model was 31. 5 %. Excluding haemoglobin aspecific parameters, the variable that explains the model is MRC score, with total variance explain of 20. 5 %. If we consider one independent variable for each clinical, functional and biological field, DLCO % is the variable that explains the model and total the variance explain was 19. 6 %. Other correlations for VO 2 peak/kg with: ISWT, as expected, steps/day and SGRQ. Divided the patients in flow limitation (FL) and no flow limitation(NFL), according Hyatt technique, only in the FL group the VO 2 peak/Kg correlated in univariate analysis with a several clinical functional and biological indices (MRC, FEV 1 %, IC%, DLCO%; steps/day, SGRQ tot %). In stepwise regression analysis MRC and IC% were the parameters that enter in the analysis, with cumulative R 2 = 0. 454. Considering the patients that had interrupted the CPET for ventilator limitation (30 patients out of 45) in univariate analysis VO 2 peak/Kg correlated with MRC, FEV 1 %, IC%, DLCO%, MIP, serum pro-BNP, TEE, ISWT, SGRQ tot %. In stepwise regression analysis were excluded ISWT and parameters of Armband; only MRC entered in the model (p= 0. 021, R= 0. 589) and explained the 34. 7 % of variance of exercise tolerance. In the patients that interrupted the CPET for muscular limitation (15 patients), the exercise tolerance not correlated with functional parameters but several indices: age, blood neutrophils %, blood eosinophils %, sputum neutrophils %, ISWT. This patients had less compromise in FEV 1 % and higher MRC score than the 30 patients that stopped CPET for ventilator <b>limitation.</b> <b>Conclusion</b> In the present cross sectional study, we tried to examine the determinants of the exercise limitation which is a characteristic of the patients with moderate-severe COPD. We included a large, although not exhaustive, series of clinical, functional and biological measurements, in order to find which variable, among those considered, might have the predominant role in determining the limitation in exercise capacity. We chose the maximum specific oxygen consumption (VO 2 peak/kg), obtained during a CPET, as a good marker of the exercise limitation in our COPD patients. We found that several clinical, functional and biological variables were significantly correlated with VO 2 peak/kg. Many of these correlations were expected according to the pathophysiology of the disease (like MRC, IC, DLCO), but some of them were fairly unexpected (like some biomarkers). Furthermore, our study was not able to show significant correlations with other variable which may be considered as possible determinants of the exercise capacity (like respiratory muscle strength, BMI or FFM). When me included the variables which resulted significantly correlated with VO 2 max/kg in a multivariate step-wise regression (according to different models), we found that the man determinants were haemoglobin and, in a second position, MRC dyspnoea score and diffusing capacity. This was particularly true when only subjects with pulmonary mechanical factors which may limit exercise (like the presence of flow limitation), or with a respiratory limitation to the CPET, were considered. This suggest that the main factors limiting the peak oxygen consumption during exercise are represented by non-pulmonary mechanisms in all unselected COPD patients, and by pulmonary mechanisms in COPD patient with clear limitation to the exercise related to the pulmonary disease. Limitation of the study Our study has some limitation. Firstly, we have not directly measured the strength of lower limb muscle, which are main determinants of the maximum work load sustained during the CPET. Secondly, we have no independent measure of the heart function (like ejection fraction or other indices derived from echocardiography). We know that exercise limitation is strongly related to the performance of the cardiovascular system...|$|E

40|$|Methods We {{performed}} a literature search from 1967 to November 2007 {{in the main}} medical search engines and selected 4 randomized trials that compared nails and plates in patients with humeral shaft fractures and that reported on complications due to surgery. We statistically pooled patient data using standard meta-analytic approaches. Our primary outcome was the total complication rate, comprised of all complications listed in the articles included. Secondary outcomes included non-union, infection, nerve palsy, and reoperation rate. Methodology was assessed using the CLEAR NPT. Results When pooling the data of the 4 trials (n = 203 patients), {{we did not find}} a statistically significant difference between implants in the rate of total complications, non-union, infection, nerve-palsy, or the need for reoperation. The studies included were small and had methodological <b>limitations.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> Our meta-analysis suggests stastistically insignificant differences between plates and nails in the treatment of humeral shaft fractures. Small sample sizes, study heterogeneity, and methodological limitations argue strongly for a definitive, large trial. We recommend that this trial should be a randomized controlled trial with appropriate allocation of patients and blinding of patients and care providers and outcome assessors, and that it should include patient-important outcome...|$|R
40|$|Rationale, {{aims and}} {{objectives}} The illness management and recovery scale-clinician version (IMRS-C) {{is a measure}} of outcomes thought to be important indicators of progress for consumers participating in illness management and recovery (IMR). Prior research has examined the psychometric properties of the IMRS-C; extant research supports certain aspects of the scale's reliability (test–retest) and validity (sensitivity to interventions). Analyses based on Rasch provide certain advantages and have not been applied to the IMRS-C. Method This study used an archival IMRS database including responses regarding 697 participants with severe mental illness from a variety of community-based settings. Rasch analyses were utilized to determine item functioning and utility of the IMRS-C. Results Results of Rasch analyses using the IMRS-C as one unidimensional scale were problematic. Analyses grouping items into three separate scales measuring recovery, management and biological vulnerability were more promising, but the third scale had other <b>limitations.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> Results suggest that the items included in the IMRS-C can form two screeners, one for recovery and one for management; items regarding biological vulnerability were inadequate. The assessment could be supplemented by more refined measures of coping/self-management and recovery constructs...|$|R
40|$|Background Pelvic {{fracture}} urethral injury (PFUI) is {{an uncommon}} but potentially devastating result of pelvic fracture. It ranges in severity {{based on the}} cause and the mechanism of injury. Methods We reviewed previous reports to identify the incidence, causes, mechanisms of injury and risk factors of PFUI. In addition, we reviewed the current classification systems and diagnostic methods that have been described to assess the severity of PFUI, to identify optimal management strategies and evaluate outcomes. Results PFUI occurs more commonly in men, but {{is more likely to}} be severe in children. The most common cause is motor vehicle collisions, and the mechanism is typically a ligament rupture at the attachment to the urethra. There is no reliable classification system to differentiate partial and complete PFUI. Retrograde urethrography is the standard imaging method but it has its <b>limitations.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> Despite many reports describing this injury, there is still a need to further clarify the incidence, aetiology and mechanism of injury to better determine optimal management strategies and evaluate outcomes. Consensus in the diagnosis of PFUI is lacking, and outcomes of primary realignment and the role of flexible cystoscopy as a diagnostic method are still to be determined...|$|R
40|$|Background. Lay {{perceptions}} that diet, hygiene and sunlight exposure are {{strongly associated with}} acne causation and exacerbation are common but at variance with the consensus of current dermatological opinion. Objectives. The objective {{of this study was}} to carry out a review of the literature to assess the evidence for diet, face-washing and sunlight exposure in acne management. Methods. Original studies were identified by searches of the Medline, EMBASE, AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine), CINAHL, Cochrane, and DARE databases. Methodological information was extracted from identified articles but, given the paucity of high quality studies found, no studies were excluded from the review on methodological grounds. Results. Given the prevalence of lay perceptions, and the confidence of dermatological opinion in rebutting these perceptions as myths and misconceptions, surprisingly little evidence exists for the efficacy or lack of efficacy of dietary factors, face-washing and sunlight exposure in the management of acne. Much of the available evidence has methodological <b>limitations.</b> <b>Conclusions.</b> Based on the present state of evidence, clinicians cannot be didactic in their recommendations regarding diet, hygiene and face-washing, and sunlight to patients with acne. Advice should be individualized, and both clinician and patient cognizant of its limitations...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{effect of}} {{corporate}} social responsibility upon purchase intent and the benefits perceived by the consumer: an experimental studyConsumers are showing {{a growing concern for}} the social and environmental impact of business activities. In this context, {{corporate social responsibility}} (CSR) has gained importance and is generating a significant debate in academia and business. Several authors have adopted a theoretical premise according to which the consumer perceives an added benefit when purchasing products associated with CSR, this benefit being related to feeling good and to doing good. This research study aims to investigate the effects of CSR upon the benefit perceived by consumers and their purchase intent, in a context in which socially responsible businesses maintain higher pricing than their competition. Through an experiment, the authors tested the effect of CSR on dependent variables. A scale for measuring the perceived benefit variable, which was absent from the literature, was developed. The results showed that the consumers surveyed saw an added benefit in buying the products of socially responsible companies and {{that they are willing to}} pay 10 % more for such products. To close the article, the main <b>limitations,</b> <b>conclusions</b> and suggestions for future research are indicated...|$|R
40|$|Purpose The paper {{provides}} an overview of normalisation and weighting approaches within life cycle assessment and aims at identifying purposes, current practices, pros and cons, as well as research gaps in normalisation and weighting. Based on this information, the paper wants to provide guidance to developers and practitioners. The underlying work was conducted under the umbrella of the UNEP-SETAC Life Cycle Initiative, Task Force on Cross-Cutting issues in LCIA. Methods The empirical work consisted in: (i) an online survey to investigate the perception of the LCA community regarding the scientific quality and current practice concerning normalisation and weighting; (ii) a classification followed by systematic expert-based assessment of existing methods for normalisation and weighting according to a set of five criteria: scientific robustness, documentation, coverage, uncertainty, complexity. Results and discussion The survey results showed that normalised results and weighting scores are perceived as relevant for decision-making, but further development is needed to improve uncertainty and robustness. The classification and systematic assessment of methods allowed for the identification of specific advantages and <b>limitations.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> Based on the results, recommendations are provided to practitioners that desire to apply normalisation and weighting as well as to developers of the underlying methods.

40|$|Purpose. Goal setting {{has been}} {{described}} as the core skill of rehabilitation professionals, but there is little information about patients understanding of goal setting. This study explored how in-patients with neurological impairments experienced two different types of goal setting and identified the issues that underpin individuals' experience of goal setting. Method. The study took place in a neurological rehabilitation unit in which two approaches to goal setting were being used that differed in the amount of patient involvement. A qualitative research design was adopted. Six focus groups were convened, three for participants experiencing usual participation and three for those with increased involvement in goal setting. A total of 28 participants (12 women, mean age 49 years) with a variety of deficits were recruited to the study over nine months. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the focus group transcripts. Findings. Four themes were identified which impact on the ways in which in-patients make sense of goal setting: The rehabilitation process; personal response to goal setting; previous experience and disease <b>limitations.</b> <b>Conclusions.</b> Healthcare professionals working in rehabilitation need to explore patients' understandings of their disease and their experiences and expectations of goal setting to ensure goal setting is a meaningful activity...|$|R
40|$|Background This study {{assessed}} the clinical and radiological outcomes of different non-surgical interventions, surgical versus non-surgical interventions, and different surgical interventions {{used in the}} management of proximal fifth metatarsal fractures. Methods A systematic review of published and unpublished literature was undertaken. Results Six studies, assessing 330 patients and 333 fractures of the proximal fifth metatarsal were reviewed. Four studies assessed outcomes following tuberosity fractures, whilst 2 studies recruited patients following proximal diaphyseal or Jones fractures. The findings suggested that bandage is superior to below knee cast immobilisation for patient-reported functional and pain scores, with no difference in fracture union or re-fracture, and a shorter duration to return to work. There {{was no significant difference in}} complication rates or functional outcomes for patients managed in a plaster slipper compared to a bandage post-injury. When comparing surgical and non-surgical management, intramedullary screw fixation results in a shorter time to fracture union, reduced complication rates and earlier return to pre-injury activities compared to non-surgical cast immobilisation. However, the evidence-base is limited in it size and presented with a number of methodological <b>limitations.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> Further well-conducted randomised controlled trials are required to determine the optimal management strategy for the different types of proximal fifth metatarsal fractures...|$|R
40|$|Background. In {{this short}} communication, {{our focus is}} on the {{relationship}} between human concentrations of select persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and environmental emissions. It is based on a longitudinal study (1979 - 2007) conducted in Norway. Objectives. Our aim was to extract general insights from observed and predicted temporal trends in human concentrations of 49 POPs to assist in the design and interpretation of future monitoring studies. Discussion. Despite considerable decline for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) since 1986, the sum of the targeted POPs increased from 1979 until 2001, with per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) dominating recent blood burden measurements. Specifically, the time trends in serum concentrations of POPs, exemplified by PCB- 153, 1, 1 '-(2, 2, 2 -Trichloroethane- 1, 1 -diyl) bis(4 -chlorobenzene) (DDT) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), resembled the trends in available data on their emissions, production or use. These observations suggest that interpretations of human biomonitoring data on persistent compounds must consider historic emissions, which likely vary spatially across the globe. Based on the different temporal trends observed across POP groups, it is evident that generalizations regarding temporal aspects have <b>limitations.</b> <b>Conclusion.</b> The discussion herein underscores the importance of understanding temporal variations in environmental emissions when designing and interpreting human biomonitoring studies...|$|R
40|$|Title: Improving Alliance Satisfaction: The Resource Alignment of IT Competency in Small Healthcare CentersKeywords: e-health, IT competency, {{alliance}} performance, health promotion. Category of paper: Research paperPurpose of the research/paper: The {{objective of}} this research is to establish whether greater deployment of resource alignments leads to more satisfactory alliance. Two research questions are proposed: (1) do organizations which use supplementarity alignment more likely to be satisfied with their alliance activities compared with those which have adopted asymmetric supplementarity alignment? and (2) do organizations which use complementarity alignment more likely to be satisfied with their alliance activities compared with those which have adopted asymmetric complementarity alignment? Methodology: Case Study Interviews. Findings: IT competency can be built into four types of IT resource alignment for cooperative alliance and different types of IT resource alignment can affect alliance performance differently. Moreover, we found that the contribution of symmetric complementary and supplementary IT competency by both the focal and partner firms had a significant positive impact on the degree of satisfaction of the focal firms. Value of the paper: The paper will be of interest to academics, health professionals, and healthcare managers.
