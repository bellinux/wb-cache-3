The basic assumption made in designing second-generation <b>lunar</b> <b>vehicles</b> and equipment was that a network of permanent lunar bases already existed. The designs were to facilitate the transportation of personnel and materials. The eight topics to choose from included flying vehicles, ground-based vehicles, robotic arms, and life support systems. Two teams {{of two or three}} members competed on each topic and results were exhibited at a formal presentation. A clean-propellant powered <b>lunar</b> flying transport <b>vehicle,</b> an extra-vehicular activity life support system, a pressurized lunar rover for greater distances, and a robotic arm design project are discussed...|$|R
40|$|<b>Lunar</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{that will}} be space based and {{reusable}} will require resupply of propellants in orbit. Approximately 75 pct. of the total mass delivered to low earth orbit will be propellants. Consequently, the propellant management techniques selected for Space Exploration Initiative (SEI) orbital operations will have {{a major influence on}} the overall SEI architecture. Five proposed propellant management facility (PMF) concepts were analyzed and compared {{in order to determine the}} best method of resupplying reusable, space based <b>Lunar</b> Transfer <b>Vehicles</b> (LTVs). The processing time needed at the Space Station to prepare LTV for its next lunar mission was estimated for each of the PMF concepts. The estimated times required to assemble and maintain the different PMF concepts were also compared. The results of the maintenance analysis were similar, with co-orbiting depots needing 100 to 350 pct. more annual maintenance. The first few external tanks mating operations at KSC encountered many problems that could cause serious lunar mission schedule delays. The use of drop tanks on <b>lunar</b> <b>vehicles</b> increases by a factor of four the number of critical propellant interface disturbances...|$|R

The terrain around his camp is not suitable, so Kemp and Clementine land and travel the remaining distance using a lunar buggy.

They are shot at by some of Hubbard's men, who have followed them to the camp.|$|E
50|$|Luna 17 was {{launched}} from an Earth parking orbit towards the Moon and entered lunar orbit on 15 November 1970. The spacecraft softly {{landed on the}} Moon in the Sea of Rains. The spacecraft had dual ramps by which the payload, Lunokhod 1, descended to the lunar surface. Lunokhod 1 was a <b>lunar</b> <b>vehicle</b> formed of a tub-like compartment with a large convex lid on eight independently powered wheels. Lunokhod 1 was equipped with a cone-shaped antenna, a highly directional helical antenna, four television cameras, and special extendable devices to impact the lunar soil for soil density and mechanical property tests. An x-ray spectrometer, an x-ray telescope, cosmic-ray detectors, and a laser device were also included. The vehicle was powered by a solar cell array mounted {{on the underside of}} the lid. Lunokhod 1 was intended to operate through three lunar days but actually operated for eleven lunar days (eleven earth months). The operations of Lunokhod officially ceased on 4 October 1971, the anniversary of Sputnik 1, after having travelled over 10.5 kilometers while taking pictures and performing numerous tests.|$|E

The vehicle was powered by batteries which were recharged during the lunar day by a solar cell array mounted {{on the underside of}} the lid. To be able to work in vacuum a special fluoride based lubricant was used for the mechanical parts and the electric motors (one in each wheel hub) were enclosed in pressurized containers. During the lunar nights, the lid was closed and a polonium-210 radioisotope heater unit kept the internal components at operating temperature. Lunokhod 1 was intended to operate through three lunar days (approximately three Earth months) but actually operated for eleven lunar days.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{parametric design}} studies of electric propulsion <b>lunar</b> transfer <b>vehicles.</b> In designing a <b>lunar</b> transfer <b>vehicle,</b> selecting the 'best' operating {{points for the}} design parameters allows significant reductions in the mass in low earth orbit (LEO) for the mission. These parameters include the specific impulse, the power level, and the propulsion technology. Many of the decisions regarding the operating points are controlled by the propulsion and power system technologies that are available for the spacecraft. The relationship between these technologies is discussed and analyzed here. It is found that both ion and MPD propulsion offer significant LEO mass reductions over O 2 /H 2 for <b>lunar</b> transfer <b>vehicle</b> missions. The recommended operating points for the <b>lunar</b> transfer <b>vehicle</b> are an I(sp) of 5000 lb(f) -s/lb(m) and a 1 MW power level. For large lunar missions, krypton {{may be the best}} choice for ion propulsion...|$|R

5000|$|Two teenage boys, Marty and Steve, live in {{a colony}} on the Moon, [...] "The Bubble", in the year 2068. Exploring outside the dome of [...] "The Bubble" [...] is {{strictly}} controlled. The boys grow bored and decide to borrow a <b>lunar</b> <b>vehicle.</b> They discover someone has forgot to remove their key, which {{makes it possible for}} them to explore beyond proscribed boundaries without restriction. They go on a journey to an old and abandoned base, where they find the diary of Andrew Thurgood, a missing early lunar settler. The diary contains coordinates to a place Thurgood claimed he saw something that looked like a huge flower, and the boys decide to go there and do some investigating themselves. They crash through the moon's surface into a series of underground caverns containing fluorescent plants, many of them able to move, which is a part of and controlled by a single intelligent alien life form. They also meet a man, the missing settler from 70 years earlier, who has become enthralled by the alien. He {{does not seem to have}} aged during all those years. The boys are torn between staying in the caves, within which the alien provides an idyllic life fulfilling all their needs, and escaping. The longer they stay, the more their minds are affected. They eventually escape, but the man decides to stay, having lost any desires beyond worshipping the alien.|$|E
50|$|LADTAG experts {{recommend}} that the toxicity of lunar dust on the lungs (pulmonary toxicity), eyes (ocular toxicity), and skin (dermal toxicity) be investigated, and that this investigation is to be conducted by the Lunar Dust Toxicity Research Project (LDTRP) using various assays including in vivo and in vitro methods. In an initial LADTAG workshop that was held in 2005, experts noted that {{they were unable to}} reconcile individual expert opinions to set an inhalation standard. The array of opinions from these experts spanned a 300-fold range (i.e., 0.01 to 3 mg/m3). The members of the LADTAG concluded that research is necessary to narrow this wide uncertainty range, the lower end of which cannot be met by known methods of environmental control, and that there is an urgency to determine the standard so that environmental systems for the <b>lunar</b> <b>vehicle</b> can be appropriately designed. Therefore, in keeping with the LADTAG experts' recommendations, members of the LDTRP have reviewed first-hand accounts of Apollo astronauts who were exposed to lunar dust during their missions as well as of terrestrial-based human exposures to dust generated in the mining industry and to volcanic ash. In accordance with the LADTAG recommendations to increase our evidence base, the LDTRP is conducting studies of Apollo spacesuits, filters, vacuum bags, and rock-collection boxes. These studies will enable us to focus our understanding of the grain-size distribution that is present in the lunar surface samples and in the habitat, but the dust surfaces are expected to be fully passivated.|$|E
