The paper proposes and proves the theorem of spatial <b>location</b> unit distribution model according {{to the analysis of}} the <b>location</b> error produced during <b>location</b> using the polygon <b>location</b> method in the three-dimensional space. On this basis, the <b>location</b> unit selection (LUS) algorithm is proposed by improving on the traditional polygon <b>location</b> algorithm. The simulation results indicate that the <b>location</b> unit distribution model theorem and the LUS algorithm can meet the requirements of a ubiquitous terminal’s real-time <b>location</b> and possess a preferable precision in <b>location.</b> Index Terms—pervasive computing, <b>location</b> error, <b>location</b> unit distribution model, <b>location</b> unit selection (LUS) algorithm I...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the <b>location</b> {{management}} cost of users moving to and fro between two <b>location</b> areas, a <b>location</b> management strategy based on Dual <b>Location</b> Areas in LEO satellite network is proposed. A combined two <b>location</b> area with satellite <b>location</b> area and Fix Earth Station (FES) <b>location</b> area is designed to divide network coverage area. Users initiate <b>location</b> update procedure when both boundaries of the two <b>location</b> areas are crossed. Based on the Dual <b>Location</b> Areas a corresponding two-step paging strategy is implemented without complicated calculation in order to detect users’ <b>location.</b> Compared with the <b>location</b> management strategy used in Iridium system, simulation results indicate that the strategy decreases <b>location</b> update cost of to-and-fro users and the system paging bandwidth is also saved...|$|R

There is a trade-off between <b>location</b> update effort (when a node moves) and node finding effort. In this paper we present a dynamic <b>location</b> management strategy that has the following features: (i) all <b>location</b> servers need not maintain <b>location</b> information about every mobile node, (ii) a coterie based approach is adopted for <b>location</b> update and find, (iii) every node move does not result in <b>location</b> updates, (iv) <b>location</b> updates are done at a subset of <b>location</b> servers, (v) a subset of <b>location</b> servers are queried when a mobile node is to be located, (vi) the set of <b>location</b> servers, corresponding to a mobile node, for <b>location</b> update and find operations is dynamic, (vii) the dynamic nature of these sets helps alleviate situations of heavy burden on some <b>location</b> servers, when a large number of mobile nodes are concentrated in a small geographical area.

40|$|<b>Location</b> {{management}} {{is a fundamental}} problem in mobile computing systems. Existing industry standards employ centralized <b>location</b> management schemes. Centralized schemes are not highly scalable. This paper presents a new, distributed <b>location</b> management strategy for mobile systems. Its salient features are fast <b>location</b> update and query, load balancing among <b>location</b> servers, and scalability. The strategy employs dynamic hashing techniques and quorums to manage <b>location</b> update and query operations. <b>Location</b> information of a mobile host is replicated at a subset of <b>location</b> servers. The set of <b>location</b> servers associated with a mobile host changes with time, depending on the <b>location</b> of mobile hosts and load on the servers. This dynamism prevents situations of heavy load (<b>location</b> update and query messages) on some <b>location</b> servers when the mobile hosts are not uniformly distributed in space, or when some mobile hosts have their <b>location</b> updated or queried more often than others.

5|$|In 1990, Hungry Jack's renewed its {{franchise}} agreement with then BK parent Burger King Corporation, which allowed Hungry Jack's to license third party franchisee. One {{of the terms}} and conditions of the renewed agreement required Hungry Jack's to open a minimum number of new <b>locations</b> each year {{for the duration of}} the contract. Shortly after the Australian trademark on the Burger King name lapsed in 1996, Burger King requested that Cowin rebrand the Hungry Jack's <b>locations</b> to Burger King, which Cowin declined. Burger King Corporation accused Hungry Jack's of violating the conditions of the renewed {{franchise agreement}} by failing to expand the chain at the rate defined and sought to terminate the agreement. Under the aegis of this claim, Burger King Corporation, in partnership with Royal Dutch Shell's Australian division Shell Company of Australia Ltd., began to open its own stores in 1997 beginning in Sydney and extending throughout the regions of New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory and Victoria. In addition, BK sought to limit HJ's ability to open new <b>locations</b> in the country, whether they were corporate <b>locations</b> or third-party licensees.|$|E

30|$|Guided by the peer-tree {{indexing}} structure, the <b>location</b> updates and <b>location</b> queries can be propagated in {{an organized}} manner. Namely, <b>location</b> updates are propagated to {{a small number of}} other hosts, while <b>location</b> queries are forwarded to the hosts where the queries are likely answered. A <b>location</b> update and a <b>location</b> query are always forwarded to the closer friends of the host whose <b>location</b> is being updated and under query, respectively. The process of forwarding a <b>location</b> update or a <b>location</b> query can be imagined as traversing a path in the complete binary tree beginning at the root and moving toward the leaf level. Forwarding a <b>location</b> update or a <b>location</b> query is gradually forwarded to its closer friends, and the number of times a <b>location</b> update or a <b>location</b> query can be forwarded is restricted by the height of the peer-tree. An actual forwarding path is jointly determined by the peer-tree and the temporary connectivity in a network.|$|R
