25|$|The {{findings}} of this study may be applicable to other work settings, including factories, restaurants, offices, and universities. The study concludes that individual strategies for coping with sexual harassment are not <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>effective</b> and may have unexpected negative consequences for the workplace and may even lead to increased sexual harassment. Women who try to deal with sexual harassment on their own, regardless of what they do, seem to be in a no-win situation.|$|E
25|$|In {{recreational}} diving, {{a pair of}} divers {{is usually}} the best combination in buddy diving; with threesomes, one of the divers can easily lose {{the attention of the}} other two. Groups with more than three divers are not using the buddy system. The system is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>effective</b> in mitigating out-of-air emergencies, non-diving medical emergencies and entrapment in ropes or nets. When used with the buddy check it can help avoid the omission, misuse and failure of diving equipment.|$|E

He turned to the west, reaching Lechlade on the 26th, less than a fortnight after the battle of Naseby. Westminster made one last attempt to dictate the plan of campaign, but the Committee refused to pass-on the directions of the Houses, and Fairfax remained free to deal with Goring, as he desired.|$|E
25|$|As {{previously}} stated function {{refers to}} the effect the behavior produces on the environment. The actual form of the behavior is referred to the topography. Different behaviors may serve the same function, thus describing one limitation of treating behaviors based on form alone. For example, a child may scream, hit, and cry to obtain attention from his mother. What the behavior looks like often reveals little useful information about the conditions that account for it. However, identifying the conditions that account for a behavior, suggests what conditions need to be altered to change the behavior. Therefore, assessment of function of a behavior can yield useful information with respect to intervention strategies that are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>effective.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{selection}} {{of individuals to}} be assigned to specific teams bears on the resulting effectiveness of those teams. Aspects of team composition {{that should be considered}} during the team selection process include team members' knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) as well their personalities and attitudes. To achieve high-quality results, teams built with members having higher skill levels are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>effective</b> than teams built around members having lesser skills; teams that include a members with a diversity of skills are also likely to show improved team performance. Additionally, higher levels of cognitive ability of team members has been shown to consistently correlate to increased work group effectiveness. Team members' personalities and attitudes have also been studied. For example, the personality factors agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, and emotional stability are related to better team performance.|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{assess the}} cost {{effectiveness}} of routine vaccination of 12 year old schoolgirls against human papillomavirus {{infection in the}} United Kingdom. Design Economic evaluation. Setting UK. Population Schoolgirls aged 12 or older. Main outcome measures Costs, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost effectiveness ratios {{for a range of}} vaccination options. Results Vaccinating 12 year old schoolgirls with a quadrivalent vaccine at 80 % coverage <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cost <b>effective</b> at a willingness to pay threshold of £ 30 000 (€ 37 700; $ 59 163) per QALY gained, if the average duration of protection from the vaccine is more than 10 years. Implementing a catch-up campaign of girls up <b>to</b> age 18 <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cost <b>effective.</b> Vaccination of boys <b>is</b> unlikely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cost <b>effective.</b> A bivalent vaccine with the same efficacy against human papillomavirus types 16 and 18 costing £ 13 -£ 21 less per dose (depending on the duration of vaccine protection) may <b>be</b> as cost <b>effective</b> as the quadrivalent vaccine although less effective as it does not prevent anogenital warts. Conclusions Routine vaccination of 12 year old schoolgirls combined with an initial catch-up campaign up <b>to</b> age 18 <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cost <b>effective</b> in the UK. The results <b>are</b> robust <b>to</b> uncertainty in many parameters and processes. A key influential variable is the duration of vaccine protection...|$|R

25|$|Although {{the core}} {{character}} deficits of highly psychopathic individuals {{are likely to}} be highly incorrigible to the currently available treatment methods, the antisocial and criminal behavior associated with it may be more amenable to management, the management of which being the main aim of therapy programs in correctional settings. It has been suggested that the treatments that may be most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>effective</b> at reducing overt antisocial and criminal behavior are those that focus on self-interest, emphasizing the tangible, material value of prosocial behavior, with interventions that develop skills to obtain what the patient wants out of life in prosocial rather than antisocial ways. To this end, various therapies have been tried with the aim of reducing the criminal activity of incarcerated offenders with psychopathy, with mixed success. As psychopathic individuals are insensitive to sanction, reward-based management, in which small privileges are granted in exchange for good behavior, has been suggested and used to manage their behavior in institutional settings.|$|E

60|$|At {{the same}} time, {{do not let}} us suppose that these Trade Boards will, in the first instance, be very strong or {{representative}} bodies.

Where possible, they will be partly elective; {{in many cases they}} will, I expect, have to begin by being almost entirely nominated. In some cases it will be upon the official members alone that the main burden will fall. I could not ask the House to confer upon bodies of this nebulous character, not representative, not elective in any democratic sense, responsible not to constituents, nor to a public department, nor to Parliament itself in any way, the absolute and final power of enforcing by the whole apparatus of the law any decision, whether wise or foolish, upon wage questions to which they may come by the narrowest majority. The work which we entrust to them wholly and finally is sufficiently difficult and important. We direct them by this Bill to prescribe minimum rates of wages. They are to find the minimum rate. For that purpose they are as well qualified as any body that we could devise. In this sphere their jurisdiction will be complete. The Board of Trade will not retry the question of what is the right minimum rate. Another and quite different question will be decided by the Board of Trade. They will decide whether the minimum rate which has been prescribed by the Trade Board commands sufficient support in the trade to make its enforcement by inspection and prosecution <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>effective.</b>|$|E
