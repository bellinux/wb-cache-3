50|$|One {{possible}} {{reason for the}} relationship between chronic stress and health outcomes is the effect that stress has on the physiology of a person. This is referred to as a direct relationship between chronic stress and health. The long term stress hormone, cortisol, {{is believed to be the}} key driver in this relationship. Chronic stress has been found to be significantly associated with chronic <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> <b>inflammation,</b> slower wound healing, increased susceptibility to infections, and poorer responses to vaccines. For example, a study of otherwise healthy adult males found that those with high levels of perceived stress in their lives had significantly longer wound healing times, and that elevated cortisol levels, rather than health behaviour responses, appeared to be the main reason for this relationship. Meta-analysis of healing studies has found that there is a robust relationship between elevated stress levels and slower healing for many different acute and chronic conditions However, it is also important to note that certain factors, such as coping styles and social support, can mitigate the relationship between chronic stress and health outcomes.|$|E

The association between skin diseases in general and systemic inflammation has not previously been studied at the population level. A whole-body investigation on 1, 930 adults belonging to Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 was performed and high sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP) level was measured as a marker of <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> <b>inflammation</b> {{in order to determine}} the association between <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> <b>inflammation</b> and skin diseases in an unselected adult population. After adjustment for confounding factors the following skin disorders were associated with <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> <b>inflammation</b> in multinomial logistic regression analysis: atopic eczema (OR 2. 2, 95 % CI 1. 2 – 3. 9), onychomycosis (OR 2. 0, 1. 2 – 3. 2) and rosacea (OR 1. 7, 1. 1 – 2. 5). After additionally adjusting for body mass index and systemic diseases, the risks for atopic eczema (OR 2. 4, 1. 3 – 4. 6) and onychomycosis (OR 1. 9, 1. 1 – 3. 1) remained statistically significant.

40|$|Ageing is {{characterized}} by a decline in muscle mass that could be explained by a defect in the regulation of postprandial muscle protein metabolism. Indeed, the stimulatory effect of food intake on protein synthesis and its inhibitory effect on proteolysis is blunted in old muscles from both animals and humans. Recently, <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> <b>inflammation</b> has been suspected {{to be one of the}} factors responsible for the decreased sensitivity of muscle protein metabolism to food intake. This study was undertaken to examine the effect of long-term prevention of <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> <b>inflammation</b> on muscle protein metabolism during ageing. Old rats (20 months of age) were separated into two groups: a control group and a group (IBU) in which <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> <b>inflammation</b> had been reduced with a non-steroidal anti inflammatory drug (ibuprofen). After 5 months of treatment, inflammatory markers and cytokine levels were significantly improved in treated old rats when compared with the controls: − 22. 3 % fibrinogen, − 54. 2 %α 2 -macroglobulin, + 12. 6 % albumin, − 59. 6 % IL 6 and − 45. 9 % IL 1 β levels. As expected, food intake had no effect on muscle protein synthesis or muscle proteolysis in controls whereas it significantly increased muscle protein synthesis by 24. 8 % and significantly decreased proteolysis in IBU rats. The restoration of muscle protein anabolism at the postprandial state by controlling the development of <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> <b>inflammation</b> in old rats significantly decreased muscle mass loss between 20 and 25 months of age. In conclusion, the observations made in this study have identified <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> <b>inflammation</b> as an important target for pharmacological, nutritional and lifestyle interventions that aim to limit sarcopenia and muscle weakness in the rapidly growing elderly population in Europe and North America...|$|E

40|$|The role of diet in {{reduction}} {{of the risk of}} chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and metabolic syndrome has been widely documented. There is evidence that the link between diet and this kind of diseases is <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> chronic <b>inflammation</b> induced by some nutrients. Inflammation is a natural defense mechanism which helps to avoid tissue injuries caused by biological, physical and chemical factors. Adequate inflammatory process is defined by intensity and duration. As a chronic state (silent <b>inflammation,</b> <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> chronic <b>inflammation),</b> it became an etiologic factor of chronic diseases. References indicate that consumption of some nutrients - such as fatty acids, glucose, bioactive plant compounds, some vitamins and minerals - is related with enhancement or alleviation of inflammatory state. Including them in diet could help to decrease the risk of chronic diseases and health complications caused by them. The aim {{of this paper is to}} show modulation properties of diet due to chronic inflammatory state and short characteristic of chosen components with attributed pro- or anti-inflammatory activity. These properties could be used to formulate diet therapy which could help to reduce inflammatory state and minimalize the risk of chronic diseases...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Liver {{inflammation}} due to HCV infection {{leads to}} fibrosis, {{which is an}} independent predictor of treatment response to interferon therapy in Chronic Hepatitis C (CHC) patients. This relationship has not been studied for liver inflammation on pretreatment liver biopsy and End of Treatment Response (ETR). ALT is a less invasive test than liver biopsy for measuring liver inflammation. Aim {{of this study was}} to compare ETR to Interferon α (recombinant Interferon) & Ribavirin in CHC patients having higher and lower <b>grades</b> of liver <b>inflammation</b> and to determine the diagnostic accuracy of pretreatment ALT for <b>grades</b> of liver <b>inflammation.</b> Methods A retrospective cohort of 876 naïve CHC patients, who completed Interferon α & Ribavirin for 24 [*]weeks, was studied for ETR. Pretreatment <b>grade</b> of <b>inflammation</b> on liver biopsy was taken as the exposure variable. It was classified as high if there was moderate or severe and low if there was minimal or mild. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was performed. Diagnostic accuracy of pretreatment ALT for liver <b>inflammation</b> <b>grades</b> was determined by computing Area Under the Receiver Operator Curve (AUROC). Results Of all patients, 672 having diagnostic liver biopsy and ETR available were analyzed. Among them, 103 had high and 569 had <b>low</b> <b>grades</b> of liver <b>inflammation.</b> Mean age was 36. 9 (SD 9. 1) years, with patients with high grades being older than those with <b>low</b> <b>grades</b> <b>inflammation</b> (p[*]=��� 0. 03). High <b>grades</b> of liver <b>inflammation</b> was associated with ETR (RR 1. 17, 95 % CI 1. 12 – 1. 18) adjusting for age, Total Leukocyte count (TLC) and pretreatment levels of ALT, irrespective of liver fibrosis. This relation remained significant for ‘bridging fibrosis and cirrhosis’ and not for ‘no’ or ‘portal fibrosis’. AUROC of pretreatment ALT for males and females was moderately accurate for severe inflammation compared to minimal inflammation and less accurate for high <b>grades</b> compared to <b>low</b> <b>grades.</b> Conclusions ETR in patients with higher <b>grades</b> of liver <b>inflammation</b> was 17 % higher than those with lower grades irrespective of fibrosis and 9 % higher for bridging fibrosis and cirrhosis.

40|$|Metabolic {{alterations}} such as {{insulin resistance}} {{are thought to}} underlie the endothelial dysfunction and <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> <b>inflammation</b> found in morbid obesity. Twenty-six morbidly obese patients, aged 39. 0 +/- 10. 0 (mean +/- sd), were evaluated before and 4. 2 +/- 0. 8 months after bariatric surgery. A marked increment in the insulin sensitivity index (S(I)) and the endothelium-dependent vasodilatory response in a dorsal hand vein was observed after weight loss following bariatric surgery. Circulating levels of E-selectin, P-selectin, plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1, and von Willebrand factor, which were higher {{than those in the}} control group, decreased significantly after surgery. Plasma vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1, angiotensin-converting enzyme, intercellular adhesion molecule- 1, thrombomodulin, and plasma and intraplatelet cGMP levels did not change after weight loss. All inflammatory markers were higher in morbidly obese patients. After surgery, C- reactive protein and sialic acid diminished, whereas circulating levels of IL- 6, TNF-alpha, and its soluble receptors did not. Positive correlations were found between changes in adiposity and S(I) and changes in C-reactive protein and between changes in sialic acid and changes in endothelial function. In conclusion, a marked improvement in S(I), endothelial function, and <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> <b>inflammation</b> was observed in the weight-losing, morbidly obese patients after bariatric surgery. S(I) and adiposity appear to play roles in obesity-related, <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> <b>inflammation</b> that contribute to the endothelial dysfunction observed in morbid obesity...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS—Enhanced visceral {{sensitivity}} {{following a}} transient inflammatory {{process in the}} gut has been postulated as an aetiological mechanism of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In this study we compared perceptual responses to rectosigmoid distension in patients with mild chronic inflammation of the rectum (ulcerative colitis (UC)) and patients without mucosal inflammation (IBS) to determine if chronic <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> mucosal <b>inflammation</b> may be a plausible explanation for rectosigmoid hypersensitivity reported in both IBS and UC patients.  METHODS—UC disease activity was quantified using activity index scores. Perception thresholds for discomfort during rectosigmoid distension were compared between 11  UC patients with quiescent or mild disease activity, 18  IBS patients, and 13  healthy controls.  RESULTS—Although UC activity index scores negatively correlated with perceptual thresholds for discomfort (r=− 0. 76, p= 0. 016), UC patients had higher discomfort thresholds compared with IBS patients and controls before (p= 0. 02) and after (p< 0. 001) a noxious sigmoid conditioning stimulus.  CONCLUSIONS—Rectal perception was attenuated in UC but enhanced in IBS. In chronic mild inflammation, activation of antinociceptive mechanisms may prevent the development of visceral hyperalgesia. <b>Low</b> <b>grade</b> mucosal <b>inflammation</b> alone {{is unlikely to be}} responsible for symptoms in functional gastrointestinal disorders.    Keywords: ulcerative colitis; irritable bowel syndrome; abdominal pai...|$|R
40|$|Background: Recent {{research}} using serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) has evidenced existence of <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> systemic <b>inflammation</b> in asthmatics whose correlation with various clinical indices {{is not fully}} studied. Objective: To investigate the relationship between systemic inflammation and various clinical and treatment characteristics of asthma. Materials and Methods: Forty asthmatics (22 steroid inhaling and 18 steroid naïve) and 40 healthy subjects matched for age and sex were examined cross-sectionally. Along with clinical assessment, serum hs-CRP levels were measured for all subjects using latex enhanced immunoturbidometry method. Results: Serum hs CRP levels were significantly higher in steroid naïve asthmatics when compared to normal subjects (0. 93 ± 1. 18 vs 0. 24 ± 0. 31 mg/dL, respectively; Mann-Whitney U test, P 0. 05). Among the clinical and treatment related variables, duration of inhaled steroids usage alone correlated significantly with serum hs-CRP levels (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0. 449, P < 0. 05), which was independent of age, BMI, duration of illness, and frequency of emergency visits. Conclusion: This study confirms the existence of <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> systemic <b>inflammation</b> in asthma which is effectively controlled by inhaled steroids.

40|$|Objective: <b>Low</b> <b>grade</b> chronic <b>inflammation</b> {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} to underlie {{the constellation of}} cardiometabolic risk factors, possibly by inducing insulin resistance. In the present study we investigated associations between inflammation markers, insulin sensitivity (M/I) {{and a range of}} cardiometabolic risk factors in a large, healthy population. Research Design and Methods: The RISC cohort includes 1326 non-diabetic, European men and women, aged between 30 - 60 years. We measured cardiometabolic risk factors and performed a hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp. We determined total white blood cell count (WBC) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) as markers of chronic inflammation. Results: WBC and ESR were both strongly associated with M/I. WBC and ESR were further associated with a range of cardiometabolic risk factors. Associations between WBC and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, heart rate, fasting C-peptide and insulin and 2 h insulin in men and women and between WBC and 2 h glucose in women remained significant after adjusting for both M/I and waist circumference. Associations between ESR and HDL cholesterol, heart rate, fasting and 2 h insulin in men and women and between ESR and fat mass in women remained significant after adjusting for M/I and waist. Conclusions: This study showed that <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> chronic <b>inflammation</b> is associated with the cardiometabolic risk profile of a healthy population.

Seventeen women with PCOS (defined {{on the basis of}} elevated testosterone and oligomenorrhea) and 15 healthy women matched as a group for body mass index were recruited. Measurement of CRP concentrations was made using a highly sensitive assay. Insulin resistance was assessed using the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp technique. The women with PCOS had significantly elevated CRP concentrations relative to controls (geometric means, 2. 12 and 0. 67 mg/L, respectively; P = 0. 016). Log CRP correlated with body mass index in both PCOS and controls (r = 0. 58; P < 0. 05 and r = 0. 78; P < 0. 01, respectively) and inversely with insulin sensitivity (r = - 0. 57; P < 0. 05 and r = - 0. 69; P < 0. 01). Total testosterone did not correlate with log CRP in either group. On adjustment for body mass index and age, there remained a significant difference in log CRP between PCOS and controls (t = 2. 13; P < 0. 05).

This study examines the determinants of plasma Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL), which is selectively triggered by TNF alpha. receptor 1 signaling within the central nervous system, and its association with late-life depressive disorder. Methods: Baseline data were obtained from a well-characterized prospective cohort study of 350 depressed and 129 non-depressed older persons (>= 60 years). Past 6 month diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) according to DSM-IV-TR criteria was assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 2. 0). Potential determinants of plasma NGAL included sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle and psychiatric and physical comorbidity. Results: Plasma NGAL concentrations were significantly associated with age, male gender, smoking and waist circumference. Adjusted for these determinants, depressed patients had significantly higher NGAL plasma levels compared to non-depressed comparison group. Depressed patients who did not meet full criteria for MDD in the month before sampling (partially remitted) had lower plasma NGAL levels compared with those who did. Subjects with a recurrent depression had higher plasma NGAL levels compared to those with a first episode. NGAL levels were neither related with specific symptom profiles of depression nor with antidepressant drug use. Conclusion: Adjusted for confounders, NGAL plasma levels are increased in depressed older persons, without any effect of antidepressant medication and age of onset. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: It is {{increasingly}} recognized that a <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> of systemic <b>inflammation</b> occurs {{in patients with}} advanced {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of systemic chronic inflammatory response, has been related with decreased survival in large cohorts of COPD patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a 12 -month retrospective study involving 55 out-patients with COPD (FEV 1 59 +/- 23 % pred.) examined in stable conditions, inspiratory capacity (IC) was measured at rest and considered as index of DH when lower than 80 % predicted. Simultaneously, CRP (by immuno-turbidometry) and white blood cells (WBC), uric acid and alpha- 1 globulins were measured in the venous blood in the morning before eating. RESULTS: CRP was significantly increased in the COPD patients with IC 80 % pred. (n = 20; IC = 97 + 13 % pred.), amounting to 0. 70 +/- 0. 59 vs 0. 29 +/- 0. 28 mg/dl, respectively (p < 0. 01). CRP was inversely related to IC (% pred.) (r = 0. 45, p < 0. 01). WBC, serum uric acid (an endogenous danger signal), and albumin and alfa- 1 globulins were not different between the two groups. DISCUSSION: These results show that the IC reduction is associated with higher serum levels of CRP in stable COPD patients, suggesting a potential role of dynamic pulmonary hyperinflation on development and maintenance of <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> systemic <b>inflammation</b> in COPD...|$|R
40|$|A {{combination}} of metformin (MF) (2 g daily) and pioglitazone (PG) (30 mg daily) in 57 patients with {{coronary heart disease}} (CHD) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM 2) reduces the indicators of <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> chronic <b>inflammation</b> (CI) : tumor necrosis factor alpha in blood — by 5 times in 6 months of treatment, interleukin- 6 — by a 4 times compared to baseline. This combination is safe, has a positive clinical effect on CHD and more effectively normalizes glycated hemoglobin level in patients compared with a {{combination of}} MF and sulfonylurea. Since CI is a trigger for the development of atherosclerosis, CHD, arterial hypertension and DM 2, a combination of MF and PG should be considered as an effective and safe agent for the prevention and treatment of these diseases that is confirmed by analysis of modern scientific literature...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Obesity {{is closely}} related to chronic, <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> {{systemic}} <b>inflammation</b> (metaflammation) and it leads to further metabolic complications such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, and type 2 diabetes due to the adipocytokine imbalance. This study was carried out to assess the correlation between progranulin, granulin, adiponectin and visceral adipose tissue-derived serine protease inhibitor (Vaspin) with metaflammation (high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)) in centrally obese men. METHODS: This study was observational with a cross sectional design involving 60 men aged 30 - 60 years, consisted of 43 obese men (waist circumference (WC) ≥ 90 cm) and 13 non obese men (WC 105 cm. CONCLUSION: We found metaflammation (hs-CRP) was significantly correlated with Vaspin, but not with progranulin, granulin and adiponectin, in obese men. We suggest the possibility of a dynamic expression of adipokines related to WC that are subjected to adipocytes hypertrophy-hyperplasia phenomenon...|$|R
