500|$|A Season 8 scene - {{cut from}} its {{intended}} episode due to time constraints - showed Catherine Willows visiting Grissom's apartment to update {{him on a}} case. While {{he is in his}} bedroom, she snoops around and finds a woman's dressing robe in his closet. She then notices a photograph of Gil and Sara together on the fridge. When Grissom emerges from his room, she asks him [...] "How <b>long</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> and Sara been together?" [...] He tries to make a quick exit but not before she tells him she'd always thought he was a lonely bachelor, to which his response is to laugh and leave.|$|E
500|$|Music {{featured}} {{regularly on}} the show, often with Wood singing self-penned songs accompanying {{herself on the}} piano. The best-remembered tune from the show is the seven-minute-long [...] "The Ballad of Barry and Freda – Let's Do It". It concerns a couple, Barry and Freda; she is hungry for sex, he isn't. It climaxes with the lines [...] "beat me on the bottom with a Woman's Weekly, let's do it! Let's do it tonight!". The song was performed numerous times by Wood in her live performances. Wood said of the number: [...] "A joy to write, a sod to learn, and I daren't finish a show without it. The first time I performed it, {{a woman at the}} stage door asked, 'How <b>long</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> been cross-eyed?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{number of}} {{previous}} incarnations of the Doctor {{was at first}} unclear within the series. In the Fourth Doctor story The Brain of Morbius, the Doctor participates in a mental ‘duel’ with another Time Lord and the machine to which their minds are connected begins to project {{the faces of the}} [...] "losing" [...] contestant’s regenerations in chronologically descending order. As the Doctor is overpowered by Morbius, the images change successively to those of the third, second and first Doctors, then eight further faces appear. It was the intention of producer Philip Hinchcliffe and script editor Robert Holmes that images were even earlier incarnations of the Doctor. However, the narrative does not explicitly confirm that the faces do represent incarnations of the Doctor, even though, as the faces are shown, Morbius cries [...] "How far Doctor? How <b>long</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> lived?", indicating that they are not incarnations of Morbius, but rather that it is the Doctor's past being shown.|$|E

2500|$|On {{his coming}} to Town for the Winter, as he {{generally}} does, {{he went to}} the Levee with the Duke of Portland, who went with Lord William to kiss hands on his going into the Guards—while Lord William was kissing hands, The King was talking to The Duke, but his Eyes were fixed on [...] who was standing in the Crowd, and when He said His say to The Duke, without waiting for 's coming up in his turn, The King went up to him, and, after the usual questions of how <b>long</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> been in Town and the weather, He said you have been very much employed of late, and very much confined. [...] said, no, Sir, not more than usual—You have and very well employed too, but there are none so deaf as those that w'ont hear, and none so blind as those that w'ont see— made a low bow, Sir, I certainly now understand you, but was afraid my vanity or presumption might have led me to imagine what Your Majesty has said referred to what I have done—You cannot be vain—You have been of use to us all, it is a general opinion, is it not so Lord Stair? who was standing near. It is said Lord Stair;—Your Majesty's adopting it, Sir, will make the opinion general, said —I know it is the general opinion, and I know that there is no Man who calls himself a Gentleman that must not think himself obliged to you, for you have supported the cause of the Gentlemen—You know the tone at Court is a whisper, but The King said all this loud, so as to be heard by every one at Court.|$|E
