40|$|The {{observation}} that <b>liquidations</b> {{are concentrated in}} recessions {{has long been the}} subject of controversy. One view holds that <b>liquidations</b> are beneficial in that they result in increased restructuring. Another view holds that <b>liquidations</b> are privately inefficient and essentially wasteful. This paper proposes an alternative perspective. Based on a combination of theory and empirical evidence on gross job flows and on financial and labor market rents, we find that, cumulatively, recessions result in reduced restructuring, and that this is likely to be socially costly once we consider inefficiencies on both the creation and destruction margins. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of creditors' voluntary <b>liquidations</b> (CVLs), an area of research that has received comparatively scant attention in the literature despite the fact that, {{at least in the}} UK, this form of insolvency has consistently comprised the majority of company failures. It develops an equilibrium correction model to explain variations in the aggregate number of creditors' voluntary <b>liquidations</b> in England and Wales between 1963 and 1995. This is then subjected to out-of-sample testing over the subsequent ten-year period. The results indicate that in both the short-run and the long-run, changes in the level of <b>liquidations</b> can be explained by two main explanatory variables namely: the nominal after-tax cost of borrowing and changes in real economic activity. In addition, confirmatory evidence is provided of the dampening effect of the 1986 Insolvency Act on the number of <b>liquidations.</b> The model retains its forecasting accuracy in the out-of-sample period although there is possibly some preliminary evidence of a further mitigating effect associated with the Enterprise Act 2002...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{the factors}} {{determining}} corporate <b>liquidations</b> is one ingredient of prudent banking. This article investigates these in a UK context.

In the subsequent recovery, however, rising GDP relative to trend and other macroeconomic factors {{seem to have had}} greater explanatory power than changes in company finances in accounting for the fall in the corporate <b>liquidations</b> rate to its currently low level.

40|$|Prior LIFO {{studies have}} assumed that a LIFO-use firm will avoid liquidating old {{low-cost}} inventory layers due to the resulting tax penalty.

This leads to the prediction that low marginal tax rate LIFO firms account {{for the majority of}} LIFO <b>liquidations.</b> Using several measures of a firm's marginal tax rate, and controlling for other potential determinants of LIFO <b>liquidations,</b> this prediction receives strong empirical support.
