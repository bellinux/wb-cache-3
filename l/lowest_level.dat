40|$|Hyperheuristics {{give us the}} {{appealing}} {{possibility of}} abstracting the solution method from the problem, since our hyperheuristic, at each decision point, chooses between different <b>low</b> <b>level</b> heuristics rather than different solutions as is usually the case for metaheuristics. By assembling <b>low</b> <b>level</b> heuristics from parameterised components we may create {{hundreds or thousands of}} <b>low</b> <b>level</b> heuristics, and there is increasing evidence that this is effective in dealing with every eventuality that may arise when solving different combinatorial optimisation problem instances since at each iteration the solution landscape is amenable to {{at least one of the}} <b>low</b> <b>level</b> heuristics. However, the large number of <b>low</b> <b>level</b> heuristics means that the hyperheuristic has to intelligently select the correct <b>low</b> <b>level</b> heuristic to use, to make best use of available CPU time. This paper empirically investigates several hyperheuristics designed for large collections of <b>low</b> <b>level</b> heuristics and adapts other hyperheuristics from the literature to cope with these large sets of <b>low</b> <b>level</b> heuristics on a difficult real- world workforce scheduling problem. In the process we empirically investigate a wide range of approaches for setting tabu tenure in hyperheuristic methods, for a complex real-world problem. The results show that the hyperheuristic methods described provide a good way to trade off CPU time and solution quality...|$|R
