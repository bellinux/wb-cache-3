40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{designs of}} self-timed dual-sum single-carry or dual-bit adder function blocks, constructed using commercially available synchronous library resources (standard cells) and validated using synchronous tools. Specifically, the proposed adder modules qualify as either quasi-delay-insensitive or speed-independent and satisfy Seitz’s weak-indication timing constraints. The delay-insensitive {{version of the}} ripple carry adder topology {{has been used to}} analyze the designs. The indication (completion) is either made implicit in the topology (<b>local</b> <b>indication)</b> or considerably isolated from the actual data path (a new variant of global indication). The proposed adders are found to exhibit improved power and performance parameters, whilst being competitive in terms of area, in comparison with those pertaining to other self-timed logic realizations...|$|E

It performed a literature review based on scientific article published between the years 2013 - 2016, seeking to indicate the main bio-indicators species of lichens and individual trees, {{as well as the}} <b>local</b> <b>indication</b> that favors the highest concentration of atmospheric pollutant. The most studied species of lichens were Flavoparmelia caperata (L.) Evernia prunastri (L.) Ach., Parmelia sulcata Taylor, L. Pseudevernia furfuracea Zopf, all cited in at least two studies. By contrast, the forest species have been little studied preventing the indication of the species that are considered bioindicators, requiring further study. The concentrations of PAHs and heavy metals in the atmosphere influence the diversity and distribution of species of both lichens, as the tree species, which may be related to sensitivity that one may have in relation to the other. Such concentrations are influenced by climate change, humidity, wind direction, altitude, different uses and occupation, distance and type of pollution. The bioindicators raised proved to be quite relevant, however it lacks a methodological standardization, hindering greater intraspecific and interspecific comparisons...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{authors of}} this article ‘Measuring the {{vulnerability}} of sub-national regions in South Africa’ (Naudé, McGillivray and Rossouw  2009 b) present an exploration into economic vulnerability from a sub-national perspective. It is an important contribution because it recognises the heterogeneous nature of vulnerability across areas within a country, but its analysis is aspatial {{because it does not}} explicitly account for the relative location of or the potential for spillovers between areas. Aim: This article aims to provide a purely methodological contribution towards the debate surrounding the measurement of multidimensional vulnerability by: (1) augmenting Naudé et al. (2009 b) ’s model to take account of spatial contiguity, (2) comparing spatial and aspatial local vulnerability indices estimates to illustrate the presence and importance of spatial spillovers between contiguous areas and (3) extending their methodology on the Vulnerability Intervention Index to present results which highlight areas that are performing better and worse than expected. Methods: Principal components analysis, queen-contiguity weight matrix and <b>local</b> <b>indication</b> of spatial association (LISA) maps were utilised. Results: Application of the methodological extensions to South African Magisterial District data illustrates the presence and importance of spatial spillovers in shaping local vulnerability. Conclusions: Our results illustrate a clear urban–rural vulnerability divide and the need for appropriate policy. It is argued that account of spatial spillovers is an important issue if full and accurate vulnerability indices are to be identified...|$|E

This study aims to assess the rates and causes of revision TKA in Kashani Hospital (Isfahan, Iran) from 2011 to 2013. Materials and Methods: We assessed all primary TKA and revision TKA procedures performed from 2011 to 2013 for the rate and causes of failures. Demographic data, duration from primary TKA to revision TKA and underlying diagnosis for primary TKA were also assessed. Results: Overall, 353 primary TKA procedures carried out in this period. The overall revisions following primary TKA in this period was 24 cases, indicating a revision burden of 6. 8 %. The most common cause of revision TKA was infection, which was in 16 cases (44. 4 %). Other causes included patellar complications, mechanical loosening of both tibia and femur, mechanical loosening of tibia, instability, and periprosthetic fracture. The main revision procedures were all component revision, tibial component revision, isolated tibial insert exchange and patellar tendon repair. The most common revision procedure was two stage all component revision, which was carried out in 13 subjects (36. 1 %).

40|$|Identifying {{environmentally}} driven {{changes in}} traits that serve an ecological function {{is essential for}} predicting evolutionary outcomes of climate change. We examined population genetic structure, sex-specific dispersal patterns, and morphology in relation to rainfall patterns across an island and three peninsulas in South Australia. The study system was the New Holland Honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae), a nectarivorous passerine that is a key pollinator species. We predicted that rainfall-related mechanisms would be driving local adaptation of morphological traits, such that in areas of lower rainfall, where nectar is less available, more insectivorous traits – shorter, deeper bills, longer tarsi, and longer wings – would be favored. The study populations differed in phenotype across the Eyre, Yorke, and Fleurieu Peninsulas and Kangaroo Island despite high gene flow (single continuous population) and sex-biased dispersal (males were philopatric and females dispersed). We tested the role of rainfall in shaping the observed phenotypic differences, and found strong support for our predicted relationships: birds in areas of higher rainfall had higher condition indices, as well as longer bill-head length, deeper bills, and shorter tarsi. Bill depth in males in high-rainfall sites showed signals of stabilizing selection, suggesting local adaptation. In addition to these <b>local</b> <b>indications</b> of selection, a global pattern of directional selection toward larger size for bill-head length, bill-nostril length, and wing length was also observed. We suggest this pattern may reflect an adaptive response to the relatively dry conditions that South Australia has experienced over the last decade. We conclude that rainfall has shaped aspects of phenology in P. novaehollandiae, both locally, with different patterns of stabilizing and directional selection, and globally, with evidence of adaptive divergence at a landscape scale.

40|$|A {{number of}} factors have contributed to {{increased}} pressure on plant operating efficiency in the chemical processing industry. These factors include more stringent environmental and safety regulations, global economic pressures and downsizing of many support services {{in order to save}} money. Control performance monitoring is a tool that is used to keep control systems performing as optimally as possible. Various performance metrics and methods exist to evaluate plant operation. In essence, however, they all refer to the same principle which is to indicate how far a plant is operating from its inherent optimum {{and what can be done}} to ensure that the gap between the optimum and the current operation is as small as possible over the longest possible period. Performance monitoring is, although well researched, not a generic, complete and specific application. Current shortcomings of monitoring applications include the following; they are process or unit operation specific and they provide <b>local</b> <b>indications</b> of performance and do not provide a plant wide evaluation of how close the plant is operating to its inherent optimum. Performance reports are usually in terms of statistical measures and graphics which are usually abstract and vague. For high level decisions making (on operation end economic investment) simple and quantifiable measures are needed that are repeatable and transparent. The focus of this project was to develop and implement a regulatory performance monitoring structure for real-time application on an industrial pilot scale distillation column. The structure was implemented by means of two graphical interfaces. The first interface provides a holistic plantwide indication of performance and indicates sources of poor performance in the regulatory control structure. The plantwide interface includes a proposed plant wide performance index (PWI) that reduces operational efficiency to one specific number. The second interface supplements the plantwide interface by providing statistical information on individual loop performance. The individual loop interface is a tool to locate causes of poor performance in the regulatory control structure to aid controller and plant maintenance.

40|$|As {{the size}} and {{complexity}} of distribution networks is increasing, remote operated switches {{are being used to}} make the grid smarter. The distribution network is being continuously reconfigured to improve the voltage profile, reduce losses and to supply to a large number of customers. Consequently, when an outage occurs on this dynamically changing grid, it is difficult and time consuming to pin-point the location of the outage. In order to overcome this problem, fault passage indicators (FPIs) are installed at strategic locations on feeders at the branching points. FPI is a device which provides a remote and <b>local</b> visual <b>indication</b> of the occurrence of fault even after the isolation of line. While the technology of FPI is established, in this thesis, algorithms which are not sensitive to network reconfigurations, are presented for fast identification of fault location, based on the statuses of multiple FPIs received at the utility control center.

40|$|This paper {{uses the}} Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) {{framework}} to analyse {{the missing links}} in attempts {{to address the problems}} of flooding in Nigerian cities. Previous flooding and the recent ones have been attributed to heavy downpour, blockage of water channels and drainages, indiscriminate dumping of refuse and building of houses along channels. Areas that are neglected but pertinent to flood mitigation include: (1) degreening activities that remove green cover; (2) paving of open spaces with asphalt and concrete that accentuate storm water volume as percolation is reduced; and (3) unpaved surfaces that generate debris and silts that cause siltation and sedimentation of Atlantic Ocean and Lagoon with the consequence of rising sea level and coastal flooding.

40|$|Fifteen {{percent to}} {{twenty-five percent of}} {{patients}} affected by colorectal cancer presents with liver metastases at diagnosis. In resectable cases, surgery is the only potentially curative treatment and achieves survival rates up to 50 % at 5 years. Management is complex, as colorectal resection, liver resection, chemotherapy, and, in locally advanced mid/low rectal tumors, radiotherapy have to be integrated. Modern medical practice usually relies on evidence-based protocols. Levels of evidence for synchronous metastases are poor: published studies include few recent prospective series and several retrospective analyses collecting {{a limited number of}} patients across long periods of time. Data are difficult to be generalized and are mainly representative of single centre&#x 2019;s experience, biased by <b>local</b> recruitment, <b>indications</b> and surgical technique. In this context, surgeons have to renounce to &#x 201 C;evidence-based medicine&#x 201 D; and to adopt a sort of &#x 201 C;experience-based medicine&#x 201 D;. Anyway, some suggestions are possible. Simultaneous colorectal and liver resection can be safely performed whenever minor hepatectomies are planned, while a case-by-case evaluation is mandatory in case of more complex procedures. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is preferentially scheduled for patients with advanced metastatic tumors to assess disease biology and to control lesions. It can be safely performed with primary tumor in situ, even planning simultaneous resection at its end. Locally advanced mid/low rectal tumor represents a further indication to neoadjuvant therapies, even if treatment&#x 2019;s schedule is not yet standardized.

The effect of dam-age in limiting or eliminating local stresses is determined in terms of auxiliary transformation stresses.

Nevertheless this approach is restricted to patients unsuspected of multiglandular disease, free from thyroid disease and for whom localization studies are contributive.

Intervention decreased azithromycin consumption and expenditure but its effect was offset by increased con-sumption of other agents, mainly amoxicillin. Interventions in primary care settings should target prescribing behavior through a multifaceted approach to increase efficacy while preventing a trade-off effec...|$|R
40|$|Corneal {{clouding}} or opacification is {{a prominent}} feature of mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS), particularly in MPS I and VI. In patients with marked corneal clouding and visual impairment, penetrating keratoplasty {{may be considered}} to improve the patient's vision, functional capacity and quality of life. In MPS, glycosaminoglycans mainly accumulate in the corneal stroma and not in Descemet's membrane or the endothelium, therefore deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) may be preferred in these patients over penetrating keratoplasty. Although there are only limited data {{on the use of}} DALK in MPS (I and VI) patients, the results are generally favourable. Nonetheless, when deciding on whether to perform keratoplasty in patients with MPS, the risk of general anaesthesia due to potential concomitant cardio-pulmonary problems and cervical spine instability, the potential presence of other ocular manifestations that also impair vision (e. g. glaucoma, retinal degeneration and optic atrophy) and/or complications such as allograft rejection and the risk of re-opacification of the graft, all need to be taken into consideration. Limbal stem cell transplantation, which can be combined with keratoplasty, also holds potential promise in the treatment of these complex cases. A review of the <b>indications,</b> <b>local</b> and systemic risks, techniques of lamellar andpenetrating keratoplasty, and the potential of limbal stem cell transplantation is provided in the context of corneal opacity in MPS...|$|R
40|$|Risk {{factors for}} <b>local</b> {{recurrence}} and <b>indication</b> for preoperative radiation therapy {{have not been}} well evaluated for patients undergoing laparoscopic rectal cancer operation. From 1998 to 2004, 497 T 3 rectal cancer patients with tumor located within 12 cm from the anal verge who had undergone laparoscopic surgery without preoperative radiation therapy by eight experienced laparoscopic surgeons in four Asian countries were reviewed retrospectively for the incidence of local recurrence and related factors. The median follow-up was 29. 0 months (range, 6. 0 to 92. 3), and 31 cases of local recurrence were observed during the follow-up period (6 anastomosis site, 6 perineum, 17 pelvic wall, and 2 unclassified). The estimated local recurrence rates at 24 and 60 months were 5. 42 and 9. 41 %, respectively. Patient's gender, tumor location, lymph node metastasis, and tumor perforation were independent factors for local recurrence by multivariate analysis. The local recurrence rate was comparable to previous studies using conventional open surgery with preoperative chemoradiation, except for a subgroup of male patients with the tumor located within 7 cm from the anal verge. The indication for preoperative radiation therapy would be different from those who will undergo conventional open surgery, and further evaluation {{of the benefits of}} preoperative radiation therapy is required for those with low risk tumor. © 2007 The Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONLaparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) is well {{recognized}} for its efficiency in morbidly obese patients. Anastomotic strictures present in 5 – 15 % of cases {{and have a}} significant impact on the patient's quality of life. Endoscopic balloon dilation is the recommended treatment but management of refractory cases is challenging. PRESENTATION OF CASETwo patients with anastomotic stenoses refractory to dilations were treated with fully covered esophageal stents. Both cases presented early stent migration. The first patient finally underwent surgical revision of the anastomosis. For the second patient, a double-layered stent was installed after the first incident. After the migration of this second stent, three sessions of intralesional injection of triamcinolone acetonide were performed. Both patients were free of obstructive symptoms at a follow-up of 9 months. DISCUSSIONTreatment of post-gastric bypass strictures with stents is based on years of successful experience with endoscopic stenting of malignant esophageal strictures, gastric outlet obstruction in addition to anastomotic stenoses after esophageal cancer surgery. The actual prosthesis are however inadequate for the particularities of the LRYGB anastomosis with a high migration rate. Intralesional corticosteroid injection therapy has been reported to be beneficial in the management of refractory benign esophageal strictures and seems to have prevented recurrence of the stenosis in this post-LRYGB. CONCLUSIONStents are aimed at preventing a complex surgical reintervention but are not yet specifically designed for that <b>indication.</b> <b>Local</b> infiltration of corticosteroids at the time of dilation may prevent recurrence of the anastomotic stricture...|$|R
