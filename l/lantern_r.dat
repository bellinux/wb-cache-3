50|$|Academic {{histories}} in China {{mentioned the}} <b>Red</b> <b>Lanterns</b> only in passing, even after 1949, when the Boxer movement {{was considered a}} patriotic uprising of the masses. But suddenly in 1967, the <b>Red</b> <b>Lanterns</b> became hot topics in the national media. The Cultural Revolution was at its most radical phase, and the radical student youth groups, the Red Guards, reached the heights of their fervor. Like them, the <b>Red</b> <b>Lanterns</b> were red, young and rebellious, and one Red Guard group chose the name “Red Lantern Fighting Force.” The Model Revolutionary Opera, the <b>Red</b> <b>Lantern,</b> produced by Mao Zedong’s wife, Jiang Qing, had no connection to the Boxer movement, but popularized the <b>Red</b> <b>Lantern</b> into a revolutionary symbol. A campaign in official Party newspapers saw a direct connection with the <b>Red</b> <b>Lanterns</b> of 1900. Official editorials attacked Liu Shaoqi, Mao’s former second in command, for detesting the Boxers, and called upon the Red Guards {{to carry on the}} spirit of the <b>Red</b> <b>Lanterns.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Critical {{reception}} for the <b>Red</b> <b>Lantern</b> Corps has been mixed. Their first appearance, during the Final Crisis event in 2008, {{was met with}} a mostly positive critical response. Jesse Schedeen, writing for IGN, remarked that [...] "the <b>Red</b> <b>Lanterns</b> are an excellent addition to the increasingly crowded Lantern mythos." [...] J. Montes, writing for Weekly Comic Book Review, noted that [...] "The <b>Red</b> <b>Lanterns</b> are vicious and make the relentlessness of the Sinestro Corps almost wimpy by comparison." [...] Likewise, <b>Red</b> <b>Lantern</b> Bleez's origin story, as told in Blackest Night: Tales of the Corps #2, received widespread praise, particularly for Eddie Barrows's artwork.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Red</b> <b>Lantern</b> Corps are {{the primary}} antagonists of the first arc of Green Lantern: The Animated Series, however {{there are a number}} of {{differences}} between their representation on the show and how they appear in the comic. This version of the <b>Red</b> <b>Lantern</b> Corps is not mindless, for instance, and all of the members depicted appear to be fully in control of their actions. The energy produced by their rings also does not produce persistent damage effects or increased violent tendencies in their targets (although it is demonstrated on multiple occasions to be more powerful than Green Lantern energy in sheer output), and <b>Red</b> <b>Lantern</b> rings can be removed without instantly killing the user in this continuity. In this version, <b>Red</b> <b>Lantern</b> energy isn't necessarily a negative emotion, depending on the user and their intentions, as [...] "anger" [...] is part of the emotions of sentient life. While the version in the comics was blind, unthinking rage, the TV series version of <b>Red</b> <b>Lantern</b> energy is said to cover a broad definition of [...] "anger", ranging from [...] "rage" [...] on one end, but also [...] "righteous fury" [...] on the other. The <b>Red</b> <b>Lantern</b> Corps organization under Atrocitus, however, focuses on rage. Membership is voluntary, with the organization preaching a fascist protectionist ethos. There also appears to be a Cult of Personality centered around the veneration of Atrocitus as a prophet figure. It has been revealed that while membership is voluntary, Atrocitus has on at least one occasion plunged an entire planet into generations of war simply to produce a single <b>Red</b> <b>Lantern</b> candidate, manipulating the entire life of Razer in order to fill him with hate. So far, Zilius Zox, Atrocitus, Bleez, [...] Veon, and Skallox have all appeared as members of the animated <b>Red</b> <b>Lantern</b> Corps. New members that are original to the series include Razer - a 'reformed' <b>Red</b> <b>Lantern</b> who sought to escape his past by working with Hal and Kilowog - Cleric Loran, and Ragnar. Their powers are negated by the proximity of Blue Lantern Corps energy, although extreme anger or [...] "righteous fury" [...] can overcome that weakness.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the events}} of [...] "Blackest Night", Guy Gardner starred in the monthly series Emerald Warriors, written by Peter Tomasi. While searching for a cure for his <b>Red</b> <b>Lantern</b> rage, it is {{revealed}} that Guy entered into an alliance with <b>Red</b> <b>Lantern</b> leader Atrocitus, which briefly alienates Guy from Kilowog and Arisia.|$|R

A <b>Red</b> <b>Lantern</b> power ring finds her and attaches to her, transforming her into a <b>Red</b> <b>Lantern.</b> Driven insane by rage, Kara wanders space, attacking everyone in her way, until captured by several Green Lanterns and brought to Hal Jordan. Immediately recognizing a Kryptonian and unable to remove the power ring without killing her, he brings her to Guy Gardner, the leader {{of one of the}} two <b>Red</b> <b>Lantern</b> factions, who manages to restore her sanity.|$|R
