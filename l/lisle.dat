5|$|Brock {{was born}} at St Peter Port on the Channel Island of Guernsey, the eighth son of John Brock (1729–1777), a {{midshipman}} in the Royal Navy, and Elizabeth de <b>Lisle,</b> daughter of Daniel de <b>Lisle,</b> then Lieutenant-Bailiff of Guernsey. The Brocks were an English family who had been established in Guernsey since the sixteenth century. Brock earned a reputation during his early education on Guernsey as an assiduous student, {{as well as an}} exceptional swimmer and boxer. At age ten, he was sent to school in Southampton. He also studied for one year in Rotterdam, learning French.|$|E
5|$|Elementary {{schooling}} at {{the orphanage}} featured better equipped classrooms {{than the original}} building. A few years after operations moved in 1911, the school offered a two-year business program. By 1948 the orphanage comprised the <b>Lisle</b> Manual Training School for Boys and the <b>Lisle</b> Industrial School for Girls, {{both of which were}} managed by the Sisters of St. Benedict and run by the Archdiocese of Chicago. In the 1950s Petru Hall was built as an annex {{on the east side of}} the dormitory building.|$|E
5|$|John became king in 1199 after Richard's death. William de Ferrers, 4th Earl of Derby {{maintained}} {{the claim of}} the Earls of Derby to the Peveril estates. He paid King John 2000marks (£1333) for the lordship of the Peak, but the Crown retained possession of Peveril and Bolsover Castles. John finally gave Ferrers these castles in 1216 to secure his support {{in the face of}} country-wide rebellion. However, the castellan Brian de <b>Lisle</b> refused to hand them over. Although de <b>Lisle</b> and Ferrers were both King John's supporters, the king gave Ferrers permission to use force to retake the castles.|$|E

5|$|Jane Dudley {{served as}} a lady-in-waiting to Anne Boleyn, and later to Anne of Cleves. She was {{interested}} in the Reformed religion and, with her husband, moved in evangelical circles from the mid-1530s. In 1542 John Dudley was created Viscount <b>Lisle.</b> He was on friendly terms with William Parr, whose sister Catherine became Henry VIII's last queen in July 1543. As one of her closest friends, the Viscountess <b>Lisle</b> was among the four ladies leading her to the altar on the marriage day. Jane Dudley belonged also to the courtly sympathizers of Anne Askew, whom she contacted during her imprisonment in 1545–1546. The forthright Protestant was burnt at the stake as a heretic in July 1546 on the contrivance of the religiously conservative court party around Bishop Stephen Gardiner.|$|E

5|$|Ravel's songs often draw on vernacular styles, using {{elements}} of many folk traditions in such works as Cinq mélodies populaires grecques, Deux mélodies hébraïques and Chants populaires. Among the poets on whose lyrics he drew were Marot, Léon-Paul Fargue, Leconte de <b>Lisle</b> and Verlaine. For three songs dating from 1914–15 {{he wrote his}} own texts.|$|E
5|$|The academy was {{primarily}} a boarding school. Students came from Illinois, the surrounding states, Texas, and Mexico. A few day students came from the <b>Lisle</b> area. In 1947 enrollment averaged 75students. Enrollment grew from 120 in 1953 to 300 in 1958, and remained at that level until 1966. Day student enrollment also grew and in 1962 the academy stopped accepting boarding school students. By 1964, the last year in which boarding school students were enrolled, alumni had hailed from all US states, South America, France, Mexico, and Guam. Day students from 1964 to 1968 came from <b>Lisle</b> and the neighboring communities. Unlike St. Procopius Academy, Sacred Heart Academy offered a business curriculum from 1953 to 1966. Courses included shorthand, typewriting, and bookkeeping.|$|E
5|$|After {{two and a}} half years, {{the family}} {{returned}} to Kentucky, where Beshear had joined the Lexington law firm of Harbison, Kessinger, <b>Lisle</b> and Bush. He went into practice for himself in 1974. Taking on partners, he formed the law firm of Beshear, Meng, and Green. He led the firm until his election as attorney general in 1979.|$|E

Michael Rimington 6th Dragoons, commanded the Indian Cavalry Corps. Altogether during the First World War, the British cavalry provided ten corps and twenty-seven divisional commanders.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} the {{resistance}} was to topple Somerset as Lord Protector, so that in 1549 it was feared by some that the Reformation would cease. The prayer book was the tipping point. But <b>Lisle,</b> now made Earl of Warwick, was made Lord President of the Privy Council and, ever the opportunist (he died a public Roman Catholic), he saw the further implementation of the reforming policy {{as a means of}} defeating his rivals.|$|E
5|$|By 1912, the {{community}} of nuns had outgrown their convent in Chicago, and relocated to the new Convent of the Sacred Heart in <b>Lisle.</b> They had prospered there as a teaching order educating Slovak-speaking nuns and organized two Slovak schools. In 1926, {{under the leadership of}} Mother Mary Genevieve, the convent founded a day and boarding high school for girls—the Sacred Heart Academy. The academy outgrew its space and in 1929 the convent was expanded to accommodate rising enrollment. The annexed facilities reserved for the school included a Renaissance-style chapel, an auditorium, and a gymnasium. The Academy was later expanded to include the Jaeger Junior College.|$|E
5000|$|... 46 {{years later}} (1876), <b>Lisle's</b> {{population}} had fallen dramatically to 400, likely {{because of a}} flood, but the exact reason for this decline is unknown.|$|R

5|$|Lord Guildford Dudley was {{the second}} {{youngest}} surviving son of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, and his wife, Jane Guildford. The Dudley lineage goes back to a family called Sutton. In the early 14th century they became the lords of Dudley Castle, from whom Guildford descended through his paternal grandfather. This was Edmund Dudley, a councillor of Henry VII, who was executed after his royal master's death. Through his father's mother, Elizabeth Grey, Viscountess <b>Lisle,</b> Guildford descended from the Hundred Years War heroes, Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, and John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury.|$|E
5|$|Near the {{entrance}} to site is situated a memorial to the 29th British Division, the division of which the Newfoundland Regiment was a part. Lieutenant-General Beauvoir De <b>Lisle,</b> wartime commander of the 29th British Division, unveiled the monument {{the morning of the}} official opening of the site on 7 June 1925. Each wartime unit of the 29th British Division sent a representative to form a guard of honour for the occasion. Afterwards, this detachment, joined by French infantry from Arras formed the honour guard for the unveiling of the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial.|$|E
5|$|The 99 {{surviving}} {{defenders of}} the 2nd Norfolks were eventually ordered by their commander Major <b>Lisle</b> Ryder, the brother of Robert Edward Dudley Ryder, to surrender and they left the cowshed {{that they had been}} defending under a white flag. Due to the boundary between the two British regiments being the road, Ryder's men surrendered not to the company they had been fighting, but rather to SS-Hauptsturmführer Fritz Knöchlein's unit, which had been fighting the Royal Scots. Graves found near Le Paradis in 2007 suggest that around 20men of the Royal Scots who surrendered to an SS unit may also have been killed in a separate massacre.|$|E

5|$|The square {{lies within}} an area bound by <b>Lisle</b> Street, to the north; Charing Cross Road, to the east; Orange Street, to the south; and Whitcomb Street, to the west. The {{park at the}} centre of the Square is bound by Cranbourn Street, to the north; Leicester Street, to the east; Irving Street, to the south; and a section of road {{designated}} simply as Leicester Square, to the west. It is within the City of Westminster, north of Trafalgar Square, east of Piccadilly Circus, west of Covent Garden, and south of Cambridge Circus.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose Dudley was {{the fourth}} son of Sir John Dudley, later Viscount <b>Lisle,</b> Earl of Warwick and Duke of Northumberland, and his wife Jane Guildford. The Dudleys had 13 {{children}} in all and were known for their Protestant leanings {{as well as for}} their happy family life. Ambrose Dudley and his brothers were trained by, among others, the mathematician John Dee and the rhetorician Thomas Wilson. In August 1549 Dudley went to Norfolk with his father and his younger brother Robert to fight against the rebel peasant army of Robert Kett. Back in London, Dudley was knighted and married Anne Whorwood, daughter of William Whorwood, deceased Attorney-General. In 1552 they had a daughter who died soon. Anne also died in 1552 of the sweating sickness. Dudley soon married for the second time: Elizabeth Lady Tailboys (or Talboys, 15201563), who was a baroness in her own right with large possessions in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Dudley was one {{of three}} sons of Edmund Dudley, a {{councillor}} of King Henry VII, and his second wife Elizabeth Grey, daughter of Edward Grey, 4th Viscount <b>Lisle.</b> When he was a toddler, his father was executed by the young Henry VIII as a scapegoat for the former king's financial policies. His eldest brother was John Dudley, later Duke of Northumberland, who sought to advance him in the king's service. Andrew Dudley served in the household of Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, and as an officer of the exchequer in the 1540s. Answering a complaint against exchequer activities in October 1540, Norfolk told the Privy Council that the only two people he had ever found jobs for were Andrew Dudley and Edward Belingeham.|$|E

60|$|The {{girl was}} less {{astonished}} than gratified. Gladwyne {{was surprised and}} disconcerted. He had said nothing to Batley about Crestwick, but he had noticed <b>Lisle's</b> warning glance, and the other's prompt acquiescence appeared significant. It {{looked as if the}} two had joined hands, and that was what he most dreaded. An almost overpowering rage against the Canadian possessed him. When he attempted to mount, the chestnut gave him trouble by backing and plunging; but the bay was quiet and Nasmyth stood for a few moments by <b>Lisle's</b> stirrup.|$|R
50|$|On 13th the Botha's army {{retreated to}} the north, they were chased as far as Elands River Station, only 25 miles from Pretoria, by Mounted Infantry and De <b>Lisle's</b> Australians.|$|R
