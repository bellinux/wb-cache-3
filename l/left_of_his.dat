5|$|By 8:30pm on {{the evening}} of March 18, most of {{northern}} Quảng Trị was under North Vietnamese control. ARVN Colonel Do Ky, also the provincial chief of Quảng Trị Province, tried to lead what was <b>left</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> troops back to Huế but was pursued by the North Vietnamese along National Highway 1 until they reached An Lo.|$|E
5|$|On March 11 Thieu {{convened a}} meeting with Prime Minister Trần Thiện Khiêm, Chief of the ARVN General Staff General Cao Văn Viên, and Lieutenant General Dang Van Quang to discuss the {{military}} situation in the northern provinces of South Vietnam. In this meeting, Thieu decided to withdraw what was <b>left</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> army from the northern provinces to defend the Mekong region, {{where most of the}} nation’s population and vital economic resources were located. Thieu justified his decision on the basis that the South Vietnamese military could not defend every inch of South Vietnam’s territory, so the military had to be ‘lightened at the top and heavy at the bottom’.|$|E
5|$|In {{early summer}} 1165, Pope Alexander III wrote twice to Foliot, {{ordering}} him to intercede {{with the king}} and protest the royal injunction against appeals to the papacy. Foliot replied that the king respected the pope, heard his protests carefully, and that the archbishop had not been expelled, but had <b>left</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own accord. Foliot wrote that the king had said Becket was free to return at any time, but {{would still have to}} answer to the charges he had faced at Northampton. Foliot then advised the pope not to impose any sentences of excommunication and to be patient and continue to negotiate. In 1166, Foliot accused Becket of simony, or the purchase of church offices, basing this on the alleged purchase Becket had made of the chancellorship, although {{there is no evidence that}} Becket bought the office. By 1166, the king had made Foliot the head of the English Church, in fact if not in law. The king and Foliot got along well, and it was probably Foliot's influence that kept the king from more violent measures against Becket.|$|E

25|$|Mohnke (and {{what was}} <b>left</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> group) could not {{break through the}} Soviet rings. Most were taken {{prisoner}} and some committed suicide.

The majority were killed or captured by the Soviets. The number of German soldiers and civilians killed attempting the breakout is unknown.|$|E
25|$|Early Islamic {{philosophy}} and Islamic metaphysics, imbued {{as it is}} with Islamic theology, distinguishes more clearly than Aristotelianism between essence and existence. Whereas existence is the domain of the contingent and the accidental, essence endures within a being beyond the accidental. The philosophy of Ibn Sīnā, particularly that part relating to metaphysics, owes much to al-Farabi. The search for a definitive Islamic philosophy separate from Occasionalism can be seen in what is <b>left</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work.|$|E

He anchored the <b>left</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> line on a battery positioned on the Lewiston Coaling, extending his infantry west along Lewiston Lane to the South Fork {{near the site of}} Lewis's Mill. The right and center were supported by artillery, 16 guns in all.|$|E

The cavalry regiments losing standards were the Beeren Cuirassiers Nr. 2 (5), Katte Dragoons Nr. 4 (2), Königin Dragoons Nr. 5 (1), Hertzberg Dragoons Nr. 9 (5), Heyking Dragoons Nr. 10 (5), and Wobeser Dragoons Nr. 14 (1).|$|E
25|$|Lowry {{published}} little {{during his}} lifetime, {{in comparison with}} the extensive collection of unfinished manuscripts he <b>left.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>his</b> two novels, Under the Volcano (1947) is now widely accepted as his masterpiece and one of the great works of the 20th century (number 11 on the Modern Library's 100 Best Novels of the 20th century). It exemplifies Lowry's method as a writer, which involved drawing heavily upon the autobiographical material and imbuing it with complex and allusive layers of symbolism. Under the Volcano depicts a series of complex and unwillingly destructive relationships and is set against a rich evocation of Mexico.|$|E

25|$|With Murtaza Pasha's army approaching, {{the rebels}} opted {{to abandon their}} {{positions}} in western Anatolia. Abaza Hasan returned to the region near Konya, near to where he had defeated Kara Haydaroğlu ten years previously. There, on 11 December 1658, he attacked Murtaza's army outside the town of Ilgın and inflicted on him a severe defeat, demonstrating once again his military skill. Despite this, {{the severity of the}} winter led him to continue his retreat. The rebel forces ultimately established winter quarters in the southeast Anatolian city of Ayntab (modern Gaziantep), while Murtaza and what was <b>left</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> army spent the winter in Aleppo, which had been seized from the rebels earlier in the year.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Socialist Revolutionary {{leaders in}} exile, {{many of them}} living in Switzerland, had been the glum spectators of the {{collapse}} of international socialist solidarity. French and German Social Democrats had voted in favour of their respective governments' war efforts. Georgi Plekhanov in Paris had adopted a violently anti-German stand, while Parvus supported the German war effort as the best means of ensuring a revolution in Russia. The Mensheviks largely maintained that Russia had the right to defend herself against Germany, although Martov (a prominent Menshevik), now on the <b>left</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> group, demanded an end to the war and a settlement on the basis of national self-determination, with no annexations or indemnities.|$|E
25|$|The Fall of Kaifeng {{boosted the}} morale of the Jurchens, and they {{attempted}} a third invasion. Gaozong saw little intention to make a good defense against the Jurchens. He felt the strong generals around him would make him vulnerable and wanted them to lose to remove the threat. Han facing enormous odds, was beaten off for the first time. Many of the Song generals, disgusted by the cowardly emperor, began to retaliate, and Han had to gather up what was <b>left</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> force and protect the throne. He successfully captured the renegade generals and scattered their forces. It is stated that Han actually condemned the emperor and that the emperor apologized and finally showed signs of better supporting the generals defending China.|$|E
