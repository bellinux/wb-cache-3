30|$|Yahmed et al. (2009) {{conducted}} {{an investigation of}} a pilot unit system consisting of three unit fixed bioreactors. They tested for different organic loading rate (OLR) of microbials namely Actinomycetes, Bacillus, Pseudomonas and Burkholderia {{for the removal of}} TOC. They concluded that the maximum TOC reduction by Pseudomonas isolates was of 70  %. Meanwhile, Actinomycetes isolates, Bacillus isolates and Burkholderia isolates gave 69, 69 and 77  % TOC reduction, respectively. In another study, Ellouze et al. (2008) investigated leachate treatability by utilizing sludge from a waste water treatment plant. Preliminary studies showed that the acclimatization of the sludge was able to remove organic matter and toxicity. A set up of stirred tank reactor with OLR from 0.5 to 4  g/L/day with HRT decreased from 50 to 4.6  days demonstrating that COD was removed up to 80  % for a loading rate of 5.4  g/L/day. In addition, the concentration of N–NH 4 + was reduced below to the recommended standard. Finally, the results from toxicity of Vibrio fischeri and the germination of Lepidium sativum seeds showed that the treatment was able to effectively provide detoxification of the effluent whereby the loading rate up to 6  g/L was ideal for the perturbation of the system which triggered an accumulation of residual COD and toxicity, respectively. Ismail et al. (2011) investigated the effect of different organic <b>loading</b> <b>charges</b> (0.6 – 16.3  kg) for the removal of TOC and TKN by submerged biofilm reactor. The results showed that without initial pH adjustment, TOC removal rate varied between 65 and 97  %. The total reduction of COD reached 92  % at a HRT of 36  h. However, the removal of total Kjeldahl nitrogen for <b>loading</b> <b>charges</b> of 0.5  kg N/m 3 /day reached 75  %. Further toxicity test for the removal of organic carbon and nitrogen showed that Bacillus, Actinomyces, Pseudomonas and Burkholderia genera were responsible for these occurrences. Chen et al. (2008) investigated the performance of a moving bed biofilm reactor (MMBR) via aerobic and anaerobic sequence for simultaneous removal of COD and ammonium. They discovered that anaerobic MBBR {{played a major role in}} COD removal (91  %) at OLR of 4.08  kg COD/m 3 /day due to methanogenesis and the aerobic MBBR acted as COD-polishing and ammonium removal step. In contrast, HRT at 1.25  days required to remove more than 97  % of NH 4 + of the aerobic MMBR. Bohdziewicz et al. (2008) examined the treatability of leachate by submerged membrane bioreactors. They used synthetic waste water as feeding medium by volume ratio with the addition of leachate dilution between 50 and 75  %. They claimed that higher COD removal could be achieved with the leachate addition of 10 – 20  % v/v. They also revealed that the best anaerobic digestion efficiency (COD removal 90  %) was observed for HRT for 2  days and OLR of 2.5  kg COD/m 3  days for the optimal anaerobic digestion efficiency.|$|E
40|$|Tunnels are key {{elements}} in modern traffic networks. Large-scale accidents and malicious threats, such as fires or explosions creating a blast loading, potentially carry very high economical and societal consequences. Compared to other statistically certain events, explosive-induced blasts in tunnels have an extremely low {{probability of occurrence}} {{but at the same}} time an enormous damage potential for structure, life, and environment. The paper presents a procedure for evaluation consequences of blast loading threat scenarios, focusing on the local and global structural integrity of tunnel constructions. Methods to capture the dynamic loading and the structural resistance, especially considering the dynamic soil response under large stresses and strains, are described. For that, a combined experimental and numerical approach is chosen, including characterization of the soil by dynamic triaxial experiments realizing stress levels of about 1 MPa, acting in 1 ms on the specimen. The analysis showed that the measured triaxial strength of the soil differed from the static by a factor of 2 for the friction angle. Furthermore, scaled experiments have been designed and conducted to demonstrate and investigate the behavior of a buried tunnel segment under blast loading. The results showed that realistic <b>loading</b> <b>charges</b> can cause massive cracking of the tunnel system and a soil sinking of up to 1 cm. Both experimental results obtained from the triaxial tests on the one hand and from the scaled tunnel experiments on the other hand have been validated using numerical models. The good agreement obtained is the essential input parameter for the evaluation of criticality in tunnels under blast loading scenarios...|$|E

For sample A, the assessment was unique,while for sample B there was a preoperative assessment. This way, we will analyse the loading and soliciting degree atthe level of preoperative hip joints, with a subsequent identical postoperative analysis for the study sample. In this sense, we have used the GPS 400 stabilometric platform that through the pressure sensors test both therepartition of the body weight on the lower limbs, analysing {{at the same time}} the oscillations that appear during theorthostatic position. The principle of the stabilometric method is to analyse the barycentre in orthostatic position.

30|$|Transportation {{electrification}} {{has been}} {{regarded as one of}} the most promising solutions for petroleum consumption reduction and environmental protection. In recent years, the government regards promoting the development of electric vehicles (EVs) and construction of charging facilities as national strategic initiatives. The construction of charging facilities needs to be adapted to the configuration of electricity and transportation [1]. It is necessary to pre-evaluate the potential charging demand of a charging station (CS) before planning and the simulation of the <b>charging</b> <b>load</b> of the CS is the basis for this work. Similar to power load forecasting approximation, the scenario, neural network and other methods [2, 3] have been introduced to study <b>charging</b> <b>load.</b> However, the <b>charging</b> <b>load</b> depends on the behavior of the EV itself, in which the charging events primarily occur in the CS, where the movement and space-time characteristics need to be fully considered in order to achieve an accurate calculation. Thus the <b>charging</b> <b>load</b> approximation or forecasting would be different from those for electricity.|$|R

Besides, to maximize social benefits, effective scheduling strategies guiding fast charging behaviors should be formulated rather than simply increasing infrastructure construction investments on the power grid. This paper first analyzes the charging users’ various responses to an elastic charging service fee, and introduces the index of charging balance degree to a target region by considering the influence of fast <b>charging</b> <b>loads</b> on the power grid. Then, a multi-objective optimization model of the fast charging service fee is constructed, whose service fee can be further optimized by employing a fuzzy programming method. Therefore, both users’ satisfaction degree and the equilibrium of <b>charging</b> <b>loads</b> can be maintained simultaneously by reasonably guiding electric vehicles (EVs) to different fast charging stations.

Specifically, it assesses PEVs <b>charging</b> <b>load</b> by <b>charging</b> method in accordance with PEVs penetration scenarios, its percentage of total load, and voltage range under load conditions. Concretely, we develop EMTDC modelling to perform a voltage distribution analysis when the PEVs charging system by their charging scenario was connected to the distribution system under the load condition. Furthermore we present evaluation algorithm to determine whether it is possible to adjust it such that it is in the allowed range by applying ULTC when the voltage change rate by PEVs charging scenario exceed its allowed range. Also, detailed analysis of the impact of PEVs on power distribution system was carried out by calculating existing electric power load and additional PEVs <b>charge</b> <b>load</b> by each scenario on new-town in Korea to estimate total load increases, and also by interpreting the subsequent voltage range for system circuits and demonstrating conditions for countermeasures.
