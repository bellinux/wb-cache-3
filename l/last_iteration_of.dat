30|$|A second {{optimization}} {{is introduced}} {{to reduce the}} number of similarity computations: pairs that were already compared during previous iterations are ignored. This is done by only comparing two vertices in a local join operations if at least one of them has been updated (this is indicated by a specific flag). Finally, KNN-Descent leverages the fact that little improvement is typically observed in the <b>last</b> <b>iterations</b> <b>of</b> the algorithm. KNN-Descent therefore implements an early termination mechanism and stops the algorithm when the number of KNN updates in neighborhoods falls bellow a given threshold.|$|R
30|$|At {{each new}} <b>iteration</b> <b>of</b> the column {{generation}} process, the master problem is solved to optimality using a CPLEX solver {{to guarantee the}} optimality of the solution obtained at the previous iteration [29]. A CPLEX solver is used to solve the pricing problem only if the heuristic approach based on k-shorted path is {{unable to find a}} new IMCC configuration (column) with a negative reduced cost. Accordingly, CPLEX is used only very infrequently to solve the pricing problem at the <b>last</b> <b>iterations</b> <b>of</b> the Column Generation process and to prove the optimality of the mapping solution. By so doing, we speed up the column generation approach and we guarantee the optimality of the LP(M) solution.|$|R

In order to complete the FFT/iFFT implementation, intermediate setup iterations (representing outer loops) must be injected into the pipelined flow <b>of</b> <b>iterations.</b> The straightforward way is to completely drain the <b>last</b> <b>iterations</b> <b>of</b> the inner loop, executing the setup code (constants reset, pointers updates …), and then resuming the pipelined execution; this turns to be time-consuming due to the time needed for the prolog/epilog parts.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) for solving extremely large sparse linear systems arising in three-dimensional finite element limit analysis of geotechnical stability problems is studied. With problem size increasing beyond few millions of variables, {{the use of}} direct solvers becomes prohibitive (both in storage and computational times) even on modern computers. This motivates the study on possible employment of iterative methods to solve systems of equations resulting from interior point method-based limit analysis formulations. In this paper, an adaptive preconditioning technique based on incomplete Cholesky (IC) preconditioner, {{as well as a}} novel implementation scheme for preconditioned conjugate gradient method, is proposed to effectively deal with highly ill-conditioned systems, such as those which occur at <b>last</b> <b>iterations</b> <b>of</b> IPM methods. Numerical tests on some ultra-large scale sample geotechnical problems, along with comparison with other potential solution methods, verify the robustness and efficiency of the proposed approach...|$|R

40|$|International audienceParameter {{estimation}} {{in complex}} models arising in real data applications {{is a topic}} which still attracts a lot of interest. In this article, we study a specific data and parameter augmentation method which gives {{us the opportunity to}} estimate more easily the parameters of the initial model. For this reason, the notion of Gaussian randomization of a model with respect to some of its parameters is introduced. The initial model can be regarded as a submodel of the resulting extended incomplete data model. Under the assumption that the initial model has a unique maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and that the likelihood function is continuous we prove that the extended model has a unique MLE with common values for the parameters of the MLE which correspond to the initial model. We also prove the reverse direction. Moreover, an appropriate stochastic version of an EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm is suggested to make parameter estimation feasible. In particular, we describe how the regularized particle filter of can be used in this frequentist-based approach to perform the Monte Carlo E-step at each <b>iteration</b> <b>of</b> the stochastic EM algorithm. This regularized version is particularly adapted to the framework of Gaussian randomization since the <b>last</b> <b>iterations</b> <b>of</b> the EM algorithm are characterized by low variance in the parameter distributions. A toy example with available analytic solutions, a synthetic example and a real data application with scarce observations to the LNAS (Log-Normal Allocation and Senescence) model of sugar beet growth are presented to highlight some theoretical and practical aspects of the proposed methodology...|$|R

40|$|The {{computation}} time of Document Image Decoding can be significantly reduced by employing heuristics {{in the search}} for the best decoding of a text line. By using a cheap upper bound on template match scores, up to 99. 9 % of the potential template matches can be avoided. In the Iterated Complete Path method, template matches are performed only along the best path found by dynamic programming on each iteration. When the best path stabilizes, the decoding is optimal and no more template matches need be performed. Computation can be further reduced in this scheme by exploiting the incremental nature <b>of</b> the Viterbi <b>iterations.</b> Because only a few trellis edge weights have changed since the <b>last</b> <b>iteration,</b> most <b>of</b> the backpointers {{do not need to be}} updated. We describe how to quickly identify these backpointers, without forfeiting optimality of the path. Together these improvements provide a 30 x speedup over previous implementations of Document Image Decoding. Paper 4307 - 28 to be [...] ...|$|R
