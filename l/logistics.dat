5|$|Historians {{contend that}} for the UN and North Korea, locked in a bitter battle where neither could gain the upper hand, <b>logistics</b> {{was among the most}} {{important}} determining factors in how the war would progress. As the disparity in <b>logistics</b> capability widened between the UN and North Korean forces, the well-supported UN troops were able to hold their positions along the Pusan Perimeter, while the morale and the fighting quality of NKPA deteriorated as resupplies became increasingly unreliable. This trend ultimately culminated in the UN recapturing Seoul, the key <b>logistics</b> center of the battle, and the collapse of the North Korean <b>logistics</b> system with the entire NKPA.|$|E

5|$|In January 2007, {{the lineage}} and honors were {{designated}} {{to be transferred}} to the 16th Sustainment Brigade. On 16 July 2007 the group was reorganized {{as part of an effort}} to reform support groups into larger, more versatile sustainment brigades. It became the 16th Sustainment Brigade and was subsequently activated at Warner Barracks in Bamberg, Germany. The 16th Corps Support Group and the 7th Corps Support Group had been deactivated and combined to form the new formation. Their subordinate units had been moved and redesignated as well. This move made the 16th Sustainment Brigade the only brigade-sized <b>logistics</b> unit supporting United States Army Europe. It was put under the command of the 21st Theater Sustainment Command. The move was part of an overall streamlining of the Command's <b>logistics</b> element, as all major <b>logistics</b> formations were redesigned to be modular and more efficient. The sustainment brigade not only retained all previous <b>logistics</b> functions and responsibilities, but also assumed additional services, like finance, medical and signal capabilities. The brigade was composed of the 16th Special Troops Battalion headquartered at Bamberg, the 391st Combat Sustainment Support Battalion at Bamberg, and the 18th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion in Grafenwoehr. It also received its shoulder sleeve insignia.|$|E
