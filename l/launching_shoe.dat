40|$|Incremental {{launching}} of steel bridges is a demanding undertaking, on the erection site {{as well as}} on the designers desk. Not seldom, the structure itself is during the launching subjected to high concentrated forces on the lower flange when passing over the <b>launching</b> <b>shoe</b> or a intermediate support (e. g. column). These concentrated forces, commonly referred to as patch loads, may be of such magnitude that it governs the thickness of the web in the bridge girder and a small increase in web thickness leads to a substantial gain of steel weight of the bridge. Hence also a higher material cost. One solution to this problem is to reduce the buckling length of the web with the use of a longitudinal stiffener of open (a plate) or closed type (closed profile of e. g. V-shape). The improved patch load resistance is in the Eurocode nowadays determined with the help of the yield resistance for the web and contributing parts of the loaded flange reduced with a factor dependent of the slenderness of the web and the influence of the longitudinal stiffener. Parts in the expressions for the yield resistance and the reduction factor have been somewhat questioned and over the years a substantial amount of tests and FE simulations of longitudinally stiffened webs has been carried out. This research work has produced a large amount of test data which has been used herein to further improve the prediction of the patch load resistance of longitudinally stiffened steel girder webs. Based on the use of the gathered test data from the literature and previously done research, a calibrated patch load resistance function was developed for both open and closed longitudinal stiffeners. Furthermore, a partial safety factor for the proposal was determined according to the guidelines in the Eurocode. In all, the proposal was proven to have an improved level of prediction than other comparable proposals (e. g. Eurocode). Another questioned part in the commonly used design codes is the reduction function concerning local buckling under uniformly in-plane compression. The nowadays used function (the Winter function) has been developed during the 30 -ies based on tests on cold formed specimens and has been criticized as being too optimistic regarding plates with large welds. At LTU a series of tests on welded specimens made of high strength steel with large welds was conducted to investigate the aforementioned concerns. Along with test data found in a literature survey, the tests showed that the Winter function was shown to be too optimistic and a new reduction function, based on the test data, was proposed also for this application.

40|$|Incremental {{launching}} is {{a construction}} method in which bridge girders are first {{assembled in the}} vicinity of the future permanent position of the bridge. When the elements have been welded together the girders are launched to their permanent position. During the launching they often slide on <b>launching</b> <b>shoes</b> placed in the positions of the future permanent support bearings. At the launching stage relatively large support reactions are introduced into the steel girders as they ride on the <b>launching</b> <b>shoes.</b> These forces are quite concentrated (patch loading) and travel along the length of the girders as these are launched to their permanent positions. It is not uncommon that girders receive residual plastic deformation during the launching stage. Until now the design for patch loading has been made using methods that focus on the ultimate limit state, i. e. on the load-carrying capacity of the girder. This thesis presents a design method that focuses on avoiding plastic deformations in girder webs subjected to a travelling patch load. The method is based on a description of the elastic deformation that occurs in a girder web subjected to patch loading. The description was found by finite element simulations of laboratory tests on girders. It is concluded that no yielding should be allowed in the web plate since it may accumulate into residual deformations that could be potentially harmful for a travelling patch load. The design criterion was used in a parametric study where acceptable load levels were calculated by means of the finite element method. Regression analysis was then used to find a closed form solution that is easy to use for any structural engineer. The method deals with doubly symmetric I-shaped steel girders subjected to patch loading and bending moment...|$|R

40|$|Incremental {{launching}} {{is one of}} {{the common}} steel bridge assembly methods used nowadays, its practical application consists in passing the bridge assembly through the <b>launching</b> <b>shoes</b> as well as over each support pile. In some cases, when plate girders are used, it is usual to find longitudinal stiffeners reinforcement in order to prevent web local buckling produced by the vertical reaction acting in the support pile. A considerable number of studies have focused on evaluating the impact of a single stiffener on the resistance of plate girder subjected to patch loading. However, the effect of multiple longitudinal stiffened plate girders subjected to lengthy compressive load has received little attention. Therefore, this paper aims at studying the influence of load bearing length on the ultimate strength of multiple longitudinally stiffened webs subjected to compressive loads. Patch loading resistance is numerically calculated using a previously validated nonlinear finite element analysis. Subsequently, a parametrical study is conducted to investigate the effect of the aforementioned load length and the relative position and size of the stiffeners on the ultimate strengthPeer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R
