500|$|Higginbotham entered Purdue as a {{freshman}} in 1944. At the time, the student body was composed of approximately 6,000 white students, and 12 black students. Although eligible for admission, black students were not permitted {{to live in the}} dormitories. Higginbotham and the other 11 black students were placed in a building called International House, which was the only building that blacks could live in West Lafayette. The students slept in the attic, which was unheated. Higginbotham sought a meeting with the University President, Edward C. Elliott, to ask permission for the students to sleep in a section of one of the heated dormitories. Elliott's response was purportedly [...] "he law doesn't require us to put you in those dormitories. The law doesn't even require us to <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>in.</b> You take it or leave it." [...] Higginbotham would later identify this encounter, and an incident where he was traveling with the Purdue debate team, but unable to stay in a hotel {{with the rest of the}} members, as the events that caused him to pursue a career in the law, saying: ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} shows Rihanna sexually seducing her love interest, while {{revealing}} her [...] "nasty secrets". According to Julianne Shepherd of Spin, Rihanna [...] "coyly dares" [...] 'her lover to [...] "sex her up"'. In [...] "Roc Me Out", Rihanna uses her [...] "militaristic alternate persona" [...] and interprets the lyrics [...] "with a command and directness befitting" [...] of it. Rihanna complains to her lover throughout the lines [...] "You’re taking {{too long to}} get {{my head on the}} ground / And my feet in the clouds," [...] before cooing, [...] "I’ve been a bad girl, daddy". She gives him instructions while singing [...] "Get my head on the ground and my feet in the clouds". Priya Elan of NME commented that the song sounds like a [...] "‘Rude Boy’ re-tool from the vocal delivery to her 'Come on boy' line." [...] In the end, Rihanna reveals the [...] "dirtiest secret" [...] through the line [...] "I’ll <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> on a dirty secret, I just want to be loved". David Amidon of PopMatters described the line as the song's [...] "not exactly a dangerous sentiment".|$|E
500|$|Kahn {{said that}} the entire idea for the video was Brown's: [...] "It's an {{interesting}} video for me, because it's so rare that music videos ever try to achieve anything emotional. Chris just basically {{told me a story}} of what he felt this video was going to be, with his heart glowing and how he's, like, cold. It is a very personal story. But it's told in such a graphic manner that I {{fell in love with the}} idea. It's Chris' story. Period. I am the pencil that put it down on the paper." [...] When comparing the song's video to that of [...] "I Can Transform Ya", the director said, [...] "'Crawl' is my favorite one, because — gosh, I'm going to <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> on this — 'cause it's probably his most personal thing he's ever done." [...] He went on to say, [...] "I mean, everything that's happened to him in the year, I think this is going to be his big statement, in terms of what he's feeling and what he's living through right now." [...] When talking about the ideas and concepts of the video, Kahn {{said that the}} video, his first ballad with Brown, should speak for itself through the ideas that he had and the [...] "genesis" [...] of what that idea was.|$|E

2500|$|Between his smelter job and his music, {{he made a}} {{good living}} in the Helena area. He moved {{his wife and son}} to join him and they lived in Helena until 1967, {{purchasing}} their first home there, and with their children Dion and Angela being born at the local hospital. [...] The Pride family moved to Great Falls, Montana, in 1967, because Pride's music career was taking off and he required quicker access to an airport. The family ultimately left Montana and moved to Texas in 1969. [...] In a 1967 interview with the Helena Independent Record, Rozene commented that the family encountered minor racism in Montana, citing an incident where they were refused service in a restaurant and another time when a realtor refused to show them a home, but she felt that the family endured less racism than she saw leveled against local Native American people, whose treatment she compared to that given to black people in the South. Pride has generally spoken with fondness of the near-decade he spent there. “Montana is a very conservative state...I stood out like a neon. But once they <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>in,</b> you become a Montanan. When the rumor was that I was leaving. They kept saying, ‘we will <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>in,</b> you can’t leave.’" ...|$|E

[...] "Sorry," [...] said the maid, [...] "I can't <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> just now because Rabbeinu HaKadosh is in the middle of Kiddush."

It really plays on me being from Massachusetts, me living in L.A. and finding myself in between those two worlds, not feeling like I necessarily belong anywhere, but I guess that's how most people feel in their 20s anyway." ...|$|E

By the time Harry attends Hogwarts, Hagrid is also the Keeper of Keys and Grounds: the former, according to Rowling, means [...] "that he will <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> and out of Hogwarts."

"I {{sat down}} and wept when I remembered the lost pubs of Burslem, the {{demolished}} Star that stood where the Moonglow Ballroom stands now, {{on the corner of}} the street of the Preacher and the Tote office; it was a gaunt, dark building nicknamed the Star of Bethlehem, a grimey stuccoed star the colour of years of wet smoke. From outside it looked forbidding and empty, lit only by one or two naked electric light bulbs; its doors were difficult to find, its main door {{on the corner of the}} Square had been screwed down for some reason and on the inside covered with a piece of painted plywood. Only the side-doors would <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> and these were narrow and difficult to open.

Allen co-wrote every song on the record and worked on over 70 songs with multiple producers before narrowing it down the ten tracks {{that make up the}} album' final track listing. Inspired in part by his traumatic 2013 car crash (as was 2014's Horizons), the record has been described by Allen as his [...] "most personal" [...] yet.
