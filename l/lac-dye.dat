Red dyes such as madder, cochineal-kermès, and <b>lac-dye,</b> were quickly put aside, since their spectral profiles were too {{different from the}} measurements made on the manuscript. Our {{results showed that the}} purple color in lat. 11937 ’s decorations is similar to purple parchment in lat. 9380. These colours, also called folium, were most likely obtained from Chrozophora tinctoria a tinctorial plant in the Euphorbiaceae genus, growing in the Mediterranean region referred to the Bernard Guineau’s work [25] and to the results of analysis made by Flieder [33],—it referred also to those undertaken by a team of the Research laboratory on Historic monuments, LRMH Champ-sur-Marne working with the department for the restoration of the BnF, which concluded that colouring agents derivatives of orcinol that we can find either in orchils or in Chrozophora tinctoria L. were present [24, 34]; and it referred to the work of Fuchs and Oltrogge [21]—. This dye was used several times decorating the Fleury manuscripts in the 10 th and 11 th centuries (Orléans BM. 127 and 145), and it was identified in older manuscripts as well using the same method, as indicated in Guineau’s studies (BNF lat. 7520, lat. 2421; Amiens BM. 11, 18, 223; Vatican reg.lat. 124). In his papers, Guineau indicates that the word “folium” was often used in technical treaties as early as the 9 th century, including in the Mappae Clavicula, to describe a purple colour, although folium can also produce shades of pink that can go towards red or blue. We also observed these variations on the manuscripts we studied. A treatise preserved in London indicates the origins of folium: this helped Merrifield and other authors to identify Chrozophora tinctoria. Its use declines later in the Middle Age [35]. It seems to disappear from recipes of colour treatrises from the 14 th century {{for the benefit of the}} easier to find colouring agents: madder, kermès, brésil.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{mordanting}} method, dyeing temperature and time, {{as well as}} the type of mordants used in <b>lac-dyeing</b> process on the properties of silk yarn were studied. Three different mordanting methods, including pre-mordanting, simultaneous mordanting, and post-mordanting, were employed and the amount of adsorbed dye, the quality, and the breaking strength values of silk yarn were compared. Various natural products and chemicals were also used as mordants and they provided finished silk products of different color quality and breaking strength...|$|R
