This diploma thesis deals with selection {{the most important factors}} of the <b>living</b> <b>standard</b> {{of households}} in the Czech Republic, i. e. the selection of such factors of the <b>living</b> <b>standard</b> that have the greatest impact on Czech households. The <b>living</b> <b>standard</b> can be seen from two points of view. First, the <b>living</b> <b>standard</b> in the Czech Republic {{can be seen from the}} objective point of view [...] we focus on evolution of GDP per capita, household's income and expenditures, unemployment, household's debt and poverty rates. Second, the <b>living</b> <b>standard</b> can be seen from the subjective point of view based on data provided by The Public Opinion Research Centre. In this case, we monitor changes in opinions of Czech citizens regarding the <b>living</b> <b>standard</b> and economic situation in the Czech Republic. Subjective opinions of Czech households are also used in the next part of this diploma thesis, especially in the questionnaire survey. Thanks to these data, using the Prin-cipal Component Analysis, the most important factors of the <b>living</b> <b>standard</b> of {{households in the}} Czech Republic can be identified...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{considers}} the {{redistribution of income}} in a population of households which may differ by type. The redistribution is based on (differences in) <b>living</b> <b>standard</b> and a principle of between-type-progressive transfers (BTPT). We characterize {{the relationship between a}} social welfare ordering satisfying the BTPT principle and the concept of <b>living</b> <b>standard</b> the principle is based on. It turns out that there is a close link: The ordering of <b>living</b> <b>standard</b> can be derived from the social welfare ordering. Conversely, the class of welfare orderings fulfilling the BTPT principle for a given concept of <b>living</b> <b>standard</b> can be completely described.

5|$|Also, whilst {{productivity}} {{figures have}} improved, median incomes and stock market prices, {{and thus the}} returns to capital and labor, have not improved. Furthermore, government consumption (government activity excluding transfer payments) represents between 15–20% of GDP, but since the sector is measured at cost it becomes less and less productive as it grows larger. Thus, the more government consumption there is, the more published GDP figures tend to overestimate growth in <b>living</b> <b>standards.</b>|$|E

The common dynamic of income and subsistence minimum is analyzed, and conclusions about the built tendencies in the <b>living</b> <b>standard</b> of the Russian population in 2000 - 2014 are made. The analysis of the territorial and social-demographic poverty profiles in Russia and Germany are performed, communities that have the highest poverty risk in both countries are defined.

5|$|Under the {{influence}} of the collapsing of the Eastern Bloc, on 10 November 1989 the Communist Party gave up its political monopoly, Zhivkov resigned, and Bulgaria embarked on a transition to a parliamentary democracy. The first free elections in June 1990 were won by the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP, the freshly renamed Communist Party). A new constitution that provided for a relatively weak elected president and for a prime minister accountable to the legislature was adopted in July 1991. The new system initially failed to improve <b>living</b> <b>standards</b> or create economic growth—the average quality of life and economic performance remained lower than under communism well into the early 2000s. A 1997 reform package restored economic growth, but <b>living</b> <b>standards</b> continued to suffer. After 2001 economic, political and geopolitical conditions improved greatly, and Bulgaria achieved high Human Development status. It became a member of NATO in 2004 and participated in the War in Afghanistan. After several years of reforms it joined the European Union in 2007 despite continued concerns about government corruption.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{extractive}} {{industries have}} contributed strongly to New Zealand's economy, focussing {{at different times}} on sealing, whaling, flax, gold, kauri gum, and native timber. With the development of refrigerated shipping in the 1880s meat and dairy products were exported to Britain, a trade which {{provided the basis for}} strong economic growth in New Zealand. High demand for agricultural products from the United Kingdom and the United States helped New Zealanders achieve higher <b>living</b> <b>standards</b> than both Australia and Western Europe in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1973, New Zealand's export market was reduced when the United Kingdom joined the European Community and other compounding factors, such as the 1973 oil and 1979 energy crisis, led to a severe economic depression. <b>Living</b> <b>standards</b> in New Zealand fell behind those of Australia and Western Europe, and by 1982 New Zealand had the lowest per-capita income of all the developed nations surveyed by the World Bank. In the mid-1980s New Zealand deregulated its agricultural sector by phasing out subsidies over a three-year period. Since 1984, successive governments engaged in major macroeconomic restructuring (known first as Rogernomics and then Ruthanasia), rapidly transforming New Zealand from a protected and highly regulated economy to a liberalised free trade economy.|$|E

5|$|This period saw a {{political}} alignment with the Eastern Bloc countries and a shift toward economic insularity.

5|$|Five of the state's {{counties}} are wholly {{within the boundaries}} of sovereign Indian reservations. Because of the limitations of climate and land, and isolation from urban areas with more employment opportunities, <b>living</b> <b>standards</b> on many South Dakota reservations are often far below the national average; Ziebach County ranked as the poorest county in the nation in 2009. The unemployment rate in Fort Thompson, on the Crow Creek Reservation, is 70%, and 21% of households lack plumbing or basic kitchen appliances. A 1995 study by the U.S. Census Bureau found 58% of homes on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation did not have a telephone. The reservations' isolation also inhibits their ability to generate revenue from gaming casinos, an avenue that has proved profitable for many tribes closer to urban centers.|$|E

While unrest and desire for reform and change among both intellectuals and workers was beginning to surface throughout the Eastern Bloc, the death of Stalin's ally Bierut in March 1956 in Moscow (the veteran hardliner chief was attending the Soviet party's congress) exacerbated an existing split in the Polish party. In March Bierut was succeeded by Edward Ochab as first secretary. As the 20th Congress launched also a process of partial democratisation of Polish political and economic life, Ochab engaged in reforms intended to promote industrial decentralization and improve <b>living</b> <b>standards.</b>|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the 1990s, Zimbabwe's economy {{steadily}} deteriorated. By 2000, <b>living</b> <b>standards</b> had declined from 1980; life expectancy was reduced, average wages were lower, and unemployment had trebled. By 1998, unemployment was almost at 50%. As of 2009, three to four million Zimbabweans—the greater part of the nation's skilled workforce—had left the country. In 1997 there were growing demands for pensions from those who had fought for the guerrilla armies in the revolutionary war, and in August 1997 Mugabe put together a pension package that would cost the county ZD 4.2 billion. To finance this pension scheme, Mugabe's government proposed new taxes, but a general strike was called in protest in December 1997; amid protest from ZANU-PF itself, Mugabe's government abandoned the taxes. In January 1998, riots about lack of access to food broke out in Harare; the army was deployed to restore order, with at least ten killed and hundreds injured.|$|E
