5|$|Critics praised System Shock and hailed it {{as a major}} {{breakthrough}} in its genre. It was later placed on multiple hall of fame lists. The game was a moderate commercial success, with sales exceeding 170,000 copies, but <b>Looking</b> <b>Glass</b> ultimately lost money on the project. A sequel, System Shock 2, was released by <b>Looking</b> <b>Glass</b> Studios and offshoot developer Irrational Games in 1999. The 2000 game Deus Ex (also produced by Spector) and the 2007 game BioShock are spiritual successors to the two games. A remade version of the original game by Night Dive Studios is scheduled for release in 2018.|$|E

Blackley refused and was fired, leaving the company in late 1995. Constantine Hantzopoulos became the lead designer and project leader of the fourteen-member Flight Unlimited II team. The team eschewed the aerobatics focus of their previous game in favor of general civilian aviation, in order {{to compete with the}} Microsoft Flight Simulator series. <b>Looking</b> <b>Glass</b> announced the game on December 18, 1996. It was slated to include 6 planes, 45 airports and 8,500 square miles of terrain from the San Francisco Bay Area. The Bay Area was chosen because of its varied landscape and numerous airports.
