40|$|In {{celebration of}} MBoC’s first 20 years, {{members of the}} Editorial Board, members of the ASCB Council, and others comment on their {{favorite}} MBoC papers from the past two decades. This paper is a beautiful example of how studies in Drosophila melanogaster can reveal unexpected functions of conserved proteins in multicellular organisms. Drosophila spermatogenesis takes place within a syncytial cytoplasm. At the end of spermatogenesis, individualiza-tion complexes (ICs) containing F-actin traverse {{the length of the}} spermatid cysts, reorganizing membranes and removing material not re-quired in mature sperm. Previous experiments had implicated myosin VI in cellularization of the syncytial embryo. However, since mutations in the gene encoding myosin VI were unavailable, its in vivo functions were poorly understood. Hicks et al. (1999) isolated partial loss-of-function mutations in myosin VI and demonstrated that the incorporation of myosin VI at the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of <b>ICs</b> is necessary to form the robust F-actin arrays required for proper IC movement and individualization. This laid the groundwork for subsequent studies (many i...|$|R
40|$|Silicon based {{integrated}} circuit technology has shown astonishing progress scaling to smaller geometries {{as the industry}} follows Moore's predictions. However, {{in recent years the}} cost associated with staying at the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of silicon <b>IC</b> technology has resulted in many companies being either unable, or unwilling, to afford the investment required. As a consequence some have decided to use foundry technology and/or diversify into new device types and associated novel application areas. All of these diverse Silicon+ technologies have one particular feature in common, namely they all use silicon as a platform for system integration with the added value being the innovation associated with post-processing and/or technology integration, which in many cases is realised on standard foundry technology. This paper examines many of the issues associated with integrating foundry and custom IC wafers with both new materials and technologies such as MEMS based sensors and actuators. In particular it examines the various options available for companies considering Silicon+ technology applications and presents examples of successful applications of this approach. Some of these are illustrated below...|$|R
40|$|We have {{identified}} partial {{loss of function}} mutations in class VI unconventional myosin, 95 F myosin, which results in male sterility. During spermatogenesis the germ line precursor cells undergo mitosis and meiosis to form a bundle of 64 spermatids. The spermatids remain interconnected by cytoplasmic bridges until individualization. The process of individualization involves {{the formation of a}} complex of cytoskeletal proteins and membrane, the individualization complex (IC), around the spermatid nuclei. This complex traverses the length of each spermatid resolving the shared membrane into a single membrane enclosing each spermatid. We have determined that 95 F myosin is a component of the IC whose function is essential for individualization. In wild-type testes, 95 F myosin localizes to the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of the <b>IC.</b> Two independent mutations in 95 F myosin reduce the amount of 95 F myosin in only a subset of tissues, including the testes. This reduction of 95 F myosin causes male sterility as a result of defects in spermatid individualization. Germ line transformation with the 95 F myosin heavy chain cDNA rescues the male sterility phenotype. IC movement is aberrant in these 95 F myosin mutants, indicating a critical role for 95 F myosin in IC movement. This report is the first identification of a component of the IC other than actin. We propose that 95 F myosin is a motor that participates in membrane reorganization during individualization...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{research}} the effects of <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> shapes {{on the strength of}} centrifugal compressor compeller, the shrouded impellers of a large centrifugal compressor were introduced for finite element analysis. In the present study, the geometric models of 3 shrouded impellers were established in Solidworks 2007, and then numerical simulations were carried out using ANSYS. Through visualization of the computational result of the impellers with a square <b>leading</b> <b>edge,</b> a semi-circular <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> and a elliptical <b>leading</b> <b>edge,</b> it was clarified by comparison that different <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> shapes had significant influences on the compressor strength. According to the charts of the Von Mises stress versus <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> shapes, it was indicated that approximately a 27 % drop and a 32 % drop in maximum Von Mises stress value occurred in the shrouded impellers of a semi-circular <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> and a elliptical <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> compared to a square <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> respectively. That is, the semi-circular <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> or elliptical <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> employed in a centrifugal compressor would dramatically improve structural strength.

40|$|A {{detailed}} study of various geometric & flow parameters that influence the film cooling effectiveness of gas turbine blade <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> region was carried out. The parameters studied include <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> shape, effect of gill holes, internal impingement, coolant to main stream density ratio & blowing ratio. Three <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> which include a cylindrical <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of radius R = 38. 1 mm, elliptical <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of major radius 1. 5 R & elliptical <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of major radius 2 R have been studied. All three <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> have cylindrical coolant holes at ? 25 ?, ? 0 ? & gill holes at alpha 0 ?, ? 30 ?. There are three rows of film cooling holes with 15 holes each at fixed pitch of 4 D 0 ? & ? 30 ? & two rows of gill holes at ? 60 ? when measured from inside surface.

Both aerodynamic and aerothermal characteristics are calculated for a waverider forebody in hypersonic flow.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the Texas A&M University 7 by 10 foot Low Speed Wind Tunnel to provide a direct comparison {{of the effect of}} several <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> devices on the aerodynamic performance of a highly swept wing configuration. Analysis of the data indicates that for the configuration with undeflected <b>leading</b> <b>edges,</b> vortex separation first occurs on the outboard wing panel for angles of attack of approximately 2, and wing apex vorticies become apparent for alpha or = 4 deg. However, the occurrence of the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> vortex flow may be postponed with <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> devices. Of the devices considered, the most promising were a simple <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> deflection of 30 deg and a <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> slat system.

40|$|The {{steady-state}} aerodynamic {{characteristics of}} a new family of blunted <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> immersed in a high-speed rarefied air flow are examined by using a Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) Method. A very {{detailed description of the}} flow properties has been presented separately at the vicinity of the nose and adjacent to the afterbody surface of the <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> by a numerical method that properly accounts for non-equilibrium effects that arise near the <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> and that are especially important at high Mach number. Comparisons based on geometry are made between these new blunt configurations and round <b>leading</b> <b>edge.</b> Some significant differences between these <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> are noted on the flowfield structure and on the aerodynamic surface quantities. It is found that the upstream effects have different influence on velocity, density, pressure and temperature along the stagnation streamline ahead of the <b>leading</b> <b>edges.</b> The analysis also shows that, despite the seeming advantages of the new blunt <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> shapes, round <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> still provides smaller stagnation point heating.

40|$|Based on {{the premise}} that sharp <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> are {{beneficial}} for launch, ascent and landing phases several concepts for sharp <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> of winged re-entry vehicles have been scrutinized. On the other side blunt <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> mitigate the heat loads during re-entry. Therefore, to comply with material temperature limits either sharp <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> have to be cooled or the curvature shape must be changed between ascent/landing and re-entry flight phases. Sharp <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> shapes are enabled by transpiration cooling, heat pipe or other heat load relieving concepts. Changing the wing profile, i. e. shape morphing is a research topic in aircraft development which progresses steadily.

40|$|AbstractAn {{approach}} for designing the compliant adaptive wing <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> with composite material is proposed {{based on the}} topology optimization. Firstly, an equivalent constitutive relationship of laminated glass fiber reinforced epoxy composite plates has been built based on the symmetric laminated plate theory. Then, an optimization objective function of compliant adaptive wing <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> was used to minimize the least square error (LSE) between deformed curve and desired aerodynamics shape. After that, the topology structures of wing <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of different glass fiber ply-orientations were obtained by using the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) model and sensitivity filtering technique. The desired aerodynamics shape of compliant adaptive wing <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> was obtained based on the proposed approach. The topology structures of wing <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> depend on the glass fiber ply-orientation. Finally, the corresponding morphing experiment of compliant wing <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> with composite materials was implemented, which verified the morphing capability of topology structure and illustrated the feasibility for designing compliant wing <b>leading</b> <b>edge.</b> The present paper lays the basis of ply-orientation optimization for compliant adaptive wing <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) field...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> propeller blade reconfiguration system using Shape Memory Allow (SMA) muscles is presented. This work describes the design and testing of a <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> flap, {{which is used to}} alter the local camber of a propeller blade. The <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> flap is deflected by SMA wires housed in the blade and maintained in a fixed position with a shaft locking and releasing mechanism. A locking and releasing mechanism is utilized so that constant actuation of the SMAs is not required to maintain <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> deflection. The profile at 70 % span of the propeller blade was used to create a two-dimensional blade for <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> flap design implementation and load testing. Deflection of up to five degrees was obtained with the final design of the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> flap and locking and releasing mechanism. The SMA muscles used to deflect the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> were actuated electronically through resistive heating and were controlled by a proportional/integral gain control algorithm with closed-loop feedback from a linear displacement sensor within the blade.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{spanwise}} <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> blowing, {{a means of}} controlling the position and strength of <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> vortices, is analyzed by numerical solutions of the three-dimensional Thin-Layer Navier Stokes equations. The <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> jet is simulated by defining a permeable boundary, corresponding to the jet slot, where suitable boundary conditions are implemented. Numerical results agree favorably with experimental measurements. It is found {{that the use of}} spanwise <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> blowing not only magnifies the size and strength of the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> vortices, but also moves the vortex cores outboard and upward. As a result, the increase in lift comes primarily from the greater nonlinear vortex lift. The presence of the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> jet stream displaces the flow outboard, thereby increasing the effective aspect ratio of the delta wing. However, blowing causes earlier vortex breakdown, thus decreasing the stall angle...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{data show}} that the {{phenomenon}} of a separation induced <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> vortex {{is influenced by the}} wing thickness and the shape of the <b>leading</b> <b>edge.</b> Both thickness and <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> shape (rounded rather than point) delay the formation of a vortex. Existing computer programs used to predict the effect of a <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> vortex do not include a procedure for determining whether or not a vortex actually exists.
