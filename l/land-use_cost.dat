When there is harvesting, it is demonstrated that increased profitability of the alternative land-use activities will result in less animals and habitat land in the long-term. It is also shown that the price effect of the harvesting works different compared to the traditional Clark-model of marine resources. Because most terrestrial species represent no harvesting profit and are not harvested, the non-harvesting case is also analysed. Also now will improved profitability in the competing activities of keeping animals {{be a threat to}} the wild species as it triggers land-use conversion. Moreover, in absence of harvesting profit, there are no potential counteracting forces due to the existence of harvesting profit.

40|$|Renewable fuel standards, {{low carbon}} fuel standards, and ethanol {{subsidies}} are popular policies to incentivize ethanol production and reduce emissions from transportation. Compared to carbon trading, these policies lead to large shifts in agricultural activity and unexpected social costs. We simulate the 2022 Federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) {{and find that}} energy crop production increases by 39 million acres. <b>Land-use</b> <b>costs</b> from erosion and habitat loss are between $ 277 and $ 693 million. A low carbon fuel standard (LCFS) and ethanol subsidies have similar effects while costs under an equivalent cap and trade (CAT) system are essentially zero. In addition, the alternatives to CAT magnify errors in assigning emissions rates to fuels and can over or under-incentivize innovation. These results highlight the potential negative effects of the RFS, LCFS and subsidies, effects that would be less severe under a CAT policy. University of California, Davis.

40|$|Fusion has the {{potential}} to provide essentially inexhaustible, non-CO 2 emitting energy with low <b>land-use</b> <b>costs</b> and low nuclear materials risks. With a sustained and strong international research program, fusion development scenarios suggest several TW of fusion power could be available within the present century. This presentation will describe the scientific and technical issues facing fusion researchers in realizing {{the potential}} of fusion, highlight the recent advances and progress in fusion experiments, and overview international plans for the demonstration of fusion energy technology. Fusion energy involves high-temperature ionized gas, called plasma, that is heated to more than 170 million degrees so that isotopes of hydrogen can combine to create helium and release nuclear energy. The 33 g of natural deuterium present in every ton of water yields an energy-equivalent of more than 400 tons of oil. The challenge facing fusion scientists is two-fold: (1) the hot plasma must be suspended long enough for fusion reactions to occur, and (2) the fusion confinement device must be configured to be reliable and economically attractive. The most successful approach to date uses strong magnetic fields to create a toroidal magnetic bottle that allows the ionized gas to circulate for many 10 ’s of km and to generate fusion energy at a power density that has already exceeded tha...|$|R

Consequently, site selection and design methods for uranium tailings have undergone considerable change and development in recent years. While South African tailings-management technology has contributed significantly to these developments, its public and regulatory review is not, as yet, as extensively developed as in most other major uranium-processing countries. This paper outlines the options {{that should be considered}} in selecting the site for, and the design of, the most economic and evironmentally acceptable impoundment of tailings. A site selection method is described that ensures the consideration of all reasonable siting alternatives within a given radius of the plant site. Methods of qualitative and semi-quantitative evaluation of the alternative sites are mentioned that permit the sites to be rated according to visual, <b>land-use,</b> pollution-risk, and <b>cost</b> criteria. Alternative impoundment designs that are reviewed include embankments and diversions, liners, covers, and stabilization methods.

40|$|In the {{regulated}} community {{there is often}} concern as to whether mass removal at a contaminated site actually reduces risk, or whether the small risk reductions achieved warrant the large costs incurred. Decision-makers have to select feasible solutions based on the required risk reduction, costs of the remediation and environmental impact. Thus, a correct risk evaluation has to assess exposure according the required time frame and {{the characteristics of the}} process. In order to assess more accurately the affects of time and space in risk assessment, a new framework for quantifying short/long-term risk reduction was developed. In particular the research study highlights the following two innovative aspects: 1. A new approach for risk assessment, related to long-term in-situ remediation activities, and according to the land use and future land planning. 2. An analysis and evaluation of the overall costs related to remediation activities and redesign of the land use. The paper reports a study case of a site contaminated by chlorinated solvents.

40|$|Many European {{municipalities}} develop {{energy supply}} concepts based on renewable energies to reduce energy related {{greenhouse gas emissions}} and stimulate regional and rural economies. Improvement of security of supply using regional energy sources is an additional motivation for renewable energy investments. An increasing number of municipalities in the rural environment seek to meet all their energy demands with biomass. This article provides a system analysis of "Bioenergy Villages", balancing costs and CO 2 reduction of a rural model village in Germany. The results show that a 100 % energy supply based on biomass potentials {{within the boundaries of}} the municipality is technically possible but not reasonable with respect to <b>land-use</b> competition and <b>costs</b> of energy supply. The production of transport fuels based on energy crops (rape seed) leads to significant increase of costs and is dependent on a considerable raw material import from outside the municipality. Heat and power demand can be covered with biomass without a noTable increase in competition to other land use patterns and to relatively low costs. Thus utilization of biomass for heat and power production leads to a cost efficient CO 2 reduction whereas the transportation fuel production comes along with relatively high reduction costs and depletion of regional biomass and land area potentials. bioenergy village, rural supply concepts, rural energy planning, system analysis, life cycle assessment...|$|R
50|$|MAgPIE takes four {{different}} cost types into account: production costs for crop and livestock production, investments in technological change, land conversion costs and intra-regional transport costs. By minimizing these four cost components {{on a global}} scale for the current time step, the model solution is obtained. Production costs in MAgPIE imply costs for labor, capital and intermediate inputs. They are specific for all crop and livestock types and are implemented as costs per area for crops (US$/ha) and costs per production unit of livestock (US$/ton). MAgPIE has two options to increase total production in agriculture at additional costs: land expansion and intensification. In MAgPIE the latter can be achieved by investments in technological change (TC). Investing in technological change triggers yield increases which lead then to a higher total production. At the same time the corresponding increases in agricultural <b>land-use</b> intensity raises <b>costs</b> for further yield increases. The reason is that intensification on land which is already used intensively is more expensive than intensification on extensively-used land.To increase production another alternative is to expand cropland into non-agricultural land. The conversion causes additional costs for the preparation of new land and basic infrastructure investments, which are also taken into account. Intraregional transport costs arise for each commodity unit {{as a function of the}} distance to intraregional markets and therefore restrict land expansion in MAgPIE. This depends on the quality and accessibility of infrastructure. Intra-regional transport costs are higher for less accessible areas than for more accessible regions. This leads to higher overall costs of cropland expansion in those cases.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master thesis is to seek a greater {{understanding}} {{about the importance of}} a bus depot in urban development. It highlights the characteristics of an optimal bus depot where Oslo, Akershus, Hordaland, Stockholm and Trondheim are selected as the study case. The research study will describe the strategies of these regions to provide bus depot to their transport system. SWOT analysis and urban brief are used as analyzing tools to the research study. Environmental protection is one of the imperative tasks for the government. Through environmental awareness campaign, the government promotes the importance of emission decline by encouraging community to use actively public transport, cycling, or walking, rather than private cars. One of the success factors to make public transport works is that the infrastructure and facility for the operation is provided. Bus depot has important roles for a region that chooses bus mode in their transport system. Bus depot development attracts many attentions in the world of real estate development as it is a fixed infrastructure and facility that involves considerable land-use, long-term investment (site selection), resources and buildings. Furthermore, climate changes will pose new challenge when planning bus depot. However, this area is sometimes seen as not the most priority element in urban development plan with a long period perspective. Bus depot depends on bus volume. When there is growing needs in bus, there will be needs in increasing bus depot capacity. Failing to provide bus depot on time, will stop bus operation. For a region that has bus as the main public transport mode, this matter is crucial. Bus depot localization, building and design should be able to encounter demand such as the number of bus, type of bus (size, type of fuel, the choice of bus material and concept), bus route network and frequency, method for bus maintenance, limited land and local factors. When the demands are accommodated, the optimal condition is achieved. The characteristics of an optimal bus depot What is considered optimal to one stakeholder may not be optimal for other stakeholders. Furthermore, what theory has suggested on a bus depot location that somehow is ideal for accommodating particular routes, may be contrary to the regulation plan, neighbor, politics, local situations or the <b>land-use</b> <b>costs.</b> There are always approaches to balance the interests of particular stakeholders and the acceptable overall costs in order to implement an optimal situation. Findings from this master thesis have registered following characteristics of an optimal bus depot: 1. The bus depot carries acceptable overall costs for its public administration and public transport operator body, reaches the marked and brings social benefit for the community, with long time perspective. 2. It is optimal for the important stakeholders that are related to the depot. For the owner of public transport (e. g. a county) and its transport operator body, sufficient capacity and optimal location is the desirable situation. 3. It has good building and design with sufficient dimension and right facilities to accommodate people and buses activity continuously in short and long period. The strategies to provide an optimal bus depot The combination of practice in the cases in this master thesis shows that all regions expect strong growth and increased demand for bus as public transport, and optimizing in bus depot is an important instrument to support bus service. Strategies are made in order to provide the most acceptable situation. Through political process, Oslo, Akershus, Hordaland, Stockholm and Trondheim finalizes the localization, building and design for their bus depots. Following strategies are registered as efforts to supply optimal bus depot: 1. Bus depot as part of long-term urban development plan. Planning a bus depot has a time horizon about 10 - 25 years. A long-term urban development planning should include bus depot as the part of it. Area for the purpose of a bus depot must be regulated as early as possible. 2. Choose the solution that has the best time aspect. Some regions do not have 10 - 25 years on planning a bus depot. Therefore, the solution that is chosen must be realistic and has the best time aspect. 3. Involve stakeholders as early as possible. In order to reach an optimal situation, {{it is important that the}} planning have focus on consultation with the representatives of involving stakeholders as early as possible like public administration, employee, operator, neighbor and customer. 4. Choose the solution that has the most acceptable overall costs. Marked is an important aspect, However, localization, building and design should consider the comprehensive costs such as investment, land-use, operation and journey-to-depot with long time perspective, not only focusing to one element e. g. journey-to-depot costs. 5. The importance of a pleasant workplace. Bus depot is a work place. Job satisfaction through a good localization, building and design of a workplace is an important aspect. A pleasant workplace that provides convenience facilities for the employees creates proud and productive people. Good production relates to stability in bus operation. 6. Think fuel, think environment. An important prerequisite for providing an optimal bus depot is the choice of fuel comes as early as possible. Consideration must be given to fuel technology that gives the most promising in terms of climate, environment and cost. 7. Creative design. Creative design is applied in the planning. Following implementations of creative design are registered from the study case: - Smooth logistic. - Sustainable development consideration. - Multi land-use concept. - Environmental friendly solutions. - Creative design to encounter local conflicts...|$|R
40|$|Global biomass {{potentials}} are considerable but unequally distributed {{over the}} world. Countries with Kyoto targets could import biomass {{to substitute for}} fossil fuels or invest in bio-energy projects {{in the country of}} biomass origin and buy the credits (Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Joint Implementation (JI)). This study analyzes which of those options is optimal for transportation fuels and looks for the key variables that influence the result. In two case studies (Mozambique and Brazil), the two trading systems are compared for the amount of credits generated, <b>land-use</b> and associated <b>costs.</b> We found costs of 17 – 30 euro per ton of carbon for the Brazilian case and economic benefits of 11 to 60 euros per ton of carbon avoided in the Mozambique case. The impact of carbon changes related to direct land-use changes was found to be very significant (both positive and negative) and can currently only be included in emission credit trading, which can largely influence the results. In order to avoid indirect land-use changes (leakage) and consequent GHG emissions, it is crucial that bioenergy crop production is done in balance with improvements of management of agriculture and livestock management. Whatever trading option is economically most attractive depends mainly on the emission baseline in the exporting (emission credit trading) or importing (physical trading) country since both bio- and fossil fuel prices are world market prices in large scale trading systems where transportation costs are low. Physical trading could be preferential since besides theGHGreduction one could also benefit from the energy. It could also generate considerable income sources for exporting countries. This study could {{contribute to the development of}} a methodology to deal with bio fuels for transport, in Emission Trading (ET), CDM and the certification of traded bio fuels...|$|R
40|$|Microalgae are a {{promising}} feedstock for biodiesel production. To {{determine the future}} of biodiesel production from microalgae in the Netherlands the following question was asked: Which process to produce biodiesel from microalgae will be most suitable in the Netherlands, looking at stain selection, process technology and sustainability? This thesis focuses only on photoautotrophic microalgae grown in closed photo-bioreactors (PBRs) {{for the production of}} biodiesel in the Netherlands. Multi criteria analysis (MCA) was used to determine the most suitable species by using the criteria: lipid productivity, nutrient usage, climatic suitability, content of valuable co-products and harvesting ease. Also for the process design (cultivation method & harvesting technique) an MCA was used with the criteria: <b>land-use,</b> construction <b>costs,</b> operational costs and efficiency. It turned out that Nannochloropsis gaditana cultivated in a vertical column PBR and harvested through filtration is the best option, although for larger microalgae species centrifugation is preferred. The sustainability (minimizing environmental impacts and decreasing the depletion rate of fossil fuels) of the algae to biodiesel life-cycle was reviewed through a literature study focusing on: net energy rate (NER), greenhouse gas (GHG) balance, freshwater consumption, nutrient usage and co-product allocation. Microalgae cultivation inside a PBR, based on current PBR designs, is not sustainable due to elaborate PBR construction materials, PBR operation and high nutrient requirements. However, through process integration, biodiesel from microalgae can become a sustainable biofuel. Sea or wastewater should be used to provide nutrients while flue gas from power plants should provide CO 2. The residual biomass should be used to generate electricity through anaerobic digestion, afterwards all the nutrients, and water, should be recycled. In the Netherlands a PBR would require additional heating, which should preferably be derived as waste heat from other industries. All these process integrations require more research before successful application. Although the cultivation of microalgae has far higher productivities compared to other fuel crops, the cultivation (in PBRs) still requires large surface areas to give a substantial contribution to the Dutch policy goal of a 14 % share renewable energy in 2020. This is however even a larger problem with 1 st and 2 nd generation biofuels indicating that microalgal biodiesel has a larger potential to become the biofuel from the future. The costs of 1 l microalgal biodiesel grown in a PBR are currently too high. The Netherlands cannot become a large producer of microalgal biodiesel, mainly due to limitations in space. With higher productivities (l/ha/yr) some significant amounts for national consumption could possibly be commercial produced in a near future, although much research is needed especially within the field of genetic engineering and for the integration of sea/waste water and flue gas. The Netherlands could become a major consumer of microalgal biodiesel produced in other countries which have sufficient space and a better suitable climate. The Netherlands also do have the potential to become a source of knowledge for algae cultivation. To gain knowledge about algae cultivation the first PBRs should be focused on the production of valuable chemicals...|$|R
40|$|This thesis, which {{consists}} of five papers, addresses two themes related {{to the need for}} a scale-up of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction in the energy sector in developing countries: (1) approaches to support developing countries in scaling-up emissions reduction, and (2) an approach to scale-up emissions reduction [...] cultivation of fuel wood to replace fossil fuels in electricity generation. In the first paper, the potential volume of carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions reduction and reduction credits in the electricity sector under a sectoral crediting mechanism based on a sectoral no-lose, non-binding, target in the post- 2012 period is assessed for seven high-emitting developing countries by means of different scenarios. To do this assessment, an approach for setting national emissions intensity baselines and targets in the sector is developed. The assessment shows that a significant scale-up of emissions reduction could be achieved in the sector by boosting the efficiency of coal power plants and decreasing the share of coal-based electricity in new generation capacity in the seven countries. Given the set crediting targets, substantial volumes of annual credits could be generated. In the second paper, a hypothesis that carbon credits sale is not a decisive factor for the development of biomass power projects under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is tested by an empirical analysis using two objective indicators and by an econometric analysis. A decisive factor is also identified using the econometric analysis. The empirical analysis shows that there are indications that carbon credits sale is not a decisive factor {{for the development of a}} substantial share of registered CDM bagasse power projects in Brazil and India. The result from the econometric analysis supports the hypothesis. More important than crediting the emissions reduction is allowing access to the national electricity grid to sell electricity. This suggests that supporting developing countries in implementing policies and regulations which enable biomass power developers to sell electricity to the grid at an attractive price could greatly accelerate the development of biomass power projects. The third paper addresses a need for an approach to credit the national biofuel programs in developing countries for their benefit of reducing CO 2 emissions rather than crediting just CDM biofuel projects. In this paper, the impact of achieving the target of the national ethanol program in Thailand of replacing all conventional gasoline with gasoline containing ethanol at 10 % by volume (gasohol) by 2012 is assessed. The assessment shows that the program could lead to a significant increase in self-sufficiency of gasoline and a significant CO 2 emissions reduction. The program could also entail a land-use change (i. e., displacement of areas of food crops). The annual average cost of substituting gasohol for gasoline per ton of CO 2 emission reduction is estimated to be higher than the current carbon price. The fourth and fifth papers show that challenges for cultivation of fuel wood for electricity generation in Thailand involve <b>land-use</b> constraints and <b>costs,</b> respectively. In the fourth paper, the characteristics of farmers who commercially plant eucalyptus and the types of land where eucalyptus is planted are analyzed, based on a field survey carried out in Thailand. The factors that determine the farmers’ decision on whether to plant eucalyptus and the size of area to plant with it are identified, based on the survey using an econometric analysis. The analysis shows that farmers with a small farm do not and are not likely to plant eucalyptus wood. In addition, most eucalyptus growers plant eucalyptus on land used for food crops (mainly cassava area). In the fifth paper, the productivity of eucalyptus wood and the levelized cost of eucalyptus wood delivered to the factory gate in Thailand are estimated to be within the middle range of estimates in other developing countries. The cost of CO 2 abatement by substituting eucalyptus wood for coal and gas in electricity generation in Thailand is estimated to be much higher than the current carbon price...|$|R
