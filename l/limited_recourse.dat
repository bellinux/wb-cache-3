40|$|Trade {{openness}} {{can reduce}} inflation volatility through <b>limiting</b> <b>recourse</b> to seigniorage {{during periods of}} temporary fiscal deficits, and by shifting consumption and production towards goods for which the terms of trade are relatively stable. This paper provides evidence for a negative effect of openness on inflation volatility using a dynamic panel model that controls for the endogeneity of openness {{and the effects of}} both average inflation and the exchange rate regime. The relationship is found to be strongest amongst developing and emerging market economies. We show that openness reduces the volatility of reserve money growth and terms of trade growth and that these effects contribute to the relationship between openness and inflation volatility...|$|R

CGA should encompass {{all aspects of}} the patient’s health in a single process and allow for advanced care planning. This process has been shown elsewhere to reduce length of stay (LOS). Innovation: Previous research has been based within large clinical settings with many resources.

The project was carried out by a single Geriatric trainee and Nurse Practitioner whilst continu-ing with their usual clinical commitments, reflecting the <b>limited</b> <b>recourses</b> of many DGH’s.

40|$|AbstractManufacturing firms consume {{energy and}} natural {{resources}} in highly unsustainable manner and release large amounts of green house gases leading to many economic, environmental and social problems from climate change to local waste disposal. A growing number of organizations have begun working towards implementation of Green Manufacturing (GM) because of increased concerns about the pollution increase, natural resources depletion and global warming. However, there are barriers which hinder the implementation of GM. In order to mitigate these barriers, the prioritization of barriers is essential as high-priority barriers can be taken up first {{to address the issue}} more effectively within the available resources. The prioritization becomes more vital for the emerging countries because of the <b>limited</b> <b>recourses.</b> This paper aims at identifying and prioritizing barriers to GM implementation. A fuzzy TOPSIS multi-criteria decision model has been developed to prioritize these barriers from environmental, social and economic perspectives. The study concluded that lack of awareness/information, technological risk and weak legislation are three most important barriers to GM. The prioritization of the barriers from different perspectives is expected to help the decision/policy makers in government and industry to mitigate these barriers in an effective manner...|$|R

40|$|There are {{numerous}} construction safety measures {{adopted by the}} local construction industry in Hong Kong. The {{purpose of this study}} is to distil the more significant measures from all these practices. To achieve this, the rough set theory, a data mining technique by applying the rule induction method, is proposed to distil the rules that determine the safety performance of construction firms. Rough sets represent a different mathematical approach to vagueness and uncertainty. It is based on the assumption that lowering the degree of precision in the data makes the data pattern more visible. Under such an assumption, the rough set theory can provide the ability of classifying vague and uncertain data. A practical example is used to illustrate its application to distil these safety measures and highlight those which are most effective and important in combating site accidents. There are three decision rules identified; the best one is companies with a comprehensive safety orientation programme and good safety award campaigns for senior management staff which give the lowest accident rate and the best safety performance. Safety management rules can be successfully reduced, facilitating contractors to direct their <b>limited</b> <b>recourses</b> effectively. Rough set theory, site operations, health and safety,...|$|R
40|$|The {{empty chair}} crisis of 1965, {{resolved}} in the Luxembourg Compromise of 1966, forms part of the dramatic past of the European Union, and is for many a turning-point in European political integration. This volume, based on new research, revisits these events. It sheds fresh light on the mixed motives of the principal member states, European institutions and third-country actors, and identifies the shadows cast over subsequent legal and political practice. The book results from a collaborative project among historians, lawyers, and political scientists. It draws on new archival material and on many insights from practitioners, both some involved in the events of 1965 - 66 and others engaged in subsequent negotiations in the Council of the EU. Traces of these events persist in the consensus-oriented culture in the Council, where a concern to avoid sharply polarised confrontation <b>limits</b> <b>recourse</b> to active voting, even though the formal use of qualified majority voting has been greatly extended. Arguments over agricultural policy, the EU budget and world trade negotiations thus continue to provide occasions for some member states to insist on their `very important interests'.

40|$|Massive {{consumption}} {{of energy in}} drying industry makes it a matter of challenge regarding economical aspects and <b>limited</b> <b>recourses.</b> Several methods for drying including hot air convection, vacuum, infrared and hot air convection-infrared technologies were applied in order to estimate the consumed energy during the drying of mulberry fruit. Moreover, microwave heating, chemical (ethyl oleate and potassium), mechanical (ultrasonic) and blanching (hot water) pretreatments were compared. According to the Results, maximum energy consumption was recorded when no pretreatment was performed. Microwave heating in the hot air convection-infrared dryer resulted in the lowest {{consumption of}} energy. Total energy requirement decreased with {{the temperature in the}} convection dryer res. Conversely, energy increased with air velocity. The vacuum dryer consumed the highest amount of energy which was measured to be 46. 95 kWh while the lowest energy was recorded with using infrared-convective dryers. Also Experimental results showed that minimum and maximum specific energy consumption in the drying of black mulberry were associated with microwave pretreatment in IR-hot air dryer and control treatment in vacuum dryer, respectively. The minimum color change (ΔE) for drying of black mulberry was found in microwave pretreated samples dried with the vacuum dryer, yet maximum ΔE was observed in hot air dryer when no pretreatment was applied...|$|R

40|$|For many years, we {{have seen}} an {{increasing}} specialization of agricultural systems and territories, with a clear separation between territories with very high animal densities and those devoted to the growing of annual crops. This development is explained by market and sector economic logic and has been reinforced by the availability of low-cost inputs and animal housing systems based on direct grazing not requiring straw. It has, however, also involved negative environmental impacts and, in some cases, the impoverishment of soil fertility, a loss of biodiversity, and excesses of N and P, leading to eutrophication and hot spots of ammonia emission in livestock-breeding territories. Having recapped the mechanisms behind the specialization of systems and territories, we examined {{the extent to which}} the development of innovative mixed-farming systems that reconnect livestock and crop production on various territorial scales (farm, district, region) can reduce the negative impacts of agriculture on the environment, produce valuable ecosystem services and achieve acceptable economic efficiency for farming enterprises.
