40|$|AbstractHuman Topors, {{which was}} {{originally}} identified as cellular binding partner of DNA topoisomerase I and of p 53, {{has recently been}} shown to function as an ubiquitin E 3 ligase for p 53 in a manner dependent on its N′-terminally <b>located</b> <b>RING</b> finger. Here, we demonstrate that Topors also enhances the conjugation of the small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO- 1) to p 53 in vivo and in a reconstituted in vitro system. The Topors SUMO- 1 E 3 ligase activity does not depend upon its RING finger motif. In HeLa cells, Topors induced p 53 sumoylation was accompanied {{by an increase in}} endogenous p 53 protein levels. Furthermore, Topors enhances the sumoylation of a variety of other, yet unidentified, cellular proteins...|$|R

40|$|Models {{of closed}} and open channel pores of a muscle-type nicotinic {{acetylcholine}} receptor (nAChR) channel comprising M 1 and M 2 segments are presented. A model of the closed channel is proposed in which hydrophobic residues of the Equatorial Leucine ring screen the oxygen domain formed by the Serine ring, thereby preventing ion flux without completely occluding the pore. This model demonstrates a high similarity with the structure derived from a recent electron microscopy study. We propose that hydrophobic residues of the Equatorial Leucine ring are retracted when the pore is open. Our models provide a possible resolution of the nAChR gate controversy. We have also obtained explanations for the complex mechanisms underlying inhibition of nAChR by philanthotoxins (PhTXs). PhTX- 343, containing a spermine moiety with a charge of + 3, binds deep in the pore near the Serine ring where classical open channel blockers of nAChR bind. In contrast, PhTX-(12), which has a single charged amino group is unable to reach deeply <b>located</b> <b>rings</b> because of steric restrictions. Both philanthotoxins may bind to a hydrophobic site located close to the external entrance of the pore {{in a region that}} includes residues associated with the regulation of desensitization...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the distribution and localization of the neuropeptide arginine-phenylalanine-amide (RFamide) in the hypostomal and tentacular nerve net of the cnidarian polyp Hydra vulgaris. Immunohistochemical techniques were used to visualize three RFamide-positive distinct nerve ring structures, nerves and neurites throughout the ectoderm of the hypostome and tentacles of ablated hypostomes. Two RFamide-positive circumhypostomal nerve rings are reported here: an inner <b>ring</b> <b>located</b> near the mouth and an outer <b>ring</b> <b>located</b> beneath the tentacle attachment sites. Both rings are consistent with rings labeled with anti-α-tubulin; the outer ring is also coincident with a GABAB receptor-antibody-labeled ring previously described (Hufnagel and Kass-Simon, manuscript in preparation). A third, previously undescribed, set of nerve ring structures are reported, these are circumtentacular nerve <b>rings</b> <b>located</b> {{around the base of}} each tentacle. These circumtentacular rings were situated at the tentacle-hypostome junctions. Comparison preparations using anti-α- tubulin antibodies also showed circumtentacular ring structures. A continuous RFamide-labeled nerve net was seen throughout the hypostome and tentacles. RFamide labeled nerves were observed to be consistently associated with the nematocytes; this was especially apparent in the battery cell complexes within the tentacles. These results expand on the understanding of the role of RFamide in the chemical neurotransmission of hydra and suggest that RFamide leads to tentacular contractions during hydra feeding behaviors...|$|R

40|$|The {{elasticity}} of DNA catenanes, i. e. multiply linked DNA rings, is investigated using the Gauss invariant as a minimal model for topology conservation. An effective elastic free energy {{as a function}} of the distance R between segments <b>located</b> on different <b>rings</b> is obtained. An anharmonic part at large distances, growing as R^ 4, if R≫ R_G (R_G being the radius of gyration of a random walk ring) is found, while for R≪ R_G the interaction is strongly repulsive. Treating the attractive interaction as the dominant one, distribution functions for the distance between segments <b>located</b> on different <b>rings</b> for several linking numbers are derived which are in qualitative agreement with distributions functions obtained experimentally from electron micrographs of DNA catenanes (S.

30|$|Ringing {{may occur}} {{also as a}} result of an image {{restoration}} process, unlike the other artifacts which usually occur during compression. The ringing that occurs due to image restoration has different characteristics as compared to the one that occurs due to compression. Iterations of blind deconvolution in the image restoration process are likely to result in the generation of ringing[58]. A quality method to assess perceived ringing {{as a result of}} application of blind deconvolution methods for image restoration is proposed in[58] and in[59]. The authors claim that these methods evaluate ringing with no sensitivity to the image content type and any specific ringing process. In the method proposed in[58], a 2 D Gabor wavelet filter and a line detector were used to quantify ringing in restored images. A similar approach with enhancement is found in[59] where the authors have proposed to assess the degradation on image boundaries and image edges separately and then fuse the weighted results of the two values to have the overall ringing value. A 2 D Gabor filter response image is used to calculate the perceived ringing at boundaries, and a Canny edge detector is used for <b>locating</b> <b>ringing</b> around edges in the image. The proposed method was tested on gray scale images restored from simulated blur. It has been found that the reported results are in line with subjective scores of quality assessment.|$|R
