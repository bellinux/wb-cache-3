5000|$|Stands are emplaced on {{the floor}} of the {{drilling}} rig by the chain hand. When stands are being put onto the floor the chainhand is said to be [...] "racking stands". After the bottom of the stand is placed {{on the floor}}, the derrickman will unlatch the elevators and pull the stand in either with a rope or with just his arms. When stands are being put back into the hole, the derickman will slam the stand into the elevators to force them to <b>latch.</b> <b>The</b> chainhand will brace against the stand to control it when the driller picks it up.

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} retaining devices {{which are used}} to latch two elements or parts together and, more particularly, to gate latches for use in locking a gate to a wall bracket in a water pit utilized to store or handle hazardous materials. A retaining latch is provided comprising a latch plate which is rotatably mounted to {{each end of the}} top of the gate and a recessed opening, formed in the gate frame, for engaging an edge of <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> plate. <b>The</b> <b>latch</b> plate is circular in profile with one side cut away or flat, such that <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> plate is D-shaped. The remaining circular edge of <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> plate comprises steps of successively reduced thickness. The stepped edge of <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> plate fits inside a recessed opening formed in the gate frame. As <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> plate is rotated, alternate steps of <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> plate are engaged by the recessed opening. When <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> plate is rotated such that the flat portion of <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> plate faces <b>the</b> recessed opening in the gate frame, there is no connection between the opening and <b>the</b> <b>latch</b> plate and <b>the</b> gate is unlatched from the gate frame...|$|R

Their organizations formed without any clear political motives and soon found themselves involved in lucrative criminal activities, including extortion, gambling, people smuggling, and prostitution. Prostitution {{proved to be}} an extremely profitable business for <b>the</b> <b>tongs,</b> due to <b>the</b> high male-to-female ratio among the early immigrants. <b>The</b> <b>tongs</b> would kidnap or purchase females (including babies) from China and smuggle them over the Pacific Ocean to work in brothels and similar establishments.

50|$|The {{first person}} to produce a {{practical}} thermal method was Marcel Grateau in 1872. He devised a pair of specially manufactured tongs, in {{which one of the}} arms had a circular cross-section and the other a concave one, so that one fitted inside the other when <b>the</b> <b>tongs</b> were closed. <b>The</b> <b>tongs</b> were generally heated over a gas or alcohol flame and the correct temperature was achieved by testing <b>the</b> <b>tongs</b> on a newspaper; if the paper browned slightly it was about right. The waving itself was safe if care was taken to keep <b>the</b> <b>tongs</b> away from <b>the</b> scalp. The procedure was to comb a lock of hair towards the operator, moving the comb slowly with one hand to maintain some tension, while applying <b>the</b> <b>tongs</b> to <b>the</b> hair successively down the lock of hair towards the point. Each time <b>the</b> <b>tongs</b> were applied, they were moved slightly in a direction normal to the lock of hair, thus producing a continuous flat or two-dimensional wave. Skill using the wrist could produce slight variations of the wave. Thus, Marcel waving produced a two-dimensional wave, by thermal means only and the change was produced by plastic flow of the hair, rather than by any chemical means. Because of the high temperature used, the process tended to degrade the hair. However, in spite of its drawbacks, forms of Marcel waving have persisted until today, when speedy results and low cost are important.|$|R
