40|$|The aim of {{the present}} thesis was to study the heat flows in the blast furnace hearth lining by {{experimental}} measurements and numerical modeling. Thermocouple data from an operating furnace have been used throughout the work, to verify results and to develop methodologies to use the results in further studies. The hearth lining {{were divided into two}} zones based on the thermocouple readings: a region with regular temperature variations due to the tapping of the furnace, and another region with slow temperature variations. In an experimental study, the temperatures of the outer surfaces of the wall and bottom were measured and compared with <b>lining</b> <b>temperature</b> measured by thermocouples. Expressions to describe the outer surface temperature profiles were derived and used as input in a two-dimensional steady state heat transfer model. The {{aim of the}} study was to predict the <b>lining</b> <b>temperature</b> profiles in the region subjected to slow temperature variations. The methodology to calculate a steady state <b>lining</b> <b>temperature</b> profile was used as input to a three-dimensional model. The aim of the three-dimensional model was primarily to study the region with dynamic <b>lining</b> <b>temperature</b> variations caused by regular tappings. The study revealed that the replacement of original lining with tap clay has an effect when simulating the quasi-stationary temperature variations in the lining. The study initiated a more detailed study of the taphole region and the size and shape of the tap clay layer profile. It was concluded, that in order to make a more accurate heat transfer model of the blast furnace hearth, the presence of a skull build-up below the taphole, erosion above the taphole and the bath level variations must to be taken into consideration.

40|$|As {{the demand}} for energy increases, as well as {{the demand for}} {{renewable}} energy, Vattenfall, as network owner, receives many requests to connect new wind power to the grid. The limiting factor for how much wind power that can be connected to the grid is in this case the maximum current capacity of the overhead lines that is based on a <b>line</b> <b>temperature</b> limit. The temperature limit is set to ensure a safety distance between the lines and the ground. This master thesis project is a part of a research project at Vattenfall Research and Development that is examining the possibilities of increasing the allowed current on overhead lines {{in order to be able}} to connect more wind power to the existing network. Measured data from two overhead lines in southern Sweden is analyzed and the internal relations between the measured parameters are examined. The measured parameters are overhead <b>line</b> sag, <b>line</b> <b>temperature,</b> ambient temperature, solar radiation, wind speed and line current. The results indicate that there is a big load margin that could be utilized to increase the maximum current as long as further work could show that low winds at line height correlates with low wind at nacelle height. The results show that the sag versus <b>line</b> <b>temperature</b> is approximately linear within the measured temperature range. This means that a real-time-monitoring system measuring the <b>line</b> <b>temperature</b> should give adequate knowledge of the line position to ensure the safety distance. A model for the <b>line</b> <b>temperature</b> as a function of insolation, current, ambient temperature and wind speed has been estimated for one of the lines. Simulations show that a sudden increase in current at a worst-case scenario would give the operators about ten minutes to react before the <b>line</b> reaches the <b>temperature</b> limit...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn the {{water-bearing}} {{soft rock}} strata of West China, a field measurement {{is carried out}} on the shaft lining in bedrock section. The shaft lining is built with freezing method. From the measurement, some changes of regularity in construction, thawing and post thawing period are obtained, including the temperature, freezing pressure and the vertical and hoop strain of the shaft lining. Measurement studies have shown that: during the plastic stage of shaft construction period, {{with the release of}} hydration heat, the thermal expansion occurs in the concrete and the strain gauge, leading to tensile strain. In the earlier stage, the elastic modulus and strength of concrete increases rapidly. When the shaft <b>lining</b> <b>temperature</b> reaches its maximum, the cooling and growth in the freezing pressure make the hoop strain increase sharply. However, the hoop strain is at lower tensile or compressive value. In the early stage and mature stage, the strain change is mainly affected by temperature. In the thawing and post thawing period, the concrete strain is also primarily influenced by temperature change. During the measurement, when the maximum compressive strain is less than ultimate value, the shaft lining is in a safe state. To ensure the security of the shaft lining, the concrete strength growth and sidewall temperature should be controlled in the similar shaft condition. In addition, the reinforcement ratio should not be too small for the shaft lining in frozen bedrock. And further, the fiber reinforced concrete, shrinkage-compensating concrete and low hydration heat concrete technology can also be adopted to reduce the cracks as much as possible and to avoid penetrating cracks. For the soft aquifers in West China, the further field measurement is still needed to obtain the stress and deformation regularities of the shaft lining, which can not only provide a basis for security assessment of the shaft, but also guide its design and optimization to improve the design theory...|$|E
