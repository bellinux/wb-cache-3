5|$|In September 1990, Dugard and {{her family}} moved from the Los Angeles County city of Arcadia, to Meyers, a rural town south of South Lake Tahoe, California, because {{they thought it was}} a safer community. At the time of the abduction, Dugard was in the fifth grade and, because of her shyness, was {{worrying}} about an upcoming field trip. She was close to her mother, Terry Probyn, and her infant half sister Shayna who was born in 1990. Her biological father, Ken Slayton, did not know he had fathered a child. Although her mother married a man named Carl Probyn, Dugard was never close to her stepfather. On June 10, 1991, Dugard's mother, who worked as a typesetter at a print house, <b>left</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> early in the day. Eleven-year-old Dugard, wearing her favorite all-pink outfit, walked up the hill from her house, against traffic, to catch the school bus. When she was halfway up the hill, a car approached her. She thought that the man in the car would ask for directions. When he rolled down the window, he shocked her unconscious with a stun gun and abducted her. The man was Phillip Greg Garrido. Nancy, who the District Attorney in the Dugard case believes scouted Dugard as a prize for Garrido, held Dugard down in the car as she drifted {{in and out of consciousness}} during the three hour drive from her home to the Garrido home in Antioch. The only time Dugard spoke was when she pleaded that her parents could not afford a ransom.|$|E
25|$|During their engagement, Lazarus {{brought her}} skis to the {{apartment}} Ruetten shared with Rasmussen {{and asked him to}} wax them, and despite Rasmussen's objections, he complied. Rasmussen felt this was a little strange, since Lazarus was dressed in flattering workout clothes, and after Lazarus left asked her fiancé if their relationship was truly over. Ruetten convinced her the two were just friends. A few days later Lazarus returned, in uniform and armed, after he had <b>left</b> <b>for</b> <b>work,</b> to pick the waxed skis up.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 19, Connick became apprenticed in the {{production}} of stained glass windows at the shop of Rudy Brothers in Pittsburgh, where he stayed through 1899. He <b>left</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> in Boston for two years, returning to Pittsburgh in 1903 and worked for a number of stained-glass companies both in Pittsburgh and New York. Connick also studied drawing and painting in night classes and went to England and France to study ancient and modern stained glass, including those in the Chartres Cathedral, in which he examined the effect of light and optics that had been employed in the 12th and 13th centuries, but which he perceived to be neglected since. Connick was also influenced by English Arts and Crafts Movement stained glass artist Christopher Whall.|$|E

500|$|On January 7, 1973, Kemper, who had now {{moved back}} in with his mother, was driving around the Cabrillo College campus when he picked up 18-year-old student Cynthia Ann [...] "Cindy" [...] Schall. He drove to a sequestered wooded area and fatally shot her with a [...]22 caliber pistol. He then placed her body {{in the trunk of}} his car and drove to his mother's house, where he kept her body hidden in a closet in his room overnight. When his mother <b>left</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> the next morning, he had sex with, and removed the bullet from, Schall's corpse before dismembering and decapitating it in his mother's bathtub. He kept the severed head for several days, {{regularly}} engaging in irrumatio with it, before burying it in his mother's garden facing upward toward her bedroom – later remarking that his mother [...] "always wanted people to look up to her." [...] He then discarded the rest of her remains by throwing them off a cliff. Over the course of the following few weeks, all but her head and right hand were discovered and [...] "pieced together like a macabre jigsaw puzzle". Police and a pathologist determined she had been hacked to death then cut into pieces with a power saw.|$|E
500|$|Burke met {{two women}} in early April: Mary Paterson (also known as Mary Mitchell) and Janet Brown, in the Canongate area of Edinburgh. He bought the two women alcohol before {{inviting}} them back to his lodging for breakfast. The three left the tavern with two bottles of whisky and went instead to his brother's house. After his brother <b>left</b> <b>for</b> <b>work,</b> Burke and the women finished the whisky and Paterson fell asleep at the table; Burke and Brown continued talking but were interrupted by McDougal, who accused them of having an affair. A row broke out between Burke and McDougal—during which he threw a glass at her, cutting her over the eye—Brown stated {{that she did not}} know Burke was married and left; McDougal also left, and went to fetch Hare and his wife. They arrived shortly afterwards and the two men locked their wives out of the room, then murdered Paterson in her sleep. That afternoon the pair took the body to Knox in a tea-chest, while McDougal kept Paterson's skirt and petticoats; they were paid £8 for the corpse, which was still warm when they delivered it. Fergusson—one of Knox's assistants—asked where they had obtained the body, as he thought he recognised her. Burke explained that the girl had drunk herself to death, and they had purchased it [...] "from an old woman in the Canongate". Knox was delighted with the corpse, and stored it in whisky for three months before dissecting it. When Brown later searched for her friend, she was told that she had left for Glasgow with a travelling salesman.|$|E

2500|$|Growing up, Cho recounted {{that life}} was financially {{difficult}} as an undocumented immigrant, stating, [...] "My parents <b>left</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> before I woke up and came back home after I went to sleep. We had financial difficulties and {{there were times when}} we had no water or electricity for a few days because we weren't able to pay the bills. Other daily activities that others take for granted such as having a drivers’ license was difficult for my father". [...] Due to a display of skill in speed skating, his parents sold their business and spent their savings to move to Salt Lake City to train Cho for the sport after he graduated from junior high school. Simon Cho now resides in Rockville, Maryland and when he is not coaching, he enjoys watching sports, documentaries and attending concerts.|$|E
