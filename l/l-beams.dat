5000|$|The Monolith was {{fabricated}} by Louie Raffloer at Seattle’s Black Dog Forge. The monolith was {{a hollow}} structure measuring 1 ft × 4 ft × 9 ft. It was constructed of 16 gauge steel and <b>L-beams.</b> Rebar protruded {{from the bottom}} to attach the Monolith to its foundation. Estimates on the weight ranged from 350 lbs [...] to 500 lbs. The foundation consisted of 4 steel tubes connected by rebar. The foundation {{was buried in the}} ground and embedded in concrete.When the Monolith was erected, quick set epoxy was poured into the tubes and the rebar {{on the bottom of the}} Monolith was inserted into the tubes.|$|E
50|$|A {{thin walled}} beam {{is a very}} useful type of beam (structure). The cross section of thin walled beams is made up from thin panels {{connected}} among themselves to create closed or open cross sections of a beam (structure). Typical closed sections include round, square, and rectangular tubes. Open sections include I-beams, T-beams, <b>L-beams,</b> and so on. Thin walled beams exist because their bending stiffness per unit cross sectional area {{is much higher than}} that for solid cross sections such a rod or bar. In this way, stiff beams can be achieved with minimum weight. Thin walled beams are particularly useful when the material is a composite laminate. Pioneer work on composite laminate thin walled beams was done by Librescu.|$|E

A new hole insertion method is developed and implemented in the level set method. The method is applied to optimise two numerical problems: One is the well-known <b>L-beam</b> problem {{and the other is}} the Michell simply supported beam. The stress-based optimum solutions to these problems are studied...|$|R

Nevertheless its biochemistry is only partially understood, due to it a few tools such as X-ray absorption near edge structure may be used to determine its chemical speciation in biological system. In this paper we focused on analysis of composition and elemental distribution in tissue structures of biological samples. We examined cancerous and non-cancerous prostate tissues.

40|$|The large {{deflection}} flexural behaviour, particularly in plastic range, of beams of right-angle section under four-point symmetric bending is investigated thoroughly. Experiments {{were carried out}} for symmetric bending of aluminium alloy <b>L-beams</b> to observe the global load-deflection characteristics, {{as well as the}} distortion of cross-sections. The effect of supporting condition in the four-point bending on the global behaviour of the <b>L-beams</b> was also examined experimentally. By considering the geometrical change of beam and the plastic energy dissipations due to the global bending of beam and the angular distortion of cross-sections, a rigid, linear hardening model is proposed. The model is capable of predicting the cross-sectional distortion and the structural softening behaviour observed in the experiments with a reasonable accuracy. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{experimental}} and numerical investigations on the Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) failure analysis and structural behaviour of the CFRP flexural strengthened steel <b>l-beams.</b> Understanding the CFRP failure modes {{is useful to}} find solutions for preventing or retarding the failures. One non-strengthened control beam and twelve strengthened beams using different types and dimensions of CFRP strips in both experimental test and simulation modelling studies were investigated. In the experimental test, four-point bending method with static gradual loading was applied. To simulate the specimens, the ANSYS software in full three dimensional (3 D) modelling case and non-linear analysis method was utilized. The results show the CFRP failure modes used in flexural strengthening of steel <b>l-beams</b> include below point load splitting (BS), below point load debonding (BD), end delamination (EDL), and end debonding (ED). The occurrences and sequences of CFRP failure modes depended on the strengthening schedule. The structural performance of the CFRP strengthened steel beams also varied according to the strengthening specifications investigated in this research...|$|E

Specimens made of Al-alloy <b>L-beams</b> simulating stringer reinforcements of airplane structure were studied. The samples were repeatedly immersed in sea salt solution. The acoustic emission activity was recorded in situ during corrosion process. Nonlinear parameters of the samples were measured in between corrosion tests by NWMS method.

40|$|Abstract. Chassis {{strength}} and durability of local buses has been successively developed as many large automobiles due to reason for safe passenger transportation. This paper describes design method and strength analysis of chassis structure for double deck bus. C-beam and <b>L-beam</b> are created and assembled as for chassis frame structure by using CAD software. Finite element simulation is employed to evaluate total deformation {{and strength of}} designed bus chassis structure according to reliable safety factor from engineering design principle. Loading condition for simulation includes fully applied bending forces that are defined as heavy weight exerted on member joints. Finite element simulation result reveals that the fracture stress is not over than yield stress of the material. Safety factor is 2. 16, which is the acceptable value under defined safety standard from department of land transport...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} global (one constraint) {{version of the}} {{clustered}} approach previously developed for stress constraints, and also applied to fatigue constraints, in topology optimization. The global approach gives designs without large stress concentrations or geometric shapes that would cause stress singularities. For example, we solve the well known <b>L-beam</b> problem and obtain a radius at the internal corner. The main reason for using a global stress constraint in topology optimization {{is to reduce the}} computational cost that a high number of constraints impose. In this paper we compare the computational cost and the results obtained using a global stress constraint versus using a number of clustered stress constraints. We also present a method for deactivating those design variables that are not expected to change in the current iteration. The deactivation of design variables provides a considerable decrease of the computational cost and it is made {{in such a way that}} approximately the same final design is obtained as if all design variables are active...|$|R
40|$|An L-shaped {{curved beam}} {{specimen}} and a tension loading fixture were proposed {{to measure the}} interlaminar tension strength of laminated and textile composites. The specimen size was 2 X 2 in. (51 X 51 mm). The use of a standard tension test machine {{and the introduction of}} load nearly at the specimen midthickness were the advantages of the proposed specimen. Modified Lekhnitskii and beam theory equations for calculating interlaminar stresses of an <b>L-beam</b> were verified by finite element analysis. The beam theory equation is simple and accurate for mean radius to thickness ratios greater than 1. 5. The modified Lekhnitskii equations can be used for detailed stress field calculation. AS 4 / 3501 - 6 graphite/epoxy unidirectional specimens with thicknesses of 16, 24, and 32 piles were fabricated and tested. The delamination initiation site agreed with the calculated maximum interlaminar tension stress location for all three thicknesses. Average interlaminar tension strengths of 16 -, 24 -, and 32 -ply laminates were 47. 6, 40. 9, and 23. 4 MPa, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Cost {{reduction}} {{is one of}} the methods applied for improving the productivity of organizations. In productivity literature, particularly in nonparametric methods, cost reduction related methods are regarded as input oriented models. This paper presents a Supply Chain Management (SCM) model in which purchasing iron ore and coke from different resources, along with production and distribution of steel products were investigated to improve the productivity of a steel making plant in Iran. The model was designed based on a single objective concept with a focus on total cost minimization. The constraints of the model consisted principal restriction concerning mines, coke plant and products. The model was implemented in steel factories (blast furnace) affiliated with Iranian Mines and Mining Industries Development and Renovation Organization (IMIDRO). The results showed that the priority for providing iron ore should be given to Iran Central Iron Ore Company (ICIOC) which has enough production capacity to satisfy the required ores. The results further suggested that at the best productivity condition, Isfahan steel plant should focus on the beam and bar production. The other plants, i. e. Zagros plant, should focus on <b>L-beam</b> and slab and finally Meibod steel plant should concentrate on slab production. It was also showed that the coke production plants cannot supply the required tonnage of the steel plants. Therefore, some new plants should be established to achieve self-sufficiency in this industry. This model {{can be used as a}} support tool for decision-makers at strategic and tactical decision levels...|$|R
