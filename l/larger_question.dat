5|$|An inflationary phase, an {{additional}} phase of strongly accelerated expansion at cosmic times of around 10âˆ’33 seconds, was hypothesized in 1980 {{to account for}} several puzzling observations that were unexplained by classical cosmological models, such as the nearly perfect homogeneity of the cosmic background radiation. Recent measurements of the cosmic background radiation {{have resulted in the}} first evidence for this scenario. However, there is a bewildering variety of possible inflationary scenarios, which cannot be restricted by current observations. An even <b>larger</b> <b>question</b> is the physics of the earliest universe, prior to the inflationary phase and close to where the classical models predict the big bang singularity. An authoritative answer would require a complete theory of quantum gravity, which has not yet been developed (cf. the section on quantum gravity, below).|$|E
5|$|Further controversies have {{occurred}} {{because of the}} company's involvement in the Middle East. The opening of a Burger King location in the Israeli-occupied territories led to a breach of contract dispute between Burger King and its Israeli franchise; the dispute eventually erupted into a geopolitical conflagration involving Muslim and Jewish groups on multiple continents over the application of and adherence to international law. The case eventually elicited reactions from {{the members of the}} 22-nation Arab League; the Islamic countries within the League made a joint threat to the company of legal sanctions including the revocation of Burger King's business licenses within the member states' territories. A second issue involving members of the Islamic faith over the interpretation of the Muslim version of Canon Law, Shariah, regarding the promotional artwork on a dessert package in the United Kingdom raised issues of cultural sensitivity, and, with the former example, posed a <b>larger</b> <b>question</b> about the lengths that companies must go to insure the smooth operation of their businesses in the communities they serve.|$|E
500|$|Coleen also {{underlines the}} <b>larger</b> <b>question</b> {{of how the}} ground of {{insufficiency}} of evidence relates to, and arguably may be subsumed under, other more established grounds of judicial review. The High Court in Fong Thin Choo drew a link between this ground and that of relevant and irrelevant considerations. Justice Chan held that the [...] "insufficient inquiry" [...] by the Director-General, which satisfied the ground of lack of evidence, constituted a [...] " [...] {{to take into account}} relevant considerations".|$|E

500|$|In 1924 and 1925, McNair and Summerall defended McNair's {{work when}} it was criticized during the {{continuing}} debate {{about the future of}} the Army Air Service. [...] The head of the Air Service, Major General Mason Patrick, argued that the McNair board's findings underestimated the capabilities of bomber aircraft, and that the data the board had compiled was inaccurate. [...] In response, Major General Frank W. Coe, the chief of the Coast Artillery Corps, pointed out that McNair's panel included both Coast Artillery and Air Service officers, and that experiments with aircraft had included coast artillery officers as observers. [...] In addition, the aircrews that participated in the McNair board experiments had the opportunity to provide input and voice concern over the board's methods and conclusions. [...] Coe concluded his argument by recommending that the McNair board's findings be approved by the Army as its official position on the issue of coastal artillery versus bombers for shore defense. [...] Coe's recommendation was not followed; subsequent panels and committees continued to investigate and debate the issue. [...] In addition, the debate continued on the <b>larger</b> <b>question</b> of whether the Air Service should remain a component of the Army or become a separate branch of the military.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Monni and Spaventa {{underline}} that in {{the debate}} between GDP and HDI, it is forgotten that these are both external indicators that purport to privilege different goals as reflective of human welfare.

To Spargo and his fellow right-wingers, it subsumed under its rubric the <b>larger</b> <b>question</b> of where and how the socialist movement was headed, that is, whether it was to be led by those schooled in theoretical Marxian exegesis and historical study or by those who discarded such exegesis and study and opted instead for direct catastrophic action." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Children's Literature Review {{states that}} The Revenge of the Shadow King is [...] "imaginative" [...] and that [...] "the story's fast-paced, {{adventure}} plot is compelling" [...] {{but that it}} [...] "lacks depth, as it fails {{to connect with the}} <b>larger</b> <b>question</b> asked by great [...] fantasy literature."

2500|$|McTaggart remarked, [...] "If {{somebody}} takes a {{third of}} somebody's book, which {{is what happened to}} me, they are lifting out the heart and guts of somebody else's individual expression." [...] Goodwin had previously reached a [...] "private settlement" [...] with McTaggart over the issue. In an article she wrote for Time magazine, she said, [...] "Though my footnotes repeatedly cited Ms. McTaggart's work, I failed to provide quotation marks for phrases that I had taken verbatim... The <b>larger</b> <b>question</b> {{for those of us who}} write history is to understand how citation mistakes can happen." [...] In its analysis of the controversy, Slate criticized Goodwin for the aggrieved tone of her explanation, and suggested Goodwin's worst offense was allowing the plagiarism to remain in future editions of the book even after it was brought to her attention.|$|E

60|$|It is not, therefore, on {{this part}} of the subject, that the {{question}} is likely to be asked, Cui bono? We may be told that the evil would outweigh the good, but the reality of the good admits of no dispute. In regard, however, to the <b>larger</b> <b>question,</b> the removal of women's disabilities--their recognition as the equals of men in all that belongs to citizenship--the opening to them of all honourable employments, and of the training and education which qualifies for those employments--there are many persons for whom it is not enough that the inequality has no just or legitimate defence; they require to be told what express advantage would be obtained by abolishing it.|$|E

But it may be [...] observedâ€”1. That the Mahdi made a trial of marching down the Nile [...] and speedily abandoned it, even in the first flush of his success. [...] 2. That cessation of operations in the Soudan does not at this [...] moment mean our military inaction in the East. 3. That the [...] question is one of conflict, not with the arms of an enemy, but [...] with Nature in respect of climate and supply. 4.

6000|$|Whether birds fear or have instinctive {{knowledge}} {{of any of}} their enemies is a much <b>larger</b> <b>question.</b> Species that run freely on the ground {{from the time of}} quitting the shell know their proper food, and avoid whatever is injurious. Have all young birds a similarly discriminating instinct with regard to their enemies? Darwin says, [...] "Fear of any particular enemy is certainly an instinctive quality, as may be seen in nestling birds." [...] Here, even man seems to be included among the enemies feared instinctively; and in another passage he says, [...] "Young chickens have lost, wholly from habit, that fear of the dog and cat which, no doubt, was originally instinctive in them." [...] My own observations point to a contrary conclusion; and I may say that I have had unrivalled opportunities for studying the habits of young birds.|$|E
