She is at first innocent, loving, and beloved deeply by her father, but she gets mixed up in an affair with her father's enemy as the result of depression brought on by Tiberius' cruelty towards her.

500|$|In {{the latter}} {{years of her}} time in the soap, Pauline changes from a caring mother into a more {{inflexible}} battle-axe.

The two were scheduled to sail to Seattle, but Hogg refused to board the ship. Sobbing, she begged her father to make other arrangements because she [...] "had an awful feeling".

500|$|The {{backstage}} drama {{portrayed in}} the musical was matched by actual difficulties among the cast. McCracken, who played Betty, was the wife of choreographer Bob Fosse and became pregnant during the run. Bill Hayes later wrote that she lost her baby through miscarriage {{about the same time}} she <b>lost</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> to Gwen Verdon. The baby was in fact aborted, because the pregnancy would have endangered McCracken's health {{as a result of her}} diabetes. Hayes noted that in the fifteen months he played Larry, he did not recall ever having a conversation with Isabel Bigley, who was supposedly his love interest and wife: [...] "I doubt that the audience ever believed we were deeply in love." [...] The show received no Tony Award nominations. During the run, Hammerstein followed his usual practice of visiting the theatre now and again to ensure that the performers were not taking liberties with his book. Upon his return, Hammerstein's secretary asked him how the show was going. The lyricist thought for a second, then said [...] "I hate that show." [...] According to Bill Hayes in his autobiography Like Sands Through the Hourglass published in 2005 he states We played nearly five hundred performances, however, all to full houses. Production costs were paid off and substantial profits went into the R till. So, though not in the same category as the storied five that were made into films - Oklahoma!, Carousel, South Pacific, The King and I and The Sound of Music - our show must be considered a success.|$|E

50|$|As {{the years}} went by, Emperor Huan became {{increasingly}} disgruntled at Liang Ji's {{control of the government}} and was also angered by Empress Liang's behavior. Because of her position as Empress Dowager Liang and Liang Ji's sister, Empress Liang was wasteful in her luxurious living, far exceeding any past empress, and was exceedingly jealous. She did not have a son and, because she did not want any other imperial consorts to have sons, she would find some way to murder pregnant consorts. Emperor Huan did not dare to react to her due to Liang Ji's power, but rarely had sexual relations with her. In 159, angry and depressed that she had <b>lost</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband's</b> favor, Empress Liang died.|$|R
