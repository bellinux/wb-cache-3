500|$|Bleeding Through's The Truth {{album was}} {{released}} on January 10, 2006 through Trustkill Records. The album was produced by Rob Caggiano, lead guitarist of Anthrax. The band decided to rebuild their sound from the ground up, quoting to Alternative Press as [...] "Taking out the Metalcore, and then adding the metal into hardcore, if that makes any sense." [...] (--Scott Danough, guitarist). [...] "I don't think this album sounds <b>like</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> out there right now. We're {{very proud of that}} fact." [...] says guitarist Brian Leppke.|$|E
500|$|Reznor called Year Zero a [...] "shift in direction" [...] {{in that it}} [...] "doesn't {{sound like}} With Teeth". [...] He also {{said that when he}} {{finishes}} a new album, he has to [...] "go into battle with the people {{whose job it is to}} figure out how to sell the record. The only time that didn't happen was [...] With Teeth. This time, however, [...] expecting an epic struggle. [...] is not a particularly friendly record and it certainly doesn't sound <b>like</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> out there right now." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{suppose the}} typical Southerner, <b>like</b> the typical <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> is pretty {{difficult}} to find," [...] said March. [...] "But perhaps Miss Woodburn represents the new South. The modern conditions must be producing a modern type." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{song was}} also well-liked by the band. Mick Avory, who noted the song {{as one of}} the songs he was most proud to be {{associated}} with, said [...] "I always liked 'Lola', I liked the subject. It's not <b>like</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> I liked it for that. We'd always take a different path". In a 1983 interview, Ray Davies said, [...] "I'm just very pleased I recorded it and more pleased I wrote it". The band revisited the [...] "Lola" [...] character in the lyrics of their 1981 song, [...] "Destroyer", a minor chart hit in America.|$|E
500|$|The cover, {{created by}} Royston Knipe, {{was based on}} Francisco Goya's etching The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters. It {{features}} Baratte in his pistachio green silk Charvet suit replacing the recumbent Goya in his self-portrait. Instead of the owls and bats which assail Goya in The Sleep of Reason, Knipe used ravens. The cover was noted by The Guardian writer John Dugdale, in {{an article about the}} marketing aspect of book cover design, as being unique in the current market. He stated that; along with the covers for The Sense of an Ending and The Tiger's Wife; [...] "None of the three looks <b>like</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> in bookshops".|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the actors}} had {{basketball}} experience, such as Krasinski, who played for his high school team. Brian Baumgartner, who portrays Kevin, actually succeeded in making 14 free-throw shots, of which several {{were included in the}} final footage. Steve Carell later said of his basketball skills, [...] "The thing about looking like you're bad at basketball is, it's <b>like</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> you have to be incredibly good in order to look bad [...] but that's not the case with me and basketball. I just was bad." [...] However, Carell joked that he would [...] "kick ass" [...] at a hockey episode, a reference to his real-life hockey skills.|$|E
6000|$|... "And very pretty," [...] {{interposed}} Lady Mallinger, with {{an amiable}} wish to help Deronda. [...] "And she has very good manners. I'm sorry she's a bigoted Jewess; I should not <b>like</b> it for <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> but it doesn't matter in singing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know," [...] she said, {{suddenly}} turning towards me, [...] "what I would <b>like</b> {{better than}} <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> in this world? I {{would like to}} be able to stand in the middle of the road and stop a horse as you did!" ...|$|R

500|$|More {{mixed reviews}} were {{critical}} of Diamandis' vocal delivery. Lou Thomas from BBC Music commented that [...] "he consistently diverting changes in style across the album are fine—the wonky 80s shoulder-pad pop of 'The Outsider' is nothing <b>like</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> here, for example. But over 13 songs of Sparks-voice and many similar staccato piano riffs listeners may feel bludgeoned by Marina and her slightly overbearing presence", concluding that her eccentric vocals would polarise opinions. Sean O'Neal wrote on The A.V. Club that after [...] "dozens of squeaky Regina Spektor-ish enunciations" [...] and [...] "Kate Bush trills", the [...] "overbearing {{need to prove}} herself just ends up being exhausting". Joe Rivers of No Ripcord praised [...] "Are You Satisfied?", [...] "Hollywood" [...] and [...] "Oh No!" [...] but was put off by sudden [...] "howling" [...] in [...] "Hermit the Frog" [...] and a [...] "throaty growl" [...] in [...] "The Outsider".|$|E
500|$|Lancaster, however, {{kept an eye}} on {{the public}} {{scrutiny}} surrounding Lopez. Olivier Van Doorne, worldwide creative director at Select Communications, said: [...] "Whenever you take a celebrity into a commercial venture, which {{more and more people are}} doing, there's enormous risk [...] It doesn't take much to turn the public around overnight." [...] Mark Malinowski, director for entertainment marketing at Ketchum, part of the Omnicom, said the situation [...] "will reach a point where, <b>like</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> there may be overexposure". Lancaster's marketing vice president Catherine Walsh remarked in a statement: [...] "The worst thing in the world would be to unplug Glow to introduce Still". Still Jennifer Lopez was released in October 2003. While Glow by JLo was aimed at the female market at girls between the age of 15 and 25, Still Jennifer Lopez was aimed to appeal to an older demographic of females 25 and above, according to Rebecca Murray of About.com.|$|E
500|$|Wired {{reported}} that the iPhone 5 design, carried on in the iPhone 5S and iPhone SE, was regarded as [...] "long been the golden child of Apple phone design and a benchmark for phones in general", while the succeeding iPhone 6/6S design was less critically acclaimed as it [...] "felt a little bit wrong, as though you were holding a slick $650 bar of soap". Wired described the iPhone 5 as [...] "elegance rooted {{in the way the}} aluminum and glass work together. It felt streamlined, yet substantial, which is different from the iPhone 6, which feels substantial in size alone. Plus, unlike the ubiquitous rounded corners of the 6, the iPhone 5 didn’t really look <b>like</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> on the market at the time". However, the iPhone 5's design was not suited to scaling up, in contrast to the iPhone 6/6S which could better accommodate the growing consumer trend towards larger screen sizes and indeed spawned the 6/6S Plus phablet models.|$|E

"Yes, dear, more <b>like</b> {{this than}} <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> {{you have ever}} seen; but the sun does not always shine so brightly as it does just now, and {{sometimes}} there are terrible snow-storms.

"It wasn't no kind thought, Mrs. Andrews, {{but they}} spoke to me about it, and I knew that a piano was what we should <b>like</b> better than <b>{{anything}}</b> <b>else,</b> and I didn't say anything about it, because Bob Grimstone {{thought that it would}} be nicer to be a surprise to George as well as to you." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{watched her}} face {{narrowly}} while {{he spoke with}} such seeming carelessness. Instead of the agitation of jealousy that he had expected to be aroused by this hint of another woman in the case, there was a curious expression, more <b>like</b> embarrassment than <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> {{which might have been}} fairly attributed to the subject. 'Can it be that I am mistaken?' he asked himself.|$|R
500|$|Ryan Burleson of Consequence of Sound {{commented that}} Rihanna's {{combines}} different emotions {{in the song}} to increase the level of provocativeness, writing [...] "For its part, the Soundz-produced 'Skin' combines these emotions into a five-minute space-hop excursion into the boudoir, driving deep into the id with an austere, though undeniably potent amount of minor chords and bass." [...] Andy Kellman of AllMusic chose [...] "Skin" [...] {{as one of the}} highlights on Loud, writing, [...] "One song that sounds nothing <b>like</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> in Rihanna's past is 'Skin,' a contender for anti-gravity slow jam of 2010 [...] a match for Trey Songz's 'Red Lipstick' and Usher's 'Mars vs Venus. USA Todays Steve Jones also put the song in his list of tracks from Loud to consider downloading. Jerry Shriver of the same publication found [...] "down-and-dirty-ness" [...] in the chorus of the song. James Skinner of BBC Online said that the line [...] "I like it rough" [...] was a little [...] "uncomfortable in the light of her personal history". Thomas Conner of Chicago Sun-Times commented on Rihanna's sex appeal in the song, writing [...] "the art of her seduction is oh-so slow and merciless".|$|E
500|$|As of 2015–16, {{there were}} still a {{significant}} number of customers who preferred the 4-inch screen size of iPhone 5S, which remained the second-most popular iPhone after the iPhone 6 and ahead of the iPhone 6S. Apple stated in their event that they sold 30 million 4-inch iPhones in 2015, even as that form factor was succeeded as the flagship iPhone by the redesigned larger display 4.7/5.5-inch iPhone 6 and 6 Plus back in September 2014. Furthermore, the 5 and 5S design was regarded as [...] "long been the golden child of Apple phone design and a benchmark for phones in general" [...] (with the 5S's gold finish adding a premium touch to the 5's already well-regarded look), while the succeeding 6 and 6S design was less critically acclaimed as it [...] "felt a little bit wrong, as though you were holding a slick $650 bar of soap". The iPhone 5 was described as [...] "elegance rooted in the way the aluminum and glass work together. It felt streamlined, yet substantial, which is different from iPhone 6, which feels substantial in size alone. Plus, unlike the ubiquitous rounded corners of the 6, iPhone 5 didn’t really look <b>like</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> on the market at the time". However, the iPhone 5/5S design was not suited to scaling up, in contrast to the iPhone 6/6S which could better accommodate the growing consumer trend towards larger screen sizes and indeed spawned the 6/6S Plus phablet models. When Apple discontinued the iPhone 5S, it was replaced by the iPhone SE which outwardly appears almost identical to the 5S even as the SE's internal hardware has been upgraded significantly.|$|E
2500|$|Cold 187um's {{association}} with Insane Clown Posse was criticized by both fans of West Coast hip hop and Juggalos. Cold 187um {{responded to the}} criticism, stating [...] "The Only Solution project was an innovative good idea between myself and Violent J, but everyone is so damn opinionated these days and not going {{with the idea of}} the artist’s creativity, the project was harder than it needed to be. We are all independent, we are all against mainstream music, we all should have been one not separate. That goes for both Juggalos and my West Coast Hip Hop fans. We might come from different places but we are all on the same side, fighting the same fight. It’s <b>like</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> in life, if there is no unity the real enemy will always win. End of story." ...|$|E
6000|$|I am awfully {{sorry about}} Tregear. I can't quite make out [...] how it happened. I suppose {{you were too}} near him, and [...] Melrose always does rush at his fences.

2500|$|Both the Shurangama Sutra and the Lankavatara Sutra {{describe}} the tathagatagarbha ("arahant womb") [...] as [...] "by nature brightly shining and pure," [...] and [...] "originally pure," [...] though [...] "enveloped in the garments of the skandhas, dhatus and ayatanas and soiled with the dirt of attachment, hatred, delusion and false imagining." [...] It {{is said to}} be [...] "naturally pure," [...] but it appears impure as it is stained by adventitious defilements. Thus the Lankavatara Sutra identifies the luminous mind of the Canon with the tathagatagarbha. (Some Gelug philosophers, in contrast to teachings in the Lankavatara Sutra, maintain that the [...] "purity" [...] of the tathagatagarbha is not because it is originally or fundamentally pure, but because mental flaws can be removed — that is, <b>like</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> they are not part of an individual's fundamental essence. These thinkers thus refuse to turn epistemological insight about emptiness and Buddha-nature into an essentialist metaphysics.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The Sun {{described}} the album as [...] "a mixture of ballads and the relentlessly upbeat, catchy hits {{we have come}} to expect." [...] Kimberley Walsh has said that the album is [...] "a lot older sounding, which wasn't intentional, it was just kind of how it went." [...] The girl group were very involved in the album's direction. [...] "The '60s thing is quite prominent," [...] Walsh told the BBC. [...] "But it's out of the ordinary. Not really what you'd expect." [...] Nicola Roberts said that the album also features a lot of 1980s-inspired electropop. Sarah Harding said that Girls Aloud [...] "wanted to stay upbeat but try something a bit different and advanced. I don't think anything we've ever done has ever sounded the same. But we have that same vibe whatever we do because of our vocals." [...] Nadine Coyle said the [...] "aim from the beginning was to come up with songs that didn't sound <b>like</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> out there." [...] Walsh continued, [...] "We want to impress the fans with what we do, so we've tried to up our game with this album and step outside the comfort zone." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{market for}} art and {{cultural}} property is international. Demand is intense and not particularly local {{in terms of}} consumer preference. 2 Supply responds to this intense international demand. <b>Like</b> most <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> art finds its way to whomever is prepared to pay for it. Regulation affects how it arrives at its ultimate destination, but generally does not prevent it from getting there. Apart from this international market, legal and policy aspects of art and cultural property have a distinctly international flavor due to historical circumstance. Since many works over time {{have been removed from}} their source by way of conquest, expropriation, or theft, claims for cross-border restoration or restitution inevitably involve international law and policy considerations. Even a simple exhibition agreement at a foreign museum may generate complex issues of domestic and international private and public law...|$|R

If Poqua-dilla should be recognized as a queen, and crowned, and provided with an income sufficient to keep her out of any retail business, it was about all she could expect, at her time of life. She certainly would not care to do any governing. The few subjects that we should enlist would be more <b>like</b> courtiers than <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b>|$|R
