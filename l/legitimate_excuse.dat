50|$|Truancy is any intentional, unjustified, unauthorized, {{or illegal}} absence from {{compulsory}} education. It is absence caused by students {{of their own}} free will, and usually does not refer to <b>legitimate</b> <b>excused</b> absences, such as ones related to medical conditions. Truancy is usually explicitly defined in the school's handbook of policies and procedures. Some children whose parents claim to homeschool have also been found truant in the United States.

He had always cherished a certain tenderness for her; he must marry somebody with money before long; and though Millicent's means were not so large as Bella's, they were not contemptible.

It was more graceful to reflect that Millicent possessed refinement, a degree of beauty, and many most desirable qualities.|$|E

Now all that was, if Brander's fears were realized, at an end, even if it should not {{turn out to be}} as bad as that, the sum he would be called upon to pay might be sufficient to cripple the estate and to afford him a good and <b>legitimate</b> <b>excuse</b> for shutting up or letting the house, and going away to retrench until the liabilities were all cleared off. Of course he would have to work in earnest now, but even the thought of that was not altogether unpleasant.|$|E

He had {{no desire}} to follow this strange white man who was afraid at night; he had less to remain at the tender mercies of the Big Bwana's lusty warriors, between whom and his people there was long-standing blood feud; and he was more than delighted, into the bargain, for a <b>legitimate</b> <b>excuse</b> for deserting his much hated Swede master. He knew a way to the north and his own country that the white men did not know--a short cut across an arid plateau where lay water holes of which the white hunters and explorers that had passed from time to time the fringe of the dry country had never dreamed. He might even elude the Big Bwana should he follow them, and with this thought {{uppermost}} in his mind he gathered the remnants of Malbihn's safari into a semblance of order and moved off toward the north. And toward the southwest the black boy led the Hon. Morison Baynes into the jungles.|$|E
60|$|Miriam {{combined}} earnestness {{of spirit}} with great practical incapacity. The house was never clean nor tidy, but always being frightfully disarranged for cleaning or tidying up, and she cooked because food {{had to be}} cooked and with a sound moralist's entire disregard {{of the quality of}} the consequences. The food came from her hands done rather than improved, and looking as uncomfortable as savages clothed under duress by a missionary with a stock of out-sizes. Such food is too apt to behave resentfully, rebel and work Obi. She ceased to listen to her husband's talk from the day she married him, and ceased to unwrinkle the kink in her brow at his presence, giving herself up to mental states that had a quality of secret preoccupation. And she developed an idea for which perhaps there was <b>legitimate</b> <b>excuse,</b> that he was lazy. He seemed to stand about in the shop a great deal, to read--an indolent habit--and presently to seek company for talking. He began to attend the bar parlour of the God's Providence Inn with some frequency, and would have done so regularly in the evening if cards, which bored him to death, had not arrested conversation. But the perpetual foolish variation of the permutations and combinations of two and fifty cards taken five at a time, and the meagre surprises and excitements that ensue had no charms for Mr. Polly's mind, which was at once too vivid in its impressions and too easily fatigued.|$|E

30|$|Like their urban {{professional}} counterparts, young rural migrants {{also believe}} that commemorating their wedding in photographic terms is a meaningful thing to do, since marriage is supposed to happen ‘only once in a lifetime’ and it is therefore important to mark it. In this sense, they are not dissimilar to their counterparts in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea, who use bridal portraiture to document, witness and authenticate an important ritual. At the same time, unlike their urban Chinese counterparts, the professional bridal photography among young rural migrants is {{more often than not}} an aspirational consumption, signifying a capacity to participate in the process of becoming urban and modern. Zhang Y.X., also at Foxconn, is yet to find a boyfriend, but she expects professional wedding photos to {{be an integral part of}} getting married—although she herself does not see the point of it except as a once-in-a-life-time excuse to indulge herself. Unlike urban professional Huang F. discussed earlier, who considers herself a reluctant ‘actor’ and a ‘puppet’ in these photo shoots, Zhang thinks this will be the only day in her life when she gets to be treated as special: ‘I know why we [rural migrant workers] want to do it. It’s because we’re poor, and there are not that many <b>legitimate</b> <b>excuses</b> to indulge ourselves except for this’. Zhang’s desire to be treated as someone special just for once in her lifetime echoes the sentiment expressed by rural migrant brides in Taiwan in Adrian’s study (2006).|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} the first to analyze a {{pervasive}} and unexplored constitutional problem: the rights of crime victims against unconstitutional discrimination by juries. From the Emmett Till trial to that of Rodney King, there is a long history of juries acquitting white defendants charged with violence against black victims. Modem empirical evidence continues to show a devaluation of black victims; dramatic disparities exist in death sentence and rape conviction rates according to the race of the victim. Moreover, just as juries have permitted violence against those who allegedly violated the racial order, juries use acquittals to punish female victims of rape and domestic violence for failing to meet gender norms. Statistical studies show that the 2 ̆ 2 appropriateness 2 ̆ 2 of a female victim 2 ̆ 7 s behavior {{is one of the most}} accurate predictors of conviction for gender-based violence. Discriminatory acquittals violate the Constitution. Jurors may not constitutionally discriminate against victims of crimes any more than they may discriminate against defendants. Jurors are bound by the Equal Protection Clause because their verdicts constitute state action, a point that has received surprisingly little scholarly analysis. Finally, defendants have no countervailing right to jury nullification based on race or gender discrimination against victims. The Sixth Amendment promises defendants an 2 ̆ 2 impartial 2 ̆ 2 jury, not a partial one. Double jeopardy prohibits a direct remedy for the problem of discriminatory acquittal, and jury secrecy makes proof difficult. Yet recognizing the unconstitutionality of discriminatory acquittal would result in fundamental normative shifts. It would create a new constitutional language for prosecutors and judges to protect victims against jury discrimination within our existing criminal procedure. Most of all, the pervasiveness of discriminatory acquittals could no longer serve as a <b>legitimating</b> <b>excuse</b> for police and prosecutors to magnify the problem by conducting their own anticipatory underenforcement of the law...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory I and II {{will provide}} you with an {{opportunity}} to integrate knowledge from the different areas of Food Science and to obtain a better understanding of food as a complete entity. The lab exercises have been designed to reinforce the theoretical concepts covered in the courses on food microbiology, chemistry, analysis, quality control, processing, and develop practical skills required for employment in the food industry. These practical skills include working cooperatively in a group, and oral and written presentation of information, in addition to developing expertise in commonly used laboratory skills. Each course is divided into two modules. Module 325 - 1 will emphasize laboratory skill development, while modules 325 - 2, 326 - 1, and 326 - 2 each deal with a specific food commodity. You will become familiar with the composition and characteristics of these materials, the equipment and procedures for analysis and processing, research and data analysis, and presentation of information in both written and oral formats. At the completion of each module, you will share your results {{with the rest of the}} class. Course Absences Participation in all of the laboratories is required. Absence from any of the laboratories must be supported by documentation. For <b>legitimate</b> <b>excuses,</b> you may be required to attend a make-up session, to be arranged with the instructor. Failure to obtain results due to poor laboratory technique or inadequate preparation for the lab will result in the deduction of marks from your lab report and oral presentation.

Historians have treated these opinions as part of the vast polemical literature uniformly intended to justify an impending Ottoman attack against their Safavid rivals. Questioning the notion that all authors shared an undifferentiated attitude, this article underlines that, unlike most polemical literature, {{the opinions of}} these three jurists focused on the religiolegal aspects of the Safavid issue and varied and evolved in line with changing historical realities, the jurists’ divergent assessments of the Safavid threat, and their preference for different jurisprudential doctrines. Based on an analysis of the opinions, I argue that these jurists assumed a high degree of autonomy as producers and interpreters of the law and thus did not necessarily feel obliged to <b>legitimate</b> or <b>excuse</b> every imperial action...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{contemporary arts}} practice and interdisciplinary modes of exchange. It argues for a framework recognising {{the importance of}} borders, specifically to cross-disciplinary dialogue. Syzygy is an astronomical term, when three planets align. This has become an investigative model in approaching my practice, where a union of opposites reach resolution. I aim to use my arts practice and examples of current collaborations to reinforce this position. My visual arts practice utilises unlike materials that resist one another, creating heterogeneous forms. This transformative action results in an equilibrium: opposing forces of energy and exchange. Without this action, the structures would inevitably blend into homogeneity. Thus on a material level, resistance produces a necessary clarity – through unseen force. The same opposing force is vital to interdisciplinary modes of exchange, for a resistant, collaborative dynamism. The term ‘interdisciplinary’ can be misused to <b>legitimate</b> or <b>excuse</b> misguided cross-disciplinary research. This paper also proposes that interdisciplinary research can employ a syzygetical model, engaging mutually incompatible fields. In recognising the necessity of these borders to co-research, inter-relationships are viewed in a new light. Resistance and equilibrium are key factors within this critique, and I cite examples from my studio practice as the benefits of this transformative action. Collaborative projects with nanotechnologist, Chris Malajczuk, illustrations from SymbioticA, theorists and select artists will also be presented. This will reinforce the key idea that arts practice benefits from dynamic, dialogic force...|$|R
