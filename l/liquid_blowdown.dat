40|$|Increased {{concern over}} the {{continued}} availability of cheap oil and gas, combined with environmental concern relating to the large-scale combustion of fossil fuels {{has led to a}} renewal of interest in the absorption refrigeration cycle. The aqua-ammonia cycle is particularly suitable for applications in the process industries, where the refrigerant is required to be at temperatures below 0 Â°C. A modification of the conventional cycle configuration is proposed and investigated. The modified cycle employs <b>liquid</b> <b>blowdown</b> from the evaporator to provide reflux for the distillation-column generator. This modification can be employed to eliminate the use of fresh refrigerant, from the condenser, as reflux in the conventional aqua-ammonia absorption refrigeration cycle. Simulations of the modified cycle, using the PROCESS(TM) computer simulation package, predict an improvement in the coefficient of performance (COP) of approximately 5 % coupled with a net reduction in the total heat-transfer area required. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Reusable Reentry Satellite (RRS) Propulsion System Trade Study {{described}} in this summary report was to investigate various propulsion options available for incorporation on the RRS and to select the option best suited for RRS application. The design requirements for the RRS propulsion system were driven by the total impulse requirements necessary to operate within the performance envelope specified in the RRS System Requirements Documents. These requirements were incorporated within the Design Reference Missions (DRM's) identified for use in this and other subsystem trade studies. This study investigated the following propulsion systems: solid rocket, monopropellant, bipropellant (monomethyl hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide or MMH/NTO), dual-mode bipropellant (hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide or N 2 H 4 /NTO), liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen (LO 2 /LH 2), and an advanced design propulsion system using SDI-developed components. A <b>liquid</b> monopropellant <b>blowdown</b> propulsion system {{was found to be}} best suited for meeting the RRS requirements and is recommended as the baseline system. This system was chosen because it is the simplest of all investigated, has the fewest components, and is the most cost effective. The monopropellant system meets all RRS performance requirements and has the capability to provide a very accurate deorbit burn which minimizes reentry dispersions. In addition, no new hardware qualification is required for a monopropellant system. Although the bipropellant systems offered some weight savings capability for missions requiring large deorbit velocities, the advantage of a lower mass system only applies if the total vehicle design can be reduced to allow a cheaper launch vehicle to be used. At the time of this trade study, the overall RRS weight budget and launch vehicle selection were not being driven by the propulsion system selection. Thus, the added cost and complexity of more advanced systems did not warrant application...|$|R
