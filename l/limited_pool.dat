25|$|If {{her good}} looks, strong clear voice, and lively wit were {{responsible}} for catching the eye of Killigrew, she still had to prove herself clever enough to succeed as an actress. This was no easy task in the Restoration theatre; the <b>limited</b> <b>pool</b> of audience members meant that very short runs were the norm for plays and fifty different productions might be mounted in the nine-month season lasting from September to June. She was reputed to have been illiterate.|$|E
25|$|Operation Pigfat {{had killed}} {{hundreds}} of communist troops; the relief column's 148th Regiment was committed only 13 days and suffered 120 {{killed in action}} and 280 wounded. Group 766, which they aided, ended the campaign with fewer than 480 men in its three battalions. These casualties {{would have to be}} replaced. According to the U.S. Air Force, the Royalists suffered 40 killed and 131 wounded in action. According to another source, out of the 1,800 Hmong guerrillas committed to battle, there were about 300 killed in action, 500 wounded, and 400 gone missing. They had never before taken a casualty rate of over 50 percent. In either case, Hmong replacement for casualties was difficult, due to their <b>limited</b> <b>pool</b> of recruits. The Hmong withdrew with the PAVN pressing them. The PAVN communists captured Nakhang and dispatched the commanding officer, who doubled as both commander and province governor; this cemented communist control over the province. Nakhang would remain in communist hands henceforth.|$|E
500|$|After graduation, Nolan {{worked as}} a script reader, camera operator, and {{director}} of corporate videos and industrial films. He also made a third short, Doodlebug (1997), about a man chasing an insect around a flat with a shoe, only to discover when killing it {{that it is a}} miniature of himself. During this period of his career, Nolan had little or no success getting his projects off the ground; he later recalled the [...] "stack of rejection letters" [...] that greeted his early forays into making films, adding [...] "there's a very <b>limited</b> <b>pool</b> of finance in the UK. To be honest, it's a very clubby kind of place... Never had any support whatsoever from the British film industry." ...|$|E

500|$|A game of Magic {{involves}} two or {{more players}} who {{are engaged in a}} battle acting as powerful wizards called planeswalkers. [...] Each player has their own deck, either one previously constructed or made from a <b>limited</b> <b>pool</b> of cards for the event. A player starts the game with twenty [...] "life points" [...] and loses the game when their life total is reduced to zero. A player can also lose if they must draw from an empty deck. In addition, some cards specify other ways to win or lose the game. Garfield has stated that two major influences in his creation of Magic: the Gathering were the games Cosmic Encounter, which first used the concept that normal rules could sometimes be overridden, and Dungeons & Dragons. [...] The [...] "Golden Rule of Magic" [...] states that [...] "Whenever a card's text directly contradicts the rules, the card takes precedence." [...] The Comprehensive Rules, a detailed rulebook, exists to clarify conflicts.|$|E
500|$|For Final Fantasy VIII, Hiroyuki Ito {{designed}} a battle {{system based on}} summon-able monsters, called [...] "Guardian Forces", abbreviated in-game as [...] "GF". Assigning ("junctioning") a GF onto a character allows the player to use battle commands beyond Attack with the main weapon, such as Magic, GF (to summon the junctioned GF and have it perform an action), and Item. While previous Final Fantasy titles provided each character with a <b>limited</b> <b>pool</b> of magic points that were consumed by each spell, in Final Fantasy VIII, spells are acquired ("drawn") either from enemies in battle, Draw Points distributed throughout the game's environments, or by refining items and cards. Spells are then stocked on characters as quantified inventory (up to 100 per spell and limited to 32 distinct spells per character) and are consumed one by one when used. Characters can also junction these spells onto their statistics—such as Strength, Vitality, and Luck—for various bonuses, provided the character has junctioned a Guardian Force. The junction system's flexibility affords the player {{a wide range of}} customization options.|$|E
2500|$|The {{regiment}} {{was raised}} on 17 May 1794 in Aberdeenshire, and was initially known as [...] "Hay's" [...] or the Aberdeenshire Regiment. Leith-Hay {{was reported to}} have offered between 20 and 25 guineas bounty as an incentive to recruits in Aberdeen and also gave his recruits a written promise {{that they would not be}} drafted into another regiment. [...] Leith-Hay adopted the [...] "Aberdeenshire" [...] name for the regiment, apparently causing a dispute with the rival Huntly Gordon family who had originally considered the name for their 100th Regiment of Foot (which instead became known as the Gordon Highlanders). The 100th and 109th regiments reflected the rivalries of their colonels, with both attempting various means to recruit from the <b>limited</b> <b>pool</b> of available men in north-east Scotland. Officers of the Gordons complained that the Aberdeen town council showed favour to the 109th over their regiment. The rivalry extended to the Highland Fencible Corps too, with Leith-Hay's brother, James, raising the Aberdeenshire Fencibles in 1795 in direct rivalry to the Duke of Gordon's Northern Fencibles. Leith-Hay was able to furnish his regiment with experienced officers, his majors, captains and all bar one of his lieutenants already holding commissions in other regiments. Upon its first muster the regiment comprised 32 sergeants, 30 corporals, 22 drummers and 610 privates. The officer corps comprised Leith-Hay, 2 majors, 8 captains, 14 lieutenants, 15 ensigns, a chaplain, surgeon, adjutant and quartermaster (though not all of these served at one time, with some resigning or joining later).|$|E
40|$|The {{tradeoff}} {{between an}} insurer's or medical provider's incentives to select good risks and to produce efficiently {{is governed by}} the supply-price analog to the demand-price tradeoff between moral hazard and risk aversion. Under a variety of models the optimum supply price {{is a mixture of}} capitation and fee-for-service payments. Empirical literature shows that pure capitation payment leaves strong incentives for selection that are acted upon. The presence of contracting costs in a Rothschild-Stiglitz model means a <b>limited</b> <b>pooling</b> equilibrium can exist and that poor risks will not be at their preferred outcome. ...|$|R

40|$|Deep {{sequencing}} {{will soon}} generate comprehensive sequence information in large disease samples. Although {{the power to}} detect association with an individual rare variant is <b>limited,</b> <b>pooling</b> variants by gene or pathway into a composite test provides an alternative strategy for identifying susceptibility genes. We describe a statistical method for detecting association of multiple rare variants in protein-coding genes with a quantitative or dichotomous trait. The approach {{is based on the}} regression of phenotypic values on individuals' genotype scores subject to a variable allele-frequency threshold, incorporating computational predictions of the functional effects of missense variants. Statistical significance is assessed by permutation testing with variable thresholds. We used a rigorous population-genetics simulation framework to evaluate the power of the method, and we applied the method to empirical sequencing data from three disease studies...|$|R

50|$|Unilateral lesions {{of various}} brain {{structures}} {{can cause a}} failure to sense contralesional stimuli {{in the absence of}} obvious sensory losses. This failure is deﬁned as unilateral extinction if it occurs solely in the case of simultaneous bilateral sensory stimulations. Unilateral extinction can occur with bilateral visual, auditory and tactile stimuli, as well as with bilateral cross-modal stimulations of these sensory systems, and is more frequent following right hemisphere brain damage (RHD) than left hemisphere brain damage (LHD). Unilateral sensory extinction is thought by most to be explained by competition models of selective attention where each stimulus competes to gain access to <b>limited</b> <b>pools</b> of attentional resources. Because of a special role of the right hemisphere in attention, lesions of that hemisphere would disadvantage sensory inputs from the contralateral left hemispace relative from those from the right space.|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} {{hypotheses}} {{about the nature}} of the capacity limit. One is that a <b>limited</b> <b>pool</b> of cognitive resources needed to keep representations active and thereby available for processing, and for carrying out processes.
