The {{movement}} grew more passionate: the fiddlers behind the <b>luminous</b> <b>pillar</b> of cloud now and then varied the air by playing on the wrong side of the bridge or with the back of the bow. But it did not matter; the panting shapes spun onwards.|$|E

6000|$|I {{have run}} where festival was loud [...] With drum and brass among the crowd [...] Of panic revellers, whose cries [...] Affront {{the quiet of}} the skies; [...] Whose dancing lights {{contract}} the deep [...] Infinity of night and sleep [...] To a narrow turmoil of troubled fire. [...] And I have found my heart's desire [...] In beechen caverns that autumn fills [...] With the blue shadowiness of distant hills; [...] Whose <b>luminous</b> grey <b>pillars</b> bear [...] The stooping sky: calm is the air, [...] Nor any sound is heard to mar [...] That crystal silence--as from far, [...] Far off a man may see [...] The busy world all utterly [...] Hushed as an old memorial scene. [...] Long evenings I have sat and been [...] Strangely content, while in my hands [...] I held a wealth of coloured strands, [...] Shimmering plaits of silk and skeins [...] Of soft bright wool. Each colour drains [...] New life at the lamp's round pool of gold; [...] Each sinks again when I withhold [...] The quickening radiance, to a wan [...] And shadowy oblivion [...] Of what it was. And in my mind [...] Beauty or sudden love has shined [...] And wakened colour in what was dead [...] And turned to gold the sullen lead [...] Of mean desires and everyday's [...] Poor thoughts and customary ways. [...] Sometimes in lands where mountains throw [...] Their silent spell on all below, [...] Drawing a magic circle wide [...] About their feet on every side, [...] Robbed of all speech and thought and act, [...] I have seen God in the cataract. [...] In falling water and in flame, [...] Never at rest, yet still the same, [...] God shows himself. And I have known [...] The swift fire frozen into stone, [...] And water frozen changelessly [...] Into the death of gems. And I [...] Long sitting by the thunderous mill [...] Have seen the headlong wheel made still, [...] And in the silence that ensued [...] Have known the endless solitude [...] Of being dead and utterly nought. [...] Inhabitant of mine own thought, [...] I look abroad, and all I see [...] Is my creation, made for me: [...] Along my thread of life are pearled [...] The moments {{that make up the}} world.|$|R
