40|$|Purpose of {{this paper}} is to develop {{mathematical}} models of the treatment methods using <b>loose</b> <b>solid</b> balls. Analysis of treatment with the use of <b>loose</b> <b>solid</b> balls behaviour is carried out for modelling. The operating factors such as geometrical parameters of a nozzle, distance to the treated surface, and pressure of compressed air and outlet factors such as level of strengthening, depth of hardened layer are determined. It is proposed to put into basis of the mathematical models the energy conception that permit for unification and simplification of mathematical description of the processes. The level of strengthening, and depth of hardened layer are estimated for the plain surfaces by means of created mathematical models. Design/methodology/approach: The main methods used for the theoretical research are mathematical modelling, integral calculus, fundamentals of analytic geometry, theory of probability, hydraulics of multiphase flow. The main methods used for the experimental investigations were conducted by receiving diagrams of surface roughness, microhardness of the oblique slices of the treated samples, speckle interferograms of the surfaces treated using <b>loose</b> <b>solid</b> balls. Findings: A method of mathematical modelling for treatment with the use of <b>loose</b> <b>solid</b> balls is developed based on the energy conception. The mathematical model is created and allows calculating the characteristics of surface quality depending on the technological modes of treatment. Research limitations/implications: It is planned to develop and improve the methods of mathematical modelling of the treatment using <b>loose</b> <b>solid</b> balls in future research by extending them for the curvilinear treated surfaces, which are characterised by a movement relative to the nozzle. Practical implications: have the applied software, elaborated on the basis of the models, that allows providing for automation of calculations of the characteristics of surface quality depending on the technological modes of the treatment. Originality/value: It is pioneered to receive functional dependences between depth of a hardening layer, changing microhardness, degree of hardening and the parameters of equipment, blast of <b>loose</b> <b>solid</b> balls, and working medium. The created functional dependences take the distribution of characteristics of working medium into account (mass and velocity) all along the cross-sections of the blast...|$|R

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} study the importance of early rumen development and of the composition of <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> intake on growth performance and abomasal health in milk-fed veal calves. One hundred and six Holstein-Friesian male calves {{were included in the}} experiment, and studied during 2 successive 12 -wk periods (period 1 and period 2). In a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement, effects of partially replacing milk replacer by <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> during period 1 and partially replacing dry matter (DM) intake from maize silage and barley straw by concentrate during period 2 were tested. <b>Solid</b> <b>feed</b> during period 1 consisted of maize silage, barley straw, and concentrate (25 : 25 : 50 on a DM basis). <b>Solid</b> <b>feed</b> during period 2 consisted of maize silage and barley straw (50 : 50 ratio on DM basis) for the nonconcentrate groups, and maize silage, barley straw and concentrates (25 : 25 : 50 on a DM basis) for the concentrate groups. At the end of period 1 (n = 16) {{and at the end of}} period 2 (n = 90), parameters of animal performance, rumen development, rumen fermentation, ruminal drinking, and abomasal damage were examined. Partially replacing milk replacer by <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> during period 1 resulted in early rumen development (ERD) at the end of period 1, characterized by increased rumen weight, and an increased epithelial and absorptive surface area. Both ERD and partially replacing roughage by concentrates in period 2 increased the rumen development score at the end of period 2. Although ERD calves consumed more <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> and less milk replacer during period 1 and 2 than non-ERD calves, carcass weight gains at 25 wk were identical, and utilization of the <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> provided appeared similar to that of milk replacer. Partially replacing roughage by concentrates in period 2 increased dressing percentage and warm carcass weight. Plaque formation at the rumen mucosa was unaffected by ERD or partially replacing roughage by concentrates and generally low in all calves. The prevalence of large scars in the abomasum in ERD calves was decreased compared with non-ERD calves. This may indicate that ERD provided protection against abomasal lesions. In conclusion, early compared with late rumen development improves feed utilization and may be beneficial for abomasal healt...|$|R
40|$|Background: Early oral feeding {{after surgery}} is best {{practice}} among adult, noncritically ill patients. Evidenced-based guidelines (EBG) recommend commencing liquid and <b>solid</b> <b>feeding</b> within 24 h of surgery to improve patient (e. g. reduced morbidity) and hospital (e. g. reduced length of stay) outcomes. Whether these EBG are adhered to in usual clinical practice remains unknown. The present study aimed {{to identify the}} time to commencement of first oral <b>feed</b> (liquid or <b>solid)</b> and first <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> among postoperative, noncritically ill, adult patients. Methods: MEDLINE, CINAHL, SCOPUS and Web of Science databases were searched from inception to June 2016 for observational studies reporting liquid and/or <b>solid</b> <b>feeding</b> practices among postoperative patients. Studies reporting a mean/median time to first <b>feed</b> or first <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> within 24 h of surgery or where ≥ 75 % of patients were feeding by postoperative day one were considered in-line with EBG. Results: Of 5826 articles retrieved, 29 studies were included. Only 40 % and 22 % of studies reported time to first feed and time to first <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> in-line with EBG, respectively. Clear and free liquids were the first diet types commenced in 86 % of studies. When solids were commenced, 44 % of studies reported using various therapeutic diet types (e. g. light) prior to the commencement of a regular diet. Patients who underwent gastrointestinal procedures appeared {{more likely to experience}} delayed postoperative feeding. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate a gap between postoperative feeding evidence and its practical application. This information provides a strong rationale for interventions targeting improved nutritional care following surgery. Griffith Health, School of Nursing and MidwiferyFull Tex...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{involved}} {{a longitudinal study}} of 30 healthy infants from 6 weeks to 15 months to investigate the relationship between feeding behaviour and weight gain in infancy. Poor infant weight gain is associated with adverse outcomes in childhood (e. g. Skuse, Pickles, Wolke, et al 1994) and adulthood (e. g. Fall, Vijayakumar, Barker, et al 1995). Previous research has investigated the relationship between feeding behaviour and concurrent weight, but {{with a few exceptions}} there has been little previous work on the relationship between feeding behaviour and weight gain in infants. Feeding behaviour was measured at four breastfeeds in 32 infants at six weeks and later in 30 of the same infants at 12 months during <b>solids</b> <b>feeding.</b> Birthweight was obtained from parents' child health records and weight was measured at 6 weeks, 3 months and thereafter every 3 months until 15 months. Sucking patterns during milk feeding were found to be independently associated with infant weight gain, but there was no independent association between <b>solids</b> <b>feeding</b> behaviour and weight gain. Other independent predictors of weight gain were; infant sex, milk intake during breastfeeding and age of introduction of solids. An analysis of associations between milk and <b>solids</b> <b>feeding</b> behaviour found some evidence of parallels within infants across the two different types of feeding and the implications of this are discussed. A new method for the analysis of breastfed infants' sucking patterns which resolves the serious problems of the already published methods was developed during die course of the study and an outline of this is provided. Previously unavailable data on (1) the behaviour of one year olds during <b>solids</b> <b>feeding</b> and (2) the components of variation in milk and <b>solids</b> <b>feeding</b> behaviour are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Enterotoxemia is {{characterized}} by a highly fatal hemorrhagic enteritis in cattle, caused by Clostridium perfringens. Production systems with intensive feeding, such as the veal industry, are predisposed. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> provision on fecal C. perfringens excretion in veal calves. Ten Holstein Friesian bull veal calves were randomly assigned to one of two test diets. Group I received solemnly milk replacer twice daily, while group 2 received milk replacer and a maximum of 300 g solid feed/day, consisting of a mixture of 30 % barley, 30 % corn, 30 % hulled wheat and 10 % chopped straw. The number of C. perfringens per g feces or fecal clostridia! counts (FCC) were determined for all calves. Mean FCC were significantly lower in the calves fed milk replacer and <b>solid</b> <b>feed,</b> than in the calves fed solemnly milk replacer. Although the correlation between FCC and enterotoxemia risk remains to be determined, the provision of <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> to veal calves reduced clostridial excretion, which might contribute to the prevention of this disease...|$|R

40|$|Veal calves in Europe are {{typically}} fed {{large quantities of}} milk replacer and small amounts of <b>solid</b> <b>feed,</b> a diet known {{to lead to the}} development of abnormal oral behaviours in these animals. These abnormal oral behaviours are thought to be an indication of frustration, chronic stress, and hence poor welfare. The present study investigated how different feeding strategies, differing in <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> and milk replacer provision, affected the behaviour and welfare of veal calves across time. Four treatment groups (A–D) comprising of 12 Holstein–Friesian bull calves each (7. 6 ± 0. 1 weeks old and 54. 7 ± 0. 3 kg at arrival), penned in groups of three, were fed one of four amounts of a <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> mixture, i. e. 50 % concentrates, 25 % fresh maize silage, and 25 % wheat straw (on dry matter [DM] basis) : A = 0, B = 9, C = 18, and D = 27 g DM/kg 0. 75 /d. Provision of milk replacer was adjusted to achieve similar average daily gain across treatments. Behaviour was recorded around feeding (10 min continuous focal observations of individual calves) and throughout the day (7 sessions of 30 min scan sampling at 5 min interval every 2 h from 06 : 30 h) every week for four months. In an attempt to find an easy practical method to measure behavioural response to feeding strategy, two 3 -min behavioural tests were carried out: (1) in months 1 and 3, calves were presented with a ball and latency to make oral contact with it was recorded; and (2) in month 1, calves were presented with an overall and time spent orally manipulating (i. e. chewing or licking) it was recorded using scan sampling every 10 s. Calves in treatment D displayed less abnormal oral behaviours around feeding, less tongue playing throughout the day, and more chewing in the first two months, compared to treatment A. Treatment B only led to lower tongue playing levels compared to A and treatment C had no benefit in terms of reducing abnormal oral behaviours. Although a <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> dose–response was expected on the display of abnormal behaviours in veal calves, treatment C did not fit within this expectation. These findings point to a more complex relationship between <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> and abnormal oral behaviour frequency in veal calves. The two behavioural tests distinguished the different treatments as expected, and thus showed a <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> dose–response. Because of an increase in chewing and ruminating efficiency over time, amounts of <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> should be increased with age to maintain high levels of chewing and ruminating. Moreover, high levels of chewing and ruminating may have to be maintained long enough {{at the beginning of the}} fattening period to lead to a reduction in abnormal oral behaviour...|$|R

Three groups of 46 Polish Friesian calves, balanced according to initial BW, {{were assigned to the}} three dietary treatments in a fattening trial, which lasted 160 d. The provision of either <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> did not affect the milk replacer intake. However, calves' ADG was increased (P < 0. 01) only by feeding the beet pulp diet. The administration of both <b>solid</b> <b>feeds</b> improved calves' health status; calves fed <b>solid</b> <b>feeds</b> required fewer iron treatments for low hemoglobin and needed less medical treatments for respiratory or gastrointestinal diseases. In comparison to the Control calves, the provision of wheat straw and beet pulp increased iron intake throughout the fattening period by 41 and 130 %, respectively. However, only calves fed beet pulp showed higher levels of hemoglobin and plasma iron concentrations (P < 0. 05), whereas the same blood parameters were similar between Control calves and those fed wheat straw. At slaughter, both <b>solid</b> <b>feeds</b> led to empty forestomach weights heavier than those of Controls without reducing dressing percentage. The reticulorumen was heaviest in calves fed beet pulp, whereas wheat straw promoted omasal development. The administration of beet pulp resulted in a better carcass conformation than did the Control diet or wheat straw, but it had a detrimental effect on carcass color, which was graded as the darkest (P < 0. 001). Consistent with this result, meat color of calves fed beet pulp was darker than that of Control calves and those fed wheat straw, because of the higher hematin concentration measured at the muscle level. No differences in carcass and meat color were observed between Control calves and calves fed wheat straw. The administration of <b>solid</b> <b>feeds</b> for welfare purposes does not always prevent the production of veal meat fulfilling the color standards required by the market. There is not a straight-forward relationship between a <b>solid</b> <b>feed's</b> iron content and the "redness" of veal meat, which should be related to the capability of the calves to use the iron provided by the roughage...|$|R
40|$|Two {{different}} feeding {{plans for}} veal calves were compared in the study: a traditional liquid diet supplemented with 250   g/calf/d of barley grain or with 250 g/calf/d of ground wheat straw. The two <b>solid</b> <b>feeds</b> had different chemical composi-   tion but a similar particle size obtained by grinding the straw in a mill with an 8 -mm mesh screen. Twenty-four Polish   Friesian male calves {{were used in}} the study and they were housed in individual wooden stalls (0. 83 x 1. 80 m). The health   status of all the calves was satisfactory for the entire fattening period and no specific medical treatment was required   during the trial.

Feeding behaviour was affected by the provision of <b>solid</b> <b>feeds.</b> Eating and chewing were prolonged   in calves receiving ground wheat straw and the same <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> reduced the frequency of oral stereotypies at the end of   the fattening period.

The incidence of abomasal erosions, ulcers and scars was similar in both treatments; however the index   of abomasal damage, which considers the number and the seriousness of different type of lesions, was higher in calves   receiving barley grain. Therefore, the grinding of straw particles, as opposed to barley grain, can reduce the abrasive-   ness of roughage at the abomasum level.

40|$|Aims: To {{compare the}} {{susceptibility}} to parasitism by Ostertagia circumcincta of lambs fed entirely with bovine milk or weaned on to <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> at 3 weeks of age. In addition, {{the effect of}} a single daily feed of milk on worm burdens was assessed. Methods: Eight lambs were assigned to each of the 3 diets: milk (M), milk plus <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> (cereal-based pellets and lucerne chaff) (MS), or <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> only (S). Those to be fed <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> were converted from complete milk feeding to the designated diet during their third week of life. From 3 weeks of age, all lambs were infected with 1000 O. circumcincta larvae twice weekly for 6 weeks; 4 lambs from each diet group were given normal sheathed L 3 and another 4 were infected with exsheathed larvae. Faecal egg counts (FEC) and serum gastrin and pepsinogen concentrations were monitored from Day 17 after first infection, and worm burdens and abomasal pH and morphology were determined at necropsy. Results: Total worm burdens and FEC were significantly lower in the M than MS and S groups, whereas {{there was no significant difference}} between those receiving sheathed and exsheathed larvae. The milk-fed lambs had a smaller reticulo-rumen and omasum and a more acidic abomasal pH. Serum gastrin and pepsinogen were increased in all groups, irrespective of diet or type of larvae used for infection. Conclusions: The cause of the lower worm establishment in lambs fed only milk was probably not failure to exsheath in the immature gastro-intestinal tract, as there were similar worm burdens in lambs whether sheathed or exsheathed larvae were administered. The lower pH of the abomasal contents of the preruminant lambs may have been a factor, as the parasites have previously been shown to die more rapidly in vitro at low pH. Alternatively, the milk itself had adverse effects on the parasites, but was ineffective when combined with <b>solid</b> <b>feed.</b> There was no benefit from feeding a milk plus solid diet over a solid diet...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to know the effect of {{different}} <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> and milk intake during suckling on performance around weaning and on caecal content characteristics at weaning. In order to obtain different intakes of milk and <b>solid</b> <b>feed,</b> 13 litters of pregnant females (PF) inseminated the day after delivery and 14 litters of non-pregnant females (NPF) were compared. At birth the litters were equalized at eight pups and during lactation dead pups were replaced by pups of the same age from nursing does. Compared to the PF group, rabbits in the NPF group had a higher milk intake (26. 0 versus 21. 4 g/day; P < 0. 01) and lower <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> intake (9. 1 versus 11. 5 g/day; P < 0. 01) between 20 and 28 days of age. No significant difference was observed between the two groups in weight gain before and post-weaning (28 - 49 days). At weaning, the rabbits in group PF showed higher values in caecal content (g 26. 3 versus 22. 6; P < 0. 05) and volatile fatty acids (mmol/l 52. 2 versus 43. 6; P < 0. 01) and lower values in empty caecal weight (g 7. 18 versus 7. 78; P < 0. 05), C 3 (6. 4 versus 9. 3 %; P < 0. 01) and C 3 /C 4 ratio (0. 39 versus 0. 63; P < 0. 01) than the group NPF.

40|$|Diets fed to {{veal calves}} seem {{to lead to}} {{frustration}} and chronic stress in the calves, due to the limited opportunity to chew and ruminate on <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> (e. g. Veissier et al., 1998). Veal calves are typically fed only twice a day, and their meals comprise of large quantities of milk replacer supplemented by <b>solid</b> <b>feed,</b> with little structure to chew on (e. g. Brscic et al., 2011). The inability to perform highly-motivated natural behaviours, such as rumination in cattle, leads {{to the development of}} repetitive, invariant behaviours with no obvious function, termed stereotypies (e. g.

Tongue playing is thought to reflect a frustrated drive to eat and ruminate (e. g. Webb et al., 2012), but research also suggests that this behaviour is related to how milk is fed: in an open bucket or via a teat (Seo et al., 1998), and may, thus, reflect a frustrated drive to suck on a teat.

Calves received the same milk-replacer but the daily amount was restricted (96 %) for CGSES calves to balance dietary protein. Total dry matter intake from milk-replacer and <b>solid</b> <b>feeds</b> was similar among treatments, but CGSES calves showed better growth performance than CG ones. Calves were introduced into a metabolism stall (1 /pen) during week 9 of fattening for a 3 - day adaptation period and a 4 -day digestibility trial. Calves fed CG showed the greatest DM, NFC, and ash digestibility while CGSES calves showed the lowest CP digestibility. Haemoglobin concentrations measured at day 5, 31 and 80 were similar among feeding treatments and significantly decreased over time. In CGSES treatment, the combination of milkreplacer with <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> closer to a complete diet for ruminants led to better calves’ growth performance. However, the reduced protein digestibility with CGSES indicates that protein quality becomes a key factor when formulating diets for veal calves using alternatives to dairy sources...|$|R

40|$|This study {{utilized}} {{data from}} a prospective birth cohort study on 568 Indian children, {{to determine whether a}} longer duration of breastfeeding and later introduction of <b>solid</b> <b>feeding</b> were associated with a reduced higher body mass index (BMI) and less adiposity. Main outcomes were high BMI (> 90 th within-cohort sex-specific BMI percentile) and sum of skinfold thickness (triceps and subscapular) at age 5. Main exposures were breastfeeding (six categories from 1 – 4 to ? 21 months) and age of starting regular <b>solid</b> <b>feeding</b> (four categories from ? 3 to ? 6 months). Data on infant-feeding practices, socio-economic and maternal factors were collected by questionnaire. Birthweight, maternal and child anthropometry were measured. Multiple regression analysis that accounted for potential confounders demonstrated a small magnitude of effect for breastfeeding duration or introduction of <b>solid</b> <b>feeds</b> on the risk of high BMI but not for lower skinfold thickness. Breastfeeding duration was strongly negatively associated with weight gain (0 – 2 years) [adjusted ? = – 0. 12 standard deviation, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : – 0. 19 to – 0. 05 per category change in breastfeeding duration, P = 0. 001], and weight gain (0 – 2 years) was strongly associated with high BMI at 5 years (adjusted odds ratio = 3. 8, 95 % CI: 2. 53 – 5. 56, P < 0. 001). In our sample, findings suggest that longer breastfeeding duration and later introduction of solids has a small reduction on later high BMI risk and a negligible effect on skinfold thickness. However, accounting for sampling variability, these findings cannot exclude the possibility of no effect at the population level...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} quixalud on food preference and resistance from degradation. Quixalud was choosen because of its antimicrobial properties {{but it is not}} an antibiotic. The aim of this research is to evaluate the effect of quixalud addition on food preference by tiger shrimp and its resistant from degradation. The experiment was designed using Factorial with two treatments: quixalud concentration and soaking period. We used three concentration of quixalud: 30 ppm 60 ppm and 90 ppm. Each concentration were soaked at difference period of time, which were: 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours. Food preference and resistance from degradation were monitored. Results indicated that there was no different of shrimp food preference between quixalud feed and controls or feed without quixalud. However, there was a tendency that shrimp preferred feed with 60 ppm of quixalud. Quixalud has no effect on the remaining <b>solid</b> <b>feed.</b> It seem likely that the remaining <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> is mainly affected by the strength of binder rather than the presence of an antibacterial compound, such as quixalud.

40|$|AbstractThe {{performance}} of flash furnace burners can be evaluated {{quickly and efficiently}} using CFD modelling. Gas flows are modelled using the conventional Eulerian approach, while Lagrangian particle tracking is used to model the flow of <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> through the burner and into the reaction shaft. A composite particle model has been developed that considers the <b>solid</b> <b>feed</b> to {{be made up of}} single particles containing appropriate quantities of concentrate, flux and dust. Solid fuels (such as coal) can also be included in the composite particle. Reactions between the solids and gas are then modelled using standard heat and mass transfer relationships. Results from the modelling process are shown for BHP-Billiton’s Olympic Dam copper flash smelter with the burner that was used from 1998 – 2003. Flow patterns, temperature and gas composition distributions, particle dispersion and residence time, and overall extent of sulphur removal are predicted and used to evaluate furnace performance. However, results are sensitive to the assumed size of the composite particles, and plant measurements are required to determine the appropriate composite particle size to predict quantitative data...|$|R
