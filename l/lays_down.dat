5|$|Sacred groves {{exist in}} China, India, Africa and elsewhere. They {{are places where}} the deities live and where all the living things are either sacred or are companions of the gods. Folklore <b>lays</b> <b>down</b> the supernatural {{penalties}} that will result if desecration takes place for example by the felling of trees. Because of their protected status, sacred groves {{may be the only}} relicts of ancient forest and have a biodiversity much greater than the surrounding area.|$|E
5|$|Ally then sings as {{she lays}} in the sand, moving sensually as an {{attractive}} man {{comes out of}} the water towards her. The camera fades to Lauren, who sings the bridge as she stands next to a background of rocks, as a take of another man is shown. The group is then scattered in different spots standing in a large rock formation, where shots of Dinah alone are spliced as she sings the chorus. Normani shares the chorus, as she sings on top of the rock cliff, shown earlier in the video. Camila seductively <b>lays</b> <b>down</b> and grabs her hair, in similarity to Ally. Several men approach the girls as they arrive in a convertible Jeep Wrangler. They greet and socialize with each other.|$|E

5|$|The Municipal Commissioner is {{the chief}} Executive Officer {{and head of the}} {{executive}} arm of the Municipal Corporation. All executive powers are vested in the Municipal Commissioner who is an Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer appointed by the state government. Although the Municipal Corporation is the legislative body that <b>lays</b> <b>down</b> policies for the governance of the city, it is the Commissioner who is responsible for the execution of the policies. The Commissioner is appointed for a fixed term as defined by state statute. The powers of the Commissioner are those provided by statute and those delegated by the Corporation or the Standing Committee.|$|E
5|$|The case of Ellis v. Dubowski (1921) <b>lays</b> <b>down</b> the {{principle}} {{that there can be}} no delegation of authority to an absolute body from which no right of appeal exists. In this case, a licensing committee exercising statutory powers to license cinemas to be used for film screenings had imposed a condition in a licence that films had to be certified by the British Board of Film Censors before they could be shown. This was found to be ultra vires because the Board should not be made the final dictator. Furthermore, the fact that the Board had been given absolute power to prohibit films for reasons which might be private or influenced by trade considerations was sufficient to render the condition ultra vires.|$|E
5|$|Equality {{in matters}} of public employment: Article 16 of the {{constitution}} <b>lays</b> <b>down</b> that the State cannot discriminate against anyone in the matters of employment. All citizens can apply for government jobs. There are some exceptions. The Parliament may enact a law stating that certain jobs can be filled only by applicants who are domiciled in the area. This may be meant for posts that require knowledge of the locality and language of the area. The State may also reserve posts for members of backward classes, scheduled castes or scheduled tribes which are not adequately represented in the services under the State {{to bring up the}} weaker sections of the society. Also, there a law may be passed that requires that the holder of an office of any religious institution shall also be a person professing that particular religion. According to the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2003, this right shall not be conferred to Overseas citizens of India.|$|E

5|$|The Right against Exploitation, {{contained}} in Articles 23â€“24, <b>lays</b> <b>down</b> certain provisions to prevent {{exploitation of the}} weaker sections of the society by individuals or the State. Article 23 prohibits human trafficking, making it an offence punishable by law, and also prohibits forced labour or any act of compelling a person to work without wages where he was legally entitled not to work or to receive remuneration for it. However, it permits the State to impose compulsory service for public purposes, including conscription and community service. The Bonded Labour system (Abolition) Act, 1976, has been enacted by Parliament {{to give effect to}} this Article. Article 24 prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14 years in factories, mines and other hazardous jobs. Parliament has enacted the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986, providing regulations for the abolition of, and penalties for employing, child labour, as well as provisions for rehabilitation of former child labourers.|$|E
5|$|McKay initiates an anti-Replicator {{field to}} protect them from the Asurans, but Oberoth (David Ogden Stiers) discovers this and sends a wave to {{override}} the field. Weir leaves McKay, confronts Oberoth and uses his power to freeze all the Asurans, even tricking him into believing that he has captured the team, all to buy Sheppard enough time to upload the programme. However, Weir struggles to keep Asurans frozen, and when Sheppard finds her just as she loses control, she orders him to leave her behind as the Asurans unfreeze and capture her. The team escapes without Weir, but end up trapped as they lack the power to make it to hyperspace. They are unexpectedly assisted by the Apollo, who have found Atlantis with Colonel Carter's (Amanda Tapping) help. The Apollo <b>lays</b> <b>down</b> covering fire long enough for the team to land in the fighter bay and carries them back to Atlantis. However, the Apollo is unable to lock onto Doctor Weir and beam her aboard. Now fully powered, Sheppard sends the city to M35-117, a back-up planet, and makes a rough landing onto its ocean. Whilst the team mourns the loss of Weir, McKay regains contact with Stargate Command. Dr. Zelenka (David Nykl) announces that the Asurans have begun their attack against the Wraith, meaning Weir's sacrifice was not in vain. Carter tells Sheppard that they will miss Weir, though Sheppard vows to find her again.|$|E
