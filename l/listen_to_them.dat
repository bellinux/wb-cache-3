Marley tells Scrooge that he has one chance to avoid the same fate: he will be visited by three spirits and he must <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> or be cursed to carry chains of his own, much longer than Marley's chains.|$|E
5|$|On July 29 the 1st Battalion {{suffered}} {{about 60}} casualties from North Korean mortar fire. As {{the men were}} preparing their perimeter defense for the night, a general panic arose, {{for reasons that are}} still unclear. Most of them deserted their positions in a state of alarm. Colonel White found himself, the 77th Combat Engineer Company, and a battery of the 159th Field Artillery Battalion all that was left in the front line. He had to personally reorganize the battalion as many of his officers were unable to get the men to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> As White tried to rally his men, the field artillery maintained a sustained barrage of fire to slow the North Koreans advance. That night alone the artillery fired 3,000 rounds in holding back the North Koreans.|$|E
5|$|The {{only reason}} the Nazis put on {{prisoner}} broadcasts {{is to get}} people justifiably anxious about relatives reported missing at the front {{to listen to their}} propaganda. Although many of the messages undoubtedly are true, they represent but a small fraction of our prisoners and we have no assurance that many of them are not faked from papers picked up on the battlefield. What concerns some of us is the consequences of listening to Nazi broadcasts unless you are a well-trained listener (and often, even if you are). Nazi arguments often sound plausible. A person may <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> with all the skepticism in the world, knowing that every word is a lie. But if the content is sufficiently sensational (and it often is) the source may be forgotten in time, and out pops the Nazi lie, all unsuspecting.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{discovery}} in 1963 that eastern wolves answered human imitations of their howls, Algonquin Provincial Park began its Public Wolf Howls attraction, where {{as many as}} 2,500 visitors are led on expeditions into areas where eastern wolves were sighted {{the night before and}} <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> answering the Park staff's imitation howls. By 2000, 85 Public Wolf Howls had been held, with over 110,000 people having participated. The Park considers the attraction as the cornerstone of its wolf education program, and credits it with changing public attitudes towards wolves in Ontario.|$|E
25|$|The grand-ducal {{government}} of the Seekreis was dissolved, and Hecker gradually gained reinforcements. But friendly advisers also joined him, pointing out the risks of his undertaking. Hecker, however, {{was not at all}} ready to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> On the contrary, he added to violence an absurd defiance, and offered an amnesty to the German princes on condition of their retiring within fourteen days into private life. The troops of Baden and Hesse marched against him, under the command of General Friedrich von Gagern, and on April 20 they met near Kandern, where, although Gagern was killed, Hecker was completely defeated.|$|E
25|$|Xun Xu {{was careful}} and {{cautious}} in his behaviour. Whenever policy changes were announced, if {{he played a}} role in lobbying for those changes, he would keep quiet about his involvement. Xun Liang (荀良), one of his younger relatives, advised him to let others know the good deeds he did so that he would gain greater respect. Wu Tong (武統), his son-in-law, also urged him to attract people to support him. However, Xun Xu refused to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> and he warned his sons against forming their own political clouts and forgetting their place as subjects of the emperor. Later, Emperor Wu promoted Xun Xu to be the Prefect of the Masters of Writing (尚書令).|$|E

25|$|There was {{a transit}} of the Earth and Moon across the Sun {{as seen from}} Saturn/Titan just hours before the landing. Huygens entered the upper layer of Titan's {{atmosphere}} 2.7 hours {{after the end of}} the transit of the Earth, or only one or two minutes {{after the end of the}} transit of the Moon. However, the transit did not interfere with the Cassini orbiter or Huygens probe, for two reasons. First, although they could not receive any signal from Earth because it was in front of the Sun, Earth could still <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> Second, Huygens did not send any readable data to the Earth; it transmitted data to the Cassini orbiter, which relayed the data received to the Earth later.|$|E
25|$|The rebels {{realized}} {{that the people in}} Mecca supported the defense offered by Uthman and were not in the mood to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> That was a great psychological victory for Uthman. It is said, according to Sunni Muslim accounts, that before returning to Syria, the governor Muawiyah, Uthman’s cousin, suggested that Uthman should come with him to Syria as the atmosphere there was peaceful. Uthman rejected his offer, saying that he didn't want to leave the city of Muhammad (referring to Medina). Muawiyah then suggested that he be allowed to send a strong force from Syria to Medina to guard Uthman against any possible attempt by rebels to harm him. Uthman rejected it too, saying that the Syrian forces in Medina would be an incitement to civil war, and he could not be party to such a move.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} few years TWiT episodes were made {{available}} in a variety of file formats for individual download or RSS subscription. These included a standard 64kbit/s MP3, a low-bandwidth 16kbit/s MP3, Advanced Audio Coding (AAC), and open source Ogg Vorbis. However, the Ogg Vorbis version of the show ceased to be offered in August 2009 with the AAC and low bandwidth MP3 versions ending in early November 2009. In response, Leo Laporte stated that he was a believer that his content should be made available to the widest audience possible in the format of their choice, as well as philosophically agreeing with the open source nature of Ogg Vorbis. However the time and effort the TWiT Staff needed to encode, upload, and distribute alternate audio formats in the limited time between recording and release each Sunday evening was not justified by the number of people choosing to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

Hollyleaf, Lionblaze, Jayfeather, and Squirrelflight are worried {{that he is going}} to {{publicly}} announce their secret. Between then and the day of the Gathering, the three warn Ashfur that he will regret it if he reveals the secret. Although he is frightened, he refuses to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> Right before the Gathering, the patrol of warriors going notices that both Ashfur and Squirrelflight are missing. On the way to the Gathering, they see Ashfur's body lying in the WindClan stream as if he had drowned. They take him back to camp and set him for vigil. Leafpool notices a slit in his neck, suggesting he was murdered. After the Gathering, Firestar announces that Ashfur's death was unknown and suspects a cat from ThunderClan may have killed him, and the three see Squirrelflight looking scared and holding her breath. The three vow to keep the recent events involving them, Squirrelflight, and Ashfur a secret.|$|E
25|$|WhatsApp {{was founded}} by Jan Koum and Brian Acton.WhatsApp joined Facebook in 2014, but {{continues}} to operate as a separate app with a laser focus on building a messaging service that works fast and reliably anywhere in the world.WhatsApp started {{as an alternative to}} SMS. Whatsapp now supports sending and receiving a variety of media including text, photos, videos, documents, and location, as well as voice calls. Whatsapp messages and calls are secured with end-to-end encryption, meaning that no third party including WhatsApp can read or <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> Whatsapp has a customer base of 1 billion people in over 180 countries. It is used to send personalised promotional messages to individual customers. It has plenty of advantages over SMS that includes ability to track how Message Broadcast Performs using blue tick option in Whatsapp. It allows sending messages to Do Not Disturb(DND) customers. Whatsapp is also used to send a series of bulk messages to their targeted customers using broadcast option. Companies started using this to a large extent because it is a cost effective promotional option and quick to spread a message. Still, Whatsapp doesn't allow businesses to place ads in their app.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, Martin {{launched}} his weekly NBC comedy-variety series, The Dean Martin Show, which ran for 264 episodes until 1974. He won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Television Series Musical or Comedy in 1966 and was nominated again {{the following three}} years. The show exploited his image as a carefree boozer. Martin capitalized on his laid-back persona of the half-drunk crooner, hitting on women with remarks that would get anyone else slapped, and making snappy if slurred remarks about fellow celebrities during his roasts. During an interview on the British TV documentary Wine, Women and Song, aired in 1983, he stated, perhaps tongue-in-cheek, that he had someone record them on cassette tape so he could <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> His TV show was a success. The show's loose format featured quick-witted improvisation from Martin and his weekly guests. This prompted a battle between Martin and NBC censors, who insisted on more scrutiny of the content. The show was often in the Top Ten. Martin, appreciative of the show's producer, his friend Greg Garrison, made a handshake deal giving Garrison, a pioneer TV producer in the 1950s, 50% of the show. However, the validity of that ownership {{is the subject of}} a lawsuit brought by NBCUniversal.|$|E

In an interview soon after the game's release, Scull said [...] "Some of [...] tracks are so good, I actually <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> alongside my usual eclectic mix." [...] Mysteries of Westgate's voice acting was recorded in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, with over 12,000 words of new voice-over material.

500|$|During {{his first}} few years on the team, Giants fans were merciless in their {{treatment}} of Simms, who they felt was a disappointment. He commented that his wife [...] "had to sit up in the stands and <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> cuss me." [...] However, in 1984, after many seasons plagued by injuries and up-and-down play, Simms finally emerged as a team offensive leader. During his 1983 injury, offensive coordinator Ron Erhardt talked Simms into watching more game film, something he had not regularly done in college or the pros. He gained {{a better understanding of}} NFL defenses, his team's formations, and pass protection schemes, and improved his ability to audible at the line of scrimmage. He also changed his strength training regimen in an attempt to make his body more resistant to injury. He passed for 4,044yards (second most in the National Football Conference (NFC), 22 touchdown passes, and led the Giants to a playoff berth.|$|E
500|$|Molotov, like Stalin, was pathologically mistrustful of others, {{and because}} of it, much crucial {{information}} disappeared. As Molotov once said [...] "One should <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> but {{it is necessary to}} check up on them. The intelligence officer can lead you to a very dangerous position... There are many provocateurs here, there, and everywhere." [...] Molotov continued to claim, in a series of published interviews, that there never was a secret territorial deal between Stalin and Hitler during the Nazi-Soviet Pact. Like Stalin, he never recognised the Cold War as an international event. He saw the Cold War as, more or less, the everyday conflict between communism and capitalism. He divided the capitalist countries into two groups, the [...] "smart and dangerous imperialists" [...] and the [...] "fools". Before his retirement, Molotov proposed establishing a socialist confederation with the People's Republic of China (PRC); Molotov believed socialist states were part of a bigger, supranational entity. In retirement, Molotov criticised Nikita Khrushchev for being a [...] "right-wing deviationist".|$|E

[...] Baradwaj Rangan, writing for The Hindu, said, [...] "Listen to the lazy drawl with which certain words taper off in ‘Avalukkenna,’ an antidote to the rock ‘n’ roll bounce {{in the rest of the}} song."

500|$|In the Boxing Day {{match against}} Everton, Baroš was {{involved}} thoroughly in the proceedings. He opened the scoring in the 35th minute, having handled the ball immediately beforehand. This was not punished and the referee awarded a goal. Baroš subsequently celebrated {{in front of}} the travelling Everton fans, making a gesture as if to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> A number of missiles from the crowd were subsequently thrown in Baroš' direction. The goal was just his third in what Glenn Moore of The Independent described as [...] "an indifferent season" [...] for Baroš. He went on to score his second goal of the game, and Villa's fourth, earning him man of the match honours. Baroš scored twice in January 2006's fourth round FA Cup win against Port Vale, and added another in the following round's 1–1 draw with Manchester City. Late in the season, he scored two goals in the Second City derby against Birmingham City at Villa Park, marking his 11th and 12th goals of the season and winning another man of the match award. He would score no further goals that season.|$|E
500|$|In {{the post-war}} period Poulenc crossed swords with composers {{of the younger}} {{generation}} who rejected Stravinsky's recent work and insisted that only the precepts of the Second Viennese School were valid. Poulenc defended Stravinsky and expressed incredulity that [...] "in 1945 we are speaking as if the aesthetic of twelve tones is the only possible salvation for contemporary music". His view that Berg had taken serialism as far as it could go and that Schoenberg's music was now [...] "desert, stone soup, ersatz music, or poetic vitamins" [...] earned him the enmity of composers such as Pierre Boulez. Those disagreeing with Poulenc attempted to paint him as a relic of the pre-war era, frivolous and unprogressive. This led him to focus on his more serious works, and to try to persuade the French public to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> In the US and Britain, with their strong choral traditions, his religious music was frequently performed, but performances in France were much rarer, so that the public and the critics were often unaware of his serious compositions.|$|E
