Previous studies have incessantly found direct {{positive effects of}} antisocial behaviour and athleticism to peer-perceived popularity. This longitudinal study examines the main effects of antisocial behaviour and athleticism in popularity and whether these variables are mutually reinforcing. Furthermore, we examined if gender made a difference within the association of athleticism and popularity. The analyses are done on data of the SNARE project including 1209 Dutch adolescents (11 - 15 year) (Social Network Analysis of Risk behavior in adolescence Early). Antisocial behaviour is measured by self-report; athleticism and perceived popularity are measured by peer nominations. Results from the multiple linear regression analysis demonstrate no interaction-effect between antisocial behaviour and athleticism on peer-perceived popularity at a cross-sectional and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>level.</b> This implies that antisocial adolescents who seem sporty aren’t more popular amongst peers. At a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>level</b> only the increase of athleticism and previous popularity increases perceived popularity. Furthermore, boys are as popular as girls.

The study was done using two types of trucks: small local trucks for local metropolitan distribution areas and larger tractor-trailers for cross-country transportation. Ten metropolitan areas in different regions of Brazil were selected for 1 -day trips representing normal delivery. These trips encountered varying road surfaces (asphalt, concrete, stone and dirt). The long distance trips were done on highways that were more than 1200 km long. The vertical vibration levels were higher than the lateral and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>levels</b> as expected.

40|$|Adiponectin is an adipocyte-specific {{cytokine}} {{that has}} a protective {{role in the development}} of cardiovascular morbidities. As chronic kidney disease progresses, adiponectin levels increase and cardiovascular risk profiles change. Here we determined the association of baseline and longitudinal changes in adiponectin with different cardiovascular outcomes in 1255 type 2 diabetic hemodialysis patients in the German Diabetes and Dialysis Study. Within 4 years of follow-up, the hazard ratios to reach pre-specified, adjudicated end points were determined. The increased risk of cardiovascular events observed with high adiponectin levels at baseline was associated with high risks of sudden death and stroke but not of myocardial infarction. Adiponectin was negatively correlated with C-reactive protein and positively correlated with NT-pro-BNP, the latter significantly attenuating the associations with adverse outcome. Increased <b>longitudinal</b> <b>levels</b> of adiponectin during follow-up were associated with higher risks of adverse cardiovascular outcomes and death; associations weakened by a confounding effect of increased NT-pro-BNP.

Studies focusing on the quantitative evaluation of impacts of spatial scales are, however, limited in fisheries. Using the Chinese squid-jigging fishery in the north-western Pacific Ocean as an example, we evaluated impacts of spatial scale used in grouping fisheries and environmental data on the standardisation of fisheries catch per unit effort (CPUE). We developed 18 scenarios of different spatial scales with a combination of three latitudinal levels (0. 5 ◦, 1 ◦ and 2 ◦) and six <b>longitudinal</b> <b>levels</b> (0. 5 ◦, 1 ◦, 2 ◦, 3 ◦, 4 ◦ and 5 ◦) to aggregate the data. We then applied generalised additive models to analyse the 18 scenarios of data for the CPUE standardisation, and quantified differences among the scenarios. This study shows that longitudinal and latitudinal spatial scale and size of the spatial area for data aggregation can greatly influence the standardisation of CPUE. We recommend that similar studies be undertaken whenever possible to evaluate the roles of spatial scales and to identify the optimal spatial scale for data aggregations in the standardisation of CPUE and fisheries stock assessment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Over its {{useful life}} a railway track {{is subject to}} many {{mechanical}} and environmental stresses which gradually lead to its deterioration. Monitoring the wear condition of the railway superstructure {{is one of the}} key points to guarantee an adequate safety level of the railway transport system; in this field, the use of high-efficiency laser techniques has become consolidated and implemented in diagnostic trains (e. g. the “Archimede train” and the “Talete train”) which allow to detect the track geometric parameters (gauge, alignment, <b>longitudinal</b> <b>level,</b> cross level, superelevation defect, etc.) and the state of rail wear (vertical, horizontal, 45 -degree etc.) with very high accuracy. The objective of this paper is to describe a new non-conventional procedure for detecting the transverse profile of worn-out rails by means of image-processing technique. This methodological approach is based on the analysis of the information contained in high-resolution photographic images of rails and on specific algorithms which allow to obtain the exact geometric profile and the measurement of the relevant deviations compared to new rails of the same typology. The analyses and the first results, obtained from laboratory researches, concern rails cross sections taken from railway lines under upgrading.

40|$|Individual and {{topographical}} {{variation in}} the metabolic profiles of multiple human gastrointestinal tract (GIT) biopsies have been characterized using high-resolution magic-angle spinning (HRMAS) 1 H NMR spectroscopy and pattern recognition. Samples from antrum, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and transverse colon were obtained from 8 male and 8 female participants. Each gut region generated a highly characteristic metabolic profile consistent with the varying structural and functional properties of the tissue at different <b>longitudinal</b> <b>levels</b> of the gut. The antral (stomach) mucosa contained higher levels of choline, glycogen, phosphorylethanolamine, and taurine than other gut regions. The spatially close regions of the duodenum and jejunum were equivalent {{in terms of their}} gross biochemical composition with high levels of choline, glutathione, glycerophosphocholine (GPC), and lipids relative to other gut regions. The ileal mucosa showed poor discrimination from the duodenum and jejunum tissues and generated strong amino acids signatures but had relative low GPC signals. The colon (large intestine) was high in acetate, glutamate, inositols, and lactate and low in creatine, GPC, and taurine compared to the small intestine. These longitudinal metabolic variations in the human GIT could be attributed to functional variations in energy metabolism, osmoregulation, gut microbial activity, and oxidative protection. This work indicates that 1 H HRMAS NMR studies may be of value in analyzing local metabolic variation due to pathological processes in gut biopsies...|$|R

Potential correlation between track parameters (e. g. <b>longitudinal</b> <b>level,</b> deflection and track stiffness), and defect positions as detected by ultrasonic testing of rails has been investigated.

30|$|The {{critical}} part of the railway infrastructure is the track; track failures potentially affect safety and may cause delays in the speed [35]. Thus, the main objective is to ensure the performance, safety, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of the track. The inspection methods used by Trafikverket to control track irregularities and note any displacement from the design are conducted by inspection trains. The STRIX/IMV 100 monitors the track using a contactless measurement system, based on an inertial measurement system and an optical system. The measurement {{is based on the}} standard EN 13848 - 2. Trafikverket track condition data are collected by the measurement wagon. The wagon goes along the track at speeds up to 200  km/h and measures each track section five to six times per year, depending on the section. Up to 35 track geometry parameters are obtained and stored for every 25  cm [35]. Different measurements and ways of measuring are available to assess the railway track components in direct physical contact with each other. For instance, the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>level</b> measurement is a vertical position of the right and left rails measured by a position sensor and accelerometer. The acceleration measure should be integrated vertically twice over time to determine the position of the wagon. The result is summed to identify the vertical position of each rail [11, 36].|$|E

This study aimed to respond to the research question: How do patients make sense of their experience of accessing psychosocial support through telehealth? Methods: A longitudinal multiple case study design was used to explore patient experiences of accessing support through telehealth. Three palliative care participants were provided with videoconferencing equipment to access support from their own homes. Semi structured interviews were conducted at monthly intervals over a period of three months. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was used to analyse the data.

We usedmagnetic resonance tagging to obtain information on LV deformation, rotation, and torsion from a series of tagged images in five evenly distributed, parallel, short-axis sections of the heart of nine controlsand eight persons with SIT without other structural (cardiac) defect.

The research method has been philosophical analysis with a synthetic approach. To achieve the research objectives, first, Sadra’s epistemological foundations from numerous works of Mulla Sadra {{and some of his}} exponents are analyzed, then educational elements based on that foundations are justified; Sadra’s fundamental epistemological foundations in two areas of ontology and epistemology include: 1) to become identical knowledge with being, 2) self-speech is the wholly of faculties, 3) the unity of the knower, known and the act of knowing, 4) priority of theoretical reason over practical one, 5) Establishment of the balance between the tangible and intelligible worlds, and 6) hierarchy of knowledge. Important educational elements i. e. objective, curriculum, teacher, student, and teaching methods have been analyzed with regard to the above-mentioned foundations and it has been indicated that the educational elements in this view have particular features and characteristics which can lead the learner to self-actualization and manifest rays of rationality i. e. faith in him. Educational perspective resulting from such a foundation emphasizes on the reality of education that in this case, education at the time of unity and preserving uniqueness like truth of being includes multiples such as strength and weaknesses, priority and posteriority, perfection and imperfection.

The {{long-term}} effects of work environment on the association between adult socioeconomic position and ill health among the elderly The {{aim of this study}} is to analyse the {{long-term effects}} of work environment on the association between adult socioeconomic position (SEP) and six ill health outcomes among the elderly. Data was drawn from the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>Level</b> of Living and the SWEOLD-surveys. The individuals are followed from 1968 to 1992 and from 1981 to 2002 and 2004, combining baseline information regarding SEP and work environment during the period of occupational activity with the ill health outcomes from the follow-up studies. Strongest effects where revealed when controlling for the physical work environment on the association between both measures of SEP and two of the ill health outcomes: musculoskeleta lpain and physical performance. The psychological work environment, however, explained very small parts of the associations. The results, even controlled for SEP, exposed strong direct relations between ill health and psychological work environment and rather strong relations to physical work environment. As socioeconomic position indicates a particular structural position within society it may determine the likelihood of health damaging exposures during the period of occupational activity. This study shows that the effect of work environment significantly affects ill health among the elderly. Hence, the results indicate the importance of taking measures in improving work environment during the labour-market participation period, especially since policy-makers attempt to convince workers to stay longer in the workforce.

40|$|Railway track {{stiffness}} (vertical track load {{divided by}} track deflection) {{is a basic}} parameter oftrack design which influences the bearing capacity, the dynamic behaviour of passing vehiclesand, in particular, track geometry quality {{and the life of}} track components. Track stiffness is abroad topic and in this thesis some aspects are treated comprehensively. In the introductionpart of the thesis, track stiffness and track stiffness measurements are put in their propercontext of track maintenance and condition assessment. The first aspect is measurement of track stiffness. During the course of this project, Banverkethas developed a new device for measurement of dynamic track stiffness called RSMV(Rolling Stiffness Measurement Vehicle). The RSMV is capable of exciting the trackdynamically through two oscillating masses above one wheelset. The dynamic stiffness is acomplex-valued quantity where magnitude is the direct relation between applied load anddeflection (kN/mm) and phase is a measure of deflection-delay by comparison with force. Thephase has partial relationship with damping properties and ground vibration. The RSMVrepeatability is convincing and both overall measurements at higher speeds (up to 50 km/h) and detailed investigations (below 10 km/h) can be performed. The measurement systemdevelopment is described in Paper A and B. The second aspect is evaluation of track stiffness measurements along the track from a trackengineering perspective. Actual values of stiffness as well as variations along the track areimportant, but cannot always answer maintenance and design related questions alone. InPaper D track stiffness is studied in combination with measurements of track geometryquality (<b>longitudinal</b> <b>level)</b> and ground penetrating radar (GPR). The different measurementsare complementary and a more reliable condition assessment is possible by the combinedanalysis. The relation between soft soils and dynamic track stiffness measurements is studiedin Paper C. Soft soils are easily found and quantified by stiffness measurements, in particularif the soft layer is in {{the upper part of the}} substructure. There are also possibilities to directlyrelate substructure properties to track stiffness measurements. Environmental vibrations areoften related to soft soils and partly covered in Paper C. One explanation of the excitationmechanism of train induced environmental vibrations is short waved irregular supportconditions. This is described in Paper E, where track stiffness was evinced to have normalvariations of 2 – 10 % between adjacent sleepers and variations up to 30 % were found. Anindicative way of finding irregular support conditions is by means of filtering longitudinallevel, which is also described in the paper. Train-track interaction simulation is used in PaperH to study track stiffness influence on track performance. Various parameters of trackperformance are considered, e. g. rail sectional moment, rail displacement, forces at wheel-railinterface and on sleepers, and vehicle accelerations. Determining optimal track stiffness froman engineering perspective is an important task as it impacts all listed parameters. The third aspect, efficient maintenance, is only partially covered. As track stiffness relates toother condition data when studied from a maintenance perspective, vertical geometricaldefects (<b>longitudinal</b> <b>level</b> and corrugation/roughness) are studied in paper F. The generalmagnitude dependency of wavelength is revealed and ways of handling this in conditionassessment are proposed. Also a methodology for automated analysis of a large set ofcondition data is proposed in Paper G. A case study where dynamic track stiffness,longitudinal level and ground penetrating radar are considered manifests the importance oftrack stiffness measurements, particularly for soil/embankment related issues.

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{confined}} swirling flow in a cyclone. The numerical simulations are performed using a proposed eddy viscosity turbulence model, {{which accounts for}} the effects of the streamline curvature and rotation. This distinguishes the current model from the conventional Eddy Viscosity Models (EVMs) that are known to fail to predict the Rankine vortex in swirling flows. Although computationally more expensive approaches, the Reynolds Stress Model (RSM) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES), have demonstrated a high capability of dealing with such flows, these techniques are often unsuited for use in complex design studies where computational speed and robustness are key factors. In the present approach, the Shear Stress Transport with Curvature Correction (SSTCC) turbulence model is modified by the introduction of the Richardson number to account for the rotation and curvature effects. The numerical predictions were validated using experimental results and also compared to the data obtained using the RSM model and various EVMs without the proposed modifications. The investigations started with a benchmark case of a flow through a channel duct with a U-turn, after which more challenging simulations of a high swirling flow within a cyclone separator device were performed. The results show that the proposed model is competitive in terms of accuracy when compared to RSM and proves to be superior to the RSM model in terms of computational cost. Furthermore, it is found that the proposed model preserves the ability to represent the Rankine vortex profile at different <b>longitudinal</b> <b>levels</b> of the cyclone. It is also more efficient in terms of the computational cost than the SSTCC model without the introduced modifications...|$|R

For the free rolling tail configuration, the canards provide conventional roll control with no roll control reversal at low angles of attack.
