50|$|The {{nematode}} Angiostrongylus cantonensis {{which causes}} rat <b>lungworm</b> <b>disease</b> {{may be very}} widespread in the United States. Beginning in 2017, Hawaii experienced an epidemic involving Eryngium foetidum that is infested with the semislug Parmarion martensi, which is the principal molluscan vector of the disease. The slime containing the stage 3 larvae can cause the disease and that the nematode larvae can remain viable in the slime {{for up to three}} weeks.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{investigation of}} <b>lungworm</b> <b>disease</b> outbreaks {{that is based}} on retrospective examination of cases recorded between 1994 and 2000 on a government beef cattle breeding centre in the state of Pahang, peninsular Malaysia. The breed of cattle on the centre was Nelore and the mean population over a 7 -year period (from 1994 to 2000) was 1612. All animals were allowed to graze on pasture and mixed grazing was practiced on the farm. The routine de-worming programme was performed using levamisole and ivermecti...|$|E
40|$|The {{nematode}} Angiostrongylus cantonensis is a rat lungworm, a zoonotic pathogen {{that causes}} human eosinophilic meningitis and ocular angiostrongyliasis characteristic of rat <b>lungworm</b> (RLW) <b>disease.</b> Definitive diagnosis {{is made by}} finding and identifying A. cantonensis larvae in the cerebral spinal fluid or by using a custom immunological or molecular test. This {{study was conducted to}} determine if genomic DNA from A. cantonensis is detectable by qPCR in the blood or tissues of experimentally infected rats. F 1 offspring from wild rats were subjected to experimental infection with RLW larvae isolated from slugs, then blood or tissue samples were collected over multiple time points. Blood samples were collected from 21 rats throughout the course of two trials (15 rats in Trial I, and 6 rats in Trial II). In addition to a control group, each trial had two treatment groups: the rats in the low dose (LD) group were infected by approximately 10 larvae and the rats in the high dose (HD) group were infected with approximately 50 larvae. In Trial I, parasite DNA was detected in cardiac bleed samples from five of five LD rats and five of five HD rats at six weeks post-infection (PI), and three of five LD rats and five of five HD rats from tail tissue. In Trial II, parasite DNA was detected in peripheral blood samples from one of two HD rats at 53 minutes PI, one of two LD rats at 1. 5 hours PI, one of two HD rats at 18 hours PI, one of two LD rats at five weeks PI and two of two at six weeks PI, and two of two HD rats at weeks five and six PI. These data demonstrate that parasite DNA can be detected in peripheral blood at various time points throughout RLW infection in rats...|$|R
40|$|Case Description - The {{owner of}} a herd of 74 Holstein-Friesian cattle {{reported}} decreased milk production, weight loss, and coughing among lactating cows. Owner-initiated antimicrobial treatment was unsuccessful; 1 lactating cow died, and 50 % of the lactating cows had clinical signs of respiratory distress, such as tachypnea and coughing. Clinical Findings - On the basis of history, physical examination findings, and fecal examination results, affected animals were determined to have Dictyocaulus viviparus (<b>lungworm)</b> infestation. The <b>disease</b> history suggested that the herd contained cows with subclinical patent lungworm infestations; after introduction of susceptible heifers, the pastures had become heavily infested with D viviparus and clinical problems subsequently developed in both newly introduced and resident cows. Treatment and Outcome - Affected and unaffected heifers and adult cows were treated with a pour-on formulation of eprinomectin (0. 5 mg/kg [0. 23 mg/lb]). One animal died, but 2 weeks after treatment, clinical signs among affected cattle were markedly improved. Ten weeks after treatment, milk production improved from 23 kg/cow/d (51 lb/cow/d) to 28 kg/cow/d (62 lb/cow/d). Clinical Relevance - The outbreak provides additional evidence that dictyocaulosis is becoming more common among adult dairy cattle, rather than almost exclusively affecting young stock. This may be attributable to anthelmintic use and management practices on dairy farms. Combined with anecdotal reports {{of an increase in}} the incidence of dictyocaulosis among adult cattle in North America, D viviparus infestation should be included as a differential diagnosis for decreased milk production, weight loss, and coughing among adult dairy cattle...|$|R

40|$|Metastrongylidosis or <b>lungworm</b> <b>disease</b> in swine is {{a disease}} caused by several types of {{nematodes}} of the genus Metastrongylus. Metastrongylidae are biohelminths whose causes use transitory hosts for their development and maintaining their biological cycle, {{and in this case}} they are numerous species of Lumbricidae (earthworms). Depending on the geographic environment, numerous representatives of Lumbricidae persist as transitory hosts. In our environment, these are dominant earthworm species of the genus Eisenia spp, Dandreobena spp, Allopbophora spp, Lubricus spp, Octoiasium spp, Bimastus spp, and rarely those from the genus Heledrillus spp. Swine are infected perorally with Metastrongylidae when they ingest infected earthworms...|$|E
40|$|The {{residual}} {{effect of a}} 0. 2 mg kg− 1 injectable formulation of moxidectin against lungworm and gastrointestinal nematodes in cattle was studied in a grazing experiment in the Netherlands. Five groups of four calves were grazed between May and October 1991 and one similar group was used as permanently housed control group {{for the evaluation of}} the development of immunity against lungworm by challenge infections with 5000 larvae of all six groups. The main parameter used to determine the {{residual effect}} for lungworm was faecal larval counts. Additional information was derived from pasture larval counts, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respiration frequency, coughing score and, particularly for evaluating development of immunity, worm counts. For gastrointestinal nematode infections faecal egg counts and larval differentiation of faecal cultures were the main parameters used. Pasture larval counts and an ELISA for Ostertagia and Cooperia were used as additional parameters. In three treated groups lungworm larvae (re) appeared in the faeces after 67, 95 and 119 days, respectively. This implies that a 100 % residual effect did not last longer than 67 − 21 = 46 days. The treated group with patency starting on Day 95 was exposed to extremely high infection pressure and the ELISA indicated some host-parasite interactions from 2 – 4 weeks after treatment. Thus some interaction between moxidectin treatment and high infection pressure delayed the onset of patency in comparison to another treated group under much lower infection pressure. In all treated groups, including the one under high infection pressure, <b>lungworm</b> <b>disease</b> was prevented and the worm counts demonstrated development of immunity. In contrast, severe <b>lungworm</b> <b>disease</b> occurred in two control groups grazing together with the ‘high infection pressure’ treated group. The faecal egg counts and differentiation of larvae from faecal cultures demonstrated a 100 % residual effect of at least 3 weeks and indicated a high residual effect of approximately 5 weeks against Ostertagia. Moxidectin suppressed Cooperia faecal egg counts for over 98 % and the results indicated a more than 95 % residual effect on faecal egg output during 2 – 3 weeks. The ELISA results were indicative for a delay of 2 weeks in the acquisition of gastrointestinal nematode infections following moxidectin treatment...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{spread of}} the {{invasive}} snail Pomacea canaliculata is expanding the rat <b>lungworm</b> <b>disease</b> beyond its native range. Their toxic eggs have virtually no predators and unusual defenses including a neurotoxic lectin and a proteinase inhibitor, presumably advertised by a warning coloration. We explored the effect of egg perivitellin fluid (PVF) ingestion on the rat small intestine morphology and physiology. Methodology/Principal Findings: Through a combination of biochemical, histochemical, histopathological, scanning electron microscopy, cell culture and feeding experiments, we analyzed intestinal morphology, growth rate, hemaglutinating activity, cytotoxicity and cell proliferation after oral administration of PVF to rats. PVF adversely affects small intestine metabolism and morphology and consequently the standard growth rate, presumably by lectin-like proteins, as suggested by PVF hemaglutinating activity and its cytotoxic effect on Caco- 2 cell culture. Short-term effects of ingested PVF were studied in growing rats. PVF-supplemented diet induced the appearance of shorter and wider villi as well as fused villi. This was associated with changes in glycoconjugate expression, increased cell proliferation at crypt base, and hypertrophic mucosal growth. This resulted in a decreased absorptive surface after 3 days of treatment and a diminished rat growth rate that reverted to normal after the fourth day of treatment. Longer exposure to PVF induced a time-dependent lengthening of the small intestine while switching to a control diet restored intestine length and morphology after 4 days...|$|E

Longer exposure to PVF induced a time-dependent lengthening of the small intestine while switching to a control diet restored intestine length and morphology after 4 days. Ingestion of PVF rapidly limits the ability of potential predators to absorb nutrients by inducing large, reversible changes in intestinal morphology and growth rate. The occurrence of toxins that affect intestinal morphology and absorption is a strategy against predation not recognized among animals before. Remarkably, this defense is rather similar to the toxic effect of plant antipredator strategies. This defense mechanism may explain the near absence of predators of apple snail eggs...|$|E
40|$|The {{nematode}} Angiostrongylus cantonensis is a zoonotic pathogen and the etiological {{agent of}} human angiostrongyliasis or rat <b>lungworm</b> <b>disease.</b> Hawai'i, particularly east Hawai'i Island, is the epicenter for angiostrongyliasis in the USA. Rats (Rattus spp.) are the definitive hosts while gastropods are intermediate hosts. The main {{objective of this}} study was to collect adult A. cantonensis from wild rats to isolate protein for the development of a blood-based diagnostic, in the process we evaluated the prevalence of infection in wild rats. A total of 545 wild rats were sampled from multiple sites in the South Hilo District of east Hawai'i Island. Adult male and female A. cantonensis (3, 148) were collected from the hearts and lungs of humanely euthanized Rattus rattus, and R. exulans. Photomicrography and documentation of multiple stages of this parasitic nematode in situ were recorded. A total of 45. 5 % (197 / 433) of rats inspected had lung lobe(s) (mostly upper right) which appeared granular indicating this lobe may serve as a filter for worm passage to the rest of the lung. Across Rattus spp., 72. 7 % (396 / 545) were infected with adult worms, but 93. 9 % (512 / 545) of the rats were positive for A. cantonensis infection based on presence of live adult worms, encysted adult worms, L 3 larvae and/or by PCR analysis of brain tissue. In R. rattus we observed an inverse correlation with increased body mass and infection level of adult worms, and a direct correlation between body mass and encysted adult worms in the lung tissue, indicating that larger (older) rats may have developed a means of clearing infections or regulating the worm burden upon reinfection. The exceptionally high prevalence of A. cantonensis infection in Rattus spp. in east Hawai'i Island is cause for concern and indicates the potential for human infection with this emerging zoonosis is greater than previously thought...|$|E
40|$|Lungworm (Metastrongylus spp.) {{occurrence}} in wild boar (Sus scrofa feru s) was examined in two boar enclosures (fenced areas) {{and in the}} surrounding open area of middle Somogy county, SW-Hungary, in the 2002 / 03 hunting season. The studied areas presented the following characteristics: 1) S - e n c l o s u re (E 1) : 300 ha, 88 % forest cover and 220 boars prior the hunting season; food containing ivermectin used for 7 days in late May. 2) T-enclosure (E 2) : 213 ha, 61 % forest and 170 boars; food containing albendazole was offered for one week in late May and one week in late June. 3) The open hunting area (OH) : 6. 000 ha, 67 % afforestation, estimated boar population around 250 - 300 individuals. During the hunting season (November - January), the harvested animals were investigated at the carcass collecting sites. Worms were collected from the lungs and were counted using a stereomicroscope in the laboratory. Bootstrap 2 -sample t-test was applied for the statistical analysis. Lungworm occurrence of boars shot in E 1 (n= 98) showed 90. 8 % prevalence with 104. 2 mean and 79 median intensity. Boars shot in E 2 (n= 40) had 50. 5 % prevalence with 76. 05 mean and 23. 5 median intensity. OH boars (n= 17) had 88. 2 % prevalence with 57. 3 mean and 30 median intensity. There {{were no significant differences}} among the mean intensity values of the sample groups, however the mean abundance of the E 1 and E 2 boars differed strongly, even at the 0. 2 % level. According to the age and sex groups, significant differences were proved between the mean intensity values of the young boars (51. 5 worm/host, both sexes pooled) and the adult saws (108. 0 worm/ host) in E 1 only. On the basis of the above findings we think that one anthelmintic treatment (either with albendazole or ivermectin) during the summer – if necessary at all – is enough to avoid the outbreak of a serious <b>lungworm</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|E
