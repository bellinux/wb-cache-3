25|$|Early {{studies have}} used the term stage to {{describe}} the possible states of feedback as shown schematically in the figure on the right. As the flow speed increases (Reynolds number, Re) the frequency slowly climbs (nearly constant Strouhal number, St) but then the frequency jumps up abruptly to a higher stage. As the flow speed is later decreased the frequency slowly decreases but then jumps down abruptly to a <b>lower</b> <b>stage.</b> This pattern is called a hysteresis loop.|$|E

25|$|The interstage, which {{connects the}} upper and <b>lower</b> <b>stage</b> for Falcon 9, is a carbon fiber {{aluminum}} core composite structure. Separation collets and a pneumatic pusher system separate the stages. The Falcon9 tank walls and domes are made from aluminium-lithium alloy. SpaceX uses an all-friction stir welded tank, a technique which minimizes manufacturing defects and reduces cost, according to a NASA spokesperson. The second-stage tank of Falcon9 is simply a shorter version of the first-stage tank and uses most of the same tooling, material and manufacturing techniques. This saves money during vehicle production.|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapy is the {{mainstay}} of treatment for lymphoma in cats. Most of the drugs used in dogs are used in cats, but the most common protocol uses cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone. Gastrointestinal lymphoma has also commonly been treated {{with a combination of}} prednisolone and high dose pulse chlorambucil with success. The white blood cell count must be monitored. Remission and survival times are comparable to dogs. <b>Lower</b> <b>stage</b> lymphoma has a better prognosis. Multicentric lymphoma has a better response to treatment than the gastrointestinal form, but infection with FeLV worsens the prognosis.|$|E

The gently pitched hipped roof is pierced by two brick chimneys {{at either end}} with a copper roofed cupola in the middle. It has keystone-arched louvered vents in its <b>lower</b> <b>stage,</b> separated by pairs of smooth Corinthian columns. They support a broad overhanging modillioned cornice, above which is a frieze decorated with swag. Atop the cupola is a flared domed roof with a weathervane.|$|E

Incidentally diagnosed renal cell cancer (no symptoms) differs in outlook from those diagnosed after presenting symptoms of renal cell carcinoma or metastasis. The 5 year survival rate was higher for incidental than for symptomatic tumours: 85.3% versus 62.5%. Incidental lesions were significantly <b>lower</b> <b>stage</b> than those that cause symptoms, since 62.1% patients with incidental renal cell carcinoma were observed with Stage I lesions, against 23% were found with symptomatic renal cell carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|The Tomorrowland Terrace is a {{stage in}} Tomorrowland. It is a two-story stage where the <b>lower</b> <b>stage</b> rises from below floor level. It was popular in the 1960s with music {{performers}} of the day. Over the years, it was eventually replaced with Club Buzz, a Buzz Lightyear-themed stage and show featuring the space character from the Toy Story films. In 2006, it was restored to the Tomorrowland Terrace with the same style and design as the original. It is now home to the Jedi Training Academy interactive stage show where children are chosen as Jedi padawan and taught {{how to use a}} lightsaber. Each child then has the opportunity to face Star Wars antagonists Darth Vader or Darth Maul. Also, local bands have returned to play in the evenings, just as Tomorrowland Terrace hosted in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|The west {{tower is}} Perpendicular style of three stages surmounted on its parapet by eight crocketed pinnacles, one at each corner and one along each {{side at the}} centre. The bases of the corner pinnacles contain {{grotesque}} gargoyles. The centre pinnacles sit on triangular projections that run below the parapet, with grotesque corbels at their base that intersect with the hood mould archmoulded arch projections against the wallabove the belfry openings on the tower third stage. The belfry openings are of four lights each, twin-tiered and louvered, topped with trefoil openings. The 13th-century tower <b>lower</b> <b>stage</b> is supported by buttresses at the centre of each wall, its socle, or plinth, topped by a scotia, or rolled moulding. Within the tower north wall middle stage is embedded a fragment of Anglo-Saxon sculpture. The tower contains six bells, and a clock offset to the north on its east face.|$|E
50|$|A {{free-standing}} {{bell tower}} {{seems to have}} existed until the early 15th century, further to the west. The present, leaning west tower was built in stages, and completed between 1441 and 1460. The highest stage is at a different angle to the vertical to the <b>lower</b> <b>stages,</b> as the masons attempted to correct for the subsidence of the <b>lower</b> <b>stages.</b> The {{top of the tower}} leans 1.64 m from the vertical. It is 114 ft high. The lean is popularly attributed to the foundations of the tower being built on top of wool-sacks but is most likely due to the soft alluvial clay underneath being compressed.|$|R
50|$|Most ringers {{follow the}} {{definition}} of a peal as regulated by the Central Council. This requires a minimum of only 5,000 changes where major or a higher stage is being rung; but demands at least the full 5,040 changes on <b>lower</b> <b>stages.</b> For triples, this ensures at least a full extent; for <b>lower</b> <b>stages</b> a full extent falls well short of the goal and ringers must complete several full extents to reach 5,040 (working out mathematically to at least 7 extents on six bells, at least 42 on five, or at least 210 on four; three-bell peals are not recognised by the Central Council).|$|R

25|$|The {{church is}} built in brick, faced {{on the outside}} with local gritstone, and with yellow {{terracotta}} dressings. Its plan consists of a five-bay nave with aisles, a clerestory and transepts at the western end. The chancel has one bay, over which is the tower. To {{the east of the}} chancel is an apsidal sanctuary and to the north is a vestry. The west façade has two lancet windows with a round window above. The bays are separated by buttresses, each bay containing two round-arched windows in the aisles and two round windows in the clerestory. The tower has two round-headed windows on the north and south sides in the <b>lower</b> <b>stage.</b> Above this is a tall bell chamber with two large arched openings on each face. The roof is hipped with steep gables on the east and west faces, each containing a vesica piscis opening. It is covered in lead. The apse has a half-conical roof; it is divided into three bays by buttresses, each bay containing a round-headed window.|$|E
25|$|In {{the autumn}} term of 1949, some Swedish school districts {{introduced}} an experiment with a nine-year school called enhetsskola. The enhetsskola had three stages. The first 3 years were lågstadium (<b>lower</b> <b>stage),</b> {{the next three}} years were mellanstadium (middle stage) and the last three years were högstadium (upper stage). In those school districts, småskola became lågstadium, folkskola became mellanstadium and realskola became högstadium. On 26 May 1950 the Swedish parliament decided to introduce the enhetsskola in Sweden. In 1958 the enhetsskola became försöksskola, which in 1962 changed name to grundskola. By 1972, the grundskola had been introduced in all parts in Sweden, replacing the folkskola and högre allmänna läroverket. From the autumn term of 1994, the official division in three different stages was abolished. In the early 1990s, Sweden also introduced förskoleklass for the children aged 6, a one-year-long grade which first was called årskurs 0 (Grade 0) or 6-årsgrupp (group for the six-year-olds). Förskoleklass, which officially became the name from the 1998-1999 school year, is not mandatory.|$|E
25|$|Hindhead {{became a}} {{substantial}} {{settlement in the}} late 19th century. In 1904 a temporary mission church was built to serve the new community. An architectural competition to design a permanent church, that of St Albans in Beacon Hill, was held in 1906, and John Duke Coleridge (1879-1934) {{was chosen as the}} architect. The first phase, comprising the chancel, north chapel, transept and the <b>lower</b> <b>stage</b> of a projected bell tower, was completed by 1907, and the church gained its own parish in the same year. A series of windows by the Arts and Crafts designers Karl Parsons and Christopher Whall were installed in the unfinished church between 1908 and 1912. The three eastern bays of the nave were consecrated in 1915, but the two western bays were not built until 1929-31; the bell-tower was never completed and became in effect a south transept. There followed two additional stained glass windows: by Christopher Webb in 1945 and by Francis Skeat in 1950. A large vestry extension was added in 1964. A fire in 1999 destroyed the original high altar and reredos paintings.|$|E

25|$|The {{tower is}} early 14th-century, Perpendicular, and of two stagesa tall <b>lower</b> <b>stage,</b> with belfry aboveand is partly clasped {{by the north}} and south aisles. Angled buttresses of three steps run at each corner to the belfry stage and are {{continued}} to near the parapet by square shafts, topped by crocketed pinnacles set away from the tower face. On both west corners the buttresses sit on a moulded socle (plinth) topped by a cill bandangled projection that allows water to flow from a building facethat continues in this style around the tower and south aisle only. The north-east and south-east buttresses spring from {{the north and south}} aisle and nave roofs. The north-west corner has a five-sided stair turret built out from the tower, with a slit window at the west, and belfry stairs within. Between each angle buttress, except those at the stair turret corner, is a projecting gargoyle {{at the height of the}} clerestory parapet. The tower 14th-century west doorway is pointed, with four set-back continuous mouldings set on a single running plinth. Around the doorway, from the spring, is a hood mould. Within the doorway is a plank double door with large decorative iron face hinges.|$|E
500|$|The façade of {{the cathedral}} is {{dominated}} by a large deeply recessed eight-light window in the Perpendicular style, above a recessed doorway set in a screen-like porch designed, probably by Seth and George Derwall, in the early 1500s. This porch formed {{part of the same}} late 15th-century building programme as the south transept, central and southwest towers, and cloister. Neither of the west towers was completed. To the north is the <b>lower</b> <b>stage</b> of a Norman tower, while to the south is the <b>lower</b> <b>stage</b> of a tower designed and begun, probably by Seth and George Derwall, in 1508, but left incomplete following the dissolution of the monastery in 1538. [...] The cathedral's façade is abutted on the north by a Victorian building housing the [...] education centre and largely obscured from view by the building previously used as the King's School, which is now a branch of Barclays Bank. The door of the west front is not used as the normal entrance to the cathedral, which is through the southwest porch which is in an ornate Tudor style.|$|E

500|$|Sadler {{also wrote}} about race: {{he had an}} {{interest}} in eugenics, likely owing to Kellogg's interest in the concept, and Madison Grant's book The Passing of the Great Race. Sadler wrote several works about eugenics, endorsing and heavily borrowing from Grant's views, which posited that the [...] "Nordic race" [...] was superior to others. In his writings, Sadler contended that some races were at a <b>lower</b> <b>stage</b> of evolution—closer to Neanderthals than were other races—and were consequently less civilized and more aggressive. [...] Sadler argued that alcoholism and [...] "feeblemindedness, insanity, and delinquency" [...] were hereditary traits and that those who possessed them were breeding at a much faster rate than [...] "superior human beings". He feared that this issue could threaten the [...] "civilization we bequeath our descendants". He also believed that the majority of criminals were mentally ill.|$|E
