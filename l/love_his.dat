5|$|Trollope has {{described}} {{again and again}} the ravages of <b>love...</b> <b>His</b> story is always primarily a love-story, and a love-story constructed on an inveterate system. There is a young lady who has two lovers, or {{a young man who}} has two sweethearts; we are treated to the innumerable forms in which this predicament may present itself and the consequences, sometimes pathetic, sometimes grotesque, which spring from such false situations.|$|E

No one cared to rescue Judd when he was harmed throughout his youth. Despite Judd's growing into a harsh man, reviewer Hary Sheehan noted, he preserves a glimmer of empathy. Journalist Kate Cavanaugh wrote that Judds' inability to love and cherish Shiloh is borne because of the <b>love</b> <b>his</b> family nurtured in him.|$|E

Jesus, as depicted on the walls, domes and windows of churches, is the Revelation of God's <b>love,</b> <b>his</b> grace, his mercy and his glory. This, broadly speaking, is the theme of every Poor Man's Bible.|$|E

It was while acting as a curate that he met Grace Taylor, the {{daughter}} of a mill hand, then aged fourteen.

25|$|The Mayan god Chin, {{reported}} from the sixteenth century, {{is said to}} have introduced homoeroticism into the Mayan culture and subsequently became associated with same-sex <b>love.</b> <b>His</b> example inspired noble families to purchase young men as lovers for their sons, creating legal relationships akin to marriage. An important Mayan deity best known from the Classical period (200-900 AD), the so-called Tonsured Maize God, is often depicted in Maya art as an effeminate young man associated with art and dance, and is thought to have constituted a 'third gender'.|$|E

25|$|Many biblical authors draw {{a strong}} {{connection}} between love {{of others and}} love of God. 1 John 4 states that for one to love God one must <b>love</b> <b>his</b> fellowman, and that hatred of one's fellowman {{is the same as}} hatred of God. Thomas Jay Oord has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love. An altruistic action is not always a loving action. Oord defines altruism as acting for the other's good, and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one's own good when the other's demands undermine overall well-being.|$|E
25|$|While {{out for a}} walk, Marianne {{gets caught}} {{in the rain and}} slips and sprains her ankle. The dashing John Willoughby sees the {{accident}} and assists her. Marianne quickly comes to admire his good looks and outspoken views on poetry, music, art, and <b>love.</b> <b>His</b> attentions lead Elinor and Mrs Dashwood to suspect that the couple have become secretly engaged. Elinor cautions Marianne against her unguarded conduct, but Marianne refuses to check her emotions. Abruptly, Mr Willoughby informs the Dashwoods that his aunt, upon whom he is financially dependent, is sending him to London on business, indefinitely. Marianne is distraught and abandons herself to her sorrow.|$|E
25|$|Carroll {{sees this}} {{societal}} belief as vital {{in interpreting the}} final scene of the play, arguing that Valentine does give Silvia to Proteus, and in so doing, he is merely acting {{in accordance with the}} practices of the day. However, if one accepts that Valentine does not give Silvia to Proteus, as critics such as Jeffrey Masten argue, but instead offers to love Proteus as much as he loves Silvia, then the conclusion of the play can be read as a final triumphant reconciliation between friendship and love; Valentine intends to <b>love</b> <b>his</b> friend as much as he does his betrothed. Love and friendship are shown to be co-existent, not exclusive.|$|E

25|$|Searching through old videos, {{the team}} learned that Ernie {{had a son}} who'd changed his name from Lionel Dell to Mitchell Douglas. The CSIs assumed {{that he could be}} the killer. However, they soon learned that Ernie’s son despised his father, and that Ernie seemed to <b>love</b> <b>his</b> adopted {{children}} more. Upon learning of his fostering of children, the CSIs learned from a video tape that Ernie had at least thirteen foster kids, any one of which could be the Miniature Killer. The CSIs managed to slowly narrow down the list after tracking numerous of the Dell foster children down, some of whom had died over the years. After epithelials were discovered on a fingerprint of one of the miniature dolls made by the Miniature Killer, the CSI team learned that the killer was female, narrowing down the list of children further.|$|E
25|$|After the war Heffer briefly {{lived in}} Hertford again with his parents, and fought as a Communist {{candidate}} for Hertford Urban District Council in 1946, but was defeated. He then settled in Liverpool, {{where there was}} a strong working-class community and within it a large group of left-wing workers waiting to be organised. Although from the east of England, Heffer grew to <b>love</b> <b>his</b> adopted city and supported Everton F.C.. He responded to the demand for a left-wing political organisation in 1954 by linking with a group led by Harry McShane (from Glasgow) and the Militant Socialist Group from London to establish the 'Federation of Marxist Groups' (later renamed the 'Socialist Workers Federation') which had a policy of syndicalism. This group was a compromise: while it insisted that it itself was not a revolutionary political party, it simultaneously said that there was a need for such a party, and actively rejected the Labour Party. However, Heffer had decided by 1956 to rejoin the Labour Party.|$|E

25|$|To {{reflect his}} early personality, the Beast is seen shirtless, with ragged, dark gray breeches, and a ragged reddish-colored cape {{with a golden}} colored circular-shaped clasp. Despite the actual color of his cape being a dark reddish color, the Beast's cape is more often {{referenced}} to be purple (and {{in most of the}} Beast's subsequent appearances after the film, such as Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas or the Kingdom Hearts games, his cape is colored purple). The reason for this change in color is unknown, although the most likely reason is that the color purple is often associated with royalty. After the Beast saves Belle from a pack of wolves, his dress-style changes to become more formal and disciplined, reflecting a more refined personality as he attempts to win Belle's friendship and <b>love.</b> <b>His</b> most referenced form of dress is his ballroom outfit, which consisted of a golden vest over a white dress shirt with a white kerchief, black dress pants trimmed with gold, and a royal blue ballroom tail coat trimmed with gold, worn during the film's ballroom dance sequence.|$|E

25|$|Imonida, {{the love}} of Oroonoko’s life, is a {{beautiful}} African woman who is sold into slavery after Oroonoko attempts to rescue her. When Oroonoko meets Imonida, they instantly fall in <b>love.</b> <b>His</b> first encounter with her is described as, “a beauty, that to describe her truly she was female to the noble male, the beautiful black Venus to our young Mars, as charming in her person as he, and of delicate virtues” (Behn, 9). Oroonoko is smitten by her, instantly asks her for her hand in marriage, and without hesitation she agrees. Although the African tradition of having more than one wife is still prevalent during this time, Oroonoko assures Imonida that he will never take on another wife. It {{is evident in the}} novella that Oroonoko and Imonida’s love for one another is unconditional. Once the King, Oroonoko’s grandfather, hears different rumors of how beautiful Imoinda is, he becomes adamant on making her one of his women. Despite his grandson’s deep affection and love for Imonida, the King gives her a royal veil which officially marks Imoinda as one of the King’s women. This is an honor that is nearly impossible to refuse and Oroonoko is angered by his grandfather’s actions. Imonida becomes a vital character by becoming the heart and center of this tragic travel narrative alongside Oroonko. Her beauty, strength, and flawless characteristics attract Oroonoko, the King, and even the reader for that matter. Oroonoko and Imoinda were constantly being separated once Imoinda gets sold into slavery. Regardless of how long they were a part, their love remained strong and eventually they are reunited. This never ending love between Oroonoko and Imoinda is evident throughout the novella. Both characters are willing to announce their love, make brutal sacrifices, and remain passionate for one another which helps solidify the strength of their unconditional love.|$|E
