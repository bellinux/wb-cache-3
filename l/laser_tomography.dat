40|$|AIM—To {{assess the}} {{morphological}} change in retinal topography using a scanning laser tomographer following macular hole surgery. To compare {{the results of}} scanning <b>laser</b> <b>tomography</b> with clinical evaluation and visual function assessment.  METHODS—The sample for this pilot study comprised four eyes exhibiting different stages of macular hole formation preoperatively. Subjects were assessed preoperatively and at 1  and 3  months postoperatively. Each assessment included visual acuity, letter contrast sensitivity, clinical examination (including automated static perimetry), and scanning <b>laser</b> <b>tomography.</b> The Heidelberg retina tomograph (HRT) was used to acquire digitised scanning <b>laser</b> <b>tomography</b> images of the macula (10 ° and 20 ° fields). Surgery essentially comprised vitrectomy, peeling of the posterior hyaloid face, if still attached, and intraocular gas tamponade. The magnitude and significance of topographic change were determined postoperatively using the HRT topographic difference facility.  RESULTS—Topographic difference analysis of {{the right and left}} eyes of case 1  showed a significant reduction in the height of the retina postoperatively. Topographic difference analysis of case 2  showed no significant change in topography. Topographic difference analysis of case 3  showed {{a significant increase in the}} height of the retina postoperatively. Scanning <b>laser</b> <b>tomography</b> agreed with clinical assessment based upon fundus biomicroscopy in three of the four eyes studied; the postoperative closure of the stage 2  macular hole (as noted by clinical assessment) proved to be too small to reach statistical significance. Scanning <b>laser</b> <b>tomography</b> agreed with the assessment of visual function in two eyes; the agreement between scanning <b>laser</b> <b>tomography</b> and visual function depends, in part, on the stage of development of the macular hole.  CONCLUSION—Scanning <b>laser</b> <b>tomography</b> provides an objective evaluation of the outcome of macular hole surgery. Studies employing larger sample sizes are required to fully determine the clinical worth of the technique. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{incidence}} of malignant melanoma {{has shown a}} dramatic increase {{over the past three}} decades. Patient outcome and curability depend on early diagnosis. In vivo multiphoton <b>laser</b> <b>tomography</b> represents a recently developed diagnostic tool that allows non-invasive tissue imaging. We aim to demonstrate the application of multiphoton <b>laser</b> <b>tomography</b> for the in vivo differentiation and diagnosis of melanoma. Laser radiation in the near infrared spectrum was used to image endogenous fluorophores by multiphoton excitation. Eighty-three melanocytic skin lesions have been investigated. The results showed distinct morphological differences in melanoma compared with melanocytic nevi. In particular, six characteristic features of malignant melanoma were specified and statistically evaluated. Sensitivity values up to 95 % (range: 71 – 95 %) and specificity values up to 97 % (range: 69 – 97 %) were achieved for diagnostic classification. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the most significant diagnostic criteria. We found that architectural disarray of the epidermis, poorly defined keratinocyte cell borders as well as the presence of pleomorphic or dendritic cells were of prime importance. By means of this procedure accuracy values up to 97 % were reached. These findings underline the potential applicability of multiphoton <b>laser</b> <b>tomography</b> in melanoma diagnosis of melanocytic skin lesions...|$|E

Rayleigh scattering from premixed flames can be used for temperature imaging, and we have developed crossed-plane Rayleigh imaging in order to measure with high-resolution instantaneous temperature fields, temperature gradient vectors and isothermal surface densities in premixed reacting flows.

40|$|Multiphoton excited tissue {{fluorescence}} summarises {{the emission}} of all naturally occurring endogenous fluorescent bio-molecules with their often overlapping fluorescence spectra. Common fluorescence intensity measurements {{could not be}} utilised to distinguish between different fluorophores or metabolic states. To overcome this limitation, we investigated new procedures of selective melanin imaging and spectral fluorescence lifetime imaging in combination with high resolution multiphoton <b>laser</b> <b>tomography.</b> Overall 46 melanocytic lesions of human skin were analysed. We suggested that fluorescence light, detected in such a way, may yield additional information for melanoma diagnostics. Remarkable differences in lifetime behaviour of keratinocytes in contrast to melanocytes were observed. Fluorescence lifetime distribution was found in correlation with the intracellular amount of melanin. Spectral analysis of melanoma revealed a main fluorescence peak around 470 nm in combination with an additional peak close to 550 nm throughout all epidermal layers. Excitation at 800 nm shows a selectively observable fluorescence of melanin containing cells and offers the possibility of cell classification. Procedures of selective imaging as well as spectral fluorescence lifetime imaging by means of multiphoton <b>laser</b> <b>tomography</b> support diagnostic decisions and may improve the process of non-invasive early detection of melanoma...|$|E

40|$|To reduce {{greenhouse}} gas emissions from fossil fuel fired power plants a range of new combustion technologies are being developed or refined, including oxy­fuel combustion, co­firing biomass with coal and fluidized bed combustion. Flame characteristics under such combustion conditions {{are expected to be}} different from those in normal air fired combustion processes. Quantified flame characteristics such as temperature distribution, oscillation frequency, and ignition volume play an important part in the optimized design and operation of the environmentally friendly power generation systems.
