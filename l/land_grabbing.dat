In 2007, MLA Umakant Yadav of her own political party accused in a <b>land</b> <b>grabbing</b> case, was arrested near her dwelling on her orders. During September–October 2010, {{at the time of}} the Ayodhya verdict, her government maintained law and order and the state remain peaceful. Several high-profile criminals and mafia dons were jailed during her terms in office. She called for strong anti-rape laws. Fewer riots, lowest rapes, and least corruption occurred during her tenure as compared to previous or successive governments. In the 2007-2012 assembly, only 124 MLAs were crorepatis as compared to 271 crorepatis in successive assembly elected in 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} of Kenyatta's succession {{had been an}} issue of debate in Kenya ever since independence, and he had not unreservedly nominated a successor. However, the transition of power proved smooth, something which surprised many international commentators. As Vice President, Moi {{was sworn in as}} Acting President for a 90-day interim period. In October he was unanimously elected KANU President and subsequently declared President of Kenya itself. Moi emphasised his loyalty to Kenyatta—"I followed and was faithful to him until his last day, even when his closest friends forsook him"—and there was much expectation that he would continue the policies inaugurated by Kenyatta. He nevertheless criticised the corruption, <b>land</b> <b>grabbing,</b> and capitalistic ethos that had characterised Kenyatta's period and expressed populist tendencies by emphasising a closer link to the poor. In 1982 he would amend the Kenyan constitution to create a de jure one-party state.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} single-player story, Undead Nightmare adds two {{multiplayer}} modes: Undead Overrun and <b>Land</b> <b>Grab.</b> The former is a horde mode in which {{up to four}} players cooperatively fight off waves of zombies. Players must open coffins between waves to replenish a countdown timer, which discourages players from camping in the same location. It is also designed so as to encourage cooperation such that players can revive each other if nearby. The other mode, <b>Land</b> <b>Grab,</b> is an additional game mode within the main game's multiplayer free roam and otherwise unconnected to the undead theme. In <b>Land</b> <b>Grab,</b> players attempt to secure seven areas across the game's environment. While players with the base game can join in <b>Land</b> <b>Grab</b> games, only Undead Nightmare owners can initiate them.|$|R

25|$|Profit {{income from}} {{ordinary}} land sales, for example, {{is not included}} in official value-added, since land transactions do not result in additional land (See also gross fixed capital formation, differential and absolute ground rent and <b>land</b> <b>grabbing).</b> Official fixed capital aggregates exclude the value of land, and no very reliable official estimates exist for the value of land, because of problems with credibly valuing land in a standard way for measurement purposes. If the world market prices for farm products rise, profit rates on land sales and commercial land values will increase; even if the number of land sales stays constant, the profit on land sales will increase.|$|E
25|$|Retaking Constantinople and {{creating}} a Christian empire centered there {{does not appear to}} be a very enlightened plan. However, Catherine saw <b>land</b> <b>grabbing</b> as an easy way to assert Russia's intentions. By declaring that Constantinople would one day belong to Christians, she also appeased the Church, which still held significant influence in the 18th century. She wished to show Western Europe that her country would be a powerful presence in European political matters. Catherine's partition of Poland was an even more blatant example of power politics. Russia invaded three separate times, in 1772, 1793, and 1795, and divided the once important European state between itself, Austria and Prussia. The 3rd May Constitution of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth voted in 1791 was considered by Catherine as a Jacobin threat and as a therefore presenting a threat to Russia's monarchy and its influence in Poland, which ultimately led to a military expedition resulting in the destruction of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.|$|E

40|$|The current global <b>land</b> <b>grab</b> {{is causing}} radical {{changes in the}} use and {{ownership}} of land. The main process driving the <b>land</b> <b>grab,</b> or ‘foreignisation of space’, as highlighted {{in the media and}} the emerging literature is the production of food and biofuel for export in the aftermath of recent food and energy crises. However, there are several other processes driving the land rush. In this article I argue that an analytical framework that focuses on only one or two processes that drive the global <b>land</b> <b>grab</b> offers a narrow perspective on this complex process. It will be unable {{to take into account the}} full range and extent of agrarian and social changes that occur in light of the <b>land</b> <b>grab</b> and their strategic implications for poor people’s livelihoods. An important starting point is to identify the broad processes driving the current land rush, and trace their structural and institutional origins. To do so, I identify and examine seven factors that are giving rise to radical changes in landownership and land use in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Finally, ‘codes of conduct’ as proposed by several quarters in the context of global <b>land</b> <b>grab</b> are unlikely to work in favour of the poor...|$|R

As part of the surveying effort, several tracts were designated [...] "government reserves", which included Stanley Park as a military reserve (a strategic location {{in case of an}} American invasion). The Pre-emption act did not specify conditions for distributing the land, so large parcels were snapped up by speculators, including 3,750 acres (1,517 hectares) by Moody himself. For this he was criticized by local newspapermen for <b>land</b> <b>grabbing.</b> Port Moody is named after him.

2500|$|Bengal's {{economy was}} {{predominantly}} agrarian. For {{at least a}} decade before the crisis, between half and three quarters of those dependent on agriculture were already at near subsistence level. Underlying causes of the famine included inefficient agricultural practices, dense population, and de-peasantisation through debt bondage and <b>land</b> <b>grabbing.</b> Proximate causes comprise localised natural disasters (a cyclone, storm surges and flooding, and rice crop disease) and at least five consequences of war: initial, general war-time inflation of both demand-pull and monetary origin; loss of rice imports due to the Japanese occupation of Burma (modern Myanmar); near-total disruption of Bengal's market supplies and transport systems by the preemptive, defensive scorched earth tactics of the Raj (the [...] "" [...] for rice and boats); and later, massive inflation brought on by repeated policy failures, war profiteering, speculation, and perhaps hoarding. Finally, the government prioritised military and defense needs over those of the rural poor, allocating medical care and food immensely in the favour of the military, labourers in military industries, and civil servants. All of these factors were further compounded by restricted access to grain: domestic sources were constrained by emergency inter-provincial trade barriers, while access to international sources was largely denied by the War Cabinet of Great Britain. The relative impact of each of these contributing factors to the death toll and economic devastation is still a matter of controversy. Different analyses frame the famine against natural, economic, or political causes.|$|E
