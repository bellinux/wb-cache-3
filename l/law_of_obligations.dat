25|$|Another {{dimension}} of the theoretical debate in contract is its place within, and relationship to a wider <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations.</b> Obligations have traditionally been divided into contracts, which are voluntarily undertaken and owed to a specific person or persons, and obligations in tort {{which are based on}} the wrongful infliction of harm to certain protected interests, primarily imposed by the law, and typically owed to a wider class of persons.|$|E
25|$|Companies {{occupy a}} special place in private law, because they have a legal {{personality}} separate from those who invest their capital and labour to run the business. The general rules of contract, tort and unjust enrichment operate in the first place against the company as a distinct entity. This differs fundamentally from other forms of business association. A sole trader acquires rights and duties as normal under the general <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations.</b> If people carry on business together with a view to profit, they are deemed to have formed a partnership under the Partnership Act 1890 section 1. Like a sole trader, partners will be liable on any contract or tort obligation jointly and severally in shares equal to their monetary contribution, or according to their culpability. Law, accountancy and actuarial firms are commonly organised as partnerships. Since the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000, partners can limit the amount they are liable for to their monetary investment in the business, if the partnership owes more money than the enterprise has. Outside these professions, however, the most common method for businesses to limit their liability is by forming a company.|$|E
2500|$|Contract law {{is based}} on the {{principle}} expressed in the Latin phrase pacta sunt servanda, ( [...] "agreements must be kept"). The common law of contract originated with the now-defuct writ of assumpsit, which was originally a tort action based on reliance. Contract law falls within the general <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations,</b> along with tort, unjust enrichment, and restitution.|$|E
40|$|The article {{explores the}} ironies {{involved}} in the contemporary enforcement <b>of</b> family <b>obligations.</b> As forms <b>of</b> intimate partnership and parenthood become ever more varied, the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> family <b>obligation</b> - child support, property division and alimony - has become increasingly routine and formulaic. As scholars increasingly {{call for more attention}} to the varied ways in which different individuals and communities structure their care networks and their intimate lives, the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> family <b>obligation</b> has become less, not more attentive to context. This piece explains how the <b>law’s</b> rejection <b>of</b> context is an understandable reaction to the growing diversity of family forms. By unpacking contemporary family law rules, one see that the baselines and value judgments informing the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> family <b>obligation</b> are usually contested or arbitrary or both. They are accepted not because they represent consensus on what obligation should be but because they clearly demarcate who is obligated and for how much. Predictability emerges as more important than context for almost everyone. Social acceptance of so many different family forms makes judicial attention to context extraordinarily invasive and expensive. In an area <b>of</b> <b>law</b> where very few of the parties have the resources or desire to debate the normative underpinnings <b>of</b> family <b>obligation</b> and where both the parties and the state have strong interests in minimizing contested issues, there are compelling reasons to establish a very rule and status based <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation,</b> even if that system is rooted in a normative vision of family that, for most people, has ceased to exist. The article thus argues that despite the profoundly limited way in which the current law identifies families, some reliance on restricted legal definitions of family will be necessary for any meaningful system <b>of</b> family <b>obligation</b> to operate. In doing so, the article challenges much contemporary family law scholarship and suggests that we may have to accept the <b>law’s</b> privileging <b>of</b> certain family forms if we are to expect an enforceable system <b>of</b> family <b>obligation...</b>|$|R

2500|$|All {{legal systems}} {{deal with the}} same basic issues, but jurisdictions {{categorise}} and identify its legal subjects in different ways. A common distinction is that between [...] "public law" [...] (a term related closely to the state, and including constitutional, administrative and criminal law), and [...] "private law" [...] (which covers contract, tort and property). In civil law systems, contract and tort fall under a general <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations,</b> while trusts law is dealt with under statutory regimes or international conventions. International, constitutional and administrative law, criminal law, contract, tort, property law and trusts are regarded as the [...] "traditional core subjects", {{although there are many}} further disciplines.|$|E
2500|$|Christian Matthias Theodor Mommsen (30 November 1817 [...] 1 November 1903) was a German {{classical}} scholar, historian, jurist, journalist, politician, archaeologist {{and writer}} {{generally regarded as}} one of the greatest classicists of the 19th century. His work regarding Roman history is still of fundamental importance for contemporary research. He received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1902 for being [...] "the greatest living master of the art of historical writing, with special reference to his monumental work A History of Rome", after having been nominated by 18 members of the Prussian Academy of Sciences. He was also a prominent German politician, as a member of the Prussian and German parliaments. His works on Roman law and on the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> had a significant impact on the German civil code (BGB).|$|E
2500|$|As {{opposed to}} tort and unjust enrichment, {{contract}} is typically {{viewed as the}} part of the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> which deals with voluntary undertakings, and accordingly gives a high priority to ensuring that only bargains to which people have given their true consent will be enforced by the courts. While it is not always clear when people have truly agreed in a subjective sense, English law takes the view that when one person objectively manifests their consent to a bargain, they will be bound. However, not all agreements, even if they are relatively certain in subject matter, are considered enforceable. There is a rebuttable presumption that people do not wish to later have legal enforcement of agreements made socially or domestically. The general rule is that contracts require no prescribed form, such as being in writing, except where statute requires it, usually for large deals like the sale of land. In addition and in contrast to civil law systems, English common law carried a general requirement that all parties, in order to have standing to enforce an agreement, must have brought something of value, or [...] "consideration" [...] to the bargain. This old rule is full of exceptions, particularly where people wished to vary their agreements, through case law and the equitable doctrine of promissory estoppel. Moreover, statutory reform in the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 allows third parties to enforce the benefit of an agreement that they had not necessarily paid for so long as the original parties to a contract consented to them being able to do so.|$|E

40|$|WTO law remains {{relatively}} uncontentious whereas international {{investment law}} elicits much more debate. This article posits {{that the differences}} in reception are attributable to deeper substantive differences about what is protected under each regime. In WTO law what is protected is {{the sum total of}} all commitments and concessions under the WTO Agreement, something that {{can be thought of as}} a “public” good. When a country injures that good, the remedy is for the country to cease the injury, a requirement that naturally places emphasis on obligation. In international investment law, by contrast, what is protected is individualized to a particular investor. The violation is evidently “private”. When a country injures that good, the usual remedy is compensation, a requirement that naturally places emphasis on the investor’s rights. This difference suggests that WTO law is primarily a <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> which is equality-oriented, prospective, constitutive and deductive, whereas international investment law is primarily a <b>law</b> <b>of</b> rights which is fairness-oriented, retrospective, contractual and inductive. A <b>law</b> <b>of</b> rights is subtractive, and to that extent, less stable. The identification explains why there have been recent moves to constitutionalize international investment law by introducing a greater degree <b>of</b> <b>obligation.</b> The change is meant to redress the perceived jurisprudential imbalance in the field and strengthen its sense of community...|$|R

40|$|This essay, {{to appear}} in Contract, Status, and Fiduciary Law (Miller 2 ̆ 6 Gold, 2016), explores three ways {{fiduciary}} obligations might be like contractual ones: in the methods lawmakers use or should use to determine {{the content of the}} obligation; in the private voluntary acts that generate the obligation; and {{in the fact that the}} obligation is a default that parties have the power to alter. The thesis is that to the extent that these similarities exist, they are not especially revealing. Theorists who emphasize the similarities commonly treat contract law as a private power-conferring rule, then analogize the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> fiduciary <b>obligations</b> to it. In fact, the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> contract is more complex and serves a broader range of purposes than just giving private parties the ability to undertake legal obligations when they choose. Contract obligations are sometimes imposed for reasons other than party choice, and contract defaults and altering rules can be designed to serve other social purposes. A more nuanced understanding of the functions and design <b>of</b> contract <b>law</b> suggests that structural similarities between fiduciary obligations and contractual ones tell us less about the fiduciary obligations than we might have hoped. The explanation of why that is so, however, reveals important features both <b>of</b> contract <b>law</b> and <b>of</b> the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> fiduciary <b>obligations...</b>|$|R

The objective of Hamida Barmaki's academic work was to provide a thorough understanding of the difficult Afghan legal system. For this purpose she used not only the classical methods of interpretation of Islamic and secular law, but also relied on comparative legal analysis as a tool to find solutions for legal problems inherent in other legal systems. She studied the necessary literature written in Dari, English, and Arabic to achieve these ends. At the university, Professor Barmaki was admired by her students and colleagues for her analytical skills and her patient and friendly manner towards everyone she met.|$|R

Regarding the de-crease of the real value of the currencies, the Montreal convention has provided a good solution by which taking into account those countries that are against the amounts increase will at least to some extent decrease the negative effect of the decrease of value of the currencies and thereby improve the position of the carrier in relation to the transport users (all of this of course to the loss of the consumer) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{considers the}} possible {{influence of the}} Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008 on the common <b>law</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> the seller vis-à-vis: 1) risk and duty to take care, 2) eviction and 3) defects. Before one can {{have a look at}} the influence of new legislation on the common law, it is necessary to first go backward to look at where it all started in order to understand any possible influence. In the first chapter there is therefore a historical overview <b>of</b> the common <b>law</b> in general as well as the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> contract. Reference is also made to the Roman law perspective as well as the Roman concept of contract; the Roman-Dutch law perspective as well as the Roman-Dutch concept of contract; and the South African law perspective as well as the South African concept of contract. In chapter 2 the common law and the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> contract is discussed in general with reference to concepts such as ownership, <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation,</b> and the emptio venditio. Chapter 3 deals with the essence of this dissertation as we look at the common <b>law</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> the seller and in specific the risk and duty of the seller to take care of the thing sold until it is handed over to the buyer (factors that influence the duty to take care, passing of risk, and passing of risk in sales by way of consignment); the seller‟s warranty against eviction (including the <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> the buyer when there is a threat of possible eviction); and the seller‟s warranty against latent defects (ex lege warranties, ex contractu warranties, the actio empti and the aedilitian actions). In chapter 4 there is a very short discussion on the influence of the Constitution of South Africa, 1996 in general as well as specifically on the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> contract. Chapter 5 deals with the influence of the Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008 in general, specifically on the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> contract (why an Act to protect the interests of consumers?) and then the influence on risk and the seller‟s duty to take care of the thing sold (the consumer‟s right to return goods; the supplier‟s obligation to draw potential risk of an unusual character or that the consumer could not reasonably be expected to be aware of or that could result in serious injury or death to the attention of the consumer), the influence on the seller‟s warranty against eviction (the consumer‟s right to assume that the supplier is entitled to sell the goods; sections 44 and 51) and the influence on the seller‟s warranty against latent defects (disclosure of reconditioned or grey market goods; quality of goods).

40|$|There {{has been}} until now no major and {{comprehensive}} study of the phenomenon of legal symbolism in ancient Mesopotamian law. The available studies have been unsystematic and lack clear and defined methodology {{in the study of}} legal symbolism. ^ The present study is a preliminary step toward a {{comprehensive study of}} legal symbolism in Mesopotamian law. It offers a model of analysis of symbolic acts which includes definitions and criteria for isolating and identifying symbolic acts on three levels: Morphology (the form of the symbolic act), Semantics (the legal meaning of the symbolic act), and Etymology (the symbolic meaning of the symbolic act). This model of analysis has been applied to a large sample of Mesopotamian symbolic acts from four legal categories: <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> Person, <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> <b>Obligation,</b> <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> Conveyance, and <b>Law</b> <b>of</b> Procedure. ^ Following this model of analysis it has been possible to identify symbolic acts as such and to delineate them from other written modes of expression such as technical expressions, legal figures of speech, and remarks alluding to technical acts. ^ The sample of symbolic acts analyzed in this study exhibits some general patterns pertaining to the phenomenon of legal symbolism in general, such as the type of relation between the symbol and symbolized, the source of the constitutive legal power of symbolic acts, the relative importance of symbolic acts and written documents, and the symbolic conceptualization of legal relationship by the Mesopotamians. These general patterns have been presented in a summary fashion in the final chapter of the study together with some suggestions for future research. ...|$|R
