25|$|<b>The</b> <b>flag</b> is {{displayed}} at half-staff (half-mast in naval usage) {{as a sign}} of respect or mourning.

However, many flag enthusiasts feel this type of practice has somewhat diminished the meaning of the original intent of <b>lowering</b> <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> <b>to</b> honor those who held high positions in federal or state offices. President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued the first proclamation on March 1, 1954, standardizing the dates and time periods for flying <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> at half-staff from all federal buildings, grounds, and naval vessels; other congressional resolutions and presidential proclamations ensued.

25|$|In many ways, Otso was a {{significant}} departure from the traditional Finnish icebreaker design. The extended bridge wings on top of the stylish superstructure feature full-depth all-round windows that provide almost 360 degree visibility from the main steering position, which has been moved to the starboard bridge wing from the centerline. Furthermore, the traditional colours dating back to the Imperial Russian era, yellow and black, were replaced with the colors of <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> of Finland, blue and white.

50|$|In December 2011, Larson {{invited the}} mayor of Portland, Oregon, Sam Adams, on the program {{to talk about a}} {{controversial}} city <b>flag</b> policy. <b>The</b> policy stated <b>the</b> city <b>flag</b> would be lowered to half staff to honor any person under the age of 18 that {{died as a result of}} homicidal violence. Larson strongly disagreed on the grounds that the city did not offer the same honor to fallen soldiers. Portland had recently <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> <b>to</b> honor a teenage boy who died as a result of gang violence. Larson questioned the message the city was sending by honoring someone that he deemed a menace. Sam Adams was scheduled on the show for two segments but only stayed for one. The interview ended with a heated exchange between the two, and Adams hanging up on Larson. Shortly after the interview, The Lars Larson Show released a free ringtone and text tone for download via Larson's SoundCloud page.|$|R

5000|$|Brennan {{organized}} a rally of construction workers {{to show support}} for Nixon's Vietnam policies and American soldiers fighting in Vietnam. At 7:30 a.m. on May 8, several hundred anti-war protesters (most of them {{high school and college}} students) began holding a memorial at Broad and Wall Streets for the four dead students at Kent State. By late morning, the protesters—now numbering more than a thousand—were demanding an end to the war in Vietnam and Cambodia, the release of [...] "political prisoners" [...] in the U.S., and an end to military-related research on all university campuses. At five minutes to noon, about 200 construction workers converged on the student rally at Federal Hall National Memorial from four directions. At first, the construction workers only pushed but did not break the thin line of police. After just two minutes, however, the workers broke through the police line and began chasing students through the streets. The workers selected those with the longest hair and swatted them with their hard hats. Attorneys, bankers and investment analysts from nearby Wall Street investment firms tried to protect many of the students but were themselves attacked. Onlookers reported that the police stood by and did nothing. A postal worker rushed onto the roof of City Hall and raised <b>the</b> American <b>flag</b> <b>to</b> full mast. When city workers <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> <b>flag</b> <b>to</b> half-mast, <b>the</b> construction workers stormed City Hall, overwhelming the police.

Six people were arrested. President Nixon held an emergency press conference to defuse the situation before tens of thousands of students arrived in Washington, D.C., for a protest rally on May 9.

A prize crew from HMS Donegal including its Master took control of the near crippled Rayo, and MacDonnell was taken prisoner on board the Donegal. It coincidentally was the French frigate that Irish revolutionary Wolfe Tone was captured on off the coast of Ireland and it was renamed. Despite the efforts of the British prize crew Rayo was to flounder on the rocks in the storm with the loss of 25 lives. The remaining Rayo crew and 25 British sailors and officers on board were rescued by small Spanish boats. The Master of HMS Donegal recounted unexpected kindness when that he was not allowed disembark the small boat in Cadiz until a small cart was reversed into the water, to ensure he could step onto it and then ashore so not to get we. MacDonnell was equally well treated while on board the Donegal and he released after a week onboard.

2500|$|Admiral Tryon was {{concerned}} that the normal system of signalling between ships would become unworkable in real war conditions. To send a signal required hoisting a flag sequence, waiting for all ships <b>to</b> raise <b>flags</b> <b>to</b> confirm they had seen and understood, and then <b>lowering</b> <b>the</b> initial <b>flags</b> <b>to</b> signal everyone to carry it out. [...] The signals book had grown to hundreds of pages describing <b>the</b> many possible <b>flag</b> combinations and virtually no one knew them all. In a real battle this process might take too much time, or might be entirely impossible if enemy fire had destroyed the masts from which <b>the</b> <b>flags</b> must fly, or smoke made them impossible to read. Instead, Tryon proposed a simple signal, using the letter-flags T and A, which simply instructed captains to follow their leader. Other flag signals might be used additionally as circumstances allowed, but once the initial order was given, the ships simply had to follow the movements of their leaders. A few, basic, single flag signals were designated for particular movements, which would simply be flown without needing acknowledgement. This was {{a radical departure from}} contemporary practice, in which all movements were precisely signalled from the flagship and acknowledged by their recipients. Opinion was fiercely divided about it, for instance The Times newspaper considered it [...] "unsound in theory and perilous in practice", whilst Rear-Admiral William Kennedy on the East Indies station declared following experiments with it that [...] "the officers commanding thoroughly appreciated the idea which would be invaluable in time of war".|$|R
5000|$|On {{the day of}} the show, both {{artists are}} indisposed as Carmela has her period and Paulino has an upset stomach from eating a rabbit which Gustavete, writing on his slate, now {{confirms}} to have been a cat. The presence of the Polish prisoners, who have been brought to witness a mockery of their ideals, greatly upsets Carmela, and she initially refuses to perform a number involving <b>the</b> republican <b>flag.</b> Structurally, <b>the</b> show is largely similar to the one they used to perform for the republican troops. Musical numbers are followed by a poem, now read by the lieutenant. The third act involves a comic sketch, [...] "The Republic goes to the Doctor". In this simplistic parody, Paulino plays a gay republican doctor who is visited by a female patient, the Spanish Republic, played by Carmela. She claims that she has been made pregnant by a Russian lover, played by Gustavete. In a number which gives full scope to all the possible sexual innuendos the audience cares to imagine, Carmela invites the doctor to insert his thermometer in her, to which he refuses, making the excuse that it is broken. Carmela, increasingly irritated by the mockery of the Republic and enervated by the presence of the Polish soldiers, gradually loses heart in her performance, and her frustration at the mockery of the ideals she holds dear seethes to the surface jeopardizing the credibility of the parody. The sketch quickly disintegrates as the Polish soldiers begin to rebel in the galleries and the fascists become infuriated. The scene comes to a climax as Carmela starts singing 'Ay Carmela' and <b>lowers</b> <b>the</b> republican <b>flag</b> <b>to</b> expose her breasts in defiance of the earlier cries of 'Whore!' from the audience. A nationalist officer then emerges from the stalls, raises a pistol and shoots Carmela in the forehead.
