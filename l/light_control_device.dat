40|$|With {{the growing}} need to {{conserve}} energy, {{more people are}} becoming conscious of energy consumption and {{are looking for ways}} to reduce costly waste associated with electricity. Though most consumers do not think about lighting until the light bulb fails or the power goes out, expenses incurred due to lighting have been found to be a large part of overall energy consumption and lighting has now become the focus of efforts aimed at reducing the high cost of electricity. The purpose of our project is to design an Automatic <b>Light</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Device</b> (ALCD) to help curb the high cost of internal lighting while creating a convenient effortlessly lighted environment for the consumer. Today, energy saving devices, such as occupancy or motion sensors, is used by a multiple of people for the conservation of power. Motion detectors cause lights to turn on after entering the room and off after no movement is detected for a certain amount of time. This unit is efficient; however, energy is loss due to the presence and absence of movement in a particular room by the sensor continuously activating on or off. Unneeded cycling uses more power and defeats the intended purpose of saving energy. The ALCD will save energy by eliminating false conditions, thereby minimizing ligh...|$|E

Under time reversal, a laser emitting coherent light becomes a ‘coherent perfect absorber’, as recently demonstrated in a bulk optical cavity device that can absorb all radiation incident upon it [Science 331, 889 (2011) ].

Data obtained included age, gender, consangunity, visual acuity, visual fields, ocular conditions causing low vision and types of low-vision devices and methods prescribed. Results: Two hundred and ninety seven (72 &#x 0025;) of 450 patients were male. One-fifth were in the 11 - 20 years age group (21 &#x 0025;). Visual acuity in the better eye was &#x 0026;lt; 6 / 18 - 6 / 60 in almost half these patients (49. 3 &#x 0025;). One hundred and twenty two patients (29. 9 &#x 0025;) referred with a visual acuity of &#x 0026;# 8805; 6 / 18, either had difficulty in reading normal print or had restricted visual fields. The main causes for low vision were: retinitis pigmentosa (19 &#x 0025;), diabetic retinopathy (13 &#x 0025;), Macular diseases (17. 7 &#x 0025;), and degenerative myopia (9 &#x 0025;).
