40|$|Yorkville Dam {{is located}} on the Fox River in Yorkville, Illinois. It is a low {{overflow}} smcture (approximately 6 feet hgh) with a 530 ft wide modified ogee crest. Completion of the dam in 1961 did not include any riverbed protection below the dam. As time went on, the flow plunging down the face of the spillway, as well as the turbulent forces generated by a hydraulic jump, eroded away the original bed material and created a large scour hole. The advent of this scour hole caused the hydraulic jump to become submerged for all tailwater depths and changed the hydraulic behavior of the structure because the submerged hydraulic jump was not able to dissipate the excess energy {{in the same manner as}} a normal hydraulic jump would. The mechanism by which a submerged hydraulic jump dissipates excess energy is through the formation of a roller. The unrelenting forces of this roller have captured many unwilling victims, and caused many drowning deaths at Yorkville Dam. In 1977, the Division of Water Resources of the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) attempted to remedy the situation. They placed <b>large</b> <b>riprap</b> inside the scour hole having equivalent diameters of up to 2 ft. After sometime, it appeared that the riprap remediation had no...|$|E

50|$|In August and September 2011, Oxbow Creek {{experienced}} significant flooding, {{which caused}} streambank erosion. To protect against such occurrences in the future, <b>large</b> rocks of <b>riprap</b> were installed along that {{reach of the}} creek.|$|R
5000|$|Geotextiles were {{originally}} intended to be an alternative to granular soil filters. The original, and still sometimes used, term for geotextiles is filter fabrics. Work originally began in the 1950s with R.J. Barrett using geotextiles behind precast concrete seawalls, under precast concrete erosion control blocks, beneath <b>large</b> stone <b>riprap,</b> and in other erosion control situations. [...] He used different styles of woven monofilament fabrics, all characterized by a relatively high percentage open area (varying from 6 to 30%). He discussed the need for both adequate permeability and soil retention, along with adequate fabric strength and proper elongation and {{set the tone for}} geotextile use in filtration situations.|$|R
50|$|Located {{upstream}} from Spanish Banks waterfront, {{one of the}} highest profile creeks in Vancouver Metro became open to salmon in 2000. In a collaborative project between Spanish Banks Streamkeepers Association and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada, barriers to fish passage were removed and habitat structure was added. Spanish Banks Creek was previously diverted through a culvert underneath a parking lot, but the lower reaches of this creek have been revitalized. The banks were stabilized with <b>riprap,</b> <b>large</b> woody debris was added for habitat cover, and spawning gravels were added in appropriate areas. Rigorous effectiveness monitoring has not been performed, but a few dozen coho and chum salmon are known to spawn there annually in a sustaining population. Maintenance to the creek is provided by Spanish Banks Streamkeepers Association, a local volunteer stewardship group.|$|R
40|$|The Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) in {{conjunction}} with the Saint Anthony Falls Laboratory (SAFL) has conducted a research study on the use of matrix riprap, or partially grouted riprap, as a spill-through abutment countermeasure. Spill-through abutments at river bridges require a countermeasure to protect the abutment from erosion and scour and often riprap is used. However obtaining large enough stone to protect the abutment can significantly increase construction costs. Matrix riprap, or partially grouted riprap, is an option that will allow for smaller stone, that when partially grouted, will provide equivalent protection to <b>larger</b> sized <b>riprap.</b> This study focused on matrix riprap applied to bridge abutments and included a review of published literature; site visits and observation of matrix riprap installation; laboratory experiments to evaluate matrix riprap application/installation (e. g., non-hydraulic experiments looking at rock and grout placement); experiments to test matrix riprap on a prototype abutment within a flume (hydraulic flume experiments), and finally hydraulic experiments focused on quantifying matrix riprap strength (steep flume experiments). Study results showed that the shear strength of matrix riprap was determined to be more than three times greater than conventional riprap in a laboratory setting. Additional investigation should be completed to better understand the application and performance of the matrix riprap, however this study can be used to support the use of matrix riprap in place of larger stone or other bridge countermeasures...|$|R
40|$|World Congress of Malacology, Ponta Delgada, July 22 - 28, 2013. The {{number of}} {{anthropogenic}} structures deployed in coastal areas has increased markedly {{in recent times}} and many studies have now shown that these structures seldom mimic the natural habitais they replace. To date, however, most such {{studies have focused on}} the numbers and relative abundance of species and little is known about how these structures affect the patterns of species aggregation and size structure, despite the fact that variations in these parameters may have important ecological consequences at population and community levels. Here we compare the relative abundance, patterns of aggregation and size structure of two high shore gastropod littorinids (Tectarius striatus and Melarhaphe neritoides) on riprap and adjacent rocky shores. While the relative abundance of T. striatus was similar on riprap and natural rocky shores, M. neritoides was significantly more abundant on rocky shores. At small spatial scales (cm’s) both littorinids specics showed more aggregated distributions on <b>riprap.</b> At <b>larger</b> scales (cm’s), both littorinids were also more aggregated on riprap although this was only significant for T. striatus. Habitat type influenced the size structure whith both species attaining a significantly <b>larger</b> size on <b>riprap.</b> Here we add to the wider literature by showing that anthropogenic structures can affect intertidal assemblages in ways other than richness or the relative abundance of organisms alone. The here documented variation in patterns of aggregation and size structure between habitats likely influence the population dynamics of these species and may have wider community level consequences...|$|R
40|$|The Uncompahgre River in Ouray, CO, was {{modified}} in 1996 from a braided river {{system to a}} meandering river channel. <b>Large</b> boulders of <b>riprap</b> were placed along designed meanders to prevent erosion and enable the development of permanent human structures on the flood plain. Deposition of gravel bars in the modified channel occurs annually during the summer. This gravel is "mined" by the City of Ouray; however, {{the effects of this}} excavation and the original modification were never assessed. This study provides an assessment by quantifying cross-sectional area change, cumulative grain-size distributions, shear stresses, slopes, and sinuosities using traditional survey methods. In addition, volume change of a gravel bar inside the modified channel was estimated using extreme oblique photographs (> 45 degrees from nadir) that were obtained from nearby cliffs. Close-range photogrammetry was used in the natural channel downstream to evaluate photogrammetric methods using different lenses, image sensors, and camera geometries. Both traditional and photogrammetric methods clearly indicated significant deposition in the modified channel, whereas erosion occurred directly downstream from the modified channel, but did not occur at a reach 1. 5 km downstream. In the natural channel, no cross-sectional area change occurred, grains were poorly sorted, and the longitudinal slope was ~four times steeper than the modified channel. Shear stress ratios were used as an erosion threshold, which did not correlate with actual cross-sectional area change, but a decrease in shear stress ratios from May 2011 to September 2011 were associated with erosion. Average RMSE values for DEMs created from extremeoblique photographs of a gravel bar in May 2011 and September 2011 were 0. 140 m and 0. 324 m, respectively. Using a DEM of difference with a t-statistic filter revealed that 115 m 3 of gravel was deposited. The Uncompahgre River showed similar geomorphic characteristics to other rivers in southwest Colorado, however, the slope of the natural and modified channels were much steeper than other rivers. Extreme-oblique photography and unconventional sensors both yielded reliable results, showing that these atypical techniques can be used in terrestrial photogrammetric applications such as, post-restoration assessments, as long as proper base-to-height ratios are achieved...|$|R
