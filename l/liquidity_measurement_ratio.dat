40|$|The JSE Equity Market {{has evolved}} {{significantly}} since floor trading ended in 1996. Fast and efficient trading technology {{is attractive to}} market participants based not only locally but internationally as well. How quick and cost effectively a trader can enter and exit a market {{plays a significant role}} in defining a market place’s liquidity. Liquidity is multidimensional, making it not only difficult to isolate a particular dimension but also challenging to fully measure, according to Liu (2006). Growth in trading activity following each trading engine upgrade in the JSE Equity Market has been quite evident. The microstructure changes, such as low latency trading that came about because of the technological enhancement and the plethora of academic research concerning high speed trading and liquidity, begged the question as to whether there was a trend regarding the exchange’s liquidity. It also questioned whether all liquidity was the same and whether it truly was as multidimensional as some authors have suggested. The purpose of this study was, using different <b>liquidity</b> <b>measurements</b> and methodologies, to determine whether liquidity improved or diminished during an eight-year period from 2 July 2005 to 1 July 2013. An ANOVA analysis was done using each <b>liquidity</b> <b>measurement’s</b> results to determine differentiation between each July-to-July year and ascertain whether the liquidity was affected particularly after the implementation of the JSE’s latest trading engine upgrade. The study also aimed to determine whether these <b>liquidity</b> <b>measurements</b> <b>liquidity</b> rankings were in any way connected to each other using correlation. Thirdly, a portfolio event study was conducted to gauge whether the impact on liquidity due to the JSE’s 2012 trading engine upgrade, was statistically significant. Lastly, the aforementioned <b>liquidity</b> <b>measurements</b> which had shown changes in liquidity that were statistically significant were compared to the activity of low latency trading strategies on the JSE. Overall, the results were varied and not fully conclusive to show a positive relationship between the trading engine upgrade, low latency trading and liquidity...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} research within empirical {{financial economics}} with focus on liquidity and portfolio optimisation {{in the stock}} market. The discussion on liquidity is focused on measurement issues, including TAQ data processing and <b>measurement</b> of systematic <b>liquidity</b> factors (FSO). Furthermore, a framework for treatment of the two topics in combination is provided. The liquidity part of the thesis gives a conceptual background to liquidity and discusses several different approaches to <b>liquidity</b> <b>measurement.</b> It contributes to <b>liquidity</b> <b>measurement</b> by providing detailed guidelines on the data processing needed for applying TAQ data to liquidity research. The main focus, however, is the derivation of systematic liquidity factors. The principal component approach to systematic <b>liquidity</b> <b>measurement</b> is refined {{by the introduction of}} moving and expanding estimation windows, allowing for time-varying liquidity co-variances between stocks. Under several liability specifications, this improves the ability to explain stock liquidity and returns, as compared to static window PCA and market average approximations of systematic liquidity. The highest ability to explain stock returns is obtained when using inventory cost as a liquidity measure and a moving window PCA as the systematic liquidity derivation technique. Systematic factors of this setting also have a strong ability in explaining a cross-sectional liquidity variation. Portfolio optimisation in the FSO framework is tested in two empirical studies. These contribute to the assessment of FSO by expanding the applicability to stock indexes and individual stocks, by considering a wide selection of utility function specifications, and by showing explicitly how the full-scale optimum can be identified using either grid search or the heuristic search algorithm of differential evolution. The studies show that relative to mean-variance portfolios, FSO performs well in these settings and that the computational expense can be mitigated dramatically by application of differential evolution.

40|$|Variations {{in overall}} {{liquidity}} {{can be measured}} by simultaneous changes in both immediacy costs and depth. Liquidity changes, however, are ambiguous whenever both liquidity dimensions do not reinforce each other. In this paper, ambiguity is characterized using an instantaneous time-varying elasticity concept. Several bi-dimensional liquidity measures that cope with the ambiguity problem are constructed. First, it is shown that bi-dimensional measures are superior since commonalities in overall liquidity cannot be fully explained by the common factors in one-dimensional proxies of liquidity. Second, it is shown that an infinitesimal variation in either market volatility or trading activity augments the probability of observing an unambiguous liquidity adjustment. Ambiguity strongly depends on the expected (deterministic) component of volatility. <b>liquidity,</b> <b>measurement,</b> immediacy, depth, elasticity, ambiguity, bi-dimensional,...|$|R

The relative size of the liquidity factor loadings of the different hedge fund indices is generally consistent with the liquidity sensitivities of the underlying strategies.

METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging from 56 Griffon Bruxellois dogs was assessed for Chiari-like malformation and cerebrospinal fluid pathway abnormalities. Skull radiographs were obtained in 33 dogs. Two rostrocaudal and two ventrodorsal measurements were made, and ratios of one length to another were compared. RESULTS: In this selected sample, 60. 7 per cent had Chiari-like malformation. Syringomyelia occurred with and without Chiari-like malformation (37. 5 and 8. 9 per cent study population, respectively).

The <b>measurement</b> of market <b>liquidity</b> has been especially important for emerging markets as they are exposed to the flow of short term investment fund. We follow the <b>liquidity</b> <b>measurement</b> approach by Bervas (2006) and a combination of Value at Risk (VaR) and Liquidity-adjusted Value at Risk developed by Bangia, et al (1999) and produce the measurement of exogenous cost of liquidity (CoL) from the Indonesian stock market. The paper sheds light on the possibility of the use of this liquidity risk measure as part of the financial stability analysis. We also forecasted the value of CoL to see if it can be used as an early warning indicator. The results shows that especially for the series during the final quarter of 2008, the movement of the forecasted values can predict whether the liquidity risk will be worse. However, the magnitude of the forecasted increase of CoL undervalued the real increase of CoL. The forecast in the second semester of 2009 is roughly similar to the actual measurement as it is considered a more normal period.
