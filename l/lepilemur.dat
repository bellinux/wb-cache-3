5|$|Fork-marked lemurs {{were first}} {{documented}} in 1839 by Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville when {{he described the}} Masoala fork-marked lemur (P.furcifer) as Lemur furcifer. The holotype {{is thought to be}} MNHN1834-136, a female specimen taken from Madagascar by French naturalist Justin Goudot. The source of this specimen is unknown, but thought to be Antongil Bay. In 1850, Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire moved the fork-marked lemurs to the genus Cheirogaleus (dwarf lemurs), but they were also commonly listed in the genus Microcebus (mouse lemurs). In 1870, John Edward Gray assigned fork-marked lemurs to their own genus, Phaner, after initially including them and the mouse lemurs in the genus <b>Lepilemur</b> (sportive lemurs). Although French naturalist Alfred Grandidier accepted Gray's new genus (while also lumping the other cheirogaleids in Cheirogaleus and illustrating the cranial similarities between cheirogaleids and <b>Lepilemur)</b> in 1897, the genus Phaner was not widely accepted. In the early 1930s, Ernst Schwarz, Guillaume Grandidier, and others resurrected the name, citing characteristics that were intermediate between Cheirogaleus and Microcebus.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{studies using}} morphology, immunology, {{repetitive}} DNA, SINE analysis, multilocus phylogenetic tests, and mitochondrial genes (mtDNA), giant mouse lemurs are most {{closely related to}} mouse lemurs within the family Cheirogaleidae, and together they form a clade with the hairy-eared dwarf lemur (Allocebus). Both dwarf lemurs and fork-marked lemurs are more distantly related, with fork-marked lemurs being either a sister group of all cheirogaleids, or {{more closely related to}} sportive lemurs (<b>Lepilemur).</b>|$|E
5|$|Crypsis, or the {{inability}} of humans to visually distinguish between two or more distinct species, has recently been discovered among lemurs, particularly within the sportive lemurs (<b>Lepilemur)</b> and mouse lemurs (Microcebus). With sportive lemurs, subspecies were traditionally defined based on slight morphological differences, but new genetic evidence has supported giving full species status to these regional populations. In the case of mouse lemurs, the gray mouse lemur (M. murinus), golden-brown mouse lemur (M. ravelobensis), and Goodman's mouse lemur (M. lehilahytsara) were considered the same species until recently, when genetic tests identified them as cryptic species.|$|E
50|$|Measuring 19-27 cm in {{body length}} with a tail about 16-17 cm, they {{are larger than}} the mouse lemur but smaller than the gentle lemur. Their heads are {{globular}} compared to the fox-like heads of the lemurs, but their muzzles are more pointed {{than those of the}} hapalemurs. Their hind limbs are slightly longer than their forelimbs, but not as elongated as in <b>lepilemurs</b> or indriids. Dwarf lemurs have an intermembral index of 71 on average. In contrast to most other primates, their grip {{is similar to that of}} South American monkeys with objects picked up and branches grasped between the second and third fingers, rather than between the thumb and index finger. Their nails are somewhat keeled and pointed.|$|R
5|$|Many of {{the larger}} lemur species consume leaves (folivory), {{particularly}} the indriids. However, some smaller lemurs such as sportive lemurs (genus <b>Lepilemur)</b> and woolly lemurs (genus Avahi) also primarily eat leaves, making them the smallest primates that do so. The smallest of the lemurs generally do not eat much leaf matter. Collectively, lemurs have been documented consuming leaves from at least 82 native plant families and 15 alien plant families. Lemurs tend to be selective in their consumption of {{the part of the}} leaf or shoot as well as its age. Often, young leaves are preferred over mature leaves.|$|E
5|$|Bark {{and plant}} exudates such as tree sap are {{consumed}} {{by a few}} lemur species. The exploitation of exudates {{has been reported in}} 18 plant species and only in the dry regions in the south and west of Madagascar. Only the Masoala fork-marked lemur (Phaner furcifer) and Coquerel's giant mouse lemur regularly consume tree sap. Bark has never been reported as an important food item in lemur diets, but at least four species eat it: the aye-aye, the red-tailed sportive lemur (<b>Lepilemur</b> ruficaudatus), the common brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus), and Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi). Most bark feeding is directly linked to exudate feeding, except for the aye-aye's bark feeding on Afzelia bijuga (genus Afzelia) at Nosy Mangabe in the northeast.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{have low}} basal {{metabolic}} rates (BMR), which helps them to conserve energy {{during the dry}} season, when water and food are scarce. They can optimize their energy use by lowering their metabolic rate to 20% below the values predicted for mammals of similar body mass. The red-tailed sportive lemur (<b>Lepilemur</b> ruficaudatus), for instance, reportedly {{has one of the}} lowest metabolic rates among mammals. Its low metabolic rate may be linked to its generally folivorous diet and relatively small body mass. Lemurs exhibit behavioral adaptations to complement this trait, including sunning behaviors, hunched sitting, group huddling, and nest sharing, in order to reduce heat loss and conserve energy. Dwarf lemurs and mouse lemurs exhibit seasonal cycles of dormancy to conserve energy. Before dry season, they will accumulate fat in white adipose tissue located {{at the base of the}} tail and hind legs, doubling their weight. At the end of the dry season, their body mass may fall to half of what it was prior to the dry season. Lemurs that do not experience states of dormancy are also able to shut down aspects of their metabolism for energy conservation.|$|E
500|$|By far {{the most}} {{explosive}} growth in species numbers (in absolute terms) {{has been in the}} genera Microcebus and <b>Lepilemur.</b> In 2006, 15new species of <b>Lepilemur</b> were described, with three new species reported in February, one in June, and 11 in September. [...] Since then, three additional species have been described, one of {{which turned out to be}} identical to a previously described species. Genetic and morphological differences seem to suggest that they are cryptic species, but there is still debate whether these merit full species status or should be regarded as subspecies of previously identified, [...] "core" [...] species.|$|E
500|$|The small-toothed {{sportive}} lemur (<b>Lepilemur</b> microdon), or small-toothed weasel lemur, is a primate {{species in}} the family Lepilemuridae that—like all lemurs—is endemic to Madagascar. [...] The species lives in dense rainforest in southeastern Madagascar, {{and can be found}} in Ranomafana and Andringitra National Parks. [...] Described in 1894, it was considered either a subspecies or taxonomic synonym of the weasel sportive lemur (<b>Lepilemur</b> mustelinus) throughout most of the 20th century. [...] Phylogenetic studies not only support its species status, but also suggest that it is the only eastern Malagasy sportive lemur that is more closely related to western than to other eastern species.|$|E
500|$|The small-toothed {{sportive}} lemur or small-toothed weasel lemur, {{a member}} of the sportive lemur genus (<b>Lepilemur),</b> was first described in 1894 by Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major, based on a specimen found in the Ankafana Forest in the eastern districts of the former Betsileo province in central Madagascar. [...] Although Forsyth Major did not explicitly state the origins of either the scientific name or the vernacular name, he did note that it had smaller molar teeth relative to other sportive lemurs. [...] The species name microdon is derived from the Ancient Greek micro-, meaning [...] "small" [...] and -odon, meaning [...] "tooth." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2006, Edward E. Louis, Jr., etal. {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} 11new species of sportive lemur based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data. [...] Each new species resulted from the splitting of existing species. [...] In {{the case of the}} small-toothed sportive lemur, the population at Kalambatritra Reserve became known as Wright's sportive lemur (<b>Lepilemur</b> wrightae), the population as Andohahela National Park became Fleurete's sportive lemur (L.fleuretae), the population in Fandriana became Betsileo sportive lemur (L.betsileo), and the population at Manombo Reserve became James' sportive lemur (L.jamesorum). [...] The small-toothed sportive lemur remains a distinct species, while even more species have since been described, though none within its range.|$|E
500|$|Until the 1990s, {{there was}} some dispute over the taxonomic status of the species. [...] For much of the 20th century, the small-toothed {{sportive}} lemur was considered a subspecies of the weasel sportive lemur (<b>Lepilemur</b> mustelinus). [...] In his book The Primates of Madagascar from 1982, primatologist Ian Tattersall deviated from the traditional view by considering L.microdon a synonym of the weasel sportive lemur, while also recognizing only a single species of sportive lemur. [...] Tattersall based his decision on what he {{considered to be a}} lack of detailed anatomical studies and field surveys, while also factoring in the difficulty in observing the animals in the wild, the presence of only subtle variations among museum specimens, and his own unwillingness to consider differences in karyotypes as grounds for defining distinct species. [...] However, primatologist Russell Mittermeier, etal. in Lemurs of Madagascar (1994), taxonomist Colin Groves in Mammal Species of the World (2005), and others favored recognizing the small-toothed sportive lemur as a species while also recognizing a total of seven sportive lemur species.|$|E
500|$|Between 2006 and 2009, {{three studies}} were {{published}} {{to resolve the}} phylogenetic relationships between the sportive lemurs. [...] Cytogenetic and molecular studies in 2006 and 2008 concluded that the small-toothed sportive lemur is most {{closely related to the}} Milne-Edwards' sportive lemur (<b>Lepilemur</b> edwardsi). [...] In 2009, a study examined every known species, including the species most recently described, using two pieces of mtDNA: the D-loop and an array of genes known as the PAST fragment. [...] The resulting data placed the sportive lemurs into four groups: Section A from northern and northwestern Madagascar, section B from northwestern Madagascar, section C from west central and southern Madagascar, and section D from eastern Madagascar. [...] Only the small-toothed sportive lemur generated conflicting results when comparing the results between the mtDNA and D-loop data. [...] The PAST data placed it in section B, while the D-loop data placed it in section C. [...] The relationship between the small-toothed sportive lemur, an eastern Malagasy species, and a group of species from the west coast of Madagascar suggests that the ancestral population of the small-toothed sportive lemur dispersed to its current range from western Madagascar using river corridors. However, the conflicting data about the relationship of the small-toothed sportive lemur to either section B or section C render the precise dispersal route uncertain.|$|E
500|$|Lemurs are {{threatened}} {{by a host of}} environmental problems, including deforestation, hunting for bushmeat, live capture for the exotic pet trade, and climate change. All species are listed by CITES on Appendix I, which prohibits trade of specimens or parts, except for scientific purposes. As of 2005, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) listed 16% of all lemur species as critically endangered, 23% as endangered, 25% as vulnerable, 28% as [...] "data deficient", and only 8% as least concern. Over the next five years, at least 28species were newly identified, none of which have had their conservation status assessed. Many are likely to be considered threatened since the new lemur species that have been described recently are typically confined to small regions. Given the rate of continued habitat destruction, undiscovered species could go extinct before being identified. Since the arrival of humans on the island approximately 2000years ago, all endemic Malagasy vertebrates over 10kg (22lb) have disappeared, including 17species, 8genera, and 3families of lemurs. The IUCN Species Survival Commission (IUCN/SSC), the International Primatological Society (IPS), and Conservation International (CI) have included as many as five lemurs in their biennial [...] "Top 25 Most Endangered Primates". The 2008–2010 list includes the greater bamboo lemur, gray-headed lemur (Eulemur cinereiceps), blue-eyed black lemur (Eulemur flavifrons), northern sportive lemur (<b>Lepilemur</b> septentrionalis), and silky sifaka. In 2012, an assessment by the Primate Specialist Group of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) concluded that 90% of the then 103described species of lemur should be listed as threatened on the IUCN Red List, making lemurs the most endangered group of mammals. The IUCN reiterated its concern in 2013, noting that 90% of all lemur species could be extinct within 20 to 25years unless a $7million USD 3-year conservation plan aimed at helping local communities can be implemented.|$|E

5000|$|French {{zoologist}} Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire {{first described}} the genus <b>Lepilemur</b> in 1851, prefixing the existing genus Lemur with the Latin lepidus ("pleasant" [...] or [...] "pretty"). However, it was erroneously spelled—a mistake later authors unsuccessfully attempted to correct to Lepidolemur. Members of the monogeneric family Lepilemuridae {{are referred to}} as either sportive or weasel lemurs. [...] "Sportive lemur", which is more commonly used, was coined by Henry Ogg Forbes in 1894.
