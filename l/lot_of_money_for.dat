Against expectations, the Australians managed to draw the series 22 against an England team filled with Test cricketers.

By the time the team arrived in Australia they were extremely tired and their performances deteriorated, leading analysts who had not seen them in England to regard them as a weak team.|$|E

DeMille. In the early 1690s, he staged the three real operas of the Restoration spectacular genre, or the shows usually so designated: Dioclesian (1689–90) by Massinger/Fletcher/Betterton; King Arthur (1690–91) by John Dryden; and The Fairy-Queen (1691–92), adapted from Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream by perhaps Elkanah Settle, all of them graced by music by Henry Purcell, and together perhaps a sign of the coming 18th-century vogue for Italian opera. The lavish variety entertainment Dioclesian, adapted by Betterton, with many monsters, dragons, and machines, from [...] Massinger and Fletcher's History of Dioclesian, was very popular throughout the 1690s and made a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> the United Company.

500|$|In 1947, Grant {{played an}} artist who becomes {{involved}} in a court case when charged with assault in The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer, opposite Myrna Loy and Shirley Temple. The film was praised by the critics, who admired the picture's slapstick qualities and chemistry between Grant and Loy; it {{became one of the}} biggest-selling films at the box office that year. Later that year he starred opposite David Niven and Loretta Young in the comedy The Bishop's Wife, playing an angel who is sent down from heaven to straighten out the relationship between the bishop (Niven) and his wife (Loretta Young). The film was a major commercial and critical success, and was nominated for five Academy Awards. Life magazine called it [...] "intelligently written and competently acted". The following year, Grant played neurotic Jim Blandings, the title-sake in the comedy Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House, again with Loy. Though the film picture lost a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> RKO, Philip T. Hartung of Commonweal thought that Grant's role as the [...] "frustrated advertising man" [...] was one of his best screen portrayals. In Every Girl Should Be Married, an [...] "airy comedy", he appeared with Betsy Drake and Franchot Tone, playing a bachelor who is trapped into marriage by Drake's conniving character. He finished the year as the fourth most popular film star at the box office.|$|E

After DuBose's camera went through three reels of photos, Johnny insisted that was enough, to which DuBose replied that the record company was paying him a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> the shoot, so they should make it worth while. The photo session, however, only lasted about ten to fifteen minutes, and was done in a poorly lit area, which Johnny said was [...] "pretty good not to make us look old, and it was getting harder and harder." [...] The back cover photograph was also shot by DuBose, which features green tombstones in a Jewish cemetery.
