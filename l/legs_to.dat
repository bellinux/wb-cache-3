5|$|Because {{the worker}} and soldier castes lack wings and thus never fly, and the reproductives use their wings {{for just a}} brief amount of time, {{termites}} predominantly rely upon their <b>legs</b> <b>to</b> move about.|$|E
5|$|The Ancient Egyptians {{believed}} that bee-eaters had medical properties, prescribing {{the application of}} bee-eater fat to deter biting flies, and treating the eyes with the smoke from charred bee-eater <b>legs</b> <b>to</b> cure an unspecified female complaint.|$|E
5|$|The greater yellow-headed vulture {{also has}} the unusual habit of urohidrosis, in which it urinates or defecates on its <b>legs</b> <b>to</b> cool them evaporatively. This {{behavior}} is exhibited by storks and New World vultures.|$|E

50|$|Epiphysiodesis is a {{pediatric}} surgical procedure {{in which the}} epiphyseal (growth) plate of a bone is fused either temporarily or permanently to delay growth of a long bone. This procedure {{is often used to}} slow or halt the growth of a morphologically normal <b>leg</b> <b>to</b> allow a shorter <b>leg</b> <b>to</b> grow to a matching length.|$|R

5|$|After the rut, females form large {{herds of}} up to 50 individuals. Newborn calves are kept close {{by a series of}} vocalizations; larger {{nurseries}} have an ongoing and constant chatter during the daytime hours. When approached by predators, the largest and most robust females may make a stand, using their front <b>legs</b> <b>to</b> kick at their attackers. Guttural grunts and posturing effectively deter all but the most determined predators.|$|E
5|$|Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly {{preying on}} insects, on other spiders, {{and on other}} arthropods. The most common {{procedure}} is sighting the prey, stalking, fastening a silk safety line to the surface, using the two pairs of back <b>legs</b> <b>to</b> jump on the victim, and finally biting the prey. Most jumping spiders walk throughout the day, so that they maximize their chances of a catch.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} forms of climbing, bouldering {{technique}} is largely centered on proper footwork. Leg muscles are significantly stronger than arm muscles; thus, proficient boulderers use their arms primarily to maintain balance and body positioning, relying on their <b>legs</b> <b>to</b> push them up the boulder. Boulderers also keep their arms straight whenever possible, allowing their bones to support their body weight rather than their muscles.|$|E

5|$|For its {{transition}} to Rougarou, the ride received three new floorless trains which allows riders' <b>legs</b> <b>to</b> dangle freely above the track, {{as there is}} no floor between rows. Each has the same 32-rider configuration as the previous trains on Mantis. Riders are also secured by an over-the-shoulder harness with an interlocking seatbelt.|$|E
5|$|New Guinea {{crocodiles}} have {{a mostly}} aquatic lifestyle and are largely nocturnal. They {{spend much of}} the day underwater, often with their nostrils and eyes above the surface. Powerful side-to-side movements of their tails propel them through the water and they use both tail and <b>legs</b> <b>to</b> steer. When on land, they favour shady, dense areas of undergrowth. They tend to bask in a group during the day, dispersing at night to feed.|$|E
5|$|These {{earliest}} tetrapods {{were not}} terrestrial. The earliest confirmed terrestrial forms are {{known from the}} early Carboniferous deposits, some 20 million years later. Still, they may have spent very brief periods out of water and would have used their <b>legs</b> <b>to</b> paw {{their way through the}} mud.|$|E

5|$|Turning Point {{is remembered}} for the {{disbanding}} of Triple X and for Elix Skipper pulling Chris Harris {{off the top}} of a cage with his <b>legs</b> <b>to</b> perform a move he named the New School. The PPV was also the final televised match of Randy Savage's career. The professional wrestling section of the Canadian Online Explorer website rated the event a 7 out of 10, which was the same as the 2005 event's rating.|$|E
5|$|A full-grown Scelidosaurus {{was rather}} small {{compared}} to most later non-avian dinosaurs, {{but it was a}} medium-sized species in the Early Jurassic. Some scientists have estimated a length of 4metres (13ft). In 2010, Gregory S. Paul gave a body length of 3.8 metres (12.5ft) and a weight of 270 kilogrammes. Scelidosaurus was quadrupedal, with the hindlimbs longer than the forelimbs. It may have reared up on its hind <b>legs</b> <b>to</b> browse on foliage from trees, but its arms were relatively long, indicating a mostly quadrupedal posture. A trackway from the Holy Cross Mountains of Poland shows a scelidosaur like animal walking in a bipedal manner, hinting that Scelidosaurus may have been more proficient at bipedalism than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|Adult dragonflies hunt on {{the wing}} using their {{exceptionally}} acute eyesight and strong, agile flight. They are almost exclusively carnivorous, eating {{a wide variety of}} insects ranging from small midges and mosquitoes to butterflies, moths, damselflies, and smaller dragonflies. A large prey item is subdued by being bitten on the head and is carried by the <b>legs</b> <b>to</b> a perch. Here, the wings are discarded and the prey usually ingested head first. A dragonfly may consume as much as a fifth of its body weight in prey per day.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{wound up}} being {{faithful}} to the comics, many designs were made for Spider-Man's costumes: one concept costume designer James Acheson became fond {{of the idea of}} having a red emblem over a black costume. Another, which would eventually lead to the final product, featured an enlarged logo on the chest and red stripes going down the sides of the <b>legs.</b> <b>To</b> create Spider-Man's costume, Maguire was fitted for the skintight suit, being covered with layers of substance to create the suit's shape. It was designed as a single piece, except for the mask. The webbing, which accented the costume, was cut by computer. The mask eye lenses were designed to have a mirror look.|$|E
5|$|Because {{it is both}} one of {{the first}} dinosaurs {{described}} and one of the best-known dinosaurs, Iguanodon has been well-placed as a barometer of changing public and scientific perceptions on dinosaurs. Its reconstructions have gone through three stages: the elephantine quadrupedal horn-snouted reptile satisfied the Victorians, then a bipedal but still fundamentally reptilian animal using its tail to prop itself up dominated the early 20th century, but was slowly overturned during the 1960s by its current, more agile and dynamic representation, able to shift from two <b>legs</b> <b>to</b> all fours.|$|E
5|$|Brachiosaurus is {{the first}} dinosaur seen by the park's visitors. It is inaccurately {{depicted}} as chewing its food, and standing up on its hind <b>legs</b> <b>to</b> browse among the high tree branches. According to artist Andy Schoneberg, the chewing was done to make the animal seem docile, {{in a way it}} resembled a cow chewing its cud. The dinosaur's head and upper neck was the largest puppet without hydraulics built for the film. Despite scientific evidence of their having limited vocal capabilities, sound designer Gary Rydstrom decided to represent them with whale songs and donkey calls to give them a melodic sense of wonder. Penguins were also recorded {{to be used in the}} noises of the dinosaurs.|$|E

5|$|Gonopods {{occur in}} a {{diversity}} of shapes and sizes, and {{in the range from}} closely resembling walking <b>legs</b> <b>to</b> complex structures quite unlike legs at all. In some groups, the gonopods are kept retracted within the body; in others they project forward parallel to the body. Gonopod morphology is the predominant means of determining species among millipedes: the structures may differ greatly between closely related species but very little within a species. The gonopods develop gradually from walking legs through successive moults until reproductive maturity.|$|E
5|$|Griffon {{operates}} {{with three}} steel and fiberglass trains, colored red, yellow, and black. Each train has three rows that seat ten riders across {{for a total}} of 30 riders per train; each seat has its own individual over-the-shoulder restraint with a seatbelt. This configuration allows the ride to achieve a theoretical hourly capacity of 1,400 riders per hour. Unlike traditional roller coasters, Griffon's trains are floorless, allowing the riders' <b>legs</b> <b>to</b> dangle throughout the ride. Riders also experience up to 4 times the force of gravity.|$|E
5|$|Harvestmen {{are among}} the {{minority}} of living chelicerates that can take solid food, and the group includes predators, herbivores and scavengers. Horseshoe crabs are also capable of processing solid food, and use a distinctive feeding system. Claws at the tips of their legs grab small invertebrates and pass them to a food groove that runs from between the rearmost <b>legs</b> <b>to</b> the mouth, {{which is on the}} underside of the head and faces slightly backwards. The bases of the legs form toothed gnathobases that both grind the food and push it towards the mouth. This is how the earliest arthropods are thought to have fed.|$|E
