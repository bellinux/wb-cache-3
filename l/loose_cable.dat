Joe discusses his previous life experiences with her, before attempting to traverse the ski lift cable, and onto a support pole on the other side. By doing this, he also causes the chair Parker is sitting in to dangerously loosen from the cable. After scaring off a pair of wolves by using a ski pole, he slides down the mountain on Parker's snowboard, planning to return with help. The wolves give chase after him.

Just as Wallace corners her, she sprays a fire extinguisher into his face, knocking him over and leaving him hanging onto a <b>loose</b> <b>cable.</b> After the cable is severed and the killer falls, Alicia makes her way to the door, but Wallace attacks again. She dumps a burning bin onto him, igniting him, then escapes the theater and tells the police about the events. The next morning, Alicia returns to the theater to find her missing watch, just before an unmasked Wallace prepares to attack her. Willy shoots him in the head and he rambles about getting him [...] "right in-between in the eyes" [...] while a disturbed Alicia walks out.

50|$|Meanwhile, as Cotford and {{a handful}} of {{officers}} take Mina back for questioning, they are overcome by an eerie red fog and one by one officers are picked off by Bathory, who {{is in the form of}} a gargoyle. Realizing that Van Helsing's earlier rants about the supernatural were real after all, Cotford attempts to save Mina by getting her on one of London's underground trains. He tries to fight the monster, stabbing it in the leg with a broken sword, but is decapitated by the gargoyle's tail. Mina manages to get on a train, where she is attacked by Bathory; just as Bathory is set to kill Mina, Dracula appears. It is revealed that by marriage Dracula and Bathory are cousins. However, even though both became vampires, Dracula still saw himself as a soldier of God, while Bathory spurned God and all those who worshiped Him. The two fight, in which Dracula is overpowered and nearly killed; only Mina's quick thinking saves him by having Bathory yanked from the train via a <b>loose</b> <b>cable.</b> The sword in her leg makes contact with the tracks, causing Bathory to burst into flame.|$|E
50|$|One {{problem with}} the system is that the heating {{elements}} can sometimes stop working, leaving {{one side of the}} screen uncleared. If this is the result of burn out, total replacement of the screen is the only remedy as the wires are actually embedded in the glass, (as opposed to a rear defogger, which can usually be repaired with conductive paint). The problem is sometimes caused by the power cable coming loose from its mounting near the base of the screen. The <b>loose</b> <b>cable</b> then catches on the windscreen wiper mechanism and fatigues over time. The remedy is then to reattach the wire to the foil {{at the base of the}} screen, but this can be problematic since the system requires such high current (~30 amps). Some owners have been known to smash the screen and submit a fraudulent insurance claim for stone damage, as Quickclear screens are expensive replacement parts and many insurance policies offer a low excess (deductible) for windscreen damage. This type of screen is also known to cause serious problems with tollway recording tags unless the tag is placed in the correct area behind the rearview mirror.|$|E
50|$|It {{is alleged}} that repairs {{conducted}} on the transformer in the earlier {{part of the day}} were unsatisfactory and resulted in loose connections that caused sparking on the B-Phase of the transformer where such repairs were carried out. This resulted in the loosening of one of the cables of the transformer which eventually came off and started dangling loose along the radiator and burnt a hole in the radiator fin. Through this hole the transformer oil started leaking out which, on account of the heat generated by the <b>loose</b> <b>cable</b> touching against the radiator, ignited the oil at about 4.55 p.m. on 13 June 1997. Since the transformer did not have an oil soak pit as required under the regulations and the standard practice, the oil that spread out of the enclosure continued leaking and spreading the fire to the adjacent parking lot where cars were parked at a distance of no more than a metre from the door of the transformer. The result was that all the cars parked in the parking area {{on the ground floor of}} the cinema hall were ablaze. Smoke started billowing in the northern and southward directions in the parking lot of the cinema complex. The northern bound smoke encountered a gate which was adjacent to a staircase leading to the cinema auditorium on the first floor. Due to chimney effect, the smoke gushed into the stairwell and eventually entered the cinema auditorium through a door and through the air conditioning ducts. The southward bound smoke similarly travelled aerially through another staircase and into the lower portion of the balcony of the auditorium from the left side. All this happened while a large number of people were seated in the auditorium enjoying the matinee show of ‘BORDER’, a popular Hindi movie with a patriotic theme.|$|E

40|$|Abstract：A new seismic {{isolation}} system,namely the prestress rubber isolator(PRI,Chinese {{patent application}} number: 200910174415 x),is introduced. The basic principle {{of this new}} isolator is: making {{all or part of}} vertical deformation of isolator be finished in advance by exerting a longitudinal pre-compressional stress on the rubber isolator with flexible cables, the prestress tension <b>cables</b> become <b>loose</b> because of unloading after the exerting of superstructure loads,and the <b>loose</b> <b>cables</b> can limit the horizontal displacement and resist the tension of isolator. The calculation formula of horizontal stiffness of isolator is derivated,and the mechanical properties are researched. The research results show that:besides the horizontal isolating property of common rubber isolators,the prestress rubber isolator has also properties of reducing vertical deformation, limiting horizontal displacement and resisting tension. Moreover,the prestress isolator has also a certain vertical isolating affect because of the improve of rubber thickness...|$|R

40|$|A death-ride is a {{long cable}} {{anchored}} between two dead ends, allowing the crossing of wide valleys. Besides these mobility purposes, it is also operated in rescue operations, or simply for leisure. From a serviceability viewpoint, a death-ride design should offer a comfortable and/or enjoyable journey to the riders, which is typically {{expressed in terms of}} maximum velocity. From a strength viewpoint, a death-ride should be designed in order to safely withstand the cable self-weight, wind forces, the rider’s load and at last but not least, the initial tension in the cable. Actually, the tensioning operation is usually subtle. Indeed, in case of a <b>loose</b> <b>cable,</b> the rider may be stopped in the in-span sagging area. Conversely a too tight cable will generate large stresses but also large outlet velocity {{at the end of the}} ride. The design of a death-ride is a tradeoff between all these aspects. The paper presents the dynamic model that was used for the design of a 1. 2 km long death-ride, with an only 10 -mm diameter, a constraint fixed in the very first stages of this project for compatibility reasons, with the existing equipment. This death-ride, built and used in May 2010 in a Grimp competition [1], has a world record of the longest death-ride in urban area. The structural part of the dynamic model is rather common, with a co-rotational description of the cable by means of a chain-like model [2]. An interesting feature, however, concerns the interaction between the rider and the cable. In fact, because the pulley is rolling on the cable, the position of the force acting on the cable, resulting from the ride, depends on the rider’s velocity, which itself depends on the cable inclination. This coupling is solved in a staggered manner, and the details of the algorithm are given in the full paper. In some limiting cases, a comparison with analytical solutions is also provided, where these analytical solutions are available [3]. Experimental validation and observation of the operated death-ride will also be presented. Peer reviewe...|$|E

50|$|Commonly used in automobiles, {{as well as}} {{construction}} machinery, cable harnesses provide {{several advantages}} over <b>loose</b> wires and <b>cables.</b> For example, many aircraft, automobiles and spacecraft contain many masses of wires which would stretch over several kilometres if fully extended. By binding the many wires and cables into a cable harness, the wires and cables can be better secured against the adverse effects of vibrations, abrasions, and moisture. By constricting the wires into a non-flexing bundle, usage of space is optimized, {{and the risk of}} a short is decreased. Since the installer has only one harness to install (as opposed to multiple wires), installation time is decreased and the process can be easily standardized. Binding the wires into a flame-retardant sleeve also lowers the risk of electrical fires.|$|R

50|$|The strain margin {{requirements}} tend to favour cable designs using multiple <b>loose</b> tubes. Tight-buffer <b>cable</b> designs {{do not provide}} sufficient strain margin and the optical fibre transmission performance is compromised under strong winds, heavy ice accretions and at high temperatures. In cables based on a single loose tube design, the optical fibres have too much freedom of movement along the cable axis. Consequently, mechanical {{energy in the form}} of wind-induced vibration of the host conductor causes the optical fibres to move gradually ‘downhill’ and allowing the excess fibre length to collect in the low point of the span. This uneven distribution of excess fibre length compromises the optical performance of the cable with increased optical attenuation at low temperatures in the relatively crowded sections of tube in the middle of spans and at high temperatures where the fibres are under strain at the high sections close to the towers. These problems are worse on longer spans.|$|R

In February and March 2012, OPERA researchers blamed this result on a <b>loose</b> fibre optic <b>cable</b> connecting a GPS receiver to an electronic card in a computer.

In May 2012, the Gran Sasso experiments BOREXINO, ICARUS, LVD and OPERA all measured neutrino velocity with a short-pulsed beam, and obtained agreement with the speed of light, showing that the original OPERA result was mistaken. Finally in July 2012, the OPERA collaboration updated their results.
