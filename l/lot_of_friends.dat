25|$|It was Neil's {{last season}} {{and it was a}} shame that his amazing career should end in an uncharacteristic {{outburst}} of bad temper against Ted Dexter. I never did {{get to the bottom of}} the row but perhaps it was just because he and Ted were total opposites as people. All I know is that his press comments on Ted lost him a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends.</b> These attacks upset the MCC players more than anything else that happened on that tour, and for Neil to retire from the game on this sour note was disappointing for those who had played with an against him, and for the public who had enjoyed his performances. For all this, you couldn't help admiring some of Neil's knocks, including his sixth Test century against England. He was nearly always exciting to watch because he was the sort of batsman who was supremely capable of winning or saving a match. He was also good to bowl to because he gave you a chance; he played shots and he took risks. And his fielding was quite brilliant; in this series, it was easily the best on either side. He stopped some wonderful shots in the covers and took some terrific catches. It was just sad to see such a talented man consumed by such bitterness.|$|E

2500|$|Gilmour later said, [...] "When {{we first}} started playing World Series Cricket, I think we lost a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> ... not player-wise, I don't think ... the players are OK. It's the {{officials}} that take a bit of swaying again... There were officials with the cricket association who I regarded as good friends and I had drinks with them whenever I was in Sydney or whenever they were in Newcastle. And they started treating me and the other players in WSC like lepers. I {{think that was the}} most hurtful thing of all. It was something that they didn't go along with and they just couldn't handle it".".|$|E
2500|$|It {{was later}} {{reported}} {{that she did not}} want to marry Lord Lascelles, that her parents forced her into an arranged marriage, and that Lascelles proposed to her after a wager at his club. Her brother, the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VIII, to whom she was very close, was against the marriage because he did not want his sister to marry someone whom she did not love. Her elder son, the Earl of Harewood, however, writes about his parents' marriage in his memoirs The Tongs and the Bones and challenges these widespread rumours that the marriage was an unhappy one. He says that [...] "they got on well together and had a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> and interests in common".|$|E
2500|$|West was {{a member}} of Instonians in 2003 and in 2004 he moved to Bangor Cricket Club where he was the team's {{professional}} player for two seasons. He moved to Belfast after marrying a girl from Northern Ireland. As early as 2005, when he finished top of the Northern Cricket Union batting averages and was named Northern Ireland Player of the Year, there was speculation that West might play for Ireland. At the end of the 2005 season, West moved back to Instonians where he was a local player rather than a professional, stating [...] "I enjoyed my two years at Bangor and made a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> there, however, now that I am working full time [...] and living in Belfast it seemed a natural move to come back to Instonians". During his second stint with Instonians, West was occasionally suffered disciplinary problems, and on his departure from the club to join Civil Service North at the end of 2007, West said [...] "I don't want to see another disciplinary committee room. I am sick of it and they are probably sick of me". On signing West, the Civil Service North captain said [...] "In Regan, we have signed a quality batsman and a quality bowler– indeed he is two players in one".|$|E

2500|$|As {{an example}} of his later {{vaudeville}} career, during the off-seasons of 1892-93, which extended into the 1893 season, he appeared in January 1893 in New York at the Imperial Music Hall on West 29th Street. He was billed as [...] "King Kelly, the Monarch of the Baseball Field." [...] His trousers and shirt collar were too big and he buttoned his jacket wrong. [...] Also, his straw hat was a size too small. [...] "It was impossible {{to look at this}} vaudeville make-up and not laugh", the New York Sun said. [...] "Kelly laughed, too, and shook a roll of music at a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> up in the private boxes." [...] Kelly came on after two French singers of opera. Stage partner William [...] "Billy" [...] Jerome [...] "took off his hat to him, and introduced him as 'Mr. Kelly, the famous $10,000 peach.'" [...] They sang a parody. [...] Later, after reciting [...] "Casey at the Bat", he said, according to the Sun, [...] "I'm right at home with Casey." [...] Also, [...] "It's the first time I’ve been in these clothes, and I don’t quite understand them.

2500|$|On {{either side}} of Number 37 are Lilla Hoparegränd ("Smaller Heaper's Alley", a {{corruption}} of [...] "Hoper's Alley", e.g. hooper indicating a profession, 'maker of barrels') and Pelikansgränd ("Pelican's Alley"), both forking off from Gaffelgränd ("Fork alley"). [...] While the building is standing on a medieval wall, the façade is from the 18th century, and the portal from the 17th century. [...] The latter was probably cut by Johan Wendelstam, a German sculptor who arrived to Stockholm in 1641 to become the Guild Master within a few years, and also cut one of the portals on Stortorget. [...] The client was apparently Dutch as the inscription on the gable stone reads: Gaet het wel men heeft veel vrinden kert het luck wie kan se vinden ("When luck stands by one have a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends,</b> but when luck turns where are they then?"). [...] Behind the front door is an entrance hall featuring a richly profiled sandstone column carrying a cross-vault. [...] The façade of Number 24 dates back to 1862, the shutters and wooden panels from that time however replaced by the rough-cast plaster probably in 1945, and the windows enlarged since. [...] The rusticated façade of Number 26 {{dates back to the}} enlargement in 1846, {{at the time it was}} however perfectly symmetric, a balance manipulated in 1973 when the enlarged opening and wooden panel of the restaurant entrance was added. [...] The northern door, still featuring some original details, gives a fair impression of what the façade looked like in the 19th century. [...] The façade of Number 28, arguably one of the oldest still existent residential properties in Stockholm, is mostly from 1874 with some details replaced in 1969.|$|E
