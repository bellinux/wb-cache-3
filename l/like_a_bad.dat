Johnston was announced as the film's director in August 1999, with Rosenberg still attached. Production was expected to begin in early 2000. Rosenberg's draft about teenagers on Isla Sorna was rejected in September 1999. Although Johnston felt that it was [...] "not a badly written script," [...] he also said, [...] "It read <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> episode of Friends".

I think Dave's getting better and Mick's still playing. It would be great to get back together just to see what musical ideas we had, and what would happen." [...] The Daily Mail subsequently interpreted his comments as a declaration that a reunion of the band's original line-up was imminent. Dave Davies swiftly rejected the idea of a reunion. He told a reporter that [...] "it would be <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> remake of Night of the Living Dead" [...] and added, [...] "Ray has been doing Karaoke Kinks shows since 1996." ...|$|E

The since-closed Cheekees disco was somewhere {{that members of the}} band would visit frequently, but a remark by Archer caused a minor riff with the owner. In a newspaper article, Archer described the disco as being [...] "like <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> wedding," [...] which offended the owner.

She confronted the man, who was {{attempting}} to steal her jewelry, and not only convinced him to return the jewelry, but [...] "wrote down a name and address, {{handed it to him}} and told him to go there that very day to get a job". When asked why she did that, Hogg responded, [...] "He didn't look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> man." [...] Later that year, she sailed to Germany, alone. While she was en route, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated, and the day before she arrived, Britain declared war on Germany. The United States was still neutral, however, so Hogg continued her tour of Europe, not leaving until several months later.|$|E

Fauxlivia also mentions liking a song by country music singer Patsy Cline when she and Peter hear it playing in a bar, suggesting either that Cline is famous in both universes, or that Fauxlivia had further studied pop culture of the prime universe before her conversation with Peter. Peter tells Fauxlivia that living with Walter is <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> buddy cop movie, referring to a genre of movies that have two men of very different and conflicting personalities forced to work together.|$|E
500|$|Just {{prior to}} the {{commencement}} of the World Heavyweight Championship Elimination Chamber match, The Undertaker {{was involved in a}} pyrotechnics accident during his ring entrance. He was temporarily engulfed in flames on three occasions when the pyrotechnics were mistimed, and his jacket briefly caught on fire. He suffered first- and second-degree burns to his neck and chest, and according to a WWE spokesperson the injury [...] "looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> sunburn". He was only allowed to participate in the match after being cleared by a ringside doctor and was given bottles of water throughout the match to douse himself with to alleviate the discomfort. Chris Jericho, who also competed in the match, has told on multiple occasions how the pyrotechnician responsible was relieved of his employment with WWE and escorted from the arena at the behest of The Undertaker.|$|E

Her death resulted in the band {{pulling out of the}} Glastonbury festival. The launch party was rescheduled for 13 July 2005 and the venue changed to Ladbroke Grove, London. Richard says that he is no longer friends with Cheekee because of an incident involving him describing his nightclub to <b>a</b> newspaper <b>like</b> [...] "a bad wedding".

500|$|The European Union and the United States as well {{as other}} western {{countries}} remain critical of the Eurasian Economic Union, with analysts stating that without modernisation and real economic reforms, the union will have little impact. The popular magazine The Economist stated that the advantages of joining the union remain unclear and further remarked [...] "The agreement was vague, with technical details left unresolved, making it a political show rather than an economic one". Outlets have also stated that without Ukraine, the Eurasian Economic Union has lost a key member state necessary {{to the success of the}} union. Bloomberg's business magazine, Businessweek has affirmed that joining Putin's Eurasian Union looks <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> deal, including for Russia.

The band recorded [...] "In Bloom" [...] with producer Butch Vig at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin during April 1990. The material recorded at Smart Studios was intended for the group's second album for the independent record label Sub Pop. The song originally had a bridge section that Vig removed. Novoselic said that after the band recorded the song, Vig cut out the bridge from the 16-track master tape with a razor blade and threw it in the garbage. The songs from these sessions were placed on a demo tape that circulated amongst the music industry, generating interest in the group among major record labels.|$|E
500|$|On November 9, 2007, Jay-Z {{appeared}} on the Charlie Rose Show to discuss the album.

So they resonated with me in a way, the story, as well as, I mean, even though everything happens, you know, the way it turns out, you know, it's one of those movies that where you champion the bad guy, because the bad guy, you know, he don't seem <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> guy, and the good guy — I mean the good guys are bad.

500|$|This claim {{has been}} criticised as a {{misinterpretation}} of how typefaces are actually measured and what printing methods are desirable. Monotype Garamond, the version bundled with Windows, has a generally smaller design {{at the same}} notional point size compared to Times New Roman and quite spindly strokes, giving it a more elegant but less readable appearance. To make letters, especially the lower-case, as high as in an equivalent setting of Times New Roman, the text size must be increased, counterbalancing any cost savings. Thomas Phinney, an expert on digital fonts, noted {{that the effect of}} simply swapping Garamond in would be compromised legibility: [...] "any of those changes, swapping to a font that sets smaller at the same nominal point size, or actually reducing the point size, or picking a thinner typeface, will reduce the legibility of the text. That seems <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> idea, as the percentage of Americans with poor eyesight is skyrocketing." [...] Professional font designer Jackson Cavanaugh commented [...] "If we're actually interested in reducing waste, just printing less – using less paper – is obviously more efficient." ...|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} negative. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely {{critical}} review and awarded it one star out of four. Vitaris wrote [...] "with its trip into blatant religiosity, 'All Souls' comes off <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> episode of Millennium". Furthermore, she {{was critical of}} the scenes wherein the Nephilims' souls were taken, noting the excessive religious imagery: [...] "as [...] soul is taken, the camera pans {{to the right and}} stops to linger on a telephone pole that forms a cross." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five. The two derided the fact that the episode's killer appears to either be God or an angel commanded by God, along {{with the fact that the}} four girls are destined to die because they are disabled and [...] "have no right to live". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson concluded that, while religious worship is not a passive act, it is treated so in the episode. Ultimately, they concluded that while [...] "looking at death from a different angle is fascinating" [...] it would be explored better [...] "in 'Closure'." ...|$|E
500|$|The reviews {{were not}} uniformly negative. Bob Graham of the San Francisco Chronicle {{wrote that the}} film [...] "effectively presented" [...] the [...] "wary, uncomprehending relationship" [...] between the humans and the Psychlos. A review at JoBlo's Movie Reviews was also positive; Berge Garabedian wrote, [...] "Despite {{starting}} off <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> Star Trek episode, this film eventually graduates {{to a higher level}} with great special effects, some really slick bad-ass aliens, an intriguing premise, and a good flow of loud, campy fun." [...] Luke Thompson of New Times LA wrote: [...] "Think Independence Day without the ponderous build-up or self-importance. Imagine how much more enjoyable the other blockbuster-of-the-moment, Gladiator, might have been if Joaquin Phoenix had addressed every one of his rivals as 'Rat brain.'" [...] Sean Axmaker of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer wrote positively of the interaction between Travolta and Whitaker in the film, comparing them to Abbott and Costello. Axmaker wrote that they provide [...] "…much-needed comic relief in an otherwise humorless paean to freedom." [...] Axmaker also wrote positively of the production design used in the film, commenting that the director had created [...] "a world of crumbling dead cities and empty malls turned into human hunting grounds…" [...] Hap Erstein of The Palm Beach Post commented: [...] "…production designer Patrick Tatopoulos contributes some good work, imagining the ruins of Denver and Washington, D.C., with echoes of Planet of the Apes." [...] In her book I Love Geeks: The Official Handbook, Carrie Tucker lists Battlefield Earth as a cult classic in the [...] "so bad, it's good" [...] genre.|$|E

[...] Including Morgan's other scripts for the show, VanDerWerff called his writing [...] "deeply, deeply funny", but said that [...] "Humbug" [...] "may be [...] weakest script". He particularly praised the ending of the episode, saying [...] "there are few other TV writers that would come up with something as haunting and as perfectly understanding of the human condition as the final reveal of who the killer is." [...] Also writing for The A.V. Club in 2010, Zack Handlen called it [...] "a terrific episode ... well-written and odd". Ted Cox of the Daily Herald called [...] "Humbug" [...] "the pivotal episode of The X-Files." [...] Robert Goodwin said of the episode [...] "Talk about offbeat. It's very theatrical and grandiose. The trick was being careful that it didn't become <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> Vincent Price movie, but it worked out well." [...] Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity gave the episode an A grade. Reviewers for website IGN named [...] "Humbug" [...] the tenth best standalone X-Files episode of the entire series. Topless Robot named it the sixth funniest episode of the series.|$|E
500|$|This episode {{received}} positive reviews. Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic {{said she}} found the episode both [...] "dishearting" [...] and [...] "engaging", as well as later adding that it was [...] "sad" [...] and [...] "frightening" [...] when Jake O'Connor was accused of murdering his father. Writing about the final scene which shows Megan enter the Russell’s house, {{she said that she}} wanted to [...] "smack" [...] Megan for doing so, saying [...] "What was she thinking? She knew Scanlon had committed the murder and that Jen was acting strangely when she wouldn't let her in. Yet, she went back to find the door open and walked right in. Megan's intelligent enough to know that something wasn't right but she's unarmed and untrained to handle the situation. For some reason she seemed incapable of making the smart decision to wait for the real police". Orlando said of the flashback scenes that she hopes in future episodes they [...] "delve deeper" [...] into Megan's father's death, saying that it was [...] "certainly a turning point for the character and I'd love to know more". She said it was [...] "nice" [...] to see scenes between Peter and Megan and said of the carpooling storyline, [...] "Snacks for carpool didn't seem <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> idea but they could have used a couple of healthier options to go with the chocolate". Of Curtis and Kate's examining Manny Santos, she said that their expressions were [...] "hysterical" [...] and [...] "funny" [...] when they decided whether Manny was a juvenile, adding that it gave [...] "a much needed moment of comic relief in an otherwise heavy episode". She finished in saying that the episode [...] "grabbed her attention", finishing, [...] "These engaging characters and this episode was a winner for Body of Proof". In the carpooling storyline it featured Tastykake's products, a line of snack foods based in Philadelphia. Such products which were mentioned were Krimpets and KandyKakes, with the ABC saying they were the [...] "best".|$|E

I've learned a lot from them", and he explained that he was working on that day with Mandler, someone he respects and looks up to. On the video, Drake said, [...] "We talked colors, we talked epic, emotion-evoking visuals." [...] He called the story of the video interesting and the song tells [...] "sort of a love story". He explained that the video {{has a lot to do}} with his debut album, stating [...] "The album is about finding love, feeling 'Have I sold my soul' as far as 'Will I ever be able to gain the trust of a woman? Will I only be able to be around the dark, evil women? Will I ever find that pure love?' Those elements are in the video." [...] In a separate interview on his Away From Home Tour, with MTV News, Drake said the video takes the song to [...] "another place". He said it offers up a different look to the song. He explained, [...] "This video is what I was really thinking about. The song is <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> dream — but it's not a bad dream, it's not a terrible dream. It's a little evil. The video really reflects that. It's a struggle between the purities of my past life and what this new life has to offer. Even in the video, you see me looking back and forth between the two and deciding. At the end of the video I don't necessarily make a decision, but when you get the album, you'll see what choice I make." ...|$|E
