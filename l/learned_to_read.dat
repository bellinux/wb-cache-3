5|$|At {{the age of}} six, Flanagan's parents {{gave him}} a {{clarinet}} for Christmas. He <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> music from playing the clarinet, but {{within a few years}} he preferred the piano. The family had a piano in the house, and Flanagan received lessons from one of his brothers, Johnson, and Gladys Wade Dillard, who also taught Kirk Lightsey and Barry Harris. Flanagan graduated from Northern High School, which he attended with other future musicians, including Sonny Red.|$|E
5|$|Beginning January 17, 1848, {{the eight}} {{founders of the}} Misericorde Sisters, {{including}} Cadron-Jetté, commenced practical training in midwifery under Dr Eugène-Hercule Trudele, a young obstetrician. The objective of the training was to better prepare the sisters to meet the obligations of their fourth vow. The training lasted for 18 months and concluded with an examination before {{two members of the}} College of Physicians and Surgeons of Lower Canada, with the result that on July 12, 1849, the women received formal certificates of midwifery. It is most likely during this period or the years immediately following that Cadron-Jetté <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and write.|$|E

Her prized possession was a bound volume of the Dissenters' Theological Magazine and Review, in which the family's pastor, the Reverend James Wheaton, had published two essays, one insisting that God had created the world in six days, the other urging dissenters to study the new science of geology.|$|E

This section discusses how oral and written language interrelate by comparing a child's progrss in <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> talk with progress in <b>learning</b> how <b>to</b> write. The section gives examples of how children <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and write from experiencing print-rich environments and {{being part of a}} literate society.

5|$|Schuur {{first learned}} {{to play the piano}} by ear. Though she later <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> braille-written music, she found its use {{frustrating}} and impractical since it took away use of one of her hands while playing the piano; however, she frequently used braille-transcribed lyrics in performances and during recording sessions. One of her first public performances was at age ten, singing country music at Tacoma's Holiday Inn; a booking arranged by her aunt. Even when she was a student at the Washington School for the Blind, she would come home on weekends, perform on Friday and Saturday nights and take a train back to school for Monday classes.|$|E
5|$|Jo Elizabeth Stafford {{was born}} in Coalinga, California, in 1917, to Grover Cleveland Stafford and Anna Stafford (née York)a second cousin of World War I hero Sergeant Alvin York. She was the third of four children. Both her parents enjoyed singing and sharing music with their family. Stafford's father hoped {{for success in the}} California oil fields when he moved his family from Gainesboro, Tennessee, but worked in a {{succession}} of unrelated jobs. Her mother was an accomplished banjo player, playing and singing many of the folk songs which influenced Stafford's later career. Anna insisted that her children should take piano lessons, but Jo was the only one among her sisters who took a keen interest in it, and through this she <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> music.|$|E
5|$|Kaʻauwai revered Hoapili as {{a father}} figure and {{accompanied}} him into battle and fought in the 1824 rebellion of Humehume, {{on the island of}} Kauai. He was present when the American missionaries, who arrived in Hawaii in 1820, established a mission station at Lahaina. After the converted Hoapili imposed a law requiring his household retainers to learn the Hawaiian alphabet or otherwise be deprived of food, the obedient Kaʻauwai abstained from food for two entire days and he <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and write. He and his friend David Malo became interested in Christianity {{at the same time and}} both served as early helpers to the missionaries in Lahaina, although unlike Malo, he was never licensed to preach.

5|$|The {{education}} of Pedro II began {{while he was}} still heir to throne, and he <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and write in Portuguese at age five. His first tutors were Mariana de Verna and Friar Antonio de Arrábida. When he became Emperor he already had several professors. Amongst these were Félix Taunay (father of Alfredo d'Escragnolle Taunay) and Luís Alves de Lima e Silva (son of the regent Francisco de Lima e Silva), who taught French and Fencing respectively, and towards both of whom he developed lifelong friendship and admiration. Pedro II passed the entire day studying with only two hours reserved for amusements. He would wake up at 6.30a.m. and begin studies at seven, continuing until 10p.m., after which he would go to bed. The disciplines were diverse, including everything from languages, history, philosophy, astronomy, physics, geography and music, to hunting, equestrianism and fencing.|$|E
5|$|The {{family moved}} again in 1809, {{settling}} on Bayou Teche in Louisiana before finding {{a permanent home}} in Opelousas in 1812. The Bowie children were raised on the frontier and even as small children were expected to help clear the land and plant crops. All the children <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and write in English, but James and his elder brother Rezin could also read, write, and speak Spanish and French fluently. The children learned to survive on the frontier and how to fish and run a farm and plantation. James Bowie became proficient with pistol, rifle, and knife, and {{had a reputation for}} fearlessness. When he was a boy, one of his Indian friends even taught him to rope alligators.|$|E
5|$|He never {{attended}} {{school and was}} illiterate for some years of his early life. He <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and write reportedly out of curiosity after reading and hearing comic books and stories of Kalimán and Porfirio Cadena, El Ojo del Vidrio on the local radio station. In his autobiography, Moreno González said that as a child he believed he had the superhuman ability of speaking telepathically with animals like Kalimán did in the comics. He {{said he wanted to}} be a hero like the comic characters. As a child, he was accustomed to seeing gunmen near his home, and played las guerritas ("war games") for fun. While playing the game, he often pretended to be dead, only to say later on that he had been wounded in the game but that he had managed to survive. At the age of twelve, he moved to Apatzingán and made a living by selling matches, peeling onions, working at a melon field, and throwing out the trash from several booths at a marketplace. As a teenager in the late 1980s, Moreno González migrated illegally to the United States, settling in California, where he eventually began selling marijuana. After some years, he moved to Texas and in 1994 was arrested for drug trafficking charges in McAllen. Nearly a decade later in 2003, the U.S. government charged him with conspiracy to distribute five tons of narcotics and issued an arrest warrant. Moreno González then fled back to Mexico.|$|E
40|$|<b>Learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> is {{considered}} <b>to</b> be a crucial step in any child’s education, and literacy {{is a central}} concern, not just for educators and parents but for politicians and wider society as well. Rethinking <b>Learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>Read</b> offers a unique contribution to the subject by investigating in depth, for the first time, how home educated children <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> Based on an international sample of 311 families {{with a total of}} 400 children this book explores, the experiences of those who <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> away from the mainstream school agenda. The results constitute a unique resource and insight into how children <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> when not constrained by school methods. A wide range of views and pedagogical attitudes are presented and considered from philosophical, psychological and practical points of view. The result is a provocative discussion of literacy built around the words of home educating parents as they describe their children’s experiences and deliberate themselves on how we understand <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> In so doing many normative assumptions are challenged including the necessity for age related achievement targets, the pursuit of a universal “best method” approach <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> instruction, a “building block” progressive approach, and the contention that children need to be professionally and actively taught <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> Through the analysis of parents’ experiences and reflections the authors begin work on the construction of alternative representations of what happens when a child <b>learns</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> This book also has wider implications in understanding how learning takes place in the home, the relationship between teaching and learning and gives real insight to the phenomena that is home education...|$|R
40|$|I {{am pleased}} to be here today to speak about children’s reading in the {{information}} age and to have this opportunity to think together about the vital role of teachers teaming with school librarians to prepare children to meet the challenges they face in this new environment. <b>Learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> is a transformational experience in a young child’s life. Of course, children who have been <b>read</b> <b>to</b> from the time they were infants are at a great advantage in <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> Reading is not a natural ability that develops with age, like talking and walking. For most children <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> involves a struggle to put letters, sounds and meaning together so that they gradually develop the ability <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> Once it is acquired, reading seems so natural that we can easily forget the struggles of <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> <b>Learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> is a crucial step in a child’s education. It provides the requisite skills for <b>reading</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn.</b> Reading opens up the fascinating world of ideas.

25|$|Early Braille {{education}} {{is crucial to}} literacy for a blind or low-vision child. A study conducted {{in the state of}} Washington found that people who learned braille at an early age did just as well, if not better than their sighted peers in several areas, including vocabulary and comprehension. In the preliminary adult study, while evaluating the correlation between adult literacy skills and employment, it was found that 44% of the participants who had <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> in Braille were unemployed, compared to the 77% unemployment rate of those who had <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> using print. Currently, among the estimated 85,000 blind adults in the United States, 90% of those who are braille-literate are employed. Among adults who do not know braille, only 33% are employed. Statistically, history has proven that braille reading proficiency provides an essential skill set that allows blind or low-vision children to compete with their sighted peers in a school environment and later in life as they enter the workforce.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This {{monograph}} discusses research, theory, {{and practice}} relevant <b>to</b> how children <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> English. After an initial overview of writing systems, the discussion summarizes research from developmental psychology on children’s language competency {{when they enter}} school and {{on the nature of}} early reading development. Subsequent sections review theories of <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>read,</b> the characteristics of children who do not <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> (i. e., who have developmental dyslexia), research from cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience on skilled reading, and connectionist models of <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> The implications of the research findings for <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and teaching reading are discussed. Next, the primary methods used <b>to</b> teach <b>reading</b> (phonics and whole language) are summarized. The final section reviews laboratory and classroom studies on teaching reading. From these different sources of evidence, two inescapable conclusions emerge: (a) Mastering the alphabetic principle (that written symbols are associated with phonemes) is essential to becoming proficient in the skill of reading, and (b) methods that teach this principle directly are more effective than those that do not (especially for children who are at risk in some way for having difficulty <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>read).</b> Using whole-language activities to supplement phonics instruction does help make reading fun and meaningful for children, but ultimately, phonics instruction is critically important because it helps beginning readers understand the alphabetic principle and learn new words. Thus, elementary-school teachers who make the alphabetic principle explicit are most effective in helping their students become skilled, independent readers...|$|R
