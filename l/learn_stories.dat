Kitano {{said that after}} playing comedy clubs he would be invited to drink with yakuza, where he would <b>learn</b> <b>stories</b> about the big crime bosses. His first major film role in Nagisa Oshima's Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence (where he starred opposite Tom Conti, Ryuichi Sakamoto and David Bowie), featured him cast as a tough POW camp sergeant during World War II. Kitano {{said that he was}} happy with his performance and snuck into a showing of the film to see how the audience would accept him as a serious actor instead of a comedian. He was devastated when the audience burst into laughter upon his appearing on screen, but vowed to stick to serious and dark characters in film.|$|E
5000|$|After {{emancipation}} in 1863, {{the former}} slaves are being included in society. Baraka explains, these former slaves {{are no longer}} Africans. They are people of African descent who have, for generations, adapted to American culture. Their arrival and assimilation are most importantly not by choice. After being forcefully brought to America, the following generations are raised {{in a system that}} obliterates any trace of African culture. Children are immediately separated from their slave mothers at birth. They only <b>learn</b> <b>stories</b> and songs about Africa but lack the experience. Baraka states, [...] "the only way of life these children knew was the accursed thing they had been born into" [...] (p. 13). He shows that slavery is the most influential factor in African-American culture. He goes on to include the living conditions of slavery as an additional force. He refers to Herskovits's ideas to explain the dilution of African culture in the United States specifically. In the Caribbean {{and the rest of the}} Americas there are much heavier traces of African culture in the slave population. Herskovits explains this as a result of the master to slave ratio in these areas. In the United States the master to slave ratio was much smaller than in other regions of the New World, and is reflected in its form of a slave culture with constant association between the master and slave.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a number}} of concerns {{about the value of}} <b>Learning</b> <b>Stories</b> for assessing children’s learning in early childhood centres. The technique requires teachers to observe children and write narrative “stories ” to show the learning that is occurring in particular situations. There is a focus on assessing children’s dispositions for learning rather than describing their knowledge and skill levels. Although there is some case-study documentation to support the value of <b>Learning</b> <b>Stories,</b> there is little evidence about the effectiveness of the widespread use of <b>Learning</b> <b>Stories</b> to assess and enhance children’s learning. Concerns about <b>Learning</b> <b>Stories</b> include: difficulties with establishing the validity or accountability of Learning Stories; problems with making subjective interpretations based on short observations; a lack of guidance on where, when and how often to make Learning Stories; problems with defining and assessing learning dispositions; and difficulties in using <b>Learning</b> <b>Stories</b> to show changes in children’s learning over time...|$|R
40|$|Although <b>Learning</b> <b>Stories</b> {{are widely}} used in New Zealand early {{childhood}} settings, there are doubts {{about the effectiveness of}} this assessment technique. A different approach to assessing young children, known as Learning Notes, is introduced in this article. Unlike <b>Learning</b> <b>Stories,</b> <b>Learning</b> Notes do not follow a story format or focus on dispositions to learn. Learning Notes can be used to provide an accurate description of an event, an interpretation of the learning that occurred, and ideas for future learning. When evaluated against key principles of observational assessment, it is argued that Learning Notes provide a more comprehensive and practical approach than is possible with <b>Learning</b> <b>Stories...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} use of <b>learning</b> <b>stories</b> {{as a way to}} gather, analyse and use evidence to support the development of social studies conceptual understandings. This is important because there is limited research in New Zealand related to social studies assessment in secondary school environments, or in the monitoring of conceptual changes in understanding. The limited research that can be drawn upon highlights the challenges social studies teachers face teaching and assessing conceptually. Sociocultural theory featured strongly throughout the research, through the decision to investigate <b>learning</b> <b>stories</b> as an assessment approach, as well as the lens with which to approach the methodology. In order to investigate the <b>Learning</b> <b>Story</b> Framework, as an intervention, a qualitative design-based methodology was utilised involving one in-depth case study. The research composed of three iterative phases, gathering evidence using semi-structured interviews, participant observation and documentation analysis, including reflective journals.

40|$|Contemporary {{perspectives}} {{in early childhood}} education within Australia are founded in socio-constructivist perspectives and increasingly focus on making children’s learning visible to themselves and to others. This paper reports results from a three year study undertaken within two community based pre-schools in NSW, Australia. The study explored the use of narrative descriptions of play and learning supported by work samples and visual images or <b>Learning</b> <b>Stories</b> {{as a tool for}} documenting, analyzing and planning for children’s play and learning. In both settings <b>Learning</b> <b>Stories</b> replaced more traditional forms of documentation which focused on children’s individual development. The results of the study indicated that <b>Learning</b> <b>Stories</b> opened the dialogue between children, families and educators. The use of images and work samples to support the narratives facilitated greater communication between children, families and educators resulted in greater sharing of their different perspectives and subjectivities. <b>Learning</b> <b>Stories</b> also enabled the documentation of children’s own unique questions, interests and knowledge and raised awareness of the creativity and complexity of young children’s thinking. Educators and families were able to work together to strengthen the creative learning opportunities provided for children in both the home and the educational settings. This subsequently increased the level of children’s engagement in, and reflection on, their own learning...|$|R
40|$|Early {{childhood}} education {{has become a}} focus of government policy across the world. Part of the present increased interest in early {{childhood education}} has been a focus on curriculum frameworks and socio/cultural methods of assessment. Currently, New Zealand {{has emerged as a}} world leader in early childhood education, and observation and assessment techniques, developed in New Zealand, have become an international focus of research and pedagogic practice. One exemplar practice to have emerged from research in New Zealand is the assessment of children&# 039;s learning. An assessment project, conducted at the instigation of the New Zealand Ministry of Education, was designed to recognise key outcomes from the New Zealand curriculum, Te Whariki, and to provide practitioners with a tool that would assist in the development of assessment ideas and procedures. The result was <b>Learning</b> <b>Stories.</b> This present research explored the introduction of <b>Learning</b> <b>Stories</b> into Australia and investigated the potential of <b>Learning</b> <b>Stories</b> as an assessment tool for early childhood practitioners in the context of Saudi Arabia...|$|R

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the early {{childhood}} years and describes research that has examined children&rsquo;s music experiences in formal care and education settings in Melbourne, Australia. This research uses a contextual view of children and their learning {{and is based on}} an assumption that learning is social, involves engagement with others and is appropriated by children as protagonists in their own learning and development. The children&rsquo;s experiences have been recorded using <b>Learning</b> <b>Stories.</b> These have become an increasingly popular method of recording and analyzing children&rsquo;s activities for both practitioners and researchers. <b>Learning</b> <b>Stories</b> are a sociocultural analytic tool that emphasize children&rsquo;s dispositions for engaging in relationships with the social and physical context. The concept is derived from Bruner&rsquo;s notion of story to record and interpret children&rsquo;s emerging narratives about their learning.

40|$|To {{benefit and}} protect the populace, {{government}} policies often promise aspirational changes to current practice. Different kinds of narratives are important in the framing, explanation, motivation, and understanding of policies and strategies. For example, the UK government's 2008 Climate Change Act proclaimed that all new homes will be zero carbon by 2016. This âhero storyâ, where society is âsavedâ by clever technologies, is inspiring, positive and familiar. An alternative is the âlearning storyâ, where things are not quite as simple as they first seemed. In a <b>learning</b> <b>story,</b> protagonists are normal {{people who need to}} overcome a challenge. In energy policy, the <b>learning</b> <b>story</b> could address the gap between the technical potential and what is achieved in practice. Three real-world examples from retrofit and new-build projects are used to show how implicit narratives can create conflict when the tellers (e. g. researchers) have to tell one kind of story but have data for the other. Recommendations are provided for a balanced approach to the deployment of different kinds of tales by policy-makers, researchers, implementers and users. Harnessing the <b>learning</b> <b>story</b> and developing a âcaring storyâ could motivate policy-makers and the public to invest effort in building performance...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{engages with}} {{assessment}} practices in Aotearoa New Zealand. Te Whāriki, the internationally recognized early childhood curriculum framework, {{lies at the}} root of contemporary narrative assessment practices, and the concept of <b>learning</b> <b>stories.</b> We outline historical and societal underpinnings of these practices, and elevate the essence of assessment through <b>learning</b> <b>stories</b> and their particu- lar ontological and epistemological aims and purposes. The paper emphasizes early childhood teaching and learning as a complex relational, inter-subjective, material, moral and political practice. It adopts a critical lens and begins from the premise that early childhood teachers are {{in the best position to}} make decisions about teach- ing and learning in their localized, contextualized settings, with and for the children with whom they share it. We examine the notion of effectiveness and ‘what works’ in assessment, with an emphasis on the importance of allowing for uncertainty, and for the invisible elements in children’s learning. Te Whāriki and <b>learning</b> <b>stories</b> are positioned as strong underpinnings of culturally and morally open, rich and complex assessment, to be constantly renegotiated within each local context, in Aotearoa New Zealand and beyond...|$|R
