The belt is discovered under his clothes and a trial by ordeal is proposed. The seneschal's innocence is proven in an ordeal by water: he has never had sex with the maiden. When <b>Liénor</b> reveals that she is in fact Guillaume's sister, the seneschal's earlier claim of having deflowered her is proven a lie. The seneschal is shackled and incarcerated, and the wedding is celebrated with great pomp.

50|$|A lien, {{also known}} as a right of retention, may be a real {{security}} right which arises by operation of law, or it may be a personal right. Its purpose is to secure the repayment of money or labour that the lienholder has expended on the <b>lienor’s</b> movable or immovable property. It operates as a defence to the <b>lienor’s</b> rei vindicatio and entitles the lienholder to retain possession of the property until compensated for the expenditure incurred. It does not include the right to have the property sold in execution. In Singh v Santam, the court held that the lienholder must have been in physical possession of the property at the time he incurred the expense. (A lien differs from a tacit hypothec most obviously in this respect.) As soon as the lienholder’s claim has been paid, the lien terminates automatically; it is accessory to the principal debt.|$|R

5000|$|Attachment of a {{security}} interest does not ensure that the secured party's interest in the collateral will be superior to the interest of other <b>lienors</b> or subsequent buyers, lessees, or licensee. In general, to obtain priority over such other claimants, the security interest must be [...] "perfected." [...] Although some security interests are perfected automatically upon attachment, see U.C.C. § 9-309, for most perfection must be achieved through compliance with statutory procedure designed to give the world notice that the collateral is encumbered. The most common method of perfection is through filing a financing statement (often referred to by its form number: UCC-1) in the appropriate state office (usually {{the office of the}} Secretary of State) in the U.S. state in which the debtor is located. See U.C.C. §§ 9-301, 9-310. For real property, the creditor records {{a security}} instrument such as a mortgage or deed of trust in the county where the real property is located.|$|R
40|$|Under {{both the}} prior and current laws, a {{creditor}} seeking {{to satisfy a}} judgment out of property of the judgment debtor obtains a writ of execution from the {{clerk of the court}} that issued the judgment and then delivers the writ to a sheriff in one of Florida 2 ̆ 7 s sixty-seven counties. The writ commands the sheriff to levy on property of the debtor until the amount stated in the writ is satisfied. Under the prior law, delivery of the writ to the sheriff not only initiated the execution process, but under the seminal case of Love v. Williams, it also created an inchoate lien on all personal property subject to execution in that county. The sheriff was required to keep a record of the delivery of such writs in an execution docket. If the judgment debt was not satisfied out of the proceeds of the initial levy, or if there were no levy, the sheriff would keep the writ and the inchoate lien would continue, attaching to any new personal property the debtor might bring into the county. The effect of the inchoate lien was that if anyone were to cause the sheriff to levy on personalty of the debtor, the inchoate lien would ripen into a true lien which would date from the original moment of delivery to the sheriff. Having levied, the sheriff would sell under the writ first delivered. The proceeds of the execution sale were then distributed in the order in which the existing writs had been delivered to the sheriff. As I have discussed elsewhere, there were two significant problems with this process. The foremost criticism was that the inchoate lien operated as a secret lien. Most people buying or lending against property did not know of or bother to check the sheriff 2 ̆ 7 s docket to see if the property might be subject to an inchoate execution lien. If so, and if the sheriff were later to levy on the property, they would lose it. This result flies squarely {{in the face of the}} fundamental policy in debtor-creditor law of protecting good faith transferees from unfair surprise. The second major criticism of the process was that it had the occasional effect of insulating debtors from the collection efforts of diligent creditors. Imagine a would-be diligent judgment creditor who found nonexempt property of the debtor and took steps to levy on it, only to check the docket and discover a number of prior inchoate <b>lienors</b> passively waiting for someone else to come along and levy on the property of the debtor. If the buildup of prior writs was substantial enough, the judgment creditor 2 ̆ 7 s only reasonable response would be to give up. The debtor then would continue to enjoy assets that could have been applied to payment of the debt, insulated from the efforts of the diligent judgment creditor by the buildup of prior inchoate liens. The new lien law has a number of salutary features, but the primary motivation to enact it was the desire to eliminate these problems. My purpose here is to describe and provide examples as to how the new law is intended to work, how it intersects with other law, how portions of the law came into being, what problems concerned us, and how we sought to remedy those concerns. I also point out areas in which the statute is flawed or inadequate and suggest how, consistent with the goals of the statute, those problems might be approached...|$|R

40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} construction of the heroine, through intratextual borrowings and references, in Gerbert de Montreuil 2 ̆ 7 s Roman de la Violette. Gerbert skillfully employs a number of sources, particularly Jean Renart, Chretien de Troyes, the Breton lays, and the Chanson de Florence de Rome, in constructing his romance and his heroine. Because the Violette uses earlier works so extensively, and was written in the pivotal early 13 th century, it provides a uniquely appropriate text in which to study the changing representation of the heroine. Through his intertextual borrowings and references Gerbert systematically exploits major archetypal female literary figures [...] such as the Fee, the lyric Dame, or the Sainte [...] in order to progressively expose facets of his heroine 2 ̆ 7 s character. The foregrounding of intertextuality also calls into question the relation of the heroine [...] and the poet/narrator [...] to discourse. ^ Each Chapter of the dissertation (except Chapter One which introduces the text and the theoretical issues involved) explores the relation of the heroine, Euriaut, to a major intertext and its genre. Thus Chapter Two concerns Euriaut 2 ̆ 7 s relationship to <b>Lienor,</b> the heroine in Jean Renart, 2 ̆ 7 s Roman de la Rose. Gerbert 2 ̆ 7 s reutilization of lyric intercalations and the flower-shaped birthmark establishes a dialogue between these two closely related romance which questions the discursive prowess fundamental to the Rose. Chapter Three explores the contribution of the figures of the Fee and Chretien 2 ̆ 7 s Enide. The theme of the forest meeting between Fee and knight found in the Breton Lays introduces questions of female sexuality and discourse. Finally, Chapter Four deals with Gerbert 2 ̆ 7 s use of the epic Florence de Rome and the figure of the sainte. The discourse of lies, (false) appearances, and prayer all play a role in Gerbert 2 ̆ 7 s rewriting of this key episode in the development of his heroine. Euriaut is fee and sainte, romance heroine and lyric amie and she is none of these just as Gerbert 2 ̆ 7 s romance comes out of these other texts and genres and yet cannot be reduced to just a series of intertexts. ...|$|E
