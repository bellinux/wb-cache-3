40|$|We {{propose a}} {{definition}} of a <b>linking</b> <b>system</b> associated to a saturated fusion system which is more general than the one currently in the literature and thus allows a more flexible choice of objects of <b>linking</b> <b>systems.</b> More precisely, we define subcentric subgroups of fusion systems {{in a way that}} every quasicentric subgroup of a saturated fusion system is subcentric. Whereas the objects of <b>linking</b> <b>systems</b> in the current definition are always quasicentric, the objects of our <b>linking</b> <b>systems</b> only need to be subcentric. We prove that, associated to each saturated fusion system F, there is a unique <b>linking</b> <b>system</b> whose objects are the subcentric subgroups of F. Furthermore, the nerve of such a subcentric <b>linking</b> <b>system</b> is homotopy equivalent to the nerve of the centric <b>linking</b> <b>system</b> associated to F. We believe that the existence of subcentric <b>linking</b> <b>systems</b> opens a new way for a classification of fusion systems of characteristic p-type. The various results we prove about subcentric subgroups give furthermore some evidence that the concept is of interest for studying extensions of <b>linking</b> <b>systems</b> and fusion systems.

40|$|A <b>linking</b> <b>system</b> of {{difference}} sets {{is a collection}} of mutually related group difference sets, whose advantageous properties have been used to extend classical constructions of <b>systems</b> of <b>linked</b> symmetric designs. The central problems are to determine which groups contain a <b>linking</b> <b>system</b> {{of difference}} sets, and how large such a system can be. All previous results are constructive, and are restricted to 2 -groups. We make a connection to Kerdock sets which leads to large <b>linking</b> <b>systems</b> of difference sets in elementary abelian $ 2 $-groups. We use an elementary projection argument to show that neither the McFarland/Dillon nor the Spence construction of difference sets can give rise to a <b>linking</b> <b>system</b> of difference sets in non-$ 2 $-groups. We give a new construction for <b>linking</b> <b>systems</b> of difference sets in 2 -groups, taking advantage of a previously unrecognized connection with group difference matrices. This construction simplifies and extends prior results, producing larger <b>linking</b> <b>systems</b> than before in certain 2 -groups, new <b>linking</b> <b>systems</b> in other 2 -groups for which no system was previously known, and the first known examples in nonabelian groups.

40|$|Abstract. A p-local finite {{group is}} an {{algebraic}} structure which includes two categories, a fusion <b>system</b> and a <b>linking</b> <b>system,</b> which mimic the fusion and linking categories of a finite group {{over one of}} its Sylow subgroups. The p-completion of the geometric realization of the <b>linking</b> <b>system</b> is the classifying space of the finite group. In this paper, we study the geometric realization, without completion, of <b>linking</b> <b>systems</b> of certain exotic 2 -local finite groups whose existence was predicted by Solomon and Benson, and prove {{that they are all}} simply connected. A p-local finite group consists of a finite p-group S together with a pair of categories F and L — the fusion system and the centric <b>linking</b> <b>system</b> — with auxiliary structures which relate F and L. The idea is to mimic the structure of a finite group G having S as a Sylow p-subgroup, by first providing, by means of the fusion system F, a collection of maps between subgroups of S which are consistent with the notion of conjugation by elements of G, and then, with the <b>linking</b> <b>system</b> L, providing a collection of candidates for the G-normalizers of a large class of subgroups of S. The resulting object (S, F, L) should be indistinguishible from such a finite group G, at least from an algebrai...|$|R
