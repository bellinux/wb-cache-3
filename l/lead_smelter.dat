5|$|Michael Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen), {{also known}} as Bishop II, is a {{scientist}} employed by Weyland-Yutani. Ripley meets him at the furnace, where he tells her that he designed the Bishop android series; his medical team will extract the Alien Queen inside her and destroy it. Ripley does not believe him, and backs away towards the furnace as he begs her {{to give him the}} creature. Aaron sneaks up behind him and strikes him with a crowbar, nearly ripping off his ear. He watches in despair as Ripley sacrifices herself by falling into the <b>lead</b> <b>smelter.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{blast furnace}} {{used at the}} Nyrstar Port Pirie <b>lead</b> <b>smelter</b> differs from most other lead blast {{furnaces}} in {{that it has a}} double row of tuyeres rather than the single row normally used. The lower shaft of the furnace has a chair shape with {{the lower part of the}} shaft being narrower than the upper. The lower row of tuyeres being located in the narrow part of the shaft. This allows the upper part of the shaft to be wider than the standard.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the radioactive risks, the airborne lead and particulate soot levels in Ozyorsk (along {{with much of the}} Ural industrial region) are also very high—roughly equal to the levels encountered along busy roadsides in the era predating unleaded gasoline and catalytic converters—due to the presence of numerous <b>lead</b> <b>smelters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lead-acid battery {{recycling}} {{is one of}} the most successful recycling programs in the world. In the United States 99% of all battery lead was recycled between 2009 and 2013. An effective pollution control system is a necessity to prevent lead emission. Continuous improvement in battery recycling plants and furnace designs is required to keep pace with emission standards for <b>lead</b> <b>smelters.</b>|$|R
25|$|Higher {{concentrations}} of lead {{have been found}} in the organs of bottlenose dolphins stranded near the <b>lead</b> <b>smelter,</b> compared to dolphins stranded elsewhere in South Australia. The health impacts of these metals on dolphins has been examined and some associations between high metal concentrations and kidney toxicity were noted.|$|E
25|$|In West Dallas, Texas, {{a mostly}} African American and Latino community, a <b>lead</b> <b>smelter</b> {{poisoned}} the surrounding neighborhood, elementary school, and day cares {{for more than}} five decades. Dallas city officials were informed in 1972 that children in the proximity of the smelter were being exposed to lead contamination. The city sued the lead smelters in 1974, then reduced its lead regulations in 1976. It wasn't until 1981 that the EPA commissioned a study on the lead contamination in this neighborhood, and found the same results that had been found a decade earlier. In 1983, the surrounding day cares had to close due to the lead exposure while the <b>lead</b> <b>smelter</b> remained operating. It was later revealed that EPA Deputy Administrator John Hernandez had deliberately stalled the clean up of the lead-contaminated hot spots. It wasn't until 1993 that the site was declared a Superfund site, and {{at the time it was}} one of the largest ones. However, it was not until 2004 when the EPA completed the clean-up efforts and eliminated the lead pollutant sources from the site.|$|E
25|$|Billiton's initial {{business}} forays included tin {{and lead}} smelting in the Netherlands, {{followed in the}} 1940s by bauxite mining in Indonesia and Suriname. In 1970, Shell acquired Billiton accelerated this growth. The tin and <b>lead</b> <b>smelter</b> in Arnhem, the Netherlands, was shut down in the 1990s. Billiton owned a tin smelting and refining plant in Phuket, Thailand called Thaisarco (short for Thailand Smelting And Refining Company, Limited), which still exists today.|$|E
40|$|Childhood lead {{exposure}} and poisoning near primary <b>lead</b> <b>smelters</b> continues in {{developed and developing}} countries. In the United States, the problem of lead poi-soning in children caused by smelter emissions was first documented in the early 1970 s. In 1978, Environmental Protection Agency set National Ambient Air Quality Standards for lead. Attainment of this lead standard in areas near operating <b>lead</b> <b>smelters</b> took twenty to thirty years. Childhood {{lead exposure}} and poisoning con-tinued to occur after the lead National Ambient Air Quality Standards were set and before compliance was achieved. This article analyzes and discusses the factors {{that led to the}} eventual achievement of the 1978 lead National Ambient Air Quality Standards near primary smelters and the reduction of children’s blood lead levels in surrounding communities. Factors such as federal and state regulation, monitoring of emissions, public health activities such as blood lead surveillance and health edu-cation, relocation of children, environmental group and community advocacy, and litigation all played a role...|$|R

25|$|The {{problems}} in the concentrator also affected the performance of MIM's Mount Isa <b>lead</b> <b>smelter.</b> The lead–zinc ore also contained increasing amounts of fine-grained, carbonaceous pyrite (FeS2). This material was naturally hydrophobic and floated {{without the aid of}} a collector into the lead concentrate, diluting it. The additional sulfur from the pyrite in the lead concentrate reduced the lead smelter's lead production because the ability to eliminate sulfur from the concentrate was lead smelter's capacity bottleneck.|$|E
25|$|By 1904, {{there were}} three large copper {{smelters}} and one <b>lead</b> <b>smelter</b> in the Salt Lake valley. The sulfur dioxide gas emissions from the smokestacks caused significant crop damage to neighboring crops. During the 1904-1905 winter, the farmers gathered together and decided to file suit against the smelters in the United States District Court of Utah. In 1906, Federal Court Judge Marshall ruled that the smelters could not smelt ores containing more than 10% sulfur, effectively closing all of the aforementioned smelters.|$|E
25|$|Port Pirie's main {{employer}} is Nyrstar, which operates the largest lead smelter/refinery {{in the southern}} hemisphere. A <b>lead</b> <b>smelter</b> has been operating in Port Pirie since the 1880s, and high blood lead levels in the local population are an ongoing concern. The Stack, which can be seen kilometres away, is 205 metres tall, and is the tallest structure in the state. In 2006 Zinifex formed {{a joint venture with}} Umicore to create Nyrstar, which owns the smelter, with the intention that it would eventually be an entity separate from the parent companies.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, China {{was the top}} {{producer}} of white arsenic with almost 70% world share, followed by Morocco, Russia, and Belgium, according to the British Geological Survey and the United States Geological Survey. Most arsenic refinement operations in the US and Europe have closed over environmental concerns. Arsenic is found of the smelter dust from copper, gold, and <b>lead</b> <b>smelters,</b> and is recovered primarily from copper refinement dust.|$|R
5000|$|In 1972, MIM instituted an {{air quality}} {{monitoring}} system in Mount Isa, shutting down the smelter operations whenever the meteorological conditions were considered likely to lead the sulfur dioxide levels to exceed the USEPA standards within the city of Mount Isa. The air quality control system (known as the [...] "AQC system") resulted {{in the loss of}} about 15% of the <b>lead</b> <b>smelter's</b> production and about 7.7% of copper production.|$|R
50|$|The Cottonwood Charcoal Kilns, {{traditional}} {{stone masonry}} 'beehive' charcoal kilns, were built to transform wood from trees in Cottonwood Canyon above the lake into charcoal, {{to feed the}} Cerro Gordo mines' silver and <b>lead</b> <b>smelters</b> across the lake at Swansea. The ruins are located on the southern side of the lakebed near Cartago. They were similar to the nearby Panamint Charcoal Kilns near Death Valley. The kilns are identified as California Historical Landmark #537.|$|R

2500|$|With the {{discovery}} of rich silver-, lead- and zinc-bearing ore at Broken Hill in 1883, and {{the completion of a}} narrow gauge railway from Port Pirie to close to the Broken Hill field in 1888, the economic activities of the town shifted. In 1889 a <b>lead</b> <b>smelter</b> was built by the British Blocks company to treat Broken Hill ore. Broken Hill Proprietary initially leased the smelter from British Blocks and then began constructing their own smelter from 1892. In 1915 the smelter was taken over by a major joint venture of Broken Hill-based companies, Broken Hill Associated Smelters (BHAS). Led by the Collins House Group, BHAS became the biggest <b>lead</b> <b>smelter</b> in the world by 1934. [...] The smelter gradually passed to Pasminco, then Zinifex, and is now operated by Nyrstar.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess, by {{updating}} {{a follow-up}} mortality {{study of a}} <b>lead</b> <b>smelters</b> cohort in Sardinia, Italy, the adverse health effects following occupational lead exposure {{in relation to the}} glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) polymorphism. Method: The 1973 - 2003 mortality of 1017 male <b>lead</b> <b>smelters</b> were followed-up, divided into two subcohorts according to the G 6 PD phenotype: whether G 6 PD deficient (G 6 PD-) or wild-type (wtG 6 PD). Deaths observed in the overall cohort and the two subcohorts were compared with those expected, {{on the basis of the}} age-, sex- and calendar year-specific mortality in the general male population of the island. Directly standardised mortality rates (sr) in the two subcohorts were also compared. RESULTS: Cardiovascular mortality was strongly reduced among production and maintenance workers, which is most related to the healthy worker effect. However, the sr for cardiovascular diseases was substantially lower among the G 6 PD- subcohort (5. 0 x 10 (- 4)) than among the wtG 6 PD subcohort (33. 6 x 10 (- 4); chi 2 = 1. 10; p = NS).
