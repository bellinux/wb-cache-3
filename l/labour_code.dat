The Philippine government encouraged this labour export to reduce the unemployment rate and enrich its treasury with the workers' remittances. The economy of the Philippines became increasingly dependent on labour export; in 1978 labour-export recruiting agencies were privatised, and became a cornerstone of the economy.|$|E

40|$|<b>Labour</b> <b>codes</b> {{of conduct}} and <b>labour</b> policy <b>codes</b> are two legal {{instruments}} which employers have {{at their disposal}} to regulate stakeholder relations (workers, suppliers and customers). Yet their purpose is often unclear. <b>Labour</b> <b>codes</b> of conduct apply to suppliers, worker¿s suppliers and customers. They are also regarded as soft law initiatives {{and this is why}} some difficulties arise when they are challenged in court. Conversely, <b>labour</b> policy <b>codes</b> concern employees and are fully enforceable. The problem stems from the terminology employed to refer to them, which makes it particularly difficult to draw a distinction. Accordingly, this paper seeks to clarify the differences between these two codes considering their features, the applicable rules, and their scope of application...|$|R

25|$|When the {{employers}} {{were asked about}} the kafala system, 55.8% wanted the system to change. The {{reason for this is}} that {{the employers}} felt that the burden was too high on them.

A large amount of the employers even felt that the migrant workers should not be included in the Lebanese <b>labour</b> <b>code,</b> out of fear of the expansion of these rights to other foreigners like the Syrian or Palestinian refugees.|$|E

25|$|In the Congo Free State, forced labour, {{amounting to}} virtual slavery, was widely used on public works and to compel Africans to gather ivory or wild rubber. Although forced labour in the Belgian Congo was {{abolished}} in theory in 1908, from 1917 {{a system of}} forced cultivation of cotton, coffee and rice was introduced for the peasant population, using their own land. On Belgian-owned estates,a <b>Labour</b> <b>Code</b> introduced in 1922 allowed employers to physically discipline their workers, so supposedly free labour {{was turned into a}} system of forced labour. However, neither the peasants nor estate workers were tenants, so the system was rather different from thangata.|$|E

The change also permitted women, who had previously been barred from working underground in mines by federal regulation even though the provincial law permitted them, to work underground for the first time.|$|E

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of self-regulation to promote corporate social responsibility, with {{codes of conduct}} as most common means, {{continues to be the}} subject of widespread interest. This article explores the {{effectiveness of}} corporate codes of conduct, focusing on the issue of child labour. This issue is all the more pronounced, because a strict approach, involving firing child workers or terminating relationships with suppliers that employ them, does not change underlying causes. Effectiveness is explored by a close examination of the nature of child <b>labour</b> <b>codes</b> of six pioneering international garment companies, and by a survey among a focus group of opinion leaders in companies and stakeholders, who were asked for their views on the different dilemmas surrounding <b>codes</b> and child <b>labour.</b> Overall, our research shows that corporate codes are considered to be important, though not the only instruments for addressing child labour. Possible negative side effects and limitations of codes are not seen as crucial factors that harm their effectiveness. Codes must be specific, strictly implemented and monitored, and combined with alternative arrangements for under-age child workers. The importance of a supply-chain approach and attention for the host-country context is recognized. But this also raises many difficult dilemmas concerning the boundaries of corporate social responsibility, which the article examines in more detail.

25|$|Many of {{the most}} {{important}} rights were codified in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union in 2000. While the UK has opted out of direct application of the Charter, this has little practical relevance since the Charter merely reflected pre-existing principles and the Court of Justice uses the Charter to interpret all EU law. For example, in Test-Achats ASBL v Conseil des ministres, the Court of Justice held that Equal Treatment in Goods and Services Directive 2004 article 5(2), which purported to allow a derogation from equal treatment, so men and women could be charged different car insurance rates, was unlawful. It contravened the principle of equality in CFREU 2000 articles 21 and 23, and had to be regarded as ineffective after a transition period. By contrast, in Deutsches Weintor eG v Land Rheinland-Pfalz wine producers claimed that a direction to stop marketing their brands as 'easily digestible' (bekömmlich) by the state food regulator (acting under EU law) contravened their right to occupational and business freedom under CFREU 2000 articles 15 and 16. The Court of Justice held that in fact, the right to health for consumers in article 35 has also to be taken into account, and was to be given greater weight, particularly given the health effects of alcohol. Some rights in the Charter, however, are not expressed with sufficient clarity to be regarded as directly binding. In AMS v Union locale des syndicats CGT a French trade union claimed that the French <b>Labour</b> <b>Code</b> should not exclude casual workers from counting toward the right to set up a work council that an employing entity must inform and consult. They said this contravened the Information and Consultation of Employees Directive and also CFREU article 27. The Court of Justice agreed that the French <b>Labour</b> <b>Code</b> was incompatible with the Directive, but held that article 27 was expressed too generally to create direct rights. On this view, legislation was necessary to make abstract human rights principles concrete, and legally enforceable.|$|E
25|$|Until today Lebanon did {{not sign}} ILO {{convention}} No. 87, the Freedom of Association and Protection {{of the right}} to Organize, which states in Article 2 that no prior registration with government officials is needed to form a labour union. Article 86 of the Lebanese <b>Labour</b> <b>Code</b> however specifically states the need for authorization prior to trade union formation. Since there is no deadline for Ministry of Labour to either approve or disapprove the formation of a trade union the authorization process has been criticized to be depended on the political affiliation of the ministers of labour in charge. Article 4 of the Labour Law, and Decree No. 7993 of 1952 list domestic workers as one group of workers who are barred from forming trade unions. Even though article 7 and article 92 allows foreigners to join a union, they are denied to vote for trade union representatives and being elected into such a position.|$|E
25|$|Decrees {{were made}} in January 1982 {{concerning}} official recognition of persons and bodies responsible for noise monitoring, the monitoring of carbon monoxide and benzene levels in the atmosphere at workplaces, and the inspection of electrical installations. A decree issued in February 1982 laid down safety measures to be taken against electrical hazards arising during the construction, operation and maintenance of electric power distribution installations. A decree issued by the Minister of Labour in March 1982 specified the offices responsible for carrying out the technical tests on particularly dangerous machinery (listed in a decree of April 1981) which are required before the machinery can be officially approved. It also specified the {{information to be provided}} by the person applying for official approval. A decree of May 1982 contained provisions on the setting up, restructuring, organization, financing and tasks of occupational health services in agricultural undertakings and listed those agricultural undertakings for which special medical surveillance is required. Another decree, made that same month, contained new regulations governing health, safety and preventive health measures in public undertakings. It laid down detailed health and safety requirements and specified how these were to be met. It also contained provisions on training in the area, medical surveillance, and health and safety services. Two Orders of July 1982 amended the rules applicable to fixed-term contracts and temporary work with the intention of restricting the use of casual labour and improving the living and working conditions of workers in insecure jobs. A law of July 1982 concerning the spouses of craftsmen and tradesmen employed in the family business amended the provisions of the <b>labour</b> <b>code,</b> social security system, civil code and company law to establish an occupational status for this group of people. In June 1982, a new popular savings book paying index-linked interest was introduced, under which Individuals domiciled for tax purposes in France and whose tax liability was under FF 1 000 were entitled to hold a maximum of FF 10000 (FF 20000 for households) savings in that scheme. Also in 1982, holidays for the low-paid were encouraged by an extension of holiday Vouchers (Cheques-Vacances), subsidized by the employer and requiring regular saving out of earnings. A banking law of January 1984 entitled individuals lacking current accounts who had been refused by three banks to ask the Bank of France to designate a bank or the postal bank to provide them with free accounts.|$|E

2500|$|Arguing {{in favor}} of a Romanian {{communist}} society during the late 1940s, Pătrășcanu indicated a series of essential steps to this goal: after discarding all legislation passed by the Ion Antonescu regime and purging the administrative apparatus, a political amnesty was to be declared, all properties upwards of 50 hectares were to be confiscated, the National Bank passed into state property while trade unions came under government supervision and a new <b>labour</b> <b>code</b> was enforced, and civil liberties were enhanced. Ultimately, a new people's democratic government was to be imposed, removing all forms of antisemitism and chauvinism from public discourse and preserving good relations with the Soviet Union.

2500|$|In France, {{both the}} Criminal Code and the Labor Code are {{relevant}} to the issue of sexual harassment.

Since 2002, it recognized the possibility of sexual harassment between co-workers and not only by supervisors. On May 4, 2012, the [...] (French Supreme Court) quashed the definition of the criminal code as being too vague. The 2012 decision resulted from a law on priority preliminary rulings on the issue of constitutionality. As a consequence of this decision, all pending procedures before criminal courts were cancelled. Several feminist NGOs, such as AFVT, criticized this decision. President François Hollande, the Minister of Justice (Christine Taubira) and the Minister of Equality (Najat Belkacem) asked that a new law be voted rapidly. As a result, LOI n°2012-954 du 6 août 2012 was voted in, providing a new definition. In addition to criminal provisions, the French Labor code also prohibits sexual harassment. The legislator voted a law in 2008 that copied the 2002/73/EC Directive definition without modifying the French <b>Labour</b> <b>Code.</b>|$|E

These changes included secularization of the education and health care systems, which were both heavily controlled by the Roman Catholic Church, whose support for Duplessis and his perceived corruption had angered many Québécois. Policies of the Liberal government also sought to give Quebec more economic autonomy, such as the nationalization of Hydro-Québec and the creation of public companies for the mining, forestry, iron/steel and petroleum industries of the province. Other changes included the creation of the Régie des Rentes du Québec (Quebec Pension Plan) and new <b>labour</b> <b>codes</b> that made unionizing easier and gave workers the right to strike.|$|R
