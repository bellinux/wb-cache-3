5|$|A {{tall and}} thin off spinner, Trumble {{delivered}} the ball at a quicker pace than most spin bowlers, using his height and uncommonly <b>long</b> <b>fingers</b> to his greatest advantage. He was at his best on the softer pitches of England, but his accuracy and variations in pace enabled him to take wickets on the harder pitches of Australia. He was a dependable lower order batsman and a fine fielder in the slips. He was recognised as a shrewd thinker about the game and was popular with team-mates and opponents, {{with a penchant for}} practical jokes.|$|E
5|$|Orangutan {{hands are}} similar to human hands; they have four <b>long</b> <b>fingers</b> and an opposable thumb. However, the joint and tendon {{arrangement}} in the orangutans' hands produces two adaptations that are significant for arboreal locomotion. The resting configuration of the fingers is curved, creating a suspensory hook grip. Additionally, {{without the use of}} the thumb, the fingers and hands can grip tightly around objects with a small diameter by resting the tops of the fingers against the inside of the palm, creating a double-locked grip.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinctive}} dromaeosaurid {{body plan}} helped to rekindle theories {{that at least}} some dinosaurs may have been active, fast, and closely related to birds. Robert Bakker's illustration for John Ostrom's 1969 monograph, showing the dromaeosaurid Deinonychus in a fast run, is among the most influential paleontological reconstructions in history. The dromaeosaurid body plan includes a relatively large skull, serrated teeth, narrow snout, and forward-facing eyes which indicate some degree of binocular vision. Dromaeosaurids, like most other theropods, had a moderately long S-curved neck, and their trunk was relatively short and deep. Like other maniraptorans, they had long arms that could be folded against the body in some species, and relatively large hands with three <b>long</b> <b>fingers</b> (the middle finger being the longest and the first finger being the shortest) ending in large claws. The dromaeosaurid hip structure featured a characteristically large pubic boot projecting beneath the base of the tail. Dromaeosaurid feet bore a large, recurved claw on the second toe. Their tails were slender, with long, low, vertebrae lacking transverse process and neural spines after the 14th caudal vertebra.|$|E
50|$|The middle <b>finger,</b> <b>long</b> <b>finger,</b> or tall finger is {{the third}} digit of the human hand, located between the index finger and the ring finger. It is usually the <b>longest</b> <b>finger.</b> In anatomy, it is also called the third finger, digitus medius, digitus tertius, or digitus III.|$|R

25|$|The pad-to-pad pinch {{between the}} {{thumb and index}} finger is made {{possible}} because of the human ability to passively hyperextend the distal phalanx of the index finger. Most non-human primates have to flex their <b>long</b> <b>fingers</b> in order for the small thumb to reach them.|$|E
25|$|Another {{aspect of}} Paganini's violin {{techniques}} concerned his flexibility. He had exceptionally <b>long</b> <b>fingers</b> and {{was capable of}} playing three octaves across four strings in a hand span, an extraordinary feat even by today's standards. His seemingly unnatural ability {{may have been a}} result of Marfan syndrome.|$|E
25|$|After he regains {{his body}} in the fourth book, Rowling {{describes}} Voldemort as having pale skin, a chalk-white, skull-like face, snake-like slits for nostrils, red eyes and cat-like slits for pupils, a skeletally thin body and long, thin hands with unnaturally <b>long</b> <b>fingers.</b> As mentioned in {{the first chapter of}} the seventh book, he also has no hair or lips. Earlier in life, as seen through flashbacks contained in the second and sixth books, Tom Marvolo Riddle was handsome and tall with pale skin, jet black hair, and dark brown eyes. He could charm many people with his looks. The transformation into his monstrous state {{is believed to have been}} the result of creating his Horcruxes and becoming less human as he continued to divide his soul. In the films, Voldemort's eyes are blue with round pupils.|$|E

500|$|Rivera's {{signature}} pitch was a cut fastball or [...] "cutter", which exhibited {{lateral movement}} towards left-handed hitters {{similar to that}} of a slider but with the velocity of a fastball. The sharp, late movement of Rivera's cutter prevented hitters from making contact with the ball on the sweet spot of their bats, leading to them not only making weak contact on batted balls but also frequently breaking their bats; according to a tally by columnist Buster Olney, Rivera broke 44bats during the 2001 regular season. Chipper Jones, who once witnessed teammate Ryan Klesko break three bats in one plate appearance against Rivera in the 1999 World Series, called the pitch a [...] "buzz saw". Rivera's <b>long</b> <b>fingers</b> and loose wrist contributed to the pitch's movement, allowing him to impart more spin on the ball. Describing his grip of the cutter, he said, [...] "it's really a four-seam fastball with pressure on the middle finger". By adjusting the pressure that he applied to the ball with his fingertips, he could vary the pitch's movement. Rivera threw four-seam and two-seam fastballs as complementary pitches but primarily used his cutter; according to baseball statistics website Fangraphs, 83.3% of his pitches in 2010 were cutters. All three pitches typically reached a velocity in the low-to-mid 90smph.|$|E
2500|$|In his {{autobiography}} A Chef's Tale, Pierre Franey relates how when Voronoff dined at Le Pavillon in the 1940s, waiters would remark how [...] "he {{looked like a}} monkey himself, with his exceptionally <b>long</b> <b>fingers</b> and slouching walk. They would laugh {{at him in the}} kitchen and imitate his walk for those of us (in the kitchen) who couldn't witness it ourselves." ...|$|E
2500|$|Erik, {{the main}} character, is not listed {{as having a}} last name. Erik was born in 1831 in Boscherville, France, and lived until 1881, where {{he died in the}} catacombs beneath the Opera Garnier, where he had lived in what is {{referred}} to as [...] "The House on the Lake," [...] the lake being, in this case, Lake Averne. Erik {{is said to have been}} unspeakably ugly, with sunken mismatched eyes that were not unlike a cat's, incredibly gaunt features, and no nose. Kay keeps to Leroux's original description, depicting Erik as having [...] "sunken, mismatched eyes and grossly malformed lips, a horrible gaping hole where the nose should have been." [...] Erik is also skeletally thin, tall, and with abnormally <b>long</b> <b>fingers</b> which are possessed of an inhuman dexterity. He wears a full-mask at nearly all times, along with expensively tailored clothes and gloves, to hide his frightening appearance. He is also cold to the touch. He seems to have little or no sexual experience or outlet; most women are frightened or disgusted by his appearance, sometimes with fatal results (see description of Luciana below), and he was nearly raped as a young boy. Kay's Erik suffers from violent mood swings and depression, and over the course of the book, through various tragedies and a morphine addiction, he slowly loses what sanity he possessed.|$|E
