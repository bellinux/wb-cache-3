50|$|<b>Yellow</b> <b>slugs,</b> {{like the}} {{majority}} of other land slugs, use two pairs of tentacles on their heads to sense their environment. The upper pair, called optical tentacles, is used to sense light. The lower pair, oral tentacles, provide the slug's sense of smell. Both pairs can retract and extend themselves to avoid hazards, and, if lost to an accident or predation, can be regrown.|$|R
40|$|High-density genetic {{maps are}} {{essential}} for genome assembly, comparative genomic analysis and fine mapping of complex traits. In this study, 31, 191 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) evenly distributed across the <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> croaker (Larimichthys crocea) genome were identified using restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq). Among them, 10, 150 high-confidence SNPs were assigned to 24 consensus linkage groups (LGs). The total length of the genetic linkage map was 5451. 3 cM with an average distance of 0. 54 cM between loci. This represents the densest genetic map currently reported for <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> croaker. Using 2889 SNPs to target specific scaffolds, we assigned 533 scaffolds, comprising 421. 44 Mb (62. 04 %) of the <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> croaker assembled sequence, to the 24 linkage groups. The mapped assembly scaffolds in <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> croaker were used for genome synteny analyses against the stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and medaka (Oryzias latipes). Greater synteny was observed between <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> croaker and stickleback. This supports the hypothesis that <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> croaker is {{more closely related to}} stickleback than to medaka. Moreover, 1274 immunity-related genes and 195 hypoxia-related genes were mapped to the 24 chromosomes of <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> croaker. The integration of the high-resolution genetic map and the assembled sequence provides a valuable resource for fine mapping and positional cloning of quantitative trait loci associated with economically important traits in <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> croaker...|$|R

40|$|Yellow tea {{has been}} widely {{recognized}} for its health benefits. However, its effects and mechanism are largely unknown. The current study investigated the mechanism of dietary supplements of <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> tea {{and its effects on}} metabolic syndrome and the hepatic steatosis in male db/db mice. Our data showed that dietary supplements of <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> tea and water extract significantly reduced water intake and food consumption, lowered the serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and significantly reduced blood glucose level and increased glucose tolerance in db/db mice when compared to untreated db/db mice. In addition, the dietary supplement of <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> tea prevented the fatty liver formation and restored the normal hepatic structure of db/db mice. Furthermore, the dietary supplement of <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> tea obviously reduced the lipid synthesis related to gene fatty acid synthase, the sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 and acetyl-CoA carboxylase α, as well as fatty acid synthase and sterol response element-binding protein 1 expression, while the lipid catabolic genes were not altered in the liver of db/db mice. This study substantiated that the dietary supplement of <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> tea has potential as a food additive for ameliorating type 2 diabetes-associated symptoms...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} the fatty acid profiles of muscle from <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> croaker (Pseudosciaena crocea R.) of different age. One- and two-year-old fish were cultured in floating net cages and sampled randomly for analysis. Moisture, protein, lipid and ash contents {{were determined by}} methods of Association of Analytical Chemist (AOAC) International. Fatty acid profile was determined by gas chromatography. Crude protein, fat, moisture and ash contents showed {{no significant differences between}} the two age groups. The contents of total polyunsaturated fatty acids and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were significantly higher and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) content was significantly lower in the two-year-old <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> croaker than in the one-year-old (P< 0. 05). No significant differences were observed in the contents of total saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids, or the ratio of n- 3 /n- 6 fatty acids among the <b>large</b> <b>yellow</b> croakers of the two age groups.

5000|$|There is a {{positive}} correlation between ornamental cues and the parental care invested in Iberian rock sparrows (Vincente Garcia-Navas). Males show more parental effort if their female mate has a <b>larger</b> <b>yellow</b> chest patch. Also, larger nestlings belonged to those who had males with <b>larger</b> <b>yellow</b> chest patches. There is also a connection between a <b>larger</b> <b>yellow</b> breast patch and higher parental effort but only from the males. Males who mated with females with a bigger yellow chest had a higher rate of visiting their offspring. Bigger males bred later and fed their young more than their smaller counterparts. Larger males are not in a hurry to mate because they are in better condition and can weigh their options. (Rikón, Amanda Garcia Del) ...|$|R
