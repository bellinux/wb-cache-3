40|$|The article {{presents}} {{the attitude of}} grammar school students towards the art curriculum. It first {{provides an overview of}} the characteristics of contemporary art education, with an emphasis on the postmodern art curriculum and on <b>linking</b> <b>course</b> content with students’ interests. The study is based on the descriptive and causal non-experimental method, with a sample comprising 387 Slovenian, Estonian and Portuguese students. It was established that the students place the highest value on developing creativity, and are less interested in art history content and learning about the basics of the formal art language. They are attracted to contemporary topics, such as graffiti, multicultural art, the use of new media, and digital technologies. The results of the study provide opportunities for future comparative analyses and starting points for updating art curricula. (DIPF/Orig. ...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe increased availability {{and use of}} online devices has the Marine Corps College of Distance Education and Training (CDET) looking at Experience API (xAPI) for {{ways to improve the}} accessibility, effectiveness, and efficiency of the educational instruction they provide. This thesis recommends a way for CDET to incorporate xAPI into the courseware currently delivered by their learning management system (LMS), MarineNet. Research was conducted into how learning objectives, online assessments, and xAPI can create a learning objective performance value (a measurement of a student's proficiency in a specific learning objective). A prototype system consisting of a LMS, Learning Record Store (LRS), and xAPI courseware was developed, and learning experiences <b>linking</b> <b>course</b> assessment questions to learning objectives were extracted to the LRS. The learning experiences were then analyzed to calculate learning objective performance values, which provide the ability to determine students' strengths and weaknesses in specific subject areas. This enables tailored curriculums that allow time and resources to be spent in subject areas that most benefit the student and the Marine Corps, while maximizing the effectiveness and efficiency of their e-learning courseware.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{learning}} gains {{has had a}} wider coverage internationally but is fairly new to the UK (HEFCE 2015). This session introduces learning gains (LGS) {{in the context of}} HE and compares these to learning outcomes and value-added. It critically evaluates methods for measuring LGS and will focus on student e-portfolios and reflective accounts as evidence of PPD and LGS. We introduce the wider spectrum of learning opportunities within Bournemouth University (BU), including extra-curriculum activities such as the university Global Talent programme, the staff-student collaboration competitions, SUBU clubs and societies, and the Student Project Bank as hubs for social and experiential learning. We analyse these and synthesise the findings into the precepts of a strategy for maximizing learning gains. It is illustrated through the lived experiences of a BU student, who talks about his journey as undergraduate Business School student who demonstrates how classes have inspired his business visions and further engagement with experiential and social learning through co-curriculum and extra-curriculum activities. We present elements of his e-portfolios and other artifacts evidencing his PPD attainment. Building on student and academic reflections, we discuss opportunities for collaboration in an international study on LGS and employability. Our conclusion focuses on the appreciation of how personalisation of education could be achieved through <b>linking</b> <b>course</b> studies with extra-curriculum activities, thus fusing formal, social and experiential learning, as we as on the role of reflective accounts and e-portfolios as evidence of learning gains and student employability...|$|E

Fifty-four first year university students in three separate pairs of courses worked in teams to pre-sent oral critical reports on texts related to the Reformation, the Enlightenment, and the Modern Era: themes intersecting religion and history.

40|$|Recent {{interest}} in learning communities indicates appreciation {{for the value of}} interdisciplinary study. Learning communities are "supportive settings which require students to share the experience of learning with others " (Tinto, 1998). Research suggests that learning communities are useful for several reasons. They result in more intellectual interaction among students and between students and faculty members. They increase student involvement and create a sense of community. The programs show impressive results in terms of student academic achievement, student intellectual development, retention, and student motivation. Learning communities increase curricular coherence and provide ample opportunities for the integration and reinforcement of ideas. They promote an understanding of complex issues that cross disciplinary boundaries (Smith, 1991). One type of learning community is that created through <b>linked</b> <b>courses.</b> What Are <b>Linked</b> <b>Courses?</b> Kellogg (1999) states that <b>linked</b> <b>courses</b> put together a cohort of students with two common courses. One course is typically content-based (science, math) and the other is an application course (writing, speech). The faculty of each course may teach independently or together and coordinate syllabi and assignments so that the classes compliment each other. The <b>Linked</b> <b>Courses</b> Model provides a shared experience for students that focuses on a content-based course that is actively supported by a skills <b>course.</b> <b>Links</b> have been formed between many kinds of academic disciplines: ESL and Speec...|$|R

5000|$|The {{style of}} play on a <b>links</b> golf <b>course</b> is {{considerably}} different from the {{style of play}} on other types of courses. The challenges of links golf fall into two categories: Firstly, {{the nature of the}} courses themselves, which tend to be characterised by uneven fairways, thick rough, and small, deep bunkers known as [...] "pot bunkers"; and secondly, due to their coastal location and lack of trees, many <b>links</b> <b>courses</b> are frequently windy. This affects the style of play required, favouring players who are able to play low accurate shots. As many <b>links</b> <b>courses</b> consist of an [...] "outward" [...] nine in one direction along the coast, and an [...] "inward" [...] nine which returns in the opposite direction, players often have to cope with opposite wind patterns in each half of their round. As a result, successful links golfers learn to control the trajectory of their shots by playing a lower ball flight. Greens on <b>links</b> <b>courses</b> tend to be free of fronting hazards, allowing golfers to bounce the golf ball into the green, rather than hitting high approach shots with strong backspin.|$|R

50|$|Muirfield has {{an unusual}} layout for a <b>links</b> <b>course.</b> Most <b>links</b> <b>courses</b> {{run along the}} coast and then back again leading to two sets of nine holes, the holes in each set facing roughly in the same direction. Muirfield, however, {{was among the first}} courses to depart from this {{arrangement}} and is arranged as two loops of nine holes, one clockwise, one anticlockwise. This means that, assuming the wind direction remains the same throughout a round, every hole on the course has a different apparent wind direction from the tee. No more than three consecutive holes follow the same direction at any stage.|$|R
