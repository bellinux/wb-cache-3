5|$|In {{spite of}} this initial mishap, De Sotos first capture did not take long, as she and a bluejacket-crewed <b>lugger</b> took {{schooner}} Major Barbour off Isles Dernières, Louisiana on 28 January 1862. Cmdr. Walker's crew discovered 8 barrels of gunpowder and 198 cases of gunpowder, nitrates, sulfur, and percussion caps in the blockade runner. On 8 February, the steamer caught the small schooner Star out of Bayou Lafourche, taking her four-man crew prisoner.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} {{selected for}} the reinforcement of Egypt was placed {{under the command of}} Contre-amiral Honoré Ganteaume, a survivor of the Battle of the Nile and therefore an officer with experience of service in the Eastern Mediterranean. Under Ganteaume's command were three 80-gun and four 74-gun ships of the line, two frigates and a <b>lugger</b> which between them carried 5,000 troops as reinforcements for the Army in Egypt under General Jean Sahuguet. Rumours were spread that the expedition was destined for the Caribbean to oppose the Haitian Revolution, and demonstrations were arranged at every French Atlantic and Channel port, intended to confuse the British blockade squadrons as to which ships were actually sailing and which were only giving the impression of doing so. Ganteaume's squadron was ordered to sail from Brest on 7 January 1801, but the diversion plan was not successful, as the British squadron that was permanently maintained off Brest under Rear-Admiral Henry Harvey immediately gave chase to Ganteauame's ships as they emerged from the Passage du Raz. Within hours, Ganteaume had been forced to take shelter under the batteries {{at the mouth of the}} River Vilaine, pretending that his voyage had only been a feint like the other operations along the coast. A few days later he managed to slip back into Brest harbour.|$|E
25|$|On 9 May Spitfire {{brought a}} {{smuggling}} <b>lugger</b> called Providence into Plymouth. The <b>lugger</b> had a cargo of 90 s of spirits and 26 bales of tobacco.|$|E
50|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, the Australian government impounded all pearling <b>luggers</b> in North Australia, including the Paspaley <b>luggers,</b> for fear they {{could be used by}} the Japanese army for invasion. The <b>luggers</b> were consequently destroyed on the beaches.|$|R
50|$|Nicholas Paspaley had {{purchased}} four <b>luggers</b> {{which had been}} abandoned during the war by the Royal Australian Navy on Darwin's beaches. Once again, after rebuilding the <b>luggers,</b> Nicholas resumed pearling out of Darwin. However, {{the invention of the}} plastic button in the mid 1950s reduced demand for mother-of-pearl shell, virtually devastating the industry overnight, with the fleets of pearling <b>luggers</b> abandoned once more on the beaches.|$|R
50|$|The attackers heavily outnumbered the Danes, {{who also}} {{were not as}} {{experienced}} at close combat. As soon as the enemy came into sight Skibsted brought his <b>luggers</b> {{as close to the}} shore as he could. Unfortunately, the <b>luggers</b> could not get near enough to land to be well-supported by the soldiers. The British opened fire on the <b>luggers</b> with grape shot from the carronades and with small-arms fire, which the Danes could only return with their howitzers and small arms, as they were unable to bring the luggers’ guns to bear on the British boats.|$|R
25|$|The last attack {{occurred}} on 11 April. Sylvia sighted a <b>lugger</b> proa at anchor under Krakatoa that got under weigh as the British approached. Drury sent Sub-Lieutenant Chesnaye and another party of volunteers in the proa that Sylvia had captured on 7 April. As the British proa approached the <b>lugger,</b> the <b>lugger</b> took flight and both proas passed behind an island that shielded them from Sylvias sight. When Sylvia {{finally caught up}} with the two, the British were about to board the pirate <b>lugger</b> proa, which was putting up a stiff resistance. Sylvia opened fire on the enemy until the <b>lugger</b> sank. She had been armed with three 18-pounders and had had a crew of 72 men; pirate casualties were unknown. The British suffered eight men severely wounded, one of whom later died.|$|E
25|$|Then on 30 July, she, with Boston in company, {{captured}} the French privateer <b>lugger</b> Hazard of eight guns and 50 men. Hazard was from Bayonne, {{but on this}} cruise she had last left Corunna. She had made no captures. Then on 13 August Aigle {{captured the}} French privateer <b>lugger</b> La Manche (or La Mouche), of eight guns and eight swivel guns, and 49 men. She was 13 days out of Nantes and had made no captures. She was sent into Lisbon and sold there. Four days later, Tyler observed two vessels sailing out of the Bay of Lax. He ordered his <b>lugger</b> to cut them out. The weather prevented the <b>lugger</b> from bringing one out, a brig, so Tyler had her cargo of rice taken out and then burnt the vessel, which was Spanish, bound for Corunna.|$|E

25|$|Between 13 and 26 February, Warren's {{squadron}} {{captured and}} sent to England the following vessels: the sloop Petit Jean, the brig St. Pierre, the brig Deux Frères, the ship Petite Magdalène, the packet boat De Cayene, the schooner Curieuse (Coureuse), the <b>lugger</b> Liberté, the <b>lugger</b> Gloire, and the brig transport Biche. The squadron burned seven vessels: the schooner brig Désirée, the brig Three Friends, the brig Trois Frères, the brig Guerrier, the brig Liberté, the brig Espérance, and the <b>lugger</b> Patriote. The British scuttled four brigs:Graley, Jean et Marie, Pierre, and Anne. In all, Warren's squadron had taken nine prizes and destroyed 11 vessels.|$|E
5000|$|In 1798 Lieutenant Robert (or Richard) Young came {{to command}} Ann. On 31 January 1798 she {{captured}} the fishing boat Leopold. On 28 March she captured Greffwen, of Gothland. On 20 July {{she was in}} company with [...] when they captured the <b>luggers</b> Mayflower and William. At some point she also captured the <b>luggers</b> Joseph and Edward.|$|R

50|$|The fifth patrol {{originated}} from Midway on 26 April and took Plaice to the Kuril Islands-Okhotsk Sea area. The first enemy contact {{was made on}} 13 May, when the submarine trailed four sea trucks and four small <b>luggers</b> until she opened a surface engagement with her 5 in and 40 mm guns, sinking all four sea trucks and two <b>luggers.</b>|$|R
25|$|Hound and {{the hired}} armed <b>lugger</b> Black Joke {{captured}} the Minerva on 16 May.|$|E
25|$|Then on 19 May, Cruizer was six {{or seven}} leagues SE by S off Lowestoff when she {{encountered}} two French privateer luggers. During the chase one lost her main and foremast and struck. Cruizer continued in chase of the other until 5pm {{when it became clear}} that the quarry was gaining, and Wollaston was losing sight of the <b>lugger</b> that had struck. He therefore gave up the chase and returned to the first <b>lugger.</b> She was Chasseur, from Honfleur, and had been out eight days without taking anything. She was armed with four 6-pounder guns and had a crew of 48 men. The <b>lugger</b> that escaped was Dragon, of four 6-pounder guns. The two luggers had left Honfleur together and were going to cruise the Dogger Bank.|$|E

40|$|Title {{devised by}} {{cataloguer}} {{based on information}} from acquisition file number 204 / 02 / 00071.; Condition: Good.; Photograph signed by artist on verso.; Part of the collection of photographs of pearl shells at Broome, Western Australia by Roger Garwood. "Pearl shell, unloaded from <b>luggers</b> using a block and tackle, is loaded onto a trolley mounted on a small rail track. The sacks of shell are pushed along the jetty to a sorting shed, visible {{in the background of}} the picture to the left had {i. e. hand} side of the jetty (beside the white gloved hand of the crewman). The trolley has recently been recovered from Broome's rubbish tip by Steve Arrow of the Arrow Pearling Company and is on display as part of a tourist precinct, "The Luggers". The <b>luggers</b> in this image and the previous image have a slightly raised bow section and were among the last of the traditional <b>luggers</b> built for the Streeter and Male company. The raised bow section was to ensure that Australian crew members, who later worked on the <b>luggers,</b> had sufficient head room while below decks. Earlier <b>luggers</b> employed mixed race crews, predominantly Japanese and Malay, who were considerably shorter in stature. " [...] Notes from artist...|$|R

25|$|Then on 17 April, Favourite {{captured}} a French privateer <b>lugger</b> off Plymouth after a four-hour chase. The <b>lugger</b> was the Antichrist, armed with fourteen 2 and 9-pounder guns.

She was 15 days out of Dunkirk and Favourite recaptured her sole prize, the ship Brotherly Love, of South Shields, which had been sailing to London when she was captured.|$|E
25|$|The British hired armed cutter Sandwich {{was under}} the command of Lieutenant George Lempriere and {{cruising}} off the coast of Barcelona on 14 June 1799 when she sighted a large fleet. Lempriere believed the vessels to be a British fleet and sailed towards them. When the strange vessels did not reply to the recognition signals, Lempriere realized that they were enemy vessels and attempted to sail away. The French fleet detached a <b>lugger,</b> possibly Affronteur, to pursue Sandwich. A frigate joined the <b>lugger</b> in pursuit and towards evening the <b>lugger</b> opened fire with her bow chasers. The frigate then too opened fire, with Sandwich returning fire as best she could. By 1a.m. the frigate was within musket shot of Sandwich and any further resistance would have been futile. Lempriere then struck to Créole.|$|E

2500|$|On 8 June 1808 he {{superseded}} Captain Edward Rotheram {{in command}} of the 74-gun [...] Warren was ordered to join the fleet in the North Sea, blockading the Dutch ports as part of Rear-Admiral Alan Gardner's squadron. By 1809 the strategic situation in the Baltic had deteriorated after Russia signed the Treaties of Tilsit and began to support France. Bellerophon was ordered to join the fleet stationed in the Baltic under Admiral Sir James Saumarez. Saumarez dispatched Bellerophon and [...] north to the Gulf of Finland in June, and on 19 June the two ships came across three suspicious looking <b>luggers,</b> anchored off Hango. The water was too shallow to allow them to approach the <b>luggers,</b> so Warren dispatched a boat party. The British boarded the <b>luggers,</b> but found themselves in a trap, when numerous Russian shore batteries and several gunboats opened fire on them. The British commander promptly ordered the <b>luggers</b> to be burnt, reboarded his men and landed them next to the nearest Russian shore battery. The battery, defended by 100 sailors, was stormed and carried, the British spiked the guns and destroyed the magazine, before returning to the ships with only five men wounded.|$|R
