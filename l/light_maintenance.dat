25|$|The Meredith Avenue Depot or Meredith Depot {{is located}} at 280 and 336 Meredith Avenue, at the {{intersection}} of Meredith Avenue and South Avenue (formerly Chelsea Road) near the shoreline of Arthur Kill and Prall's Island in Chelsea. This depot was constructed in 2009 to expand storage capacity in the borough, with the MTA operating the site on a 15-year lease. The depot was built on largely vacant land, with the exception of an 1890s-era house. It has space for 80 buses, and <b>light</b> <b>maintenance</b> facilities. It operates only from Monday to Friday, and houses exclusively express buses, which are rotated from the other Staten Island depots. Meredith Avenue depot was closed due to damage from Hurricane Sandy, but has since reopened.|$|E

25|$|Increasing {{passenger}} loads soon {{required a}} further {{expansion of the}} carrying capacity of the harbor crossing. A new, four track station and two loops were constructed under Maverick Square in East Boston. The station was constructed while passenger service through the East Boston Tunnel was maintained. The new Maverick station would have the local East Boston streetcars enter the incline as always, but would stop inside the new station. All of the passengers would disembark the trolleys and cross the platform to the waiting rapid transit trains. A loop was provided west of the station for the trolleys {{to turn around and}} return to the outbound side of the station. The rapid transit trains would return to Boston via a loop on {{the eastern side of the}} station. A short extension of the tunnel beyond the east loop provided train storage and a couple of inspection pits for <b>light</b> <b>maintenance.</b>|$|E
25|$|Light-emitting {{phosphors}} {{are applied}} as a paint-like coating {{to the inside}} of the tube. The organic solvents are allowed to evaporate, then the tube is heated to nearly the melting point of glass to drive off remaining organic compounds and fuse the coating to the lamp tube. Careful control of the grain size of the suspended phosphors is necessary; large grains, 35 micrometers or larger, lead to weak grainy coatings, whereas too many small particles 1 or 2 micrometers or smaller leads to poor <b>light</b> <b>maintenance</b> and efficiency. Most phosphors perform best with a particle size around 10 micrometers. The coating must be thick enough to capture all the ultraviolet light produced by the mercury arc, but not so thick that the phosphor coating absorbs too much visible light. The first phosphors were synthetic versions of naturally occurring fluorescent minerals, with small amounts of metals added as activators. Later other compounds were discovered, allowing differing colors of lamps to be made.|$|E
25|$|The Air Ambulance Service of NSW was {{established}} in 1967 with a single Beechcraft Queen Air. More Queen Airs were gradually added so that by 1978 four were operational; these aircraft were {{owned and operated by}} East-West Airlines on behalf of the Service. One aircraft was destroyed by fire at Dubbo in 1982 and a fifth Queen Air was added to replace it. In 1985 a fleet modernisation programme began when the first two of four Beechcraft B200C Super King Airs were purchased to replace the Queen Airs. In 2003 one of the B200Cs was written off following an accident at Coffs Harbour Airport. The aircraft was involved in a CFIT accident; briefly impacting the sea during an instrument approach before making an emergency landing on two remaining wheels. By that time a second re-equipment programme was underway; the remaining three aircraft were replaced that year and in 2004 with four modified B200 King Airs. The latest re-equipment programme in 2012 saw the fixed wing fleet upgraded to seven aircraft comprising both Beechcraft B200 and B350 King Air aircraft. The Air Ambulance base facility is located at Sydney Airport and consists of an aircraft hangar with a <b>light</b> <b>maintenance</b> facility, road ambulance bay, patient care facilities, administration and an area for aircraft parking.|$|E

25|$|On July 9, 2000, Metro-North {{restored}} service between Dover Plains and Wassaic, a {{move the}} railroad billed {{as its first}} service expansion since it was created in 1983. As part of the project, the trailhead of the Harlem Valley Rail Trail was moved from milepoint 81.6 to milepoint 82. 6,152 feet of right-of-way had to be acquired from the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historical Preservation. To make up for this loss, $490,800 was received by the Transportation Enhancement Program to design and construct an access pathway from Wassaic station to the new trailhead. Wassaic was designed as and is a regional transportation hub for people living and going to Dutchess County in New York, Litchfield County in Connecticut and for Western Massachusetts. The station was built with a 250-space parking lot that, with expansion, could have 1000 parking spaces, and with a layover yard, and a <b>light</b> <b>maintenance</b> facility. One {{of the goals of}} the expansion was to provide additional parking capacity for the line. Prior to the opening of the yard at Wassaic, trains terminating at Dover Plains had to deadhead 23 miles to get to the yard at Southeast, reducing capacity on the line, while being very costly. A station was also opened at Tenmile River to serve the Taconic Developmental Disabilities Service Office. Under an alternative plan, this would have been the terminus of the line. In order to build ridership, the extension has received the same amount of service as has the line south of Dover Plains, with four AM and four PM rush hour trains with direct service to Grand Central.|$|E
500|$|The Marines Corps' {{concept for}} {{deploying}} the Harriers in a land-based expeditionary role focused on aggressive speed. Harrier forward bases and <b>light</b> <b>maintenance</b> facilities {{were to be}} set up in under 24 hours on any prospective battle area. The forward bases, containing one to four aircraft, were to be located [...] from the forward edge of battle (FEBA), while a more established permanent airbase would be located around [...] from the FEBA. The close proximity of forward bases allowed for a far greater sortie rate and reduced fuel consumption.|$|E
