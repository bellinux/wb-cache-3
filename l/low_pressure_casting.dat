40|$|The mold {{filling and}} {{solidification}} process of a marine propeller hub were simulated using ProCAST? Three casting processes ?gravity casting, centrifugal casting and <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>casting</b> ?were compared {{in order to}} get the best process. The heat transfer coefficient of the casting/mold interface was determined using a reverse method. The simulated results of velocity, temperature and shrinkage porosity distribution were discussed in detail for the three casting processes. A smooth filling was found in all three casting processes, especially the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>casting</b> exhibiting a better filling performance than the other two, but the solidification processes were different. The casting did not experience the sequential solidification, and the feeding paths were blocked, leading to shrinkage porosity defects in the riser and the bottom of the casting in gravity casting and in the upper zone of the casting in <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>casting.</b> While, the sequential solidification was well controlled in the solidification process of centrifugal casting, and majority of the shrinkage porosity defects can only be observed in the riser. It could be concluded that the centrifugal casting process is the most suitable casting process for the production of propeller hub body. The casting experiments verified the simulation results, and a defect-free propeller hub was obtained by centrifugal casting with a rotational speed of 150 r. in- 1...|$|E

In the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> die <b>casting</b> process is that the permanent die and filling systems are placed over the furnace containing the molten alloy. The filling of the cavity is obtained by forcing the molten metal, by means of a pressurized gas, to rise into a ceramic tube, which connects the die to the furnace.

40|$|Abstract. A novel {{technique}} {{for the production}} of functionally gradient materials, developed by the authors, is presented. The process is known as the Cast-Decant-Cast or CDC process, and involves a partial solidification step. This process takes expensive and time-consuming factors out of the production of functionally gradient materials by enabling utilisation of standard foundry equipment, and the process is carried out in a single multi-step casting operation. The CDC process involves simultaneous but separate melting of two alloys of different composition in order to produce a gradient in material properties. Details of the process are presented. It is shown that the outcome depends on partial local remelting and alloy mixing, which results in a gradual change or gradient {{between the first and second}} alloys in the as-cast condition, hence producing a functionally gradient material. The process has been adapted to conventional casting methods such as gravity casting and <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>casting.</b> It is the method of decanting the first material from the mould that differentiates the process variants. The decanting step for the low pressure method is controlled by pressure application and release on the molten alloys within their respective, but separate, sealed holding chambers. Decanting for the gravity casting method began as a physical inversion of the mould and is now at the point of autodecanting through careful design of an innovative gating system. The CDC process has been proven by means of metallographic study of microstructure to produce functionally gradient materials. Adapting the CDC process to conventional casting methods has made it a potentially commercially viable option for numerous applications. The results of recent research on the process are presented in summary form, including multi-alloy experiments, observations on the influence of timing and thermal control, and FGM manufacture using MMCs and joining dissimilar metals...|$|E
