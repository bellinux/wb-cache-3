He blackmails her into remarrying him as he alludes that he has information on the music box that Katherine once told him. However, his information ends up being a dead end. After Colin's lies are exposed, Jill locks him in the attic and refuses to let him out until he owns up to his lies, which he eventually does and they patch things up. Almost a year after Katherine's death, Jill finds her most expensive jewelry to have been hidden in a chandelier at the Chancellor Estate. Enclosed with a note, Katherine left them there for Jill to find before her death as they are worth a significant amount. However, {{the meaning of the}} music box continues to remain unknown to everyone. Afterward, all of Katherine's loved ones receive letters from her that were to be delivered on the one-year anniversary of her death. She also asks them to throw a party and celebrate, which they do. Once the party in the park is finished, Jill leaves the music box there, only for it to be stolen by an unidentified person. Jill and Colin return soon after to find the box missing, but Colin convinces her to finally <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|Existing {{in a kind}} of Neverland where money {{never came}} in, schemes never stayed out for very long, yet no one living or visiting went wanting, 79 Wistful Vista (the McGees' address from show #20, August 1935 onward) became the home Depression-exhausted Americans visited to remind {{themselves}} that they were not the only ones finding cheer in the middle of struggle and doing their best not to make it overt. The McGees won their house in a raffle from Mr. Hagglemeyer's Wistful Vista Development Company, with lottery ticket #131,313, happened upon by chance while on a pleasure drive in their car. With blowhard McGee wavering between mundane tasks and hare-brained schemes (like digging an oil well in the back yard), antagonizing as many people as possible, and patient Molly indulging his foibles and providing loving support, not to mention a tireless parade of neighbors and friends {{in and out of the}} quiet home, Fibber McGee and Molly built its audience steadily, but once it found the full volume of that audience in 1940, they rarely <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

In {{contrast to the}} relaxed Los Angeles sessions, which Godrich described as [...] "very fruitful", mixing and sequencing the album created conflict. Yorke said: [...] "We had massive arguments {{about how it was}} put together and mixed ... For the first time it was really good fun to make a record... but we finished it and nobody could <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> 'Cause there was a long sustained period during which we lived with it but it wasn't completely finished, so you get attached to versions and we had big rows about it." [...] Godrich estimated that rough mixes from the Los Angeles sessions were used for a third of the final album.|$|E

Mike Patton recently sung on the Secret Chiefs 3 song [...] "La Chanson de Jacky" [...] in 2012 giving further speculation by fans on the chance of a reunion.

It's nothing personal, either. We all feel like that band said what it needed to say. It would feel weird and awkward to play that music again.

[...] When asked about Mr. Bungle reuniting in an interview published in February 2014, Patton responded by saying, [...] "Who knows?

Besides, they were snarling all the time, and his benumbed and drowsy senses no longer took note of changing pitch and intensity. He awoke with a start. The she-wolf was less than a yard from him. Mechanically, at short range, without <b>letting</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> he thrust a brand full into her open and snarling mouth. She sprang away, yelling with pain, and while he took delight in the smell of burning flesh and hair, he watched her shaking her head and growling wrathfully a score of feet away.|$|R

5000|$|Charlie Brown's {{relationships}} with other Peanuts characters initially differed significantly from their later states, and their concepts were grown up through this decade until they reached their more established forms. An example is his relationship with Violet Gray, to whom he was introduced to on the February 7, 1951, strip. The two constantly remained on fairly good terms, a bit different from their now-known relationship. Charlie Brown often fed on Violet's mud pies. On the August 16, 1951, strip, she called Charlie Brown a [...] "blockhead", {{and that is the}} first time Charlie Brown was referred by that insult. November 14 of that year, Charlie Brown is first unable to kick a football, and Violet is responsible because fear of her hand being kicked by Charlie Brown resulted in her <b>letting</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and Charlie Brown being unable to kick it.|$|R

This time, my comrade coiled himself away in a very small space; and enjoining upon him not to draw a single unnecessary breath, I proceeded to urge the canoe along by myself. I was astonished at his docility, never speaking a word, and stirring neither hand nor foot; but the secret was, he was unable to swim, and in case we met with a second mishap, there were no more ledges beneath to stand upon.

40|$|Intertidal {{hermit crabs}} of Puget Sound include Pagurus hirsutiusculus, Pagurus granosimanus, and Pagurus beringanus. The {{behavior}} of Pagurus hirsutiusculus {{differs from that}} of the other two species in terms of shell selection, escape locomotion, and reactions to predators. Measurements of shells and hermit crab’s occupying them were taken. Both P. granosimanus and P. beringanus were found to select crabs four times their body weight while P. hirsutiusculus chose shells that were slightly lighter than it’s body weight. However, gravid females of P. hirsutiusculus choose shells twice their weight. Shell release is a unique behavior in P. hirsutiusculus in which the crab will <b>let</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>it’s</b> shell when picked up the shell and fall out. This behavior was tested for on the other species of the intertidal, but it was found that only a large percentage of P. hirsutiusculus display this behavior. Gravid females of P. hirsutiusculus were less likely to display shell release behavior. Behavior between P. granosimanus and P. hirsutiusculus in presence of a predator was drastically different. P. hirsutiusculus recovered twice as quickly from being startled than P. granosimanus. There {{was no significant difference in}} control or predator water for either hermit crab in Cancer productus water. In Cancer magister water, there was only a significant difference in P. hirsutiusculus which went significantly slower. In P. helianthoides water, only P. granosimanus had significantly different behavior in that it recovered faster than in control water...|$|R

He grinds the bat droppings into powder, but tests it out on a few mini rockets, to no avail, so Ahlo tries urinating on the bat dropping powder (advised by Purple, who said that can make it work better). In the contest, Toma launches his rocket, named Lucky, but <b>lets</b> <b>go</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> too soon and launches it poorly. A champion rocket named The Million is launched afterwards which successfully reaches the clouds. Ahlo brings his rocket in, which he calls The Bat, but the announcer tells him that kids aren't allowed to launch. Ahlo asks Toma to launch it, but Taitko doesn't allow him to, believing that The Bat will blow everyone up because of Ahlo's bad luck. Nobody else volunteers to do so and Ahlo then runs off. Toma decides to launch it anyway. Kia catches up to Ahlo and tells him what his father is doing, and so he runs back to the contest, thinking the rocket will kill Toma, and shouts his apology over the loud roaring of the rocket. The Bat is launched properly this time and it reaches the clouds. The Bat then surprisingly explodes inside the cloud, causing it to rain. Ahlo wins 10 million kip and is now no longer considered cursed.|$|R
