40|$|Abstractâ€”The {{large number}} of <b>latches</b> <b>in</b> current designs {{increase}} the complexity of formal verification and logic synthesis, since the growth of latch number leads the state space to explode exponentially. One {{solution to this problem}} is to find the functional dependencies among these latches. Then, these latches can be identified as dependent latches or essential latches, where the state space can be constructed using only the essential latches. This paper proposes an approach to find the functional dependencies among <b>latches</b> <b>in</b> a sequential circuit by using SAT solvers with the Craig interpolation theorem. In addition, the proposed approach detects sequential functional dependencies existing in the reachable state space only. Experimental results show that our approach could deal with large sequential circuits with up to 1. 5 K <b>latches</b> <b>in</b> a reasonable time and simultaneously identify the combinational and sequential dependent latches.

60|$|Rasmunsen {{followed}} {{him out and}} turned the dogs loose. He threw them all the salmon he had bought, and coiled a sled-lashing up in his hand. Then he re-entered the cabin and drew the <b>latch</b> <b>in</b> after him. The smoke from the cindered steak made his eyes smart. He stood on the bunk, passed the lashing over the ridge-pole, and measured the swing-off with his eye. It {{did not seem to}} satisfy, for he put the stool on the bunk and climbed upon the stool. He drove a noose in the end of the lashing and slipped his head through. The other end he made fast. Then he kicked the stool out from under.|$|E
60|$|That {{next day}} was Wednesday, the twelfth of August. The weather had changed in the night; and the sun rose watery through mist and cloud. By noon the sky was {{overcast}} at all points; the temperature was sensibly colder; and the rain poured down, straight and soft and steady, on the thirsty earth. Toward three o'clock, Miss Garth and Norah entered the morning-room, to await Mr. Pendril's arrival. They were joined shortly afterward by Magdalen. In half an hour more the familiar fall of the iron <b>latch</b> <b>in</b> the socket reached their ears from the fence beyond the shrubbery. Mr. Pendril and Mr. Clare advanced into view along the garden-path, walking arm-in-arm through the rain, sheltered by the same umbrella. The lawyer bowed as they passed the windows; Mr. Clare walked straight on, deep in his own thoughts--noticing nothing.|$|E
60|$|He awoke {{suddenly}} {{and tried to}} leap out of his bunk on {{to the floor and}} hop on one leg as a specific for the cramp. Then, as he realized his position, he strove madly to rise and straighten the afflicted limb. He was so far successful that he managed to stand, and in the fantastic appearance of a human snail, to shuffle slowly round the kitchen. At first he thought only of the cramp, but after that had yielded to treatment a wild idea of escape occurred to him. Still bowed with the chair, {{he made his way to}} the door, and, after two or three attempts, got the <b>latch</b> <b>in</b> his mouth and opened it. Within five minutes he had shuffled his way through the garden gate, which was fortunately open, and reached the road.|$|E

50|$|These {{numbers are}} {{written to the}} DAC, {{typically}} with a clock signal that causes each number to be <b>latched</b> <b>in</b> sequence, at which time the DAC output voltage changes rapidly from the previous value to the value represented by the currently latched number. The effect {{of this is that}} the output voltage is held in time at the current value until the next input number is <b>latched,</b> resulting <b>in</b> a piecewise constant or staircase-shaped output. This is equivalent to a zero-order hold operation and has an effect on the frequency response of the reconstructed signal.|$|R

60|$|Mr. Holiday's three {{rooms were}} {{a small but}} beautifully {{furnished}} parlor, where they had breakfast, and two bed rooms. One bed room was for himself and Mrs. Holiday, {{and the other was}} for Jennie. There were a great many splendid mirrors in these rooms, and other elegant furniture. The floors were not carpeted, but were formed of dark and polished wood, curiously inlaid, with rugs here and there at the doors and before the sofas and chairs. There was a small, square rug before every chair, and a large one before the sofa. There were a great many other curious things to be observed in the arrangements of the room. The fireplace, for example, was closed by plates of sheet iron, which could be shoved up and down like the sashes of a window; while the windows themselves opened like doors, each having a great brass fastening, like a <b>latch,</b> <b>in</b> the middle, and hinges at the sides.|$|E

40|$|A microelectromechanical-systems-based moving fiber {{variable}} {{optical attenuator}} (VOA) with a Vernier latching mechanism is described in this letter. Controlled misalignment between the end-faces of two optical fibers varies the optical coupling.

The moving fiber is <b>latched</b> <b>in</b> positions using a Vernier latching mechanism with 0. 5 -/spl mu/m step resolution. A prototype VOA has been fabricated using 80 -/spl mu/m silicon-on-insulator. Optical power coupled between the two single-mode fibers varied from 3. 72 to - 44 dBm, and over this range the VOA <b>latched</b> <b>in</b> 30 stable positions.

50|$|<b>Latches</b> <b>in</b> seatbelts {{typically}} {{fasten the}} belt which constrains the occupant {{to the body}} of the car. Particularly in rear seats slightly different latches may be used for each seat in order to prevent adjacent seatbelts from being attached to the wrong point. Inertial seatbelt release is a potential circumstance where, in a collision, the seatbelt latch can unintentionally come loose leading to potential injury of the passenger. An additional risk of seatbelt <b>latches</b> is that <b>in</b> some cases the occupant may believe the latch is secure (e.g., by hearing a characteristic click) when in fact it has not.|$|R
