50|$|The 2014 Saint Jean sur Richelieu ramming {{attack was}} a terror car ramming that {{occurred}} in Quebec on October 20, 2014. Two Canadian Forces members were hit by a <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorist,</b> Martin Couture-Rouleau. Warrant officer Patrice Vincent died from injuries, while another soldier was injured, but survived. The RCMP and the Government of Canada has characterized the homicide as a terrorist act by an ISIL-inspired terrorist.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists</b> {{are highly}} {{likely to be}} afflicted by a mental illness. Studies have {{found that more than}} 40% of <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists</b> have been {{diagnosed}} {{at some point in their}} life with a mental illness. This puts <b>lone</b> <b>wolves</b> as being 13.5 times more likely to suffer from a mental illness than a member of an organized terrorist group, such as al-Qaeda or ISIS.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists</b> are {{frequently}} thought to only be Muslims, however, {{this is not}} always the case. <b>Lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists</b> may sympathize with and consider themselves part of larger groups, but they are not truly a part of them.'''''' Often, the attacks are attributed to people who have a mixture of political and personal grievances. The attackers can have no actual affiliation to the group that claims them, but instead become radicalized online and through external media outlets.|$|R
30|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} {{when it comes to}} detecting possible <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists</b> {{is that there is no}} consistent or typical profile of a <b>lone</b> <b>wolf.</b> Moreover, the <b>lone</b> <b>wolves</b> are hard to capture using traditional intelligence methods since there are no physical groups to infiltrate or wiretap. However, there are many concrete actions and activities (that are not necessarily illegal) taken by an individual that can be treated as weak signals and that combined may indicate an interest in terrorism acts. Recognizing and analyzing digital traces from online activities of possible <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists</b> is one key to the difficult problem of detecting <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists</b> before they strike. We have presented a framework for working with such digital traces through the use of techniques such as topic-filtered web harvesting and content analysis using natural language processing. Parts of the proposed system have been implemented, while work remains to be done for other parts.|$|R
5000|$|A wave of <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorist</b> {{stabbing}} {{attacks in}} which Palestinian Arabs attacked Israelis began on 3 October 2015 {{with the first}} of the Lions' Gate stabbings. [...] The ensuing Israeli-Palestinian conflict (2015-2016) is thought to have been driven not by formal organizations but, rather by social media postings inspiring young Palestinians to undertake attacks with knives and with vehicles. [...] In response, Israeli police have revamped their anti-terrorism tactics, increasing monitoring of social media, improving the intercommunication of mobile devices, and giving security agencies to instantly trace phone calls made such devices.|$|E

5000|$|On December 15, 2014, {{a hostage}} {{crisis in the}} Lindt Café in Martin Place, Sydney ended with three deaths, {{including}} the suspect Man Haron Monis. There is doubt {{as to whether or}} not Monis fit the definition of a <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorist.</b> Queensland University of Technology criminologist Associate Professor Mark Lauchs said it was important the siege wasn't elevated to a [...] "terrorist attack" [...] as such. Associate Professor Lauchs said Monis was simply a deranged person running a hostage situation: [...] "This incident was not about religion and neither was it a terrorist attack, but given that perception by the paraphernalia Monis used." [...] The Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said, [...] "Haron Monis had a long history of violent crime, infatuation with extremism and mental instability. As the siege unfolded yesterday, he sought to cloak his actions with the symbolism of the ISIL death cult."

This was a person with a mental problem who tried to gain attention and succeeded, tried to shut down the city and succeeded, merely by putting up a flag that was something like the flag of ISIS." ...|$|E
30|$|In {{this article}} we present an {{analysis}} method {{that can be used}} to analyze extremist forums to detect digital traces of possible <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists.</b> This method is conceptually demonstrated using the FOI Impactorium fusion platform. We also present a number of different technologies which can be used to harvest and analyze pieces of information from Internet that may serve as weak digital traces that can be fused using the suggested analysis method in order to discover possible <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Lone</b> <b>wolf</b> {{terrorism}} {{remains an}} ambiguous and enigmatic phenomenon. The boundaries of <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> terrorism are fuzzy and arbitrary. This article aims {{to define and}} analyze the main features and patterns of <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> terrorism in fifteen countries. <b>Lone</b> <b>wolf</b> terrorism is shown to be more prevalent in the United States than in the other countries under study. The cross-national analysis suggests that in the United States <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> terrorism has increased markedly {{during the past three}} decades; a similar increase {{does not appear to have}} occurred in the other countries under study. The numbers of casualties resulting from <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> terrorism have been relatively limited, and there is no evidence that the lethality of <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> terrorism is on the increase. The rates of psychological disturbance and social ineptitude are found to be relatively high among <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists.</b> <b>Lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists</b> tend to create their own ideologies that combine personal frustrations and aversion with broader political, social, or religious aims. In this process, many <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists</b> draw on the communities of belief and ideologies of validation generated and transmitted by extremist movements...|$|R
30|$|Even though <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists</b> cannot {{in general}} be {{captured}} by traditional intelligence techniques, this {{does not imply that}} there is nothing counterterrorist organizations can do to prevent them. In fact, despite the popular use of the term “lone wolf terrorist,” many of the perpetrators are only loners in their offline life, but are often very active in communicating their views and radical opinions in various discussion groups or other kinds of social media. According to Sageman [3], most <b>lone</b> <b>wolves</b> are part of online forums, especially those who go on to actually carry out terrorist attacks. This makes the Internet an incredibly important source for finding potential <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Norway in 2011 two {{sequential}} <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorist</b> {{attacks by}} right wing extremist Anders Behring Breivik {{were carried out}} against the government, the civilian population, and a Workers' Youth League (AUF)-run summer camp in Norway on 22 July 2011. The attacks claimed a total of 77 lives. The {{first part of the}} attack was a van bomb in Oslo. The van was placed in front of the office block housing the office of Prime Minister and other government buildings. The explosion killed eight people and injured at least 209 people, twelve of them seriously. He followed this attack by impersonating a police officer to access the island on which the AUF summer camp was being held and proceeded to go on a shooting spree that killed 69 people.|$|E

40|$|Aims and objectives: This study {{explores the}} {{phenomenon}} of <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> terrorism. Theories concerning group-based terrorism {{do not seem to}} be able to explain this type of terrorism. Because of this some researchers have turned to research on mass murder in search for alternative explanations. <b>Lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists</b> and mass murderers seem to have a similar background and share several risk factors. The aim of this study is to examine to what extent these two phenomenon can be seen as similar by comparing the theoretical framework in which the risk factors are placed. Theory and key concepts: The main theories that are being suggested for explaining <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> terrorism and mass murder are theories concerning grievance, what causes it and how it causes violence. These theories are Agnew’s General Strain Theory, as well as Merton’s Theory of Anomie, and Lea and Young’s Theory of Relative Deprivation. Method and data: The empirical material used in this study consists mainly of ten scientific articles examining the profile of <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists.</b> This material have been complemented with secondary literature. The risk factors and the suggested theories have then been compared with the risk factors and suggested theories of mass murder. Results: The results show that not only do <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists</b> and mass murderers share risk factors, the process that leads these two types of perpetrators to violence also seems to be quite similar. The strain model for school shooters, which is presented in this study, also seems to fit <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists.</b> What is surprising, however, is the similarities of the motive. Both tend to create narratives justifying their violent acts, which share similar features...|$|R
30|$|Today, one of {{the most}} {{challenging}} and unpredictable forms of terrorism is violent terror acts committed by single individuals, often referred to as <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists</b> or <b>lone</b> actor terrorists. These kinds of terror attacks are hard to detect and defend against by traditional police means such as infiltration or wiretapping, since the <b>lone</b> <b>wolves</b> are planning and carrying out the attacks on their own. The problem of <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> terrorism is according to many officials presently on the rise and viewed as a greater threat towards society than organized groups. Even though available statistics suggest that <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists</b> account for a rather small proportion of all terror incidents [1], they can often have a large impact on society [2]. Moreover, many of the major terrorist attacks in the United States (with exception for the 2001 attacks against World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and the White House) were executed by single individuals who were sympathetic to a larger cause—from the Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh to the Washington area sniper John Allen Muhammad. A similar development can be seen in Europe, where several terrorist attacks have been executed by <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists</b> during the last years. One of the most terrifying acts was the two 2011 terror attacks in Norway committed by Anders Behring Breivik, killing 77 persons in total.|$|R
30|$|It is {{not unusual}} that <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists</b> are sympathizing with extremist movements, but by {{definition}} they {{are not part of}} or actively supported by these movements. This makes it very hard to discover and capture <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists</b> before they strike, as traditional methods such as wiretapping and infiltration of the organization are not applicable (since there are no networks or organizations to infiltrate). Moreover, it can be very hard to differentiate between those individuals who are really intending to commit an actual terrorism act, and those who have radical beliefs but stay within the law. In fact, there are very many people that have extremism opinions, but only a minority of those cross the line into taking violent action based on such beliefs.|$|R
40|$|This book explores {{new horizons}} for the {{economic}} analysis of terrorism with an innovative combination of economics and offender profiling. The book is aimed at contributing to law enforcement efforts to pre-empt and pursue the <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorist.</b> By taking the economic analysis of terrorism back to its core concepts of 'opportunities' and 'choices' and by insisting that all results be both computable and relevant to the investigative process, the author examines lone wolf terrorism from a unique perspective that yields {{new insights into the}} nature of the lone wolf terrorist's opportunities and choices to inflict human tragedy. Not content with the task of delineating opportunities and choices, the author shows how the frameworks he has developed may be inverted and deployed in the pursuit of the <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorist</b> if efforts to pre-empt the <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorist</b> have failed. This book is groundbreaking for both the type of economics analysis it presents and its conscious break with several long-held traditions of terrorism studies. Both academics and law enforcement practitioners will find the author's analysis stimulating, confronting and, above all, applicable to the investigative processes designed to pre-empt or pursue a single violent offender who aims to etch a graphic biography of violence into the public consciousness. ...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThis thesis will scrutinize {{the histories of}} our nation's three most prolific domestic lone wolf terrorists: Tim McVeigh, Ted Kaczynski, and Eric Rudolph. It will establish a chronological pattern to their radicalization and reveal that their communal ideological beliefs, psychology, attributes, traits, and training take place along a common chronological timeline. Their pattern of radicalization {{can be used as}} an indicator of <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorist</b> radicalization development in future cases. This thesis establishes a strikingly similar chronological pattern of radicalization that was present in each terrorist's biography. This pattern can identify future <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorist</b> radicalization activity upstream. It can provide a valuable portent to apply in the analysis of potential lone terrorists, potentially enabling law enforcement to prevent tragedies emerging from the identified population through psychological assistance, evaluation, training, or, in the worst case, detention.

3000|$|We have in [16] {{identified}} {{a set of}} indicators for someone having the intent to commit an act of terror and becoming a <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorist.</b> The list of indicators is not comprehensive and we use it to illustrate {{how it is possible}} to automatically detect evidence for indicators using text analysis techniques. The indicators that we use are: [...]...|$|E
30|$|To {{conduct a}} {{successful}} terror attack, {{it is necessary}} to have a number of skills and/or capabilities. For a <b>lone</b> <b>wolf,</b> obtaining the necessary capabilities for an attack might be a problem since they can not in general receive the same kind of systematic training such as, e.g., al-Qaeda terrorists. This {{may be one of the}} reasons why <b>lone</b> <b>wolves</b> are rarely suicide bombers, i.e., since such an attack may be too complicated and involves too much preparation [11]. However, the Internet contains much material that potential <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists</b> can use to acquire the knowledge they need to succeed with more simple kinds of attacks. For example, resources such as “the Anarchist Cookbook,” “Training with a handgun,” “Remote Control Detonation,” and “How to make a bomb in the kitchen of your mom” are known to be widespread on the Internet and have been used by <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists</b> for acquiring knowledge on how to build simple pipe bombs, etc.|$|R
5000|$|According to Stratfor, the American global {{intelligence}} firm, [...] "while not {{thus far}} as deadly as suicide bombing", this tactic could prove {{more difficult to}} prevent. No single group has {{claimed responsibility for the}} incidents. Experts see a sort of saving grace in the ignorance and incompetence of most <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists,</b> who often manage to murder very few people.|$|R
30|$|A notable {{characteristic}} of <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists</b> {{is that they}} often announce their views and intentions in advance. In the samples of school shooters (a phenomenon closely related to <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> terrorism) analyzed in [27], {{it can be seen}} that a majority of the perpetrators revealed their intentions in social media before carrying out their attacks. Leakage is the communication to a third party of an intent to do harm to a target. Leakage can be either intentional or unintentional and more or less specific regarding the actual attack [17].|$|R
30|$|The {{analysis}} {{models and}} markers and indicators used {{will need to}} be continuously updated and adapted, both to keep track of changing behavior on the Internet and in order to, for instance, remove markers and models that have wrongly identified someone as a <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorist.</b> It is important that the tools used include ways of doing this, similar to the model adaptation tools that are implemented in the Impactorium tool.|$|E
30|$|Lone wolves {{come from}} a variety of {{backgrounds}} and can have a wide range of motives for their actions. It is observed by [1] that lone wolf terrorists are often creating their own ideologies, combining aversion with religion, society, or politics with a personal frustration. Hence, a <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorist</b> can in theory come in any size, any shape, and any ethnicity, as well as representing any ideology [11].|$|E
40|$|This {{literature}} review examines {{the phenomenon of}} lone wolf terrorism. There seem to be some important {{factors that contribute to}} an individual's deciding to become a <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorist</b> instead of joining a larger terrorist group or network. Although there seems to be consensus about terrorists being psychologically stable, it is likely that some lone wolf terrorists could be diagnosed with various forms of psychopathology. Also, lone wolf terrorism is often preceded by a personal event linked to the upcoming terrorist act - something that has made the political personal. Strong reciprocity and group identification are other factors that could contribute to a person becoming a <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorist.</b> But to what extent these factors differ in lone wolf and group terrorism is unclear. Another important variable is a more general pattern of acting alone, as well as being socially isolated. Research on lone wolves in a variety of other contexts reveals that these individuals are less likely to trust others to do their job properly. This could also be the case in lone wolf terrorism...|$|E
30|$|Once the {{collection}} of relevant data from the Internet is done {{the content of the}} web site and forums needs to be analyzed. In this section we present techniques that can be used by intelligence analysts to analyze data with the aim of discovering indicators supporting that someone has intent to commit an act of terror. The goal of the process described in this section is to obtain a list of potential <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists</b> that need further investigation. Comparing our suggested approach to related work already described in existing research literature (see, e.g., [23 – 25]), two main differences can be identified: 1) our focus on <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists</b> rather than terror organizations, and 2) our focus on semi-automated tools for supporting the analyst, rather than fully automated tools. While it obviously is interesting to construct fully automatic tools for web analysis, it is more realistic to consider a web analysis system that consists of a human user that is supported by tools such as those described in this article. In addition to the problems of making reliable automated tools, there are also cultural and ethical requirements that make it interesting to consider semi-automated tools [5].|$|R
30|$|It is {{important}} to highlight that the proposed system {{is not intended to}} be fully automatic. The central component of the system will be the human analyst, but this analyst will be supported in the work of finding, analyzing, and fusing digital traces of interest for finding potential <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists.</b> In the future, we would like to perform more detailed experiments with the prototype system, to more properly evaluate {{the extent to which it}} is useful for law enforcement officers.|$|R
30|$|<b>Lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists</b> pose a large {{threat to}} modern society. The current ability to {{identify}} and stop these kinds of terrorists before they commit a terror act is limited since they are hard to detect using traditional methods. However, these individuals often make use of Internet to spread their beliefs and opinions, and to obtain information and knowledge to plan an attack. Therefore {{there is a good}} possibility that they leave digital traces in the form of weak signals that can be gathered, fused, and analyzed.|$|R
30|$|These {{behavioral}} markers {{can be used}} {{as indicators}} supporting that someone intends to commit a terror attack. To find relevant digital traces for the behavioral markers, semi-automated analysis is needed since it is impossible for human analysts to manually monitor all the activities of interest on Internet. Such analysis is described in more detail in the section “Techniques for analyzing data.” In the next section, an analysis model {{that can be used to}} analyze digital traces that a possible <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorist</b> might leave on the Internet is presented.|$|E
30|$|Various {{combination}} {{functions such as}} min, max, average, or {{weighted sum}} {{can be used to}} make inferences. Except for combining the various digital traces that have been collected, Impactorium also allows for fusion of information coming from other sources, such as intelligence reports or data from sensors. As an example, if customs provide information that an individual has bought large quantities of fertilizers, this information can be inserted into the threat model calculations. In Figure  3, the likelihood that an actor has intent to become a <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorist</b> has increased since evidence for two (of the five) indicators are found.|$|E
30|$|Since {{the content}} of web sites such as extremist forums is not static, the overall process has to be {{repeated}} over and over again. The first stages can however be done more seldom than the later phases, since forums and web sites of interest will pop up or become obsolete on a much slower rate than the change in content within the web sites. It is also important to note that duration of time is a significant factor in this process. It is very likely that becoming a <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorist</b> is not something that happens over night, but is rather a process that can take several years.|$|E
30|$|Screening for perpetrators, {{from school}} {{shooters}} to <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists,</b> pose a difficult methodological problem for professionals dealing with profiling, whether expert manual profiling or the automatic profiling of individuals through Big Data analysis. The problem {{results from the}} low prevalence of the perpetrators in the population, a problem summarized under the title of “finding {{a needle in a}} haystack”. This problem results in a very high-rate of false positives. These false alarms are usually accompanied by a high price that might dismiss the benefits of the search process [14, 23].|$|R
30|$|There {{are many}} {{examples}} of images and videos posted on the Internet where <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists</b> pose with weapons long before the attack, such as the pictures of Anders Behring Breivik wearing a compression sweater and pointing an automatic weapon against the camera. Other examples of identification can be found among school shooters. One such example is Matthew Murray who killed four people at a church and a missionary training school in Colorado. Murray compared himself to the Columbine shooter Harris and Hui (who {{was responsible for the}} shooting at Virginia Tech University) in an Internet posting.|$|R
5000|$|The USA Freedom Act ( [...] , [...] ) is a U.S. law {{enacted on}} June 2, 2015 that {{restored}} in modified form several {{provisions of the}} Patriot Act, which had expired the day before. The act imposes some new limits on the bulk collection of telecommunication metadata on U.S. citizens by American intelligence agencies, including the National Security Agency. It also restores authorization for roving wiretaps and tracking <b>lone</b> <b>wolf</b> <b>terrorists.</b> The title of the act originally was a ten-letter backronym (USA FREEDOM) that stood for Uniting and Strengthening America by Fulfilling Rights and Ending Eavesdropping, Dragnet-collection and Online Monitoring Act.|$|R
