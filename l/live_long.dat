5|$|Adud al-Dawla, {{like the}} {{previous}} Buyid rulers, maintained the Abbasids in Baghdad, which gave legitimacy to his dynasty {{in the eyes}} of some Sunni Muslims. However, he showed more interest than his predecessors to the pre-Islamic culture of Iran, and was proud of his Iranian origin. He visited Persepolis alongside Marasfand, the Zoroastrian chief priest (mobad) of Kazerun, who read the pre-Islamic inscriptions in the city for him. Adud al-Dawla later left an inscription in the city, which tells about his awareness of being heir of an ancient pre-Islamic civilization. Adud al-Dawla even claimed descent from the Sasanian king Bahram V Gor, minted coins of him wearing a Sasanian type crown, and carried the traditional Sasanian inscription; Shahanshah, may his glory increase.

5|$|After {{defeating}} Baramos in {{a ferocious}} battle {{and returning to}} Aliahan, the Hero's celebration is cut off as Zoma, Baramos's master and the game's true villain, reveals his existence. He attacks and opens a pit to the Dark World, which the Hero jumps into. The Dark World is, in fact, Alefgard (of the previous installments of the series), where the Hero must acquire several of the artifacts that were collected in the original Dragon Quest, including the Sun Stone and the Rain Staff. Rubiss, a legendary sage, has been turned to stone and is rescued by the Hero, and the Hero receives the Sacred Amulet in return. These items, as in the original game, create the Rainbow Bridge which leads the Hero to Zoma's castle for the final confrontation. Along the way, the Hero briefly reunites with Ortega as he is slain by Zoma's monsters, then continues on to defeat the revived Baramos, now turned into the powerful Baramos Bomus and later into the skeletal Baramos Gonus. With the Ball of Light given by the Dragon Queen, the Hero defeats Zoma and frees Alefgard, but Zoma boasts that evil will eventually return {{to the land and}} the Hero will not <b>live</b> <b>long</b> enough to stop it. For their bravery, the Hero receives the title of Loto (Erdrick). The Hero later vanishes from Alefgard, leaving their sword and armor to be passed down throughout the ages so that their descendants can continue to protect the world from evil.|$|E

5|$|The dragon was {{regarded}} as a great lover and seducer of beautiful women, whom he visited by night, entering their houses down the chimney before turning into a man. The women who were visited by a dragon would after a while grow weak, pale and sunken-faced. There were magical methods to repel the dragon from them. It was believed that the children born out of such liaisons were physically and mentally ill, and that they would not <b>live</b> <b>long.</b> In another belief, the dragon would come for his son amidst thunder and lightning, and fly away with him. In the region of Bitola, it was told that such children were born with a tail. After they grew wings, they flew into the sky, from where they shot witches with thunderbolts. There was a belief in the region of Leskovac that the dragon boys, fighters against ale born with the little wings, were offspring of dragons. At the village of Kruševo, Macedonia, people told of an old shepherd named Trail who was a son of a dragon.
