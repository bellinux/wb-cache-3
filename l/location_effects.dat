40|$|This chapter {{explores the}} effects of reading ability upon eye {{movement}} control. In terms of linguistic influences, it presents evidence for initial fixations within words being affected by the informativeness /distinctiveness of sections within those words. It further explores evidence of {{a relationship between the}} initial fixation <b>location</b> <b>effect</b> and reading ability in able readers. Such relationships are investigated by comparing eye movement control with reading disabled subjects and matched control subjects. These data suggest that a number of individuals diagnosed as dyslexic show less influence of informativeness/distinctiveness ahead of fixation, and this is related to lower levels of reading ability within these subjects. In conclusion, the study draws a relationship between reading deficits and the initial fixation <b>location</b> <b>effect.</b> Collected data indicates that the initial fixation <b>location</b> <b>effect</b> can be found within a wide range of different situations and, to some extent, is affected by variables commonly found to influence reading performance. Of the two factors which this study investigates, the initial fixation <b>location</b> <b>effect</b> seems to be more affected by the skill of the reader than the semantic context within which informative beginning/ending words appear...|$|R

40|$|A {{context effect}} occurs when examinees’ item {{responding}} behavior {{is affected by}} the location of an item within a test. Recent advances in testing practice, most notably adaptive testing and certain innovative equating schemes, require items to be more invariant across intended usages than earlier methods. In this paper, <b>location</b> <b>effects</b> are identified as a form of multidimensionality, and examples of testing situations where <b>location</b> <b>effects</b> are important are described. Then, the susceptibility to item <b>location</b> <b>effects</b> of 10 item types from the Graduate Record Examination General Test is investigated by comparing the item difficulty parameters of sets of items across intended usages. Results are replicated using a second form of the test. Two of the 10 item types, analysis of explanations and logical diagrams, are clearly affected by item location in the population tested. One common item type, reading comprehension, appears to be affected somewhat by item context in this population. It is strongly advised that these item types not be used in an adaptive testing program without first assessing their susceptibility to <b>location</b> <b>effects</b> within the population (and subpopulations) of interest...|$|E
40|$|Using a Melitz-style {{model of}} {{heterogeneous}} firms, Baldwin and Okubo (2006) recently presented a theoretical {{model in which}} self-sorting occurs and more productive factories choose to locate in more productive areas. The model suggests that firm-specific factors and regional factors affect {{each other through the}} endogeneity of location decisions. However, to date there have been few studies empirically testing this issue. Against this background, our aim is {{to examine the relationship between}} firms and location-specific factors in location decisions using factory-level panel data from Japan’s Census of Manufactures. We begin by estimating how much of the differences in factories ’ TFP levels can be explained by both firm and <b>location</b> <b>effects.</b> The estimation results show that both effects have a significant impact on the productivity level of a factory, and that the firm effects are more important than the <b>location</b> <b>effects.</b> We also find a statistically significant negative correlation between firm effects and <b>location</b> <b>effects,</b> and investigate what causes this relationship. One potential explanation is that more productive firms may tend to set up new factories in less productive locations suc...|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of <b>location</b> <b>effect</b> on prices is recognized by real estate literature. This paper proposes a spatial analysis of prices, {{but also of}} asset liquidity. In particular we introduce {{a new approach to}} measure the relative improvement in price and asset liquidity prediction when the location is known, as opposed to when the location is unknown. As a first application we considered a simplified model, where the location is represented through geographical submarkets. We applied the model to an Italian case study, where real estate markets are divided into geographical submarkets according to the law. We investigated <b>location</b> <b>effect</b> on selling price and asking price, that in Italy is often used for appraisal purposes. We find empirical evidence of the Italian submarket impact on house prices. By contrast, we show that the liquidity of the market, proxied by the time on the market and the discount ratio, is not associated with geographical submarkets...|$|R

We find that in most cases the attrition dummy is either not significant or becomes so once <b>location</b> <b>effects</b> are included as controls. Out of about ten outcomes of interest, we find only two for which some differences remain even after controlling for the <b>location</b> <b>effects,</b> at 5 and 10 % levels, respectively. In general, these results indicate no systematic bias between controls who were re-interviewed and those who were not.|$|E
40|$|Most {{procedures}} {{that have been}} proposed to identify dispersion effects in unreplicated factorial designs assume that <b>location</b> <b>effects</b> have been identified correctly. Incorrect identi- fication of <b>location</b> <b>effects</b> may impair subsequent identification of dispersion effects. We develop a model for joint identification of location and dispersion effects that can reliably identify active effects of both types. The joint model is estimated using maximum likelihood, and hence effect selection is done using a specially derived information criterion. An exhaustive search through a limited version of the space of possible models is conducted. Both a single-model output and model averaging are considered. The method is shown {{to be capable of}} identifying sensible location-dispersion models that are missed by methods that rely on sequential estimation of location and dispersion effects...|$|E

40|$|Unreplicated {{fractional}} factorial {{designs are}} usually {{used to identify}} <b>location</b> <b>effects</b> and dispersion effects in screening experiments. Various methods for identifying active <b>location</b> <b>effects</b> have been proposed during last three decades. All of these methods depend on the assumption of no dispersion effects. Meanwhile most of the dispersion-identification methods rely on first identifying the correct location effect model. The presence of dispersion effects induces correlation among location effect estimates. If location-effect identification methods are sensitive to this correlation, then finding the correct location model may be more difficult {{in the presence of}} dispersion effects. The primary aim of this project is to compare the robustness of different location-identification methods - Box and Meyer (1986), Lenth (1989), Berk and Picard (1991), and Loughin and Noble (1997) - under the heteroscedastic model via simulation studies.

40|$|The use of mixed-effects {{models in}} practice, {{often in the}} form of Bayesian {{hierarchical}} models, is growing rapidly because of major developments in computational methods for these models. Mixed-effects models with measurements of a response on a continuous measurement scale typically specify the random effects as <b>location</b> <b>effects.</b> Data sets with random <b>location</b> <b>effects</b> can also have random scale effects. When scale effects are present, it is essential to model them to insure valid inferences. But typically, in practice, the random <b>location</b> <b>effects</b> and errors are taken to be normal and the random scale effects are taken to be the square root of an inverse gamma. However, these assumptions are usually driven by convenience and not reality. ^ Little previous work has been done in model building for mixed-effects models with random scale effects because adding a random scale effect into the usual mixed-effects model will lead to a great challenge. But assessing the plausibility of a posited model is always fundamental, especially in Bayesian data analysis. A Bayesian analysis, which conditions on the whole probability model, can be very misleading when the model is far from plausible. ^ This dissertation introduces a stepwise model building approach for the mixed-effects models with random scale effects. The stepwise model building approach is able to check and identify the distribution for each model component step by step. New data visualization tools, immensely powerful for model building, have been developed. In field null-power simulations are performed to ensure the effectiveness of the visualization tools. ...|$|E

An overall home advantage was found for the sample in relation to home-winning and home-goal percentage. For technical performance the team exhibited more successful behaviours, such as tackles, passes and aerial challenges, at home than away. For tactics-related behaviours, more aerial challenges, corner kicks, crosses, passes, dribbles and shots on goal were performed at home in the attacking third of the pitch. In addition, more goal kicks, interceptions, aerial challenges and clearances were performed in the defensive third when playing away.

These varieties were sown in RCBD with three replications during 2012 / 13 at Haro Sabu Research Center on station and kombo Sub-Site, Ethiopia. Combined analyses of data from the two experimental sites(Haro Sabu Research Center on station and kombo Sub-Site location) revealed very highly significant varietal differences (P < 0. 05) in grain yield, and days to 50 % flower, days to 95 % maturity and highly significant for stand count and significant for plant height and hundred seed weight. However, no significant varietal differences observed in branch per plant and seed per pod. The <b>location</b> <b>effect</b> was very highly significant (P < 0. 05) for days to 50 % flower, days to 95 % maturity, and highly significant (P < 0. 05) for grain yield and plant height.
