After {{experiments}} through {{the early months of}} 1917 that proved successful, the first formal convoys were organized in late May.

The convoy loss rate dropped to 1% in October. However, convoy was not mandatory, and monthly loss rates did not fall below their 1916 levels until August 1918.|$|R
