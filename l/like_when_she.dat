She has been taught on how to sing traditional songs by her own mother who herself is a folk singer. She has been promoting this genre of music on almost each and every major concert of her <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> did at her concert at the Royal Albert Hall, medleys of Malay folk songs and traditional music songs.|$|E

Considering where Meredith was at the beginning and where she is now, I think she went through a remarkable journey and did more than just growing up, she finally became “all whole and healed“." ...|$|E
500|$|Angelou's fourth {{autobiography}} The Heart of a Woman {{opened with}} Angelou {{and her son}} Guy living in an experimental commune with whites, {{in an attempt to}} participate in the new openness between Blacks and whites. She was not completely comfortable with the arrangement, however; as Lupton pointed out, Angelou never named her roommates. For the most part, Angelou was able to freely interact with whites in this book, but she occasionally encountered prejudice similar to earlier episodes, <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> required the assistance of white friends to rent a home in a segregated neighborhood. Lupton stated that compared to her other books, Angelou had come [...] "a long way" [...] from her interactions with whites and people of other races. [...] Hagen called the descriptions of whites and the hopes for eventual equality in this book [...] "optimistic". [...] Angelou continued, however, her indictment of white power structure and her protests against racial injustice that had been a theme throughout all her books. Instead of offering solutions, however, she simply reported on, reacted to, and dramatized events.|$|E

6000|$|Rosy paused with {{a sudden}} choke; but too proud to break down, she only wiped two drops off her cheek with the long ends of her little gray silk glove, set her lips, and {{remained}} mistress of herself, privately planning to cry all <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> was safely in the [...] "nice little room" [...] promised her.|$|R
500|$|In 2009, {{the serial}} {{embarked}} on two lesbian storylines, {{one of which}} involved Nicole. It featured Freya Duric (Sophie Hensser) kissing Nicole, which sparked complaints. However, for Nicole it wasn't about sexuality, rather finding herself the center of attention. James described their dynamic, stating: [...] "Freya's exactly what Nicole was <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> first arrived in the bay, {{that is why they}} click. Nicole relates to the wild side of Freya, but has no idea how far Freya is going to take it." [...] Through her relationship with Geoff she had mellowed, however her vanity was still present. James said Nicole was [...] "angry" [...] because she was on Freya's [...] "not hot list". Freya kissed her to prove she thinks she is hot, James opined that Nicole did not enjoy the kiss, but was just [...] "happy to be center of attention" [...] and happy that people were talking about her again. The incident eventually brought her to the realisation that she had become boring. Nicole denied it was to do with her involvement with Geoff, however James said Geoff was the reason she became bored.|$|E
500|$|I'm Going to Tell You a Secret {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. O'Brien noted how the film revealed a [...] "strange isolation {{at the cost}} of stardom" [...] from Madonna. She complimented the scenes featuring her father, and the scenes where Madonna was not self-conscious, <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> interacts with her children, talks about her [...] "fat Italian thighs" [...] and also the performance in rain at Dublin. O'Brien criticized other portions of the film, which she said was [...] "affected" [...] by conscious behavior in front of the camera, like backstage parties, poem and piano recitals. Author J. Randy Taraborrelli wrote in his book [...] that the film allowed a much closer look at the singer's family. He was particularly impressed by the scenes featuring Lourdes, believing that she [...] "revealed herself to be sophisticated beyond her years". Kathryn Flett from The Observer newspaper described it as [...] "Fascinating, [...] tiny flashes of insight into her relationship with , which occasionally involve her being just as girlie and ever so slightly insecure as the rest of us." [...] Rupert Smith from The Guardian reported that the director [...] "squeezed every last drop of spectacle from a highly stage-managed performance", but commented that [...] "she gave away far more in 1991's In Bed with Madonna; this time she gave only the illusion of candour". However, he complimented saying [...] "Even the easy-to-mock pre-show prayers brought a tear to the eye. We don't need to be told that 'there's more to life than fame and fortune– something deeper, more profound', or that 'the material world' is a bad thing. But it's good to see an entertainer who, 20 years into her career, is still trying to change the world".|$|E
2500|$|Producer Melissa Cobb {{said that}} {{originally}} Po was [...] "more of a jerk," [...] {{but that the}} character changed after they heard Jack Black. According to Jack Black, he mostly worked [...] "in isolation", although he and Dustin Hoffman did spend a day together, which Cobb said helped with the scene where their characters face off. Lucy Liu said that the film [...] "was quite different because {{it was such a}} long process." [...] Liu said that when she was presented with the project they already had artwork of her character as well as a [...] "short computerized video version of what she would look <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> moved." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{testifying before}} the Senate, Bentley was {{protected}} from libel suits. When she repeated her charge that Remington was a Communist on NBC Radio's Meet the Press, he sued her and NBC for libel. At this point, Remington's case acquired considerable notoriety. When Remington's lawyers attempted to subpoena Bentley, she initially {{could not be}} found, prompting headlines of [...] "RED WITNESS [...] "MISSING" [...] AT 100-G SLANDER SUIT" [...] and the <b>like.</b> <b>When</b> <b>she</b> finally reappeared, she was subpoenaed for the libel suit. She refused to testify at Remington's loyalty hearing. The Loyalty Review Board noted that the only serious evidence against Remington was [...] "the uncorroborated statement {{of a woman who}} refuses to submit herself to cross-examination," [...] and cleared Remington to return to his government post. The libel suit was settled out of court shortly thereafter, with NBC paying Remington $10,000.|$|E
60|$|Thus mused Godfrey, {{trying to}} picture to himself what Isobel looked <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> had stood {{by his side}} on that long-past autumn eve, and only succeeded in remembering exactly what she looked <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> was kissing a rose with a certain knight in armour in a square garden, since for some perverse reason it was this picture that {{remained}} so painfully clear to his mind. Then he drifted off into speculations upon the general mystery of things of a sort that were common with him, and in these became oblivious of all else.|$|E
60|$|She {{reflected}} {{that she had}} done all {{that it was necessary}} to do in practical matters. She had written a great many letters, and had obtained Willoughby's consent. She had dwelt so often upon Mr. Hewet's prospects, his profession, his birth, appearance, and temperament, that she had almost forgotten what he was really <b>like.</b> <b>When</b> <b>she</b> refreshed herself by a look at him, she used to wonder again what he was like, and then, concluding that they were happy at any rate, thought no more about it.|$|E

5000|$|One of the series' running gags is the odd {{similarities}} between the women who {{get in the way}} of Ichitaka being with Iori. Not only do they all have I names (or AI in the case of Aiko Asou), but they all appear very similar in appearance. Izumi looks <b>like</b> Iori <b>when</b> <b>she</b> has long hair and <b>like</b> Itsuki <b>when</b> <b>she</b> has cut it short. Aiko also looks like Iori but this time more of a near perfect double with the exception of a mole on her cheek.|$|R
60|$|I suppose, madam, {{that you}} must {{sometimes}} have noticed {{one of the top}} candles of a chandelier, when the room gets hot, suddenly bending over and drooping and shedding tears of hot paraffine on the candles below, and perhaps on the table; and if you can remember what that overcome candle looked like, you will have an idea of what Miss Pondar looked <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> found out Lord Edward was a dog. I think that for one brief moment she hugged to her bosom the fond belief that I was intimate with the aristocracy, and that a noble lord, had he not departed this life, would have been the first to welcome me home, and that she--she herself--was in my service. But the drop was an awful one. I could see the throes of mortified disappointment in her back, as she leaned over a bed of pinks, pulling out young plants, I am afraid, as well as weeds. When I looked at her, I was sorry I let her know it was a dog I mourned. She has tried so hard to make everything all right while we have been here, that she might just as well have gone on thinking that it was a noble earl who died.|$|E
6000|$|At about half-past nine Miss Allan {{came very}} {{slowly into the}} hall, and walked very slowly to the table where the morning papers were laid, {{but she did not}} put out her hand to take one; she stood still, thinking, with her head a little sunk upon her shoulders. She looked curiously old, and from the way in which she stood, a little hunched {{together}} and very massive, you could see what she would be <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> was really old, how she would sit day after day in her chair looking placidly in front of her. Other people began to come into the room, and to pass her, but she did not speak to any of them or even look at them, and at last, as if it were necessary to do something, she sat down in a chair, and looked quietly and fixedly in front of her. She felt very old this morning, and useless too, as if her life had been a failure, {{as if it had been}} hard and laborious to no purpose. She did not want to go on living, and yet she knew that she would. She was so strong that she would live to be a very old woman. She would probably live to be eighty, and as she was now fifty, that left thirty years more for her to live. She turned her hands over and over in her lap and looked at them curiously; her old hands, that had done so much work for her. There did not seem to be much point in it all; one went on, of course one went on. [...] . She looked up to see Mrs. Thornbury standing beside her, with lines drawn upon her forehead, and her lips parted as if she were about to ask a question.|$|E
