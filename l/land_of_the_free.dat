500|$|The Iron Sheik and Nikolai Volkoff (with Slick) were {{in action}} next, against The Killer Bees ("Jumping" [...] Jim Brunzell and B. Brian Blair). Slick asked {{all of the}} fans to rise to respect Nikolai Volkoff's singing of the Soviet National Anthem, and when Volkoff began singing, [...] "Hacksaw" [...] Jim Duggan came to the ring with his two-by-four, which had a tiny American flag {{attached}} to it, got on the microphone and said that Volkoff {{was not going to}} sing because America is the <b>land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>free</b> and the home of the brave. While the match ensued, Duggan stayed at ringside. When The Iron Sheik locked a camel clutch on Brunzell, Duggan, who was chasing Volkoff around the ring and finally into it, stopped and hit an unsuspecting Sheik across the back with his 2x4 in front of the referee, resulting in The Iron Sheik and Nikolai Volkoff winning the bout by disqualification.|$|E

2500|$|The flag {{has become}} a {{powerful}} symbol of Americanism, and is flown on many occasions, with giant outdoor flags used by retail outlets to draw customers. Desecration of the flag is considered a public outrage, but remains protected as freedom of speech. Scholars have noted the irony that [...] "he flag is so revered because it represents the <b>land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>free,</b> and that freedom includes {{the ability to use}} or abuse that flag in protest". In worldwide comparison, Testi noted in 2010 that the United States was not unique in adoring its banner, for the flags of Scandinavian countries are also [...] "beloved, domesticated, commercialized and sacralized objects".|$|E
2500|$|... "This sounds simple: do we {{not already}} sing our love for and {{obligation}} to the <b>land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>free</b> {{and the home of}} the brave? Yes, but just what and whom do we love? Certainly not the soil, which we are sending helter-skelter down river. Certainly not the waters, which we assume have no function except to turn turbines, float barges, and carry off sewage. Certainly not the plants, of which we exterminate whole communities without batting an eye. Certainly not the animals, of which we have already extirpated many {{of the largest and most}} beautiful species. A land ethic of course cannot prevent the alteration, management, and use of these ‘resources,’ but it does affirm their right to continued existence, and, at least in spots, their continued existence in a natural state. In short, a land ethic changes the role of Homo sapiens from conqueror of the land-community to plain member and citizen of it. It implies respect for his fellow-members, and also respect for the community as such." ...|$|E

The US system takes a long time to gather speed. Once it does, it can be hard to stop." [...] In a review for CounterPunch, Charles R. Larson wrote: [...] "What is so compelling about The Case for Impeachment is the plethora of acts by Donald Trump that in a sane world would have brought him down long before he even ran for president." [...] Larson recommended the book to potential readers: [...] "you need to read The Case for Impeachment, a brilliant analysis of every fraudulent act committed by the child in the White House". Brent Budowsky reviewed the book for The Hill and praised it, writing: [...] "Lichtman has written what may be the most important book of the year." [...] He agreed with the premise that the book should start a wider debate in the public: [...] "I am suggesting that Professor Lichtman is right: America should now begin a serious debate about how far is too for the leader of the <b>land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>free</b> and the home of the brave." ...|$|E

In January 1998, they were charged with mischief, breaking and entering, trespassing, and theft. They both left good impressions on the juvenile officers, who offered to expunge their criminal records if they agreed to attend a diversionary program to include community service, received psychiatric treatment, and obeyed the law. Harris was required to attend anger management classes where, again, he made a favorable impression. They were so well-behaved that their probation officer discharged them from the program a few months earlier than the due date. Of Harris, it was remarked that he was [...] "a very bright individual who is likely to succeed in life", while Klebold was said to be intelligent, but [...] "needs to understand that hard work is part of fulfilling a dream." [...] On April 30, Harris handed over the first version of a letter of apology he wrote to the owner of the van, which he completed the next month. In the letter, Harris expressed regret about his actions; however, in one of his journal entries dated April 12, he wrote: [...] "Isnt america supposed to be the <b>land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>free?</b> how come, If im free, I cant deprive some fucking dumbshit from his possessions If he leaves them sitting {{in the front seat of}} his fucking van in plain sight in the middle of fucking nowhere on a fri-fucking-day night?

60|$|It is {{a commonplace}} {{that men are}} all agreed in using symbols, and all differ {{about the meaning of}} the symbols.

Doubtless, he might find many other things to surprise him in the <b>land</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>free,</b> and many calculated to make him think that the bird, if not imperial, was at least rather imperious. But I am not discussing those exceptional details here. It is equally obvious that a Russian reactionary might cross the world with a vow of vengeance against the red flag. But that authoritarian might have some difficulties with the authorities, if he shot a man for using the red flag on the railway between Willesden and Clapham Junction.|$|E
