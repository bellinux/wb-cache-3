50|$|<b>Latensification</b> is {{the name}} given to uniformly pre-exposing a {{photographic}} emulsion (film).|$|E
50|$|The {{benefits}} of <b>latensification</b> are applicable in astrophotography - capturing images of stars. Without <b>latensification</b> an image {{would come out}} with several visible stars and be a perfectly acceptable image. However, {{many areas of the}} image would contain 'sub-latent' images, or areas of emulsion which have not received sufficient light to be exposed enough to show up. If the film was pre-exposed, the threshold point of exposure could be reduced, so these 'sub-latent' images could become visible. More simply, the stars which would normally be too dark to expose the film would now be sufficiently bright to expose correctly.|$|E
50|$|Preflashing is not {{strictly}} a hypersensitizing technique {{but it was}} often {{used in conjunction with}} Kodak's spectroscopic emulsions, sometimes together with hypering. It involves a brief, uniform, low-intensity flash of light sufficient to produce a small increase in the unexposed fog level. This was usually done just before a long exposure and gave modest increases in effective speed. <b>Latensification</b> works similarly but is applied after the exposure.|$|E
50|$|A similar problem {{exists in}} holography. The total energy {{required}} when exposing holographic film using a {{continuous wave laser}} (i.e. for several seconds) is significantly less than the total energy required when exposing holographic film using a pulsed laser (i.e. around 20 - 40 nanoseconds) due to a reciprocity failure. It can also be caused by very long or very short exposures with a continuous wave laser. To try to offset the reduced brightness of the film due to reciprocity failure, a method called <b>latensification</b> can be used. This is usually done directly after the holographic exposure and using an incoherent light source (such as a 25-40 W light bulb). Exposing the holographic film to the light {{for a few seconds}} can increase the brightness of the hologram by an order of magnitude.|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} made into {{the effect of the}} {{secondary}} 2 ̆ 2 low Intensity” <b>latensification</b> on Super Panchro Press, Type 8 film. The response variables tested for were speed, D-Max, gamma, and fog. Tests were conducted to appraise the effect of Daylight and Tungsten illumination for Exposure and <b>Latensification</b> and their interaction. The experiment revealed that a significant speed increase is possible; gamma is affected by <b>Latensification</b> time and illumination; D-Max is affected by illumination; and that the degree of <b>latensification</b> is dependent upon the time of secondary exposure. It was found that a significant <b>latensification</b> effect can be achieved with a small fog level increase...|$|E
40|$|Under the {{conditions}} of a low-altitude, rapid access photographic system, a method of simultaneously intensifying image exposures is compared to low intensity <b>latensification.</b> The simultaneous intensification resulted in a speed increase of 2. 4 times, while <b>latensification</b> produced a speed increase of 1. 7 times. <b>Latensification</b> was more effective {{in most of the}} other responses that were analyzed: reduction of Contrast Index was less by 0. 1; speed at the minimum gradient point defined by the untreated strips was increased by <b>latensification</b> by 1. 29 times compared to 1. 23 times by simultaneous intensification. The detective quantum efficiency of the latensified film was higher than that produced by simultaneous intensification except for the extreme toe region where simultaneous intensification did increase information content. The maximum DQE found for the untreated film was maintained by latensification; the simultaneously intensified film showed a reduction of maximum DQE by 0. 66. Because <b>latensification</b> permitted density increases with less loss of contrast, it was found to be the more effective treatment in terms of information, except in the extreme toe, leading to certain compromises. Simultaneous intensification may be suitable only for specialized applications in which use of an exposure in the extreme toe is required over optimum pictorial exposures...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} was conducted regarding {{the effects of}} varying supplementary exposure on High eSpeed Infrared Film. In addition, CPA was evaluated in comparison to Hypersensitization and <b>Latensification.</b> The results were that CPA is superadditive with respect to both density and exposure, the maximum effect being noted in the toe of the characteristic curve. Furthermore, Hypersensitization and <b>Latensification,</b> with dark intervals up to five seconds, displayed efficiency that was {{not significantly different from}} CPA. It was also determined that the spectral distribution of the imaging source does not affect the efficiency of CPA. Corroboration of C 2 ̆ 6 C Research 2 ̆ 7 s speed increase claims was achieved...|$|E
40|$|This thesis uses an unsensitized {{emulsion}} and two chemically sensitized emulsions {{to investigate}} the effect of oxygen and water vapor on latent-image formation and stability. At exposure times that cause little or no low-intensity reciprocity failure, vacuum treatment of an emulsion can result in photographic speeds significantly lower than those found in a humidified environment. This is presumably due to competition between internal desensitization sites and surface electron traps for conduction-band electrons. Storage of a latent image in a humidified air environment will induce a speed loss in some emulsions. The unsensitized emulsion was most sensitive to environmental factors while the sulfurplus- gold-sensitized emulsion was not. This is presumably due to the composition {{and size of the}} latent image. Maximum changes in photographic speed over time require the presence of both oxygen and water vapor. Oxygen alone may cause latent-image decay in some emulsions. Water vapor in a nitrogen environment did not affect latent-image stability. Extended development and gold <b>latensification</b> restored some of the speed loss observed with the unsensitized emulsion. The unrecovered speed loss is due to either latent-image centers being completely oxidized, or being too small to respond to chemical <b>latensification...</b>|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThe chief {{problem of}} this {{research}} was to study by standard sensitometric procedures the effects of intensity, time and wavelength on the amount of speed increase which might be obtained from four representative slow, regular, high, and extra high speed emulsions (Royal Pan, Aerial Recon type 1 -B Class L, Plus X and Microfile) by <b>latensification.</b> <b>Latensification</b> has been defined simply as a process applied after exposure and before development to increase the speed or sensitivity (reciprocal of the exposure required to produce a given result) of an emulsion. A secondary purpose was to examine <b>latensification</b> of a very slow, fine grain emulsion for possible use in small high quality aerial camera systems, in which the emulsion graininess is the limiting factor when used with conventional high speed emulsions. The <b>latensification</b> method in this case was post-exposure to radiation from 0. 36 to 0. 68 microns. This spectral range was divided into four bands by the Wratten Filters # 25 A, 58 and 47 B, (red, green and blue respectively) and the Corning 7 - 54, ultraviolet. White light was also used. A tungsten lamp of constant intensity, combined with a ground glass and two inch opal glass disk diffuser produced a source of uniform illumination. Normally exposed sensitometric strips were then subject to laten sification by exposure to radiation in which the spectral region, intensity, and time were varied. Each emulsion was subject to four spectral regions plus white light and four intensity levels for each region. The exposure was then extended over a range of time believed sufficient to reach a peak speed increase for that intensity. Reciprocity failure was sufficient to need considerable attention. The characteristic curves were analyzed by measuring ASA, halfgamma and inertia (H & D) speeds. The speed ratios (latensified speed/control speed) obtained for each spectral region, intensity, and time of exposure were compiled. Curves of speed ratio against time of exposure and fog level against required exposure time for each intensity and spectral region were plotted. These experiments have shown that white light may be used most efficiently in <b>latensification</b> with the panchromatic emulsions tested. In addition to this {{it has been shown that}} the short wavelength region is less effective in producing speed gains than is the long wavelength region. It has been explained that these effects may be due primarily to the greater scattering of the blue and ultra-violet light by the emulsion even though the Gurney-Mott theory of latent image formation would indicate otherwise if these other influences were n ot considered. The overall evaluation attests to the fact that the effect of wavelength is a secondary consideration as compared to the intensity of radiation used to latensify the emulsion. Optimum intensity, when applied with the proper length of exposure time to produce a fog lievel approximately double the normal fog, is the major factor leading to optimum conditions of speed gain. The maximum speed ratio gains achieved for each emulsion were Royal Pan 2. 24, Aerial Recon 1. 85, Plus X 2. 08, and Microfile 7. 35. Generally speaking the slower the emulsion the better the gains which may be achieved. Royal Pan, however, was an exception and produced unexpected results in speed gain. The results obtained with Microfile indicate this fine grain emulsion may possibly be employed in miniature camera systems for use in aerial photography. A less active developer than normally used D- 11 must be used to reduce contrast to a comparable degree ordinarily used in aerial photography. The effect of forced development in D- 11 was found not to produce speed gains as high as the less active development in D- 23, Development in Microdol (1 : 4) proved of little interest as speed loss was excessive. This speed loss is characteristic of most true fine-grain developers...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{evidence}} indicates that a high intensity, short duration exposure produces surface image exclusively in this emulsion. The ensuing fading was shown not {{to be caused by}} internal migration of the latent image. The high intensity exposure produced a massive amount of sub image nuclei which could subsequently be rendered developable by a low intensity post exposure. This <b>latensification</b> failed to achieve an improvement in image stability, in that the amount of fading was shown to be solely a function of the density of the fresh exposure. It was hypothesized that although this treatment did raise some grains from an unstable state of developability to stable one, a proportonate amount of grains were brought from undevelopability to one of developable instability. Washing the film in either distilled water or a solution of 5 x 10 ^- 4 N KBr was effective in stabilizing the image against fading...|$|E
40|$|A uniform {{secondary}} {{exposure of}} low intensity {{is made to}} a normal or underexposed primary latent image for approximately 5 - 15 minutes, to increase the effective speed index. This is first studied from a white light approach {{similar to that used}} in single emulsion negative materials. In addition, the ability to manipulate and align individual layers by selective filtering was also studied. Red, green and blue filters, matched closely to the spectral sensitivity of each layer, were used separately and conjunctively towards achievement of the desired levels of effective speed, contrast, color balance and maximum density. <b>Latensification</b> by a secondary white light exposure increases the effective A. S. A. speed of specific layers by as much as 2 1 / 2 f/stops. Through selective filtering, an ability to increase speed and align two or more layers has been demonstrated. The effective overall speed of Ektachrome-X film has been increased by a factor of ~ (2) but at the expense of losses in Dmax.; contrast; and color balance...|$|E
40|$|Scintillation {{studies on}} the uptake of 63 Ni 2 + by Pseudomonas tabaci {{demonstrate}} an incorporation of approximately 2 - 5 nmol per 10 ' ° bacterial cells, in medium containing 12 nmol (8 - 3 /iCi) per ml. Over 80 % of the incorporated Ni 2 + is lost from the cells during washing, fixation and dehydration with ethanol. The remaining insoluble (bound) 63 Ni 2 + has the highest level in cells fixed in acetic acid/ethanol (0 - 4 nmol/ 1010 cells), with smaller amounts in paraformaldehyde- and glutaraldehyde-fixed cells. The radioactive level in aldehyde-fixed cells represents a total Ni 2 + uptake of about lCTl 8 g or 104 atoms per cell. Light- and electron-microscope autoradiography corroborated the scintillation studies in demon-strating a higher retention of label by cells fixed in acetic acid/ethanol, possibly reflecting a higher retention of medium M, proteins {{with this type of}} fixation. High-resolution electron-microscope autoradiography involving gold <b>latensification</b> with physical development demonstrated a clear localization of silver grains to the central nucleoid region (seen most clearly over the discrete nucleoid of aldehyde-fixed cells) and within this to the chromatin (seen most clearly over the condensed chromatin of acetic acid/ethanol-fixed cells). It is suggested that the incorporated 63 Ni 2 + labels mainly central, genetically inactive DNA, while peripheral, actively transcribing DNA has little associated radioactivity. The pattern of cation association seen in this bacterium shows a number of close similarities to the situation seen in dinoflagellate cells...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThe general {{problem of}} this work is to {{determine}} the extent to which fine grain emulsions can be employed in aerial photography, with specific application to miniaturization. In such a study, the following factors become important: reduced scale, limited coverage, processing and enlargement technique, loss of speed through the use of finer grained emulsions. In this investigation, laboratory tests were made to study these factors. These tests were to study the relative performance of several systems (lens plus film) and to investigate methods of increasing the speed of fine grain emulsions without seriously affecting the grain size. Finally, flight tests were made to verify the results indicated by the laboratory tests. Miniaturization is defined as the use of 35 mm and 70 mm cameras in aerial photography. It has become important during the last few years because of increasing space limitations inside the aircraft. Besides the obvious saving in weight and space both in the plane and in the processing and storage of the photographs, the miniature camera has other advantages. Because of the short focal length of most miniature camera lenses, it is possible to construct a fast lens of high quality, reducing the exposure time, the time in which vibration and image motion can affect the image, and hence the degree of stabilization which the camera must maintain. On the negative side, the reduced scale necessitates the enlargement of all photographs before they can be used. This increases the relative effects of the grain of the emulsion and uneven development, as well as introducing an additional variable in the photographic process, enlargement. The camera used in this work was an Exacta VX, 35 mm, with an f/ 1. 5 75 mm Biotar lens. This lens was chosen largely because of its wide aperture, but this could not be used under practical conditions because of serious vignetting at f/ 1. 5. The film chosen for a standard of comparison was Aerographic Super XX with a standard development in D- 19 to a gamma of 1. 6 to 1. 7. At the other extreme, with respect to speed and grain size, Microfile was chosen. This film is easily developed to gammas of 3 and 4, but for the purpose {{of this work}}, it was developed in D- 23, diluted 1 : 1, to a gamma similar to Aero XX. As a compromise in speedand grain size, a German film, Perutz Pergrano, was chosen. This film has an ASA exposure index of 12 and medium grain. DevHopment was in D- 19 to a gamma of 1. 35. Because of the inherent low contrast of this film, the gammas of Aero XX and Microfile could not be attained. Extensive tests were run on the f/ 1. 5 75 mm Biotar lens with all three types of film, low and high contrast resolution tar gets, and with and without a yellow filter. From the results of these tests, the area weighted average resolution, or AWAR, was calculated for each aperture-film combination. Then, under the conditions which would be used for the flight tests, the minimum shutter speed was calculated which would prevent the resolution from dropping below the AWAR because of image motion caused by the movement of the airplane with respect to the ground. Next a table was prepared showing the predicted maximum resolution obtained under varying illumination conditions, taking into account the effect on resolution of increasing the aperture or the exposure time. The results of this table, which were confirmed by the flight tests, were: 1) Microfile must be exposed at too wide an aperture to obtain any benefit from its small grain size, 2) Microfile which has been latensified by post-exposure to light (see below) produces the best results under good illumination, but also must be exposed at too wide an aperture under decreased illumination, and 3) Perutz Pergrano produces better results than Aero XX over a range of illumination of 32 : 1. Results of resolution tests on 2 tele-photo lenses were used to compare these lenses with the 75 mm Biotar. The best lens was the f/ 5. 5 180 mm Tele-Xenar lens, which had a performance, in terms of ground detail resolved, equal to the Biotar lens. This result was verified by flight tests with the two lenses, and hence the use of tele-photo lenses is warranted in high altitude photography, where the decreased coverage can be overlooked. From previously unpublished data on four 50 mm lenses and one 58 mm lens, the AWAR was calculated and the results plotted and analyzed. The best of the 50 mm lenses was an f/ 1. 5 Angenieux. When the f/ 2 58 mm Zeiss Biotar lens and the Angenieux lens were reduced to a common level by removing the scale, the two lenses were of approximately the same performance. Of the methods of increasing film speed before exposure (hypersensitization) and after exposure but before development (<b>latensification),</b> the best method tested was post-exposure to a dim light. For this purpose, a darkroom safelight with a yellow filter and reduced applied voltage was exposed to Microfile for 30 minutes at a distance of 18 feet. An increase in speed of 400 % was obtained over its normal speed of 1 (because of underdevelopment). Equal treatment before exposure gave an increase of speed of only 15 %. When the method was used under actual photographic conditions, post-exposure to light gave a somewhat greater increase in speed than 400 %. Resolution tests showed a drop in resolution of 10 %, but the resolving power was still greater than that of Perutz Pergrano. Other methods of hypersensitization and <b>latensification</b> which were tested were NaCl and Borax in solution, Mercury vapor, and combinations of ammonia and alcohol in solution. The maximum increase obtained from these methods was 50 %. The increase in speed obtained on Microfile through post-exposure to light has brought the emulsion sensitivity to a minimum level for best results under normal illumination. Hence the grain size is also approximately at a minimum and this film, used in this way, provides maximum definition in terms of detail resolved. Then on the basis of X 8 enlargements of 35 mm negatives on Microfile which had been latensified in this manner, the conclusion is reached that 35 mm cameras may not be used as an unqualified substitute for aerial cameras. However they may prove valuable in some types of reconnaissance photography. The enlargement to 4 diameters of negatives on Microfile latensified and Perutz Pergrano produces good results. Since this is the amount of enlargement necessary to bring 70 mm negatives to approximately the size of a 9 X 9 inch photograph, 70 mm cameras may be used in connection with these films and others of similar characteristics to replace aerial cameras for many purposes. The major exceptions are in the production of photographs for use in surveying and photogammetric work, which require maximum definition at all levels of magnification. Aero XX is not recommended for use with miniature cameras in general because the lenses of these cameras are capable of higher resolution than this film can accomodate. At a drop in emulsion speled of 8 I from Aero XX, Perutz Pergrano may be used over an illumination range of 32 : 1, and still produce better results than would be obtained with Aero XX. This range might be extended even further through the use of hypersensitization and <b>latensification</b> methods, without seriously affecting the grain size of the emulsion. In conclusion, then, fine grain emulsions (i. e. finer grained than Aero XX) in connection with 70 mm cameras may be used to produce results satisfactory for many purposes in Aerial Photography.
