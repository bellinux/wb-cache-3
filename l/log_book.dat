5|$|Electronic Logging Devices can {{be thought}} of as an {{automated}} electronic <b>log</b> <b>book.</b> An ELD records the same information as a manual paper <b>log</b> <b>book,</b> and requires less input from the driver. The ELD automatically records driving time and location, leaving the driver responsible only for reporting on-duty and off-duty time. In these respects, the ELD is less susceptible to forgery than a paper <b>log</b> <b>book.</b>|$|E
5|$|Keeping {{track of}} a driver's HOS {{requires}} {{the use of}} a <b>log</b> <b>book.</b> A truck driver's <b>log</b> <b>book</b> is a legally defined form containing a grid outlining the 24-hour day into 15-minute increments. The driver must specify where and when he/she stopped between driving shifts, what duties were performed (if any), along with the driver's name, truck number, company info, and other information. The driver must also present his or her <b>log</b> <b>book</b> to authorities upon request, for inspection. In lieu of a <b>log</b> <b>book,</b> a motor carrier may substitute an electronic on-board recorder to record the driver's hours.|$|E
5|$|Every {{driver of}} a CMV is {{required}} {{to keep track of}} his/her time with a <b>log</b> <b>book</b> or an ELD. A <b>log</b> <b>book</b> is simply a notebook with a grid pattern on every page, dividing the 24-hour day into 15-minute (1/4-hour) segments. Drivers are required to make carbon copies of each page, so one page may be kept with the driver (to be produced upon inspection by DOT officers), and so the other copy may be sent to the driver's employer.|$|E

5|$|The FMCSA is a {{division}} of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), which is generally responsible for enforcement of FMCSA regulations. The driver of a CMV is required to keep a record of working hours using a <b>log</b> <b>book,</b> outlining the total number of hours spent driving and resting, as well as the time at which the change of duty status occurred. In lieu of a <b>log</b> <b>book,</b> a motor carrier may keep track of a driver's hours using Electronic Logging Devices (ELDs), which automatically record {{the amount of time spent}} driving the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|FMCSA rules {{require that}} a <b>log</b> <b>book</b> (or ELD) must record for each change of duty status (e.g., {{the place of}} {{reporting}} for work, or starting to drive), {{the name of the}} city, town or village, with state abbreviation. If a change of duty status occurs at a location other than a city, the highway number and nearest milepost or the nearest two intersecting roadways followed by the name of the nearest city must be recorded. In addition to the time grid, a <b>log</b> <b>book</b> must record the date, total miles driven for the day, truck and trailer number, name of carrier, bill of lading number, and the driver's signature. The driver is required to retain a copy of each log page for the previous seven consecutive days which must be in his/her possession and available for inspection while on-duty.|$|E

5|$|Drivers can {{get away}} with this rule-breaking due to their paper-based log books. As a driver records their time spent behind the wheel, there is very little to stop them from forging their log books. There is very {{superficial}} oversight and some drivers take advantage of this fact. Surveys indicate that between 25% and 75% of drivers violate the HOS. Other drivers maintain more than one <b>log</b> <b>book,</b> showing falsified versions to enforcement officers.|$|E
5|$|First Class : This {{advancement}} badge is {{the first}} advancement badge that places the Scout {{in a position of}} leadership and organisation. A Scout is required to plan and run a wide game for their Patrol, a Patrol camp, an overnight Patrol hike for which a <b>log</b> <b>book</b> must be written, a programme to teach younger Scouts in their Patrol about pioneering, and they need to assist in the planning of a Scouts' Own.|$|E
5|$|McCudden {{remained}} in England until July 1918 {{when he was}} given command of No. 60 Squadron RAF. He flew to Farnborough in a Vickers F.B.16 to collect his new Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5a before returning to France to lead his new Squadron. On 3 July he flew back in this fighter and over his home in Kingston upon Thames, taking the aircraft to 17,000 feet and circling London for an hour. When he landed he made his last entry into his <b>log</b> <b>book.</b> His total flying time had reached 872 hours and 40 minutes.|$|E

It was perhaps on exaggeration but no record remains to certify what McCudden did. He did note the maximum ground-level speed as 135mph in his <b>log</b> <b>book.</b> He achieved these feats with the limited resources of a front-line squadron and without any official assistance.|$|E
5|$|Hunter (1991) {{has been}} {{described}} as the first sandbox game featuring full 3D, third-person graphics, thus making it an important precursor to the Grand Theft Auto series. The game consisted of a large, open world in which there were numerous possibilities to complete different missions. The character could travel on foot, or steal different vehicles such as cars, tanks, or even bicycles, boats, helicopters and hovercrafts. Moreover, Hunter also had many unique features such as day and night lighting, fuel modelling, a <b>log</b> <b>book,</b> aerial observation units, tank traps, land mines and computer-controlled rocket batteries and tracer guns. It was also possible to ride a bicycle, swim, windsurf or even make a parachute jump from a helicopter.|$|E
5|$|Transport Canada {{released}} its report on July 30, 2008. It blamed weather conditions, but also focused on driver fatigue and driver error. It cited several breaches of provincial law regarding {{the operation of}} commercial vehicles. The coach had been on duty for sixteen hours when the collision happened, contravening the law that one cannot drive {{if they have been}} working more than fourteen consecutive hours. The report also identified inadequate pre-trip inspections and <b>log</b> <b>book</b> keeping, and the lack of a contingency plan in the event of poor weather. Transport Canada stated that although they put an added emphasis on some factors, their report was consistent with the RCMP's. They concurred that the vehicle would have failed an inspection in its pre-collision state because of worn tires and brakes.|$|E

Orsborne was able to obtain further fuel and water, but Girl Pats arrival {{attracted the attention of}} the local Lloyd's agent, who had been on the lookout for the vessel. On 26 May he saw Orsborne and inspected the <b>log</b> <b>book,</b> where he discovered the false names and other inconsistencies. Orsborne was asked to present the ship's papers at the British consulate but, on the pretext that he needed to test the engines, he rapidly put to sea. The appearance of Girl Pat in Dakar—the first confirmation since Corcubión that the vessel was still afloat—was widely reported. Relatives of the crew members were relieved that those aboard were safe but were apprehensive about what might lie ahead.|$|E
