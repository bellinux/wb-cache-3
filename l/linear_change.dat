25|$|Common {{mobile phases}} used include any {{miscible}} combination {{of water with}} various organic solvents (the most common are acetonitrile and methanol). Some HPLC techniques use water-free mobile phases (see Normal-phase chromatography below). The aqueous component of the mobile phase may contain acids (such as formic, phosphoric or trifluoroacetic acid) or salts {{to assist in the}} separation of the sample components. The composition of the mobile phase may be kept constant ("isocratic elution mode") or varied ("gradient elution mode") during the chromatographic analysis. Isocratic elution is typically effective in the separation of sample components that are very different in their affinity for the stationary phase. In gradient elution the composition of the mobile phase is varied typically from low to high eluting strength. The eluting strength of the mobile phase is reflected by analyte retention times with high eluting strength producing fast elution (=short retention times). A typical gradient profile in reversed phase chromatography might start at 5% acetonitrile (in water or aqueous buffer) and progress linearly to 95% acetonitrile over 5–25 minutes. Periods of constant mobile phase composition may be part of any gradient profile. For example, the mobile phase composition may be kept constant at 5% acetonitrile for 1–3 min, followed by a <b>linear</b> <b>change</b> up to 95% acetonitrile.|$|E

Evaluation of callus speed of sound, acoustic reflection and attenuation showed significant <b>linear</b> <b>changes</b> over time during early DO stage (p < 0. 05).

Materials and Methods Forty-seven Caucasian subjects with Class II division 1 were recruited. 3 D images captured of each subject, pre-treatment (T 1), with the PWB (T 2) {{and at the end of}} treatment (T 3). Soft tissue volumetric and <b>linear</b> <b>changes</b> as well as the correlation between facial parameters and successful treatment were calculated. Results The mean soft tissue volumetric change from T 1 to T 3 was 22. 24 ± 16. 73 cm³. Soft tissue profile <b>linear</b> <b>changes</b> from T 1 -T 3 for lower facial landmarks were 4 - 5 mm. From T 1 -T 3, the mean soft tissue volumetric change of the total sample was 60 % of the change produced by the PWB (T 1 to T 2). Correlations were weak for all 3 D facial parameters and successful overjet reduction. Facial expression changes were only significant for the lower landmarks. Conclusions 1 TBA treatment, in growing subjects, increased the lower facial soft tissue volume and caused forward movement of the lower soft tissue facial profile landmarks. 2 The PWB can be used to estimate the treatment outcome of the TBA on soft tissue profile changes. 3 No association was found between soft tissue landmark variables and successful overjet reduction. 4 TBA treatment had no effect on the upper facial landmarks for each facial expression but it changed the lower facial expressions significantly except for maximal smile in males...|$|R

Sensitivity for smoothness perception of linear temporal transitions and flicker visibility was tested. Stimuli {{in the first}} experiment were linear color transitions, varying in either lightness, chroma or hue, around a base color represented in CIE LCh. Results show a significantly lower smoothness threshold for lightness changes than for chroma and hue changes. Moreover, the thresholds for lightness change show independence from the chroma and hue of the base color in contrast to thresholds for chroma and hue changes. A difference between the sensitivity for chroma and hue changes was also demonstrated. In the second experiment, the sensitivity for linear transitions is compared to flicker sensitivity for the same base colors. Results show that visibility thresholds for flicker are {{significantly lower than the}} thresholds smoothness of <b>linear</b> <b>changes,</b> demonstrating an influence of the type of change to the temporal sensitivity.
