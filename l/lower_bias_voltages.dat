Coating and interlayer thickness values were determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) which also revealed {{the presence of a}} gradient layer at the coating substrate interface. Coatings were evaluated in terms of the hardness, elastic modulus, wear behavior and adhesion. Deposition rate generally increased with increasing bias voltage and increasing gas pressure. At low working gas pressures, hardness and modulus of elasticity increased with increasing bias voltage. Reduced hardness and modulus of elasticity were observed at higher gas pressures. Increased adhesion was generally observed at <b>lower</b> <b>bias</b> <b>voltages</b> and higher gas pressures. All DLC coatings significantly improved the overall wear resistance of the base material. Lower wear rates were observed for coatings deposited with <b>lower</b> <b>bias</b> <b>voltages.</b> For coatings that showed wear tracks considerably deeper than the coating thickness but without spallation, the wear behavior was largely attributed to deformation of both the coating and substrate with some cracks at the wear track edges.

When lighter elements {{are incorporated into}} the multilayer at a <b>lower</b> <b>bias</b> <b>voltage</b> (U-B = - 75 V) pronounced { 111 } or { 110 }, textures develop which {{are determined by the}} dominating species present.

Additionally, there is a strong indication that in the case when heavy elements (> 89) are involved in the growth process, which evolves by continuous re-nucleation. Conversely, when only light elements (< 52) are involved then the coating evolves by competitive growth.

The optically assisted IV method was used with the Si wafer as hot carrier (HC) absorber and the Si QD array as energy selective contact (ESC).

Ionization chambers (CIs) are considered the most important dosimeters for their high accuracy, practicality and reliability, allowing absolute dose measurements. However, they have a relative large physical size, which limits their spatial resolution, and require a high bias voltage to achieve an acceptable collection of charges, excluding their use for in vivo dosimetry. In this paper, we propose new real time radiation detectors with electrodes based on graphene or vertically aligned multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). We have investigated their charge collection efficiency and compared their performance with electrodes made of a conventional material. Moreover, in order to highlight the effect of nanocarbons, reference radiation detectors were also tested. The proposed dosimeters display an excellent linear response to dose and collect more charge than reference ones at a standard bias voltage, permitting the construction of miniaturized CIs. Moreover, an MWCNT based CI gives the best charge collection efficiency and it enables working also to <b>lower</b> <b>bias</b> <b>voltages</b> and zero volts, allowing in vivo applications.

We derive a numerically exact expression for the particle current and examine its characteristics as it evolves in time from the transient regime to the long-time steady-state regime. We find that just after switch-on the current initially overshoots the expected long-time steady-state value, oscillates and decays as a power law, and eventually settles to a steady-state value consistent with the value calculated using the Landauer formula. The power-law parameters depend on {{the values of the}} applied bias voltage, the strength of the couplings, and the speed of the switch-on. In particular, the oscillating transient current decays away longer for <b>lower</b> <b>bias</b> <b>voltages.</b> Furthermore, the power-law decay nature of the current suggests an equivalent series resistor-inductor-capacitor circuit wherein all of the components have time-dependent properties. Such dynamical resistive, inductive, and capacitive influences are generic in nano-circuites where dynamical switches are incorporated. We also examine the characteristics of the dynamical current in a nano-oscillator modeled by introducing a sinusoidally modulated interleads coupling between the two leads. We find that the current does not strictly follow the sinusoidal form of the coupling. In particular, the maximum current does not occur during times when the leads are exactly aligned. Instead, the times when the maximum current occurs depend on the values of the bias potential, nearest-neighbor coupling, and the interleads coupling.

30|$|Semiconductor based photo {{detectors}} such as avalanche photo diodes (APDs) and silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) {{in combination}} with fast scintillator crystal arrays have shown to be promising detector technologies for simultaneous PET/MR. Sub-mm spatial resolution {{can be achieved by}} one-to-one coupling of APDs and SiPMs to small pitched crystal arrays. However, this results in a high number of readout channels and electronics, resulting in increased power consumption. This paper evaluates the performance of a new type of PET detectors called sensitivity encoded silicon photomultiplier (SeSP), which allows a direct coupling of small pitch crystal arrays to the detector with a reduction in number of readout channels. Four SeSP devices have been investigated in this study, which were designed with two separate encoding schemes: 1 D and 2 D. Furthermore, both encoding schemes were manufactured in two different sizes of 4 × 4 mm 2 and 7.73 × 7.9 mm 2 in order to investigate the effect of size on detector parameters. All devices were coupled to LYSO crystal arrays with 1 mm pitch size and 10 mm height, with optical isolation between crystals. The characterization has been done for the key parameters of crystal-identification, energy resolution, time resolution, and dark noise ratio as a function of triggering threshold, over-voltage (OV), and temperature. Position information has been archived using a least square approach (LSQA) {{in combination with}} a mean light matrix around the photo-peak.

The current and the differential conductance of the systems are calculated and the influence caused by varying the lateral confinement on the device characteristics is investigated. Three representative systems are studied. First of all, a 1 D- 0 D- 1 D device, symmetric {{with respect to the}} current flow, with a variable lateral confinement in the double-barrier quantum-well (DBQW) region, is investigated. This device would in an experimental setup correspond to the structure in which a thin, lateral metallic gate is placed in the DBQW region. Subsequently, calculations are performed for two asymmetric 1 D- 0 D- 1 D devices, in which the strongest, but varying, lateral confinement is placed either in the collector or in the emitter region. In experiments, these two devices would correspond to the situations where a lateral metallic gate is positioned below or on top of the DBQW structure. The calculations predict several phenomena for the device characteristics. It is shown that as the lateral confinement increases, in addition to those normally observed current onsets and pinch-offs that move toward higher bias voltages, several current onsets and pinch-offs move towards <b>lower</b> <b>bias</b> <b>voltages.</b> These negative shifts of the current onsets and pinch-offs with increasing of the lateral confinement have so far not been expected for gated DBRT devices.

Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments have become important techniques in the investigation of the material properties on the atomic scale. For a long period ^ 3 He based detectors were extensively used for neutron detection in these experiments, but due to the scarcity of ^ 3 He, researchers started to look for alternatives. Scintillation based solid state detectors appeared as a prominent alternative. A neutron scattered by a sample under test impinges a scintillating material and initiates a nuclear reaction that produces secondary particles which in a second scattering process generate a light emission that can be detected by an underlying photodetector. By determining the neutron scattering angle, the momentum transfer of the scattered neutron can be identified. Using this information the investigated sample structure can be determined with very high spatial resolution. These experiments using scintillation based detectors rely on efficient detection of photons, hence on the performance of photodetectors. Silicon photomultipliers (SiPM), having <b>lower</b> <b>bias</b> <b>voltages</b> compared to photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), being able to operate in high magnetic fields, offering the possibility of modular design, and yielding higher readout rates have the potential to become a photon detector of choice in these experiments. The concern regarding SiPMs to be used in these experiments is especially their neutron radiation hardness. When exposed to the neutron irradiation, the amount of defects caused by the impinging neutrons increases the dark count rate and diminishes the photon detection efficiency in the SiPM.

For this purpose, we irradiated one digital and two different analog SiPM arrays with cold neutrons having 5 Å wavelength and up to a dose of 6 E 12 n/cm 2 at the KWS- 1 instrument of the Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum (MLZ) in Garching, Germany. As stated in [2] a dose for a 10 -year equivalent non-stop operation of the detector at the KWS- 1 instrument of the MLZ is expected to be around 8. 2 E 9 n/cm 2. We have used a customized measuring system for evaluating the PDE of the sensors. The used system consists of a monochromatic light source and a lock-in amplifier based readout for the wavelengths between UV and NIR parts of the spectra. The first result can be observed in Fig. 1 where a relative change of 3. 8 % in the PDE has been measured on the digital SiPM array after being irradiated up to 1. 85 E 12 n/cm 2...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, the {{collected}} charge and the Lorentz angle on non-irradiated and the irradiatedminiature {{of the current}} test silicon micro-strip sensors (ATLAS 12) of the future ATLAS innertracker are measured. The samples are irradiated up to 51015 1 MeV neq=cm 2 and some of themalso measured after short-term annealing (80 min at 60 C). The measurements are performedat the DESY II test beam, which provides the advantage of tracking to suppress noise hits. The collected charge is measured at various bias voltages for each sample. The results arecompared with the measurements performed using a Sr 90 radioactive source. It is shown thatthe measurements with beam and radioactive source are consistent with each other, and theadvantage of tracking at the beam measurements provides the measurement of collected chargeon highly irradiated sensors at <b>lower</b> <b>bias</b> <b>voltages.</b> The Lorentz angle is measured for each sample at dierent magnetic eld strengths between 0 T and 1 T, the results are extrapolated to 2 T, which is the magnetic eld in the inner trackerof the ATLAS detector. Most of the measurements are performed at [...] 500 V bias voltage,which is the planned operation bias voltage of the future strip tracker. Some samples are alsomeasured at dierent bias voltages to observe the eect of bias voltage on the Lorentz angle. Thesignal reconstruction of the strip sensors are performed using the lowest possible signal-to-noisethresholds. For non-irradiated samples, the measured Lorentz angle agrees with the prediction ofthe BFK model. On the irradiated samples, {{the results suggest that}} the Lorentz angle decreaseswith increasing bias voltage due to the increasing electric eld in the sensor. The Lorentz angledecreases with increasing irradiation level; however, if the sample is under-depleted, the eectof electric eld dominates and the Lorentz angle increases. Once the irradiation level becomestoo high, hence {{the collected}} charge is small due to increasing trapping, the visible eect ofthe Lorentz force in the detector decreases, therefore the measured Lorentz angle decreases. Short-term annealing increases the Lorentz angle, due to the decrease in full depletion voltage. However, on the highly irradiated samples the annealing further decreases the Lorentz angle. The analysis is also re-performed using the signal threshold that will be used in the digitalreadout of strip sensors at the future ATLAS inner tracker. It is seen that the visible eect ofthe Lorentz force decreases at lower uences due to the higher threshold...|$|E
40|$|We use a Born-Markov {{approximated}} master equation {{approach to}} study the symmetrized-in-frequency current noise spectrum and the oscillator steady state of a nanoelectromechanical system where a nanoscale resonator is coupled linearly via its momentum to a quantum point contact (QPC). Our current noise spectra exhibit clear signatures of the quantum correlations between the QPC current and the back-action force on the oscillator at a value of the relative tunneling phase (η = -π/ 2) where such correlations {{are expected to be}} maximized. We also show that the steady state of the oscillator obeys a classical Fokker-Planck equation, but can experience thermomechanical noise squeezing {{in the presence of a}} momentum-coupled detector bath and a position-coupled environmental bath. Besides, the full master equation clearly shows that half of the detector back-action is correlated with electron tunneling, indicating a departure from the model of the detector as an effective bath and suggesting that a future calculation valid at <b>lower</b> <b>bias</b> <b>voltage,</b> stronger tunneling and/or stronger coupling might reveal interesting quantum effects in the oscillator dynamics.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the present}} study, the {{structural}} and transport properties of single wall gallium nitride nanotubes (SWGaNNTS) were theoretically studied by using ab-initio calculations under density functional theory (DFT) with TranSIESTA code employing norm-conserving pseudopotential. During the calculation, the tetragonal supercell geometry has been chosen and the relaxed atomic position {{was used by}} applying the conjugate gradients (CG) method in molecular dynamics. Maximum force tolerance in CG coordinates optimization set at 0. 04 eV/Å. In these computations exchange-correlation energies were obtained using local density approximation (LDA). The {{results showed that the}} curvature has prominent effect on the band structure of SWGaNNTs, the energy bandgap decreases as the decrease the diameter. The calculated bandgap of (9, 0) is 1. 8126 eV are good experiment with the previous reported by theoretical studies. It is also observed that, there is a corresponding relation between the electronic transport properties and the valley of state density of GaNNT. In addition, the I-V graph of GaNNT is approximately linear for <b>lower</b> <b>bias</b> <b>voltage</b> and increases rapidly after that show ballistic transmission...|$|R
40|$|Diamond-like carbon (DLC) {{films have}} a high {{potential}} as piezoresistors in sensors for microtechnology applications. Since {{it has been reported}} that some films show very high strain sensitivity, DLC seems well suited for the use in highly sensitive sensors, e. g. force sensors for the nano Newton region. For DLC films produced by PECVD from hydrocarbons, the process parameters influencing the piezoresistive properties were systematically investigated. Therefore, pressure, gas flow, and substrate <b>bias</b> <b>voltage</b> were varied. The influence of the different parameters, especially on the strain sensitivity of the films, is discussed in this paper. An increase in gas flow and pressure leads to an increased gauge factor. Furthermore, higher strain sensitivity is achieved at <b>lower</b> substrate <b>bias</b> <b>voltages.</b> The different process parameters were optimized for the use of DLC films as piezoresistors in highly sensitive force sensors...|$|R
