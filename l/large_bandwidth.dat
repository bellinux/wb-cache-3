25|$|One of the {{drawbacks}} of crystal sets {{is that they}} are vulnerable to interference from stations near in frequency to the desired station; that is to say, they have low selectivity. Often two or more stations are heard simultaneously. This is because the simple tuned circuit does not reject nearby signals well; it allows a wide band of frequencies to pass through, that is, it has a <b>large</b> <b>bandwidth</b> (low Q factor) compared to modern receivers.|$|E
25|$|The {{breakthrough}} in nano-FTIR {{came upon the}} development of high-power broadband mid-IR laser sources, which provided large spectral irradiance in a sufficiently <b>large</b> <b>bandwidth</b> (mW-level power in ~1000cm-1 bandwidth) and enabled truly broadband nanoscale-resolved material spectroscopy capable of detecting even the weakest vibrational resonances. Particularly, {{it has been shown}} that nano-FTIR is capable of measuring molecular fingerprints which match well with far-field FTIR spectra, owing to the asymmetry of the nano-FTIR spectrometer that provides phase and thus gives access to the molecular absorption. Recently, the first nanoscale-resolved infrared hyperspectral imaging of a co-polymer blend was demonstrated, which allowed for the application of statistical techniques such as multivariate analysis – a widely used tool for heterogeneous sample analysis.|$|E
25|$|Nano-FTIR {{was first}} {{described}} in 2005 in a patent by Ocelic and Hillenbrand as Fourier transform spectroscopy of tip-scattered light with an asymmetric spectrometer (i.e. the tip/sample placed {{inside one of}} the interferometer arms). The first realization of s-SNOM with FTIR was demonstrated in 2006 in the laboratory of F. Keilmann using a mid-infrared source based on a simple version of nonlinear difference-frequency generation (DFG). However, the mid-IR spectra in this realization were recorded using dual comb spectroscopy principles, yielding a discrete set of frequencies and thus demonstrating a multiheterodyne imaging technique rather than nano-FTIR. The first continuous spectra were recorded only in 2009 in the same laboratory using a supercontinuum IR beam also obtained by DFG in GaSe upon superimposing two pulsed trains emitted from Er-doped fiber laser. This source further allowed in 2011 for the first assessment of nanoscale-resolved spectra of SiC with excellent quality and spectral resolution. At the same time, Huth et al. in the laboratory of R. Hillenbrand used IR radiation from a simple glowbar source in combination with the principles of Fourier transform spectroscopy, to record IR spectra of p-doped Si and its oxides in a semiconductor device. In the same work the term nano-FTIR was first introduced. However, an insufficient spectral irradiance of glowbar sources limited the applicability of the technique to the detection of strongly-resonant excitations such phonons; and the early supercontinuum IR laser sources, while providing more power, had very narrow bandwidth (<300nbsp&cm−1). Further attempt to improve the spectral power, while retaining the <b>large</b> <b>bandwidth</b> of a glowbar source was made by utilizing the IR radiation from a high temperature argon arc source (also known as plasma source). However, due to lack of commercial availability and rapid development of the IR supercontinium laser sources, plasma sources are not widely utilized in nano-FTIR.|$|E

2500|$|Limitation of single-sideband {{modulation}} {{being used}} for voice signals and not available for video/TV signals leads to the usage of vestigial sideband.

It may also be used in digital transmission, such as the ATSC standardized 8VSB.
