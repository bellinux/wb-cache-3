5|$|The <b>left</b> <b>ventricle</b> is much thicker as {{compared}} with the right, due to the greater force needed to pump blood to the entire body. Like the right ventricle, the left also has trabeculae carneae, but there is no moderator band. The <b>left</b> <b>ventricle</b> pumps blood to the body through the aortic valve and into the aorta. Two small openings above the aortic valve carry blood to the heart itself, the left main coronary artery and the right coronary artery.|$|E

5|$|The left atrium {{receives}} oxygenated blood {{back from}} the lungs via {{one of the four}} pulmonary veins. The left atrium has an outpouching called the left atrial appendage. Like the right atrium, the left atrium is lined by pectinate muscles. The left atrium is connected to the <b>left</b> <b>ventricle</b> by the mitral valve.|$|E
5|$|The {{coronary}} sinus {{is a large}} vein that drains {{into the}} right atrium, and receives most of the venous drainage of the heart. It receives blood from the great cardiac vein (receiving the left atrium and both ventricles), the posterior cardiac vein (draining {{the back of the}} <b>left</b> <b>ventricle),</b> the middle cardiac vein (draining the bottom of the left and right ventricles), and small cardiac veins. The anterior cardiac veins drain the front of the right ventricle and drain directly into the right atrium.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the cardiac cycle, in early diastole, both the atria and ventricles are relaxed. Since blood moves from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, when the chambers are relaxed, blood will flow into the atria (through the coronary sinus and the pulmonary veins). As the atria begin to fill, the pressure will rise so that the blood will move from the atria into the ventricles. In late diastole the atria contract, pumping more blood into the ventricles. This causes a rise in pressure in the ventricles. As the ventricles reach systole, blood will be pumped into the pulmonary artery (right ventricle) or aorta (<b>left</b> <b>ventricle).</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the general cause of beta-adrenergic receptor neuroeffector abnormalities in the failing human heart, we measured ventricular myocardial adrenergic receptors, adrenergic neurotransmitters, and beta-adrenergic receptor-effector responses in nonfailing and failing hearts taken from nonfailing organ donors, subjects with endstage biventricular failure due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC), and subjects with primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) who exhibited isolated right ventricular failure. Relative to nonfailing PPH <b>left</b> <b>ventricles,</b> failing PPH right ventricles exhibited (a) markedly decreased beta 1 -adrenergic receptor density, (b) marked depletion of tissue norepinephrine and neuropeptide Y, (c) decreased adenylate cyclase stimulation {{in response to the}} beta agonists isoproterenol and zinterol, and (d) decreased adenylate cyclase stimulation in response to Gpp(NH) p and forskolin. These abnormalities were directionally similar to, but generally more pronounced than, corresponding findings in failing IDC right ventricles, whereas values for these parameters in nonfailing <b>left</b> <b>ventricles</b> of PPH subjects were similar to values in the nonfailing <b>left</b> <b>ventricles</b> of organ donors. Additionally, relative to paired nonfailing PPH <b>left</b> <b>ventricles</b> and nonfailing right ventricles from organ donors, failing right ventricles from PPH subjects exhibited decreased adenylate cyclase stimulation by MnCl 2. These data indicate that: (a) Adrenergic neuroeffector abnormalities present in the failing human heart are due to local mechanisms; systemic processes do not produce beta-adrenergic neuroeffector abnormalities. (b) Pressure-overloaded failing right ventricles of PPH subjects exhibit decreased activity of the catalytic subunit of adenylate cyclase, an abnormality not previously described in the failing human heart...|$|R

Having smoked approximately 3 packs of cigarettes per day for nearly 20 years, Cheney had his first of five heart attacks in 1978, at age 37. Subsequent attacks in 1984, 1988, 2000, and 2010 have resulted in moderate contractile dysfunction of his <b>left</b> <b>ventricle.</b> He underwent four-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting in 1988, coronary artery stenting in November 2000, urgent coronary balloon angioplasty in March 2001, and the implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in June, 2001.|$|E
5|$|In {{the left}} heart, oxygenated blood is {{returned}} to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. It is then pumped into the <b>left</b> <b>ventricle</b> through the mitral valve and into the aorta through the aortic valve for systemic circulation. The aorta is a large artery that branches into many smaller arteries, arterioles, and ultimately capillaries. In the capillaries, oxygen and nutrients from blood are supplied to body cells for metabolism, and exchanged for carbon dioxide and waste products. Capillary blood, now deoxygenated, travels into venules and veins that ultimately collect in the superior and inferior vena cavae, and into the right heart.|$|E
5|$|The Greek {{physician}} Galen (2nd century CE) knew {{blood vessels}} carried blood and identified venous (dark red) and arterial (brighter and thinner) blood, each with distinct and separate functions. Galen, noting the heart as the hottest organ in the body, {{concluded that it}} provided heat to the body. The heart did not pump blood around, the heart's motion sucked blood in during diastole and the blood moved by the pulsation of the arteries themselves. Galen believed the arterial blood was created by venous blood passing from the <b>left</b> <b>ventricle</b> to the right through 'pores' between the ventricles. Air from the lungs passed from the lungs via the pulmonary artery {{to the left side}} of the heart and created arterial blood.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine beta-adrenergic {{receptor}} signal transduction in denervated, previously transplanted human ventricular myocardium. Background. In model systems, surgical denervation typically results in both presynaptic and postsynaptic supersensitivity in beta-adrenergic receptor pathways and alteration in G protein-mediated signal transduction. Methods. We examined beta-adrenergic receptor signal transduction in the <b>left</b> and right <b>ventricles</b> removed from nine subjects with a previous transplant and surgical denervation 25 ± 4 months after their first transplantation. Twenty-six hearts removed from organ donors served as control hearts. Results. Total beta-adrenergic receptor density and stimulation of muscle contraction in isolated right ventricular trabeculae by the nonselective agonist isoproterenol were similar in the transplant and donor groups. Beta 1 -receptor density was not in the <b>left</b> <b>ventricles</b> of the two group but tended to be reduced (by 29 %, p = 0. 09) in transplant right ventricles. By contrast, betah 2 -receptor density was higher in transplant <b>left</b> and right <b>ventricles</b> relative to the respective values in donor ventricles by 33 % in <b>left</b> <b>ventricles</b> and 97 % in right ventricles (both p < 0. 05). Isoproterenol, which in particulate fractions of human heart stimulate adenylyl cyclase primarily via beta 2 -receptors, produced a greater increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate generation in membranes prepared from transplant <b>left</b> <b>ventricles</b> and right ventricles compared with donors. In contrast, guanosine 5 ′-[beta,gamma-imido]triphosphate, sodium fluoride and forskolin, which stimulate adenylyl cyclase through nonreceptor/G protein-sensitive mechanisms, yielded similar degress of adenylyl cyclase stimulation in the two group, and both pertussis toxin- and cholera toxin-catalyzed adenosine diphosphate ribosylation were not altered in transplanted <b>left</b> <b>ventricles.</b> Conclusions. These data indicate that the transplanted human heart exhibits an up-regulation of functional beta 2 adrenergic receptors...|$|R
40|$|Tracking of <b>left</b> <b>ventricles</b> in 3 D {{echocardiography}} is {{a challenging}} topic {{because of the}} poor quality of ultrasound images and the speed consideration. In this paper, a fast and accurate learning based 3 D tracking algorithm is presented. A novel one-step forward prediction is proposed to generate the motion prior using motion manifold learning. Collaborative trackers are introduced to achieve both temporal consistence and tracking robustness. The algorithm is completely automatic and computationally efficient. The mean point-to-mesh error of our algorithm is 1. 28 mm. It requires less than 1. 5 seconds to process a 3 D volume (160 × 148 × 208 voxels).

50|$|The supramitral ring is a {{connective}} tissue ring {{at the base}} of the atrial surfaces of the mitral valve leaflets. They may protrude into the orifice of the mitral valve, leading to fixed obstruction of blood flow from the left atria to the <b>left</b> <b>ventricles.</b>|$|R
5|$|The valves {{between the}} atria and ventricles {{are called the}} {{atrioventricular}} valves. Between the right atrium and the right ventricle is the tricuspid valve. The tricuspid valve has three cusps, which connect to chordae tendinae and three papillary muscles named the anterior, posterior, and septal muscles, after their relative positions. The mitral valve lies between the left atrium and <b>left</b> <b>ventricle.</b> It {{is also known as}} the bicuspid valve due to its having two cusps, an anterior and a posterior cusp. These cusps are also attached via chordae tendinae to two papillary muscles projecting from the ventricular wall.|$|E
5|$|Troponin is a {{sensitive}} biomarker {{for a heart}} with insufficient blood supply. It is released 4–6 hours after injury, and usually peaks at about 12–24 hours. Two tests of troponin are often taken – one {{at the time of}} initial presentation, and another within 3–6 hours, with either a high level or a significant rise being diagnostic. A test for brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) can be used to evaluate for the presence of heart failure, and rises when there is increased demand on the <b>left</b> <b>ventricle.</b> These tests are considered biomarkers because they are highly specific for cardiac disease. Testing for the MB form of creatine kinase provides information about the heart's blood supply, but is used less frequently because it is less specific and sensitive.|$|E
5|$|Capillaries are {{organized}} into capillary beds in tissues; {{it is here}} that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart. Once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium, then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen. Oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the <b>left</b> <b>ventricle</b> where it is pumped out to the body.|$|E

5|$|Small lymphatic {{networks}} called plexuses exist beneath each of {{the three}} layers of the heart. These networks collect into a main left and a main right trunk, which travel up the groove between the ventricles that exists on the heart's surface, receiving smaller vessels as they travel up. These vessels then travel into the atrioventricular groove, and receive a third vessel which drains the section of the <b>left</b> <b>ventricle</b> sitting on the diaphragm. The left vessel joins with this third vessel, and travels along the pulmonary artery and left atrium, ending in the inferior tracheobronchial node. The right vessel travels along the right atrium and the part of the right ventricle sitting on the diaphragm. It usually then travels in front of the ascending aorta and then ends in a brachiocephalic node.|$|E
5|$|The {{heart has}} four chambers, two upper atria, the {{receiving}} chambers, and two lower ventricles, the discharging chambers. The atria open into the ventricles via the atrioventricular valves, {{present in the}} atrioventricular septum. This distinction is visible also {{on the surface of}} the heart as the coronary sulcus. There is an ear-shaped structure in the upper right atrium called the right atrial appendage, or auricle, and another in the upper left atrium, the left atrial appendage. The right atrium and the right ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the right heart. Similarly, the left atrium and the <b>left</b> <b>ventricle</b> together are sometimes referred to as the left heart. The ventricles are separated from each other by the interventricular septum, visible {{on the surface of the}} heart as the anterior longitudinal sulcus and the posterior interventricular sulcus.|$|E
5|$|The heart pumps blood with {{a rhythm}} {{determined}} {{by a group of}} pacemaking cells in the sinoatrial node. These generate a current that causes contraction of the heart, traveling through the atrioventricular node and along the conduction system of the heart. The heart receives blood low in oxygen from the systemic circulation, which enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and passes to the right ventricle. From here it is pumped into the pulmonary circulation, through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide. Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium, passes through the <b>left</b> <b>ventricle</b> and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulation−where the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide. The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 beats per minute. Exercise temporarily increases the rate, but lowers resting heart rate in the long term, and is good for heart health.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that oxygen radicals are involved in the development of tissue injury in hypertension. To prevent oxidative stress, there are antioxidant systems inside the cells such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione reducatase (GR), catalase (CAT) and glutathione S-transferase (GST). In this study changes in these antioxidant activities were estimated in the outer wall of the <b>left</b> <b>ventricles</b> from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), stroke prone SHR (SHRSP) and normal Wister Kyoto rats (WKY). The activities of manganese-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), which local-izes in mitochondria and GST were lower in the <b>left</b> <b>ventricles</b> of SHR and SHRSP compared to those in WKY.

50|$|The {{papillary}} {{muscles of}} both the right and <b>left</b> <b>ventricles</b> begin to contract shortly before ventricular systole and maintain tension throughout.

5|$|The {{mammalian}} {{heart has}} four chambers, two upper atria, the receiving chambers, and two lower ventricles, the discharging chambers. The heart has four valves, which separate its chambers and ensures blood flows {{in the correct}} direction through the heart (preventing backflow). After gas exchange in the pulmonary capillaries (blood vessels in the lungs), oxygen-rich blood returns to the left atrium via {{one of the four}} pulmonary veins. Blood flows nearly continuously back into the atrium, which acts as the receiving chamber, and from here through an opening into the <b>left</b> <b>ventricle.</b> Most blood flows passively into the heart while both the atria and ventricles are relaxed, but {{toward the end of the}} ventricular relaxation period, the left atrium will contract, pumping blood into the ventricle. The heart also requires nutrients and oxygen found in blood like other muscles, and is supplied via coronary arteries.|$|E
5|$|The {{sinoatrial node}} {{is found in}} {{the upper part of the}} right atrium near to the {{junction}} with the superior vena cava. The electrical signal generated by the sinoatrial node travels through the right atrium in a radial way that is not completely understood. It travels to the left atrium via Bachmann's bundle, such that the muscles of the left and right atria contract together. The signal then travels to the atrioventricular node. This is found at the bottom of the right atrium in the atrioventricular septum—the boundary between the right atrium and the <b>left</b> <b>ventricle.</b> The septum is part of the cardiac skeleton, tissue within the heart that the electrical signal cannot pass through, which forces the signal to pass through the atrioventricular node only. The signal then travels along the bundle of His to left and right bundle branches through to the ventricles of the heart. In the ventricles the signal is carried by specialized tissue called the Purkinje fibers which then transmit the electric charge to the heart muscle.|$|E
25|$|Acute MI (as {{may occur}} {{due to the}} sudden rupture of a chorda tendinae or {{papillary}} muscle) causes a sudden volume overload of both the left atrium and the <b>left</b> <b>ventricle.</b> The <b>left</b> <b>ventricle</b> develops volume overload because with every contraction it now has to pump out not only the volume of blood {{that goes into the}} aorta (the forward cardiac output or forward stroke volume) but also the blood that regurgitates into the left atrium (the regurgitant volume). The combination of the forward stroke volume and the regurgitant volume is known as the total stroke volume of the <b>left</b> <b>ventricle.</b>|$|E
