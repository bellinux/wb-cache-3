This study compares the sampling errors of the observation impact statistics (OBIS) of July 2011 and January 2012 using two methods. One method uses the random error under the assumption that the samples are independent, and the other method uses the error with <b>lag</b> <b>correlation</b> under the assumption that the samples are correlated with each other. The OBIS are obtained using the forecast sensitivity to observation (FSO) tool in the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) unified model (UM). To verify the self-correlation of the observation impact data, the lag correlations of the observation impact data at 00 UTC in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) summer months (June, July and August 2011) and winter months (December 2011 and January and February 2012) are calculated. The self-correlation approaches zero at 6 days for the summer, whereas it approaches zero at 4 days for the winter, which implies that the observation impact data are serially correlated. The sampling error considering <b>lag</b> <b>correlation</b> is larger than the random error for NH summer and winter. While the random sampling error is approximately 12 – 13 % of the approximation error, the sampling error considering the <b>lag</b> <b>correlation</b> is approximately half of the approximation error of the OBIS.

40|$|A {{new concept}} for fl ood {{modelling}} of lake levels has been introduced, analysed, and tested for Lake Wakatipu in the South Island of New Zealand. Lake level response to signifi cant rainfall events is substantially different from rivers. Lakes usually have enormous storage {{to absorb the}} peak of the fl ood event, and their outfl ows are dependent on their level rather than the infl ows. The new concept is based on carrying out a <b>lagged</b> <b>correlation</b> analysis between hourly data for the cumulative rainfall and the total rise of the lake level {{in order to determine the}} lagged time series of total lake rise which will provide the best projection for its forecast onto the cumulative rainfall. The focus has been to carry out this analysis on hourly data during signifi cant rainfall events which resulted in signifi cant lake rise. In return, the time frame for such analysis is usually several hours or few days, as is the case for Lake Wakatipu. Thus, some variables which are usually considered for lake analysis, such as evapotranspira-tion, can be negligible compared with the huge amount of rain causing the fl ood event. Based on the best <b>lagged</b> <b>correlation,</b> three models have been derived to forecast fl ood levels of Lake Wakatipu.
