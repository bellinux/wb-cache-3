40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the undergraduates’ {{attitude}} as correlates of their academic achievement in cataloguing and classification in <b>library</b> <b>schools</b> in Southern Nigeria. Cataloguing and classification courses are {{the heart and soul}} of librarianship but some undergraduates will avoid the courses if they are made optional courses in <b>library</b> <b>schools.</b> Cataloguing and classification are compulsory in <b>library</b> <b>schools</b> in Nigeria; students are expected to pass the courses before they graduate but it was observed that some students failed the courses and were not able to graduate. Two research questions and one hypothesis were used for the study. Survey research of correlational type was adopted for the study. Final year constituted the population of this study. Purposive sampling technique was used to select all the 550 final year undergraduates in <b>library</b> <b>schools</b> in Southern Nigeria. Questionnaire was the main instrument used to collect data in this study. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to present the results of the research questions and hypothesis respectively. Findings from the study revealed that: 397 out of 550 questionnaires were returned and found usable for the analysis; undergraduates in the <b>library</b> <b>schools</b> in Southern Nigeria had negative attitude (- 1. 30) towards cataloguing and classification; majority 261 (65. 7 %) of the undergraduates’ academic achievement was at average level and there was significant correlation between attitude and classification. The following recommendations were made to improve undergraduates’ achievement in cataloguing and classification courses: students should have positive attitude towards cataloguing and classification in <b>library</b> <b>schools</b> in Nigeria; lecturers should encourage the undergraduates to have positive attitude towards cataloguing and classification with the use of student-centred teaching methods which may improve their academic achievement in the courses and cataloguing and classification laboratory should be provided in the <b>library</b> <b>schools</b> to balance theories with practical to improve the achievement of the undergraduates in cataloguing and classification courses...|$|R

Two centuries later, the extraordinary circumstances of the foundations of Australian theatre were recounted in Our Country's Good by Timberlake Wertenbaker: the participants were prisoners watched by sadistic guards and the leading lady was under threat of the death penalty. The play is based on Thomas Keneally's novel The Playmaker. The Theatre Royal, Hobart, opened in 1837 and it remains the oldest theatre in Australia.

25|$|In 1883 Dewey became {{librarian}} of Columbia College, and in {{the following}} year founded there the School of Library Economy, the first institution for the instruction of librarians ever organized. The proposal to establish the school was approved by the college's Board of Trustees on 5 May 1884. After a period of preparation, the school was officially opened on 5 January 1887, with an enrollment of 20 students—three men and 17 women. Women were admitted to the program at Dewey's insistence and against the wishes of the college's Regents. Although the school had a promising start, Dewey's conflicts with the university officials, in particular over the issue of the presence of women, led to its future being cast in doubt, and by 1888 it was apparent that Columbia intended to close it. However, at that point, Dewey, upon accepting a position with the New York State Library in Albany, successfully secured the agreement of its Regents to have the school transferred there. The formal transfer was accomplished in 1889, and the school, which was ultimately very successful, was re-established in Albany as the New York State <b>Library</b> <b>School</b> under Dewey's direction. (The school returned to Columbia's Manhattan campus in 1926.) Dewey did not forget his Columbia students. He petitioned the University of the State of New York, which granted degrees to those students who agreed to submit to examinations and produce a bibliography and thesis. Two students participated, including future ALA registrar and college archivist Nina Browne.|$|E

Rosa Gomez, an employee of Neighborhood Centers, said that the organization did not want Baker-Ripley to appear [...] "too fancy or official looking" [...] so as not to intimidate recent immigrants. The non-profit organization Project for Public Spaces assisted in the development of Baker-Ripley. The organizers consulted residents of Gulfton and Sharpstown on the design of the center. Susan Baker, the wife of James Baker, a former U.S. Secretary of State, organized a fundraising campaign for the center. The center offers English and computer classes. Neighborhood Centers received a United States Department of Education Promise Neighborhood planning grant, used to fund its Gulfton Promise Project, a program to guide residents from birth until they obtain careers.|$|E

In Part II, the development of <b>school</b> <b>libraries</b> is traced from the eighth century library at York to the <b>school</b> <b>library</b> media centres of the present day, with emphasis on British, American, and Australian <b>school</b> <b>libraries.</b> This chronological survey covers medieval English <b>school</b> <b>libraries,</b> the libraries of the grammar schools of sixteenth and seventeenth century Britain, the elementary and Sunday <b>school</b> <b>libraries</b> of the nineteenth century, the libraries of "public", academy, and independent secondary schools in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and the secondary, elementary, and Sunday <b>school</b> <b>libraries</b> of the twentieth century. In Part III, "Concepts of the School Library", the development of <b>school</b> <b>libraries</b> is considered in terms of the reasons for which such libraries have been established and maintained over the centuries. The five types of <b>school</b> <b>library</b> discussed are: the <b>school</b> <b>library</b> established to support the teaching and learning activities of the school; the <b>school</b> <b>library</b> established to provide recreational reading; the library established to serve both the school and the community; the <b>school</b> <b>library</b> established as a scholars' library to serve the needs of a particular group within the school; and the <b>school</b> <b>library</b> established as a memorial. The aim of the thesis has been to show that <b>school</b> <b>library</b> provision is a great deal older than has generally been assumed, and that the reasons for which the <b>school</b> <b>libraries</b> have been established and maintained have changed but little over the centuries...|$|R
