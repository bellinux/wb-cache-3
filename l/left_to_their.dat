5|$|The main {{other sources}} of non-Italian troops in the late Republic were subject provincials, allied cities and Rome's amici (satellite kings). During the late Republic, non-Italian units were led by their own native chiefs, and their {{internal}} organisation was <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> own commanders. The units varied widely in dress, equipment, and weapons. They were normally raised for specific campaigns and often disbanded soon afterwards, {{in a similar manner}} to the earlier socii militia legions.|$|E

Gilbert died in a 1940 and Esme in 1946 {{and the house was}} <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> daughter Esme Francis Cavendish. She and her husband tried to sell the house immediately in 1946 to help pay the death duties. However the Cavendish family did not succeed until thirteen years later in 1959 during which time the house was unoccupied and started to decay. It was sold at this time to Bristol City Council who still owns it today.|$|E

5|$|Each legion was {{normally}} {{partnered with}} an approximately {{equal number of}} allied (non-Roman) auxiliae troops. The addition of allied troops to the Roman army was a formalisation of the earlier arrangement of using light troops from the Socii and Latini, who had received Roman citizenship after the Social War. Auxiliary troops could be formed from either auxiliary light cavalry known as alae, auxiliary light infantry known as cohors auxiliae, or a flexible mixture of the two known as cohors equitata. Cavalry types included mounted archers (Latin: sagittarii) and heavy shock cavalry (Latin: cataphracti or clibanarii). Infantry could be armed with bows, slings, throwing spears, long swords, or thrusting spears. Auxiliary units were originally led by their own chiefs, and, in this period, their internal organisation was <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> commanders.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh Mountain sheep is a {{hardy breed}} that can scrape {{a living from}} the mountainous {{habitats}} where they spend the whole year. Being adept at exploiting their environment, they have local knowledge of their mountains and are <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> own devices, being gathered {{once or twice a}} year. Originally often horned, and various shades of brown or black, they were often of poor conformation and bedraggled appearance. More recently, scientific breeding has improved them and they have been exported to many parts of the world. They form part of the ancestry of various local breeds of sheep in Wales, the Llanwenog, the Lleyn sheep, the Kerry Hill, the badger-faced, the Welsh mule and the Beulah speckle-faced. In rural areas, sheep are still an important part of life with local livestock shows and sheep dog trials taking place annually.|$|E
5|$|Against this {{background}} the negotiations for the Treaty of Amiens started in October 1801. The minor {{participants in the}} negotiations between Great Britain and France (the Batavian Republic and Spain) were immediately presented with faits accomplis: the preliminary agreement ceded Ceylon, and guaranteed free English shipping to the Cape of Good Hope, without the Dutch even being consulted. The Dutch ambassador in France, Schimmelpenninck, who acted as the Dutch plenipotentiary, vainly protested that the Treaty of The Hague had guaranteed the Dutch colonies, and that France had promised {{not to make a}} separate peace. After this separate peace had been concluded, the British were left to negotiate with the minor French allies separately. This did not mean that the Dutch were completely <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> own devices: whenever French interests seemed to be in danger, France decisively intervened on its own behalf, as in the attempt to deduct the value of the Dutch fleet, surrendered in 1799, that the British had purchased from the Stadtholder, from the indemnification of the Prince of Orange.|$|E

25|$|In this period, many cities, {{including}} Ypres, Bruges and Ghent, obtained {{their city}} charter. The Hanseatic League stimulated {{trade in the}} region, and the period saw the erection of many Gothic cathedrals and city halls. With {{the decline of the}} Holy Roman emperors' power starting in the 13th century, the Low Countries were largely <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> own devices. The lack of imperial protection also meant that the French and English began vying for influence in the region.|$|E
25|$|The Fairfaxes were <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> fate. At {{about the}} same time, Hull itself {{narrowly}} escaped capture by the Queen's forces through the treachery of Sir John Hotham, the governor, and his son, {{the commander of the}} Lincolnshire Parliamentarians. The latter had been placed under arrest at the instance of Cromwell and of Colonel John Hutchinson, the governor of Nottingham Castle; he escaped to Hull, but both father and son were seized by the citizens and afterwards executed. More serious than an isolated act of treachery was the far-reaching Royalist plot, that had been detected in Parliament itself for complicity, in which Lord Conway, Edmund Waller the poet, and several members of both Houses were arrested.|$|E
25|$|By Soviet estimates, in August 1941 about 231 {{detachments}} {{were operating}} already. Units formed and inserted into Belarus totaled 437 {{by the end}} of the 1941, comprising more than 7,200 personnel. However, as the front line moved further away, conditions steadily worsened for the partisan units, as resources ran out, and there was no large-scale support from beyond the front until March 1942. One particular difficulty was the lack of radio communication, which was not addressed until April 1942. The partisan unit also lacked the support of local people. For several months, partisan units in Belarus were virtually <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> own devices; especially difficult was the winter of 1941-1942, with severe shortages in ammunition, medicine and supplies. The actions of partisans were generally uncoordinated.|$|E
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 1302, Emperor Michael IX (r. 1294-1320) {{launched}} a campaign which reached south to Magnesia. The Turks, awed by his large army, avoided battle. Michael sought to confront them, but was dissuaded by his generals. The Turks, encouraged, resumed their raids, virtually isolating him at Magnesia. His army dissolved without battle, as the local troops <b>left</b> <b>to</b> defend <b>their</b> homes, and the Alans, too, <b>left</b> <b>to</b> rejoin <b>their</b> families in Thrace. Michael was forced to withdraw by the sea, followed by another wave of refugees.|$|R

25|$|Fortna {{argues that}} peacekeepers have a {{positive}} impact on the peace process, despite often being sent to places where peace is most difficult to achieve. Peacekeeping is often looked at by detractors as ineffective, or unnecessary. Peace prevails when belligerents already have a vested interest in sustaining peace and therefore it could be argued that Peacekeepers play only a minor role in creating a strong foundation for enduring peace. Yet these causal reasons illustrate the important roles that Peacekeepers play in ensuring that peace lasts, especially when contrasted against situations in which belligerents are <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> own devices. These causal reasons thus illustrate the need for Peacekeeping and lay a foundation for the manner in which Peacekeeping operations can have a substantive impact on the post-conflict environment.|$|E
25|$|Whether by {{or against}} the wish of the home government, the limits of British {{authority}} continued to extend. The Basotho, who dwelt in the upper valleys of the Orange River, had subsisted under a semi-protectorate of the British government from 1843 to 1854; but having been <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> own resources on the abandonment of the Orange sovereignty, they fell into a long exhaustive warfare with the Boers of the Orange Free State. On the urgent petition of their chief Moshesh, they were proclaimed British subjects in 1868, and their territory {{became part of the}} Cape Colony in 1871 (see Basutoland). In the same year, the southeastern part of Bechuanaland was annexed to Britain under the title of Griqualand West. This annexation was a consequence of the discovery there of rich diamond mines, an event which was destined to have far-reaching results.|$|E
25|$|Sir George Grey became {{governor}} of the Cape Colony in 1854, {{and the development of}} the colony owes much to his administration. In his opinion, policy imposed upon the colony by the home government's policy of not governing beyond the Orange River was mistaken, and in 1858 he proposed a scheme for a confederation that would include all of South Africa, however it was rejected by Britain as being impractical. Sir George kept open a British road through Bechuanaland to the far interior, gaining the support of the missionaries Robert Moffat and David Livingstone. Sir George also attempted for the first time, missionary effort apart, to educate the Cape Xhosa and to firmly establish British authority among them, which the self-destruction of the Xhosa rendered easy. Beyond the Kei River, the Transkei Xhosa were <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> own devices.|$|E

25|$|While the Indian subcontinent has had invaders from Central Asia since ancient times, {{what made}} the Muslim invasions {{different}} is that unlike the preceding invaders who assimilated into the prevalent social system, the successful Muslim conquerors retained their Islamic identity and created new legal and administrative systems that challenged and usually in many cases superseded the existing systems of social conduct and ethics, even influencing the non-Muslim rivals and common masses to a large extent, though the non-Muslim population was <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> own laws and customs. They also introduced new cultural codes {{that in some ways}} were very different from the existing cultural codes. This led to the rise of a new Indian culture which was mixed in nature, different from ancient Indian culture. The overwhelming majority of Muslims in India were Indian natives converted to Islam. This factor also {{played an important role in}} the synthesis of cultures.|$|E
25|$|Some species brood their fertilized eggs: female paper {{nautilus}} construct {{shelters for}} the young, while Gonatiid squid carry a larva-laden membrane from the hooks on their arms. Other cephalopods deposit their young under rocks and aerate {{them with their}} tentacles hatching. Mostly the eggs are <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> own devices; many squid lay sausage-like bunches of eggs in crevices or occasionally on the sea floor. Cuttlefish lay eggs separately in cases and attach them to coral or algal fronds. Like Pacific salmon, cephalopods are mostly semelparous, spawning many small eggs in one batch and then dying. Cephalopods usually live fast and die young. Most of the energy extracted from their food is used for growing, and they mature rapidly to their adult size. Some gain as much as 12% of their body mass each day. Most live for one to two years, reproducing and then dying shortly thereafter.|$|E
25|$|Up {{till now}} {{the war in}} North America had been a {{relatively}} minor affair fought between English, Spanish, and French colonists who rallied their Indian allies to attack frontier settlements for trade and territorial advantage. The French {{were aware of the}} danger of their position between Rupert's Land in the north and the British colonies to the south, but the expansion of French settlements from Louisiana, along the Mississippi River to the Great Lakes and the Saint Lawrence River in Canada, threatened to encircle the British settlers. For the most part the English in North America had been <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> own devices, but the growing power of France had persuaded the new Tory ministry to take direct action to secure the colonies and its commerce for Britain. Regular troops were taken from Flanders for the Quebec campaign, but the naval expedition against the French stronghold in August 1711 ended in disaster.|$|E
