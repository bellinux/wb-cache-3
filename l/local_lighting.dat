50|$|There are {{a number}} of shading {{algorithms}} for rasterizers. All shading algorithms need to account for distance from light and the normal vector of the shaded object with respect to the incident direction of light. The fastest algorithms simply shade all pixels on any given triangle with a single lighting value, also known as flat shading. There is no way to create the illusion of smooth surfaces this way, except by subdividing into many small triangles. Algorithms can also separately shade vertices, and interpolate the lighting value of the vertices when drawing pixels. This is known as Gouraud shading. The slowest and most realistic approach is to calculate lighting separately for each pixel, also known as Phong shading. This performs bilinear interpolation of the normal vectors and uses the result to do <b>local</b> <b>lighting</b> calculation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Recently, {{wireless}} sensor and actuator networks (WSANs) {{have been}} widely discussed in many applications. In this paper, we propose an autonomous light control system based on the feedback from light sensors carried by users. Our design focuses on meeting users ’ preferences and energy efficiency. Both whole and <b>local</b> <b>lighting</b> devices are considered. Users ’ preferences may depend on their activities and profiles and two require-ment models are considered: binary satisfaction and continuous satisfaction models. For controlling whole lighting devices, two decision algorithms are proposed. For controlling <b>local</b> <b>lighting</b> devices, a surface-tracking scheme is proposed. Our solutions are autonomous because, as opposed to existing solutions, they can dynamically adapt to environment changes and {{do not need to}} track users ’ current locations. Simulations and prototyping results are presented to verify the effectiveness of our designs.

In {{scenes with}} dynamic geometry or moving light sources, {{this is a significant}} challenge and an area of ongoing research. Using global illumination methods for general geometry would be either too slow or too inaccurate to solve this problem. In the special case of height field geometry, simplifying assumptions can be made that result in increased efficiency to allow real-time soft shadows from dynamic height field geometry. Our methods extends an existing method by Snyder et al. [SN 08] for soft shadows in height fields from environment lighting with two main contributions: • Self-Visibility: An efficient method to compute the visibility of the spherical <b>local</b> <b>light</b> sources at each receiver point on the height-field • Incident Radiance: A method to compute the unshadowed incident radiance from spherical <b>local</b> <b>light</b> sources at each receiver point on the height-field Soft Shadows from <b>Local</b> <b>Lights</b> To shade a receiver point we need to integrate the product of three functions over the hemisphere around the receiver point: the visibility function, the BRDF and the incident radiance, each represented in the Spherica...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{framework}} to estimate detailed shape of diffuse objects with uniform albedo {{from a single}} RGB-D image. To estimate accurate lighting in natural illumination environment, we introduce a general lighting model consist-ing of two components: global and local models. The global lighting model is estimated from the RGB-D input using the low-dimensional characteristic of a diffuse reflectance model. The <b>local</b> <b>lighting</b> model represents spatially vary-ing illumination and it is estimated by using the smoothly-varying characteristic of illumination. With both the global and <b>local</b> <b>lighting</b> model, we can estimate complex light-ing variations in uncontrolled natural illumination condi-tions accurately. For high quality shape capture, a shape-from-shading approach is applied with the estimated light-ing model. Since the entire process is done with a single RGB-D input, our method is capable of capturing the high quality shape details of a dynamic object under natural illu-mination. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our method that dramatically improves shape details of the rough depth input. 1...|$|E
