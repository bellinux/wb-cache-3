5|$|Madonna looks both {{older and}} younger than she does in the photos and the videos: a little more lined and {{possibly}} tired, but also less mature and grand. Her manner is quite teenaged, not femme fatale. She seems up for mischief, and yet quite conscious of her power. At the same time, her very frankness is almost innocent. These combinations are odd, and they give her {{the air of a}} prematurely wise child. Her current style is 1930s Hollywood meets early 1970s flash: Jean Harlow and Angie Bowie. She is not bewitching, but is certainly beautiful. She wears the nose stud that so troubled Norman Mailer in a recent interview. If you saw her in the street, you'd think: she looks like a girl who <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> bit like Madonna.|$|E
5|$|While in {{town with}} the Mistress, Lad saves her from {{an attack by}} a sick dog being chased {{by the police and}} other citizens, who believe it to be rabid. The dog is shot and the upset Mistress, who knew it was not really rabid, goes home. The next day, the town constable comes by boat to the Place to execute Lad under the notion that he is now rabid. The Master argues that the other dog was not rabid and refuses to allow Lad to be shot, {{ordering}} the officer off his property. As the man is leaving, his boat overturns. Unable to swim, he is in danger of drowning until Lad jumps in and brings him back to shore. The grateful officer states that he killed the dog he came to kill and Lad only <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> little like him.|$|E

25|$|The 200 to 350foot (60 to 105m) thick Brushy Basin Member is {{composed}} of claystone, mudstone, and siltstone with small amounts of conglomerate and sandstone. Clays in this member are rich in smectite and thus tend to swell when wet and dry to a crumbled surface that <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> bit like popcorn. Fossilized dinosaur bones are abundant in this member in several places located in Utah and western Colorado. The bones are usually scattered and are thus hard to identify but nearly complete skeletons {{have been found in}} lake floor and flood-plain clays. Good exposures of the Brushy Basin Member {{can be seen in the}} Bentonite Hills.|$|E
25|$|On {{hatching}} larvae have a whitish/grey C-shaped segmented body, with {{a darker}} coloured head and dark brown jaws (mandibles). The larvae have {{three pairs of}} legs (true legs) attached to {{the underside of the}} segment behind the head, called the thorax. The length of the larvae ranges from 5mm, when newly hatched, to 25mm at larval maturity. Newly hatched larvae weigh 2–3mg and grow up to 200mg. The most obvious characteristic of larva is that the abdomen is very swollen and <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> lot bigger than any other part of body. There are many thin fine hairs along both sides of the body, especially around the abdomen. Occasionally grass grub larvae can be found that are purple/yellow or green in colour, these are diseased.|$|E
25|$|After Hazumu's {{transformation}} into a girl, Asuta suddenly finds {{his good friend}} Hazumu very attractive, and cannot help himself when he starts thinking about Hazumu in a sexual way. During the time when Hazumu and her friends go to the beach, Asuta continuously tries to remind himself that even though Hazumu's body has changed, the person is still the same, and as her best friend, {{he should not be}} thinking about her in a sexual way. Hazumu remains oblivious to the fact throughout the series that Asuta has been often thinking about her in a sexual way. Asuta continues to have fantasies about having Hazumu as a girlfriend as well. Overtime, Asuta realizes that Hazumu and him gradually grow apart from each other, or are at least not as close as they once had been when Hazumu was a boy. He does find it excellent that his friend is now a very attractive girl, but only wants to continue being Hazumu's friend and nothing more, constantly beating himself up for having impure thoughts about Hazumu. In the last pages of the manga, he announces to the others that he has found a girlfriend, and shows them a photograph of her. They remark that she <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> lot like Hazumu.|$|E

500|$|In 1998, Tomlinson was {{described}} as possessing [...] "the air of slight arrogance that goes with good <b>looks,</b> <b>a</b> hard-trained body and a sharp intellect". The Geneva press {{reported that he had}} a [...] "perfect command of [...] French [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Others {{argue that}} [...] "Nancy, despite her {{traditionally}} feminine attributes, such as good <b>looks,</b> <b>a</b> variety of clothes for all social occasions, and {{an awareness of}} good housekeeping, is often praised for her seemingly masculine traits... she operates best independently, has the freedom and money to do as she pleases, and outside of a telephone call or two home, seems to live for solving mysteries rather than participating in family life." ...|$|E

500|$|Four Swords Adventures also {{received}} criticism. Game Revolution {{said about the}} game, [...] "Graphically, Four Swords Adventures is an odd mix of cheap 2D SNES sprites and nice Gamecube particle effects. It <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> lot like the GBA game, but now wears fancier pants and shows off upgraded visual flourishes, like Wind Waker style curly-Q air poofs. Still, much of the technology has clearly been ported over from the GBA, creating an inconsistent feel." [...] They also criticized the requirement of the link cable, saying that [...] "the required use of the GBA for multiplayer does limit the play potential." ...|$|E
500|$|However, Roger Ebert {{argued the}} film was a [...] "glum, lackluster movie in which even the big effects {{sequences}} seem dutiful instead of exhilarating." [...] He also felt that [...] "Brandon Routh lacks charisma as Superman", surmising that he [...] "may have been cast because he <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> little like Reeve". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle felt that Warner Bros. should have rebooted the series {{along the lines of}} Batman Begins. He also felt Bosworth, at 22 years old, was too young to portray Lois Lane, and the climax did not [...] "match the potential of the tiring 154-minute-long film".|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Cumberbatch {{provided}} {{the voice and}} motion-capture for both Smaug the Dragon and the Necromancer in , the first instalment of The Hobbit film series {{based on the novel}} by J. R. R. Tolkien. He reprised his roles as Smaug and the Necromancer for [...] (2013) and [...] (2014). For the motion-capture aspect of the films, he used a suit and facial markers to highlight the dragon's expressions and movements. Cumberbatch told Total Film [...] "You just have to lose your shit on a carpeted floor, in a place that <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> little bit like a mundane government building. It was just me as well, with four static cameras and all the sensors." ...|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, {{the film}} {{received}} generally positive reviews. Dilys Powell of The Sunday Times remarked {{after seeing the}} film that [...] "The cinema was a duller place before 007." [...] David Robinson of The Financial Times criticised the appearance of Connery and his effectiveness to play Bond in the film, remarking: [...] "It's not just that Sean Connery <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> lot more haggard and less heroic than he did {{two or three years}} ago, but there is much less effort to establish him as connoisseur playboy. Apart from the off-handed order for Beluga, there is little of that comic display of bon viveur-manship {{that was one of the}} charms of Connery's almost-a-gentleman 007." ...|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{following}} the March 2010 {{passage of the}} Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Romney attacked the landmark legislation as [...] "an unconscionable abuse of power" [...] and said the act should be repealed. The antipathy Republicans felt for it created a potential problem for the former governor, since the new federal law {{was in many ways}} similar to the Massachusetts health care reform passed during Romney's gubernatorial tenure; as one Associated Press article stated, [...] "Obamacare... <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> lot like Romneycare." [...] While acknowledging that his plan was an imperfect work in progress, Romney did not back away from it. He defended the state-level health insurance mandate that underpinned it, calling the bill the right answer to Massachusetts' problems at the time.|$|E
500|$|The book's {{endpapers}} {{had been}} overlooked. Potter {{wrote to the}} firm: [...] "I conclude {{there is no time}} to get an end-paper design done—unless Mr. Stokoe has already designed one—I do not mind one way or another; I had begun to scribble something but it <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> bit stiff." [...] Mr. Stokoe apparently did not design one because the endpapers were either plain white or mottled lavender. Several years later, they were replaced with a design featuring a pie and a patty-pan and the cover illustration changed to Ribby sitting by the fire. In the 1930s, the book's size was reduced to bring it into line {{with the rest of the}} Peter Rabbit books. The title was changed at that time to The Tale of the Pie and the Patty-Pan.|$|E

500|$|The {{technological}} advances {{incorporated into the}} Harrier II, compared with the original Harrier, significantly reduce the workload on the pilot. The supercritical wing, hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) control principle, and increased engineered [...] stability make the aircraft fundamentally easier to fly. Ed Harper, general manager for the McDonnell Douglas Harrier II development program, summarized: [...] "The AV-8B <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> lot like the original Harrier and it uses the same operating fundamentals. It just uses them a lot better". A large cathode-ray tube multi-purpose display, taken from the F/A-18, makes up much of the instrument panel in the cockpit. It has {{a wide range of}} functions, including radar warning information and weapon delivery checklist. The pilots sit on UPC/Stencel 10B zero-zero ejection seats, meaning that they are able to eject from a stationary aircraft at zero altitude.|$|E
500|$|Zoe Detsi-Diamanti, in {{her book}} The Flesh Made Text Made Flesh, commented on the episode's {{depiction}} of race. She argues that the episode {{makes the point that}} a [...] "perfectly normal" [...] black man <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> certain way, pointing out that the episode states that a black man is defined by a [...] "certain skin pigment". Any exception to this norm is depicted in a negative manner, with science being the only answer to unnatural phenomena. Dean Kowalski agreed with the analysis in The Philosophy of The X-Files, commenting that one of the main themes of the episodes revolved around science's attempt to explain folk theories and paranormal phenomena. The episode's antagonist Aboah, escapes the FBI by fitting into a dinner cart, a feat that was compared to slaves escaping in unconformable slave ships.|$|E
500|$|Distancing {{the film}} from what {{producer}} Preston Stutzman called the [...] "candy-coated, brightly colored pastel world" [...] of other CG animated films, an {{attempt was made}} to bring an organic look to the film, and dirt was rubbed into the colors. The Nightmare Before Christmas was cited as an inspiration for the filmmakers to try to bend the characters' shapes into extremes, and many other choices unconventional to computer-animated films were also made. For example, one of the Woodsman's eyes was made bigger than the other, and Red was given only four fingers, so as to make her look more like a doll. Producer Katie Hooten explained that [...] "CG in the past has been pushing the envelope to make things look more realistic, but Hoodwinked takes things back to where CG <b>looks</b> <b>a</b> lot more like a cartoon." ...|$|E
