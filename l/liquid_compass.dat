50|$|Despite these advances, the <b>liquid</b> <b>compass</b> was not {{introduced}} generally {{into the}} Royal Navy until 1908. An early version developed by RN Captain Creak {{proved to be}} operational under heavy gunfire and seas, but was felt to lack navigational precision compared with the design by Lord Kelvin. However, with ship and gun sizes continuously increasing, {{the advantages of the}} <b>liquid</b> <b>compass</b> over the Kelvin compass became unavoidably apparent to the Admiralty, and after widespread adoption by other navies, the <b>liquid</b> <b>compass</b> was generally adopted by the Royal Navy.|$|E
5000|$|On April 10, 1933 Tuomas Vohlonen {{applied for}} a patent for a <b>liquid</b> <b>compass,</b> with the {{description}} [...] "liquid compass with compass needle and liquid entirely sealed in a container made of celluloid". On September 3, 1934 Vohlonen supplemented the application with edited patent demands: 1: Method of manufacturing a <b>liquid</b> <b>compass,</b> in which the liquid chamber is manufactured {{of two or more}} pieces and jointed by gluing or soldering, to form a sealed chamber, 2: Liquid is pressed into chamber through a small hole, which is then sealed with glue or soldering and 3: <b>Liquid</b> <b>compass</b> built under conditions 1 and 2, and 4: the needle chamber is made entirely of celluloid or other substance like it. Now the application included the fabrication method. On September 11, 1934 Vohlonen made another supplement, which included the same as the previous, only rephrased. On January 25, 1935 Vohlonen was granted a patent number 16285 for a method of manufacturing a <b>liquid</b> <b>compass</b> and a <b>liquid</b> <b>compass</b> manufactured accordingly. The patent was effective from the date of first application, April 10, 1933.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} Roadblock, one racer from each team started {{at one of}} four {{landmarks}} on the beach (an anchor, a set of barrels, a ship's bell, and a ship's wheel) and by using a traditional <b>liquid</b> <b>compass</b> (in which the direction they are facing faces them on the compass), a shovel with a marking indicating 1 yd, and {{a unique set of}} directions, they had to search the beach for a treasure chest buried in the sand that held their next clue.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Liquid</b> <b>compasses</b> were next {{adapted for}} aircraft. In 1909, Captain F.O. Creagh-Osborne, Superintendent of Compasses at the Admiralty, {{introduced}} his Creagh-Osborne aircraft compass, which used {{a mixture of}} alcohol and distilled water to damp the compass card. [...] After {{the success of this}} invention, Capt. Creagh-Osborne adapted his design to a much smaller pocket model for individual use by officers of artillery or infantry, receiving a patent in 1915.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, Suunto {{introduced}} a compact <b>liquid</b> sighting <b>compass,</b> the M/40, for artillery officers and other users needing a precision instrument for measuring an azimuth. The company grew rapidly after the war, supplying compasses and other navigational instruments to both {{civilian and military}} markets.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{compasses}} usually use a magnetized needle or dial {{inside a}} capsule completely {{filled with a}} liquid (lamp oil, mineral oil, white spirits, purified kerosene, or ethyl alcohol is common). While older designs commonly incorporated a flexible rubber diaphragm or airspace inside the capsule to allow for volume changes caused by temperature or altitude, some modern <b>liquid</b> <b>compasses</b> utilize smaller housings and/or flexible capsule materials to accomplish the same result. The liquid inside the capsule serves to damp {{the movement of the}} needle, reducing oscillation time and increasing stability. Key points on the compass, including {{the north end of the}} needle are often marked with phosphorescent, photoluminescent, or self-luminous materials to enable the compass to be read at night or in poor light. As the <b>compass</b> fill <b>liquid</b> is noncompressible under pressure, many ordinary liquid-filled compasses will operate accurately underwater to considerable depths.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>liquid</b> <b>compass</b> is {{a design}} {{in which the}} {{magnetized}} needle or card is damped by fluid to protect against excessive swing or wobble, improving readability while reducing wear. A rudimentary working model of a <b>liquid</b> <b>compass</b> was introduced by Sir Edmund Halley {{at a meeting of}} the Royal Society in 1690. [...] However, as early liquid compasses were fairly cumbersome and heavy, and subject to damage, their main advantage was aboard ship. Protected in a binnacle and normally gimbal-mounted, the liquid inside the compass housing effectively damped shock and vibration, while eliminating excessive swing and grounding of the card caused by the pitch and roll of the vessel. The first liquid mariner's compass believed practicable for limited use was patented by the Englishman Francis Crow in 1813. [...] Liquid-damped marine compasses for ships and small boats were occasionally used by the Royal Navy from the 1830s through 1860, but the standard Admiralty compass remained a dry-mount type. [...] In the latter year, the American physicist and inventor Edward Samuel Ritchie patented a greatly improved liquid marine compass that was adopted in revised form for general use by the United States Navy, and later purchased by the Royal Navy as well.|$|E
50|$|In 1965, a British sport diver {{noticed that}} Suunto’s <b>liquid</b> filled <b>compass</b> also worked underwater. Following this revelation, it didn’t take long before Suunto’s first dive compass, SK-4 (=SukellusKompassi, engl. diving compass) was {{launched}} and became {{well known for}} its durability and reliability. Among the users were explorers, ecologists and famous sea-dwellers like Jacques Cousteau.During the 1980s, Suunto became {{a leader in the}} manufacturing of diving instruments. Having previously produced mechanical instruments, Suunto now started the production of electronic diving computers and launched the SME in 1987. This was Suunto’s most significant innovation of the decade and a major influence on scuba diving’s transition to a popular sport.|$|R
5000|$|In November 1932 a Swedish company Nya Instrumentfabriks Aktiebolaget Lyth {{had applied}} for a patent also in Finland for [...] "vätskekompass", a <b>liquid</b> filled <b>compass.</b> In the {{application}} the needle chamber was described as being built of two different materials, of which only the upper part was made of flexible material. Nothing was mentioned about method of fabrication. This caused a threat and delay for accepting Vohlonen's patent. However, these applications were {{not considered to be}} about the same kind of product, so both Vohlonen and Lyth were granted a patent. This {{is one of the reasons}} why Vohlonen had to supplement his application: he knew the original formulation wouldn't succeed.|$|R
40|$|The {{training}} ship NANSEI MARU (44. 56 gross tonnage) is a wooden vessel, built in March 1967. In December 1972 the author had the ship fitted {{out with a}} Bilge keel (11. 00 m× 250 mm× 150 mm) and investigated into {{the effects of this}} Bilge keel on the maneuverability of the ship. The measurement was carried out through Z-maneuverability tests and turning trials to compare the maneuverability of the ship after fixing the Bilge keel with that before fixing. And the following results are obtained: 1) The results of Z-maneuvering tests show that the maneuverability index K’ after fixing the Bilge keel to the ship increases 10 ~ 20 % and that the index T’ increases 50 ~ 100 % in case of small rudder angle and 10 ~ 40 % in case of large angle, decreases, however, 0 ~ 20 % in case of rudder angle 15 °: that is to say that the turning quality gets better, the following quality becomes, on the contrary, worse (except the case of rudder angle 15 °). 2) The results of turning trials show the same tendencies as those of Z-maneuvering tests that max. advance after fitting the Bilge keel becomes longer and max. transfer gets shorter. 3) The author would {{like to point out that}} there would be cases where the maneuverability of ships equipped with a <b>liquid</b> magnetic <b>compass</b> could not exactly measured, because, when a small ship sails with a high speed and turns with a large angle, the turning angular velocity becomes large and therefore the waked angle becomes too large for a <b>liquid</b> magnetic <b>compass</b> to mark the real of following. ...|$|R
25|$|At Lindbergh's request, {{the large}} main and forward fuel tanks {{were placed in}} the forward section of the fuselage, in front of the pilot, with the oil tank acting as a firewall. This {{arrangement}} improved the center of gravity and reduced the risk of the pilot being crushed to death between the main tank and the engine {{in the event of a}} crash. This design decision meant that there could be no front windshield, and that forward visibility would be limited to the side windows. This did not concern Lindbergh as he was used to flying in the rear cockpit of mail planes with mail bags in the front. When he wanted to see forward, he would slightly yaw the aircraft and look out the side. To provide some forward vision as a precaution against hitting ship masts, trees, or structures while flying at low altitude, a Ryan employee who had served in the submarine service installed a periscope which Lindbergh helped design. It is unclear whether the periscope was used during the flight. The instrument panel housed fuel pressure, oil pressure and temperature gauges, a clock, altimeter, tachometer, airspeed indicator, bank and turn indicator, and a <b>liquid</b> magnetic <b>compass.</b> The main compass was mounted behind Lindbergh in the cockpit, and he read it using the mirror from a women's makeup case which was mounted to the ceiling using chewing gum. Lindbergh also installed a newly developed Earth Inductor Compass made by the Pioneer Instrument Company which allowed him to more accurately navigate while taking account of the magnetic declination of the earth. Lindbergh's ultimate arrival in Ireland deviated from his flight plan by just a few miles.|$|R
