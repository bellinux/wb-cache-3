The aim of this thesis is a detailed analysis of the concept of abnormally <b>low</b> <b>tender</b> price {{with regard to}} the case law of administrative courts and the Office for the Protection of Competition. The analysis is made both in relation to the Public Procurement act and the EU Directive on public procurement. After an introductory part the thesis is divided into seven main chapters. The first chapter outlines basic terms necessary for comprehensive analysis of further discussed issues. Chapter two deals with the concept of abnormally <b>low</b> <b>tender</b> price including its evolution in the former public procurement law. The third chapter focuses on the process of assessment of the tenders concerning the abnormally <b>low</b> <b>tender</b> price. This chapter deals with the request for explanation of the tenderer's tender price, with requirements of this explanation and with assessment of this explanation made by evaluation committee. Chapter four examines the zero tender price and the case law of administrative courts regarding the correct procedure in case of occurrence of this price. This chapter takes [...] ...|$|R

50|$|A {{portion of}} land was {{set aside for}} a new Post Office {{on the corner of}} Duke and Channon Streets on what was then known as Commissioner's Hill. Due to its {{remoteness}} from the centre of the town, this location received strong protest from the residents of Gympie and a petition of five hundred signatures was sent to the Minister of Works. However, this was ignored by the Government and the erection of the new Post Office proceeded on the reserved site. Tenders for the new building were called on May 9, 1878 and two were received. Both were beyond the expected cost and negotiations were made with the <b>lowest</b> <b>tenderer,</b> Andrew Collins. This included the reduction of the length of the building from 96 feet to 76 feet.

40|$|In the UK power system, {{there is}} {{currently}} no battery energy storage system (BESS) for providing grid-scale frequency response. However, according to the UK future energy plan, with a high penetration of renewable energy sources, battery technologies have become increasingly attractive to provide firm frequency response (FFR). This paper estimates the current and future balancing requirement of National Grid UK. A methodology for the economic optimization of the parameters of LiFePO 4 BESSs is proposed to achieve the <b>lowest</b> <b>tender</b> price in the UK FFR market. The economic analysis is performed based on the estimated battery lifetime and the UK frequency regulation market. Results {{suggest that it is}} profitable to deploy BESSs in the UK market. The <b>lowest</b> <b>tender</b> price obtained was £ 17. 4012 /MW/h, which is already lower than many successfully tendered prices from FFR providers.

The research will identify the criteria used to evaluate the degree of heterogeneity of the requirements. The result of this research will be a developed model for the Contracting Officer (CO) or Program Officer (PO) to use in evaluating the heterogeneous degree of requirement. Then, based on the result of the model, the PO and CO will know which is an appropriate basis for contract award.

5000|$|For instance, {{a bill of}} {{quantities}} {{is a list of}} all {{the materials}} (and other work such as amount of excavation) of a project which have sufficient detail to obtain a realistic cost, or rate per described item of work/material. The tenders should not only show the unit cost per material/work, but should also if possible, break it down to labour, plant and material costs. In this way the individual who is selecting the tender will be quite confident that the tender is feasible. Bids are not only chosen on cost alone. Sometimes contractors submit lower tenders to win the contract and win the work. Either the costs that the contractor incurs are greater than the price he is charging the client (as a consequence of a lower tender determining the contract sum), and thus is likely to go insolvent, or he will claim for [...] "loss and/or expense" [...] due to discrepancies in the contract documents (this can be done deliberately). The <b>lowest</b> <b>tender</b> is not always a feasible <b>tender.</b> The <b>lowest</b> <b>tender</b> is the most likely to increase the contract sum the most throughout the course of the project.|$|R

40|$|Theme 1 Fjord {{crossings}} by ferries {{are vital}} in the Norwegian trunk road system. The ferries are operated by ferry companies, each ferry company being a monopolist on {{a bundle of}} crossings. The government regulates prices and service frequencies and awards subsidies to the companies {{in order to make}} the ferry services economically viable. Tendering has been suggested as a means to induce cost efficiency and thus reduce costly subsidies. In order to gain experience with tendering on this area, this regime has recently been introduced on a few selected crossings. We argue that this small-scale experiment may not reveal the cost savings that may be obtained by a large-scale experiment. This is due to a ratchet effect: The incumbent ferry companies may not have the incentives to submit <b>low</b> <b>tenders</b> as by doing so, the ferry companies reveals that there is much to gain for the government by carrying through a large-scale tender competition in the future. Such a large-scale tender competition may be harmful to the companies as compared to status quo. Realising this, each company may be reluctant to submit <b>low</b> <b>tenders</b> in the competition for the selected tender crossings. Institute of Transport and Logistics Studies.

40|$|The growing {{importance}} of the maintenance industry renews the interest of both practioners and academia working in the maintenance field. In the past or even now, most of the maintenance work contractors are selected purely on basis of the <b>lowest</b> <b>tender</b> prices, {{even though they are}} required to be undergone the pre-qualification process. However, it is increasingly admitted that the practice of awarding tenders on a basis of <b>low</b> <b>tender</b> price eventually would lead to the ultimate quality problems. In consequence, there is a serious outcry in the public sector demanding a revolution in the current tender awarding system. Accordingly, this study intends to test how different managers actually choose maintenance contractors. This in turn would lead us to focus on the identification of the major selection attributes, and the trade-off weightings among attributes during the selection process. In this study, the identification and the trade-off weightings for different contractors selection attributes are revealed by conjoint analysis. Meanwhile, a Likert scale rating is also used to reveal whether there are disparities between the relative perceived importance and the relative weights in actual selection in the contractors selection attributes. Our results found that there are some consistencies in the relative perceived importance and the relative weights in actual contractor selection. On the other hand, our results also reveal that the contractors should put more effort in improving their company reputation in order to win the maintenance contracts.
