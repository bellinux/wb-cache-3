5|$|At the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos <b>Laboratory,</b> <b>research</b> into {{implosion}} {{had been}} proceeding under Seth Neddermeyer, but his division {{had worked with}} cylinders and small charges, and had only produced objects that looked like rocks. Their research was accorded a low priority, owing to expectations that a gun-type nuclear weapon design would work for both uranium-235 and plutonium, and implosion technology would not be required.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, Rhoads was {{selected}} as director of Memorial Hospital, which was devoted to cancer care and research, and had recently {{moved into a new}} building. Rhoads {{was selected}} for his interest in clinical investigation in addition to <b>laboratory</b> <b>research,</b> as the hospital did research as well as treatment. He succeeded James Ewing, a noted oncologist. Ewing had written about cancer transplantation in 1931, a subject which Rhoads had referred to in his scandalous letter written in November of that year. In 1941 Rhoads was studying the use of radiation to treat leukemia.|$|E

5|$|Chemical vapor {{deposition}} is {{a method}} by which diamond can be grown from a hydrocarbon gas mixture. Since the early 1980s, this method {{has been the subject}} of intensive worldwide research. Whereas the mass-production of high-quality diamond crystals make the HPHT process the more suitable choice for industrial applications, the flexibility and simplicity of CVD setups explain the popularity of CVD growth in <b>laboratory</b> <b>research.</b> The advantages of CVD diamond growth include the ability to grow diamond over large areas and on various substrates, and the fine control over the chemical impurities and thus properties of the diamond produced. Unlike HPHT, CVD process does not require high pressures, as the growth typically occurs at pressures under 27 kPa.|$|E
5|$|Non-genetic, environmental, post-infectious, or psychosocial factors—while not causing Tourette's—can {{influence}} its severity. Autoimmune processes {{may affect}} tic onset and exacerbation in some cases. In 1998, a {{team at the}} US National Institute of Mental Health proposed a hypothesis based on observation of 50 children that both obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and tic disorders may arise in a subset of children {{as a result of}} a poststreptococcal autoimmune process. Children who meet five diagnostic criteria are classified, according to the hypothesis, as having Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections (PANDAS). This contentious hypothesis is the focus of clinical and <b>laboratory</b> <b>research,</b> but remains unproven.|$|E
5|$|He {{then did}} a ten-month {{residency}} at Melbourne Hospital to gain experience {{before going into}} practice. The new graduates spent four months in the medicine ward, another four in surgery, and the remaining two in casualty. In the surgery ward he worked under John Gordon and Alan Newton, both well known surgeons. He enjoyed this period immensely and was disappointed {{when he had to}} do his medicine residency. However, he was soon engrossed in his work, having been inspired by the neurologist Richard Stawell, whom Burnet came to idolise. As a result of this he became intent on a career in clinical neurology, and he wrote a theoretical paper about testing sensory losses following peripheral nerve lesions, but his submission to the Clinical Report of the Melbourne Hospital was rejected. Burnet applied to be medical registrar as part of his clinical career path, but the medical superintendent of Melbourne Hospital, {{who was in charge of}} such appointments, deemed Burnet's character and personality more suited to a <b>laboratory</b> <b>research</b> career, and asked Burnet to withdraw his application in return for the post of senior resident pathologist, which would become vacant in the following months. Burnet complied.|$|E
