5|$|Furthermore, {{the appeal}} did not engage foreign policy considerations. The treaty was a civil {{convention}} between two countries and {{an agreement to}} render mutual judicial assistance, and {{had nothing to do}} with foreign affairs other than that it was made between state parties. It also did not involve the policing of government conduct in international affairs, because it only implicated the procedures private litigants had to take to serve writs on defendants residing in Hong Kong. When interpreting the treaty, the Court only had to determine the domestic <b>legal</b> <b>obligations</b> of the respondents seeking to serve a writ out of jurisdiction. Thus, the issue of whether the treaty applied to Hong Kong was justiciable, and the Ministry's letter was not decisive on the matter.|$|E

The situation in which a civil servant finds out that a colleague has been or is being bribed by a construction company {{is a good example}} of a form of civil service crime to which the <b>legal</b> <b>obligation</b> to report applies. This <b>legal</b> <b>obligation</b> to report results from Article 162 of the Penal Code. Partly because of parliamentary questions about this <b>legal</b> <b>obligation</b> to report, the need has arisen to gain insight into the value of this leg-islative article and to explore whether the present form of the <b>legal</b> <b>obligation</b> to report is satisfactory. Moreover, since the Dutch Cabinet has indicated its intention to pro-mote attention for recognizing, signalling and reporting corruption, the Dutch Scientific Research and Documentation Centre of the Ministry of Justice has commissioned Beke Consultancy and Research to conduct a study into the way the civil servants’ <b>legal</b> <b>obligation</b> to report functions...|$|R

25|$|Soon, {{the only}} things keeping most {{passenger}} trains running were <b>legal</b> <b>obligations.</b> Meanwhile, companies {{who were interested in}} using railroads for profitable freight traffic were looking for ways to get out of those <b>legal</b> <b>obligations,</b> and it looked like intercity passenger rail service would soon become extinct in the United States beyond a few highly populated corridors. The final blow for passenger trains in the U.S. came with the loss of railroad post offices in the 1960s. On May 1, 1971, the federally funded Amtrak took over (with a few exceptions) all intercity passenger rail service in the continental United States. The Rio Grande, with its Denver-Ogden Rio Grande Zephyr and the Southern with its Washington, D.C.–New Orleans Southern Crescent chose to stay out of Amtrak, and the Rock Island, with two intrastate Illinois trains, was too far gone to be included into Amtrak.|$|E

25|$|To {{meet its}} objectives, the FinTRACA {{collects}} and analyzes {{information from a}} variety of sources.

Also, FinTRACA has access to all related Afghan government information and databases. When the analysis of this information supports the supposition of illegal use of the financial system, the FinTRACA works closely with law enforcement to investigate and prosecute the illegal activity. FinTRACA also cooperates internationally in support of its own analyses and investigations and to support the analyses and investigations of foreign counterparts, to the extent allowed by law. Other functions include training of those entities with <b>legal</b> <b>obligations</b> to report information, development of laws and regulations to support national-level AML objectives, and international and regional cooperation in the development of AML typologies and countermeasures.|$|E

25|$|The main remedy against {{tortious}} loss is compensation {{in damages}} or money. In a {{limited range of}} cases, tort law will tolerate self-help, such as reasonable force to expel a trespasser. This is a defense against the tort of battery. Further, {{in the case of}} a continuing tort, or even where harm is merely threatened, the courts will sometimes grant an injunction, such as in the English case Miller v Jackson (1977). This means a command, for something other than money by the court, such as restraining the continuance or threat of harm. Usually injunctions will not impose positive obligations on tortfeasors, but some Australian jurisdictions can make an order for specific performance to ensure that the defendant carries out their <b>legal</b> <b>obligations,</b> especially in relation to nuisance matters.|$|E
