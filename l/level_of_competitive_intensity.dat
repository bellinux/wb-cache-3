Our study shows that customer and supplier collaborations have both bright and dark sides, and their benefits with respect to helping a PSF to drive service performance are contingent on the levels of the environmental competition and turbulence. In particular, we show that increasing levels of competitive intensity and environmental turbulence encountered by a PSF can diminish the capacity of customer and supplier collaborations to drive service performance. When the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>competitive</b> <b>intensity</b> increases, the benefits of customer collaboration become more positive; however, the dark-side of supplier collaboration becomes more pronounced, which negatively influences service performance. When the level of environmental turbulence increases, the dark-side of customer and supplier collaborations becomes more critical and the benefits derived from interfirm collaboration to promote service performance can be lost. 9 page(s...|$|E

Drawing on quality management literature, organizational resilience literature, and the theory of dynamic capabilities in the strategy literature, this study empirically investigates the effects of four capabilities that help sustain highâ quality performance. The analysis shows that capabilities in improvement, innovation, sensing weak signals, and responsiveness all help sustain highâ quality performance. This suggests that what it takes to achieve highâ quality performance is different, in part, from what it takes to sustain it. The data comes from a survey of 147 manufacturing business units.

We seek to fill this gap by considering a durable goods manufacturer that uses independent dealers to get her product to consumers. In contrast to much of the literature, we specifically consider the possibility that if the manufacturer sells her product, then the dealers can either sell or lease it to the final consumer. One of our more interesting findings is that, when the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> competition among dealers is high, the manufacturer prefers to use a lease-brokering arrangement in which the dealers earn a margin for brokering leases between the manufacturer and end consumers, instead of selling her product to the dealers.

40|$|What are the {{critical}} capabilities that {{middle and upper}} level managers in retail agribusiness firms need to lead their firms successfully in the future? This is the central question of this study. ^ A survey of CEO 2 ̆ 7 s in large retail agribusiness firms examines their perceptions of {{the critical}} drivers of change and key success factors in their competitive environment for their firms. Then, given these environmental changes these same CEO 2 ̆ 7 s are asked to identify the critical skills and behaviors that managers within their businesses will need to exhibit to allow the firm to compete effectively in the new environment. Individuals maintaining a leadership role at their firm or cooperative can use this information to craft strategies going forward, which may be more suitable to the imminent turbulent events that are characteristic of the agricultural industry. By identifying the critical skills and behaviors, the leaders will also be able to formulate succession plans or develop employees who can lead their organization successfully. ^ Since firms in the agricultural industry are constantly subjected to changes in environment, future leaders need to continue developing their skills and competencies to minimize any potential skill gaps, especially those related to results, thought, personal, people leadership. This study seeks to identify what the important key driving and success factors are. The data indicate that industry leaders have a high degree of agreement on the most important external and internal influences of success for their industry. The study also tested the hypothesis that employees in a firm, years of experience of a leader, average annual sales, and <b>competitive</b> <b>intensity</b> having a statistically significant impact on the firm 2 ̆ 7 s perception of external influences, internal influences, and leadership areas. The statistically significant results of this analysis suggest that in competitive environments that are anticipating intense rivalry for key dimensions of competition in the future, leadership development needs to be centered on specific leadership areas. In most cases, rising <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>competitive</b> <b>intensity</b> can result in a shift in leadership needs and individuals who have adept abilities in key leadership skills and competencies will be able to respond better to changes in market conditions. The study also tested the hypothesis that the perceptions of the CEO 2 ̆ 7 s on external and internal influences can dictate how important leadership skills are; results show that there are no statistically significant marginal effects. The reason that could be behind this that there is little variation identified surrounding many of the measured influences in the industry forcing the multinomial logit analysis, which intends to exploit variation, to produce statistically insignificant results. ^ The findings send signals to current and future leaders in the crop input retail industry. Each leadership area has subcomponents that can help guide current strategists and future leaders in their attempt to navigate their organization through an amorphous industry that is characteristic throughout the agricultural sector. Under the many different circumstances which can arise in this industry, specific leadership development actions can be taken to ensure the success of their organization {{as it relates to the}} leadership skills and competencies. By anticipating what is in the future for the crop input retail industry, plans can be made to nurture or equip employees with the necessary capabilities using the many frameworks have been introduced by numerous authors. Finding a matching framework for a firm may be a matter of preference. This study operates under the Sveiby 2 ̆ 7 s framework of intangible assets which focuses on three components: the external structures, internal structures, and employee competencies. Other frameworks differ by creating a cyclical effect which recycles and spreads skills through sharing of information such as the framework proposed by Arthur Anderson and the American Productivity and Quality Center. With the knowledge management frameworks infused with the critical skills capabilities needed for the future, the leader of the firm or cooperative can navigate through the agricultural industry at a greater advantage than others who do not make this effort. ...|$|R

40|$|A long-running {{debate in}} sports {{economics}} has centred on whether labour market devices and revenue sharing rules {{are effective in}} increasing competitive balance in sports leagues comprised of either profit maximising clubs or win maximising clubs. This chapter examines the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>competitive</b> balance in a league comprised of win maximising clubs {{under a variety of}} labour market devices and revenue sharing rules and makes for interesting comparisons with competitive balance levels achieved in other professional sports leagues. Formed in 1897, the Australian Football League (AFL) has been comprised of clubs owned by their respective paid-up financial members. As a result of this ownership structure, rather than pursuing profits, analysis of the clubs' finances strongly suggests that they are win-maximisers, subject to breaking even. This chapter traces the history of labour market devices and revenue sharing rules the AFL has used to try to increase competitive balance among its win-maximising clubs. Seven different periods between 1897 and 2002 are identified and the different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>competitive</b> balance achieved matched against the devices used in each period.

The notion <b>of</b> <b>competitive</b> <b>intensity</b> itself has not been defined precisely. In this paper, we develop formal models of oligopolistic competition to investigate whether equilibrium <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> quality increase as competition intensifies. We consider three different competitive settings: (i) asymmetric duopolistic competition where the dominant firm's intrinsic demand potential decreases; (ii) a symmetric duopoly where the firms are precluded from cooperating in setting quality levels; and (iii) symmetric oligopolistic competition where the number of firms increases.
