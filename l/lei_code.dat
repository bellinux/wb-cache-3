25|$|The ISE is {{endorsed}} by the Regulatory Oversight Committee (ROC) and sponsored by the Central Bank of Ireland as a Local Operating Unit (LOU) for the processing of Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) services for Ireland. LEIs are codes designed to create a global reference data system that uniquely identifies every legal entity or structure, in any jurisdiction, that is party to a financial transaction. Businesses may apply for an <b>LEI</b> <b>code</b> through ISEdirect. LEIs were brought in by global regulators {{as part of the}} response to the global financial crisis.|$|E
50|$|The prefix {{portion of}} the UTI code should be a unique code for the code issueing authority. Ideally, the prefix would have reused the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) of the entity issueing the UTI. LEI codes are used across the {{financial}} reporting regimes in the U.S. (Dodd-Frank) and Europe (EMIR / MiFID). However, the <b>LEI</b> <b>code</b> length of 20 characters represented a problem for many systems, which in practice limited the usable prefix length to 10 characters. In June 2013, ISDA working groups suggested that the characters 7 through 16 of the 20 character global LEI number should {{be used as the}} UTI prefix. This would have led to clashes between UTIs generated for different organisations having the same characters 7 through 16 in their LEIs. Now the recommended best practice entails a 10 character UTI Prefix, algorithmically derived from an entity’s 20 character LEI using hash algorithms.|$|E

40|$|Salmonella typhimurium strain CV 123 (ara- 9 gal- 205 flrB 1), {{isolated}} as a mutant {{resistant to}} trifluoroleucine, has derepressed and constitutive levels of enzymes forming branched-chain amino acids. This strain grows {{more slowly than}} the parent at several temperatures, both in minimal medium and nutrient broth. It overproduces and excretes sizeable amounts of leucine, valine, and isoleucine {{in comparison with the}} parental strain. Both <b>leuS</b> (<b>coding</b> for leucyl-transfer ribonucleic acid [tRNA]synthetase) and flrB are linked to lip (min 20 to 25) by P 1 transduction, whereas only leuS is linked to lip by P 22 transduction. Strain CV 123 containing an F′ lip+ episome from Escherichia coli has repressed levels of leucine-forming enzymes, indicating that flrB+ is dominant to flrB. Leucyl-tRNA synthetase from strain CV 123 appears to be identical to the leucyl-tRNA synthetase in the parent. No differences were detected between strain CV 123 and the parent with respect to tRNA acceptor activity for a number of amino acids. Furthermore, there was no large difference between the two strains in the patterns of leucine tRNA isoaccepting species after fractionation on several different columns. Several other flrB strains exhibited temperature-sensitive excretion of leucine, i. e., they excreted leucine at 37 C but not 25 C. In one such strain, excretion at 37 C was correlated with derepression of some enzymes specified by ilv and leu. These latter results suggest that flrB codes for a protein...|$|R
5000|$|The leu (pronounced [...] ), plural: <b>lei</b> (...) ISO 4217 <b>code</b> RON; {{numeric code}} 946) is the {{currency}} of Romania. It is subdivided into 100 bani (singular: ban). On 1 July 2005, Romania underwent a currency reform, switching from the previous leu (ROL) to a new leu (RON). 1 RON is equal to 10,000 ROL. Romania joined the European Union on 1 January 2007 and initially hoped to adopt the euro in 2014, but with the deepening of the Euro crisis and with its own problems, such as a low workforce productivity, postponed its adoption plans indefinitely.|$|R
