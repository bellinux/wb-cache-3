5000|$|The {{lyrics of}} the [...] "March of the Volunteers", also {{formally}} {{known as the}} National Anthem of the People's Republic of China, were composed by Tian Han in 1934 as two stanzas in his poem [...] "The Great Wall" [...] (...) , intended either for a play {{he was working on}} at the time or as part of the script for Diantong's upcoming film Children of Troubled Times. The film is a story about a Chinese intellectual who flees during the Shanghai Incident to a life of luxury in Qingdao, only to be driven to fight the Japanese occupation of Manchuria after learning of the death of his friend. Urban legends later circulated that Tian wrote it in jail on rolling paper or the <b>liner</b> <b>paper</b> from cigarette boxes after being arrested in Shanghai by the Nationalists; in fact, he was arrested in Shanghai and held in Nanjing just after completing his draft for the film. During March and April 1935, In Japan, Nie Er set the words (with minor adjustments) to music; in May, Diantong's sound director He Luting had the Russian composer Aaron Avshalomov arrange their orchestral accompaniment, which is now often played separately as its instrumental arrangement. The song was performed by Gu Menghe and Yuan Muzhi, along with a small and [...] "hastily-assembled" [...] chorus; He Luting consciously chose to use their first take, which preserved the Cantonese accent of several of the men. On 9 May, Gu and Yuan recorded it in more standard Mandarin for Pathé Orient's Shanghai branch ahead of the movie's release, so that it served as a form of advertising for the film.|$|E
40|$|Although the Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) {{has been}} widely used in {{wastewater}} treatment, it reveals clogging problems and the removal efficiency of COD was as low as 70 % {{in the treatment of}} <b>liner</b> <b>paper</b> wastewater containing high concentrations of calcium ions. Calcium ions accumulated in the form of calcium carbonate and the ash content of granules reached 80 %, which lowered the specific methanogenic activity of granules to 25 % of the initial value. The pH was higher as the pH micro-electrode approached the core of the granule and this was why calcium carbonate was formed inside the granules. A novel process composed of UASB and CO 2 -stripper was suggested in this study to treat the <b>liner</b> <b>paper</b> wastewater. When the synthetic wastewater containing 5000 mg/l calcium hardness and 3000 mg/l COD was fed to the system, most of the calcium hardness was removed in the CO 2 -stripper and the removal efficiency of COD maintained a stable value of over 90 %. close 253...|$|E
40|$|An upflow {{anaerobic}} sluge blanket (UASB) reactor showed {{fairly good}} COD removal efficiency for the wastewater from a <b>liner</b> <b>paper</b> factory. Over 70 % of COD removal efficiency were obtained even at 18 g CODA day loading. A {{considerable amount of}} alkalinity was produced in the reactor when sulphate was reduced to hydrogen sulphide by sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB). Calcium was efficiently removed in CO 2 stripping unit where excess alkalinity was consumed to form calcium carbonate. No additional chemical such as caustic soda was necessary to facilitate the formation of calcium carbonate since the degassing of CO 2 increased the pH level in the CO 2 stripping unit. Calcium removal efficiency approached about 80 % {{and the level of}} effluent calcium ranged from 80 to 150 mg/l. Since this system (UASB + CO 2 stripping unit) used biologically produced alkalinity for the formation of calcium carbonate, it can be called a biosoftening process. Wastewater treatment using both an UASB reactor and a CO 2 stripping unit showed favourable properties for the papermaking process. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltdclose 131...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the use of}} delayed harvested reed canary-grass (Phalaris arundinacea) as a short fibre raw material for the pulp and paper industry. This study examines the following aspects of reed canary-grass: quality, transportation, storage, refining of the raw material by dry fractionation, chemical pulping, bleaching and paper production. The delayed harvesting method of reed canary-grass produces an economically and environmentally sustainable short fibre raw material for the pulp and paper industry. The ash content and fibre properties of reed canary-grass depend on soil type and growing location. The yearly variation in fibre yield and fibre properties is also considerable. There is, however, a potential for minimising quality variations by choosing reed canary-grass varieties suitable to a specific growing location. The leaf and leaf sheath content of reed canary-grass also affects {{the quality of the}} pulp. These quality variations can be eliminated by dry fractionation, a method that removes the unwanted parts of the grass. These unwanted parts {{can be used as a}} valuable bio-fuel raw material. Transport of reed canary grass after fractionation can be improved by briquetting, a method that doubles the transport capacity of reed canary-grass compared to that of birch logs on a fibre basis. High quality short fibre chemical pulp can be produced from reed canary-grass. The whole process from grass production to pulp production has been demonstrated successfully in full scale. Bleached reed canary-grass pulp can be used in products such as fine paper and white-top <b>liner</b> <b>paper...</b>|$|E

40|$|The paper {{industry}} needs to implement several concurrent strategies. In particular, the industry {{can be expected}} to view recycling as a central part of its activities. These activities will be focused on the intense demand of chemical and biochemical strategies to enhance bonding within paper and paperboard. Nowadays, on average, 55 % of fibrous compositions for papermaking are made of recycled fibers. In this field, about 65 - 70 % are fibrous compositions intended to be used for packaging papermaking. Corrugated cardboard {{is one of the most}} significant examples, since it is made of fluting (internal part) and test liner (external part). In test liner mills, fibrous compositions are made of 50 % paper cuts from the cardboard industry and the rest of other types of paper and cardboard. Some test <b>liner</b> <b>papers</b> have low content of mineral fillers. While recycling, fibers get damaged due to the hornification phenomena and mechanical refining of the pulp (with the purpose of enhancing the mechanical properties). The producer does not have many alternatives to address this situation: to increase the quality of the pulp, to slightly refine the pulp or to add some chemical additives that enhance mechanical properties. One strategy or alternative to this situation could be biorefining processes of the pulp. The present work aims to biorefine a pulp made of recycled fibers with the purpose of restoring the mechanical properties of the industrial test liner or improving them and making possible the addition of mineral fillers in order to decrease the production costs.

Vacuum plasma spray forming {{is of particular interest}} in the forming of CuCrNb alloys such as GRCop- 84, developed by NASA s Glenn Research Center, because the alloy cannot be formed using conventional casting and forging methods. This limitation is related to the levels of chromium and niobium in the alloy, which exceed the solubility limit in copper. Until recently, the only forming process that maintained the required microstructure of CrNb intermetallics was powder metallurgy formation of a billet from powder stock, followed by extrusion.

The research of bias flow liners has a fairly long history concerning both the parameter dependencies as well as the methods to model the acoustic behaviour of bias flow liners under the variety of different bias and grazing flow conditions. In order to establish an overview over the state of the art, this paper provides a comprehensive review about the published research on bias flow liners and modelling approaches with an extensive study of the most relevant parameters determining the acoustic behaviour of these <b>liners.</b> The <b>paper</b> starts with a historical description of available investigations aiming on the characterization of the bias flow absorption principle.

In a next step the fundamental acoustic property of bias flow liner in terms of the wall impedance is introduced and the different derivations and formulations of this impedance yielding the different published model descriptions are explained and compared. Finally, a parametric study reveals the most relevant parameters for the acoustic damping behaviour of bias flow liners and how this is reflected by the various model representations. Although the general trend of the investigated acoustic behaviour is captured by the different models fairly well for a certain range of parameters, in the transition region between the resonance dominated and the purely bias flow related regime all models lack the correct damping prediction. This seems to be connected to the proper implementation of the reactance as a function of bias flow Mach number...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Composite liners, {{consisting}} of a geomembrane overlying a soil liner, are often required as bottom liners for waste containment systems. In many applica-tions, regulations prescribe the type of liner that must be installed. However, regula-tions often have provisions that permit an alternative liner design, provided that the alternative liner is equivalent to, or as effective as, the prescriptive liner. The current approach for demonstrating equivalency is based on comparing leakage rates for the alternative and prescriptive liners. This approach is too simplistic because leakage rate is not always indicative {{of the mass of}} contaminants discharged from the <b>liner.</b> In this <b>paper,</b> practical equations are presented for predicting the discharge of contaminants from composite liners and for designing alternative liners. The equations can be imple-mented using hand-held calculators or computer spreadsheet applications. Some of these equations are shown to provide predictions of mass flux and contaminant break-through that are similar to predictions made with more complex one- and three-dimen-sional numerical models for composite liners having perfect contact, circular defects,...|$|R
