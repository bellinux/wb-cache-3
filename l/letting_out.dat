5|$|The Well-Manicured Man prefers subtlety to brute force, {{and will}} attempt to {{manipulate}} those in his way before using physical violence. Although the Syndicate's goals are opposed to those of Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), the Well-Manicured Man will, at times, aid them with clues or information, believing that <b>letting</b> <b>out</b> {{a certain amount of}} information would help to keep the two close, and consequently allow for them to be controlled. The Well-Manicured Man openly despises The Smoking Man, seeing him as impulsive and unprofessional. The two maintain a bitter relationship within the Syndicate throughout the series. The Well-Manicured Man is instrumental in the Syndicate's secondary agenda, to develop a vaccination against the black oil used by the aliens as a means of mind control. To this end, he works with Russian double agent Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) to develop a vaccine, eventually testing it—successfully—on a Syndicate mole, Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden).|$|E

25|$|In 1938, {{champion}} Joe Louis {{announced that}} he would face Schmeling for the title. The rematch became an instant international sensation. Many clamored impatiently for its happening, but others, afraid of international tensions and the possibility of Hitler taking over the championship, protested. The controversy and ballyhoo led to the event becoming the most anticipated boxing match since the rematch between Dempsey and Gene Tunney, or possibly earlier. Louis, with his poor, black roots was adopted by American fans as the symbol of America as a land of opportunity. In contrast, Americans perceived Schmeling and his ties to Hitler as an obvious threat to those opportunities and ideals. When the German walked to the ring at Yankee Stadium on 22 June 1938, he did so under a hail of garbage thrown from the stands. Louis came out blazing in the first round and Schmeling tried to counter-punch as he had in the first bout, but to no avail. Driven into the ropes and battered with a fusillade of short, crisp blows from every angle, Schmeling turned his back to his opponent and clutched onto the ropes, <b>letting</b> <b>out</b> a scream that even years later, many spectators could recall vividly. Schmeling later said that he screamed because he had been hit with a blow to the kidneys. Schmeling's knees buckled under the punishment, and referee Arthur Donovan pushed Louis away, beginning a count on Schmeling. Schmeling reluctantly stepped away from the ropes, and Donovan allowed him to continue. A few punches later, Schmeling was knocked down again. From then on, he was helpless. He rose but fell moments later, and Donovan stopped the fight.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the death}} of Harman's son Albion in 1968, Lundy was put up for sale in 1969. Jack Hayward, a British millionaire, {{purchased}} the island for £150,000 (£ today) [...] {{and gave it to}} the National Trust, who leased it to the Landmark Trust. The Landmark Trust has managed the island since then, deriving its income from arranging day trips, <b>letting</b> <b>out</b> holiday cottages and from donations. In May 2015 a sculpture by Antony Gormley was erected on Lundy. It is one of five life-sized sculptures, Land, placed near the centre and at four compass points of the UK in a commission by the Landmark Trust, to celebrate its 50th anniversary.

500|$|A {{document}} from 1200 AD mentions a walled garden {{owned by}} the Benedictine monks of the Abbey of St Peter, Westminster. A later document, dated between 1250 and 1283, refers to [...] "the garden of the Abbot and Convent of Westminster". By the 13th century this had become a [...] quadrangle of mixed orchard, meadow, pasture and arable land, lying between modern-day St Martin's Lane and Drury Lane, and Floral Street and Maiden Lane. The use of the name [...] "Covent"—an Anglo-French term for a religious community, equivalent to [...] "monastery" [...] or [...] "convent"—appears in a document in 1515, when the Abbey, which had been <b>letting</b> <b>out</b> parcels of land along {{the north side of}} the Strand for inns and market gardens, granted a lease of the walled garden, referring to it as [...] "a garden called Covent Garden".

On 10 June, at the 2010 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony, Shakira performed [...] "She Wolf", [...] "Hips Don't Lie", and the official 2010 FIFA World Cup song, [...] "Waka Waka (This Time For Africa)". On 26 June, Shakira performed the song at the Glastonbury Festival, {{which took place in}} Pilton, Somerset.

500|$|Williams' {{portrayal}} of the role was intended {{to act as a}} counterpoint to Jerry Hardin's {{portrayal of}} X's predecessor, Deep Throat. Whereas Deep Throat had been a selfless character, X was written and performed as a scared, selfish character. Prior to the episode [...] "One Breath", Glen Morgan had felt that the character of X was not [...] "going over too well" [...] with fans of the series, as he seemed to simply be a copy of Deep Throat. Believing Williams to be an actor worth having as a series regular, he included in the episode a scene in which X murders witnesses who have seen him speaking to Fox Mulder. Morgan felt that such a scene reflected X's paranoia and the difference between him and his predecessor, noting that [...] "Deep Throat was a guy willing to lose his life for <b>letting</b> <b>out</b> the secret, whereas X is a guy who's still scared". [...] Williams has stated that he has never attempted to rationalize the character's motives or imagine a backstory for him, preferring to play the role with as little background as possible; he once stated [...] "the less I know about him, the more interesting he becomes." ...|$|E

500|$|The Head Wall {{was built}} in 1834 when the medieval village was {{abandoned}} and a new one planned between Tobar Childa and the sea some 700feet (200 m) down the slope. This came about {{as the result of}} a visit by Sir Thomas Dyke Ackland, one of the members of parliament for Devon. Appalled by the primitive conditions, he gave money for the building of a completely new settlement of thirty new blackhouses. These houses were made of dry stone, had thick walls, and were roofed with turf. Each typically had only one tiny window and a small opening for <b>letting</b> <b>out</b> smoke from the peat fire that burnt in the middle of the room. As a result, the interiors were blackened by soot. The cattle occupied one end of the house in winter, and once a year the straw from the floor was stripped out and spread on the ground. [...] In October 1860, several of the new dwellings were damaged by a severe gale, and repairs were sufficient only to make them suitable for use as byres. According to Alasdair MacGregor's analysis of the settlement, the sixteen modern, zinc-roofed cottages amidst the black houses and new Factor's house seen in most photographs of the native islanders were constructed around 1862.|$|E
500|$|One major {{breakthrough}} was {{the composition of}} the song [...] "Let It Go" [...] by songwriters Lopez and Anderson-Lopez, which forced the production team to reconceptualize and rewrite Elsa as a far more complex, vulnerable, and sympathetic character. In The Daily Telegraphs words, instead of the villain envisioned by the producers, the songwriters saw Elsa as [...] "a scared girl struggling to control and come to terms with her gift." [...] Lee recalled: [...] "Bobby and Kristen said they were walking in Prospect Park and they just started talking about what would it feel like [...] Forget villain. Just what it would feel like. And this concept of <b>letting</b> <b>out</b> who she is that she's kept to herself for so long and she's alone and free, but then the sadness of the fact [...] that the last moment is she's alone. It’s not a perfect thing, but it's powerful." [...] Del Vecho explained that [...] "Let It Go" [...] changed Elsa into a person [...] "ruled by fear and Anna was ruled by her own love of other people and her own drive," [...] which in turn caused Lee to [...] "rewrite the first act and then that rippled through the entire movie. So that was when we really found the movie and who these characters were." ...|$|E

2500|$|Breeding {{maturity}} {{is thought}} to be reached at 3-4 years of age. All mating and egg-laying is largely restricted to April and early May. A red-crowned crane pair [...] duets in various situations, helping to establish formation and maintenance of the pair bond, as well as territorial advertisement and agonistic signaling. The pair moves rhythmically until they are standing close, throwing their heads back and <b>letting</b> <b>out</b> a fluting call in unison, often triggering other pairs to start duetting, as well. As it is occurs year around, the social implications of dancing are complex in meaning. However, dancing behavior is generally thought to show excitement in the species. To strengthen the bond, red-crowned cranes engage in dual honking rituals before performing a dance.|$|E
