40|$|Self-paced {{learning}} (SPL) {{mimics the}} cognitive mechanism {{of humans and}} animals that gradually learns from easy to hard samples. One key issue in SPL is to obtain better weighting strategy that is determined by minimizer function. Existing methods usually pursue this by artificially designing the explicit form of SPL regularizer. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} minimizer function, and study a group of new regularizer, named self-paced implicit regularizer that is deduced from robust loss function. Based on the convex conjugacy theory, the minimizer function for self-paced implicit regularizer can be directly learned from the <b>latent</b> <b>loss</b> function, while the analytic form of the regularizer can be even known. A general framework (named SPL-IR) for SPL is developed accordingly. We demonstrate that the learning procedure of SPL-IR is associated with latent robust loss functions, thus can provide some theoretical inspirations for its working mechanism. We further analyze the relation between SPL-IR and half-quadratic optimization. Finally, we implement SPL-IR to both supervised and unsupervised tasks, and experimental results corroborate our ideas and demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of implicit regularizers.

These raised hens were {{housed in the}} environmental chamber converted to individual cages and managed to keep ammonia levels below 4 ppm. ^ The laying hens, at 61 to 74 weeks of age, were individually exposed to one of ten heat stress environments having dry bulb temperatures of 30, 32, 34, 36, or 38 C and relative humidities of either 50 or 90 %. The rates of sensible and <b>latent</b> heat <b>loss,</b> respiratory rate, and rectal temperature from each hen were measured every five minutes for a maximum of five hours or until their rectal temperature reached 44. 5 C. Twenty one physiological variables from these measurements were correlated with an index value calculated from various weighting combinations of the dry plus wet bulb temperatures of the corresponding heat stress environments. The weighting combination of 0. 40 for the wet bulb plus 0. 60 for the dry bulb temperature were selected for calculating the temperature-humidity index for laying hens. ^ Hens from the same flock, after having a 30 day minimum recovery period from the heat exposure, were then exposed to an environment containing a 30 ppm concentration of ammonia for nine days. Rates of respiratory, cutaneous, and total <b>latent</b> heat <b>loss</b> were measured every 15 seconds for two hours in an ammonia-free calorimeter at dry bulb temperatures of either 26 or 34 C and 50 % relative humidity on the day prior to exposure and on the third, sixth, and ninth days of exposure. ^ Rates of respiratory and cutaneous <b>latent</b> heat <b>loss</b> averaged 2. 3 and 2. 6 watts per bird and 0. 9 and 1. 1 watts per bird at 26 C and 34 C, respectively.

The <b>latent</b> respiratory heat <b>loss</b> showed a linear and positive correlation with ambient temperature.

30|$|Lu et al. (2015) defined “cooling power” as the {{increase}} of heat loss from the steady state condition. This study uses the term as the increment of heat loss from the beginning. The cooling power of FAN was 4.1  W/m 2 for the whole body. The sensible heat loss of manikin was 47.0  W/m 2 and {{the ratio of the}} increment was about 9 %. The cooling power of VEST was 7.5  W/m 2 at largest. The cooling power for sensible heat of FANS is larger than that of VEST in these measurements. FANS changes the convective heat transfer coefficient around the body, which affects the sensible heat <b>loss</b> and the <b>latent</b> heat <b>loss</b> from the human body. VEST cools down the body mainly by direct contact and it work for sensible heat loss. Considering the effect to <b>latent</b> heat <b>loss,</b> FANS is more effective than VEST. Beside the cooling power itself, the lasting periods of the peak value were about 180  min for FANS but about 30  min for VEST. Workers with VEST might have to change its cooling bags every half an hour, which is not realistic in construction sites. Contrary to VEST, workers with FANS only have to change batteries every 3  h. FANS have an advantage in practical point of view. But VEST has the effect of cooling down the body locally and directly. It may be useful for limited usage such as to the work with high surrounding temperature in the afternoon.|$|R

40|$|International audienceAir-sea ice-ocean {{interactions}} in the Ross Sea sector form dense waters that feed the global thermohaline circulation. In this paper, we develop the new limited-area ocean-sea ice-atmosphere coupled model TANGO {{to simulate the}} Ross Sea sector. TANGO is built up by coupling the atmospheric limited-area model MAR to a regional configuration of the ocean-sea ice model NEMO. A method is then developed to identify the mechanisms by which local coupling affects the simulations. TANGO is shown to simulate realistic sea ice properties and atmospheric surface temperatures. These skills are mostly related to {{the skills of the}} stand alone atmospheric and oceanic models used to build TANGO. Nonetheless, air temperatures over ocean and winter sea ice thickness are found to be slightly improved in coupled simulations as compared to standard stand alone ones. Local atmosphere ocean feedbacks over the open ocean are found to significantly influence ocean temperature and salinity. In a stand alone ocean configuration, the dry and cold air produces an ocean cooling through sensible and <b>latent</b> heat <b>loss.</b> In a coupled configuration, the atmosphere is in turn moistened and warmed by the ocean; sensible and <b>latent</b> heat <b>loss</b> is therefore reduced as compared to the stand alone simulations. The atmosphere is found to be less sensitive to local feedbacks than the ocean. Effects of local feedbacks are increased in the coastal area {{because of the presence of}} sea ice. It is suggested that slow heat conduction within sea ice could amplify the feedbacks. These local feedbacks result in less sea ice production in polynyas in coupled mode, with a subsequent reduction in deep water formation...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1986 The {{principal}} {{objective of this}} analysis {{is the development of}} a methodological approach that would permit a more complete evaluation of the physical and economic consequences of prohibited species by-catch (PSC) losses, such as occur in the harvest of groundfish. To achieve efficient management of the several marine species involved in the groundfish and associated PSC controversy, U. S. regulatory authorities sought to obtain estimates of the probable economic and physical impacts attributable to these harvesting activities. Early efforts were based upon the assumption that all PSC losses would have accrued to directed fisheries in the year subsequent to that in which the by-caught specimen would have been legally harvestable. The present analysis hypothesizes that substantial latent economic costs, associated with foregone reproductive potential, are also attributable to PSC losses and incorrectly ignored by previous assessment methodologies. To test this assertion an alternative methodology was developed and empirically applied to the case of Pacific salmon PSCs in the Gulf of Alaska groundfish fisheries. The empirical results demonstrate the presence of substantial <b>latent</b> <b>losses</b> associated with salmon PSC reproductive potential foregone. Although preliminary, these results confirm the presence of the hypothesized long run adverse economic impacts on directed salmon fisheries associated with a single season's PSC interception. Similar results would be expected in the case of Pacific halibut, king crab, and Tanner crab, although substantial research on the biological impacts of PSC losses on these species remains to be done. Refinement of the economic components of the proposed model and improvement of the primary data upon which it relies will, likewise, involve substantial investments in further research...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth and}} decay {{mechanisms}} of subtropical dipole modes {{in the southern}} Indian and South Atlantic Oceans and their impacts on southern African rainfall are investigated using results from a coupled general circulation model originally developed for predicting tropical climate variations. The second (most) dominant mode of interannual sea surface temperature (SST) variations in the southern Indian (South Atlantic) Ocean represents a northeast-southwest oriented dipole, now called subtropical dipole mode. The positive (negative) SST interannual anomaly pole starts to grow in austral spring and reaches its peak in February. In austral late spring, the suppressed (enhanced) <b>latent</b> heat flux <b>loss</b> associated with the variations in the subtropical high causes a thinner (thicker) than normal mixed layer thickness that, in turn, enhances (reduces) the warming of the mixed layer by the climatological shortwave radiation.

The increased (decreased) <b>latent</b> heat <b>loss</b> due to the warmer (colder) SST also contributes to the decay of the positive (negative) pole.

The rate of evaporation heat loss is directly related to the vapor pressure at the skin surface and the amount of moisture present on the skin.

The poor performance of the reanalyses contrasts with estimates based on ship meteorological reports in the SOC flux dataset. The array averaged net heat flux from the SOC dataset agrees with the buoy value to within 10 Wm- 2.

The Computational Fluid Dynamics approach is used for modeling fluid flow and for predicting convective heat transfer between manikin surface elements and the environment...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{phase change}} {{material}} (PCM) with macro-encapsulation is attractive in energy storage applications {{as it has}} relatively low cost. This study focuses on using PET plastic pipes to encapsulate paraffin and using low-cost float stones to increase the thermal conductivity of PCM modules as they have a special structure of high porosity. Float stones were immersed in the liquid PCM and an ultrasonic welding method used to prevent leakage of the PET plastic pipes. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to discover {{the appearance of the}} composite PCM. The thermal performance of the PCM cylinder module was analyzed through experimental tests of a constant-temperature water bath and numerical simulations. The result indicates that this PCM Ccylinder module is superior in thermal energy storage compared with the reference module even though fewer PCM was contained and the <b>latent</b> heat <b>loss</b> is considerable. The pipe diameter is an important parameter when using this kind of PCM cylinder module in water tanks...|$|R
40|$|Matching {{vegetation}} {{to growing}} conditions on green roofs {{is one of}} the options to increase biodiversity in cities. A hydrological model has been applied to match the hydrological requirements of natural vegetation types to roof substrate parameters and to simulate moisture stress for specific substrate properties and substrate depth as a matching criterion. Additionally the model simulations allow quantifying effects of roof vegetation on the water balance of a roof, thus providing information regarding cooling effects, roof water retention and runoff. Results also suggest that vegetation types respond very sensitive to substrate type at shallow substrate depths. Conclusions regarding potential vegetation types become less variable for deep substrates. Simulation results also suggest that the law of diminishing returns holds for cooling by <b>latent</b> heat <b>loss</b> and retention as a function of substrate thickness. Local variability of evapotranspiration conditions in city climate is addressed using a sensitivity analysis, and suggests that substrate with a strong mineral component may be more sensitive to local condition...|$|R
40|$|Meteorological {{conditions}} and evaporation from snow and tundra surfaces were {{measured in the}} tundra area in Spitsbergen {{from the end of}} May to the end of June in 1993. In this period, three types of ground surface were seen, i. e. dry snow, melting snow and snow-free tundra. Clear changes in evaporation as well as the meteorological conditions were seen with the changes in surface condition. During the dry snow period, evaporation predominated at the snow surface and the <b>latent</b> heat <b>loss</b> by evaporation suppressed the snowmelt. During the snowmelt period, the temperature of the snow cover was 0 ℃ from the surface to the bottom, and condensation predominated due to the increase of vapor pressure in the air. The latent heat by condensation contributed to the snowmelt. After the seasonal snow was gone and the meltwater was still abundant at the tundra surface, intense evaporation of about 3. 7 mmday^ occurred with the rapid surface temperature increase, while condensation occurred on the remaining snow surface...|$|R
40|$|The four {{components}} of the long-term annual mean net surface heating of the tropical Pacific Ocean between 30 °N and 40 °S are calculated and portrayed. These flux elements were derived by using the bulk formulas and about 5 million marine weather reports for the years 1957 – 76. In addition to illustrating the mean solar, latent heat, infrared radiation and sensible heat fluxes, annual mean values of the atmospheric variables which contribute to those fluxes also are illustrated. A simple error analysis is carried out from which it is concluded that the 95 % confidence bands for solar heating, <b>latent</b> heat <b>loss</b> and net oceanic heating are ± 29, ± 39 and ± 49 W m⁻², from the respective mean values. The validity of {{the results for the}} net heating is partially tested by comparing the horizontal heat transports required by the pattern of heating with independent estimates of those dynamical transports...|$|R
