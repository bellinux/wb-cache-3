40|$|Abstract. The leaking {{of water}} pipes {{will not only}} waste {{a large amount of}} water but also cause great {{economical}} damage. This paper is about the research on the <b>leaking</b> <b>detector</b> based on DSP. At first, the <b>leaking</b> <b>detector</b> can collect sound signals that flow two sides by pressure sensors fixed at {{the two sides of the}} water pipes, then it will enlarge and remove the noise of the collected sound signals. At last, with the assistance of relative information about signals, it can find out the exact leaking position. Having passed physical verification, this <b>leaking</b> <b>detector</b> can figure out the exact location of water pipe leaking...|$|R

5000|$|The {{investigators}} {{also noted}} that the steel clamp used to lock the hose connected to the gas range’s nozzle was found far from where it should be, which meant that the workers did not properly refit the hose,“This is the proximate cause of the gas leak.

40|$|High Technology Systems (HTS) with {{sensitive}} surfaces, such as superconducting {{radio frequency}} (SRF) accelerating cavities, polarized electron sources (PES) for accelerators and many others, {{are prone to}} degradation when subjected to particulate or hydrocarbon contaminants. Particulate contamination control of SRF cavity surfaces and vacuum components have been discussed by several authors at this contamination workshop. Hydrocarbon contamination mainly results from prolonged evacuation with conventional oil lubricated pumping systems and/or prolonged leak detection with conventional <b>leak</b> <b>detectors.</b> The sensitivity of the conventional <b>leak</b> <b>detectors</b> suffers due to the back-streaming of atmospheric helium (5 x 10 {sup {minus} 1 } Pa) through the pumping systems and/or the trapping of helium in the O-rings and oils of the pumping systems. This reduced sensitivity leads {{to the use of}} the <b>leak</b> <b>detectors</b> over long periods of time for detecting small (1 x 10 {sup {minus} 10 } atm. cc s{sup {minus} 1 }) leaks in HTS thereby exposing the sensitive surfaces to contamination. In this paper, a review of the work in progress, at Thomas Jefferson Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab), in reducing the contamination of sensitive surfaces is presented...|$|R

40|$|Many helium mass {{spectrometer}} <b>leak</b> <b>detectors</b> at KSC employ sampling systems that feature hand held sniffer probes. Authors of general leakage-testing literature recommend sniffer probes for leak location {{but not for}} quantitative leakage measurement. Their use in the latter application at KSC involves assumptions that may be subtle. The purpose of the research effort reported herein was to establish the significance of indicated leak rates displayed by sniffer-probe equipped <b>leak</b> <b>detectors</b> and {{to determine whether the}} use of alternative hardware or testing procedures may reduce the uncertainty of leakage measurements made with them. The report classifies probe-type sampling systems for helium <b>leak</b> <b>detectors</b> according to their internal plumbing (direct or branched), presents a basic analysis of the fluid dynamics in the sampling system in the branched-conduit case, describes the usual test method for measuring the internal supply-to-sample flowrate ratio (a. k. a permeation ratio), and describes a concept for a sponge-tipped probe whose external supply-to-sample flowrate ratio promises to be lower than that of a simple-ended probe. One conclusion is that the main source of uncertainty in the use of probe-type sampling systems for leakage measurement is uncertainty in the external supply-to-sample flowrate ratio. In contrast, the present method for measuring the internal supply-to-sample flowrate ratio is quantitative and satisfactory. The implication is that probes of lower external supply-to-sample flowrate ratio must be developed before this uncertainty may be reduced significantly...|$|R
