40|$|Now a days UML {{is widely}} used for {{preparing}} design documents. It helps to specify, construct, visualize and document artifacts of software systems. Here we are proposing an approach to test the software in the early stage (design phase) of software development life cycle, {{so that it can}} help the software testers in the later stages. Our approach aims at generating test scenarios and prioritizing the test scenarios from UML 2. x sequence diagram. The objective of test prioritization is to schedule the tests in a particular order so that the testing process can be performed in an optimized way keeping in mind factors like, cost and time. The most challenging problem in generating test scenarios from UML 2. x sequence diagram is the presence of fragments such as alt, <b>loop,</b> <b>break,</b> par, opt etc. We propose an intermediate control flow graph in a testable form named Sequence Control Flow Graph (SCFG) resulting from the control flow analysis of UML 2. x sequence diagrams. We also propose an algorithm, which is used for generating test scenarios from UML 2. x Sequence diagrams. The test scenarios generated by our approach are suitable for detection of scenario faults, use case dependency and system testing. Finally we propose an efficient approach to prioritize test scenarios...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 90 - 92) This study {{compared the}} strength (single strand/loop breaking load and breaking elongation), shrinkage, and seam strength of nine brands of all-purpose polyester home sewing threads to 1) determine {{differences among the}} various brands, between the types, among the white threads and black threads of each brand, and between the white threads and black threads of each type, and 2) ascertain whether any associations exist between thread strength, shrinkage, and/or seam strength and the thread variables of twist, diameter, breaking load and breaking elongation. Microscopic examination revealed that two brands were core spun and seven were tow spun type threads. Data resulting from the standard testing procedures were tested statistically by analysis of variance or the Student's "t" test. Associations were determined by Pearson's correlation coefficient. Differences occurred among and within both the brands {{and the types of}} thread. Single strand breaking load varied significantly only among the tow spun black threads. The <b>loop</b> <b>breaking</b> strength of the tow spun threads was greater than that of the core spun threads. The core spun black threads were stronger than the core spun white threads in <b>loop</b> <b>breaking</b> strength. The core spun threads had the higher single strand breaking elongation. A significant variation in single strand elongation occurred among the white threads and the black threads of both the tow spun and core spun threads. Variation in <b>loop</b> <b>breaking</b> elongation existed among the brands. Variation in <b>loop</b> <b>breaking</b> elongation also occurred among the white tow spun threads and between the black core spun threads. The core spun threads exhibited more shrinkage than the tow spun threads. Seams sewn with the white tow spun threads were stronger than those sewn with the white core spun thread. Significant correlations resulted between three variables: single strand <b>breaking</b> load and <b>loop</b> <b>breaking</b> load, single strand breaking load and diameter, and diameter and yarn number...|$|R

In this paper, a methodology, based {{on the concept of}} graph theory and process integration, is proposed to evolve a preliminary RAN into a simpler one involving fewer interconnections (matches) by incurring the minimum resource penalty. The proposed methodology is essentially based on four evolution strategies: <b>loop</b> <b>breaking</b> without. violation, two-loop relaxation, <b>loop</b> <b>breaking</b> with path relaxation, and direct path elimination. The procedure is applied to various RANs such as water allocation, hydrogen allocation, and material allocation in a reuse network.

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 The {{purposes}} of this study were: to compare the strength (single strand <b>breaking</b> load and <b>loop</b> <b>breaking</b> load), the elongation and the evenness of four types represented by 11 brands of polyester sewing threads available on the market in Corvallis, Oregon in January, 1976; to determine whether there were differences in the strength and elongation of black and white threads; and to find the correlations between: the single strand breaking load and the <b>loop</b> <b>breaking</b> load of a thread; the single strand breaking load and the elongation of a thread; and the breaking load and the evenness of a thread. The four types of thread were: corespun polyester/cotton 2 -ply, corespun polyester/cotton 3 -ply, short staple spun polyester and tow spun polyester. Some differences were observed among different types and among various brands within the same type of thread in every property that was investigated. In comparing the single strand breaking loads, corespun 3 -ply threads were significantly stronger than the corespun 2 -ply thread of the same brand; corespun 3 -ply threads exhibited no significant differences from tow spun threads; short staple spun threads were significantly weaker than corespun 3 -ply and tow spun threads. Comparisons of <b>loop</b> <b>breaking</b> load indicated that tow spun threads still performed best, followed by short staple spun threads. Corespun 3 -ply threads were weaker than both tow spun threads and short staple spun threads. The corespun 2 -ply thread was the weakest of all. Corespun 3 -ply threads had better extensibility than the corespun 2 -ply thread and the short staple spun threads; short staple spun threads, in turn, were more extensible than tow spun threads. With a few exceptions, no significant differences in the breaking load and elongation of black and white thread occurred. The evenness of all 11 brands of thread was similar. Based on this study, the tow spun threads would be a good choice for fabrics with normal extensibility. Two of the three corespun 3 -ply threads would be suitable for fabrics which stretch more. No significant correlations were found between: single strand <b>breaking</b> load and <b>loop</b> <b>breaking</b> load; single strand breaking load and evenness; and <b>loop</b> <b>breaking</b> load and evenness. Although a high positive correlation between single strand breaking load and elongation was not significant at the. 05 level, the relationship appears fruitful for further study because only the tow spun threads and one of the short staple spun threads had a much lower rate of elongation relative to the single strand breaking load...|$|R

The regularized area is invariant under a one parameter family of continuous deformations of the boundary contour which are not related to the global symmetry of the problem.

40|$|Bifurcations {{leading to}} complex {{dynamical}} behaviour of non-linear systems are often encountered when {{the characteristics of}} feedback circuits in the system are varied. In systems with many unknown or varying parameters, it is an interesting, but difficult problem to find parameter values for which specific bifurcations occur. In this paper, we develop a <b>loop</b> <b>breaking</b> approach to evaluate the influence of parameter values on feedback circuit characteristics. This approach allows a theoretical classification of feedback circuit characteristics related to possible bifurcations in the system. Based on the theoretical results, a numerical algorithm for bifurcation search in a possibly high-dimensional parameter space is developed. The application of the proposed algorithm is illustrated by searching for a Hopf bifurcation in {{a model of the}} mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, which is a classical example for biochemical signal transduction.

We have determined the influence of different factors on decay of an inhomogeneous vortex tangle: a diffusion (large vortex <b>loops</b> <b>break</b> up to smaller ones which go away from initial volume), change of length owing to reconnection processes, the eliminations of small vortices below the space resolution, the insertion and removing of points to supply numerical algorithm stability.

The unrestrained loops gain then kinetic energy corrupting short secondary structure elements without corrupting the core of the protein. The MD-derived ensembles agree with experimental observables and draw a picture of the intermediate state inconsistent with a well-defined structure and characteristic of a typical partially disordered protein.
