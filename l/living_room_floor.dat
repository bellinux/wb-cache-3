40|$|We {{characterized}} {{the prevalence of}} cockroach allergen exposure in a nationally representative sample of U. S. homes and assessed risk factors for elevated concentrations. DESIGN: We used data from the National Survey of Lead and Allergens in Housing, a populationbased cross-sectional survey. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were residents of 831 U. S. homes in the survey. EVALUATIONS/MEASUREMENTS: We analyzed allergen, questionnaire, and observational data of 831 U. S. homes. RESULTS: Cockroach allergen (Bla g 1) concentrations exceed 2. 0 U/g, a level associated with allergic sensitization, in 11 % of U. S. <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>floors</b> and 13 % of kitchen floors. Concentrations exceed 8. 0 U/g, a level associated with asthma morbidity, in 3 % of <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>floors</b> and 10 % of kitchen floors. Elevated concentrations were observed in high-rise apartments, urban settings, pre- 1940 constructions, and households with incomes 8. 0 U/g were greatest when roach problems were reported or observed and increased {{with the number of}} cockroaches observed and with indications of recent cockroach activity. CONCLUSIONS: Household cockroach allergen exposure is characterized in a nationally representative context. The allergen is prevalent in many settings, at levels that may contribute to allergic sensitization and asthma morbidity.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the relationship between wheezing or sensitization and concentrations of mites, cat and dog allergens, and bacterial endotoxin in Palestine. A nested case-control involved analysis of mattress and floor dust from a 110 children's houses with reported wheezing and without wheezing. We found no consistent associations between allergen levels and either wheeze or specific atopic sensitization. Furthermore, no clear associations between mattress endotoxin levels and wheeze or atopy were found. Endotoxin in floor dust was inversely associated with atopic sensitization and wheeze, statistically significant only for atopic wheeze. Finally, a nonsignificant inverse association was observed between <b>living</b> <b>room</b> endotoxin and atopy within the non-wheezing control group. In conclusion, although our study found mostly negative results, it does suggest that endotoxin on <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>floors</b> might protect against atopic wheeze.

40|$|People {{spend most}} of their time inside {{buildings}} and the indoor microbiome is a major part of our everyday environment. It affects humans' wellbeing and therefore its composition is important for use in inferring human health impacts. It is still not well understood how environmental conditions affect indoor microbial communities. Existing studies have mostly focussed on the local (e. g., building units) or continental scale and rarely on the regional scale, e. g. a specific metropolitan area. Therefore, we wanted to identify key environmental determinants for the house dust microbiome from an existing collection of spatially (area of Munich, Germany) and temporally (301 days) distributed samples and to determine changes in the community as a function of time. To that end, dust samples that had been collected once from the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>floors</b> of 286 individual households, were profiled for fungal and bacterial community variation and diversity using microbial fingerprinting techniques. The profiles were tested for their association with occupant behaviour, building characteristics, outdoor pollution, vegetation, and urbanization. Our results showed that more environmental and particularly outdoor factors (vegetation, urbanization, airborne particulate matter) affected the community composition of indoor fungi than of bacteria. The passage of time affected fungi and, surprisingly, also strongly affected bacteria. We inferred that fungal communities in indoor dust changed semi-annually, whereas bacterial communities paralleled outdoor plant phenological periods. These differences in temporal dynamics cannot be fully explained and should be further investigated in future studies on indoor microbiomes...|$|R

40|$|Evidence that indoor {{dampness}} {{and mold}} growth {{are associated with}} respiratory health has been accumulating, but {{few studies have been}} able to examine health risks in relation to measured levels of indoor mold exposure. In particular, {{little is known about the}} contribution of indoor molds to the development of allergic sensitization. As a part of an ongoing study examining the effects of ambient air pollutants on respiratory health and atopic diseases in German school children, we examined the relation between viable mold levels indoors and allergic sensitization in 272 children. We examined whether allergic sensitization in children is associated with higher fungal spore count in settled house dust sampled from <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>floors.</b> Adjusting for age, sex, parental education, region of residency, and parental history of atopy, we found that mold spore counts for Cladosporium and Aspergillus were associated with an increased risk of allergic sensitization. Sensitized children exposed to high levels of mold spores (> 90 th percentile) were more likely to suffer from symptoms of rhinoconjunctivitis. We conclude that elevated indoor concentrations of molds in wintertime might play a role in increasing the risk of developing atopic symptoms and allergic sensitization not only to molds but also to other common, inhaled allergens. These effects were strongest in the group of children who had lived in the same home since birth. Key words: allergic sensitization, house dust, indoor allergen exposure, molds.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Investigations {{in urban}} areas have just begun to explore how the indoor dust {{microbiome}} may affect the pathogenesis of asthma and allery. We aimed to investigate the early fungal and bacterial microbiome in house dust with allergic sensitization and wheezing later in childhood. METHODS: Individual dust samples from 189 homes of the LISAplus birth cohort study were collected shortly after birth from <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>floors</b> and profiled for fungal and bacterial microbiome. Fungal and bacterial diversity was assessed with terminal {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (tRFLP) and defined by the Simpson diversity index. Information on wheezing outcomes and co-variates until the age of 10 years was obtained by parental questionnaires. Information on specific allergic sensitization was available at 6 and 10 years. Logistic regression and General Estimation Equation (GEE) models were used {{to examine the relationship between}} microbial diversity and health outcomes. RESULTS: Logistic regression analyses revealed a significantly reduced risk of developing sensitization to aero-allergens at 6 years and ever wheezing until the age of 10 years for exposure to higher fungal diversity (adjusted Odds Ratio aOR (95 %CI) : 0. 26 (0. 10 - 0. 70)), and 0. 42 (0. 18 - 0. 96), respectively), in adjusted analyses. The associations were attenuated for the longitudinal analyses (GEE) until the age of 10 years. There was no association between higher exposure to bacterial diversity and the tested health outcomes. CONCLUSION: Higher early exposure to fungal diversity might help to prevent from developing sensitization to aero-allergens in early childhood, but the reasons for attenuated effects in later childhood require further prospective studies...|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the efficacy of}} health education in reducing indoor arthropod allergens in Seoul. The mite control measures comprised the use of mite-proof mattress and pillow coverings, regular washing of potentially infested materials, maintenance of a low humidity, removal of carpets, and frequent vacuum cleaning. Cockroach control measures included trapping, application of insecticides, and protecting food. Of 201 homes enrolled in October 1999, 63 volunteers were included in a 2 -year follow-up survey between April 2000 and January 2002. Before intervention, the density of mites/g of dust varied greatly; 27. 1 /g in children's bedding, 20 /g in adult bedding, 7. 2 /g on the floors of children's bedrooms, 6. 8 /g in sofas, 5. 9 /g on the floors of adult's bedrooms, 3. 9 /g on <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>floors,</b> 3. 7 /g in carpets, and 1. 9 mites/g on kitchen floors. The predominant mite species and house percentages infested were; Dermatophagoides farinae 93 %, D. pteronyssinus 9 %, and Tyrophagus putrescentiae 8 %. Comparing 1999 and 2001 infestations, before and after 25 mo of education, mite abundance was reduced by 98 %, from 23. 7 to 0. 57 mites/g of dust. In 1999, cockroaches were detected in 62 % homes: 36 % Blattella germanica and 35 % Periplaneta spp., including 9 % double infestations of B. germanica and P. americana. Following intervention, cockroach infestation rates decreased to 22 % of houses in 2000 and 23 % in 2001.

40|$|Background Pet {{ownership}} is consistently {{associated with higher}} indoor endotoxin concentrations, but may also {{be related to the}} amount of greenspace around the home. This study examined whether the association between pet ownership and higher indoor endotoxin concentrations is confounded or modified by residential greenspace. Methods Information on pet ownership was collected at the time of recruitment of the German LISA birth cohort. Endotoxin levels were measured in settled house dust sampled from mothers' mattresses (N = 1197) and <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>floors</b> (N = 390). Greenspace around the home was assessed as the mean Normalized Difference Vegetation Index in 100 m, 500 m and 1000 m buffers around the home, and as the distance to the nearest urban and natural green space. Linear regression models assessed cross-sectional associations between pet ownership and log-transformed endotoxin levels, adjusted for known predictors of endotoxin levels. Confounding by greenspace was assessed by additionally adjusting the models for each greenspace variable. Effect modification was assessed by including interaction terms between pet ownership and each greenspace variable, and by model stratification. Results Dog and cat ownership were associated with higher endotoxin levels in mothers' mattresses, whereas only dog ownership was associated with endotoxin levels in the floor samples. All associations were highly robust to further adjustment for greenspace, and there was little evidence to suggest any effect modification (interaction terms had p-values > 0. 05). Conclusions Residential greenspace did not confound or modify the association between pet ownership and indoor endotoxin levels. Studies should continue investigating whether pets influence the indoor environment only by their presence, or also by acting as transmission vectors of the outdoors...|$|R
