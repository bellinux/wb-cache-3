The group of girls gathers together and collect flowers. They would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> off and demonstrate to the public how pretty flowers look. Flowers are associated with how pretty the girls are in the colorful costumes. They form circles and triangles during the dance. Sophisticated hand movements and spins create very cheerful atmosphere. The music is up-bit and energetic.|$|E

She also hoped that she is not as irritating as Natasha in real life and added [...] "I'm not a manipulative teenage girl who's forever wanting everything her own way." [...] In March 2011, Novakovic revealed that she would like to see Natasha become a nicer person, grow up and turn over a new leaf. She said [...] "There are glimpses of the nice girl in Tash." [...] She later said that as she has played the villain for over a year, she would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> Natasha's [...] "softer, funnier side."

I’ve never sought publicity.” He continued to paint well into his nineties and celebrated his one hundredth birthday {{at his home in}} Silvermine surrounded by family and friends. He died in Norwalk, Connecticut a few months later.|$|E
2500|$|She {{taught at}} Columbia College, Columbia, South Carolina in late 1915, where she {{completed}} {{a series of}} highly innovative charcoal abstractions, [...] based on her personal sensations. The Georgia O'Keeffe museum says that {{she was one of}} the first American artists to practice pure abstraction. O'Keeffe mailed the drawings to friend and former classmate at Teachers College, Anita Pollitzer, who took them to Alfred Stieglitz at his 291 gallery early in 1916.

In early 1916, O'Keeffe was in New York at Teachers College, Columbia University. In April that year, Stieglitz exhibited ten of her drawings at 291.|$|E
2500|$|Delson's {{style is}} {{sometimes}} criticized {{as being too}} simplistic, lacking complexity, and largely limited to non-solo, non-instrumental sections, particularly during the Hybrid Theory and Meteora eras. He has stated that he [...] "doesn't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> off", and that he attempts to play his guitar so that {{it sounds as though}} it were the keyboard or strings so as to seamlessly fit in with the band's hip-hop- and electronica-style compositions. [...] Delson has also stated that he likes to produce a gritty, [...] "sampled" [...] feel with his sound. [...] Although a self-described [...] "fervent opponent of guitar leads," [...] he started performing solos in the Minutes to Midnight era after his bandmates encouraged him to do so. Delson performs guitar solos on the tracks [...] "What I've Done," [...] "In Pieces" [...] and [...] "The Little Things Give You Away." [...] Delson also played many solos on Linkin Park's 6th studio album The Hunting Party.|$|E

2500|$|Gillan {{stated that}} [...] "having {{read the first}} episode I was utterly smitten , and with the character. Amy's a sassy lady, funny and passionate, and her {{relationship}} with the Doctor has a really interesting dynamic". Gillan believed that the Doctor still saw Amy as the same seven-year-old girl he first met, and described their relationship as brother and sister, with Amy sometimes acting as an [...] "annoying little sister". She also did not want Amy, like previous companions, to stand around [...] "in awe of the Doctor all the time" [...] or [...] "mope around" [...] while he was not there; Amy would [...] "do her own thing, whether it's fighting monsters in strange new worlds or just getting {{on with her life}} in her own village". During her first series, Gillan wanted Amy to act [...] "like a child in an adult body" [...] because she had not properly grown up. She appears more guarded because [...] "she doesn't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> her emotions because she wants to be strong". However, she begins her second series as a more settled person, and shows more emotion, especially with the birth of her daughter.|$|E
2500|$|For {{several years}} Truffaut had become {{increasingly}} interested in people {{from his life}} who had died, beginning with his mentor and father-figure André Bazin, who had died the day before Truffaut began shooting his first feature, The 400 Blows. Truffaut told a reporter for L'Express: [...] "I'm faithful to the dead, I live with them. I'm forty-five and already beginning {{to be surrounded by}} dead people." [...] In 1977 Truffaut lost two other important father-figures: Cinémathèque Française director Henri Langlois and Roberto Rossellini, whom Truffaut called [...] "the most intelligent man, with André Bazin" [...] during an interview with Le Matin de Paris. Around this time Truffaut had watched Shoot the Piano Player and noticed that half the actors had since died. In an interview with [...] magazine Truffaut asked [...] "Why not have the same range of feelings for the dead as for the living, the same aggressive or affectionate relationship?" [...] and added that he wanted to film [...] "what it would be <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> on screen a man who refuses to forget the dead." [...] According to him, The Green Room is not the worshipping of death, but an extension of the love for the people that we have met and who are no longer alive, and the idea that they have a permanency. What matters is that Davenne refuses to forget, and this refusal is important for Truffaut.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music was}} complex and unpredictable, {{with the band}} {{continuing}} with their shifts of musical style. Some of the tracks were in foreign languages and would radically change genres mid-song. Featuring lyrics about death, suicide and child abuse, along with children's songs and a Middle Eastern techno number, music critic Greg Prato described the album as having [...] "a totally original and new musical style that sounds like nothing that currently exists". Not all critics were impressed with the album, with The Washington Post describing it as [...] "an album of cheesy synthesizers, mangled disco beats, virtuosic playing and juvenile noises", calling it [...] "self-indulgent" [...] and adding that [...] "Mr. Bungle's musicians <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> off their classical, jazz and world-beat influences in fast, difficult passages which are technically impressive but never seem to go anywhere". Additionally, writer Scott McGaughey described it as [...] "difficult", and was critical of its [...] "lack of actual songs". Disco Volante included influences from contemporary classical music, avant-garde jazz, electronic music pioneer Pierre Henry, Edgar Allan Poe, John Zorn, Krzysztof Penderecki and European film music of the 1960s and 1970s, such as those composed by Ennio Morricone and Peter Thomas. The album notes also contained an invitation {{to participate in an}} [...] "unusual scam" [...] – if $2 was sent to the band's address, participants would receive additional artwork, lyrics to the songs [...] "Ma Meeshka Mow Skwoz" [...] and [...] "Chemical Marriage" [...] and some stickers. The vinyl release of this album shipped with a 7" [...] by the then-unknown Secret Chiefs 3. [...] In 1996, Theo Lengyel retired as Bungle's original sax player and keyboardist due to creative differences.|$|E
