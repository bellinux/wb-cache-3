We propose {{a system that is}} able to locate simultaneously several “objects ” and to present them, in real time, on a map. The system is dedicated mainly to airports for tracking maintenance cars and persons (in this last case the system works as a personal <b>locator</b> <b>device)</b> and to avoid disasters that could happen on the runway. Several results and aspects of the system are investigated and presented. ...|$|E

Burnett Electronics Pinger Model 512 resulted from a Burnett Electronics Laboratory, Inc. /Langley Research Center contract for development of a search system for underwater mines. The Pinger's battery-powered transmitter is activated when immersed in water, and sends multidirectional signals for up to 500 hours. When a surface receiver picks up the signal, a diver can retrieve the pinger and the attached airplane flight recorder. Other pingers are used to track whales, mark underwater discoveries and assist oil drilling vessels...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is {{to contribute to the}} debate on sustainable policies aimed at reducing personal car- bon emissions from the transport sector. The proposed research describes an experiment extending the cap-and-trade system, employed in manufacturing-based emission curb programs, to Voluntary Travel Behavioral Change (VTBC) program. In particular, a VTBC program is proposed that relies on opportune changes in individual activity-travel patterns after observing actual behavior recorded using an innovative device. In this regard, the methodology developed includes: (1) the design of a new behavioral strategy called “Cap and Save” and (2) the implementation of a new device for daily individual activity travel patterns collection called “Activity Locator”. The two aspects are closely interrelated, since behavioral strategies are usually difficult to evaluate; indeed, data regarding individual behavior before and after policy intervention are rarely collected. From July to October 2009, both the Activity Locator and the Cap and save were implemented during a two-week survey involving a group of students of the University of Cagliari (Italy). The students’ activity-travel behavior over two survey weeks and their feedback on both the Activity <b>Locator</b> <b>device</b> and Cap and save strategy were then analyzed...|$|E
40|$|Weight saving-even {{a matter}} of a few pounds-is an {{important}} consideration in airplane design and. construction. Boeing saved 200 pounds simply by substituting a new type of compressed gas cylinder on their 747 commercial airliners. For quickly evacuating passengers in the event of a ground emergency the 747 escape chutes allow ' passengers to slide to safety from the two-story height of the cabin deck. The chutes pop out of exitways and are automatically inflated in seconds by compressed air stored in pressure vessels. Boeing's weight saving resulted from a recent changeover to a new type of pressure vessel built by Structural Composites Industries Inc. of Azusa, Cal. The company employs technology originally developed for rocket motor casings; the cylinders are constructed by winding fibers around an aluminum liner. This technique offers high strength for very low weight-in this case 60 percent less than the pressure vessels earlier used on the 747. Another contribution to improved air safety is an underwater <b>locator</b> <b>device.</b> Called the "Pinger," it uses sonar techniques to locate aircraft crashed in water-or, more specifically, to recover the flight recorder aboard the airplane. Its recovery provides clues as to what caused the accident and suggests measures to prevent similar future occurrences. Until recently, there was no way to recover flight recorders aboard aircraft lost in water crashes. The Pinger, now serving 95 percent of the airline industry, provides an answer. Key element of the Pinger system is a small, battery-powered transmitter, or homing beacon, included as part of the recorder package. For as long as 30 days, the transmitter sends out an acoustic signal from water depths up to 20, 000 feet. The other element of the system is a receiver, used by search crews to home in on the transmitter's signal. Originating as a U. S. Navy project, this device was refined and further developed by NASA's Langley Research Center to retrieve submerged nose cones from research rockets. NASA's contractor for the transmitter portion of the system was Dukane Corp., St. Charles, Ill. who subsequently developed the commercial version...|$|E

40|$|DSM-IV {{acute stress}} {{disorder}} and {{posttraumatic stress disorder}} (PTSD) {{are known to be}} associated with dissociative symptomatology. Davidson et al. [1] suggested that dissociative symptoms tend not to recur repeatedly, despite PTSD persisting. T h e finding that dissociation in the face of trauma is a marker of long-term psychopathology [2 – 5] suggests that persisting dissociative symptoms in PTSD is an indicator of severity. Enduring dissociative responses to trauma sometimes include fugue states. ‘ F u g u e- l i k e ’states have been noted in acute combat situations [6 – 9]. Kolb [10] observed clini-cally, that combat veterans returning from World War II continued to have dissociative symptoms to subse-quent stressors. This observation is applicable to Vietnam veterans [2]. Indeed Spiegel [11] concluded that Vietnam veterans with PTSD may have more dissociative symptoms than other veterans. In combat veterans with PTSD and fugue states, Young [12] reported the assumption of a not necessarily new i d e n t i t y, but a prior, or different identity. He described a veteran who developed an alternate per-sonality, assuming the identity of a friend who died in combat. McDougle and Southwick [13] reported a return of a prior combat personality during a fugue state of a Vietnam veteran. Fugue states, when durable and prolonged, and a sociated with travel away from home or customary work locale tend to create distress for families and major management difficulties for police, rescue workers and mental health professionals. This is despite the known unlikely risk of sufferers harming themselves either deliberately or by neglect.

40|$|Space flight-induced muscle atrophy/neuromuscular {{degradation}} {{and the consequent}} decrements in crew-member performance are of increasing concern as mission duration lengthens, and planetary exploration after extended space flight is planned. Pre- to post-flight strength measures have demonstrated that specific countermeasures, such as resistive exercise, are effective at countering microgravity-induced muscle atrophy and preventing decrements in muscle strength. However, in-flight assessment/monitoring of exercise countermeasure effectiveness will be essential during exploration class missions due to their duration. The ability to modify an exercise countermeasure prescription based on such real-time information will allow each individual crew member to perform the optimal amount and type of exercise countermeasure to maintain performance. In addition, such measures {{can be used to}} determine if a crew member is physically capable of performing a particular mission-related task during exploration class missions. The challenges faced in acquiring such data are those common to all space operations, namely the requirement for light-weight, low power, mechanically reliable technologies that make valid measurements in microgravity, in this case of muscle strength/neuromuscular function. Here we describe a simple, light-weight, low power, non-invasive device, known as the Myotonometer, that measures tissue stiffness as an indirect measure of muscle contractile state and muscle force production. Repeat myotonometer measurements made at the same location {{on the surface of the}} rectis femoris muscle (as determined using a 3 D <b>locator</b> <b>device,</b> SEM plus or minus 0. 34 mm) were shown to be reproducible over time at both maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and at rest in a total of 17 sedentary subjects assessed three times over a period of seven days. In addition, graded voluntary isometric force production (i. e. 20 %, 40 %, 60 %, 80 % & 100 % of MVC) during knee extension was shown to be significantly (p less than 0. 01) correlated with contemporaneous myotonometer measurements made on the rectis femoris muscle in a total of 16 healthy subjects (8 males, 8 females). Further-more, this device has been operationally tested during parabolic flight demonstrating its suitability for use in a microgravity environment. Our data indicates that the Myotonometer is a viable surrogate measure of muscle contractile state/tone and of muscle strength/force production. Additional studies are required to assess the suitability of this technique for assessing these measures in de-conditioned subjects such as crew-members...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Environmental and Natural Resource Sciences, 2015 Hand-held {{information}} and communication technology such as cell phones, Smartphones, satellite phones, personal locator beacons (PLBs) and Global Positioning System (GPS) units, have become a part our everyday lives for both informational and communication purposes. These devices influence the way we access and share information, the way we communicate with each other, and even the way we make decisions. As these technologies become more prolific, more people may bring them into the wilderness, affecting the wilderness experience and potentially influencing visitors??? decision-making due to a perceived increase in safety because of the relative ease of requesting rescue. Through methods of a wilderness use survey (n= 635) and personal phone interviews (n= 65), the study offers useful insight in how the PLB technology may influence wilderness visitors. Results show that wilderness visitors were able to enjoy the wilderness experience more worry and guilt free than they had without a device. Many {{said that it was}} an added precautionary tool, such as a first aid kit, flare gun or whistle, making them more prepared {{in the case of an}} emergency. One person compared it to wearing a seatbelt; the seatbelt increases the safety of the driving experience, and yet does not necessarily encourage the driver to take more risks while driving. We also found that carrying a device helped wilderness visitors travel without feeling guilty for causing their loved ones back home to worry about their safety. Solo travelers in particular, were able to enjoy the solitude of their wilderness experience more than they would have without a device. The only significant finding on how a device may influence risk-taking or decision making in the wilderness, was on the visitors??? decision to travel alone. Many people felt they would be more likely to travel alone if they had a personal <b>locator</b> <b>device.</b> The device theoretically would replace the need for traveling in a group. Those that consider themselves to be risk takers said they would be just as likely to do the same activities with or without the device. Hand-held technology, by influencing the wilderness experience and risk behavior of the wilderness visitor, will lead to inevitable changes in what defines wilderness (solitude, sense of self-reliance, primitive experience, meeting nature on its own terms, developing self-rescue skills). The knowledge gained from this research may well be applied in the development of best management practices and guiding principles for the appropriate use of technology in the wilderness...|$|E

Comparison between in vivo and in vitro results was performed for the measured value of impedance and for the components (Rp, Cp) of two element parallel equivalent circuit. It has been shown that normalized values obtained on apex have very similar frequency dependence, but the sensitivity to electrode displacement differs great in magnitude and its frequency dependence when measured in vitro from the one obtained in vivo.

40|$|The {{corrections}} {{system in}} the U. S. is supervising over five million offenders. This number is rising fast {{and so are the}} direct and indirect costs to society. To improve supervision and reduce the cost of parole and probation, first generation home arrest systems were introduced in 1987. While these systems proved to be helpful to the corrections system, their scope is rather limited because they only cover an offender at a single location and provide only a partial time coverage. To correct the limitations of first-generation systems, second-generation wide area continuous electronic offender monitoring systems, designed to monitor the offender at all times and locations, are now on the drawing board. These systems use radio frequency location technology to track the position of offenders. The challenge for this technology is the development of reliable personal <b>locator</b> <b>devices</b> that are small, lightweight, with long operational battery life, and indoors/outdoors accuracy of 100 meters or less. At the center of a second-generation system is a database that specifies the offender`s home, workplace, commute, and time the offender should be found in each. The database could also define areas from which the offender is excluded. To test compliance, the system would compare the observed coordinates of the offender with the stored location for a given time interval. Database logfiles will also enable law enforcement to determine if a monitored offender was present at a crime scene and thus include or exclude the offender as a potential suspect...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{influence}} of preflaring on the accuracy of 4 electronic apex locators (EALs) : Root ZX, Elements Diagnostic Unit and Apex Locator, Mini Apex Locator, and Apex DSP. Methods: Forty extracted teeth were preflared by using S 1 and SX ProTaper instruments. The working length was established by reducing 1 mm from the total length (TL). The ability of the EALs to detect precise (- 1 mm from TL) and acceptable (- 1 +/- 0. 5 mm from TL) measurements in unflared and preflared canals was determined. Results: The precise and acceptable (P/A) readings in unflared canals for Root ZX, Elements Diagnostic Unit and Apex Locator, Mini Apex and Apex DSP were 50 %/ 97. 5 %, 47. 5 %/ 95 %, 50 %/ 97. 5 %, and 45 %/ 67. 5 %, respectively. For preflared canals, the readings were 75 %/ 97. 5 %, 55 %/ 95 %, 75 %/ 97. 5 %, and 60 %/ 87. 5 %, respectively. For precise criteria, the preflared procedure increased the percentage of accurate electronic readings for the Root ZX and the Mini Apex Locator (P. 05).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} two-fold: 1) to determine the accuracy of the Elements Apex Locator and 2) to compare the accuracy of the alginate and Endo Q models as in-vitro apex <b>locator</b> testing <b>devices.</b> Twenty teeth were decoronated at the CEJ and triplicate measurements were made using the Elements Apex Locator. All measurements were made to the apex reading of the apex locator. True length was established by visualizing the file tip at the apex with a dental operating microscope. Measurements were then taken with the teeth mounted in an alginate model and then in the Endo Q model. The two models were compared using a repeated-measure ANOVA. Statistically significant differences occurred between the alginate and Endo Q models. The results showed that in 95 % (n= 19) of the cases, an accurate location to within + 0. 5 mm of the apical foramen was obtained with the Endo Q model and 55 % (n= 11) with the alginate model. With a + 1. 0 mm tolerance level, an accuracy of 95 % (n= 19) was found {{with the use of the}} alginate model. In conclusion, it seems that the Endo Q system was more suitable for testing the electronic apex locator than the alginate model.

40|$|Introduction: Determining {{working length}} is {{regarded}} as {{an important step in}} root canal treatment, for which electronic apex locator can be applied. New apex locators are preferred, since they work via applying alternating current. Furthermore, the two factors of dentin specific resistance and capacitance seem to be effective principles in their operating. Therefore, this study aimed to determine and compare the dentin capacitance in young and old teeth. Methods: In order to glean the study data, 60 human permanent teeth were collected consisting of 30 permanent teeth under twenty-five years and 30 permanent teeth over sixty year. The sixty samples of same dimensions were prepared from mid levels of the teeth roots. The capacitance circuit rates created in three frequencies of 100 HZ, 1 KHZ and 10 KHZ were measured. Moreover, in order to analyze the study data, ANOVA and Mann-Whitney tests were utilized. Results: The mean value of capacitance circuit teeth under twenty five years and over sixty years respectively involved 60 and 137 in 100 HZ, 2 / 5 and 9 / 5 in 1 KHZ and 0 / 05 and 0 / 3 in 10 KHZ, which this difference was proved to be statistically significant (P Value = 0 / 000) Conclusion: The study findings revealed a different capacitance between young and old teeth. Regarding the influence of this factor in the operating principle of apex <b>locators,</b> calibrate the <b>device</b> may be necessitated while applying it in young and old teeth. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Consider {{classes of}} signals {{that have a}} finite number of degrees of freedom per unit of time and call this number the rate of {{innovation}}. Examples of signals with a finite rate of innovation include streams of Diracs (e. g., the Poisson process), nonuniform splines, and piecewise polynomials. Even though these signals are not bandlimited, we show that they can be sampled uniformly at (or above) the rate of innovation using an appropriate kernel and then be perfectly reconstructed. Thus, we prove sampling theorems for classes of signals and kernels that generalize the classic “bandlimited and sinc kernel ” case. In particular, we show how to sample and reconstruct periodic and finite-length streams of Diracs, nonuniform splines, and piecewise polynomials using sinc and Gaussian kernels. For infinite-length signals with finite local rate of innovation, we show local sampling and reconstruction based on spline kernels. The key in all constructions is to identify the innovative part of a signal (e. g., time instants and weights of Diracs) using an annihilating or <b>locator</b> filter: a <b>device</b> well known in spectral analysis and error-correction coding. This leads to standard computational procedures for solving the sampling problem, which we show through experimental results. Applications of these new sampling results can be found in signal processing, communications systems, and biological systems.

40|$|Telecommunications {{metadata}} possess immense {{potential for}} societal good. Telecommunications metadata {{is therefore a}} vital ingredient for {{the making of a}} smart city, a city that responds to the socio-economic needs of its citizenry. Data sharing for the public good must therefore be encouraged in respect of retained telecommunications metadata, in addition to the existing law enforcement goals, to expand the benefits society may derive from telecommunications metadata. These benefits include assistance with humanitarian efforts, complementing the open data movement. In this paper we take an exploratory approach and analyze the mandatory telecommunications metadata retention and disclosure regime of Brazil. The aim is to learn how the framework addresses privacy and personal data protections. This regime is assessed with a view of identifying how it may enable and encourage the sharing of telecommunications metadata for the public good, beyond the law enforcement public service function. These outcomes are assessed with a view of proposing a predictable enabling policy and legal environment that allows for the collection, use and sharing of telecommunications metadata. The telecommunications metadata {{that is the subject of}} this paper are the uniform resource <b>locators,</b> and the <b>device</b> identifiers and location information. These metadata are assessed in light of the technical architecture vis-à-vis the terms of service of Facebook and Telefonica, as examples. Key issues are highlighted in terms of the status quo and its impact on data collection and sharing for the public good. One such key issue is how to practically obtain the lawful consent of the individual given the technical nature of the metadata and the individual’s ignorance to its operations and functions. An enabling environment may need to be based on a practical framework about the exact types of information the individual may need to be informed about and about which express consent is to be obtained, and what may not be practical. The purpose of collection and use may need to be described in a manner that allows for a dynamic innovation process which may not always lend itself to knowing beforehand what purposes the metadata may be explored for. The re-identification challenge may require a step by step approach, at every collection, use and sharing phase, to ensure better privacy protection along the way, in search for solutions to the humanitarian challenges faced...|$|R
