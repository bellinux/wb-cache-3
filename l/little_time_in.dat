5|$|In 1814, Egan (now {{bishop of}} Philadelphia) {{promoted}} de Barth {{to the position}} of Vicar General. Egan died shortly thereafter. Until a suitable bishop could be found, Carroll, now Archbishop of Baltimore, appointed de Barth as the apostolic administrator. De Barth tried to refuse this assignment, likely due to the ongoing disputes in Philadelphia between the clergy and the lay trustees of the city's parishes over who should control the churches, but he eventually accepted and took temporary control of the diocese. He spent <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the city, leaving day-to-day control of the parishes there to Terrence McGill, a local priest.|$|E
5|$|The {{final stage}} of the race was a flat stage that {{finished}} in Madrid. It was won in a sprint by Degenkolb. During the stage, Valverde took advantage of a puncture for Rodríguez and won the intermediate sprint {{to give him the}} points jersey. Although Aru lost a <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> a split in the peloton at the finish line, the rest of the standings were unchanged. Aru therefore won the race, his first Grand Tour victory.|$|E
5|$|After the Acts of Union in 1707 {{the royal}} family spent very <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>in,</b> or money on, Scottish palaces and many Scottish nobles {{followed}} the royal court to England, tending to invest in sculpture for their residences in London, rather than their estates in Scotland. With the growth of civic development there was an increasing demand for public statuary, often with the patronage of a public institution, such as the lead figure of George II at the newly founded Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh in 1753 or {{the figure of the}} judge Duncan Forbes for the Outer Parliament House in 1752. The portrait bust, designed for interior display, also became popular. By the middle of the century statuary were preferred to painted portraits among the aristocracy.|$|E

5|$|An Act of Parliament in 1857 {{provided}} {{for the establishment of}} a number of art schools throughout the United Kingdom and the Cardiff School of Art opened in 1865. Graduates still very often had to leave Wales to work, but Betws-y-Coed became a popular centre for artists and its artists' colony helped form the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art in 1881. The sculptor Sir William Goscombe John made many works for Welsh commissions, although he had settled in London. Christopher Williams, whose subjects were mostly resolutely Welsh, was also based in London. Thomas E. Stephens and Andrew Vicari had very successful careers as portraitists based respectively in the United States and France. Sir Frank Brangwyn was Welsh by origin but spent <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> Wales.|$|E
5|$|Barnum Brown {{recovered}} the first described remains of Saurolophus in 1911, including a nearly complete skeleton (AMNH 5220). Now {{on display in}} the American Museum of Natural History, this skeleton was the first nearly complete dinosaur skeleton from Canada. It was found in rocks of early Maastrichtian age, in the Upper Cretaceous Horseshoe Canyon Formation (then known as the Edmonton Formation) near Tolman Ferry on the Red Deer River in Alberta. Brown wasted <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> describing his material, giving it its own subfamily. Saurolophus was an important early reference for other hadrosaurs, as seen in the names of Prosaurolophus ("before Saurolophus") and Parasaurolophus ("near Saurolophus"). However, little additional material has been recovered and described.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the bombing}} of the Presidential Palace, North Vietnamese General Văn Tiến Dũng and his field commanders had been {{discussing}} the possibility of deploying units of the Vietnam People's Air Force (VPAF), to attack high-value South Vietnamese targets in support of North Vietnamese ground troops. Use of the Soviet MiG-17 fighter was considered, North Vietnamese pilots already had significant combat experience with the type. However, moving MiGs from their bases in North Vietnam was problematic; South Vietnamese defenses were falling much faster than anticipated, there was simply <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> which to deploy the MiGs in support of North Vietnamese units encircling Saigon. As the North Vietnamese had captured a large number of U.S.-made aircraft from the Republic of Vietnam Air Force at Pleiku and Da Nang Air Bases, it was decided to use captured aircraft instead.|$|E

5|$|The manor was {{inherited}} in 1514 by Henry Daubeney, created Earl of Bridgewater for {{his services}} to Henry VIII. He {{spent much of his}} time in France and <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> Somerset. He may have begun the new house, but he went bankrupt and was involved in the disgrace of Catherine Howard, Henry VIII's fifth wife. It is unlikely that much, if any, of the current building was his work. The house was forfeit to the crown and then had various owners including Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, who in 1552 sold it to William Clifton, a London merchant who had been assembling a Somerset estate. Clifton or his son John Clifton are thought to be responsible for most of the building at Barrington, possibly modeled on earlier work at Kirby Hall or East Anglian manors close to their roots at Kentwell Hall, Hengrave Hall or Channons Hall at Tibenham.|$|E
25|$|In his youth, Ražnatović {{aspired to}} become a pilot, as his father had been.

25|$|For Honduras, {{the period}} of {{federation}} had been disastrous. Local rivalries and ideological disputes had produced political chaos and disrupted the economy.

25|$|After the war, the Board wasted <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> modernising its fleet with diesel buses as {{they became}} available. They {{were used to}} replace all {{remaining}} tram services by years end 1954, and replace the trolley buses in 1956, as well as enabling {{the creation of new}} routes. The fleet became all-diesel in the 1960s and thereafter underwent occasional fleet upgrades, culminating in the Board's last purchase of M.A.N. buses in the mid-1980s.|$|E

Its first professional papers were published the year it opened. Neil Judd, Alfred V. Kidder, Sylvanus Morley, and Earl Morris were among the prominent archaeologists who spent time there, Judd and Kidder in particular contributing to the excavations of many of the same sites that had interested Hewett.|$|E

25|$|The {{resignation}} of general manager Hedley Jarman in October 1946 {{was followed by}} the appointment of John Fardell as his replacement. Fardell, having previously been employed at Reading Corporation Transport where he was involved in the replacement of trams with trolley buses, wasted <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> making his views known on the direction of public transport in Christchurch. He was in favour of the replacement of trams and trolley buses as they reached the end of their useful lives with diesel buses, {{with the exception of the}} Papanui–Cashmere route for which he favoured trolley buses.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the 10th century, a new dynasty of kings, the Capetians, {{founded by}} Hugh Capet in 987, came to power. Though they spent <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the city, they {{restored}} the royal palace on the Île de la Cité and built a church where the Sainte-Chapelle stands today. Prosperity returned gradually to the city and the Right Bank began to be populated. On the Left Bank, the Capetians founded an important monastery: the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés. Its church was rebuilt in the 11th century. The monastery owed its fame to its scholarship and illuminated manuscripts.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{stepping}} {{down from his}} position at the Normal School, Hewett decided {{that he needed to}} improve his academic credentials in order to advance. He earned a doctorate in anthropology from the University of Geneva in 1904. He spent <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> residence at the university, developing his dissertation mainly by collating a number of papers which he had written previously (a practice that, in the eyes of Hewett's many critics, would characterize and compromise much of his later writing as well) and having them translated into the required French. The resulting dissertation, bearing the title Les Communautés anciennes dans le desert Americain, was favorably received, and sufficed to earn Hewett his degree despite his inability to defend it in the customary French.|$|E

25|$|In 1949, {{seeing that}} the Chinese Communists, with the decisive support from Joseph Stalin, were gaining control of China, the Kashag {{expelled}} all Chinese connected with the Chinese government, over the protests of both the Kuomintang and the Communists. The People's Republic of China (PRC), founded in October 1949 by the victorious Communists {{under the leadership of}} Mao Zedong, lost <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> asserting a new Chinese presence in Tibet. In October 1950, the People's Liberation Army entered the Tibetan area of Chamdo, defeating sporadic resistance from the Tibetan army. In 1951, Tibetan representatives participated in negotiations in Beijing with the Chinese government. This resulted in a Seventeen Point Agreement which formalized China's sovereignty over Tibet, but was repudiated by the present Tibetan Government-In-Exile.|$|E
25|$|Elisabeth spent <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> Vienna {{with her}} husband. Their {{correspondence}} increased during their last years, however, {{and their relationship}} became a warm friendship. On her imperial steamer, Miramar, Empress Elisabeth travelled through the Mediterranean. Her favourite places were Cap Martin on the French Riviera, and also Sanremo on the Ligurian Riviera, where tourism had started only {{in the second half}} of the nineteenth century; Lake Geneva in Switzerland; Bad Ischl in Austria, where the imperial couple would spend the summer; and Corfu. The Empress also visited countries not usually visited by European royals at the time: Morocco, Algeria, Malta, Turkey, and Egypt. The endless travels became a means of escape for the empress from her life and her misery.|$|E
25|$|During Scott's {{first three}} years with Baltimore, he was a special teams standout. However, he saw <b>little</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the {{defensive}} rotation. In his rookie season, he played in all 16 regular season games and recorded five tackles and one interception on defense while tying with another teammate to lead the team in special teams tackles at 17. He made his NFL debut at the Carolina Panthers on September 8, 2002. The following season, he again played in all 16 games and one post-season game, recording nine tackles and one fumble recovery on defense. His 19 special teams tackles, a career high, ranked second on the team. In the 2004 season, he played in 13 games, making 17 special teams tackles, adding five tackles on defense playing as a safety and linebacker.|$|E
