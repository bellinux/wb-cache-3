40|$|Men {{with greater}} gender role {{conflict}} (GRC) tend to exhibit {{a variety of}} body image concerns, including a drive for muscularity (DM). In accordance with the theory of planned behavior (TPB), men {{with higher levels of}} GRC also report negative attitudes and a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>intentions</b> to seek help for problems. Additionally, prior research regarding other individual and contextual help-seeking related variables has shown that men with higher GRC report increased stigma of both seeking help and having mental health problems, as well as greater concrete barriers to help-seeking. In this study, 176 undergraduate men were assessed for GRC, DM, and help-seeking-related variables including attitudes, intention to seek help, self-stigma of seeking help, self-stigma regarding mental health problems, and concrete barriers to seeking help. Results indicate that GRC is positively correlated with DM and negatively correlated with help-seeking variables. Mediation analyses suggest a relationship between DM, GRC, and help-seeking. Specifically, results demonstrate that GRC mediates the relationship between DM and intentions to seek help, thus explaining why men with body image concerns may be less likely to utilize treatment. In addition, self-stigma of seeking help and attitudes toward seeking help emerged as mediating factors between GRC and intentions to seek help. Intervention strategies aimed at increasing help-seeking behav-ior for men who suffer from body image concerns, and disordered eating and exercise behaviors, may benefit from targeting stigmatization and attitudes toward seeking help...|$|R
5000|$|Involuntary manslaughter: (sometimes {{referred}} to as fourth-degree murder), a killing that stems from a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>intention</b> to cause death but involving an intentional, or negligent, act leading to death. A drunk driving-related death is typically involuntary manslaughter (see also vehicular homicide, causing death by dangerous driving, gross negligence manslaughter and causing death by criminal negligence for international equivalents). Note that the [...] "unintentional" [...] element here refers {{to the lack of}} intent to bring about the death. All three crimes above feature an intent to kill, whereas involuntary manslaughter is [...] "unintentional", because the killer did not intend for a death to result from their intentional actions. If there is a presence of intention it relates only to the intent to cause a violent act which brings about the death, but not an intention to bring about the death itself.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} in Australia {{has found that}} people with a mental illness experience higher mortality rates from preventable illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and diabetes compared to the general population. Lifestyle and other behavioural factors contribute significantly to these illnesses. Lifestyle behaviours that affect these illnesses include <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> physical activity, consumption of a poor diet and cigarette smoking. Research {{on the influence of}} these factors has been mainly directed towards the mainstream population in Australia. Consequently, there remains limited understanding of health behaviours among individuals with psychiatric disabilities, their health needs, or factors influencing their participation in protective health behaviours. This thesis presents findings from two studies. Study 1 evaluated the utility of the main components of Roger’s (1983) Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) to explain health behaviours among people with a mental illness. A clinical population of individuals with schizophrenia (N= 83), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) (N= 70) and individuals without a mental illness (N= 147) participated in the study. Respondents provided information on intentions and self-reported behaviour of engaging in physical activity, following a low-fat diet, and stopping smoking. Study 2 investigated the health care service needs of people with psychiatric disabilities (N= 20). Results indicated that the prevalence of overweight, cigarette smoking and a sedentary lifestyle were significantly greater among people with a mental illness compared to that reported for individuals without a mental illness. Major predictors <b>of</b> the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>intentions</b> to adopt health behaviours among individuals with schizophrenia and MDD were high levels of fear <b>of</b> cardiovascular disease, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> knowledge of correct dietary principles, lower self-efficacy, a limited social support network and a high level of psychiatric symptoms. In addition, findings demonstrated that psychiatric patients are disproportionately higher users of medical services, but they are under-users of preventive medical care services. These differences are primarily due to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> focus on preventive health, feelings of disempowerment and lower satisfaction of patient-doctor relationships. Implications of these results are discussed in terms of designing education and preventive programs for individuals with schizophrenia and MDD...|$|R
40|$|Governments in the {{developing}} countries are doing enough to ensure student's engagement in entrepreneurship activities {{in order to reduce}} the level of unemployment among graduates.

5000|$|In a 2012 study, over 1,000 {{females were}} {{surveyed}} {{to find out}} factors contributing to not using contraception. Of those surveyed, almost half {{had been involved in}} unprotected sex within the previous three months. These women gave three main reasons for not using contraceptives: trouble obtaining birth control (the most frequent reason), <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>intention</b> to have sex, and the misconception that they [...] "could not get pregnant." [...] In a study for The Guttmacher Institute, researchers found that from a comparative perspective, however, teenage pregnancy rates in the United States are less nuanced than one might initially assume. “Since timing and levels of sexual activity are quite similar across France, Canada, Great Britain, and the U.S., the high U.S. rates arise primarily because of less, and possibly less-effective, contraceptive use by sexually active teenagers.” [...] Thus, the cause for the discrepancy between rich nations can be traced largely to contraceptive-based issues.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "key plank of TerraNova's argument" [...] was the {{principle}} that the Court should select the interpretation that is most [...] "practical and sensible". TerraNova claimed that individual employers {{should not have to}} “shoulder the burden of rectifying society-wide structural discrimination” or “undertake assessments that are simply beyond their expertise and resources”. They argued that Parliament would have been clearer if it intended to impose such a significant burden on employers, and that the absence of guidelines was indicative of a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>intention.</b> TerraNova also relied heavily on s 9, which provides that the court “shall have power from time to time … to state … the general principles to be observed for the implementation of equal pay”. The Court felt, however, that s 9 was very open-ended. They considered its legislative history, which did not serve to clarify the section’s meaning, and consequently found that “it is simply not possible to read the Pay Act as a carefully drafted and well thought-out piece of legislation”.|$|E

Two possible reasons for the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> association between <b>intentions</b> and actual water conservation are that: (i) conservation behaviors are habitual and (ii) conservation behaviors and intention are measured at different levels of analysis.

The effects <b>of</b> <b>intentions,</b> habit strength, and their interaction were examined in single-person households where the alignment of theory and measurement were the same.

The main purpose of this thesis is to understand the moral and legal criteria for launching a military intervention for humanitarian aid in Syria followed by a detailed analysis of its ethical, normative and legal issues. The main theoretical framework of this study is just war theory. This study utilizes the criteria of Jus ad bellum principles, namely ‘legitimate authority’, ‘just cause’ and ‘right intention’ in order to asses the extent to which Syria fits into the framework of just war theory. This paper also applies legal criteria such as the Charter of United Nations and international law for the purpose of legal examination.
