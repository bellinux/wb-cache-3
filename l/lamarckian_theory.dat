Notwithstanding this silence, however, the transmutation theory, as it has been called, has been a [...] "skeleton in the closet" [...] to many an honest zoologist and botanist who had a soul above the mere naming of dried plants and skins. Surely, has such an one thought, nature is a mighty and consistent whole, and the providential order established in the world of life must, if we could only see it rightly, be consistent with that dominant over the multiform shapes of brute matter. But what is the history of astronomy, of all the branches of physics, of chemistry, of medicine, but a narration of the steps by which the human mind has been compelled, often sorely against its will, to recognise the operation of secondary causes in events where ignorance beheld an immediate intervention of a higher power? And when we know that living things are formed of the same elements as the inorganic world, that they act and react upon it, bound by a thousand ties of natural piety, is it probable, nay is it possible, that they, and they alone, should have no order in their seeming disorder, no unity in their seeming multiplicity, should suffer no explanation by the discovery of some central and sublime law of mutual connection? ...|$|E

Both Hayek and Boulding adopt a Lamarckian approach to social evolution.

Boulding uses the notion of noosphere of human knowledge, where learning transmits the noogenetic structure.

40|$|In this book, Noah Horwitz {{argues that}} the age of Darwinism is ending. Building on the ontological {{insights}} of his first book Reality in the Name of God in order to intervene into the intelligent design versus evolution debate, Horwitz argues in favor of intelligent design by attempting to demonstrate the essentially computational nature of reality. In doing so, Horwitz draws {{on the work of}} many of today’s key computational theorists (e. g., Wolfram, Chaitin, Friedkin, Lloyd, Schmidhuber, etc.) and articulates and defends a computational definition of life, and in the process lays out key criticisms of Darwinism. He does so in part by incorporating the insights of the <b>Lamarckian</b> <b>theories</b> of Lynn Margulis and Maximo Sandin. The possible criticisms of a computationalist view from both a developmental perspective (e. g., Lewontin, Jablonka, West-Eberhard, etc.) and chaos theory (e. g., Brian Goodwin) are addressed. In doing so, Horwitz engages critically with the work of intelligent design theorists like William Dembksi. At the same time, he attempts to define the nature of the Speculative Realist turn in contemporary Continental Philosophy and articulates criticisms of leading figures and movements associated with it, such as Object-Oriented Ontology, Quentin Meillassoux, and Ray Brassier. Ultimately, Horwitz attempts to show that rather than heading towards heat death, existence itself will find its own apotheosis at the Omega Point. However, that final glorification is only possible given that all of reality is compressible into the divine name itself...|$|R

As a result, he suggested, newly-acquired behaviours can be passed down to future generations − a biological proposition akin to the <b>Lamarckian</b> inheritance <b>theory.</b> He generalised this approach to assert that it explains many aspects of science, from evolution {{to the laws of}} nature which, in Sheldrake's formulation, are merely mutable habits that have been evolving and changing since the Big Bang.|$|R
5000|$|After World War II, many {{scientists}} were forbidden from cooperation with foreign researchers. The scientific {{community of the}} Soviet Union became increasingly closed. In addition to that, the party continued declaring various new theories [...] "pseudo-scientific". Genetics, pedology and psychotechnics were already banned in 1936 by a special decree of the Central Committee. On August 7, 1948, the V.I. Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences announced that {{from that point on}} <b>Lamarckian</b> inheritance, the <b>theory</b> that personality traits acquired during life are passed on to offspring, would be taught as [...] "the only correct theory". Soviet scientists were forced to redact prior work, and even after this ideology, known as Lysenkoism, was demonstrated to be false, it took many years for criticism of it to become acceptable. After the 1960s, during the Khrushchev Thaw, a policy of liberalization of science was implemented. Lysenkoism was officially renounced in 1963.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 In their modern context {{questions}} of heredity {{have come to}} be closely aligned with theories of evolution because all such theories require the presence of heritable variation. Thus the need for an understanding of a source of variation and a mechanism for its inheritance became very apparent with the general acceptance of organic evolution among biologists in the 1870 's. Yet no one theory of evolution or of heredity became generally accepted until the modern synthesis of the 1930 's. This thesis addresses the question of how this modern synthetic theory gained widespread acceptance and seeks to answer it by studying the development of a theory of heredity {{both before and after the}} rediscovery of Mendel ca. 1900. Those factors making possible the rediscovery in terms of the developments in heredity and evolution are treated as a background for the reception of Mendel. Theories discussed include those of Charles Darwin, August Weismann, Hugo de Vries and the American neo- <b>Lamarckians.</b> These <b>theories</b> also serve as a background against which to see the life and work of William Ernest Castle. This man was trained during the 1890 's, receiving his Ph. D. under E. L. Mark at Harvard. In 1900 he became one of the very first to begin Mendelian experiments on animal material, working with small animals. Castle's life and work extended into the second half of the twentieth century and his career, therefore, reveals much of the development of genetics in the United States. Thus his work serves as a focus for an understanding of the impact of the Mendelian research program on the biological community. Castle was important as a popularizer of Mendeliam, as a theoretician of sex-heredity, and as a mammalian geneticist. In addition, he did much to shape American genetics by his training of twenty Ph. D. geneticists at Harvard. The work of William Castle also included a lengthy series of selection experiments which served to elucidate the function of selection in evolution. The controversies generated by these experiments were very influential in leading many Mendelians to become Darwinian evolutionists and thus stand as a milepost in the development of the modern synthetic theory of evolution. Castle's position in history has been very tenuous because he was perceived as "wrong" in a number of controversies. But his work elaborated and clarified important principles of modern genetic and evolutionary theory. This thesis stands as a contribution to an understanding of the development of these theories by its focus on the work of William Castle...|$|R
50|$|Although <b>Lamarckian</b> <b>theory</b> was {{rejected}} by the neo-Darwinism of the modern evolutionary synthesis in which evolution occurs through random variations being subject to natural selection, the hologenome theory has aspects that harken back to Lamarckian concepts. In addition to the traditionally recognized modes of variation (i.e. sexual recombination, chromosomal rearrangement, mutation), the holobiont allows for two additional mechanisms of variation that are specific to the hologenome theory: (1) changes in the relative population of existing microorganisms (i.e. amplification and reduction) and (2) acquisition of novel strains from the environment, which may be passed on to offspring.|$|E

After breeding 6,983 guinea pigs {{over the course of several}} years, Durham found no evidence that daily doses of alcohol had any hereditary effects; the percentage of offspring born with genetic defects was no higher among the intoxicated guinea pigs than among the control group.

50|$|Miller {{held that}} the Earth was of great age, {{and that it had}} been {{inhabited}} by many species which had come into being and gone extinct, and that these species were homologous; although he believed the succession of species showed progress over time, he did not believe that later species were descended from earlier ones. He denied the Epicurean theory that new species occasionally budded from the soil, and the <b>Lamarckian</b> <b>theory</b> of development of species, as lacking evidence. He argued that all this showed the direct action of a benevolent Creator, as attested in the Bible - the similarities of species are manifestations of types in the Divine Mind; he accepted the view of Thomas Chalmers that Genesis begins with an account of geological periods, and does not mean that each of them is a day; Noah's Flood was a limited subsidence of the Middle East. Geology, to Miller, offered a better version of the argument from design than William Paley could provide, and answered the objections of sceptics, by showing that living species did not arise by chance or by impersonal law.|$|E
40|$|Paul David’s 1986 {{exposition}} on the QWERTY keyboard configuration {{gave rise}} {{not only to}} Stan Leibowitz and Stephen Margolis’s “Fable of the Keys”, but also to a consideration by Stephen J.

This study {{draws attention to the}} following issues from this debate: is it correct to attribute the operation of forces of change in evolutionary economics as being Darwinian in nature? How did evolutionary dynamics in economics come to be described utilising concepts and nomenclature typical of organic or biological evolution? It is suggested that it was the extension of Veblen’s advocacy of Darwinism as a “scientific methodology” which led to the adoption of Darwinism as an icon of evolutionary mechanisms, and gave rise to the invocation of Darwinian evolutionary mechanisms in economic theories. The basis for such invocation is reexamined and it is suggested the <b>Lamarckian</b> <b>theory</b> provides the more appropriate mechanism for evolutionary success or fitness in economic studies...|$|E
