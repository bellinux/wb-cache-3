40|$|AbstractFlexographic {{printing}} is a high-throughput rotational {{relief printing}} method and represents a promising innovative approach {{for the front}} side metallization of silicon solar cells. The ability to realize narrow contact fingers with very low silver consumption makes this technology particularly interesting for busbarless solar cells with wire-interconnection like Meyer Burger's SmartWire Connection Technology (SWCT). This study intends to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the general feasibility for this approach. Fundamental printing tests are carried out to investigate important influence parameters like the flexible printing plate and the correlation between printing pressure and contact finger width. We found out that contact finger elements on elastomer printing plates down to an actual width of wf = 7 ± 2 μm can be realized using a high-resolution <b>laser-engraving</b> process. Furthermore, we show that printed contact finger width increases by approx. Δwf ≈ 10 μm for each Δploc = 0. 05 MPa of pressure increase and thus has a strong impact on the contact grid. Busbarless Al BSF Cz-Si solar cells with flexo-printed front side metallization are fabricated and measured using Pasan GridTOUCH/SpotLIGHT-system. The best group of solar cells obtains a mean conversion efficiency of η = 19. 0 % and a maximum conversion efficiency of ηmax = 19. 4 %. A mini-module with the best two solar cells achieved a aperture conversion efficiency of η = 15. 8 %. Causes for cell-to-module losses are investigated and discussed in detail. In summary, we demonstrate the successful application of flexographic printing technology for the front side metallization of busbarless solar cells with multi-wire interconnection...|$|R

40|$|The {{fracture}} of highly mineralized natural {{materials such as}} bone, teeth, or seashells is largely controlled by the interfaces they contain. These interfaces, relatively weak, deflect and guide cracks into configurations which eventually impede their propagation. As a result, weaker interfaces turn brittle minerals into tough materials which can deform and absorb energy from impacts. To explore these concepts in synthetic materials, we used a 3 D <b>laser-engraver</b> to carve arrays of microcracks with well-defined geometries and toughness within the bulk of borosilicate glass slides. The microcracks, positioned along specific surfaces within the material, coalesce upon application of an external load and guide large cracks following the concept of “stamp holes”. Using this approach, we engraved curved interfaces with re-entrant features ahead of an incident crack in glass, defining jigsaw-like building blocks. After initial crack propagation along the weak interface, the jigsaw features produced {{a tremendous amount of}} toughness by pull out and interlocking, dissipating energy by friction. This powerful nonlinear failure mechanism, inspired by natural nacre, amplified the toughness of glass 100 x. Infiltration of the interfaces with polyurethane generatedadditional toughening mechanisms by ligament bridging, similar to the mechanism of proteins in hard biological materials. This additional step led to a material made of ~ 95 % of glass but 200 x tougher, as stiff as plain glass but displaying nonlinear deformations and failing at strains in excess of 3 %. This bioinspired glass not only shows how the powerful toughening mechanisms observed in nature can be harnessed in synthetic materials, but also showcase a new approach to making bioinspired composite materials by “fabricating” weak interfaces within stiff materials rather than assembling stiff building blocks within soft matrices...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{developed}} textile design method combining {{laser engraving}} and foil lamination was explored. With the foil laminating, {{the surface of}} denim fabric shows shinning effect. After that, the foil-laminated denim samples were treated with laser engraving by adjusting the parameters, including resolution (dots per inch, dpi) at 20, 30, 40 and 50 dpi and the pixel time (microsecond, μs) at 120 and 180 μs to melt and evaporate the aluminum foil and some surface fibers. The properties of the <b>laser-engraved</b> foil-laminated denim fabric, including weight, tearing strength, air resistance, surface observation, color appearance, colorfastness and abrasion resistance, and some low-stress mechanical properties, were investigated. The experimental results revealed that the changes in these properties are mainly related to the melted and evaporated surface laminated aluminum foil and different sizes of cracks, wrinkles and pores formed on the fiber surface with the increment of laser energy applied. This study also revealed the potential of pattern creation with different values and reflective appearance for the embellishment of denim fabric combining the aluminum foil laminating method through the laser engraving process. With lower resolutions, engraved vague patterns with small laser beam dots can be achieved. While the treatment resolution increased, clear patterns could be performed. Based on the same resolution, the higher pixel time can export more energy, which makes the pattern look more clearly.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{capillary}} effects in <b>laser-engraved</b> grooves filled with ordinary liquids and self-rewetting fluids, i. e. dilute aqueous solutions of high carbon number alcohols that show surface tension minima versus temperature. Two different geometries of grooves have been realized and investigated, with triangular and trapezoidal sections. The research activity {{has been focused}} on the experimental study of capillary rising in both types of grooves, using pure and self-rewetting liquids with well characterized surface tension and contact angle properties. In particular, self-rewetting fluids exhibit improved wettability, especially on aluminium surfaces, in comparison to water; {{this is a very important}} property to guarantee inflow into micro-channels. Using theoretical models available in the recent literature capillary rising has been predicted in the capillary structure for of the different fluids, including Ethanol and self-rewetting solutions of Water-Butanol at several concentrations. The experiments carried out using Ethanol show a good agreement with the theoretical predictions; on the contrary, in the case of self-rewetting solutions, higher values of experimental capillary rising eights are obtained. In the latter case, when evaporation occurs, the concentration of the more volatile component is reduced and the surface tension increases. This effect may be the main responsible of the higher capillary rising of the self rewetting solutions. In addiction, the difference in surface tension, caused by evaporation of the more volatile component, causes a Marangoni flow towards the region with a lower alcohol concentration. The coupled effect of increasing capillary pressure at liquid-vapour interface and the inverse Marangoni flow could justify the experimental results. Numerical simulations are carried out to explain the different phenomena...|$|E
