50|$|Large {{numbers of}} bird deaths are also {{attributed}} to collisions with buildings. An estimated 1 to 9 million birds are killed every year by tall buildings in Toronto, Ontario, Canada alone, {{according to the}} wildlife conservation organization Fatal Light Awareness Program. Other studies have stated that 57 million are killed by cars, and some 365 to 988 million are killed by collisions with buildings and plate glass in the United States alone. Promotional event <b>lightbeams</b> as well as ceilometers used at airport weather offices can be particularly deadly for birds, as birds become caught in their <b>lightbeams</b> and suffer exhaustion and collisions with other birds. In the worst recorded ceilometer lightbeam kill-off during one night in 1954, approximately 50,000 birds from 53 different species died at the Warner Robins Air Force Base in the United States.|$|E

50|$|Vening Meinesz then {{designed}} a new gravimeter, which the KNMI (Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute) built. The apparatus has two pendula {{of the same}} size hanging in a frame but moving in opposite phases. With mirrors and <b>lightbeams</b> the difference in amplitude of the two pendula is captured on a film. Vening Meinesz had discovered that horizontal accelerations (as by waves on a boat) had no influence on the difference in amplitude between the two pendula. The recorded difference then is the amplitude of a theoretical, undisturbed pendulum. Now it became possible to measure gravity more accurately. Vening Meinesz started with measuring gravity all over the Netherlands, for which a network of 51 monitoring stations was created. This became a success, which encouraged him to do measurements at sea. A perfected gravimeter, hanging in a 'swing', was designed. The experiment was successful.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this article, {{we present}} an {{effective}} system for detecting vehicles {{in front of}} a camera-assisted vehicle (pre-ceding vehicles traveling in the same direction and oncoming vehicles traveling in the opposite direction) during night-time driving conditions in order to automatically change vehicle head lights between low beams and high beams avoiding glares for the drivers. Accordingly, high beams output will be selected when no other traffic is present and will turn low beams on when other vehicles are detected. In addition, low beams output will be selected when the vehicle is in a well lit or urban area. <b>LightBeam</b> Controller is used to assist driv-ers in controlling vehicle’s beams increasing its correct use, since normally drivers do not switch between high beam...|$|R
5000|$|As the {{situation}} is modeled in finer detail, using the general principle of relativity, {{the concept of a}} frame-dependent gravitational field becomes less realistic. In these Machian models, the accelerated body can agree that the apparent gravitational field is associated with the motion of the background matter, but can also claim that the motion of the material as if there is a gravitational field, causes the gravitational field - the accelerating background matter [...] "drags light". Similarly, a background observer can argue that the forced acceleration of the mass causes an apparent gravitational field in the region between it and the environmental material (the accelerated mass also [...] "drags light").This [...] "mutual" [...] effect, and the ability of an accelerated mass to warp <b>lightbeam</b> geometry and lightbeam-based coordinate systems, is referred to as frame-dragging.|$|R
5000|$|In the system, the {{particles}} {{to be observed}} are dispersed in a liquid or gas colloid (or less often in a coarser suspension). The colloid is placed in a light-absorbing, dark enclosure, and illuminated with a convergent beam of intense light entering from one side. Light hitting the colloid particles will be scattered. In discussions about light scattering, the converging beam is called a [...] "Tyndall cone". The scene is viewed through an ordinary microscope placed {{at right angles to}} the direction of the <b>lightbeam.</b> Under the microscope, the individual particles will appear as small fuzzy spots of light moving irregularly. The spots are inherently fuzzy because light scattering produces fuzzier images than light reflection. The particles are in Brownian motion in most kinds of liquid and gas colloids, which causes the movement of the spots. The ultramicroscope system {{can also be used to}} observe tiny nontransparent particles dispersed in a transparent solid or gel.|$|R

40|$|The new {{flashlamp}} {{is tested}} and its condensorlens designed. The {{set up with}} a condensoriens of 40 (mm) is satisfactory for black and white photos. For pictures in colour a condensoriens of 21. 5 (mm) is needed. Four films with black and white photos are made to analyze the flow around the Brite 22 N blade. Some photos are unsharp, because the <b>lightbeam</b> was not parallel to the blades. The von Karman frequency is obtained for machnumbers ranging from 0. 4 till to 0. 95 and with or without air coming out off the blades. Above Ma &# 61 1 the flow is shocked and the von Karman frequency is not detectable. Without air coming out off the blades, the obtained Strouhalnumber is about 0. 37. The expected number ranges from 0. 1 till 0. 25. If air is blown out off the blades, {{the thickness of the}} blade is split in two parts by the flow. Therefore the calculated Strouhalnumber is too large if the thickness isn't corrected. The R. M. S. value of the differences in the lightintensity is caused by the vortices in the wakeflow and is recorded at Ma &# 61 0. 7 and at 1, 2, 4 and 7 (mm) behind the blade.
