5|$|Caradoc {{was back}} in action by 17 November when she participated in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight. This was a {{successful}} attempt by the British to intercept German minesweeping forces that were clearing British minefields in the North Sea. The 6th LCS screened the two light s of the 1st Cruiser Squadron during the battle together with the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron. The British lost the German minesweepers in the smoke screen laid by the four German light cruisers and pursued the latter ships {{for most of the}} battle, although they inflicted little damage in the poor visibility caused by the German smoke. Caradoc, being the rear ship in her squadron, fired the <b>least.</b> <b>She</b> did not score any hits on her opponents, nor did they damage her.|$|E
5|$|In Lindsay Lohan's Indian Journey, Lohan meets and {{interviews}} victims of human trafficking in Delhi, Kolkata and {{a village in}} West Bengal. They talk about the exploitation and abuse they have experienced, describing sexual slavery, physical abuse and difficulties in bringing their traffickers to justice. She also talks to a former trafficker and parents of trafficked children. One trafficked boy says {{that he can not}} go back home because his mother is ill. A mother who trafficked her daughter describes how her family did not have enough food, and how even though they never received the promised payments for her daughter's work, at <b>least</b> <b>she</b> was fed.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{scientists}} {{did not yet}} know the reason for Genie's fear of cats and dogs the Riglers used their puppy {{in an effort to}} acclimate her, and after approximately two weeks she entirely overcame her fear of their dog but continued to be extremely afraid of unfamiliar cats and dogs. Marilyn worked with Genie to help overcome her ongoing difficulty with chewing and swallowing, which took approximately four months. She also tried to help Genie become more attuned to her body's sensations, and in late 1973 Curtiss recorded the first instance of Genie showing sensitivity to temperature. Although Genie deliberately did the <b>least</b> <b>she</b> possibly could in both Curtiss' and the Riglers' estimation, throughout her stay her physical health substantially improved.|$|E
25|$|Curtain {{provides}} {{additional details}} on Hastings's family: He and Dulcie have {{two sons and}} two daughters. One son joins the Royal Navy, while the other and his wife manage the ranch after Dulcie's death. Hastings's daughter Grace {{is married to a}} British officer stationed in India. His other daughter, Judith, appears as a character in Curtain. Judith is Hastings's youngest child and his favourite, albeit the child whom he understands the <b>least.</b> <b>She</b> marries Dr. John Franklin, a medical researcher, and moves to Africa with him. In Curtains postscript Poirot suggests that Hastings should consider a second marriage with Elizabeth Litchfield, the younger sister of a woman who was manipulated into killing her abusive father by the novel's antagonist. Poirot notes that Elizabeth must be reassured that she is not tainted by her sister's actions and that Hastings is still not unattractive to women. Age is not specifically discussed for Hastings after the first book; he is said to be 30 in The Mysterious Affair at Styles, which would leave him at least 60 years old in the earliest setting for Curtain. That novel was published in 1975, though written during the war; it has no ties to a specific time, unlike most of the Poirot stories, and {{there is no mention of}} the war or of changes in automobiles or telephones that might set the decade from late 1940s to mid 1970s.|$|E
500|$|Geri Halliwell {{described}} the single as a [...] "big love song" [...] and [...] "a Spice Girl classic". Chisholm, in her 2008 appearance on Never Mind The Buzzcocks, commented {{that she thought}} the song was not good at all, and that at <b>least</b> <b>she</b> was against the release of any new material when the record company was trying to market the Greatest Hits release. She would later say [...] "Headlines grew on me, it really came in to its own when we toured it, and it really felt lovely on stage".|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} criticized {{by a variety}} of {{conservative}} and anti-abortion groups and publications, including the Family Research Council, The Heritage Foundation, and the Media Research Center, through its NewsBusters blog and Cybercast News Service. In an article for The Human Life Review, Mary Rose Somarriba dismissed the film as [...] "obvious propaganda". Katelyn Beaty, meanwhile, who reviewed Obvious Child for Christianity Today, wrote: [...] "While I ultimately disagree with Robespierre's political aims, at the <b>least</b> <b>she</b> has provided a sometimes funny, often tender portrait of many (though not all) women who face an unplanned pregnancy." ...|$|E
500|$|Also in 2009 she next co-starred as {{frequent}} flyer Alex Goran, opposite George Clooney, in Jason Reitman's comedy-drama Up in the Air. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times praised Farmiga's performance, {{stating that}} she [...] "is {{one of the}} warmest and most attractive women in the movies, or at <b>least</b> <b>she</b> plays one". She received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role, BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress, and her second nomination for the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Supporting Actress. On June 25, 2010, she {{was inducted into the}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.|$|E
500|$|Gary Susman of Entertainment Weekly was {{complimentary}} towards Jackson, {{concluding that}} she was [...] "all business, playing it straight" [...] in the episode. He reported that [...] "she makes a fabulous entrance and departs with her dignity intact". Charleston Daily Mail contributor Kevin McDonough wrote that in the season premiere episode [...] "FYI: I Hurt, Too" [...] of season seven, singer Jennifer Lopez appeared [...] "in a farfetched and laugh-free guest appearance. Tonight , it's Janet Jackson's turn. At <b>least</b> <b>she</b> has sitcom experience." [...] In her annual countdown of the best quotes of 2004, Amy Amatangelo of Knight Ridder included Will Arnett's line [...] "Like a Sicilian woman's eyebrows, we could not be kept apart". In March 2006, Entertainment Weekly named Jackson's guest spot as their number nine most memorable guest appearance on Will & Grace.|$|E

500|$|VanDerWerff deemed Spears' cameo [...] "totally useless," [...] {{criticizing the}} singer's [...] "flat, {{listless}} dialogue." [...] Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post graded her cameo a [...] "C," [...] commenting [...] "at <b>least</b> <b>she</b> didn't {{have to try}} to be funny" [...] as in her How I Met Your Mother guest-spot. Flandez was disappointed that Spears did not appear for longer, yet he concluded that given the acting demonstrated in her 2002 film Crossroads, it was better that the pop star did not. Conversely, Jenna Mullins of E! Online appreciated the fact that Spears did not appear as a background character, writing that she is [...] "best when she is playing herself", Stack felt her appearances were well-handled, [...] "with a nice level of restraint," [...] and Canning felt they were kept to a [...] "perfect minimum." ...|$|E
500|$|Actress Jasika Nicole {{was pleased}} that the writers decided to let her {{character}} discover Walter's secret, commenting [...] "Astrid finds out in a really emotional way because Walter lets it slip to her accidentally. I {{think that it was}} really nice for them to invite Astrid into the importance of that instead of keeping her in the dark. At <b>least</b> <b>she</b> knows that she's a part of this family and this affects her. I think she serves as a really important character in these later episodes because Astrid is kind of the only person that isn't directly involved with everything that is still on his side. She has {{to step up to the}} plate and be that comfort for him because if he doesn't have anyone there, he's basically going to regress and go back to the place, I think mentally, that he was in when he was in the mental institution. And of course we don't want that." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert Hilburn {{from the}} Los Angeles Times commented: [...] "Madonna {{represents}} a contemporary fantasy figure that revives the glamour, innocence and raw sexuality {{of many of}} Madonna's own teen heroes, including Marilyn Monroe and James Dean. Like the early Monroe, Madonna may portray a bimbo, but there she's clearly no pushover. Though the audience was on its feet throughout, it often seemed that Madonna was operating beneath her potential in this pop format. It's important to demonstrate that she can handle herself live, but the simplicity of pop concerts doesn't begin to tax her ambition or talent. In fact, she has so little to do other than express this aggressive, sexy attitude that the show seemed long at just over an hour. Heidi Sherman from Spin commented, [...] "The Virgin Tour was Madonna's first, yet it {{put her in the}} same league as Prince and Bruce Springsteen. It proved that Madonna was beyond real. And if her stage presence indicated she was more showgirl than musician, at <b>least</b> <b>she</b> knew how to gussy up her act for the postfeminist MTV age. Boy Toy? Not exactly. She was a bonafide pop star in the process of becoming a cultural icon." ...|$|E

It's a friendship, of a beautiful sort; and that's what makes them so strong. They're straight, they feel; and they keep each other up. It's doubtless she, however, who, as you yourself have hinted, feels it most." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{official}} website for The Office included three cut scenes from [...] "Blood Drive" [...] {{within a week}} of its original release. In the first 85-second clip, Dwight assures his office-mates that the blood taken in the bloodmobile will not be used in any [...] "ritualistic ways". Later, while giving blood himself, he asks the hospital employee, [...] "How do I know it's not going to go into a person who will later come back to kill me?" [...] The second clip was two minutes of extended footage from the singles party. Meredith talks about her husband leaving her for a garbage-woman whom her kids now consider their real mother instead of herself, and Dwight said he believes his soulmate, [...] "probably died 700 years ago in feudal Japan after having impersonated a samurai, or at the very <b>least</b> <b>she</b> lives somewhere outside the Scranton Wilkes-Barre corridor." [...] In the final 90-second clip, Dwight shows off his bobblehead doll collection to a woman, Creed tries unsuccessfully to pick up Lynne, and Dwight gets rid of an attractive male visitor who Michael fears could be competition. Dwight tells him the party is cancelled [...] "due to a death in the elevator".|$|E
500|$|Stunt {{coordinator}} and second unit director David Leitch {{compared it to}} a [...] "Jackie Chan hybrid of comedy and action." [...] Prior to the filming, Leitch organized a month-long boot camp in order to prepare Renner and Arterton (who said she was also glad that at <b>least</b> <b>she</b> could use her prior training that she received while studying at RADA) with extensive weapons, fight and stunt training. Janssen said she enjoyed [...] "flying", something that she always wanted to do, adding that despite her reputation as an action star {{it was the first}} film where she really had to do something physical (including suffering a minor accident on the set), because she could not use a double in the close-up scenes where she had the makeup on. During one of the scenes, where Gretel is thrown through a wall and falls down several meters, a stunt double for Arterton was dangerously injured when a nail got lodged in her skull close to the brain; Arterton said she initially wanted to do this stunt herself but Wirkola would not let her. Arterton herself suffered an injury when she sprained her ankle while running through the forest. Stunts for the more aggressive witches were done by New Zealander stuntwoman and actress Zoë Bell. Renner did practically all of his stunt scenes himself.|$|E
500|$|Although {{she hears}} nothing from Milda after their night together, she still expects to reunite with her dream man shortly, so she breaks off with Tonda, who storms the {{dormitory}} demanding his ring back. After {{listening to a}} speech by the housemother on the virtues of fidelity and commitment, she packs up her suitcase and arrives on Milda's doorstep in the big city, ready to resume their romance. Milda is not home, and she meets his parents, who {{have never heard of}} her and don't know what they should do with her. Milda comes home very late, and after an evening of comically painful tension and uncertainty, his parents decide it's only decent to put the girl up for the night on the sofa, requiring Milda to climb into bed with them in order to avoid any appearance of impropriety. Forman has described this famous scene: [...] "It’s a tight fit. The old man wants to sleep; the son would like to get thrown out so he can join the girl on the couch, but the mother runs the show and won’t tolerate any such filthy ideas under her roof." [...] Andula, kneeling outside the door of their bedroom, overhears the family squabbling, and when it becomes clear to her that she is not valued in the <b>least,</b> <b>she</b> breaks down in tears and, the next morning, returns to her home. She tells her friends about her [...] "wonderful" [...] trip to the capital and how nice Milda's parents were to her, especially his father, and then she returns to work at the factory.|$|E

500|$|Slant Magazine writer Sal Cinquemani {{compared}} the album unfavorably to In the Zone, saying that although Blackout [...] "scores well, and its hotness quotient is remarkably high, [...] isn't {{much of a}} step forward for Britney following 2003's surprisingly strong In the Zone, for which she received a writing credit on {{a majority of the}} songs (as opposed to a scant three here)." [...] Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club said Blackout [...] "counts both as a significant event and as a disquieting aberration that couldn't be more mysteriously manufactured or bizarrely ill-timed" [...] in which [...] "every song counts as markedly progressive and strange." [...] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian called it [...] "a bold, exciting album: the question is whether anyone will be able to hear its contents over the deafening roar of tittle-tattle." [...] He elaborated that when faced with a public image in freefall, an artist has two options: making music [...] "that harks back to your golden, pre-tailspin days" [...] to [...] "underlin your complete normality" [...] or [...] "to throw caution to the wind: given your waning fortunes, what's the harm in taking a few musical risks?" [...] Petridis commented that Spears opted for the latter and the results were [...] "largely fantastic." [...] Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times said, [...] "The electronic beats and bass lines are as thick as Ms. Spears's voice is thin, and as the album title suggests, the general mood is bracingly unapologetic." [...] Sanneh added that said Spears became a spectral presence in her own album, explaining that when compared to her previous records, [...] " [...] cuts a startlingly low profile on Blackout [...] Even when she was being marketed as a clean-cut ex-Mouseketeer, and even when she was touring the country with a microphone that functioned largely as a prop, something about her was intense." [...] Peter Robinson of The Observer stated that Spears [...] "delivered the best album of her career, raising the bar for modern pop music with an incendiary mix of Timbaland's Shock Value and her own back catalogue." [...] The Phoenixs Ellee Dean said the album [...] "may be more a tribute to the skills of the A-list producers who guided her through the disc than to any of her own talents. But at <b>least</b> <b>she</b> was smart enough to accept that guidance." [...] In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau gave the album a B+ and said that [...] "From 'Gimme More's 'It's Britney bitch' hiya to 'Piece of Me's single-of-the-year sonics, from 'Ooh Ooh Baby's 'feel you deep inside' to 'Perfect Lover's 'touch me there', this album is pure, juicy, plastic get-naked." [...] Blackout was ranked by Rolling Stone at number fifty on their list of the 100 Best Albums of 2007. The album topped Billboards Reader's Choice poll as the best album of the year.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{film critic}} Robin Wood Magnani's [...] "persona {{as a great}} actress is built, not on transformation, but on {{emotional}} authenticity... doesn't portray characters but expresses 'genuine' emotions." [...] Her style is notable by not displaying the more obvious attributes of the female star, with neither her face or physical makeup being considered [...] "beautiful". However, she possesses a [...] "remarkably expressive face," [...] and for American audiences, at <b>least,</b> <b>she</b> represents [...] "what Hollywood had consistently failed to produce: 'reality'". She was the atypical star, the [...] "nonglamorous human being", as her genuine style of acting became a [...] "rejection of glamour".|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, Susan Lucci {{responded to}} a casting call for All My Children. She {{initially}} auditioned {{for the role of}} Tara Martin. The [...] "character that we were all interested in was not Erica, but Tara," [...] said Doris Quinlan, the show's former executive producer. [...] "She was the sweet young ingenue — the one with all the problems that everyone was supposed to care about... I certainly couldn't cast [...] as a young, innocent, sweet little Irish girl. That's not what comes out. She's much more sophisticated – at <b>least</b> <b>she</b> gives that appearance. She was perfect to play Erica." [...] After a meeting with a casting director, they promised to call her back in six months. One of hundreds of people they called back in, Lucci progressed on from each reading of the part until she received the role. [...] "I saw the audition tapes, and she just stood out," [...] said Agnes Nixon. [...] "There was never a question, ever." ...|$|E
