5|$|Boletus pisciodorus {{is similar}} in form to Tylopilus tabacinus. Unlike, T.tabacinus however, B.pisciodorus has spores that are hyaline in mass, and dark {{yellowish}} brown rather than hyaline when viewed with a <b>light</b> <b>microscope.</b> Further, B.pisciodorus has a fishy odor that is apparent in both fresh and dried specimens.|$|E
5|$|The spores {{are seen}} ochre-brown in mass, but pale yellow when viewed with a <b>light</b> <b>microscope.</b> They are {{fusiform}} (tapered at each end), sized 8–10.5 by 3–4.5μm. The basidia (spore-bearing {{cells of the}} hymenium) are four-spored.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} appear brown. Viewing {{them with a}} <b>light</b> <b>microscope</b> reveals finer details of their structure: they are roughly spherical but end {{abruptly}} in a small point, their surfaces are covered with small, wart-like nodules, and their size is between 5.0–5.3 by 4.0–4.7µm. The spores are in amyloid, meaning they do not absorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent.|$|E

25|$|An {{electron}} microscope is a microscope {{that uses a}} beam of accelerated electrons {{as a source of}} illumination. As the wavelength of an electron can be up to 100,000 times shorter than that of visible <b>light</b> photons, electron <b>microscopes</b> have a higher resolving power than <b>light</b> <b>microscopes</b> and can reveal the structure of smaller objects. A scanning transmission {{electron microscope}} has achieved better than 50pm resolution in annular dark-field imaging mode and magnifications of up to about 10,000,000x whereas most <b>light</b> <b>microscopes</b> are limited by diffraction to about 200nm resolution and useful magnifications below 2000x.|$|R
40|$|<b>Light</b> <b>microscopes</b> can {{visualize}} structures down to 200 nm (or sometimes less) and are {{therefore the}} tool of choice to visualize cells, the basic unit of life. No longer do researchers peer through the microscope’s eyepieces and document their findings through drawings or on film, rather, digital image acquisition and motorized {{control of the}} microscope play a key role.  Modern <b>light</b> <b>microscopes</b> capture data on digital detectors and are often fully automated, providing computer control of fluorescence excitation and detection and sample positioning.  This {{makes it possible to}} automatically acquire multi-color three-dimensional time-lapse movies.  Moreover, accurate, sensitive detectors enable quantification of microscope images and are a key component of various strategies to improve the spatial and temporal resolution of the microscope. Here, we review modern biological <b>light</b> <b>microscopes,</b> discuss their components, and describe how these tools are utilized experimentally...|$|R
5|$|The ascospores {{produced}} by Polytolypa are , yellow to yellow-orange in color, with dimensions of 2.5–5 by 3–4μm. Viewed with a <b>light</b> <b>microscope</b> their surfaces {{appear to be}} smooth, but under scanning electron microscopy, they are revealed to be densely marked with punctures and small, hard, sharp projections. The structures that produce the ascospores are called asci. In Polytolypa they are numerous, spherical, and measure 9–10 by 12–13μm. Each ascus contains eight ascospores, which are released when the ascus dissolves away at maturity. The anamorph (asexual form of the fungus) resembles the genus Chrysosporium.|$|E
5|$|The spores of Bovista pila are spherical, smooth (when {{viewed with}} a <b>light</b> <b>microscope),</b> and measure 3.5–4.5μm. They have thick walls and very short pedicels. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, {{measuring}} 8–10.5 by 14–18μm. They are usually four-spored (rarely, some are three-spored), with unequal length sterigmata between 4 and 7.4μm. The capillitia (sterile fibers interspersed among the spores) tend to form loose balls about 2mm in diameter. The main, trunk-like {{branches of the}} capillitia are up to 15μm in diameter, with walls that are typically 2–3μm thick.|$|E
5|$|Alfred Eisenack's {{original}} {{description of}} the Chitinozoans placed them in three families, spanning seven genera, based on morphological grounds. Further genera were identified, at first on an annual basis, as time progressed. Since its publication in 1931, Eisenack's original classification has been much honed by these additional discoveries, as well as advances in microscopy. The advent of the scanning electron microscope in the 1970s allowed the improved detection of surface ornamentation which is hugely important in identification - as can be appreciated by {{a comparison of the}} images on this page. Even the <b>light</b> <b>microscope</b> image here is of far greater quality than could have been achieved earlier in the century, using poorly preserved specimens and less advanced microscopes.|$|E

5|$|Collected in deposit, {{like with}} a spore print, the spores of T.plumbeoviolaceus {{appear to be}} a light pink to flesh color. When viewed with a <b>light</b> <b>microscope,</b> they are elliptical, with smooth walls and {{dimensions}} of 9.1–12.3 by 3.4–4.5µm. The basidia (cellular structures that produce the spores) are club-shaped, and measure about 26 by 6.5µm. The cuticle of the cap (the pileipellis) is made of a tangle of smooth-walled, narrow, brownish hyphae. When stained in potassium hydroxide, the hyphal contents tend to form beads, while staining in Melzer's reagent causes the pigment to form globules. Cystidia are common in the hymenial tissue; they are swollen at the base and narrow at the apex (lageniform), measuring 30–40µm long by 7–9µm thick. Clamp connections are absent in the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} are white. Spores are cylindrical, smooth, hyaline (translucent), inamyloid, and measure 9–12 by 3–3.5µm. Pycnoporellus alboluteus has a monomitic hyphal system, meaning {{it is made}} of {{generative}} hyphae, which are thin-walled, branched, and narrow. Hyphae in the flesh layer are thin- to thick-walled, frequently branched, and measure 2–10µm in diameter, while those of the pores are roughly similar in morphology, but measure 3–5µm. Both forms have a thin incrustation on their walls that gives them a rough appearance when viewed with a <b>light</b> <b>microscope.</b> The hymenium (spore-bearing tissue layer) is 40–60µm thick, and has abundant cystidia, which are hyaline, and measure 7–9µm in diameter. They are cylindrical, thin-walled to moderately thick-walled, hyaline, have a septum at the base, and measure 60–120 by 5–10µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and have dimensions of 25–35 by 6–7µm.|$|E
5|$|Under a <b>light</b> <b>microscope,</b> {{the spores}} {{are seen to}} be smooth, {{elliptical}} to oblong in shape, with dimensions of 3–5 by 2–3µm. The basidia (the spore-bearing cells) are 4-spored, and have a narrow club-shape with dimension of 18–22 by 3.5–4.5µm. The gill cystidia are seen to stain blue when cotton blue dye and lactate are applied. The cap cuticle is made of an approximately 100µm thick layer of gelatinous hyphae that are about 2–4µm thick. The gelatinous hyphae are only present on the cap surface, not {{the surface of the}} stem; these local differences in cell structure explain the ease with which the scales are sloughed off the cap, but not the stems of the fruit bodies. The macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of the mycelia of this species grown in culture have been described in detail.|$|E

5|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} are a deep reddish purple-brown color. The {{use of a}} <b>light</b> <b>microscope</b> can reveal further details: the spores are oblong when seen in side view, and oblong to oval in frontal view, with {{dimensions}} of 10.5–15 by 6.5–8.5μm. The basidia (spore bearing cells of the hymenium), are 20–31 by 5–9μm, four-spored, and have clamps at their bases; there are no basidia found on the sterile gill edge. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) measure 15–30 by 4–7μm, and are flask-shaped with long thin necks that are 1–3.5μm wide. P.semilanceata does not have pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face). The cap cuticle is up to 90μm thick, and is made of a tissue layer called an —a gelatinized layer of hyphae lying parallel to the cap surface. The hyphae comprising the ixocutis are cylindrical, hyaline, and 1–3.5μm wide. Immediately under the cap cuticle is the subpellis, made of hyphae that are 4–12μm wide with yellowish-brown encrusted walls. There are clamp connections present in the hyphae of all tissues.|$|E
5|$|When {{viewed in}} mass, such {{as with a}} spore print, the spores appear to be white. Viewed with a <b>light</b> <b>microscope,</b> the basidiospores are 8–10.5 by 4.5–5.5µm, , smooth, and {{yellowish}} in Melzer's reagent. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are four-spored and measure 48–65 long by 6–8µm thick. Pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia (specialized cystidia found on the gill faces and edges, respectively) are absent in this species. The pileipellis (cap cuticle) is made of a broad (175–350µm) gelatinous zone, composed of loosely interwoven, slender (1.5–4µm) hyphae; the surface hyphae are a —a dark brownish-gray color. This hyphal arrangement is called an , in which the hyphal walls swell up and gelatinize, giving a translucence to the layer that stands out {{in contrast to the}} underlying flesh. The layer of gelatizined hyphae is tenacious, and may be peeled off the cap as a film. Although clamp connections are found on the hyphae that make up the flesh of the gill, none are found in the cap flesh nor in the pileipellis.|$|E
