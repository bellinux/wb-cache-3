The current study characterized the migratory behavior of a squamous cell carcinoma cell line (HaCaT-II- 4) upon E-cadherin suppression in both 2 D, monolayer cultures and within human skin equivalents that mimic premalignant disease. The migratory behavior of tumor cells was first analyzed in 3 D tissue context by developing a model that mimics transepithelial tumor cell migration. We show that <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> cell <b>adhesion</b> enabled migration <b>of</b> single, IE tumor cells between normal keratinocytes as a prerequisite for stromal invasion. To further understand this migratory behavior, E-cadherin-deficient cells were analyzed in 2 D, monolayer cultures and displayed altered cytoarchitecture and enhanced membrane protrusive activity that was associated with circumferential actin organization and induction of the nonmuscle, β actin isoform. These features were associated with increased motility and random, individual cell migration in response to scrape-wounding. Thus, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> E-cadherin-mediated <b>adhesion</b> led to the acquisition of phenotypic properties that augmented cell motility and directed the transition from the precancer to cancer in skin-like tissues...|$|R

40|$|In {{the network}} of {{chemokine}} signaling pathways, recent reports have described the SDF- 1 α/CXCR 4 axis {{and its role in}} cancer progression and metastasis. Interestingly, we found downregulation of CXCR 4 at both transcript and protein level in cervical cancer cell lines and primary tumors. We also found CXCR 4 promoter hypermethylation in cervical cancer cell lines and primary biopsy samples. DNA hypomethylating drug 5 -AZA- 2 ′-deoxycytidine and histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A treatments in cell lines reactivate both CXCR 4 transcription and protein expression. Cell adhesion assay demonstrated that autocrine SDF- 1 α promotes the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> cell <b>adhesion</b> while paracrine SDF- 1 α predominantly protects the normal cervical cells from <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> cell <b>adhesion.</b> Cervical cancer cell line C- 33 A having increased expression of CXCR 4 after TSA treatment showed increased cell adhesion by paracrine source of SDF- 1 α in comparison to untreated C- 33 A. These findings demonstrate the first evidence that epigenetic silencing of CXCR 4 makes the cells inefficient to respond to the paracrine source of SDF- 1 α leading to <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> cell <b>adhesion,</b> one <b>of</b> the key events in metastases and progression of the disease. Our results provide novel insight of SDF- 1 α/CXCR 4 signaling in tumor microenvironment which may be promising to further delineate molecular mechanism of cervical carcinogenesis...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of Porphyromonas gingivalis in the periodontal pocket {{and the high}} levels of gingipain activity detected in gingival crevicular fluid could implicate a role for gingipains in the destruction of the highly vascular periodontal tissue. To explore the effects of these proteases on endothelial cells, we exposed bovine coronary artery endothelial cells and human microvascular endothelial cells to gingipain-active extracellular protein preparations and/or purified gingipains from P. gingivalis. Treated cells exhibited a rapid <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> cell <b>adhesion</b> properties that was followed by apoptotic cell death. Cleavage of N- and VE-cadherin and integrin β 1 was observed in immunoblots of cell lysates. There was a direct correlation between the kinetics of cleavage of N- and VE-cadherin and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> cell <b>adhesion</b> properties. <b>Loss</b> <b>of</b> cell <b>adhesion,</b> as well as N- and VE-cadherin and integrin β 1 cleavage, could be inhibited or significantly delayed by preincubation of P. gingivalis W 83 gingipain-active extracellular extracts with the cysteine protease inhibitor Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethylketone. Furthermore, purified gingipains also induced endothelial cell detachment and apoptosis. Apoptosis-associated events, including annexin V positivity, caspase- 3 activation, and cleavage of the caspase substrates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and topoisomerase I (Topo I), were observed in endothelial cells after detachment. All of the effects observed were correlated with the different levels of cysteine-dependent proteolytic activity of the extracts tested. Taken together, these results indicate that gingipains from P. gingivalis can alter cell adhesion molecules and induce endothelial cell death, which could have implications for the pathogenicity of this organism...|$|R
30|$|Nanotopography-induced {{apoptosis}} shares {{some common}} features with anoikis, the apoptosis {{induced by the}} <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> cell <b>adhesion</b> [22]. Both events were initiated at the bio-nano interface. The <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> focal <b>adhesions</b> and organization <b>of</b> actin filaments were key features of both phenomena. However, anoikis is triggered by forcing epithelial cells to grow in suspension, and signaling is detectable in minutes to hours [23]. Nanotopography-induced apoptosis-like events became evident only after days of incubation. We noticed that cells seemed to lose adhesion when grown on the 100 -nm and 200 -nm arrays (Fig. 6). Serious deformation of cells was observed. The <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> attachment {{might be due to}} an imbalanced shear force caused by the uneven evaporation of solvent during the dehydration process. However, cells cultured on other nanodot arrays maintained decent adhesion with the surface, indicating that the cells grown on the 100 -nm and 200 -nm arrays exhibited relatively weak binding affinity to the surface. To exclude the possibility of anoikis, measuring the number of non-adherent cells at various time intervals will be performed in future experiments.|$|R
40|$|The plasma {{membrane}} of murine erythro-leukemia (MEL) cells contains a 140 -kD protein that binds specifically to fibronectin. A 125 I-labeled 140 -kD protein from surface-labeled uninduced MEL cells was specifically bound by an affinity matrix that contained the 115 -kD cell binding fragment of fibronectin, and specifically eluted by a synthetic peptide that has cell attachment-promoting activity. The <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> this protein during erythroid differentiation {{was correlated with}} <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> cellular <b>adhesion</b> to fibronectin. Both MEL cells and reticulocytes attached to the same site on fibronectin as do fibroblasts since <b>adhesion</b> <b>of</b> erythroid cells to fibronectin was specifically blocked by a monoclonal antibody directed against the cell-binding fragment of fibronectin and by a synthetic peptide containing the Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser sequence found in the cell-binding fragment of fibronectin. Erythroid cells attached specifically to surfaces coated either with the 115 -kD cell-binding fragment of fibronectin or with the synthetic peptide- albumin complex. Thus, the erythroid 140 -kD protein exhibits several properties in common with those described for the fibronectin receptor of fibroblasts.

40|$|The role <b>of</b> cell–cell <b>adhesion</b> in the {{transition}} from premalignancy to invasive cancer is not well understood. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine how abrogation <b>of</b> E-cadherin-mediated <b>adhesion</b> influenced early neoplastic progression in tissues that mimic human, premalignant disease. To accomplish this, E-cadherin function was abrogated in a human cell line representing an early stage in the transformation process (HaCaT-II- 4 cells) that was grown in three-dimensional, organotypic cultures with intact basement membrane. Before modification, this cell line showed a paucity <b>of</b> cell <b>adhesion</b> structures by ultrastructural and immunohistochemical analysis, whereas immunoblot studies demonstrated that expression and association of E-cadherin and catenins were not diminished when compared with normal keratinocytes. To further reduce functional E-cadherin, II- 4 cells were infected with a dominant-negative, recombinant adenovirus, expressing E-cadherin lacking an extracellular domain (AdECadEC). AdECadEC infection resulted in <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> endogenous E-cadherin and completely disrupted II- 4 cell adhesion, as seen by <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> β-catenin from II- 4 cell junctions in monolayer culture. In three-dimensional cultures, AdECadEC-infected cells demonstrated disruption <b>of</b> tissue architecture, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> cell–cell <b>adhesion,</b> and the invasion of individual tumor cells into the stroma. The induction of this invasive phenotype was associated with <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> basement membrane integrity, as seen by degradation of type IV collagen and laminin 5. These studies showed that <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> E-cadherin-mediated <b>adhesion</b> enabled acquisition <b>of</b> an invasive phenotype, suggesting that maintenance <b>of</b> intercellular <b>adhesion</b> and tissue organization plays a crucial part in suppressing the incipient stages of squamous cell cancer progression...|$|R

We have developed image analysis tools that do not require fluorescence tagging and that automatically track and characterize three aspects of scattering in live cells: increase in cell motility, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> cell-cell <b>adhesion,</b> and spatial dispersion of cells (the redistribution of cells during scattering). We used these tools to screen a library of drugs, and we identified several efficient inhibitors of scattering, which we classified as selective inhibitors of either motility or <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> cell-cell <b>adhesion,</b> or as nonselective inhibitors. We validated the inhibitors and putative targets from this screen in two unrelated model cell lines. Using pharmacological treatments and RNA interference (RNAi), we found that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibited cell-cell dissociation, that indirubins inhibited cell motility, and that cyclin-dependent kinase 1 and ribosomal S 6 kinase were signaling intermediates in HGF-induced cell scattering.

40|$|Denudation of the {{ependyma}} due to <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> cell <b>adhesion</b> {{mediated by}} cadherin-based adherens junctions {{is a common}} feature of perinatal hydrocephalus.

Here, we reveal that <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> the netrin/RGM receptor, Neogenin, leads to severe hydrocephalus. We show that Neogenin plays {{a critical role in}} actin nucleation in the ependyma by anchoring the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC) and Arp 2 / 3 to the cadherin complex. Blocking Neogenin binding to the Cyfip 1 /Abi WRC subunit results in actin depolymerization, junctional collapse, and denudation of the postnatal ventricular zone. In the embryonic cortex, this leads to <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> radial progenitor <b>adhesion,</b> aberrant neuronal migration, and neuronal heterotopias.

The solution seemed to be thyristor locomotive that had successfully been tested by ASEA and Canadian Pacific Railway with possibilities to pull 50% heavier trains than equivalent diesel electric locomotives were capable of. This was partly due to a system of dynamic slip control, where speed of traction motors was controlled and adjusted to avoid slippage and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>adhesion.</b> The Swedish Rc4 locomotives were tested on the Northeast Corridor with success and NSB also chose to try the units on the Bergen Line.

50|$|Since the series-wound DC motor {{develops}} {{its highest}} torque at low speed, {{it is often}} used in traction applications such as electric locomotives, and trams. Another application is starter motors for petrol and small diesel engines. Series motors must never be used in applications where the drive can fail (such as belt drives). As the motor accelerates, the armature (and hence field) current reduces. The reduction in field causes the motor to speed up until it destroys itself. This {{can also be a}} problem with railway motors {{in the event of a}} <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> since, unless quickly brought under control, the motors can reach speeds far higher than they would do under normal circumstances. This can not only cause problems for the motors themselves and the gears, but due to the differential speed between the rails and the wheels it can also cause serious damage to the rails and wheel treads as they heat and cool rapidly. Field weakening is used in some electronic controls to increase the top speed of an electric vehicle. The simplest form uses a contactor and field-weakening resistor; the electronic control monitors the motor current and switches the field weakening resistor into circuit when the motor current reduces below a preset value (this will be when the motor is at its full design speed). Once the resistor is in circuit, the motor will increase speed above its normal speed at its rated voltage. When motor current increases, the control will disconnect the resistor and low speed torque is made available.|$|E

40|$|The {{integrity}} of the endothelium is dependent on cell-cell adhesion, which is mediated by vascular-endothelial (VE) -cadherin. Proper VE-cadherin-mediated homotypic adhesion is, in turn, dependent on the connection between VE-cadherin and the cortical actin cytoskeleton. Rho-like small GTPases are key molecular switches that control cytoskeletal dynamics and cadherin function in epithelial as well as endothelial cells. We show here that a cell-penetrating, constitutively active form of Rac (Tat-RacV 12) induces a rapid <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> VE-cadherin-mediated cell-cell <b>adhesion</b> in endothelial cells from primary human umbilical veins (pHUVEC). This effect is accompanied by the formation of actin stress fibers and is dependent on Rho activity. However, transduction of pHUVEC with Tat-RhoV 14, which induces pronounced stress fiber and focal adhesion formation, {{did not result in}} a redistribution of VE-cadherin or an overall <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> cell-cell <b>adhesion.</b> In line with this observation, endothelial permeability was more efficiently increased by Tat-RacV 12 than by Tat-RhoV 14. The <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> cell-cell <b>adhesion,</b> which is induced by Tat-RacV 12, occurred in parallel to and was dependent upon the intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, Tat-RacV 12 induced an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of a component the VE-cadherin-catenin complex, which was identified as alpha-catenin. The functional relevance of this signaling pathway was further underscored by the observation that endothelial cell migration, which requires a transient reduction <b>of</b> cell-cell <b>adhesion,</b> was blocked when signaling through ROS was inhibited. In conclusion, Rac-mediated production of ROS represents a previously unrecognized means of regulating VE-cadherin function and may {{play an important role in}} the (patho) physiology associated with inflammation and endothelial damage as well as with endothelial cell migration and angiogenesi...|$|R
