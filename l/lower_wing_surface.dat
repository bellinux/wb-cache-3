5|$|Krueger flap and Natural Laminar Flow Insect Mitigation Test Program – Boeing {{commenced}} {{a series}} of test flights on 17 March 2015 with a modified Boeing 757, incorporating new wing-leading-edge sections and an actively blown vertical tail. The left wing has been modified to include a 6.7 m-span glove section supporting a variable-camber Krueger flap which will be deployed during landing and which protrudes {{just ahead of the}} leading edge. Although Krueger flaps have been tried before as insect-mitigation screens, previous designs caused additional drag; the newer design being tested is variable-camber and designed to retract as seamlessly as possible into the <b>lower</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surface.</b> Increasing the use of natural laminar flow (NLF) on an aircraft wing has the potential to improve fuel burn by as much as 15%, but even small contaminants from insect remains will trip the flow from laminar to turbulent, destroying the performance benefit. The test flights have been supported by the European airline group TUI AG and conducted jointly with NASA as part of the agency’s Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) program. While the left wing tests the Kreuger flaps, the right wing is being used to test coatings that prevent insects from adhering to the wing. Success here will {{open the door to the}} application of Natural Laminar Flow to reduce fuel burn.|$|E

40|$|A sensor for {{measuring}} water film thickness is evaluated. The test is {{conducted in a}} small flow apparatus with a 1 ft chord model wing in a water spray. Photographic and visual observations are made of the upper <b>wing</b> <b>surface</b> and film thickness is measured on the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The performance of the sensor appears highly satisfactory, and where valid comparisons can be made, repeatable results are obtained...|$|R
50|$|The Standard is an {{all-metal}} aircraft with a fixed monowheel landing gear. The prototype {{originally had}} wings with a 15 m span and dive brakes on the <b>lower</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surface.</b> The wing employs a NACA 63-618 laminar flow airfoil, an I-beam spar {{and has a}} semi-tapered planform.|$|E
50|$|In December 1919, {{the second}} {{prototype}} received its Dragonfly I engines, becoming the Avro 533A Manchester Mk I. Other than the different engines, {{there were few}} {{differences between the two}} types, other than the Mk I having a slightly reduced <b>lower</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surface,</b> and enlarged tailfin and rudder to correct control problems indicated in testing. Flight testing also indicated a lower performance than anticipated which resulted in Avro reconsidering the type's further trials, and eventually led to the abandoning of the third prototype, which was never fitted with engines.|$|E
50|$|Adults are purplish blue on {{the upper}} wing surface with a black body and black or brown wing margins. These margins are larger on the female than the male. The <b>lower</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surface</b> is brown to pale {{brownish}} grey with a pattern of fawn bands and spots, with the body covered in white or grey hairs. The wingspans of females are slightly larger than males, females having a wingspan of 23 mm and males 20 mm. Common grass blues have a weak, fluttering flight and so usually fly near ground level close to a food source.|$|E
50|$|Controls:Conventional {{control stick}} and rudder pedals {{operated}} the controls via pushrods. Roll and camber control were achieved through four full span differentially operated Duralumin skinned flaperons on the trailing {{edges of the}} mainplanes. Approach control was achieved through Göppingen type airbrakes on upper and <b>lower</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Wing loading could also be adjusted on the ground by attaching ballast to the wing roots.|$|R
50|$|Austria-Hungary {{produced}} 413 seaplanes {{during the}} war. These naval aircraft were more elaborately marked. Typically, a flying boat sported a black cross pattée on {{a box of}} white background for national insignia; the boxed crosses were found on top of upper <b>wing</b> <b>surfaces</b> both port and starboard, under both <b>lower</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surfaces,</b> and {{on the sides of}} the hull. Additionally, the rudder and elevators were blocked out in red and white; broad red and white bands were sometimes applied to the outboard ends of the wings also. There were also serial numbers on the hull.|$|R
40|$|Conclusions: The hot gases, having {{flooded the}} wing interior, quickly heated {{the upper and}} <b>lower</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{allowing}} the aluminum honeycomb facesheets and the wing tiles to debond. The thin-wall aluminum truss tubes would soon collapse and the aerodynamic and structural integrity of the left wing would be effectively destroyed. The forensic evidence {{is consistent with the}} observed External Tank foam impact 81 seconds into launch. This is the most probable cause of the damage to the Reinforced Carbon-Carbon.

50|$|The Pegasus had a rectangular-section, ply-covered {{fuselage}}, which tapered {{towards the}} tail. The wing was braced above the fuselage by the struts and the open, unscreened cockpit {{was under the}} leading edge; fabric-covered, inverted V-shaped decking tapered from the <b>lower</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surface</b> rearwards. There was a short, curved landing skid fixed at the nose and joined to the lower longerons {{at the same point}} as the lift struts by a V-form pair of telescopic compression struts. Initially the Pegasus had a tailskid but flight trials showed that both skids were easily broken, so the main skid was replaced with a stiffer one and the tailskid by a rubber tailwheel.|$|E

40|$|A {{download}} reduction technique using spanwise {{plates on}} the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surfaces</b> has been examined. Experimental and analytical techniques {{were used to determine}} the download reduction obtained using this technique. Simple two-dimensional wind tunnel testing confirmed the validity of the technique for reducing two-dimensional airfoil drag. Computations using a two-dimensional Navier-Stokes analysis provided insight into the mechanism causing the drag reduction. Finally, the download reduction technique was tested using a rotor and wing to determine the benefits for a semispan configuration representative of a tilt rotor aircraft...|$|R
50|$|The S-1 was {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} two-seater, but was switched to a single place design to make production costs lower. The two cylinder engine was designed in-house by Anthony Stadlman. The fuselage was built using an all-wood, multi-layer monocoque laid up in concrete molds. The process would be later applied to the larger and more famous Lockheed Vega aircraft. The wings folded {{along the side of the}} aircraft for storage. Roll control was via a system that pivoted the entire <b>lower</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> They also could be pivoted a full 90 degrees as a massive air brake.|$|R
5000|$|When an {{aircraft}} flies at a ground level approximately {{at or below}} {{the length of the}} aircraft's wingspan or helicopter's rotor diameter, there occurs, depending on airfoil and aircraft design, an often noticeable ground effect. This is caused primarily by the ground interrupting the wingtip vortices and downwash behind the wing. When a wing is flown very close to the ground, wingtip vortices are unable to form effectively due to the obstruction of the ground. The result is lower induced drag, which increases the speed and lift of the aircraft.A wing generates lift by deflecting the oncoming airmass (relative wind) downward. The deflected or [...] "turned" [...] flow of air creates a resultant force on the wing in the opposite direction (Newton's 3rd law). The resultant force is identified as lift. Flying close to a surface increases air pressure on the <b>lower</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surface,</b> nicknamed the [...] "ram" [...] or [...] "cushion" [...] effect, and thereby improves the aircraft lift-to-drag ratio. The lower/nearer the wing is with regards to the ground, the more pronounced the ground effect becomes. While in the ground effect, the wing requires a lower angle of attack to produce the same amount of lift. If the angle of attack and velocity remain constant, an increase in the lift coefficient ensues, which accounts for the [...] "floating" [...] effect. Ground effect also alters thrust versus velocity, where reduced induced drag requires less thrust {{in order to maintain the}} same velocity.|$|E
50|$|The Góbé is of predominately {{aluminium}} monocoque construction. The wings have a metal D-box {{ahead of}} a single main spar, covered in corrugated metal, aft of the spar they are covered in doped fabric. The wing has a modified a Goettingen 549 airfoil; the perforated Schempp-Hirth air brakes extend from the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surface.</b> The slatted Frise ailerons are covered in doped fabric. The stiffness of the corrugated metal leading edge provides high structural strength for the wings, enabling Rubik to omit extra ribs and rivets. This resulted in lower production costs and lower empty weight compared to other two-seater gliders typical of that era. The landing gear consists of a fixed monowheel and a tail skid. The V-tail of the first prototype was judged unsuitable for training and was replaced on the second prototype and production aircraft by a conventional unit. All the leading edges on the empennage are made of corrugated metal, the control surfaces are covered in doped fabric. The rudder is notably large and effective, its upper part serves as an aerodynamic servo, reducing the necessary operating force. The control force is transferred to the control surfaces via pushrods, except for the trim tab (mounted on the right elevator), which uses bowden cables. The instructor seat is not equipped with instruments; the rear seat is raised {{in order to give}} the instructor a view on the instruments mounted in front of the student. A separate rear seat instrument kit was available as optional equipment, making the glider capable for instrument (IFR) training.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{heat pipes}} is being {{considered}} {{as a means of}} reducing the peak temperature and large thermal gradients at the leading edges of reentry vehicles and hypersonic aircraft and in nuclear reactors. In the basic cooling concept, the heat pipe covers the leading edge, a portion of the <b>lower</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surface,</b> and a portion of the upper wing surface. Aerodynamic heat is mainly absorbed at the leading edge and transported through the heat pipe to the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surface,</b> where it is rejected by thermal radiation and convection. Basic governing equations are written to determine the startup, transient, and steady state performance of a haet pipe which has initially frozen alkali-metal as the working fluid...|$|E
25|$|Construction {{was entirely}} of wood with fabric {{covering}} {{on the wings}} aft of the mainspar. The pilot and instructor sat in tandem, with the student forward of the wings and the instructor immediately aft of the mainspar in the wing centre-section. The seating arrangement allowed the aircraft to be flown {{with one or two}} pilots without the need for ballast to adjust the centre of gravity. A single mainwheel with nose and tailskids comprised the undercarriage, with the aircraft sitting nose down on the nose skid with the front cockpit occupied. Large DFS style airbrakes extended from upper and <b>lower</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surfaces</b> aft of the mainspars.|$|R
50|$|Given {{the company}} {{designation}} L4, {{one of the}} few homegrown designs was the Albatros G.I a four-engined heavy bomber inspired by the Sikorsky Ilya Muromets. The G.I was of typical construction for 1915, with wooden structure, wire-braced and covered with fabric and four engines mounted in nacelles on the <b>lower</b> <b>wing</b> upper <b>surface.</b>|$|R
40|$|Two- and {{three-dimensional}} computational {{methods were}} used to design a wing for a transonic corporate transport that had significant runs of laminar flow on both upper and <b>lower</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surfaces</b> at the cruise condition. The airfoil was derived from a low-speed laminar-flow section. The contour was systematically modified based on results from a two-dimensional transonic code to give favorable pressure gradients to 50 -percent chord on the upper surface and 65 -percent chord on the lower surface. Three-dimensional transonic codes {{were used to}} determine the wing twist and to evaluate the aerodynamic characteristics of the complete configuration at various flight conditions. A leading-edge modification for improved stall characteristics was also designed. The theoretical pressure distributions for the final airfoil correlated well with results from wind-tunnel tests...|$|R
40|$|Bolted {{specimens}} {{representative of}} both upper and <b>lower</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surface</b> splices of a transport aircraft were designed and manufactured for static and random load tension and compression fatigue testing including ground-air-ground load reversals. The specimens were fabricated with graphite-epoxy composite material. Multiple {{tests were conducted}} at various load levels {{and the results were}} used as input to a statistical wearout model. The statically designed specimens performed very well under highly magnified fatigue loadings. Two large panels, one tension and compression, were fabricated for testing by NASA-LRC...|$|E
40|$|Concepts and {{technologies}} described herein {{provide for a}} low noise aircraft wing slat system. According to {{one aspect of the}} disclosure provided herein, a cove-filled wing slat is used in conjunction with a moveable panel rotatably attached to the wing slat to provide a high lift system. The moveable panel rotates upward against the rear surface of the slat during deployment of the slat, and rotates downward to bridge a gap width between the stowed slat and the <b>lower</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surface,</b> completing the continuous outer mold line shape of the wing, when the cove-filled slat is retracted to the stowed position...|$|E
40|$|Experimental oil-flow and tuft {{patterns}} and vapor-screen flow-visualization {{data were obtained}} on a cambered wing model at Mach = 1. 62 for an angle-of attack range of 0 - 14 deg. These data were used as flow diagnostic tools along with surface-pressure and force data and full-potential theory calculations. A large separation bubble {{was found on the}} <b>lower</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surface</b> at low angle of attack. The high-angle-of-attack flowfield was characterized by a large attached-flow leading-edge expansion followed by a crossflow shock. At alpha = 14 deg the crossflow shock apparently induced discrete regions of streamwise separated flow, which were clearly indicated in the vapor-screen and oil-flow photographs...|$|E
40|$|The DAST Aeroelastic Research Wing {{had been}} {{previously}} in the NASA Langley TDT and an unusual instability boundary was predicted based upon supercritical response data. Contrary to the predictions, no instability was found during the present test. Instead a region of high dynamic wing response was observed which reached a maximum value between Mach numbers 0. 92 and 0. 93. The amplitude of the dynamic response increased directly with dynamic pressure. The reponse appears {{to be related to}} chordwise shock movement in conjunction with flow separation and reattachment on the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The onset of flow separation coincided with the occurrence of strong shocks on a surface. A controller was designed to suppress the wing response. The control law attenuated the response as compared with the uncontrolled case and added a small but significant amount of damping for the lower density condition...|$|R
5000|$|For {{domestic}} use, {{powered by}} 13,500 lb (60.5 kN) Pratt & Whitney JT3C-6 turbojets with water injection. The initial DC-8-11 model had the original, high-drag wingtips {{and all were}} converted to DC-8-12 standard. The DC-8-12 had the new wingtips and leading-edge slots, 80 inches long between the engines on each wing and 34 inches long inboard of the inner engines. These unique devices were covered by doors on the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surfaces</b> that opened for low speed flight and closed for cruise. The maximum weight increased from 265000 to 273000 lb. 28 DC-8-10s were built. This model was originally named [...] "DC-8A" [...] until the series 30 was introduced. 29 built, 22 for United and 6 for Delta, plus the prototype. By the mid sixties United had converted 15 of its 20 surviving aircraft to DC-8-20 standard and the other 5 to -50s. Delta converted its 6 to DC-8-50s.|$|R
50|$|One of the then-innovative {{features}} {{to be used}} by the V-1000 was its adoption of the Rolls-Royce Conway engine, the world's first turbofan engine. During takeoff, the Conway's power was to have been boosted by water-methanol injection, of which the aircraft was to carry 550 gallons within the inner wing root. Additionally, uprated versions of the Conway engine were under development, which would have been available for use on the V-1000. The flying controls of the wing consisted of multiple flaps, the inner set of which being single-slotted and the outer pair being double-slotted, two-section independently operated ailerons, and multi-section dive brakes set across various locations of the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The tail surfaces were conventional and adopted a similar shape to that used for the wing; the tailplanes had a pronounced dihedral to keep them clear of the jet exhaust. The elevators were split into four separate sections while the rudder was divided into three separately-controlled pieces.|$|R
40|$|The N-factor {{method has}} been used to analyse 10 run points of {{previous}} S 1 Ma wind tunnel experiments with a HLF half wing model according to the incompressible stability theory without surface curvature terms. In the experiments suction up to 0. 25 m/s had been applied individually to totally 15 chambers within the first 12. 5 % of chord on upper as well <b>lower</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surface.</b> According to DLR's practice to correlate the instability behaviour of traveling waves (Tollmien-Schlichting) and standing waves (Cross Flow) DLR was involved in the strategy methods 2 : The fixed frequency and fixed propagation direction and 4 : The fixed frequency and fixed wavelength. Furthermore the instability in the whole wave propagation sector between local main flow and cross flow direction for all 10 tests has been assessed...|$|E
40|$|Highlight {{results are}} {{presented}} from subsonic and transonic pressure measurement studies conducted in the Langley Transonic Dynamics Tunnel on a supercritical wing model representative of an energy efficient transport design. Steady- and unsteady-pressure data were acquired on the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surface</b> at an off-design Mach number of 0. 60 and at the design Mach number of 0. 78, for a Reynolds number of 2. 2 x 10 (6) (based on the wing average chord). The model configuration consisted of a sidewall-Mounted half-body fuselage and a semi-span wing with an aspect ratio of 10. 76, a leading-edge sweepback angle of 28. 8 degrees, and supercritical airfoil sections. The wing is instrumented with 252 static pressure orifices and 164 dynamic pressure gages. Model test variables included wing angle of attack, control-surface mean deflection angle, control-surface oscillating deflection angle and frequency, and phasing between oscillating leading-edge and trailing-edge controls when used together...|$|E
40|$|In a {{joint effort}} ONERA and DLR have {{assessed}} the interference effects of a generic twin-engine transport aircraft configuration equipped with through-flow nacelle. Both experimental and theoretical investigations were performed. The {{results showed that the}} installation of the nacelles had substantial effects on total forces at cruise Mach number. With respect to the clean configuration, total lift decreased at constant incidence, and total drag increased at constant lift. A detailed analysis of the flowfield revealed that for transonic flows the installation of the nacelle influenced the complete upper wing surface. On the <b>lower</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surface</b> the flow was considerably accelerated due to the propulsion system, and a supersonic region terminated by a shock wave appeared. The nacelle pressure distribution was also substan- tially influenced by interference effects. Comparison of experi- mental and numerical results showed that the solution of the Euler equations is well capable of simulating the interference effects...|$|E
5000|$|Because of {{the revised}} {{induction}} arrangements of the Merlin 130 series, the supercharger and carburettor air intakes {{could be placed}} in the leading edges of the wings, outboard of the nacelles. (Other versions of the Merlin, which used [...] "updraft" [...] induction arrangements, required that the intakes be placed in a duct below the main engine cowling). The main radiators were also mounted in the inboard leading edges of the wings. Internal fuel, to a maximum capacity of 432 Imp gal (1,964 l) (F.3) was stored in four self-sealing wing tanks, which were reached through detachable panels forming part of the <b>lower</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> To assist airflow over the wing, the engine nacelles were mounted low, which meant that the undercarriage legs were reasonably short and the pilot's field of view was improved. The single-legged undercarriage units were simpler and cleaner than those of the Mosquito, using the same de Havilland-developed, rubber-in-compression energy absorption system. The main wheels were also smaller and lighter.|$|R
40|$|Flapping wing {{efficiency}} {{is limited by}} flow separation effects. The time dependent development of a leading edge vortex (LEV) during rapid pitch-up motion of a retreating helicopter roter blade is known as dynamic stall vortex. Movement of this vortex along the airfoil upper surface first increases lift but later the vortex lifts off the airfoil surface causing streng drag rise, severe nose-down pitching moments, and possibly negative aerodynamic damping. Very similar effects can be observed on flapping airfoils and wings experiencing combined plunging (heaving) motion and pitching motion. With increasing plunge amplitude the flow on the flapping wing starts to separate and concentrated dynamic stall vortices may develop on both upper and <b>lower</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Under these conditions it is shown that wing propulsion {{efficiency is}} considerably reduced. Recent investigations of dynamic stall control have shown that a streng vortex may be avoided by appropriate airfoil deformation. lt will be shown in the present paper that with dynamic airfoil deformation the propulsion efficiency can be improved considerably. The validity of the numerical calcu lations is first tested against existing data from literature...|$|R
