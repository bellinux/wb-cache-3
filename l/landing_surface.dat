The airline marketed itself with having a much more central airport than SAS, allowing for shorter travel times than those traveling via Værnes. The lack of a hard <b>landing</b> <b>surface</b> caused seasonal disruptions in operations and in rainy periods Braathens SAFE had to reroute its services to Værnes. As the aircraft also had to use visual flight rules, during foggy weather it was also forced to land at Værnes. During the period that Braathens operated at Lade, it had the responsibility for local air traffic control. Passengers were checked in at the reception of Hotel Astoria in the city center and then bused to the airport. At first there were three weekly round services, increasing to a daily except Saturday service from May 1954. The route had 3900 in 1953. Braathens moved their Lade services to Værnes in 1956, as Lade {{was not able to}} accommodate their new, larger Fokker F-27 Friendship aircraft.|$|E

40|$|<b>Land</b> <b>surface</b> albedo is an {{essential}} parameter for monitoring global/regional climate and <b>land</b> <b>surface</b> energy balance. Although many {{studies have been conducted}} on global or regional <b>land</b> <b>surface</b> albedo using various remote sensing data over the past few decades, <b>land</b> <b>surface</b> albedo product with a high spatio–temporal resolution is currently very scarce. This paper proposes a method for deriving <b>land</b> <b>surface</b> albedo with a high spatio–temporal resolution (space: 30 m and time: 2 – 4 days). The proposed method works by combining the <b>land</b> <b>surface</b> reflectance data at 30 m spatial resolution obtained from the charge-coupled devices in the Huanjing- 1 A and - 1 B (HJ- 1 A/B) satellites with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) <b>land</b> <b>surface</b> bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) parameters product (MCD 43 A 1), which is at a spatial resolution of 500 m. First, the <b>land</b> <b>surface</b> BRDF parameters for HJ- 1 A/B <b>land</b> <b>surface</b> reflectance with a spatial–temporal resolutions of 30 m and 2 – 4 day are calculated {{on the basis of the}} prior knowledge from the MODIS BRDF product; then, the calculated high resolution BRDF parameters are integrated over the illuminating/viewing hemisphere to produce the white- and black-sky albedos at 30 m resolution. These results form the basis for the final <b>land</b> <b>surface</b> albedo derivation by accounting for the proportion of direct and diffuse solar radiation arriving at the ground. The albedo retrieved by this novel method is compared with MODIS <b>land</b> <b>surface</b> albedo products, as well as with ground measurements.

In particular, relative gains in forecast skill for temperature of 10 %- 20 % within the first 30 days of the forecast {{can be attributed to}} the <b>land</b> <b>surface</b> initialization method using offline states. For precipitation there is no distinct preference for the <b>land</b> <b>surface</b> initialization method, with limited gains in forecast skill irrespective of the lead time. The authors evaluated the asymmetry between maximum and minimum temperatures and found that maximum temperatures had the largest gains in relative forecast skill, exceeding 20 % in some regions. These results were statistically significant at the 98 % confidence level at up to 60 days into the forecast period. For minimum temperature, using reanalyses to initialize the <b>land</b> <b>surface</b> contributed to relative gains in forecast skill, reaching 40 % in parts of the domain that were statistically significant at the 98 % confidence level. The contrasting impact of the <b>land</b> <b>surface</b> initialization method between maximum and minimum temperature was associated with different soil moisture coupling mechanisms.

It controls the partitioning of available energy at the surface between sensible and latent heat, and it controls the partitioning of available water between evaporation and runoff. The <b>land</b> <b>surface</b> is also the location of the terrestrial carbon sink. Evidence is increasing that the influence of the <b>land</b> <b>surface</b> is significant on climate and that changes in the <b>land</b> <b>surface</b> can influence regional- to global-scale climate on time scales from days to millennia. Further, there is now a suggestion that the terrestrial carbon sink may decrease as global temperatures increase as a consequence of rising CO 2 levels. This paper provides the theoretical background that explains why the <b>land</b> <b>surface</b> should {{play a central role in}} climate. It also provides evidence, sourced from climate model experiments, that the <b>land</b> <b>surface</b> is of central importance.
