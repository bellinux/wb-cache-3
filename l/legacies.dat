40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyses {{the area}} of <b>legacy</b> systems and determines the effects that are exhibited in <b>legacy</b> systems, presenting them in a <b>legacy</b> effect determination framework, so that management can ascertain whether the system they have is a <b>legacy</b> system. An analysis of <b>legacy</b> causal criteria is carried out, resulting in a table of <b>legacy</b> causes. A new definition of <b>legacy</b> systems is put forward, by defining <b>legacy</b> status as a status held by a <b>legacy</b> system. “A system exhibits <b>legacy</b> status if it is deficient {{in terms of its}} suitability to the business, its platform suitability or application software quality, with the effect that its asset value diminishes, as does its ease of operation, maintenance, migration or evolution. ” <b>Legacy</b> status is split into three dimensions, that of system suitability, platform suitability and software quality. These dimensions are analysed and practices shown that enable good quality within them. Solution strategies for handling <b>legacy</b> systems are analysed and broken down into components. These components are analysed in regard to their impact on the <b>legacy</b> causes. A mapping takes place between each strategy component and <b>legacy</b> cause. A <b>legacy</b> causal criteria framework enables management to assess their systems for possible <b>legacy</b> status. This framework can be used on current existing systems or on new proposed systems. This <b>legacy</b> causal criteria framework is cross-referenced to the <b>legacy</b> effect determination framework, allowing management to see the real or potential effects that a weakness in one of the <b>legacy</b> causes may have. These frameworks can be applied both to existing systems to evaluate their <b>legacy</b> status or to potential new systems to evaluate how they will behave in the future...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} the governance of Olympic Games <b>legacy.</b> <b>Legacy</b> is broadly described as “all planned and unplanned, positive and negative, intangible and tangible structures created by and for a sport event that remain for a longer time than the event itself” (Preuss, 2007 a, p. 86). The specific objectives of this study were: a) to map the historical evolution of <b>legacy</b> throughout the modern Olympic Movement (OM) (i. e., 1896 -current day) in order to contextualize and conceptualize the major trends (e. g., changes in <b>legacy,</b> network actors/stakeholders, governance structures and processes) over time; b) to understand, explain, and compare/contrast the network governance of Olympic <b>legacy,</b> using Australian and Canadian case settings; and c) to critically analyze the overall structure and process of the governance of <b>legacy</b> within the OM focusing specifically on the aspects of performance, transparency, accountability, and participation to build a framework and provide policy recommendations for the governance of <b>legacy</b> in mega-events. In order to accomplish these objectives, a historical review of <b>legacy</b> within the OM and two descriptive case studies (Sydney 2000 and Vancouver 2010) were built using interviews and archival materials. Findings showed how the growth of the Games has culminated in the increased use and importance of <b>legacy,</b> leading to greater concept complexity. This resulted in the emergence of several trends including: new <b>legacy</b> themes, heightened interconnectedness, and formalization of governance mechanisms. Institutional theory was then applied to further explore the emergence of <b>legacy</b> and its habitualization, objectification, and sedimentation as an accepted norm in the Olympic Field. The examination of the <b>legacy</b> governance networks in the two cases showed four <b>legacy</b> network governance phases: <b>legacy</b> conceptualization, <b>legacy</b> planning and implementation, <b>legacy</b> transfer, and post-Games <b>legacy</b> governance, as well as a number of governance mechanisms (e. g., contracts, policies) that had an impact on the overall governance of the event’s <b>legacy.</b> Finally, a critical analysis of the governance of Olympic Games <b>legacy</b> was completed. The end result of the research project was a theoretical framework detailing the levels and fluidity of <b>legacy</b> governance in the OM...|$|R

5|$|George I died on 11/22 June 1727 {{during one}} of his visits to Hanover, and George II succeeded him as king and elector at the age of 43. The new king decided not to travel to Germany for his father's funeral, which far from {{bringing}} criticism led to praise from the English who considered it proof of his fondness for England. He suppressed his father's will because it attempted to split the Hanoverian succession between George II's future grandsons rather than vest all the domains (both in Britain and Hanover) in a single person. Both British and Hanoverian ministers considered the will unlawful, as George I did not have the legal power to determine the succession personally. Critics supposed that George II hid the will to avoid paying out his father's <b>legacies.</b>|$|E
