50|$|The name <b>localhost</b> {{is also a}} {{reserved}} {{top-level domain}} name, set aside to avoid confusion with the definition as a hostname. The IETF standards restrict domain name registrars from assigning the name <b>localhost</b> in registration procedures, such as for second-level domains.|$|E
5000|$|When a name {{resolver}} {{receives an}} address (A or AAAA) query for <b>localhost,</b> it should return the appropriate loopback addresses, and negative responses {{for any other}} requested record types. Queries for <b>localhost</b> should not be sent to caching name servers.|$|E

5000|$|The {{next step}} is to fire up a SSH client such as PuTTY with {{tunneling}} to <b>localhost</b> port 5900 enabled.

50|$|Once XAMPP is installed, it is {{possible}} to treat a <b>localhost</b> like a remote host by connecting using an FTP client. Using a program like FileZilla has many advantages when installing a content management system (CMS) like Joomla or WordPress. It is also possible to connect to <b>localhost</b> via FTP with an HTML editor.|$|E
5000|$|When {{authoritative}} {{name servers}} receive <b>localhost</b> queries, they should appropriately resolve them.|$|E

50|$|The {{releases}} of the MySQL database {{differentiate between the}} use of the hostname <b>localhost</b> {{and the use of the}} addresses 127.0.0.1 and ::1. When using <b>localhost</b> as the destination in a client connector interface of an application, the MySQL application programming interface connects to the database using a Unix domain socket, while a TCP connection via the loopback address requires the direct use of the explicit address.|$|E
50|$|The <b>localhost</b> (loopback) address, 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1, and the IPv6 {{unspecified}} address, 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0, {{are reduced}} to ::1and ::, respectively.|$|E

5000|$|An IPv4 or IPv6 address query for {{the name}} <b>localhost</b> must always resolve to the {{respective}} loopback address, which is specified in a separate standard.|$|E
50|$|Some server {{software}} automatically configures resource {{records for}} specially recognized domains or hostnames, such as <b>localhost,</b> but a customized zone master file may be used.|$|E

50|$|On most {{computer}} systems, <b>localhost</b> resolves to the IP address 127.0.0.1, {{which is}} the most commonly used IPv4 loopback address, and to the IPv6 loopback address ::1.|$|E
5000|$|To avoid burdening the Domain Name System root servers with traffic, caching {{name servers}} should never request name server records for <b>localhost,</b> or forward {{resolution}} to authoritative name servers.|$|E
50|$|Applications {{interact}} with CouchDB via HTTP. The following demonstrates {{a few examples}} using cURL, a command-line utility. These examples assume that CouchDB is running on <b>localhost</b> (127.0.0.1) on port 5984.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{the address}} of the {{loopback}} interface, usually assigned the host name <b>localhost,</b> is 127.0.0.1. It consists of the four octets, written in binary notation: 01111111, 00000000, 00000000, and 00000001.|$|E
5000|$|DNS registrars are precluded from delegating domain {{names that}} include <b>localhost,</b> e.g., localhost.com, {{in order to}} avoid the {{confusion}} that would result if a DNS lookup appended a specified search domain.|$|E
5000|$|I2PTunnel is an {{application}} embedded into I2P that allows arbitrary TCP/IP applications to communicate over I2P {{by setting up}} [...] "tunnels" [...] which can be accessed by connecting to pre-determined ports on <b>localhost.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... ::1/128 â€” The {{loopback}} address is a unicast <b>localhost</b> address. If an application {{in a host}} sends packets to this address, the IPv6 stack will loop these packets back on the same virtual interface (corresponding to 127.0.0.1/8 in IPv4).|$|E
5000|$|The name <b>localhost</b> is {{reserved}} by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in [...] (June 1999) as a domain name label {{that may not}} be installed as a top-level domain in the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet.|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} networking, <b>localhost</b> is a hostname {{that means}} this computer. It {{is used to}} access the network services that are running on the host via its loopback network interface. Using the loopback interface bypasses any local network interface hardware.|$|E
50|$|Before Microsoft Visual Studio 2005, PWS {{was useful}} in {{developing}} web applications on the <b>localhost</b> before deploying to a production web server. The IDE of Visual Studio 2005 (and later versions) now contains a built-in lightweight web server for such development purposes.|$|E
50|$|Various Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) {{standards}} {{reserve the}} IPv4 address block 127.0.0.0/8, in CIDR notation and the IPv6 address ::1 for this purpose. The most common IPv4 address used is 127.0.0.1. Commonly these loopback addresses are mapped to the hostnames, <b>localhost</b> or loopback.|$|E
5000|$|The name <b>localhost</b> is {{reserved}} for loopback purposes by RFC 6761 (Special-Use Domain Names), which achieved the Proposed Standard maturity level in February, 2013. The standard sets forth a number of special considerations governing {{the use of the}} name in the Domain Name System: ...|$|E
50|$|For special purposes, such as network testing, documentation, {{and other}} applications, IANA also {{reserves}} {{a set of}} special-use domain names. This list contains domain names such as example, local, <b>localhost,</b> and test. Other top-level domain names containing trade marks are registered for corporate use. Cases include brands such as BMW, Google, and Canon.|$|E
50|$|Miva Merchant Mia is {{a version}} of the Empresa engine {{designed}} to run on a Windows PC as a <b>localhost</b> server watching a specified port, usually 8000 or 8080. No other server software is needed unless the Post Office Protocol (POP) and SMTP functions are used. This provides a portable, stand-alone development environment.|$|E
50|$|It is {{recommended}} that if Synergy is not being used on a trusted local network, that all communications be tunneled through a secure encrypted connection, such as through SSH, stunnel, or a VPN. In this model, the Synergy server computer needs to be running an SSH server, and the Synergy process should be configured to listen only on <b>localhost.</b>|$|E
50|$|MXlo means DNS {{resource}} {{records of}} the MX type that have a value of <b>localhost.</b> The name comes from combining the MX from Mail eXchange and the lo abbreviation for a loopback networking interface, and is an anti-spam technique that is growing in popularity with network administrators who manage {{a large number of}} unused legacy domain names.|$|E
50|$|MXlo was {{conceived}} by a lone network administrator {{for a large}} engineering corporation. As the company acquired and subsequently retired domain names, the MX records for these domains were pointed to <b>localhost</b> to minimize system load from unwanted traffic. As admins and other technical people described this practice to each other, it picked up the nickname MXlo.|$|E
