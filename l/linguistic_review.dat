40|$|Many works {{deal with}} the study of Greek epigrams. These texts gather {{precious}} historical, religious and epigraphic content whose analysis has been addressed from a literary point of view. The degree of dependence of Hellenistic epigrams of earlier period epigrams are of great interest, as shown by recent and numerous papers on this matter (Harder et al. 1998; 2002; 2006; 2012; Bing and Bruss 2007; Baumbach et al. 2010). Another major line of research {{is focused on the}} origin of epigrams and their relation to elegy (Gentilli 1968; Passa 1998 b) or to hexametric poetry and the oral-formulaic language inherited from Homeric tradition (di Tillio 1969; Moranti 1971, 1972; Gentili and Giannini 1977). Furthermore, other authors, such as Day (2010), have pointed out the significance of the performative and ritual nature of epigrams. Likewise, this field of study has undergone a renewal because of new papyrological findings enriching the existing epigram collection corpora. Compared to all these works, monographs and studies dedicated to the analysis of the language of the verse inscriptions are fewer. Many of them explore the linguistic differences between literary epigrams and those epigrams preserved by epigraphic means, as well as the degree of intervention of later tradition on such texts (Tiberi 1996, del Barrio Vega 2008; Kaczko 2009). The first exclusively <b>linguistic</b> <b>reviews</b> were published {{by the end of the}} 19 th century (Wagner 1883; Fengler 1892), however, they are descriptive analyses lacking from an independent methodology. Kock(1910) was the first researcher who systematized and suggested a linguistic hypothesis and upheld the use of epichoric dialects by poets. His theory was supported by adepts such as Kretschmer (1913; 1915) although some discordant voices appeared soon, such as Buck (1923) who denied the existence of a linguistic standard and endorsed the importance of the Ionic model over the epichoric one. Traditionally, Greek language manuals point out the significance of the Ionic model and accept the adaptation of Homeric language to epichoric dialect. The study of verse inscription language was not systematically resumed until Mickey's publications (1981 a; 1981 b). According to this researcher, epigraphic poetry consists of a tempered version of the epichoric dialect where the dialect-characteristic features are avoided. Following the same line but with some differences, Alonso Déniz and Nieto Izquierdo (2009) conclude that the most distinctive features of Argolic are not avoided, at least at the metrical inscriptions from Argolid [...] ...|$|R

This article <b>reviews</b> <b>linguistic</b> approaches to this topic dating from the mid- 20 th century with a special emphasis on the theory known as Feature Geometry. This theory, in its simplest and most general form, characterizes segment-internal feature structure in terms of a feature tree whose terminal nodes are features, whose intermediate nodes are feature classes, and whose root node groups all features defining the segment. The principle objective of this approach is to provide a formal characterization of the class of possible phonological processes. More recent developments and extensions of this approach are examined, with special emphasis on applications to phonetics, such as Articulatory Phonology...|$|R
