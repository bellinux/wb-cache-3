25|$|The <b>line</b> <b>graph</b> of a {{connected}} graph is connected.

25|$|If a graph G has an Euler cycle, that is, if G is {{connected}} {{and has an}} even number of edges at each vertex, then the <b>line</b> <b>graph</b> of G is Hamiltonian.

25|$|As well as K3 and K1,3, {{there are}} some other {{exceptional}} small graphs with the property that their <b>line</b> <b>graph</b> has a higher degree of symmetry than the graph itself.

In the illustration of the diamond graph shown, rotating the graph by 90 degrees is not a symmetry of the graph, but is a symmetry of its <b>line</b> <b>graph.</b> However, all such exceptional cases have at most four vertices. A strengthened version of the Whitney isomorphism theorem states that, for connected graphs with more than four vertices, there is a one-to-one correspondence between isomorphisms of the graphs and isomorphisms of their line graphs.|$|E

For instance, the green vertex on the right labeled 1,3 corresponds to the edge on the left between the blue vertices 1 and 3. Green vertex 1,3 is adjacent to three other green vertices: 1,4 and 1,2 (corresponding to edges sharing the endpoint 1 in the blue graph) and 4,3 (corresponding to an edge sharing the endpoint 3 in the blue graph).|$|E
25|$|The <b>line</b> <b>graph</b> L(G) of any graph G is claw-free; L(G) has a vertex {{for every}} edge of G, and {{vertices}} are adjacent in L(G) whenever the corresponding edges share an endpoint in G. A <b>line</b> <b>graph</b> L(G) cannot contain a claw, because if three edges e1, e2, and e3 in G all share endpoints with another edge e4 {{then by the}} pigeonhole principle {{at least two of}} e1, e2, and e3 must share one of those endpoints with each other. Line graphs may be characterized in terms of nine forbidden subgraphs; the claw is the simplest of these nine graphs.

40|$|AbstractEach graph is an {{intersection}} graph (intersection multigraph) {{of a family}} of sets. Such a family is called a representation if all sets are different and a pseudorepresentation if some are the same. By intersection number we mean the cardinality of the smallest set on which we can construct a representation. So each graph has four intersection numbers. A graph is uniquely representable if it has only one representation on the minimal set.

We show examples of partial <b>line</b> <b>graphs</b> of square and cubic lattices. The method is useful in providing a guideline for synthesizing materials with flat energy bands, since the tight-binding models on the partial <b>line</b> <b>graphs</b> provide us a large room for modification, maintaining the flat energy dispersions.

25|$|A graph L is the <b>line</b> <b>graph</b> of {{some other}} graph or {{multigraph}} {{if and only if}} it is possible to find a collection of cliques in L (allowing some of the cliques to be single vertices) that partition the edges of L, such that each vertex of L belongs to exactly two of the cliques. It is the <b>line</b> <b>graph</b> of a graph (rather than a multigraph) if this set of cliques satisfies the additional condition that no two vertices of L are both in the same two cliques. Given such a family of cliques, the underlying graph G for which L is the <b>line</b> <b>graph</b> can be recovered by making one vertex in G for each clique, and an edge in G for each vertex in L with its endpoints being the two cliques containing the vertex in L. By the strong version of Whitney's isomorphism theorem, if the underlying graph G has more than four vertices, there can be only one partition of this type.|$|E
25|$|As {{well as its}} {{relations}} to treewidth, pathwidth is also related to clique-width and cutwidth, via line graphs; the <b>line</b> <b>graph</b> L(G) of a graph G has a vertex for each edge of G and two vertices in L(G) are adjacent when the corresponding two edges of G share an endpoint. Any family of graphs has bounded pathwidth {{if and only if}} its line graphs have bounded linear clique-width, where linear clique-width replaces the disjoint union operation from clique-width with the operation of adjoining a single new vertex. If a connected graph with three or more vertices has maximum degree three, then its cutwidth equals the vertex separation number of its <b>line</b> <b>graph.</b>|$|E

25|$|Another {{class of}} related results {{concerns}} perfect graphs: every bipartite graph, the complement of every bipartite graph, the <b>line</b> <b>graph</b> of every bipartite graph, and the complement of the <b>line</b> <b>graph</b> of every bipartite graph, are all perfect. Perfection of bipartite graphs {{is easy to}} see (their chromatic number is two and their maximum clique size is also two) but perfection of the complements of bipartite graphs is less trivial, and is another restatement of König's theorem. This was one of the results that motivated the initial definition of perfect graphs. Perfection of the complements of line graphs of perfect graphs is yet another restatement of König's theorem, and perfection of the line graphs themselves is a restatement of an earlier theorem of König, that every bipartite graph has an edge coloring using a number of colors equal to its maximum degree.|$|E
