5|$|French and Spanish {{language}} teachers {{assisted with}} {{development of the}} gameplay for both games, which concentrates on teaching French or Spanish using lessons and minigames. As the player progresses the lessons, the gameplay uses increasingly complex words and phrases. The games received praise and criticism from various video game publications; they praised the games' effectiveness in teaching the language, but lamented their repetitive nature. The next installments in the series, titled My French Coach Level 2: Intermediate and My Spanish Coach Level 2: Intermediate, also developed and published by Ubisoft, were released in Europe on November 23, 2007 alongside their <b>Level</b> <b>1</b> counterparts.|$|E

5|$|If the player's {{character}} {{falls in}} battle, {{they are forced}} to restart from the beginning, with all their items and experience points gone; to avoid this, the player can store items in warehouses found in towns they travel through. Because of this, the player makes long-term progress by upgrading powerful items at village blacksmiths and storing them in warehouses, while upgrading their character is more of a temporary improvement. In the Nintendo DS version of the game, the player can avoid having to start over by getting rescued by another player: this is done by giving the other player a rescue quest, either through a password or the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. When a player embarks on a rescue mission, they start from <b>level</b> <b>1</b> and have to reach the fallen character without stopping at towns on their way. If they succeed, the rescued player can proceed from where they left off, and keep their items and experience points.|$|E
5|$|New York Governor George Pataki urged {{residents}} to purchase emergency supplies and to fill cars with gasoline. The State Emergency Management Office began {{preparing for the}} hurricane about a week before it moved ashore. The office also issued a <b>Level</b> <b>1</b> emergency activation, with a planning unit readying contingency plans and in coordinating the efforts of other state offices. The state's National Guard began preliminary preparations for possible support efforts by reviewing the list of personnel able to be mobilized {{in the event of}} an emergency. Army and Air National Guard officials identified needed equipment {{in the event of an}} emergency, such as helicopters, generators, high-axle vehicles, and communications equipment. State police officers established contingency plans for personnel and equipment to assist as needed. The State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation ensured needed equipment were operational, and also secured buildings with sandbags to prevent flooding. Seven airlines allowed travelers potentially affected by the hurricane to reschedule their flights to a later date.|$|E

5|$|On October22, the National Hurricane Center {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm warning for the island of Hispaniola and {{a tropical storm}} watch for Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas. The tropical storm watch was quickly upgraded to a tropical storm warning. In the Dominican Republic, authorities ordered the evacuation of at least 30,000people living in areas where flooding was possible. On October22 and 23, the Haitian government ordered <b>level</b> <b>1</b> and then level 2 alerts for the county in anticipation of Tropical Storm Alpha's rainfall. Haiti was already experiencing flooding from Hurricane Wilma's passage between October8 and 19, so the threat of more rainfall was particularly dire. The country's Centre National de Meteorologie issued weather bulletins through existing media distribution channels with clear instructions on how residences should prepare for floods and landslides. The local government of Sud-Est ordered the evacuation of its capital city, Jacmel. The national government mobilized personnel and resources of the Direction of Civil Protection, the Secrétariat Permanent de Gestion des Risques et des Désastres (SPGRD), and the National Police to pre-arranged Emergency Operation Centres.|$|E
5|$|Some {{computer}} forecast models initially {{predicted that}} the storm would move towards South Carolina or Georgia. Before the storm's arrival in South Carolina, researchers at Clemson University used Bonnie to test a new method of estimating the damage a storm is likely to cause. In the state, the South Carolina National Guard put about 1,512 men on active duty, 1,474 being of the Army National Guard. On August 25, the South Carolina Emergency Preparedness Division activated <b>Level</b> <b>1</b> operations, the highest of five levels. That same day, the State Governor declared a State of Emergency, calling for mandatory evacuations of residents east of U.S. Route 17 in Horry and Georgetown counties. Schools were closed throughout the state. Over 200,000 people were evacuated from those counties, of which 120,000 were tourists. About 6,000 sought shelter at schools in Horry County. In a survey, 12% of respondents in the state took traffic as a significant consideration in deciding if they should evacuate. On the Grand Strand, Bonnie was the first storm where buses were provided to help people evacuate.|$|E
5|$|Terminal 1 {{opened on}} March 15, 1963, and was {{expanded}} between 1970 and 1974 {{with the current}} A and B Gates buildings. Currently, Terminal 1 has four concourses, {{each of which is}} connected to a central pre-security area. Ticketing and baggage claim are located on <b>Level</b> <b>1</b> of this area. Level 2 houses the three security checkpoints, an esplanade with several retail outlets, and a USO lounge for military service members. West of the pre-security area are the A Gates and the B Gates, two Y-shaped concourses with circular ends. To the south are the C Gates, which can be accessed by the Green Line of the tram system. The satellite D Gates concourse, which opened in 1998, lies to the east and contains three lounges: the Centurion lounge for American Express card holders; the Club at LAS, which is available to all passengers at a fee; and the United Club.

5|$|The Murrah Federal Building {{had been}} {{considered}} so safe that it only employed one security guard. In June 1995, the DOJ issued Vulnerability Assessment of Federal Facilities, also known as The Marshals Report, the findings of {{which resulted in a}} thorough evaluation of security at all federal buildings and a system for classifying risks at over 1,300federal facilities owned or leased by the federal government. Federal sites were divided into five security levels ranging from <b>Level</b> <b>1</b> (minimum security needs) to Level 5 (maximum). The Alfred P. Murrah Building was deemed a Level 4 building. Among the 52security improvements were physical barriers, closed-circuit television monitoring, site planning and access, hardening of building exteriors to increase blast resistance, glazing systems to reduce flying glass shards and fatalities, and structural engineering design to prevent progressive collapse.|$|E
5|$|The game offers three {{different}} skill levels. <b>Level</b> <b>1</b> is the easiest, as {{it uses a}} simplified room layout missing one of the castles {{and one of the}} mazes, and doesn't include the bat and one of the dragons. Level 2 is the full version of the game, with the various objects appearing in set positions {{at the start of the}} game. Level 3 is similar to Level 2, but the location of the objects is randomized to provide a more challenging game. In addition, the player can use the difficulty switches on the Atari 2600 to further control the game's difficulty by affecting the behavior of the dragons: one switch controls the dragons' bite speed, and one causes them to flee when the player is wielding the sword.|$|E
5|$|The {{total cost}} of phase 1 {{of the project was}} £106.2million. The National Lottery Millennium Fund {{provided}} £31.7million, a further £37million came from The National Assembly for Wales and £10.4million was donated by the Arts Council of Wales. In addition a private investor, South African businessman Donald Gordon donated £20million to be shared equally between the Royal Opera House and the Wales Millennium Centre. The Centre also received a £13.5million loan from HSBC. The remaining funds for the project came from a major sponsorship deal with the Principality Building Society. The Weston Studio is named after the Garfield Weston Foundation which funds the Glanfa Stage, and is located on <b>Level</b> <b>1</b> of the Centre.

5|$|Cord and Chi {{infiltrate}} Nagarov's base {{to destroy}} the Super Computer. On {{the roof of a}} large tower, Cord destroys a building with a surface-to-air missile launcher to create a diversion. When he meets with Chi again, she is being threatened by Kostov, who thinks she has betrayed his men. Chi kills Kostov before he can pull the trigger. With Chi's help, Cord uses an elevator to go {{to the top of the}} tower and he activates a cable car leading to an island. Cord explores the docking area, and he finds Alexandria in a cell on the security level. Cord uses the main elevator in the complex to access the other levels. Cord creates a diversion and enters <b>level</b> <b>1,</b> where he inserts the explosive charge into the Super Computer. A cut scene is shown that reveals that Alpha has betrayed him. In a transmission, she tells that premier Nagarov had to be certain that Cord was not acting on her orders when he attacked the refinery. She assured Nagarov that Cord had not entered the facility, but Nagarov had a recording of Cord in the refinery. It resulted in a simple policy shift and the British are now working with the Volgians. As the reactor becomes critical, Nagarov and Lukyan leave the room. Until this moment, the game has taken place in Cord's memory, as he was interrogated by Nagarov after being captured, but from this point on it takes place in real time.|$|E
5|$|When Cord wakes up, {{he finds}} Chi who was {{instructed}} to kill him, but she decides to free him after a conversation. Cord and Chi head for the quayside at <b>level</b> <b>1</b> and manage to lower a bridge leading to a helicopter. After they free Alexandria, they fly away as the base is destroyed. After they spot Nagarov's nuclear submarine, they land on it. Cord and Chi explore the submarine to prevent the missile from being launched. They {{take care of the}} guards, and hear messages about problems with the reactor. After they split up, Lukyan knocks Chi down and takes her to a lower level. Lukyan later ambushes Cord, but he manages to kill him by pushing him into a turbine. In the bridge room, Nagarov enters armed with a gun, and after their conversation, Cord hits Nagarov with a ladder. Cord uses two keys he found to abort the missile launch. After releasing Chi, a message is heard {{that there is only one}} minute left to a critical reactor failure. They return to the deck and are picked up by Alexandria in the helicopter just before the submarine explodes. In the end sequence, Cord phones Alpha and tells her that he has dumped his information about her deal with Nagarov on the Chinese and American intelligence nets. The game ends showing Cord, Chi, and Alexandria approaching a beach where the sun sets.|$|E
