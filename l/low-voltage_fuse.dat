40|$|When fuses are {{subjected}} to current pulses, cyclic stress is induced owing to temperature variations. Damage in the fuse elements is gradually accumulated and results in resistance increase. Consequently, current-time characteristics shift to effect early operation during the normal service period. Under such circumstances, proper protection required for other equipment will not be achieved. Reliability concerns for after sales service arise owing to these facts. The paper presents a method for predicting lifetimes of fuses for cyclic loading. The physical model {{is based on the}} description of elastic, plastic and creep deformation during a series of current pulses. In comparison with existing methods and IEC recommendations, it has the advantage of requiring a very limited number of tests. Results from the physical model can be used to evaluate practical fuse designs and provide advanced information for fuse replacements. The method has been demonstrated for commercial time-lag miniature <b>fuses,</b> <b>low-voltage</b> <b>fuses</b> with M-effect, <b>low-voltage</b> <b>fuses</b> for semiconductor protection, and high-voltage fuses for motor protectio...|$|R
25|$|In the United States and Canada, <b>low-voltage</b> <b>fuses</b> to 1kV AC rating {{are made}} in {{accordance}} with Underwriters Laboratories standard UL 248 or the harmonized Canadian Standards Association standard C22.2 No. 248. This standard applies to fuses rated 1kV or less, AC or DC, and with breaking capacity up to 200kA. These fuses are intended for installations following Canadian Electrical Code, Part I (CEC), or the National Electrical Code, NFPA 70 (NEC).|$|R
50|$|Miniature circuit {{breakers}} and fuses may be rated to interrupt {{as little as}} 85 amperes and are intended for supplementary protection of equipment, not the primary protection of a building wiring system. In North American practice, approved general-purpose <b>low-voltage</b> <b>fuses</b> must interrupt at least 10,000 amperes and certain types useful for large commercial and industrial low-voltage distribution systems are rated to safely interrupt 200,000 amperes. The rating of power {{circuit breakers}} varies according to the application voltage; a circuit breaker that interrupts 50,000 amperes at 208 volts might be rated to interrupt only 10,000 amperes at 600 volts, for example. Direct-current systems such as used with batteries are {{more of a problem}} than alternating current systems, because in the latter current regularly stops.|$|R
25|$|The International Electrotechnical Commission publishes {{standard}} 60269 for <b>low-voltage</b> power <b>fuses.</b> The {{standard is}} in four volumes, which describe general requirements, fuses for industrial and commercial applications, fuses for residential applications, and fuses to protect semiconductor devices. The IEC standard unifies several national standards, thereby improving the interchangeability of fuses in international trade. All fuses of different technologies tested to meet IEC standards will have similar time-current characteristics, which simplifies design and maintenance.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{dealt with}} melting {{characteristics}} of <b>low-voltage</b> miniature cartridge <b>fuse</b> used for 220 V electronic equipment. The experimental sample is <b>low-voltage</b> miniature cartridge <b>fuse</b> with rating of 250 V(3 A) {{and size of}} 5 × 20 mm. In order to evaluate melting and scattering characteristics of the fuse, we applied to 8 / 20 µs surge current, overload current and external thermal stress such as flame of fire. From the experimental results, the fuse element was melted and scattered by applied surge current(above 0. 79 kA) and overload current(above 4. 5 A). It was also attached to the inner surface of the fuse tube. The fuse element was attached as a thin film on inner sur-face of fuse tube when large surge current was applied. It was confirmed, however, the fuse element was not changed by externa...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the mean {{values of the}} resulting magnetic field in the low-frequency range, which were recorded during spring and summer near two-pole-type distribution substations in urban areas. The mitigation of the magnetic field that was achieved after covering the <b>low-voltage</b> (LV) <b>fuse</b> boxes with thin aluminum plates is also presented. The mean attenuation achieved is approximately 23 % during spring and 18 % during the summer at the region of up to 30 cm from the substations and at a height of 1. 0 m from the ground, at the measuring points near the LV fuse boxes. All of the measured magnetic-field values that were observed were lower in comparison with those specified as limits and introduced by ICNIRP. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|<b>Low-voltage</b> (LV) <b>fuse</b> systems, which open {{a circuit}} by cutting the current when it exceeds a given value for an {{adequate}} period, {{are used in}} nonresidential, commercial, and industrial buildings. LV-fuse systems consist of a fuse base, fuse link, and a detachable operating handle. The fuse link is made of a ceramic alloy. In this study, a full-factorial experimental design with two levels was used to solve the fracture problem of fuse links. In this scope, performance criteria (compressive strength), factors affecting the performance criteria (moisture ratio, shaping duration, drying duration, and firing duration) and factor levels were determined in the initial stage. Main effects and interactions among factors were investigated, and factor-level combinations that maximize the compressive strength were determined according to results of analysis. Finally, the relationship between compressive strength and experimental factors was presented {{in the form of}} f = y(x) for prediction purposes...|$|R
