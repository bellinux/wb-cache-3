The celebration derives from Nani's {{background}} in capoeira, which he used to practice as a child. For a while, it was reported that United manager Sir Alex Ferguson had banned Nani's celebration due to fear for his safety. Nani denounced the reports in August 2007, stating it was [...] "not true" [...] and that [...] "Ferguson has never spoken to me about this subject and I am going to continue to celebrate goals in this way.

500|$|New Zealand Herald {{journalist}} Graham Reid similarly deems {{the track}} to be [...] "More interesting than exceptional", as {{an account of}} how Harrison [...] "soaked himself in booze and whatever" [...] {{in reaction to the}} disintegration of his marriage. Among other recent reviews, Scott Elingburg of PopMatters considers Dark Horse to be an album on which [...] "Harrison is playing music <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> nothing to lose and all the world to gain", and he cites [...] "Simply Shady" [...] as one of two tracks that [...] "experiment subtly with tone, mood, and, most surprisingly, darkness". Classic Rock editor Paul Trynka highlights the song among the [...] "beautiful, small-scale moments" [...] that were overlooked {{at the time of the}} album's release, describing it as [...] "a shamefaced confessional on the banality of drunkenness".|$|E
500|$|Reviewing the 2014 Apple Years reissue, for Uncut magazine, Richard Williams dismisses Dark Horse as {{an album}} that [...] "only a devoted Apple Scruff could love", while Joe Marchese of The Second Disc {{describes}} it as [...] "Harrison's earthiest work to date", containing [...] "many stellar moments". Blogcritics' Chaz Lipp comments on the album's [...] "world-weariness" [...] yet similarly finds [...] "a lot of rewarding listening here", with [...] "Bye Bye, Love", [...] "Far East Man", [...] "It Is 'He'" [...] and [...] "Dark Horse" [...] among the highlights. Scott Elingburg of PopMatters opines: [...] "What makes Dark Horse so unique is that, aside from All Things Must Pass, Dark Horse sounds and feels like Harrison is playing music <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> nothing to lose and {{all the world to}} gain." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{adductor}} injury kept Raonic out {{of competition}} for six weeks, {{during which he}} withdrew from the Delray Beach Open and the Mexican Open, and Canada's Davis Cup clash with France. He returned to action at the Indian Wells Masters, reaching the final against world No. 1 Djokovic {{with a string of}} four victories over top20 opponents: Bernard Tomic, Berdych, Monfils, and David Goffin. In the semifinal victory over Goffin, Raonic's average second serve (112mph) was faster than Goffin's average first serve (110mph). Before the final, Djokovic said: [...] "Milos is probably playing the best tennis that he has ever played. His serve was phenomenal before the start of this season, but it seems <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> improved even more, especially the second serve. He's going for it more. He's not giving you the same look." [...] Raonic lost a lopsided straight sets match to Djokovic in the final, his third consecutive loss in an ATP 1000 final.|$|E

Following the surgery, Live Nation announced that the opening concert in Salt Lake City, which {{had been scheduled to}} take place on 3 June 2010, would be postponed to a later date, with other dates also potentially being affected. His doctors, who included noted sports physician Hans-Wilhelm Müller-Wohlfahrt, then said Bono had a good prognosis but would need eight weeks of physical rehabilitation, and McGuinness and Live Nation announced that the entire North American leg was being postponed and would be rescheduled into 2011. McGuinness stated, [...] "Our biggest and I believe best tour has been interrupted and we're all devastated. For a performer who lives to be on stage, this is more than a blow. He [...] feels robbed of the chance to do what he does best and feels <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> badly let down the band and their audience." ...|$|E

500|$|On the character's {{transformation}} Dawson told Digital Spy {{that when}} Darren was younger he was [...] "just a horrible child {{and he had}} nothing nice to say about anyone" [...] before Darren matured and softened. Dawson added that {{it was nice to}} see a different side to the character. Dawson later added that the character's change was good as [...] "everyone goes through changes in their life and Darren just hit that time. It was good timing for him". He also explained that his character becoming a father led him to develop and mature further, stating that Darren accepted his responsibilities as a father and [...] "tries hard to be the father that he wants to be". He felt that Darren enjoyed being a father and that it made him feel [...] "complete and <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> a purpose in life, whereas before he was always chasing his tail". Dawson felt that as time went on, Darren became more helpful, sympathetic and more empathetic towards other characters, especially Jake Dean (Kevin Sacre). Dawson stated, [...] "It's very uncharacteristic but Darren is softening up". Dawson added that Darren's difficult life has led him to mature and act like a [...] "bit of a saint", but that Darren was still greatly misunderstood.|$|E
500|$|... "Homecoming" [...] {{serves as}} a heartfelt tribute to West's {{hometown}} of Chicago, Illinois. Using an extended metaphor that personifies {{the city as a}} childhood sweetheart named 'Windy' (a reference to Chicago's nickname of the 'Windy City'), West rhymes about his love for Chicago and his guilt over leaving [...] "her" [...] to pursue his musical dream. The song's opening lines lyrically paraphrase [...] "I Used to Love H.E.R.", a similarly metaphoric hip-hop song made by West's close friend and labelmate Common, who later appeared in the single's music video. West dedicated [...] "Big Brother" [...] to Jay Z, whom he feels so close to that he sees him as a brother. Within the song, West dually details his love and admiration as well as his envy and antagonism towards Jay Z, metaphorically equating their relationship to that of a sibling rivalry. West also uses the song's chorus as a subsidiary dedication to his mentor No I.D., who first taught him how to produce music. Similar to its musicality, the songwriting characteristics of the album-closing track, [...] "Good Night" [...] alludes to West's next musical progression. The majority of song is composed of repetitive recitations of its choruses and bridges by Mos Def and Al Be Back. West melodically raps only one single verse in which he nostalgically reminisces over taking trips to the museum with his grandparents. As his verse draws to a close, West chastises that a person can't dwell on the past, and charges himself with living his life <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> no tomorrow. In retrospect, with the death of his mother Donda West less than two months after the album was released in addition to the dissolution of his engagement with fiancée Alexis Phifer, the trace amounts of melancholy found scattered throughout Graduation would all but envelop West's next studio album, 808s & Heartbreak.|$|E

2500|$|In 1978, McCotter {{was criticized}} in the Des Moines Sunday Register for a {{statement}} he made during a sermon about child rearing. The sermon {{was based upon}} the Bible verse Proverbs 20:30 ("Blows that wound cleanse away evil; strokes make clean the innermost parts.") In it, McCotter said, [...] "When you discipline, this verse indicates, as others do, {{that you want to}} do it so it wounds. Now, when you say ‘wounds,’ it doesn’t mean that you have a bloody mess on your hands necessarily. It doesn’t mean that you have a child ‘wounding’ <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> a broken leg....

2500|$|In addition, his {{propensity}} for throwing strikes and avoiding walks kept his pitch counts low.

Dodgers general manager Fred Claire admired Maddux's pitching consistency, saying [...] "It's almost like a guy lining up a 60-foot-6-inch putt ... he is just so disciplined, so repetitive in his pitches." [...] Speaking about Maddux's accuracy, Orel Hershiser said, [...] "This guy can throw a ball in a teacup." [...] Baseball Hall of Famer Wade Boggs talked about facing Maddux: [...] "It seems like he's inside your mind with you. When he knows you're not going to swing, he throws a straight one.

It sounds like those off the wall early pop songs like 'Young Parisians' crossed with the 3D filmscapes of the 'Kings of the Wild Frontier' album and sounds like a potential single with its nagging riff in the verses and its great melody. It's great to hear a new song in a near two-hour set of Ant classics and obscurities and is a hint at the healthy future of this remarkable comeback from Adam... People keep talking about the best new band of the year. In a weird way here it is {{right in front of}} you. Decades in and Adam Ant sounds fresher than ever, reinvigorated he sounds <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> just started ...

He contested the early lead before taking a clear {{advantage}} entering the straight and drew away in the closing stages to win by {{seven and a half}} lengths from Top Fortitude. His winning time of 1:20.75 was less than a second off the track record. [...] Stevens returned as his jockey and said, [...] "That was a powerhouse performance.
