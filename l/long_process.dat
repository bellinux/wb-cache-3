5|$|Prior to the 19th century, local {{government}} remained {{largely based on}} the parochial and manorial systems in use since the Middle Ages. In the Potteries towns this led {{to each of the}} townships having varying forms of government. Tunstall was parochially within Wolstanton and manorially part of Tunstall manor; Burslem, although manorially a part of Tunstall manor, parochially was part of Burslem parish. It was through these failing regimes, such as the 1813 lapse of the manorial court of Tunstall, that the <b>long</b> <b>process</b> towards federation began.|$|E
5|$|The signatories of the Act of Independence of Lithuania {{were the}} twenty Lithuanian men {{who signed the}} Act of Independence of Lithuania on February 16, 1918. The signatories were elected to the Council of Lithuania by the Vilnius Conference in September 1917 and {{entrusted}} with the mission of establishing an independent Lithuanian state. The proclaimed independence was established only in late 1918, after Germany lost World War I and its troops retreated from Lithuanian territory. What followed was a <b>long</b> <b>process</b> of building the state, determining its borders, and gaining international diplomatic recognition. The signatories succeeded in their mission and independent Lithuania survived until the Soviet Union occupied the state on June 15, 1940.|$|E
5|$|With {{the failure}} of the Marburg Colloquy and the split of the Confederation, Zwingli set his goal on an {{alliance}} with Philip of Hesse. He kept up a lively correspondence with Philip. Bern refused to participate, but after a <b>long</b> <b>process,</b> Zurich, Basel, and Strasbourg signed a mutual defence treaty with Philip in November 1530. Zwingli also personally negotiated with France's diplomatic representative, but the two sides were too far apart. France wanted to maintain good relations with the Five States.

40|$|The Shortest Job First (SJF) {{algorithm}} {{gives the}} optimal average turnaround {{time for a}} set of processes, but it suffers from starvation for <b>long</b> <b>processes.</b> In this study, the authors developed an algorithm, referred to as Equitable SJF (EQSJF), to reduce the average turnaround time of the <b>long</b> <b>processes</b> without notably affecting the turnaround time of the short processes. Two parameters, the percentage of a process’s burst time to completion and the time spent by a process in the waiting queue, were used to provide the designer with more tradeoff alternatives in keeping the turnaround time of the <b>long</b> <b>processes</b> under control while maintaining the turnaround time of the short processes at low levels, as they are required for soft real-time tasks. Comparisons with previously proposed scheduling algorithms such as the Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN), Railroad Strategy, Enhanced Shortest Job First (ESJF), and Alpha show that the proposed approach always offers better alternatives...|$|R
5|$|During {{the design}} process, {{it was decided}} that the utmost concern was that the ships could be built quickly and placed into service. The ships were to discard the use of {{broadside}} belt armor below the waterline, the attachment of which was an extremely <b>long</b> <b>process.</b> It was believed that the higher speed of the class——would make up for the vulnerability to torpedo attack and make the armor unnecessary.The initial designs called for three main battery turrets, each mounting a pair of new 42cm guns, though this was later increased to four twin turrets. However, the work that would have been necessary to design and test the new turret clashed with U-boat construction, which had become the priority of the Navy. Krupp, the firm that had been awarded the contract to conduct the testing, informed the Reichsmarineamt (RMA—the Imperial Navy Office) that design work on the new turret would have to wait. Capelle accepted the news without much objection. Nevertheless, the ships were never built. The RMA filed a report dated 1 February 1918, which stated that capital ship construction had ground to a halt, primarily due to the shifting priorities to the U-boat war.|$|E
5|$|George III {{reversed}} {{this trend}} {{when he came}} to the throne in 1760. George disliked Hampton Court, and was attracted by the park at Windsor Castle. George wanted to move into the Ranger's House by the castle, but his brother, Henry was already living in it and refused to move out. Instead, George had to move into the Upper Lodge, later called the Queen's Lodge, and started the <b>long</b> <b>process</b> of renovating the castle and the surrounding parks. Initially the atmosphere at the castle remained very informal, with local children playing games inside the Upper and Lower Wards, and the royal family frequently seen as they walked around the grounds. As time went by, however, access for visitors became more limited.|$|E
5|$|In September, the {{ownership}} of Color Air was rearranged. Sunde reallocated his ownership and created Color Group, that would wholly own both Color Line, Scandi Line, Larvik Line and Color Air. Sunde retained a 77% ownership in the corporation through Larvik Scandi Line. The group was subsequently listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. In the general meeting held in December, two of the largest owners of Color Line, Vital Forsikring and the Government Pension Fund of Norway, both were opposed to the merger, as they felt the purchased companies were overvalued. Color Air {{was at the time}} valuated at NOK157 million. After a <b>long</b> <b>process</b> between the miniority shareholders and Color Group, the valuation was adjusted to NOK108 million. In May, Olav Nils Sunde bought the entire Color Group, and delisted it from the stock exchange following the conflict with the other shareholders.|$|E

5|$|In an {{interview}} held in 2013, Galván said that Nuevo Laredo, {{aside from the}} violence generated by organized crime, was plagued with extortions, armed robberies, car hijackings, and regular thefts. He recognized that restoring public safety was possible, but reiterated {{that it was a}} difficult and <b>long</b> <b>process</b> for all branches of the government. Among the solutions he proposed was the reconstruction of Nuevo Laredo's social fiber, since he believed that that would keep the younger generations and those suffering from poverty away from the lure of organized crime. Galván admitted that the Nuevo Laredo police force was composed entirely of members of the Mexican Armed Forces, the Federal Police, and Tamaulipas state law enforcement and not by municipal police officers, who had all been suspended for investigation and training. However, he said that the military had a role to play, but that he wanted to see civilian forces step up to the job in the future.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} have specifically compared baptism with the Isiac initiation described by Apuleius. Before the early fourth century CE, baptism was {{the culmination of}} a <b>long</b> <b>process,</b> in which the convert to Christianity fasted for the forty days of Lent before being immersed at Easter in a cistern or natural body of water. Like the mysteries of Isis, then, early Christian baptism involved a days-long fast and a washing ritual. Both fasting and washing were common types of ritual purification found in the religions of the Mediterranean, and Christian baptism was specifically derived from the baptism of Jesus and Jewish immersion rituals. Therefore, according to Hugh Bowden, these similarities come from the shared religious background of Christianity and the Isis cult, not from the influence of one tradition upon the other.|$|E
5|$|The {{municipality}} {{aims for}} a coherent and holistic {{administration of the}} water cycle to protect against or clean up previous pollution and encourage green growth and self-sufficiency. The main issues are excessive nutrients, adapting to increasing levels of precipitation brought on by climate change, and securing the water supply. These goals have manifested {{in a number of}} large water treatment projects often in collaboration with private partners. In the 2000s, underground rainwater basins were built across the city while the two lakes Årslev Engsø and Egå Engsø were created in 2003 and 2006 respectively. The number of sewage treatment plants is planned to be reduced from 17 to 2 by 2025 as the treatment plants in Marselisborg and Egå are scheduled for expansion to take over all waste water treatment. They have already been refitted for biogas production to become net producers of electricity and heat. To aid the new treatment plants, and avoid floodings, sewage and stormwater throughout the municipality is planned to be separated into two different drainage systems. Construction began in 2017 in several areas, but it is a <b>long</b> <b>process</b> and is scheduled to be finished by 2085.|$|E
