40|$|Furan, a {{possibly}} carcinogenic compound to humans, and furfural, {{a naturally}} occurring aroma compound, {{can be produced}} in heat - processed foods [1, 2]. Therefore, their simultaneous determination is important for food safety and quality purposes. Headspace techniques coupled to gas chromatography - mass spectro metr y (G C - M S) are often used to analyze process - induced compounds. Although headspace <b>trap</b> (H <b>S</b> <b>Trap)</b> extraction has been recently used for furan quantitation in bread crust [3], this technique has not been used for the simultaneous determination of furan and furfural before. This work presents an optimal design of experiments (O - D O E) approach using random blocks for the multicriteria optimization of H <b>S</b> <b>Trap</b> extraction of furan and furfural from sponge cake for their quantification by G C - M S. A bias related to sample preservation was observed during preliminary tests and eliminated in further assays by considering it as a blocking factor. A tailor - made experimental plan including four instrumental factors (i. e. thermostatting temperature and time, dry purge time, pressurization cycles) and two sample preparation variables (i. e. ratio of water and sample weight [dry basis] and total amount [dry basis]), considering the blocking factor was designed. Response surface models (P - value < 0. 0001; R 2 0. 974 for a ll mode ls) resulted in the identification o f most linear and so me quadratic terms and a few second order interactions as influencing the extraction of furan, furfural and their internal standards, d 4 - furan and d 4 - furfura l. Interestingly, one of the samp e preparation variables, namely the ratio of water and samp le weight (dry basis), showed no effect on furfural extraction, while different profiles for furan and d 4 - furan were observed regarding this factor.
