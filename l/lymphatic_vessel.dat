25|$|Lymph {{is formed}} from the fluid that filters {{out of the}} blood {{circulation}} to nourish cells. This fluid returns through venous capillaries to the blood circulation through the force of osmosis in the venous blood; however, {{a portion of the}} fluid that contains proteins, cellular debris, bacteria, etc. must return through the lymphatic collection system to maintain tissue fluid balance. The collection of this prelymph fluid is carried out by the initial lymph collectors that are blind-ended epithelial-lined vessels with fenestrated openings that allow fluids and particles as large as cells to enter. Once inside the lumen of the lymphatic vessels, the fluid is guided along increasingly larger vessels, first with rudimentary valves to prevent backflow, which later develop into complete valves similar to the venous valve. Once the lymph enters the fully valved lymphatic vessels, it is pumped by a rhythmic peristaltic-like action by smooth muscle cells within the <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessel</b> walls. This peristaltic action is the primary driving force, moving lymph within its vessel walls. The regulation of the frequency and power of contraction is regulated by the sympathetic nervous system. Lymph movement can be influenced by the pressure of nearby muscle contraction, arterial pulse pressure and the vacuum created in the chest cavity during respiration, but these passive forces contribute only a minor percentage of lymph transport. The fluids collected are pumped into continually larger vessels and through lymph nodes, which remove debris and police the fluid for dangerous microbes. The lymph ends its journey in the thoracic duct or right lymphatic duct, which drain into the blood circulation.|$|E
2500|$|The blood {{does not}} come into {{direct contact with the}} parenchymal cells and tissues in the body (except in case of an injury causing rupture of one or more blood vessels), but {{constituents}} of the blood first exit the microvascular exchange blood vessels to become interstitial fluid, which comes into contact with the parenchymal cells of the body. Lymph is the fluid that is formed when interstitial fluid enters the initial lymphatic vessels of the lymphatic system. The lymph is then moved along the <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessel</b> network by either intrinsic contractions of the lymphatic passages or by extrinsic compression of the lymphatic vessels via external tissue forces (e.g., the contractions of skeletal muscles), or by lymph hearts in some animals. The organization of lymph nodes and drainage follows the organization of the body into external and internal regions; therefore, the lymphatic drainage of the head, limbs, and body cavity walls follows an external route, and the lymphatic drainage of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvic cavities follows an internal route. [...] Eventually, the lymph vessels empty into the lymphatic ducts, which drain into one of the two subclavian veins, near their junction with the internal jugular veins.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{molecular}} details of <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> (<b>lymphatics)</b> have been rapidly acquired {{due to the}} identification of lymphatic endothelial-specific markers.

50|$|Importantly, the meningeal lymphatics present several unique {{attributes}} that differentiate them from <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> in peripheral organs. Compared to peripheral <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels,</b> the meningeal <b>lymphatic</b> network is markedly less complex (with far less tissue coverage and lymphatic branching). Furthermore, meningeal <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> are generally smaller {{than those in}} the periphery and display an interesting structural homogeneity along the dural sinuses, remaining thinner and mostly unbranched along the superior sagittal sinus while growing larger and more branched along the transverse sinuses. The meningeal <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> are also unique for their scarcity of valves, which prevent back-flow of lymph. While the vessels in the superior parts of the skull were mostly devoid of valves, the larger <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> of the basal parts only contain scattered valves.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the presence and}} regulation of <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> in inflamed joints of mice with experimental arthritis as well as patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritis (SpA). METHODS: <b>Lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> and blood vessels were assessed in synovial tissue of human tumour necrosis factor transgenic (TNFtg) mice and synovial biopsies from patients with RA and SpA by immunohistochemistry for podoplanin and CD 31, respectively. Assessments were performed before and after TNF blockade in all biopsies. RESULTS: <b>Lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> were abundantly present in the synovial tissue of hTNFtg mice as well as patients with RA and SpA. The number of <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> {{was positively related to}} the severity of synovial inflammation.

40|$|Studies on <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> {{in various}} organs {{have been carried}} out both from a {{structural}} than a functional point of view. Data, although scarce, could be found in past works concerning neurotransmission in <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels.</b> Knowledge of the physiologic and/or pathological mechanisms which regulate the functions within the lymphatic system is still scarce and consequently certain pathological alterations, with a probable morphological base, may be clinically misinterpreted as functional disorders. However, in recent years, there is a growing interest about morphological and functional relations between nerve fibers, <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> and lymphoid organs. Actually, increasing evidences have been published regarding this topic. In fact, many papers include descriptions, in some case, of morphological and/or functional interrelations between nerve fibers and structures of the lymphatic system in various organs such as monkey bladder, human lymph nodes, dog thoracic duct, rat skin, Peyer’s plaques from cat ileum, guinea pig intestine, sheep mesenteric <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels,</b> rat femoral <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> etc. Extension of documentation on morphological functions relative to the mechanisms of nerve control in the lymphatic system seems increasingly auspicious to clarify the structural aspects that are {{at the base of the}} physiology and/or pathology of the lymphatic circulation. The aim of this study is to identify the location and the nature of nerve fibres and nervous receptors of the human <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> and to analyse the characteristics of these nerve fibres, using traditional histo-chemical techniques, fluorescent microscopy and immune-bound investigating techniques. <b>Lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> were isolated from human healthy tissues next to traumatic or pathologic lesions during general surgery, after obtained patients informed consensus.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the distribution of}} <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> in normal, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) synovium. METHODS: Synovial tissues from 5 normal controls, 14 patients with RA, and 16 patients with OA were studied. <b>Lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> were identified by immunohistochemistry using antibodies directed against the lymphatic endothelial hyaluronan receptor (LYVE- 1) and recognised blood vessel endothelial markers (factor VIII, CD 34, CD 31). RESULTS: <b>Lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> were found in all zones of the normal, OA, and RA synovial membrane. Few <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> were seen in the sublining zone in normal and OA synovium which did not show villous hypertrophy. However, in both RA synovium and OA synovium showing villous hypertrophy and a chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate, numerous <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> were seen in all zones of the synovial membrane, including the sublining zone of the superficial subintima. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> are present in normal and arthritic synovial tissues and are more numerous and prominent where there is oedema {{and an increase in}} inflammatory cells in the subintima, particularly in RA.

40|$|The {{clinical}} study for lingual disease requires the detailed {{investigation of the}} lingual lymphatic network and lymphatic marker-positive cells. Recently, {{it has been reported}} that several tissue cells and leukocytes express lymphatic markers, LYVE- 1 and podoplanin. This study was aimed to clarify the lingual distribution of cells expressing LYVE- 1 and podoplanin. In the mouse tongue, podoplanin is expressed in nerve sheaths, lingual gland myoepithelial cells, and <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels.</b> LYVE- 1 is expressed in the macrophage marker Mac- 1 -positive cells as well as <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels,</b> while factor-VIII was detected in only blood endothelial cells. α-SMA was detected in vascular smooth muscle and myoepithelial cells. Therefore, identification of <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> in lingual glands, the combination of LYVE- 1 and factor-VIII, or LYVE- 1 and Mac- 1 is useful because myoepithelial cells express podoplanin and α-SMA. The immunostaining of factor-VIII on <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> was masked by the immunostaining to LYVE- 1 or podoplanin because <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> express factor-VIII to a far lesser extent than blood vessels.

In the tunica muscularis of TNF-α-treated tongue, collecting <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> expressed ICAM- 1, but rarely expressed VCAM- 1 whereas blood vessels simultaneously expressed ICAM- 1 and VCAM- 1. The ICAM- 1 -positive rate increased with TNF-α to 75 % from 10 % on initial lymphatics, and to 40 % from 0 % on collecting <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> while it increased to 90 % from 45 % on blood vessels.
