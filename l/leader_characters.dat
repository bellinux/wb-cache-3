40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of administrative leadership in high performance sport, minimal {{attention has been given}} to the area of <b>leader</b> <b>character</b> by sport management researchers. The current study examined the prevalence, perceived importance, and value of <b>leader</b> <b>character</b> within Canadian interuniversity athletics programs. <b>Leader</b> <b>character</b> was quantitatively measured using the <b>Leader</b> <b>Character</b> Insight Assessment (LCIA) instrument (Crossan et al., 2013 a). Differences between sex, position, and experience were also examined. Overall, Accountability and Integrity were the most prevalent <b>leader</b> <b>character</b> dimensions. Sex of administrators did not yield any significant differences between dimensions. Athletic Directors perceived Transcendence to be more important to program effectiveness than Associate Athletic Directors. More experienced administrators placed a higher premium on Integrity than less experienced ones. Administrators and their perceptions of Universities valued <b>leader</b> <b>character</b> similarly. The current study addresses a void present within sport management/leadership literature, and advances the understanding of <b>leader</b> <b>character</b> within Canadian athletics administration...|$|R

40|$|Comparing {{leaders to}} actors {{has a long}} tradition, and {{researchers}} and practitioners in the organizational field have tried to learn lessons from theatre. For developing this approach, this article takes an interdisciplinary theatre studies perspective and discusses how leaders in organizations compare to actors in the theatre. It makes the assertion that the actor’s role in (dramatic, epic and postdramatic) theatre over several historic epochs {{can be seen as}} a complementary, opposed practice that confronts and challenges audiences rather than ‘playing to them’. Theatre does not provide us with ideal or charismatic <b>leader</b> <b>characters</b> but, quite the opposite, teaches us about contentious and problematic heroes. Theatre presents a fundamental disrespect for tenability and positive affirmation and may offer more critical ideas about aesthetic interaction, leadership performance and leader-follower interaction. This illustrates that aesthetic features do not alone turn leadership into an art. ‘Leadership as an art ’ through this lens includes critical interaction through increased aesthetic awareness from the viewpoint of followers...|$|E

40|$|Character is an {{indispensable}} component {{of leadership and}} its development, and thus warrants future research focus. Before a purposeful research stream on character can proceed, however, {{it is critical that}} we fully define and conceptualize the character construct (the ontological basis) and then consider how we might best measure this construct and test it across a diverse array of contexts (the epistemological basis). We pursue these ends by first unpacking the definition of <b>leader</b> <b>character</b> and then by posing a series of questions. Following our initial thoughts related to the locus of <b>character</b> and how <b>leader</b> <b>character</b> is transmitted to and received by followers, we proceed by discussing how character relates to or serves as an antecedent to exemplary leadership styles, how character is contextualized, and how character is developed...|$|R

In this article, we review which consequential leadership outcomes are predicted by facial appearance. We explain why observers are inclined to make heuristic decisions using facial cues, discuss whether facial appearance carries credible information, and identify the conditions that may attenuate face effects...|$|R

We seek to clarify what underpins forms of character-based leadership and exemplary leader behaviors. We build out our previous discussion (Hannah 2 ̆ 6 Avolio, this issue) that the locus of character is within the leader and {{is an integral part of}} the leader 2 ̆ 7 s self-system. Further, we extend the domain of character research toward its upper bounds and introduce the notion of ethos as a distinct class of character and relate ethos to extra-ethical virtuous behaviors. Finally, we place character in relationship to collectives and discuss bidirectional influences operating between <b>leader</b> <b>character</b> and the context...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine whether trust in {{supervisor}} and trust in senior management enhance employees job satisfaction and organizational commitment, and whether trust mediates the relationship between perceived justice and these outcomes. Trust in supervisor was expected to mediate the effects of distributive justice and interactional justice, and trust in senior management was expected to mediate the effects of procedural justice. Theoretical background of the study is based on the framework for trust in leadership developed by Dirks and Ferrin (2002). According to the framework, perceived fairness of leaders actions helps employees to draw inferences about the basis of the relationship and about <b>leaders</b> <b>characters.</b> This allows trust formation. Reciprocation of care and concern in the relationship and confidence in <b>leaders</b> <b>characters</b> are likely to enhance employees job satisfaction and organizational commitment. This study was conducted with cross-sectional data (A/ = 960) of employees from social and health care sector. Hypotheses were studied using correlation analysis and several hierarchical regression analyses. Significances of the mediations were assessed using the Sobel test. Results partially supported the hypotheses. Trust in leadership was positively related to job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Trust in senior management mediated the relationship between procedural justice and the outcomes. Some support was also found for the mediating effect of trust in supervisor in the relationship between distributive justice and organizational commitment. Due to high correlation between trust in supervisor anil interactional justice, it wasn’t possible to study the mediating e fleet of trust in supervisor in the relationship between interactional justice and the outcomes. Against expectations, results indicated that trust in senior management had a mediating effect in the relationship between distributive justice and organizational commitment, and in the relationship between interactional justice and organizational commitment. Results also indicated that trust in supervisor had a mediating effect in the relationship between procedural justice and organizational commitment...|$|R

50|$|In each {{campaign}} {{the player}} {{is involved in}} a linear story with which they interact by performing a series of primary quests and replayable missions. Quests are given to a player by NPCs via text dialog. As quests and missions are completed, new areas, new quests, and new missions are unlocked for the player's character to access. Missions allow the player character to participate in the major events of the storyline, such as significant battles against the main antagonist. Both quests and missions can feature in-game cut scenes which advance the story and provide context to the actions which follow. Cut scenes are in the third-person, often featuring the party <b>leader's</b> <b>character</b> and revealing elements of the game that the character would not normally be aware of, such as the actions of an antagonist. Players are given the option of skipping the cut scenes if all party members agree upon it.|$|R
