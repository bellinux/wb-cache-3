The resulting radiation could then be directed at a material such as paraffin wax; the displaced particles, which were protons, would go into a small ionisation chamber where they could be detected with an oscilloscope.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} of {{the film}} began in New York City on July 2, 2012, and lasted for 23 days.

In order to save money on hiring a full crew and extras, some scenes—including one in Times Square—were shot <b>late</b> <b>at</b> night with a handheld camera. The rooftop location near the Empire State Building is located at 28 W 36th St.|$|E
