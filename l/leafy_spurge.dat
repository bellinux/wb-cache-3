5|$|Exotic species (also {{known as}} {{invasive}} or non-native species) are often unintentionally introduced by people traveling {{from outside the}} forest by sticking to vehicle tires, shoes, or cattle and are usually found near roadways, campgrounds, and other areas used by people. The Forest Service has an invasive species control effort that identifies and attempts to contain the further spread of non-native plants. Invasive plants of particular concern in the forest include spotted knapweed, yellow starthistle, rush skeletonweed, <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge,</b> and cheatgrass.|$|E
5|$|Native {{riparian}} {{plant life}} includes sandbar willows and cottonwoods with Montana's state tree, the ponderosa pine, also being prevalent. Other native plants include wetland {{species such as}} cattails and beaked-sedge as well as shrubs and berry plants like Douglas hawthorn, chokecherry, and western snowberries. To the chagrin of local farmers, Missoula {{is also home to}} several noxious weeds, which multiple programs have set out to eliminate. Notable ones include Dalmatian toadflax, spotted knapweed, <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge,</b> St. John's wort, and sulfur cinquefoil. Controversially, the Norway maples that line many of Missoula's older streets have also been declared an invasive species.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{are largely}} grazing herbivores, unlike {{browsing}} {{animals such as}} goats and deer that prefer taller foliage. With a much narrower face, sheep crop plants {{very close to the}} ground and can overgraze a pasture much faster than cattle. For this reason, many shepherds use managed intensive rotational grazing, where a flock is rotated through multiple pastures, giving plants time to recover. Paradoxically, sheep can both cause and solve the spread of invasive plant species. By disturbing the natural state of pasture, sheep and other livestock can pave the way for invasive plants. However, sheep also prefer to eat invasives such as cheatgrass, <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge,</b> kudzu and spotted knapweed over native species such as sagebrush, making grazing sheep effective for conservation grazing. Research conducted in Imperial County, California compared lamb grazing with herbicides for weed control in seedling alfalfa fields. Three trials demonstrated that grazing lambs were just as effective as herbicides in controlling winter weeds. Entomologists also compared grazing lambs to insecticides for insect control in winter alfalfa. In this trial, lambs provided insect control as effectively as insecticides.|$|E
500|$|Boise National Forest is {{directed}} by the U.S. Forest Service to [...] "control the establishment, spread, or invasion of non-indigenous plant species in otherwise healthy native vegetative ecosystems." [...] The forest's plan addresses the need to control invasive plants, and management efforts include chemical, mechanical, and biological control methods. Invasive plants that are of particular concern in Boise National Forest include spotted knapweed, yellow star-thistle, rush skeletonweed, and <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge,</b> among others.|$|E
500|$|Exotic {{species of}} flora {{that are not}} native to the region include Canada thistle, Musk thistle, Spotted knapweed, <b>Leafy</b> <b>spurge</b> and Yellow toadflax. These {{non-native}} plant species are considered noxious, impacting native plant communities and the species that thrive on them. Native species such as the mountain pine beetle are having an enormous negative impact on some tree species. A survey of the forest performed in 2010 indicated that over [...] of timberland had been impacted by insects such as the mountain pine beetle, spruce bark beetle and Douglas fir beetle, and that the insects had killed between 25 and 100percent of {{the trees in the}} impacted areas. The forest service is addressing the situation by performing controlled burns, selling dead trees as firewood, timber harvesting and spraying the highest value areas.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{farmers are}} {{concerned}} about the disturbance of the land, tiling, soil erosion, and soil quality. Iowa fields contain a lot of drain tiles, which can be damaged. The pipeline company said they would repair any tile damaged during construction and place the pipeline 2 feet (.6 m) below drainage tiles. Some farmers were concerned about soil disturbance, but a Dakota Access spokesman noted that the soil had already been disturbed during the installation of drainage tile in all of the contested farms the pipeline planned to cross. During construction there is also concern for the spread of invasive weeds into the surrounding land. Both states list Russian knapweed (Rhaponticum repens), [...] Canada Thistle (Cirsium arvense), <b>Leafy</b> <b>Spurge</b> (Euphorbia esula), Purple Loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), and Saltceder (Tamarix chinensis) as invasive species of weed. However, under law the management of invasive weeds, once they are on private property, fall under the land owners responsibility. Farmers are also concerned about leaks in the pipeline caused by destabilization in certain areas prone to flooding, which could cause an environmental disaster.|$|E
50|$|<b>Leafy</b> <b>spurge</b> stem boring beetles {{are mainly}} used {{for control of}} the <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge.</b> They are {{combined}} with about 10 other Eurasian insect species, and are used to biologically control <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge</b> stem boring beetle (Oberea erythrocephala), {{also known}} as the {{red-headed}} <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge</b> stem borer is a species of longhorn beetle that is a biological control agent for <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge.</b> It is an effective killer of the pest but only works on certain strains of <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge,</b> namely the subgenus Esula of the genus Euphorbia. Because of this, the beetle is considered as secondary in <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge</b> control to five species of Aphthona flea beetle.|$|E
50|$|The beetles have a {{singular}} diet, only eating certain varieties of <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge.</b> Although being well-established in several states, {{they are not}} usually found in large numbers. The most reliable indicator {{of the presence of}} <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge</b> stem boring beetles is ring-like grooves chewed around <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge</b> stems.|$|E
50|$|Aphthona czwalinae is {{a species}} of leaf beetle known as the black <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge</b> flea beetle. It is used {{as an agent of}} {{biological}} pest control against the noxious weed <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge</b> (Euphorbia esula).|$|E

50|$|Several {{systemic}} herbicides {{have been}} found to be effective if applied in June, when the flowers and seeds are developing, or in early-to-mid-September, when the plants are moving nutrients downward into the roots. Preliminary research suggests that chemical treatment in the fall followed by a spring burn to reduce seed germination may be an effective strategy for reducing <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge</b> infestations. Multiple treatments are necessary every year for several years, making <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge</b> control an extremely expensive undertaking. If left uncontrolled for a single year, <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge</b> can reinfest rapidly. Prescribed burning, in conjunction with herbicides, may also be effective.|$|E
5000|$|Aphthona nigriscutis is a root-feeding {{flea beetle}} {{of the genus}} Aphthona. It is one of 5 Aphthona spp. {{that has been used}} in Alberta, Canada to control <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge,</b> an {{invasive}} plant that reduces pasture quality and degrades natural habitats. It, along with A. lacertosa, is one of only two biocontrol agents thought to be effective against <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge.</b>|$|E
5000|$|This beetle is {{native to}} eastern Europe and central Asia. It was first {{released}} as a biocontrol agent for <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge</b> in the United States in the late 1980s. It {{was thought to be}} a major factor is the success of biocontrol efforts for <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge</b> until it was discovered that most of what was thought to be A. czwalinae was in fact A. lacertosa. With this realization A. czwalinae stopped being an important component in Aphthona <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge</b> control. [...] A. czwalinae had not been verified to persist in North Dakota or Minnesota for several years, until Roehrdanz documented it in Eastern Montana in 2006.|$|E
5000|$|Because of its {{persistent}} {{nature and}} ability to regenerate from small pieces of root, <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge</b> {{is extremely difficult to}} eradicate. Biological control offers a highly promising management tactic for <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge.</b> Goats, apparently able to graze on the plant without ill effect, have been used on rail trails in Idaho to clear <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge</b> from the trail shoulders. [...] Sheep have been used in North Dakota, along with herbicides and flea beetles, to fight it. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has shown success using six European insects that feed on <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge.</b> These include a stem and root-boring beetle (Oberea erythrocephala), five root-mining flea beetles (Aphthona spp.), The Spurge Hawk-moth (Hyles euphorbiae), and a shoot-tip gall midge (Spurgia esulae). Large scale field-rearing and release programs are carried out cooperatively by federal and state officials in many northern states. The results are not as immediate as when herbicides are used but, if pesticide use is kept to a minimum, large numbers of these insects build up within a few years and have shown impressive results.|$|E
50|$|<b>Leafy</b> <b>spurge</b> {{is being}} {{developed}} as a model to answer fundamental questions of weed biology. Over 55,000 ESTs have been sequenced from all plant tissues including tissues from plants that were cold stressed, drought stressed, or attacked by both flea beetles and gall midges. Analysis of the EST sequences indicated that 23,000 unique sequences representing more than 19,000 unigenes were obtained. These sequences are now available on Genbank. The unigenes {{have been used to}} develop cDNA microarrays that also include more than 4,000 additional cDNAs from cassava (another Euphorb related to <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge).</b> These microarrays are being used to identify physiological processes and signals that regulate bud dormancy (one of the main reasons <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge</b> is difficult to control) and invasiveness.|$|E

50|$|<b>Leafy</b> <b>spurge</b> stem boring beetles are solitary. They come {{together}} to mate between late May and June. Females lay their eggs from late June to mid-July.|$|E
50|$|A. nigriscutis {{will feed}} on the native Euphorbia robusta Engelm, though this {{is thought to be}} {{acceptable}} as the weevil significantly reduces <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge</b> populations over time.|$|E

50|$|The adult beetle {{is light}} orange {{with a black}} abdomen and only about 2 {{millimeters}} long. The female lays up to 100 eggs on or near <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge,</b> its host plant. The larva emerges and feeds on {{the roots of the}} plant, while the adult eats the leaves and flowers of the plant. Both larva and adult inflict damage on the plant by feeding. In its native range this beetle feeds on <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge</b> and other closely related plants. It is not known to attack other types of plants.|$|E
50|$|The {{approval}} for {{the introduction of the}} beetle species occurred in 1980. Fifteen years later, the <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge</b> stem boring beetle was widely distributed in at least fifteen US states and several Canadian provinces.|$|E
50|$|Aphthona abdominalis is {{a species}} of leaf beetle known as the minute spurge flea beetle. It {{was used as an}} agent of {{biological}} pest control against the noxious weed <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge</b> (Euphorbia esula), but never established a viable population.|$|E

50|$|<b>Leafy</b> <b>spurge</b> was {{transported to}} the United States {{possibly}} as a seed impurity in the early 19th century. First recorded from Massachusetts in 1827, <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge</b> spread quickly and reached North Dakota within about 80 years. It now occurs {{across much of the}} northern U.S., with the most extensive infestations reported for Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wyoming. It has been identified as a serious weed on a number of national parks and on reserves of The Nature Conservancy in eleven northern states. It is now classified as an invasive species by the United States Department of Agriculture. It was first recorded in Alberta, Canada in 1933 and is also naturalised in parts of South America.|$|E
5000|$|The adult beetle {{is light}} {{golden brown and}} about 3 {{millimeters}} long. The female lays eggs on or near <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge,</b> its host plant, during the summer months. The white larva emerges in about two weeks and feeds on the roots and root hairs. It is active through {{the fall and winter}} until the cold stimulates it to pupate. It burrows into the soil to undergo a three-week pupation. Damage to the plant occurs when the larva eats the roots and the adult feeds on the leaves and flowers. Heavy beetle activity kills the plant. This beetle is a spurge specialist, preferring cypress spurge (Euphorbia cyparissias) in its native range and readily attacking <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge</b> as its first alternate.|$|E
50|$|Euphorbia esula, {{commonly}} known as green spurge or <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge,</b> is a species of spurge native to central and southern Europe (north to England, the Netherlands, and Germany), and eastward through most of Asia north of the Himalaya to Korea and eastern Siberia.|$|E
5000|$|Larvae {{cause the}} most {{damage to the}} plant by feeding on the roots. In one study, beetle success in {{controlling}} <b>leafy</b> <b>spurge</b> {{was related to the}} temperature degree days at the control site, with sites with more temperature degree days having more success.|$|E
50|$|Chamaesphecia crassicornis is a moth of the Sesiidae family.
