40|$|The huge {{market for}} devices {{communicating}} with microwave frequencies in the GHz range creates {{a demand for}} inexpensive, highly efÞcient and miniaturized microwave processors, which can be based on micro-structured spin-waves devices. In addition, computational devices working with spin waves as information carriers [1] can be combined with recently discovered phenomena like the spin Hall effect to form the new class of magnon spintronic devices. To successfully develop this area further, the class of Cobalt-based Heusler materials is of great interest as the small mag-netic Gilbert damping allows for a long spin-wave lifetime and propagation length. But one has to consider that, as this damping extrinsic to the spin-wave system is less pronounced, {{the importance of the}} intrinsic damping (the magnon-magnon redistribution) increases. It has been shown that due to the intrinsic nonlinearity of the <b>Landau-Lifshitz</b> and <b>Gilbert</b> <b>equation,</b> which is governing the spin dynamics in magnetic elements, the nonlinear spin-wave interaction can become the dominant relaxation process also for ferromagnetic metals [2, 3]. Thus, a development of new low Gilbert damping materials calls for a study of the occurring nonlinear spin-wave instabilities as they will be the dominating energy redistribution process.

40|$|The gyromagnetic {{relation}} - i. e. the proportionality {{between the}} angular momentum L⃗ (defined by an inertial tensor) and the magnetization M⃗ - {{is evidence of}} the intimate connections between the magnetic properties and the inertial properties of ferromagnetic bodies. However, inertia is absent from the dynamics of a magnetic dipole (the <b>Landau-Lifshitz</b> <b>equation,</b> the <b>Gilbert</b> <b>equation</b> and the Bloch equation contain only the first derivative of the magnetization with respect to time). In order to investigate this paradoxical situation, the lagrangian approach (proposed originally by T. H. Gilbert) is revisited keeping an arbitrary nonzero inertial tensor. A dynamic equation generalized to the inertial regime is obtained. It is shown how both the usual gyromagnetic relation and the well-known Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation are recovered at the kinetic limit, i. e. for time scales above the relaxation time τ of the angular momentum.

40|$|In {{the last}} years {{nonlinear}} spin dynamics in magnetic microstructures made of metallic ferro-magnetic thin Þlms or layer stacks have gained large interest [15]. The intrinsically nonlinear <b>Landau-Lifshitz</b> and <b>Gilbert</b> <b>equation</b> (LLG), that governs the spin dynamics, {{gives rise to a}} vari-ety of nonlinear effects [6, 7]. Among the metallic ferromagnets, the class of cobalt-based Heusler materials is very promising for perspective magnon spintronic devices and the observation of new phenomena of magnonic transport. The reasons for the interest in these materials are the small magnetic Gilbert damping, the high spin-polarization, and the high Curie temperature [8]. As shown recently, the full Heusler compound Co 2 Mn 0. 6 Fe 0. 4 Si (CMFS) is a very suitable material {{to be used as a}} micro-structured spin-wave waveguide due to the increased decay length which was observed for wave propagation in the linear regime [9]. The reason for this observation is the low Gilbert damping of α = 3 × 10 − 3 of CMFS compared to Ni 81 Fe 19 with α = 8 × 10 − 3, which is the material commonly used in related studies [8]. The decreased magnetic losses not only lead to an increase of the decay length but also to the pronounced occurrence of a number of nonlinear effects, which can qualitatively change the excitation and propagation characteristics o...|$|R
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} easy-plane ferromagnetic substrate, {{interacting with}} a dipolar tip which is magnetised perpendicular {{with respect to}} the easy plane is studied numerically by solving the <b>Landau-Lifshitz</b> <b>Gilbert</b> <b>equation.</b> The dipolar tip stabilises a vortex structure which is dragged through the system and dissipates energy. An analytical expression for the friction force in the v→ 0 -limit based on the Thiele equation is presented. The limitations of this result which predicts a diverging friction force in the thermodynamic limit, are demonstrated by a study of the size dependence of the friction force. While for small system sizes the dissipation depends logarithmically on the system size, it saturates at a specific velocity dependent value. This size can be regarded as an effective vortex size and it is shown how this effective vortex size agrees with the infinite extension of a vortex in the thermodynamic limit. A magnetic friction number is defined which represents a general criterion for the validity of the Thiele equation and quantifies the degree of nonlinearity in the response of a driven spin configuration.

40|$|The <b>Gilbert</b> <b>equation</b> {{summarizes}} {{the standard model}} {{for the evolution of}} the magnetization m in rigid ferromagnetic bodies. Under common constitutive assumptions, it has the form of a parabolic PDE: γ− 1 m˙ + μm×m˙ = m× (αΔm+ β(m· e) e + hs + he). Here m˙ and Δm denote, respectively, the time derivative and the Laplacian of m, and the symbol × denotes the cross product; γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, a negative constant; α, β, μ are positive constants; e is a unimodular vector (the easy axis); he is the external magnetic field and hs is the stray field, the magnetic field generated by the body. 1 In ferromagnetic bodies, it is possible to observe magnetic domains, i. e., regions where the orientation is nearly constant, separated by narrow transitions layers, the domain walls. The application of an external magnetic field induces re-orientation and growth of some domains at the expense of others.

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} a Galerkin {{finite element model}} of magnetisation dynamics in granular thin films. The governing equations of motion are the <b>Gilbert</b> <b>equations</b> with an effective magnetic field taking contributions from exchange interactions, magnetocrystalline anisotropy, applied magnetic field {{as well as the}} magnetostatic field given by Maxwells equations. The magnetostatic field is formulated as a scalar potential described by Poissons equation which is solved using a second order finite element method. The <b>Gilbert</b> <b>equations</b> are discretized in time using an implicit midpoint method which naturally conserves the magnitude of the magnetisation vector. An infinite thin film is approximated using periodic boundary conditions with material microstructure represented using the Voronoi tessellation. The effects of thermal fluctuations are modelled by the stochastic Langevin-Gilbert equations, again solved by a Galerkin finite element method. The implicit midpoint time-stepping scheme ensures that solutions converge in a manner which is consistent with the Stratonovich interpretation of the stochastic integral. The model is then used to investigate the influences of material microstructure on the reversal mechanism of nano-scale cobalt particles, as well as the role of damping in the reversal process and the temperature dependence of hysteresis.

40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of damping and noise due to a sd-interaction in a thin ferromagnetic film sandwiched between two large normal metal layers is carried out. The magnetization is shown to obey in general a non-local equation of motion which differs from the the <b>Gilbert</b> <b>equation</b> and is extended to the non-adiabatic regime. To lowest order in the exchange interaction and in the limit where the <b>Gilbert</b> <b>equation</b> applies, we show that the damping term is enhanced due to interfacial effects but it also shows oscillations {{as a function of}} the film thickness. The noise calculation is however carried out to all orders in the exchange coupling constant. The ellipticity of the precession of the magnetization is taken into account. The damping is shown to have a Gilbert form only in the adiabatic limit while the relaxation time becomes strongly dependent on the geometry of the thin film. It is also shown that the induced noise characteristic of sd-exchange is inherently colored in character and depends on the symmetry of the Hamiltonian of the magnetization in the film. We show that the sd-noise can be represented in terms of an external stochastic field which is white only in the adiabatic regime.
