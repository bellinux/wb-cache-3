5|$|Estrogen {{levels may}} affect thyroid behavior. For example, during the luteal phase (when {{estrogen}} <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> lower), {{the velocity of}} blood flow in the thyroid is lower than during the follicular phase (when estrogen <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> higher).|$|E
5|$|In overt primary {{hypothyroidism}}, TSH <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> {{high and}} T4 and T3 <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> low. Overt hypothyroidism {{may also be}} diagnosed in {{those who have a}} TSH on multiple occasions of greater than 5mIU/L, appropriate symptoms, and only a borderline low T4. It may also be diagnosed in those with a TSH of greater than 10mIU/L.|$|E

50|$|Follicle-stimulating hormone and {{luteinizing hormone}} <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> {{considerably}} elevated (30-33 mIU/mL and 34-37 mIU/mL, respectively) and estradiol and estrone <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> markedly elevated (145 pg/mL and 119-272 pg/mL, respectively), while testosterone <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> normal (445 ng/dL). Sex hormone-binding globulin <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> mildly elevated (6.0-10.0 nmol/L), while thyroxine-binding globulin, corticosteroid-binding globulin, and prolactin <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> all normal. Osteocalcin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> both substantially elevated (18.7-21.6 ng/mL and 33.3-35.9 ng/mL, respectively).|$|R
50|$|One of {{her famous}} aphorisms compares the occidental {{economic}} model to a cake with four levels, with {{glass on the}} top: the first <b>level</b> <b>is</b> nature, the second <b>level</b> <b>is</b> the subsistence economy, the third <b>level</b> <b>is</b> {{the public and private}} economy, and the last <b>level</b> <b>is</b> finance.|$|R
50|$|DDSN uses a {{capability}} {{model that}} consist of four levels. The first <b>level</b> <b>is</b> Reacting, the second <b>level</b> <b>is</b> Anticipating, the third <b>level</b> <b>is</b> Collaborating {{and the last}} <b>level</b> <b>is</b> Orchestrating. The first two levels focus on the internal supply chain while the last two levels concentrate on external relations throughout the Extended Enterprise.|$|R
5|$|Water <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> {{maintained}} {{at a lower}} level during the winter months, when flows are high, and the Drain {{needs to be able}} to cope with higher volumes of rainfall, than during the summer months, when navigable <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> maintained. As on the neighbouring River Witham, the switch between winter and summer levels is normally made at the beginning of April.|$|E
5|$|A {{study in}} {{geometric}} mean urine mercury concentration identified a previously unrecognized source of exposure (skin care products) to inorganic mercury among New York City residents. Population-based biomonitoring {{also showed that}} mercury concentration <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> higher in consumers of seafood and fish meals.|$|E
5|$|Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter is a side-scrolling {{platform}} video game: {{the majority}} of the game features the player-controlled Commander Keen viewed from the side while moving on a two-dimensional plane. The player can move left and right and can jump, and can use a pogo stick to bounce continuously and jump higher than they can normally with the correct timing. The <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> composed of platforms on which Keen can stand, viewed from slightly above. Some platforms allow Keen to jump up through them from below, while others feature fireman's poles that Keen can climb up or down. Keen can also grab onto the edge of platforms and pull himself up. There are giant switches which must be jumped up into or dropped onto to flip which have effects on the gameworld, such as retracting and extending gates or initiate moving platforms. Once entered, the only way to exit a level is to reach the end, though the player can save their game at any point. Between levels, the player travels on a two-dimensional map, viewed from above; from the map the player can enter levels by approaching the entrance or save their progress in the game. Some <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> optional to enter and may be bypassed, while portions of the map are gated off until specific <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> completed.|$|E

30|$|A polygon {{for each}} house was {{produced}} {{based on a}} field experiment, and the damage <b>level</b> information <b>was</b> attached to each polygon. The polygons with same damage <b>level</b> <b>were</b> aggregated and were converted to raster data with 10 -m resolution, which matched the PALSAR- 2 processed data. The raster images for each damage <b>level</b> <b>were</b> aggregated. There were several pixels in which different damage <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> assigned in the same pixel. In that case, the damage <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> averaged. The range, 3.5 ≤damaged level < 4.5 <b>was</b> regarded as <b>level</b> 4; 4.5 ≤damaged <b>level</b> <b>was</b> regarded as <b>level</b> 5.|$|R
50|$|The {{terminal}} has six stories, {{three of}} which are allocated for passenger processing. The third <b>level</b> <b>is</b> for arrivals, the sixth <b>level</b> <b>is</b> for departures, and the fourth <b>level</b> <b>is</b> for boarding. There are two partial levels: the mezzanine service level and the mezzanine <b>level</b> (which <b>is</b> the uppermost <b>level).</b>|$|R
5|$|Growth hormone {{deficiency}} {{is almost}} certain if all other pituitary tests are also abnormal, and {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF-1) <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> decreased. If this is not the case, IGF-1 <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> poorly predictive of the presence of GH deficiency; stimulation testing with the insulin tolerance test is then required. This is performed by administering insulin to lower the blood sugar to a level below 2.2mmol/l. Once this occurs, growth hormone <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> measured. If they are low despite the stimulatory effect of the low blood sugars, growth hormone deficiency is confirmed. The test is not without risks, especially in those prone to seizures or are known to have heart disease, and causes the unpleasant symptoms of hypoglycemia. Alternative tests (such as the growth hormone releasing hormone stimulation test) are less useful, although a stimulation test with arginine may be used for diagnosis, especially in situations where an insulin tolerance test is thought to be too dangerous. If GH deficiency is suspected, and all other pituitary hormones are normal, two different stimulation tests are needed for confirmation.|$|E
5|$|Hypokalemia (low blood {{potassium}} levels) commonly {{occurs during}} attacks; levels below 3.0mmol/l are typically encountered. Magnesium and phosphate <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> often {{found to be}} decreased. Creatine kinase <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> elevated in two thirds of cases, usually due to a degree of muscle injury; severe elevations suggestive of rhabdomyolysis (muscle tissue destruction) are rare. Electrocardiography (ECG/EKG) may show tachycardia (a fast heart rate) due to the thyroid disease, abnormalities due to cardiac arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia), and conduction changes associated with hypokalemia (U waves, QRS widening, QT prolongation, and T wave flattening). Electromyography shows changes similar to those encountered in myopathies (muscle diseases), with a reduced amplitude of the compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs); they resolve when treatment has commenced.|$|E

Around it on various <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> rooms, enclosures and towers accessible through a complex set of stairways that may have once had a defensive purpose. Massive doors with protruding iron spikes protect sections of the fort.|$|E
50|$|Estrogen <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> {{dramatically}} and persistently elevated (estradiol <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> 2340 pg/mL, regarded as being about 10 times the normal level, and ranged from 750-3500 pg/mL), gonadotropin <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> mildly elevated (follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> 6.7-19.1 mIU/mL and 5.8-13.2 mIU/mL, respectively), and testosterone <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> slightly elevated (33-88 ng/dL). Inhibin A <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> also markedly elevated. Sex hormone-binding globulin, corticosteroid-binding globulin, thyroxine-binding globulin, prolactin, and triglycerides, which {{are known to}} be elevated by estrogen, were all within normal ranges in spite of the extremely high levels of estrogen, and inhibin B <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> also normal. Her relatively mildly elevated <b>levels</b> of gonadotropins <b>were</b> attributed to retained negative feedback by progesterone as well as by her elevated levels of testosterone and inhibin A, although it was acknowledged that possible effects of estrogen mediated by other receptors such as ERβ could not be excluded.|$|R

50|$|Zimbabwe's {{public health}} care is {{delivered}} at four <b>levels,</b> which <b>are</b> meant {{to function as a}} referral chain. The first <b>level</b> <b>is</b> the primary <b>level</b> consisting of Rural Health Centres, Rural Hospitals and Urban Clinics (services do not require an attending Physician). The second <b>level</b> <b>is</b> the first referral level consisting of District Hospitals. The third <b>level</b> <b>is</b> the second referral level consisting of Provincial and General Hospitals. The fourth and final <b>level</b> <b>is</b> the third referral level to Central and Special Hospitals.|$|R
5|$|Sonic and Shadow play fast-paced levels, {{emphasizing}} platforming and gameplay. Their homing attack can lock onto robots {{created by}} Eggman and G.U.N., {{and they can}} grind on rails. Tails' and Eggman's <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> slower and oriented towards multi-directional shooting; they are confined to mechs {{in which they can}} jump short heights, hover and shoot enemies. Knuckles' and Rouge's <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> open and feature action-adventure gameplay with treasure hunting; in each level, they must find three shards of the Master Emerald. Their search is guided by radar and puzzle-based clues from harmless robots. Knuckles and Rouge can glide, defeat enemies with punches and kicks and scale walls, digging into them to find power-ups.|$|E
5|$|TSH <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> {{considered}} the most sensitive marker of thyroid dysfunction. They are however not always accurate, particularly if the cause of hypothyroidism {{is thought to be}} related to insufficient TRH secretion, in which case it may be low or falsely normal. In such a case a TRH stimulation test, in which TRH is given and TSH <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> measured at 30 and 60-minutes after, may be conducted.|$|E

5|$|The {{survival}} horror genre is {{also known}} for other non-combat challenges, such as solving puzzles at certain locations in the game world, and collecting and managing an inventory of items. Areas of the game world will be off limits until the player gains certain items. Occasionally, <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> designed with alternative routes. Levels also challenge players with maze-like environments, which test the player's navigational skills. <b>Levels</b> <b>are</b> often designed as dark and claustrophobic (often making use of dim or shadowy light conditions and camera angles and sightlines which restrict visibility) to challenge the player and provide suspense, although games in the genre also make use of enormous spatial environments.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid hormones {{also play}} a role in {{maintaining}} normal sexual function, sleep, and thought patterns. Increased <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> associated with increased speed of thought generation but decreased focus. Sexual function, including libido and the maintenance of a normal menstrual cycle, are influenced by thyroid hormones.|$|E
