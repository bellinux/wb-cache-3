60|$|LINA. [writing] T-a-r-l-e-t-o-n. Er--? [She <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> inquiringly].|$|E
60|$|She <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with a swift bright look; {{next moment}} shakes her head, sighs, {{and looks down}} again.|$|E
60|$|RAINA (placing {{her hands}} on his {{shoulder}} as she <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with admiration and worship). My hero! My king.|$|E
60|$|Gudrun <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> white, childlike, mute with trouble.|$|R
60|$|Her eyebrows were faintly contracted. She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> pathetically.|$|R
60|$|Hesitating, {{she touched}} the towel, then <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> anxiously.|$|R
60|$|Anderson looks compassionately at Mrs. Dudgeon. Then {{he hangs}} his cloak and hat on the rack. Mrs. Dudgeon dries {{her eyes and}} <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
6000|$|TOPPING {{enters with}} a little tray on which is a {{steaming}} jug of [...] fluid, some biscuits and a glass. He comes stealthily up level with [...] the chair. BUILDER stirs and <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|As {{he looks}} down at her, she <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> and whimpers: ‘My lungs is weakly; my lungs is dreffle bad. Poor me, poor me, my cough is {{rattling}} dry!’ and coughs in confirmation horribly.|$|E
60|$|Gudrun <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with a luminous, roguish, unknown face.|$|R
60|$|Wingate laughed softly. She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with {{twinkling}} eyes.|$|R
60|$|He obeyed mutely. She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with bright, unquailing eyes.|$|R
60|$|JOHNNY. Stand still, {{and leave}} it to me. [FAITH <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> hypnotized by his determination] Now, mother, I've come down at your request to discuss this; {{are you ready to}} keep her? Otherwise up we go again.|$|E
6000|$|MISS GALBRAITH: [...] "No, no, thank you, nothing." [...] The Porter hesitates, {{takes off}} his cap, and {{scratches}} {{his head with a}} murmur of embarrassment. Miss Galbraith <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> inquiringly and then suddenly takes out her porte-monnaie, and fees him.|$|E
6000|$|He takes {{back the}} sheet of paper, {{clutches}} his brow, and crosses to [...] the door. As he passes FAITH, she <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with eyes full of [...] expression. JOHNNY catches the look, jibs ever so little, and goes [...] out.|$|E
60|$|And she <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> half smiling, half pouting; {{altogether}} bewitching.|$|R
60|$|She {{closed the}} book and <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with {{twinkling}} eyes.|$|R
60|$|She {{had been}} brooding. She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{suddenly}} in surprise.|$|R
6000|$|MR. RICHARDS, {{coming and}} {{standing}} in front of her, with his hands in his pockets: [...] "Look me in the eye, Lucy!" [...] She drops her veil over her face, and <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> [...] "Did you--did you expect to find ME on this train?" ...|$|E
60|$|He pats {{her on the}} shoulder. She <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with beaming {{eyes and}} he goes out, much moved. Having {{disposed}} of him, she looks at Tanner. His back being turned to her, she gives a moment's attention to her personal appearance, then softly goes to him and speaks almost into his ear.|$|E
6000|$|CARMODY (after {{watching}} the child's preoccupation for a moment, {{in a tone}} of half exasperated amusement). Well, but you're the quiet one, surely! (Mary <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with a shy smile, her eyes still full of dreams.) Glory be to God, I'd not know a soul was alive in the room, barrin' myself. What is it you're at, Mary, that there's not a word out of you? ...|$|E
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{with her}} grey eyes, humiliated and lonely.|$|R
60|$|Meriem <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in surprise. The Hon. Morison grinned sheepishly.|$|R
60|$|Aunt Emma <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> horrified. All her {{firmness}} {{was gone}} now.|$|R
6000|$|TANNER. [remorsefully] Forgive my brutalities, Ann. They are {{levelled}} at this wicked world, not at you. [She <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> {{pleased and}} forgiving. He becomes cautious at once]. All the same, I wish Ramsden would come back. I never feel safe with you: {{there is a}} devilish charm--or no: not a charm, a subtle interest [she laughs]. Just so: you know it; and you triumph in it. Openly and shamelessly triumph in it! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "DEAR SIR CHARLES, After {{my speech}} to-night, embodying my most {{unalterable}} convictions [KATHERINE turns and <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> {{but he is}} staring straight before him, and with a little movement of despair she goes on writing] I have {{no alternative but to}} place the resignation of my Under-Secretaryship in your hands. My view, my faith in this matter may be wrong--but I am surely right to keep the flag of my faith flying. I imagine I need not enlarge on the reasons----" ...|$|E
60|$|PARAMORE (impetuously). You {{must see}} what I mean. Contradict the rumour of your {{attachment}} to Charteris, not by words--it {{has gone too}} far for that--but by becoming my wife. (Earnestly.) Believe me: it is not merely your beauty that attracts me: (Julia, interested, <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> quickly) I know other beautiful women. It is your heart, your sincerity, your sterling reality, (Julia rises and gazes at him, breathless with a new hope) your great gifts of character that are only half developed because you have never been understood by those about you.|$|E
60|$|She ceased bathing his arm, and <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{suddenly}} quite pale.|$|R
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> almost for {{the first}} time since her entrance.|$|R
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> shyly, {{yet with}} unmistakable love transfiguring her countenance.|$|R
6000|$|BURGESS (bent {{on taking}} care of the {{distinguished}} visitor). Well: so this is the way they leave you to yourself, Mr. Morchbanks. I've come to keep you company. (Marchbanks <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in consternation, which is quite lost on him.) James is receivin' a deppitation in the dinin' room; and Candy is hupstairs educatin' of a young stitcher gurl she's hinterusted in. She's settin' there learnin' her to read out of the [...] "'Ev'nly Twins." [...] (Condolingly.) You must find it lonesome here with no one but the typist to talk to. (He pulls round the easy chair above fire, and sits down.) ...|$|E
6000|$|CHRIS--No, {{you stay}} here! [Goes over and pats {{her on the}} shoulder, the tears running down his face.] Ain't your fault, Anna, Ay know dat. [She <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> softened. He bursts into rage.] It's dat ole davil, sea, do this to me! [He shakes his fist at the door.] It's her dirty tricks! It vas all right on barge with yust you and me. Den she bring dat Irish fallar in fog, she make you like him, she make you fight with me all time! If dat Irish fallar don't never come, you don't never tal me dem tangs, Ay don't never know, and every tang's all right. [He shakes his fist again,] Dirty ole davil! ...|$|E
6000|$|But I {{saw more}} to-night. The {{crouching}} man was as visible as the lady whose gown he clutched. He {{is a little}} swarthy fellow, with a black pointed beard. He has a loose gown of damask trimmed with fur. The prevailing tints of his dress are red. What a fright the fellow is in, to be sure! He cowers and shivers and glares back over his shoulder. There is a small knife in his other hand, but he is far too tremulous and cowed to use it. Dimly now I {{begin to see the}} figures in the background. Fierce faces, bearded and dark, shape themselves out of the mist. There is one terrible creature, a skeleton of a man, with hollow cheeks and eyes sunk in his head. He also has a knife in his hand. On the right of the woman stands a tall man, very young, with flaxen hair, his face sullen and dour. The beautiful woman <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in appeal. So does the man on the ground. This youth seems to be the arbiter of their fate. The crouching man draws closer and hides himself in the woman's skirts. The tall youth bends and tries to drag her away from him. So much I saw last night before the mirror cleared. Shall I never know what it leads to and whence it comes? It is not a mere imagination, of that I am very sure. Somewhere, some time, this scene has been acted, and this old mirror has reflected it. But when--where? ...|$|E
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with {{a little}} grimace and patted his hand.|$|R
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with an {{expression}} of pleading in her eyes.|$|R
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> and answered, not him, but her own thoughts.|$|R
