50|$|Initial mission {{profiles}} {{included the}} <b>loft</b> <b>bombing</b> of nuclear weapons. As the training for this imposes repeated high {{stress on the}} aircraft, the airframe lifetime would have been severely limited by metal fatigue, and this maneuver was eliminated.|$|E
50|$|Toss bombing (sometimes {{known as}} <b>loft</b> <b>bombing,</b> {{and by the}} U.S. Air Force as the Low Altitude Bombing System, LABS) is a method of bombing where the attacking {{aircraft}} pulls upward when releasing its bomb load, giving the bomb additional time of flight by starting its ballistic path with an upward vector.|$|E
5000|$|During the Korean War the Squadron {{insignia}} depicted Al Capp's [...] "WolfGirl" [...] {{from the}} comic strip Li'l Abner. The [...] "Wolf Raiders" [...] of VMA-121 remained in South Korea for several years after the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed in 1953. Returning to MCAS El Toro in 1957, the squadron assumed {{its role in the}} Unit Deployment Program with scheduled rotations to Japan and traded in its AD Skyraider aircraft and joined the jet age with the F9F-8B. The Cougar equipped with the LABS system for <b>loft</b> <b>bombing,</b> was the first aircraft flown by the squadron capable of delivering nuclear weapons.|$|E
5000|$|Fugitives: This ending {{requires}} you to follow the full Cal path in chapter 2 but NOT finish Ein's path in chapter 1 or Claudia's path in chapter 2. After the <b>loft</b> is <b>bombed,</b> you must select to [...] "Hide". After this Cal will arrive back from her shopping trip and Reiji vows to escape with her and {{start a new life}} together.|$|R
50|$|Mary of Exeter was {{a carrier}} pigeon who flew many {{military}} missions with the National Pigeon Service during World War II, transporting important messages across the English Channel {{back to her}} loft in Exeter, England. She was awarded the Dickin Medal in November 1945 for showing endurance on war service despite being injured on three occasions and emerging uninjured when her <b>loft</b> was <b>bombed.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Vengeful Spirits: This ending {{requires}} you to follow the full Cal path in Chapter 2. After the <b>loft</b> is <b>bombed,</b> you should select the option to [...] "Kill everyone". Reiji goes berserk and storms Inferno HQ, killing over 20 men and McGuire in the process before dying of multiple wounds, as he believes Inferno has taken Cal away from him. However, Cal {{was not in the}} apartment during the explosion. She waits faithfully for him to return as he promised to, finally accusing him of lying to her after the third morning.|$|R
5000|$|The same {{computational}} solutions {{used in the}} LABS {{system are}} now incorporated into two of the major bombing modes (the computer-controlled CCRP and a dedicated visually oriented [...] "Dive-Toss" [...] mode) of the Fire Control Computer of modern strike fighters such as the F-15E and F-16. As with LABS, the pilot designates their desired impact point, then consents to release while executing a climb, and the computer controls the actual release of the bomb. The integration into the FCC simplifies the pilot's workload by allowing the same bombing mode (CCRP) {{to be used for}} level, dive and <b>loft</b> <b>bombing,</b> providing similar cues in the pilot's displays regardless of the tactics used, since the computer simply sees it as the release point getting closer.|$|E
5000|$|A {{more dynamic}} variant of toss bombing, called over-the-shoulder bombing, or the LABS (Low Altitude Bombing System) {{maneuver}} (known to pilots as the [...] "idiot's loop"), {{is a particular}} kind of <b>loft</b> <b>bombing</b> where the bomb is released past the vertical so it is tossed back toward the target. This tactic was first made public on 7 May 1957 at Eglin AFB, when a B-47 entered its bombing run at low altitude, pulled up sharply (3.5 g) into a half loop, releasing its bomb under automatic control at a predetermined point in its climb, then executed a half roll, completing a maneuver similar to an Immelmann turn or Half Cuban Eight. The bomb continued upward for some time in a high arc before falling on a target which was a considerable distance from its point of release. In the meantime, the maneuver had allowed the bomber to change direction and distance itself from the target.|$|E
5000|$|The {{value of}} toss-bombing was {{increased}} {{with the introduction}} of precision-guided munitions such as the laser-guided bomb. Previous [...] "dumb bombs" [...] required a very high degree of pilot and fire control computer precision to loft the bomb accurately to the target. Unguided <b>loft</b> <b>bombing</b> also generally called for the use of a larger bomb than would be necessary for a direct hit, in order to generate a larger blast that would destroy the target even if the bomb did not hit accurately due to windage or computer/pilot error. Laser-targeting (and other methods like GPS as used in the JDAM system) allows the bomb to correct minor deviations from the intended ballistic path after it has been released, making toss-bombing as accurate as level bombing while still providing most of the advantages of toss-bombing using unguided munitions. However, the targeting pods used to deliver guided munitions generally have a limit to their field of view; most specifically, the pod usually cannot look behind the aircraft at more than a certain angle. Lofting the bomb allows the pilot to keep the target in front of the aircraft and thus within the targeting pod's field of view for as long as possible.|$|E
5000|$|Getting to chapter three may be tricky, {{since it}} {{requires}} {{a specific set of}} circumstances. You must have completed both Ein and Cal's paths, confirmed the sniper's identity, and discovered the identity of the attackers at the harbor. After the <b>loft</b> is <b>bombed,</b> you must [...] "Hide". After this you will meet up with Ein at the warehouse and escape southwards. However, Cal is still alive and thinks that Reiji lied to her. She is then discovered by Scythe, who encourages this belief, and which will form one of the crucial plot points of chapter three.|$|R
5000|$|... "Dive-tossing" [...] is {{generally}} used at moderate altitude (to {{allow for the}} dive) when the target, for whatever reason, cannot be designated precisely by radar. A target for instance may present too small a signature to be visible on radar (such as the entrance to an underground bunker) or may be indistinguishable {{in a group of}} radar returns. The pilot can in this case use a special [...] "boresight" [...] mode that allows the pilot to designate a target by pointing his aircraft directly at it. For a target on the ground, this means entering a dive. Thus designated, the pilot can then begin a climb, <b>lofting</b> the <b>bomb</b> at the target from a distance and regaining lost altitude at the same time.|$|R
