5|$|The Raëlian Embassy for Extraterrestrials is {{the vision}} of the International Raëlian Movement to {{establish}} an embassy, at a base cost of $20 million, with a <b>landing</b> <b>pad</b> that would serve as spaceport for extraterrestrial spaceships. Its location is intended to be in neutral territory, preferably Jerusalem, and would be surrounded by acres of campground capable of supporting about 144,000 people or more than twice the estimated Raëlian membership as of 2005.|$|E
25|$|Leeds General Infirmary is a centre in the UK for neurosurgery, {{and one of}} only 10 centres in the UK for Paediatric cardiology. The {{hospital}} {{features a}} rooftop <b>landing</b> <b>pad</b> for the Yorkshire Air Ambulance Service.|$|E
25|$|Since {{this is a}} {{heliport}} and not an airport, {{there are}} no Instrument Procedures for this facility. The level of boating traffic in the neighboring East River requires that pilots exercise caution in making their approach to the heliport's <b>landing</b> <b>pad.</b>|$|E

25|$|A {{series of}} {{roadside}} attractions {{known as the}} Giants of the Prairies {{can be found in}} Central Alberta. Large mushrooms in Vilna, giant Perogy (Ukrainian dumpling) in Glendon, huge Kubasa (Ukrainian garlic sausage) in Mundare, large Pysanka (Ukrainian easter egg) in Vegreville, a UFO <b>Landing</b> <b>Pad</b> in St. Paul and a giant duck in Andrew.|$|E
25|$|At Seabarn, a 68 metre high hill {{located in}} the mid-Fleet, between Butterstreet Cove and Herbury, is a disused control tower and <b>landing</b> <b>pad</b> for the navy {{helicopter}} firing range in Lyme Bay. The range was closed when the Navy left Portland in 1995. There are also the remains of an anti-aircraft battery from the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|Outside the UK, Husband & Co. had {{an office}} in Colombo and {{undertook}} multiple projects in Sri Lanka. Husband was {{the architect of the}} Ceylon Insurance Building in Colombo, Sri Lanka (later Ceylinco House), a 16-storey building equipped with a helicopter <b>landing</b> <b>pad</b> on its roof. On completion in 1960, it was the tallest structure in Sri Lanka, at nearly 55metres.|$|E

50|$|In July 2016, SpaceX {{applied for}} {{permission}} to build two additional <b>landing</b> <b>pads</b> at <b>Landing</b> Zone 1 for landing the boosters of planned Falcon Heavy flights.|$|R
25|$|To {{forestall}} this, the Royalists counter-attacked the Communist {{positions on}} Skyline Ridge. A pair of Thai battalions attacked its summit in a pincer movement, while a third one {{drove up the}} western slope to capture <b>landing</b> <b>pad</b> Charlie Bravo overlooking the Sam Thong-Long Tieng road. An abortive armored attack on 29 March by Communist T-34s nevertheless succeeded in driving the Thais from Charlie Bravo.|$|E
25|$|There were {{changes made}} to the Andrés Bonifacio class as {{compared}} to their original design during its service with the US Navy, US Coast Guard and the Republic of Vietnam Navy. The ships were passed to the Philippine Navy with fewer weapons on-board and old surface search radars, and these were addressed later on by the Philippine Navy through modernization programs, including {{the addition of a}} helicopter <b>landing</b> <b>pad</b> in 1979.|$|E
25|$|Escobar also owned {{a massive}} Caribbean getaway on Isla Grande, {{the largest of}} the cluster of the 27 coral cluster islands {{comprising}} Islas del Rosario, located approximately 22 miles from Cartagena. The compound, now half-demolished and overtaken by vegetation and wild animals, featured a mansion, apartments, courtyards, a large swimming pool, a helicopter <b>landing</b> <b>pad,</b> reinforced windows, tiled floors, and a large, unfinished building {{to the side of the}} mansion.|$|E
50|$|The 330 by 330 ft hazard field {{included}} five potential <b>landing</b> <b>pads,</b> 311 {{piles of}} rocks and 24 craters that mimic an area on the Moon's south pole.|$|R
5000|$|The {{facilities}} include 2 spa facilities, over 40 meeting rooms, a 1.3 km long beach, a marina, 2 helicopter <b>landing</b> <b>pads,</b> a ballroom that accommodates up to 2500 people, various luxury {{shops and}} international restaurants.|$|R
40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{is presented to}} count bee numbers in images of Langsthroth hive entrances. The algorithm computes approximate bee counts by adjusting {{the brightness of the}} image, cropping a white or green area in the image, removing the background and noise from the cropped area, finding the total number of bee pixels, and dividing that number by the average number of pixels in a single bee. On 1005 images with green <b>landing</b> <b>pads,</b> the algorithm achieved an accuracy of 80 percent when compared to the human bee counting. On 776 images with white <b>landing</b> <b>pads,</b> the algorithm achieved an accuracy of 85 % compared to the human bee counting...|$|R
25|$|On 12 January, GM 30 {{was lifted}} {{back to the}} base of Skyline Ridge and ascended to the Charlie Echo <b>landing</b> <b>pad</b> on its western end. On 14 January, two Thai battalions were brought in to seize both ends of the Ridge. The {{subsequent}} eastward assault along the ridgeline on 17 January by GM 30 was supported by the Thais, artillery fire, and B-52 strikes. By 18 January, the Hmong irregulars had reclaimed all but the eastern end of the ridge at a cost of 35 killed and 69 wounded.|$|E
25|$|Several {{missions}} of Falcon 9 v1.1 {{were followed by}} post-mission test flights calling for the first-stage booster to execute a flip around maneuver, a boostback burn to reduce the rocket's horizontal velocity, a re-entry burn to mitigate atmospheric damage at hypersonic speed, a controlled atmospheric descent with autonomous guidance to the target and finally a landing burn to cut vertical velocity to zero just before reaching the ocean or <b>landing</b> <b>pad.</b> SpaceX announced the test program in March 2013, and their intention to continue to conduct such tests until they can return to the launch site and perform a powered landing.|$|E
25|$|The PAVN {{siege of}} the vital Long Tieng base and its 20 Alternate air strip {{continued}} despite Operation Strength II. On 18 March 1972, the North Vietnamese took the refugee center at Sam Thong, near the guerrilla base. A force from the PAVN 165th Regiment pushed Thai mercenary Bataillon Commando 616 (BC 616) from helicopter <b>landing</b> <b>pad</b> Charlie Charlie on western Skyline Ridge on 19 March. The Vietnamese 335th Independent Regiment held {{the center of}} the ridgeline and its landing pads. Despite the diversionary attacks, of Strength II, with these Vietnamese troops perched overlooking Long Tieng, the 316th Division and 866th Independent Regiment were also poised for an assault to overrun the guerrilla base.|$|E
50|$|The motor yacht Topaz is {{equipped}} with zero-speed stabilizers, jacuzzi (on deck), double helicopter <b>landing</b> <b>pads,</b> swimming pool, tender garage, swimming platform, air conditioning, underwater lights. There's also a fitness hall, cinema and a large conference room.|$|R
50|$|In 1990, the United Arab Emirates receive two complex {{naval vessels}} from the Murray JIB class {{equipped}} with helicopter <b>landing</b> <b>pads</b> {{and with an}} extensive array of weapon systems and sensor technology, not usual for ships of this size.|$|R
50|$|Concrete {{launch and}} <b>landing</b> <b>pads</b> were built. At Kennedy Space Centre a small flame trench for ground {{launches}} was dug near the hazard field (constructed {{to test the}} ALHAT). Cameras and recording equipment were installed. Computers and radio communications equipment used.|$|R
25|$|SpaceX {{announced}} in 2011 {{that they were}} beginning a privately funded reusable launch system technology development program. In December 2015, a first stage was flown back to a <b>landing</b> <b>pad</b> near the launch site, where it successfully accomplished a propulsive vertical landing. This was the first such achievement by a rocket for orbital spaceflight. In April 2016, with the launch of CRS-8, SpaceX successfully vertically landed a first stage on an ocean drone-ship landing platform. In May 2016, in another first, SpaceX again landed a first stage, but during a significantly more energetic geostationary transfer orbit mission. In March 2017, SpaceX became the first to successfully re-launch and land {{the first stage of}} an orbital rocket.|$|E
25|$|Ten {{survivors}} {{were taken}} to the Mary Hitchcock Hospital, at least one in critical condition, and the hospital authorities said that no more injured were expected. The injured were lifted from the crash scene by helicopters and taken to the green {{in the center of the}} Dartmouth College campus, where fire engines and other vehicles lighted the grassy area for an emergency <b>landing</b> <b>pad.</b> The plane carried 39passengers and three crew members, Northeast said. One of the survivors was Frail, 21 years old, of Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, and Winthrop, Massachusetts. The military authorities participating in the rescue operation said that bad weather had complicated matters. It was raining at the crash scene, with snow at higher altitudes, and freezing temperatures were expected.|$|E
25|$|By the mid -1990s, each Sea King {{required}} over 30 man-hours {{of maintenance}} for every flying hour, a figure {{described by the}} Canadian Naval Officers Association as 'grossly disproportionate'. Furthermore, the helicopters are unavailable for operations 40% {{of the time and}} due to the airframes being typically 10–15 years older than other operators' fleets, AIRCOM are often forced to have spare parts custom-made as Sikorsky's supplies are either overly expensive or out of production. Many observers regards AIRCOM's Sea Kings as unreliable, outdated and expensive to maintain. On February 27, 2003, when HMCS Iroquois was deploying to the Arabian Sea, a Sea King crashed shortly after takeoff, and images of the crashed helicopter lying on its side on the destroyer's <b>landing</b> <b>pad</b> were embarrassing. Late that year, the entire fleet was grounded (except for essential operations) for several weeks after two aircraft coincidentally lost power within days of each other.|$|E
50|$|In December 2016 {{the largest}} return {{of land to}} {{civilian}} use since 1972 took place when the U.S. took took possession of the new <b>landing</b> <b>pads</b> and returned 9852 acres of land it had held since the Second World War.|$|R
50|$|The area is not {{served by}} sewer and water systems {{and almost all}} homes are served by on-site well and septic systems. On site ponds, large {{drainage}} swales, numerous canals, and houses on elevated <b>land</b> <b>pads</b> help alleviate flooding in this flat, low lying inland area.|$|R
50|$|The {{airfield}} has {{a single}} 580m grass runway (coded: 24/06), that is serviceable for approximately 10 months of the year. It has a clubhouse and hangarage {{for a number of}} aircraft. It also possesses two <b>landing</b> <b>pads</b> for rotary winged aircraft. The airfield is mainly used by small aircraft, microlights and helicopters.|$|R
500|$|... 14 October 2009 - A British Royal Navy EH101 Merlin landed {{short of}} the {{designated}} <b>landing</b> <b>pad</b> on the Canadian Forces HMCS Montreal. The cause {{was determined to be}} pilot error. [...] Substantial damage to helicopter but no injuries.|$|E
500|$|The International Raëlian Movement envisions {{having an}} {{entrance}} with an aseptic chamber {{leading to a}} conference room for twenty-one {{people as well as}} a dining room of the same capacity. [...] In the plan are seven rooms for the purpose of receiving human guests into the embassy. [...] The embassy building, along with the swimming pool, would be {{in the center of a}} large park and protected from trespassing by a wall—a maximum of two stories—to surround the entire complex's circumference. [...] Trees and bushes are to be planted in the outskirts of the wall's area. [...] The walls are to have a northern and southern entrance. [...] The <b>landing</b> <b>pad</b> for the embassy should be able fit a spaceship of twelve meters of diameter or 39'4" [...] on its terrace. [...] The terrace is to be above the rooms in the torus, which are for extraterrestrials only. [...] The seven rooms directly underneath the <b>landing</b> <b>pad</b> would be protected from occupants of other rooms with a thick metal door. [...] Finally, the International Raëlian Movement wants to avoid military and radar surveillance of the airspace above the embassy. [...] Buildings for administration, food and water provisions, and state-of-the-art sanitation and communication systems are part of this vision. A nearby replica of the Raëlian Embassy for Extraterrestrials open to the public is expected to show visitors what it is like inside the real one.|$|E
2500|$|By May 2014, SpaceX had {{expended}} {{more than}} [...] on {{construction of the}} facility, which includes a <b>landing</b> <b>pad,</b> propellant tanks and a mission control center.|$|E
40|$|This report {{reviews the}} English-language {{technical}} literature on infrasonic and low-frequency noise effects; identifies {{the most salient}} effects of noise produced by a future large civil tiltrotor aircraft on crew, passengers, and communities near landing areas; and recommends research needed to improve understanding {{of the effects of}} such noise on passengers, crew, and residents of areas near <b>landing</b> <b>pads...</b>|$|R
50|$|SpaceX {{signed a}} five-year lease {{for the land}} at the former Launch Complex 13 on 10 February 2015, {{in order to use}} the area to land {{reusable}} launch vehicles. It intends to ultimately convert the old Atlas launch facility into a set of five discrete <b>landing</b> <b>pads,</b> one large primary pad with four smaller alternate pads surrounding it.|$|R
50|$|The 1960s live-action Batman TV series {{featured}} the Batcave extensively, and portrayed it {{as a large}} but well-lit cavern containing an atomic power generator, a chemistry lab, punch-card computers, and other electronic crime-fighting devices, almost always prominently labeled with their function. In this incarnation, it primarily served as a crime lab and garage for the Batmobile. Perhaps the most famous aspect of this Batcave {{is that it is}} accessed from Wayne Manor via two Bat-Poles (one marked BRUCE and the other marked DICK), which are hidden behind a bookcase that can be opened by turning a switch hidden inside a bust of Shakespeare. When Bruce and Dick slide down these Bat-Poles, they are instantly outfitted in their costumes before reaching the <b>landing</b> <b>pads</b> at the bottom. The Bat-Poles {{can also be used to}} lift Bruce and Dick up from the Batcave to Wayne Manor by use of the steamjet-propelled <b>landing</b> <b>pads.</b> The Batcave is also accessible via a service elevator which is used by Alfred.|$|R
