5|$|By early 1862, {{a single}} general, Albert Sidney Johnston, {{commanded}} all the Confederate forces from Arkansas to the Cumberland Gap, but his forces were spread too thinly {{over a wide}} defensive line.

Simon Bolivar Buckner, in Bowling Green, Kentucky, with 4,000 men; the center consisted of two forts, Forts Henry and Donelson, {{under the command of}} Brig. Gen. Lloyd Tilghman, also with 4,000 men. Forts Henry and Donelson were the sole positions defending the important Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers, respectively.
