Co-ownership of assets is widespread in many countries due to inheritance. Central and Eastern Europe offers an interesting natural experiment to assess the effects of such rights imperfections because of the asset restitution process in the 1990 s. Bulgaria is particularly interesting because of the prominence of the co-ownership problem (about half of all land plots are co-owned), because of the strong fragmentation of land, and because of legislation providing an instrument to separate out chosen (endogenous) versus forced (exogenous) firms of co-ownership. We find that <b>land</b> <b>in</b> <b>co-ownership</b> {{is much more likely}} to be used by less efficient firm organizations or to be left abandoned, and that it leads to significant welfare losses...|$|E

The paper hence provides evidence of sub-optimal land allocation following a privatization that established formal but imperfect property rights. Property rights Asset allocation Land markets...|$|E
