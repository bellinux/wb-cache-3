50|$|In adult desmin-null mice, hearts from 10 wk-old animals showed drastic {{alterations}} in muscle architecture, including a misalignment of myofibrils and disorganization and swelling of mitochondria; findings {{that were more}} severe in cardiac relative to skeletal muscle. Cardiac tissue also exhibited progressive necrosis and calcification of the myocardium. A separate study examined this in more detail in cardiac tissue and found that murine hearts lacking desmin developed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and chamber dilation combined with systolic dysfunction. In adult muscle, desmin forms a scaffold around the Z-disk of the sarcomere and connects the Z-disk to the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton. It links the myofibrils laterally by connecting the Z-disks. Through its connection to the sarcomere, desmin connects the contractile apparatus to the cell nucleus, mitochondria, and post-synaptic areas of motor endplates. These connections maintain the structural and mechanical integrity of the cell during contraction while also helping in force transmission and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>load</b> bearing.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{research}} the tank train <b>longitudinal</b> <b>loading</b> during motion by track sections with changes of gradient. The trains of different length that consist of bogie tank wagons should be examined. Influence of cargo type on <b>longitudinal</b> <b>loading</b> of train during motion in concave section of track should be evaluated. Methodology. The {{level of the}} largest longitudinal forces was estimated by mathematical simulation. It was assumed that change of gradient is formed by two grades with baffle platforms, length 50 meters, so that the algebraic difference of limiting grades vary from 10 ‰ to 40 ‰, pitch 10 ‰. The initial speeds were 40, 60, 80, 100, 120 km/h. For evaluation of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>loading</b> the regulating braking and motion "by coasting" was considered. For evaluation of buffing loads the entry to the concave gradient change of expanded train is considered, {{and in order to}} determine the quasi-static forces the compressed train is considered. Findings. As a result of calculations the dependencies of maximal longitudinal forces in the trains on the cargo type, the algebraic difference of the grades, the number of tank wagons, the initial speed, motion modes, and initial gaps condition in the train were obtained. Originality. The <b>longitudinal</b> <b>loading</b> of freight cars of different length formed by the similar bogie tank wagons with one locomotive was obtained. The locomotive is placed in the train head during motion in concave track sections with various algebraic difference of the grades "on coasting" and during the regulating braking mode. The obtained results can be used for parameters standardization of profile elevation of the track. Practical value. The obtained results show that during operation of tank trains on track sections of complex breakage the most dangerous is regulating braking of preliminary compressed trains during entering on concave parts of track. Level of the greatest buffing and quasi-static longitudinal forces is almost independent of cargo and slightly depends on the initial speed...|$|R

Design and methodsthe endovascular prosthesis under investigation was a 24 mm diameter, nitinol, self-expanding aortoaortic device (InterVascular, Clearwater, Florida, U. S. A.). Initially, a motorised digital force gauge developed an incremental load which {{was applied to the}} ends of five stent-grafts, to a maximum of 10 mm (42 %) compression. Secondly, using a simple bench model, each end of four stent-grafts were deployed into 10 cadaveric experimental aneurysm necks and a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>load</b> applied to effect distraction. Resultsincreasing load produced increasing percentage deformation of the stent-grafts. The mean longitudinal distraction load for an aneurysm neck of 20 mm was 409 g (200 – 480 g), for 15 mm was 277 g (130 – 410 g) and for 10 mm was 218 g (130 – 340 g). The aneurysm diameter and aortic calcification hadpvalues of 0. 002 and 0. 047, respectively, while thepvalue for aneurysm neck length was less than 0. 00001.

40|$|We perform {{molecular}} dynamics simulations {{to investigate the}} shock response of idealized hexagonal columnar nanocrystalline Cu, including plasticity, local shear, and spall damage during dynamic compression, release, and tension. Shock loading (one-dimensional strain) is applied along three principal directions of the columnar Cu sample, one longitudinal (along the column axis) and two transverse directions, exhibiting a strong anisotropy in the response to shock loading and release. Grain boundaries (GBs) serve as the nucleation sites for crystal plasticity and voids, due to the GB weakening effect as well as stress and shear concentrations. Stress gradients induce GB sliding which is pronounced for the transverse loading. The flow stress and GB sliding are the lowest but the spall strength is the highest, for <b>longitudinal</b> <b>loading.</b> For the grain size and loading conditions explored, void nucleation occurs at the peak shear deformation sites (GBs, and particularly triple junctions); spall damage is entirely intergranular for the transverse loading, while it may extend into grain interiors for the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>loading.</b> Crystal plasticity assists the void growth at the early stage but the growth is mainly achieved via GB separation at later stages for the transverse loading. Our simulations reveal such deformation mechanisms as GB sliding, stress, and shear concentration, GB-initiated crystal plasticity, and GB separation in nanocrystalline solids under shock wave loading...|$|R

Compression strength characteristics were conducted under quasi-static compressive force at longitudinal and latitudinal (lateral) loading positions and the rupture forces, compressive strength, modulus of deformability, toughness, stiffness and force at bio-yield point determined as the mechanical properties. Results indicated that volume (20. 137 - 21. 856 mm 3), surface area (598. 362 - 720. 208 mm 2), geometric mean diameter (24. 98 - 27. 12 mm), and weight (7. 625 - 9. 203 g) of the velvet bean seed increased linearly with increase in moisture content. Also, the bulk density, specific gravity (0. 378 - 0. 421 g/mm 3), sphericity (0. 882 - 0. 831) and aspect ratio (0. 974 - 0. 726) decreased linearly with increase in moisture content.

On days 1 and 21 of bed rest, postabsorptive venous blood samples and muscle biopsies (vastus lateralis and soleus) were obtained during a 1 -h pulse bolus infusion protocol (0 min, l-[ring- 13 C 6]phenylalanine, 35 μmol/kg; 30 min, l-[ring- 15 N]phenylalanine, 35 μmol/kg). Outcome measures included mixed muscle fractional synthesis (FSR) and breakdown rates (FBR). The Exp group experienced 1 h of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>loading</b> (2. 5 G at the feet) via a short-radius centrifuge during each day of bed rest.
