40|$|The {{driving force}} for the {{semiconductor}} industry growth has been the elegant scaling nature of CMOS technology. In future CMOS technology generations, supply and threshold voltages will have to continually scale to sustain performance increase, <b>limit</b> <b>energy</b> <b>consumption,</b> control power dissipation, and maintain reliability. These continual scaling requirements on supply and threshold voltages pose several technology and circuit design challenges. One such challenge is the expected increase in threshold voltage variation due to worsening short channel effect. This thesis will address three specific circuit design challenges arising from increased threshold voltage variation and present prospective solutions. First, with supply voltage scaling, control of die-to-die threshold voltage variation becomes critical for maintaining high yield. An analytical model will be developed for existing circuit technique that adaptively biases the body terminal of MOSFET devices to control this threshold voltage variation.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{challenge in}} large-scale cloud networks and data centers {{is to achieve}} highly efficient server utilization and <b>limit</b> <b>energy</b> <b>consumption,</b> while providing excellent user-perceived performance {{in the presence of}} uncertain and time-varying demand patterns. Auto-scaling provides a popular paradigm for automatically adjusting service capacity in response to demand while meeting performance targets, and queue-driven auto-scaling techniques have been widely investigated in the literature. In typical data center architectures and cloud environments however, no centralized queue is maintained, and load balancing algorithms immediately distribute incoming tasks among parallel queues. In these distributed settings with vast numbers of servers, centralized queue-driven auto-scaling techniques involve a substantial communication overhead and major implementation burden, or may not even be viable at all. Motivated by the above issues, we propose a joint auto-scaling and load balancing scheme which does not require any global queue length information or explicit knowledge of system parameters, and yet provides provably near-optimal service elasticity. We establish the fluid-level dynamics for the proposed scheme in a regime where the total traffic volume and nominal service capacity grow large in proportion. The fluid-limit results show that the proposed scheme achieves asymptotic optimality in terms of user-perceived delay performance as well as energy consumption. Specifically, we prove that both the waiting time of tasks and the relative energy portion consumed by idle servers vanish in the limit. At the same time, the proposed scheme operates in a distributed fashion and involves only constant communication overhead per task, thus ensuring scalability in massive data center operations.

In this article, we will first review the history of technology scaling that follows Moore’s law from the prespective of microprocessor designs. Challenges to continue the historical scaling trends will be highlighted and design choices to address two specific challenges, process variation and leakage power, will be discussed. In nanoscale CMOS technology generations, supply and threshold voltages will have to continually scale to sustain performance increase, <b>limit</b> <b>energy</b> <b>consumption,</b> control power dissipation, and maintain reliability.

40|$|Today, it is {{possible}} to produce computer generated graphics with amazing realism, even in embedded systems. Embedded systems, such as mobile phones are characterized by limited battery power, and as graphics become more complex, it becomes necessary to find a solution that provides the means to control the energy consumption of graphics at run-time. When energy resources are scarce it would bedesirable to be able to limit how much energy is spent generating graphics so that other, more important, system components may continue to operate for a longer time. This thesis examines how the rendering process can be made power aware and energy efficient. The proposed solution to achieve power awareness without modification to existing hardware and software is a library interposer on top of the OpenGL API. The design and implementation of the interposer library shows that it {{is possible}} to <b>limit</b> <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> with high precision through a relatively simple algorithm. The interposer limits the amount of time the processing units are actively rendering graphics and since CPU and GPU utilization displays a linear correlation with utilization, energy is preserved at the expense of frame rate or image quality. To preserve an acceptable frame rate certain visual effects are turned off to reduce the frame rendering time. Lowering image quality makes it possible to increase frame rate while keeping utilization constant. Measurements show that energy consumption remains stable at lowered image quality and higher frame rate. In the conclusion of this thesis are thoughts on how to incorporate such a system in existing frameworks for power management, and how power management frameworks could be improved to better exploit the possibilities presented by a power aware rendering process. During the research for this master thesis it has become apparent that a scalable rendering process is desirable not only for power management but can be used for other purposes as well...|$|E
