5|$|Though Reagan was a {{controversial}} First Lady, 56% of Americans had a favorable opinion of her {{when her husband}} <b>left</b> <b>office</b> on January 20, 1989, with 18percent having an unfavorable opinion, and the balance not giving an opinion. Compared to fellow First Ladies when their husbands <b>left</b> <b>office,</b> Reagan's approval was {{higher than those of}} Rosalynn Carter and Hillary Clinton. However, she was less popular than Barbara Bush, and her disapproval rating was double that of Carter's.|$|E
5|$|Bush entered {{office with}} the Dow Jones Industrial Average at 10,587, and the average peaked in October 2007 at over 14,000. When Bush <b>left</b> <b>office,</b> the average was at 7,949, {{one of the lowest}} levels of his presidency.|$|E

5|$|Another {{treaty that}} fared badly was the Johnson-Clarendon convention, {{negotiated}} in {{settlement of the}} Alabama Claims, for damages to American shipping from British-built Confederate raiders. Negotiated by the United States Minister to Britain, former Maryland senator Reverdy Johnson, in late 1868, it was ignored by the Senate during {{the remainder of the}} President's term. The treaty was rejected after he <b>left</b> <b>office,</b> and the Grant administration later negotiated considerably better terms from Britain.|$|E
5|$|Assay Commission medals {{were struck}} {{from a variety}} of metals, {{including}} copper, silver, bronze, and pewter. The first Assay Commission medals were struck in 1860 at the direction of Mint Director James Ross Snowden. The initial purpose in having medals struck was not principally to provide keepsakes to the assay commissioners, but to advertise the Mint's medal-striking capabilities. The nascent custom lapsed when Snowden <b>left</b> <b>office</b> in 1861.|$|E
5|$|Bush <b>left</b> <b>office</b> in 2009, {{returning}} to Texas where he purchased {{a home in}} Dallas. In 2010, he published his memoir, Decision Points. His presidential library was opened in 2013. His presidency has been ranked among the worst in historians' polls published in the late 2000s and 2010s.|$|E

5|$|In February 2009, {{the month}} {{after she and}} her husband <b>left</b> <b>office,</b> Laura and George W. Bush moved into a new {{residence}} in Dallas. In November 2009, the former First Lady, accompanied by her husband, made a visit to families of veterans in Fort Hood. The couple expressed their wishes that the trip not be publicized. However, Fox News revealed the trip the following morning.|$|E
5|$|Lane {{resigned}} in February 1920, and <b>left</b> <b>office</b> on March 1. He subsequently accepted employment as Vice President and legal {{advisor to the}} Mexican Petroleum Company, which was run by Edward Doheny (who, after Lane's death, would be implicated in the Teapot Dome scandal), {{as well as a}} directorship of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.|$|E
5|$|One reason {{senators}} {{were reluctant}} to remove the President was that his successor would have been Ohio Senator Wade, the president pro tempore of the Senate. Wade, a lame duck who <b>left</b> <b>office</b> in early 1869, was a Radical who supported such measures as women's suffrage, placing him beyond the pale politically {{in much of the}} nation. Additionally, a President Wade was seen as an obstacle to Grant's ambitions.|$|E
50|$|On March 2006 {{following}} {{the arrest of}} MDC President Morgan Tsvangirai, heavily armed police descended on Harvest House, they ransacked the building, breaking furniture, fixtures, destroying documents, they broke toilet seats and cisterns, they broke doors and several windows <b>left</b> <b>offices</b> of MDC officials strewn with papers, ripped telephone lines and took away computers. According to press reports the debris resembled a scene of bomb attack.|$|R

5|$|Ross {{declined}} {{to become the}} first Texas governor to run for a third term, and <b>left</b> <b>office</b> on January 20, 1891. During his four years in office, he vetoed only ten bills, and pardoned 861 people. Compared to other Texas governors, these are small numbers; Governor Miriam A. Ferguson granted 1161 pardons in just two years.|$|E
5|$|Tyler {{declined}} to seek renomination in late 1820, citing ill health. He privately acknowledged his {{dissatisfaction with the}} position, as his opposing votes were largely symbolic and did little to change the political culture in Washington; he also observed that funding his children's education would be difficult on a congressman's low salary. He <b>left</b> <b>office</b> on March 3, 1821, endorsing his former opponent Stevenson for the seat, and returned to private law practice full-time.|$|E
5|$|While Governor, he {{was named}} Chairman of the Western Governors Association, and joined the Executive Committee of the National Governors Association. Under his leadership, Utah was named the best managed state in America by the Pew Center on the States. He won {{re-election}} in 2008 with nearly 78% of the vote and <b>left</b> <b>office</b> with approval ratings over 80%.|$|E
50|$|Immediately {{after he}} <b>left</b> ministerial <b>office</b> he was created Knight Bachelor in the 1987 Birthday Honours List.|$|R

5|$|After he <b>left</b> <b>office,</b> Harrison {{visited the}} World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in June 1893. After the Expo, Harrison {{returned}} {{to his home in}} Indianapolis. Harrison had been elected a companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States in 1882, and was elected as commander (president) of the Ohio Commandery on May 3, 1893. For a few months in 1894, Harrison lived in San Francisco, California, where he gave law lectures at Stanford University. In 1896, some of Harrison's friends in the Republican party tried to convince him to seek the presidency again, but he declined. He traveled around the nation making appearances and speeches in support of William McKinley's candidacy for president.|$|E
5|$|Although Minton {{was on the}} Supreme Court, he {{remained}} casually involved in Democratic internal politics. He wrote Truman several letters criticizing Justices Robert H. Jackson and Hugo Black, referring to Black as a demagogue. He also offered advice on dealing with Republican opposition in the Senate. In a 1954 letter, after Truman <b>left</b> <b>office,</b> he urged Truman to help focus public attention {{on the economy and}} away from communism, a threat he claimed the Republicans were exaggerating to avoid confronting their own problems.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the old Conservative {{government}} Cave <b>left</b> <b>office</b> on 23 January 1924. He was replaced by Lord Haldane, who was serving for a second time and was sworn in on 25 January. Haldane was in favour of the creation of a Ministry of Justice, and although Schuster was privately against it he suggested that he would have accepted the responsibilities of such a Ministry on the condition that it remained under his control as the Lord Chancellor's Office was. Haldane was ill, however, and the Labour government lasted only ten months thanks to the publishing of the Zinoviev Letter, and no large-scale reforms such as the creation of a Ministry of Justice were ever pushed through.|$|E
25|$|The Buildings {{are divided}} into three sections; the <b>left</b> <b>offices,</b> amphitheatre, and right offices. All are 95metres in length. Each offices block {{contains}} three inner courtyards providing light and air to the offices. Each block has a basement and three floors above ground. The central curved building behind the colonnade houses the committee rooms, a library and conference rooms while the basement contains the kitchen, dining rooms and lounges.|$|R

5|$|As governor, Seward {{incurred}} considerable {{personal debt}} {{not only because}} he had to live beyond his salary to maintain the lifestyle expected of the office, but also because he could not pay down his obligation from the land company purchase. At the time he <b>left</b> <b>office,</b> he owed $200,000. Returning to Auburn, he absorbed himself in a profitable law practice. He did not abandon politics, and received former president Adams at the Seward family home in 1843.|$|E
5|$|As {{impeachment}} proceedings began against President Johnson, Randall {{became one of}} his leading defenders in the House. Once the House determined to impeach Johnson, Randall worked to direct the investigation to the Judiciary Committee, rather than a special committee convened for the purpose, which he believed would be stacked with pro-impeachment members. His efforts were unsuccessful, as were his speeches {{in favor of the}} president: Johnson was impeached by a vote of 128 to 47. Johnson was not convicted after his Senate trial, and Randall remained on good terms with him after the president <b>left</b> <b>office.</b>|$|E
5|$|Baseball {{had been}} {{governed by a}} three-man National Commission, {{consisting}} of American League President Ban Johnson, National League President John Heydler and Cincinnati Reds owner Garry Herrmann. In January 1920, Herrmann <b>left</b> <b>office</b> {{at the request of}} other club owners, leaving the Commission effectively deadlocked between Johnson and Heydler. A number of club owners, disliking one or both league presidents, preferred a single commissioner to rule over the game, but were willing to see the National Commission continue if Herrmann was replaced by someone who would provide strong leadership. Landis's name was mentioned in the press for this role, and the influential baseball newspaper The Sporting News sought his appointment.|$|E
