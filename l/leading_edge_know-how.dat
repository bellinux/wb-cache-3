40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{research}} the effects of <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> shapes {{on the strength of}} centrifugal compressor compeller, the shrouded impellers of a large centrifugal compressor were introduced for finite element analysis. In the present study, the geometric models of 3 shrouded impellers were established in Solidworks 2007, and then numerical simulations were carried out using ANSYS. Through visualization of the computational result of the impellers with a square <b>leading</b> <b>edge,</b> a semi-circular <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> and a elliptical <b>leading</b> <b>edge,</b> it was clarified by comparison that different <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> shapes had significant influences on the compressor strength. According to the charts of the Von Mises stress versus <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> shapes, it was indicated that approximately a 27 % drop and a 32 % drop in maximum Von Mises stress value occurred in the shrouded impellers of a semi-circular <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> and a elliptical <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> compared to a square <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> respectively. That is, the semi-circular <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> or elliptical <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> employed in a centrifugal compressor would dramatically improve structural strength. This paper aims to provide the reference significance the structural optimization and reliability improvement of a large flow centrifugal compressor...|$|R

Three <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> which include a cylindrical <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of radius R = 38. 1 mm, elliptical <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of major radius 1. 5 R & elliptical <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of major radius 2 R have been studied. All three <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> have cylindrical coolant holes at ? 25 ?, ? 0 ? & gill holes at alpha 0 ?, ? 30 ?. There are three rows of film cooling holes with 15 holes each at fixed pitch of 4 D 0 ? & ? 30 ? & two rows of gill holes at ? 60 ? when measured from inside surface.

40|$|Based on {{the premise}} that sharp <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> are {{beneficial}} for launch, ascent and landing phases several concepts for sharp <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> of winged re-entry vehicles have been scrutinized. On the other side blunt <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> mitigate the heat loads during re-entry. Therefore, to comply with material temperature limits either sharp <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> have to be cooled or the curvature shape must be changed between ascent/landing and re-entry flight phases.

Firstly, an equivalent constitutive relationship of laminated glass fiber reinforced epoxy composite plates has been built based on the symmetric laminated plate theory. Then, an optimization objective function of compliant adaptive wing <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> was used to minimize the least square error (LSE) between deformed curve and desired aerodynamics shape. After that, the topology structures of wing <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of different glass fiber ply-orientations were obtained by using the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) model and sensitivity filtering technique. The desired aerodynamics shape of compliant adaptive wing <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> was obtained based on the proposed approach.

This work describes the design and testing of a <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> flap, {{which is used to}} alter the local camber of a propeller blade. The <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> flap is deflected by SMA wires housed in the blade and maintained in a fixed position with a shaft locking and releasing mechanism. A locking and releasing mechanism is utilized so that constant actuation of the SMAs is not required to maintain <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> deflection. The profile at 70 % span of the propeller blade was used to create a two-dimensional blade for <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> flap design implementation and load testing. Deflection of up to five degrees was obtained with the final design of the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> flap and locking and releasing mechanism. The SMA muscles used to deflect the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> were actuated electronically through resistive heating and were controlled by a proportional/integral gain control algorithm with closed-loop feedback from a linear displacement sensor within the blade.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{spanwise}} <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> blowing, {{a means of}} controlling the position and strength of <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> vortices, is analyzed by numerical solutions of the three-dimensional Thin-Layer Navier Stokes equations.

It is found {{that the use of}} spanwise <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> blowing not only magnifies the size and strength of the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> vortices, but also moves the vortex cores outboard and upward. As a result, the increase in lift comes primarily from the greater nonlinear vortex lift.

Existing computer programs used to predict the effect of a <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> vortex do not include a procedure for determining whether or not a vortex actually exists.

In its stowed position, the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> flap forms the lower {{surface of the}} wing <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> up to the horizontal center of the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> radius. For low speed operation, the vortex <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> flap moves forward and rotates down.
