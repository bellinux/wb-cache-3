5|$|Jack is {{contacted}} by Atlas via radio, and is guided to safety from the Splicers and {{the perils of}} the run down city. Atlas requests Jack's help in stopping Ryan, directing him to a docked bathysphere where he claims Ryan has trapped his family. When Jack encounters a wandering <b>Little</b> <b>Sister</b> and its fallen Big Daddy, Atlas urges Jack to kill the <b>Little</b> <b>Sister</b> to harvest her ADAM for himself; Dr. Tenenbaum overhears this and intercepts Jack before he harms the <b>Little</b> <b>Sister,</b> urging him to spare the child and any other Little Sisters he encounters, providing him with a plasmid that would force the sea slug out of her body. Jack eventually works {{his way to the}} bathysphere, but Ryan destroys it before Jack can reach it. Enraged, Atlas directs Jack towards Ryan's mansion through Ryan's army of Splicers and Big Daddies. At times, Jack is forced to travel through areas controlled by Ryan's allies that have now become deranged, such as Sander Cohen, a former musician that now takes enjoyment in watching the death and misery of others.|$|E
50|$|After {{communities}} of <b>Little</b> <b>Sisters</b> {{had begun to}} spread throughout France, the work spread to England in 1851. From 1866-1871 five {{communities of}} <b>Little</b> <b>Sisters</b> were founded across the United States. By 1879, the community Jeanne founded had 2,400 <b>Little</b> <b>Sisters</b> and had spread across Europe and to North America. On 1 March that year, Pope Leo XIII approved the Constitutions for the <b>Little</b> <b>Sisters</b> of the Poor for an initial period of seven years. At {{the time of her}} death on August 29 1879, many of the <b>Little</b> <b>Sisters</b> did not know that she was the one to have founded the congregation. Le Pailleur, however, was investigated and dismissed in 1890, and Jugan came to be acknowledged as their foundress.|$|R

5|$|Caddisflies {{are called}} sedges by anglers. Individual species emerge en masse at {{different}} times, {{and are used}} one after the other, often {{for only a few}} days each year, as models for artificial fishing flies for fly fishing in trout streams. A mass emergence is known as a hatch. Each type has its own angling name, so for example Mystacides is the dancer; Sericostoma the caperer; Leptocerus the silverhorn; Phryganea the murragh or great red sedge; Brachycentrus subnubilis the grannom; Lepidostoma the silver sedge; Oecetis the longhorn sedge; Cheumatopsyche the <b>little</b> <b>sister</b> sedge; Helicopsyche the speckled Peter, an important fishing fly in North America; and Hydropsyche the specked sedge, perhaps the most important caddisfly genus for anglers with over 50 species of net-makers.|$|E
25|$|The game's ending {{depends on}} how the player interacted with the <b>Little</b> <b>Sisters,</b> and the fates of non-player {{characters}} Holloway, Poole and Alexander within the game. Eleanor can save Sofia Lamb or allow her to die, {{depending on whether the}} player spared or executed the non-player characters. If Delta rescued all of the <b>Little</b> <b>Sisters</b> he will breathe his last breath in Eleanor's arms, the weather will be sunny and clean, then she will absorb his personality and memories and leave Rapture with the <b>Little</b> <b>Sisters</b> to change the world for the better, dropping the doll that one of the <b>little</b> <b>sisters</b> give her in the ocean, which slightly resembles Delta, in order to mourn his death, and to make his death count. If Delta harvested all of the <b>Little</b> <b>Sisters</b> then Eleanor will extract Delta's ADAM and become bent on world domination, the weather becoming dark and stormy as the corpses of Rapture's inhabitants float to the surface. A mix between rescuing and harvesting the <b>little</b> <b>sisters</b> gives the player a choice; either Eleanor can absorb his ADAM and become evil, or Delta can stop her and die, in which case Eleanor will mourn his death and make her own way in life.|$|R

Xiāngjiāo fears both the unfamiliarity of future lands and the extreme speed at which it travels. In a December 2015 interview, Malliagh stated the fate of the worm will occur in a full-length album.|$|E
5|$|As the Messi {{family had}} {{relatives}} in Catalonia, {{they sought to}} arrange a trial with Barcelona in September 2000. First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but {{the board of directors}} hesitated; {{at the time it was}} highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin. In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the Infantiles due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. At home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to Rosario with his brothers and <b>little</b> <b>sister,</b> María Sol, while he stayed in Barcelona with his father.|$|E

25|$|As a Big Daddy, {{the player}} can attempt to defeat other Big Daddies who are {{themselves}} escorting Little Sisters. Should the player succeed, {{they can then}} choose to either harvest or adopt the <b>Little</b> <b>Sister.</b> While adopted, the <b>Little</b> <b>Sister</b> can lead the player to corpses from whom she can extract more ADAM. While she does this, the player must defend her from splicer attacks and other foes. Once the <b>Little</b> <b>Sister</b> has collected enough ADAM, the player can then return her to an escape vent, where the player must choose to either rescue or harvest the <b>Little</b> <b>Sister.</b> Rescuing her gives the player a modest amount of ADAM but also the possibility of beneficial gifts later; harvesting her yields a large ADAM boost. ADAM can then be spent at Gatherer's Garden machines throughout Rapture to buy new plasmids, gene tonics, slots, or health/eve upgrades. Once the player has either rescued or harvested each of the Little Sisters on the level, the player will be attacked by a Big Sister. The Big Sister's agility and resourcefulness will task the player with a difficult fight before the player can proceed further in the game.|$|E
