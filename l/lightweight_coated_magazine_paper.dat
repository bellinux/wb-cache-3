50|$|Norske Skog Walsum is a {{pulp mill}} and paper mill {{situated}} in the Duisburg neighborhood of Walsum, the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The mill starts operations in 1962, established by Haindl and owned by Norske Skog from 2001. Since the 1990s the mill had two paper machines producing <b>lightweight</b> <b>coated</b> paper, a type of <b>magazine</b> <b>paper.</b> Both paper machines have a trimmed width of 725 cm. PM4 has an annual production of 225,000 tonnes, PM10 has 215,000 tonnes. The mill used as its source one-third thermomechanical pulp, one-third kraft pulp and one-third coating. The mill is situated on the Rhine. Until production curtailment in 2013, the mill employed 460 people.|$|R
50|$|The mill at Walsum {{opened in}} 1962 under the {{ownership}} of Haindl, initially consisting of one paper machine. PM4 was installed in 1985, followed by PM10 in 1991. Both were manufactured by Voith. Combined they gave an annual capacity of 420,000 tonnes of <b>lightweight</b> <b>coated</b> paper. The owners of the family-owned Haindl consortium decided to sell the company in 2000. It was bought in a joint deal, where UPM took over four and Norske Skog bought two of the mills—Parenco and Walsum. The deal took effect on 30 November 2001, with Norske Skog paying 8.2 billion Norwegian krone for the two mills. Norske Skog was {{in a process of}} specialization, selling all non-core assets while purchasing a dominant position in the world's newsprint and <b>magazine</b> <b>paper</b> market. Walsum allowed Norske Skog to add LWC to its portfolio.|$|R

5000|$|The Px4 is {{available}} in [...]45 ACP designated as the Px4 Storm SD (Special Duty). Notable differences between the standard [...]45 ACP and the Special Duty are the desert tan frame color, PVD <b>coated</b> <b>magazines</b> and internal firing control assembly, double recoil spring, specially roll marked slide and a longer barrel to facilitate {{the use of a}} suppressor. The PVD <b>coated</b> <b>magazines</b> (one 9- and two 10-round magazines come with the package) are not scheduled to be imported and there will only be one production run of the Px4SD. Supplies are limited. Initial photos show the barrel with a silver proprietary coating but the production models have a black finished barrel. Also, pistol tags indicate that superluminova sight paint is standard but Beretta USA discontinued use of the paint in 2009 so the Px4SD will have standard white 3-dot sights. The special Pelican case contains oil, cleaning kit, three magazines, pistol, all three back straps, all three magazine buttons, manual, warranty card and two foam dividers.|$|R

50|$|Typically, Edwardian women {{interested}} or {{involved in}} any mechanical disciplines were perceived to be masculine in outlook, temperament and style, who would also dress in utilitarian male type clothing.

Levitt, however, raced dressed in flattering feminine outfits complete with co-ordinating hat and veil; a loose, <b>lightweight</b> <b>coat,</b> which became popularly known as a dust coat, afforded overall protection to her fashionable clothes.|$|R

50|$|Just {{prior to}} World War II, ponchos were {{significantly}} improved during testing with the U.S. Army Jungle Experimental Platoon {{in the jungles}} of Panama, incorporating new, lighter materials and a drawcord hood that could be closed off to form a rain fly or ground sheet. Ponchos were widely used by United States armed forces during World War II; even lightly equipped foot-mounted forces such as Merrill's Marauders, forced to discard tentage and all other unnecessary equipment, retained their blanket and poncho. During the 1950s, new <b>lightweight</b> <b>coated</b> nylon and other synthetic materials were developed for military ponchos. The poncho has remained in service ever since as a standard piece of U.S. military field equipment. Today, the United States armed forces issue ponchos {{that may be used}} as a field expedient shelter. These garments are also used by hunters, campers, and rescue workers.|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{evidence that}} a thin (1 to 2 µm) membrane might form {{on the surface of}} the paper where most of the water was pressed out, followed by evaporative drying on that side. According to the serial cross sections, this membrane feature, like a plastic shrinkwrap, lays on the surface fibres but also spans across gaps if they aren’t too large. The question must be asked whether this membrane feature is real or, if so, is it crucial to the fluid penetration behavior compared to the z-direction density distribution from pressing as previously thought—they may both work together. This work was performed a particular 50 g/m 2 <b>lightweight</b> <b>coated</b> base sheet so more research is needed to independently confirm the membrane’s existence, determine how widespread the phenomenon, of what material the membrane consists, and whether it is critical to the paper’s fluid penetration behavior and other properties...|$|R

25|$|Parallel these plans, Norske Skog {{considered}} the possibility of building a fourth paper machine at Fiborgtangen. PM4 was planned to produce <b>magazine</b> <b>paper,</b> but was dependent on the thermal power station to receive sufficient power. Between the two investments were stipulated to between NOK7 and 8 billion. The investments were placed on hold of several factors. One was a general decline in the demand for paper, and general increasing costs in Norway, making Noske Skog prefer investments in their foreign mills. Another reason was that Norske Skog spent most of its capital purchasing foreign mills {{in an attempt to}} become a dominant worldwide manufacturer of newsprint and <b>magazine</b> <b>paper.</b>|$|R
