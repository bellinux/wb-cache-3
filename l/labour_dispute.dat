He {{recorded}} 17 points in ten games before the NHL's <b>labour</b> <b>dispute</b> was resolved, bringing him back to Calgary. Late in the season, Fleury recorded two goals and an assist against the Oilers on March 31, 1995, to surpass 500career points.|$|E
5|$|While the 2004–05 NHL {{season was}} {{ultimately}} cancelled by a <b>labour</b> <b>dispute,</b> St. Louis spent it playing in Europe. He {{signed a contract}} with HC Lausanne of Switzerland's National League A. He scored 25 points in 23 games. When the NHL resumed in 2005–06, St. Louis signed a six-year contract extension with the Lightning worth US$31.5 million. He finished with his third 30-goal season, but scored only 61 points on the campaign.|$|E

His total of 109 points, also a Monarchs record, was second in the AHL behind Jason Spezza's 117. He was voted a starter in the 2005 AHL All-Star Game, was named to the second All-Star team and received the Willie Marshall Award for leading the league in goals.|$|E
50|$|Between 1950 and 1970, <b>labour</b> <b>disputes</b> {{nearly tripled}} in India, {{from an average}} of 1000 <b>labour</b> <b>disputes</b> per year, to an average of 3000 <b>labour</b> <b>disputes</b> per year. The number of labour {{relations}} issues within a year peaked in 1973 at 3,370 <b>labour</b> <b>disputes.</b> The number of workers who joined <b>labour</b> <b>disputes</b> within the same year, and stopped work, peaked in 1979, at 2.9 million workers. The number of lost man-days from labour relation issues peaked in 1982 at 74.6 million lost man-days, or about 2.7% of total man-days in organised sector. While the 1970s experienced a spike in <b>labour</b> unions and <b>disputes,</b> a sudden reduction in <b>labour</b> <b>disputes</b> was observed during 1975-1977, when Indira Gandhi, then prime minister, declared an emergency and amongst other things suspended many civil rights including the worker's right to strike.|$|R

5|$|The Flames {{would not}} raise their Western Conference {{championship}} banner for nearly 15 months, as the 2004–05 season was {{wiped out by}} a <b>labour</b> <b>dispute.</b> During the lock-out, team owner {{and chairman of the}} board, Harley Hotchkiss, attempted to save the season by engaging in discussions with National Hockey League Players Association president Trevor Linden. While their discussions failed to save the season, Hotchkiss was credited with easing tensions that allowed for a successful negotiation of a new collective bargaining agreement.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, shortened {{due to the}} 1994–95 <b>labour</b> <b>dispute,</b> {{he continued}} to split playing time between the NHL and IHL. In 14games with Pittsburgh, he scored two goals and four points, while recording seven points in seven games with Cleveland. He did {{not appear in the}} NHL playoffs for a second straight season, despite the Penguins qualifying. Instead, he was assigned to Cleveland for their playoff season, in which he recorded four points in four games. Frustrated by his ongoing demotions to the IHL, at one point during the season he requested to be traded from Pittsburgh.|$|E

He declined {{the chance to play}} professional lacrosse. When NHL play resumed in 2005–06, Roberts and Nieuwendyk each signed a two-year deal with the Florida Panthers. The pair, who were teammates in Toronto as well as Calgary, hoped to end their careers together in Florida. It did not happen, as chronic back pain forced Nieuwendyk's retirement in December 2006.|$|E

5|$|Following the Draft, the 1994–95 NHL {{season was}} {{suspended}} for three-and-a-half months due to a <b>labour</b> <b>dispute</b> between NHL players and owners. Consequently, Jovanovski remained in junior {{for the beginning of}} the 1994–95 OHL season. When NHL was set to resume play in January 1995, it was speculated that the Panthers might sign Jovanovski and call him up to the NHL. However, then-Panthers General Manager Bryan Murray announced that Jovanovski would remain with Windsor, citing that he would likely not receive much playing time with the club. He averaged approximately 40 minutes per game with Windsor that season, scoring 23 goals and 65 points over 50 contests. He also added nine points in nine playoff games before Windsor was eliminated. Jovanovski was named to the OHL First All-Star Team.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{my thesis}} is to analyse {{the limits of}} arbitrability of <b>labour</b> <b>disputes</b> in Czech Republic and to {{describe}} Austrian labour-arbitration law. Subsequently I would like to focus on possible solutions of problems linked with arbitrability of <b>labour</b> <b>disputes</b> in Czech Republic. The reason for this study is my interest in both Czech and international arbitration. There {{is only a few}} papers which deals with arbitrability of <b>labour</b> <b>disputes</b> in Czech Republic although it is in my opinion very interesting and controversial topic. In connection with changes, introduced by the new Civil Code on 1 st of January 2014, the Czech civil law is much more similar to the German and Austrian civil law than it was before. Due to this fact I focus on Austrian arbitration act, which could be important source of knowledge for amendments to Czech arbitration act. The thesis is composed of eight main chapters. The first chapter discusses arbitration in general. The second and third chapter describes alternative dispute resolutions and some other types of out-of-court settlements of both collective and individual <b>labour</b> <b>disputes</b> in Czech Republic. Chapter four explains arbitration and alternative resolution of <b>labour</b> <b>disputes</b> under German and Austrian acts. Chapter five provides an outline of relevant Czech case law.

The pair chose to sign with the Avalanche together in the belief it was their best chance at winning the Stanley Cup. Their hope failed to materialize, however, as Selänne endured a disastrous season in which he scored only 16 goals and 32 points—the lowest totals of his career to that date—and was ultimately relegated to Colorado's fourth line, but was also held out of the lineup as a healthy scratch during a playoff game. He struggled throughout the year with knee problems that ultimately required surgery, his third such procedure, and with the 2004–05 season canceled by a <b>labour</b> <b>dispute,</b> took the time off to recover.|$|E

5|$|When the WHA ceased {{operations}} in 1979, the NHL absorbed {{four of the}} league's teams, which brought the NHL to 21 teams, a figure that remained constant until the San Jose Sharks were added as an expansion franchise in 1991. Since then, the league has grown from 22 teams in 1992 to 31 today as the NHL spread its footprint across the United States. The league has withstood major labour conflicts in 1994–95 and 2004–05, the latter of which saw the entire 2004–05 NHL season canceled, {{the first time in}} North American history that a league has canceled an entire season in a <b>labour</b> <b>dispute.</b> Wayne Gretzky passed Gordie Howe as the NHL's all-time leading scorer in 1994 when he scored his 802nd career goal. Mario Lemieux overcame non-Hodgkin lymphoma to finish his NHL career with over 1,700 points and two Stanley Cup championships. Increased use of defence-focused systems helped cause scoring to fall in the late 1990s, leading some to argue that the NHL's talent pool had been diluted by 1990s expansion. In 1998, the NHL began awarding teams a single point for losing in overtime, hoping {{to reduce the number of}} tie games; after the 2004–05 lockout, it eliminated the tie altogether, introducing the shootout to ensure that each game has a winner.|$|E
