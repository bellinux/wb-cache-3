5|$|It {{conveyed}} a {{tenth of}} the royal demesne– the lands of the crown as opposed to the personal property of the sovereign– into the hands of churches, ecclesiastics and laymen. In Anglo-Saxon England property was either folkland or bookland. The transmission of folkland was governed by the customary rights of kinsmen, subject to the king's approval, whereas bookland was established by the grant of a royal charter, and could be disposed of freely by the owner. Booking land thus converted it by charter from folkland to bookland. The royal demesne was the crown's folkland, whereas the king's bookland was his own personal property which he could <b>leave</b> <b>by</b> <b>will</b> as he chose. In the decimation Æthelwulf may have conveyed royal folkland by charter to become bookland, in some cases to laymen who already leased the land.|$|E
50|$|In 1588 Willet {{left the}} university, and at Michaelmas, on his {{marriage}} with Jacobine, {{a daughter of}} his father's friend Roger Goad, provost of King's, gave up his fellowship. He {{earned a reputation as}} a preacher of power, especially against the Catholics. He was selected to read the lecture for three years in Ely Cathedral, and for one year in St. Paul's Cathedral, London. In the same year he was presented to the rectory of Childerly in Cambridgeshire. This living he held till 1594. He was admitted in 1597 to the rectory of Gransden Parva in Huntingdonshire, but almost immediately moved, by exchange to Barley, his father having died in April 1598 in his eighty-eighth year. He was instituted on 29 January 1599. He spent most of his ministerial life at Barley, being rector for twenty-three years. Willet's village preaching is preserved in his Thesaurus Ecclesiae (an exposition of St. John xvii.), which contains the substance of afternoon lectures addressed to his parishioners. Willet persuaded Andrew Perne to <b>leave</b> <b>by</b> <b>will</b> an annual sum to the poor scholars of the free school founded in the village of Barley by Archbishop William Warham when rector; he also influence his friend Thomas Sutton, founder of Charterhouse School.|$|E

60|$|The {{hardship}} {{amounts to}} this,--that {{the people of}} England are not taxed two shillings in the pound to pay them for teaching, as divine truths, their own particular fancies. For the state has so taxed the people; and by way of relieving these gentlemen, {{it would be a}} cruel hardship on the people to be compelled to pay, from the sweat of their brow, the most heavy of all taxes to men, to condemn as heretical the doctrines which they repute to be orthodox, and to reprobate as superstitious the practices which they use as pious and holy. If a man <b>leaves</b> <b>by</b> <b>will</b> an establishment for preaching, such as Boyle's Lectures, or for charity sermons, or funeral sermons, shall any one complain of an hardship, because he has an excellent sermon upon matrimony, or on the martyrdom of King Charles, or on the Restoration, which I, the trustee of the establishment, will not pay him for preaching?--S. Jenyns, Origin of Evil.--Such is the hardship which they complain of under the present Church establishment, that they have not the power of taxing the people of England for the maintenance of their private opinions.|$|R
50|$|In this {{extraction}} of wealth Clive followed a usage fully {{recognized by the}} company, although this {{was the source of}} future corruption which Clive was later sent to India again to correct. The company itself acquired revenue of £100,000 a year, and a contribution towards its losses and military expenditure of {{a million and a half}} sterling. Mir Jafar further discharged his debt to Clive by afterwards presenting him with the quit-rent of the company's lands in and around Calcutta, amounting to an annuity of £27,000 for life, and <b>leaving</b> him <b>by</b> <b>will</b> the sum of £70,000, which Clive devoted to the army.|$|R
50|$|In 1728, Perry Point {{was owned}} by John Perry, George Perry, Anna Templer and Dorothy Barren. In 1729, Phillip Thomas became {{the owner of the}} property, <b>leaving</b> it <b>by</b> <b>will</b> to his son Samuel Thomas in 1763, who in turn willed it to his son Richard Thomas in 1784. It was during the Thomas family {{ownership}} of the Point that the Mansion House was constructed around 1750 from bricks brought over as ballast on ships from England. The Grist Mill, which was built around the same period as the Mansion House, indicates that there was a settlement of considerable size on the Point.|$|R
