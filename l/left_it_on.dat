5|$|Bamber {{told the}} court that, during his visit on 6 August, hours before the murders, he had loaded the rifle, {{thinking}} he had heard rabbits outside, but hadn't used it. He had then <b>left</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the kitchen table, with a full magazine {{and a box of}} ammunition, before leaving the house. When he left it in the kitchen, it did not have the silencer or telescopic sight attached, he said; they had been on the rifle in late July according to a nephew, but Bamber said his father must have removed them in the meantime. The prosecution disputed this, maintaining that the silencer was on the rifle when the family was murdered.|$|E

He said he had been at the farmhouse himself a few hours earlier, and that he had loaded the rifle because he thought he had heard rabbits outside. He had <b>left</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the kitchen table fully loaded, with a box of ammunition nearby. After the bodies were discovered, a Dr. Craig, was called to the house to certify the deaths, which he testified could have occurred {{at any time during the}} night. He said Bamber appeared to be in a state of shock; Bamber broke down, cried and seemed to vomit. The doctor said Bamber told him about the discussion the family had had about possibly having Sheila's sons placed in foster care.|$|E

Impressed, the driver told Lennon of a {{harmonica}} he could have if he came to Edinburgh the following day, where one had been stored in the bus depot since a passenger <b>left</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> a bus. The professional instrument quickly replaced Lennon's toy. He would continue to play harmonica, often using the instrument during the Beatles' Hamburg years, {{and it became a}} signature sound in the group's early recordings. His mother taught him how to play the banjo, later buying him an acoustic guitar. At 16, he played rhythm guitar with the Quarrymen.|$|E

25|$|Stopping the hemorrhaging {{that was}} BAD was too little, too late, the {{magazine}} had bled the ABA white and <b>left</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> {{the verge of}} bankruptcy. On top of the BAD affair came {{the rising cost of}} the insurance crises of the early 1980s with its skyrocketing rates. This affected every sanctioning body, but given the ABA's greatly weakened state it was life-threatening to it. By 1984 the first indications of the plateauing of the popularity of BMX was the flattening growth in memberships and the falling off of attendance of nationals. Some of this was caused by the growing popularity of BMX Freestyle siphoning potential racers from BMX and the beginnings of the resurgence of skateboarding, both of which would explode in popularity by 1985.|$|E

25|$|After Habré {{was ousted}} by the rebel forces of Idriss Déby in December 1990, Nouri became a close {{ally of the}} new President and a pillar of his regime. In the {{transitional}} coalition government formed following the 1993 Sovereign National Conference, Nouri became Minister of Health under Prime Minister Fidèle Moungar. In 1995, when Koibla Djimasta was appointed as the last transitional Prime Minister, Nouri was named Minister of the Interior; while holding this post, he also chaired the Commission Nationale Recensement Électoral (CNRE), created in 1995 to organise the voter registration for the first multiparty elections in Chad since independence. Following Déby's victory in the 1996 presidential election, Nouri was moved from his post as Minister of the Interior to that of Minister for Livestock. He kept the latter post for five years; he <b>left</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> February 24, 2001, when he was appointed as Minister of National Defence in the government chaired by Nagoum Yamassoum. He left his post and the government three years later, during a cabinet reshuffle that took place on February 2, 2004. Nouri's entourage gave ill health {{as the reason for}} his departure. He was successively posted for two years to Saudi Arabia as an ambassador, until he left his position on May 6, 2006.|$|E
500|$|Madonna's {{version of}} the song begins {{with the sound of}} {{acoustic}} guitars and synth strings. Madonna's voice sounds high-pitched, eluding the deeper resonance of the tune. After the first verse, Tony Thompson starts playing the drums, which moves along the rhythm of the song. Towards the end, Madonna sings the song like a soul singer and the song ends with a gasp of breath. The song was recorded at Power Station Studio in Manhattan, New York. Rodgers recalled: [...] "Madonna had never performed with a live orchestra before. I was very much into doing everything live, so I just said, 'Madonna, you go out there and sing and we will follow you.' At first Madonna was hesitant, but the live setting ended up producing memorable results. She sang and she was overcome with emotions and she started crying, but I <b>left</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the record." ...|$|E

According to [...] writer Lucy O'Brien, De Vries and Orbit had {{originally}} composed and produced the track before Ray of Light had been conceived. During the sessions, Orbit found De Vries' contribution [...] "off-putting", to which the latter confessed, [...] "On all the collaborations I'd left {{a lot of space}} for him, but for this I wanted to put something on the table and say, 'This is what I think'". De Vries had added electronic noise frequencies during the first chorus of the song, stating that he had a [...] "vision on how the song should be finished". Orbit did not like the addition since it sounded to him that the [...] "DAT's broken". De Vries defended his contribution saying that {{it was supposed to be}} [...] "like that [...] It's quite slow for a dance tune of that nature, not a pacey tune." [...] Madonna had enjoyed all three of their contributions to the track, and as a result, Orbit reluctantly <b>left</b> <b>it</b> <b>on.</b> In J.

500|$|As the World Trade Organization (WTO) {{negotiations}} collapsed amid protests at {{a summit}} in Seattle, Trump {{appeared on the}} December 5 airing of ABC's This Week. [...] He said that the WTO was not [...] "necessarily fair" [...] to the United States, and argued that [...] "our best, and our smartest, and our brightest" [...] were not being used to negotiate the deal. [...] He renewed his attack on the negotiation skills of Barshefsky, saying that both she and Secretary of Commerce William M. Daley {{did not know how}} to negotiate. Next, Trump embarked on a two-day campaign stop in California, which the media covered extensively. [...] During the stop, Trump held a press conference, appearing with his campaign entourage that included his girlfriend Melania, Roger Stone, and bodyguard Matt Calamari. [...] Aides made hand sanitizer readily available for reporters, presumably due to Trump's alleged germaphobia. [...] The Associated Press (AP) noted that Trump [...] "made little attempt to appear statesman-like" [...] at the press conference with responses that seemed [...] "tailored more to entertain his listeners than establish his credibility." [...] In Burbank, Trump appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno where he attacked Buchanan as [...] "having a love affair with Adolf Hitler" [...] and discussed his upcoming book, The America We Deserve. [...] The Weekly Standard reported that though the release date was only a month away, the book had yet to be written. [...] After the Tonight Show appearance, Trump attended a meeting of one hundred Southern California Reform Party members, to whom he delivered a speech and answered questions. [...] Crowds cheered Trump when he discussed his opposition to NAFTA, but some were offended when he questioned the existence of a Reform Party platform and, after receiving a copy, <b>left</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the podium when he exited. [...] On the final day, Trump visited the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Museum of Tolerance and walked through an exhibit of The Holocaust. [...] He delivered a speech and held another press conference at the museum atrium, where he denounced Buchanan's views on Nazis. [...] Afterwards, Trump boarded his jet for Long Beach. [...] During an on-jet interview, Trump placed his odds of waging a full-scale campaign at [...] "50/50," [...] but [...] "edging closer," [...] believing there to be a [...] "fervor" [...] among the public about his campaign. [...] The AP evaluated the California response as more [...] "warm" [...] than fervent, but described Trump's treatment as that of a [...] "high profile dignitary." [...] At Trump's final event, he spoke at a Tony Robbins motivational conference. [...] Robbins and Trump had made an agreement that would pay Trump $1 million for showing up at ten of Robbins' events. [...] Trump planned to make campaign stops to coincide with Robbins' shows, speculating that he [...] "could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it." [...] At the event, Trump received what the AP called a [...] "moderately enthusiastic applause" [...] after asking the 21,000 people in attendance whether he should run for president. [...] He received a large ovation when he proclaimed, [...] "people want to hear straight talk. We're tired of being bullied by these moron politicians." [...] Overall, The Weekly Standard praised Trump for his candor on the campaign trail.|$|E
