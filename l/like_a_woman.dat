5|$|George Holdcroft {{composed}} the score for The FP. He {{was invited to}} a screening of the film by producer Christian Agypt, {{and asked if he}} could compose the music for it. Holdcroft, who lived in Chicago at the time, spent 12 hours a day composing the score and e-mailed his compositions to the Trost brothers. To emulate the sound of a choir for one song, Holdcroft sang the same segment more than 200 times using different voices and melodies to achieve the desired result. For another song, he sang in falsetto and altered the pitch of his voice to make himself sound <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{song was}} covered {{several times in}} 1965, {{including}} a version by The Turtles on their album It Ain't Me Babe and a version by The Walker Brothers on their album Take It Easy with The Walker Brothers. Los Angeles band The Leaves covered the song on their 1966 album Hey Joe and Joan Baez included it on her 1968 album of Dylan covers Any Day Now. A version by singer/songwriter Turley Richards became a minor hit in 1970 (US #84). It was also covered in 1993 by Judy Collins on Judy Collins Sings Dylan... Just <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> <b>Woman.</b> Eric Clapton covered the song on during Bob Dylan's 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration. Other musicians who have covered the song include Fleetwood Mac, Rod Stewart, Jackson Browne, Ricky Nelson, Buck Owens, Bridget St. John, Eliza Gilkyson, and Les Fradkin.|$|E

25|$|Houser {{is said to}} {{have entered}} Louisiana around July 2 or 3 and spent his time {{exploring}} the state along Interstate 10, apparently searching for a location to attack. During the week of July 13, Houser visited a food bank in Lake Charles twice and requested aid from them. He had been at the Grand 16 theater at least once before, and had also visited several other movie theaters in the state. According to witnesses at one theater, Houser was dressed up to look <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> and was behaving erratically. Houser also appeared to have made some getaway plans.|$|E
25|$|Pickford left Biograph in December 1910. The {{following}} year, she {{starred in}} films at Carl Laemmle's Independent Moving Pictures Company (IMP). IMP was absorbed into Universal Pictures in 1912, along with Majestic. Unhappy with their creative standards, Pickford {{returned to work}} with Griffith in 1912. Some of her best performances were in his films, such as Friends, The Mender of Nets, Just <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> <b>Woman,</b> and The Female of the Species. That year Pickford also introduced Dorothy and Lillian Gish (both friends from her days in touring melodrama) to Griffith. Both became major silent stars, in comedy and tragedy, respectively. Pickford made her last Biograph picture, The New York Hat, in late 1912.|$|E

500|$|... "Lola" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} Ray Davies and {{performed}} by English rock band the Kinks on their album Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One. The song details a romantic encounter between {{a young man and}} a [...] possible [...] transvestite, whom he meets in a club in Soho, London. In the song, the narrator describes his confusion towards a person named Lola who [...] "walked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> but talked like a man". Although Ray Davies claims that the incident was inspired by a true encounter experienced by the band's manager, alternate explanations for the song have been given by drummer Mick Avory.|$|E
500|$|According to Wilentz's {{analysis}} of the session's tapes, Dylan felt {{his way into the}} lyrics of one of his most popular songs, singing [...] "disconnected lines and semi-gibberish" [...] during the earlier takes. He was unsure what the person described in the song does that is just <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> rejecting [...] "shakes", [...] "wakes", and [...] "makes mistakes". This exploration of female wiles and feminine vulnerability was widely rumored—"not least by her acquaintances among Andy Warhol's Factory retinue"—to be about Edie Sedgwick. The reference to Baby's penchant for [...] "fog... amphetamine and... pearls" [...] suggests Sedgwick or some similar debutante, according to Heylin.|$|E
500|$|Disney had {{originally}} considered casting Jodi Benson from The Little Mermaid as Belle. They eventually decided upon Broadway actress and singer Paige O'Hara {{in favor of}} having a heroine who sounded [...] "more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> than a girl". According to co-director Kirk Wise, O'Hara was given the role because she [...] "had a unique quality, a tone she would hit that made her special", reminiscent to that of American actress and singer Judy Garland. O'Hara, who, after reading about the film in The New York Times, competed for the role against 500 hopefuls, believes the fact that lyricist Howard Ashman admired her cast recording of the musical Show Boat proved integral in her being cast.|$|E

500|$|Baxter {{was noted}} for {{accurate}} passes, for sending opponents {{the wrong way}} with a swivel of his hips, and for inspiring teammates with his confident approach. He attracted attention by his stylish play, controlling the game with [...] "unhurried artistry". He refused to conform with the [...] "efficient" [...] style that dominated British football or the energetic, physical style that was typical of Rangers at the time. Indeed, although Rangers insisted that players tuck their shirts completely into their shorts, Baxter always let part of his dangle over his left hip. He described his approach to playing football as [...] "treating the ball <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman.</b> Give it a cuddle, caress it a wee bit, take your time, and you'll get the required response".|$|E
500|$|Critics pay special {{attention}} to Bette's lack of traditional femininity, and her unconventional relationships with two characters. She is described from the outset as having [...] "des qualités d'homme" [...] ("certain manly qualities"), with similar descriptions elsewhere. Her relationship and attitude toward Steinbock, moreover, hint at her masculinity. She commands him into submission, and even binds him with economic constraints by lending him the money to develop his sculpture. Her domination is tempered by maternal compassion, but the couple's relationship is compared to an abusive marriage: [...] "Il fut comme une femme qui pardonne les mauvais traitements d'une semaine à cause des caresses d'un fugitif raccommodement." [...] ("He was <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> who forgives a week of ill-usage {{for the sake of a}} kiss and a brief reconciliation.") ...|$|E
500|$|Other {{criticism}} {{focuses on}} the potential confusion of sexuality with gender in the novel. As Jay Prosser argues, “rightly tracing Hall’s debt to nineteenth-century sexologists, critics have wrongly reduced sexual inversion to homosexuality.” What many refer to as Stephen’s ‘butch lesbianism’, Prosser suggests, is actually a transgender identity. As a child, Stephen insists that s/he is male - “Yes, of course I’m a boy…I must be a boy ‘cause I feel exactly like one,” – and, when talking to her/his mother, Stephen claims that, “All my life I’ve never felt <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> and you know it.” Through Stephen’s final rejection of Mary, ostensibly so that Mary can participate in a heterosexual relationship with Martin and therefore have a more secure life, Prosser surmises that “Stephen affirms her identification with the heterosexual man”, thus rejecting lesbianism and instead aligning her/himself with the male.|$|E
