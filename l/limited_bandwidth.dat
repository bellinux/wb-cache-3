5|$|Describing {{the system}} in November 1988, Cray stated that the 12 times {{performance}} increase would {{be made up of}} a three times increase due to GaAs circuits, and four times due to the use of more processors. One of the problems with the Cray-2 had been poor multiprocessing performance due to <b>limited</b> <b>bandwidth</b> between the processors, and to address this the Cray-3 would adopt the much faster architecture used in the Cray Y-MP. This would provide a design performance of 8000 MIPS, or 16 GFLOPS.|$|E
25|$|RTTY {{transmissions}} on LF and VLF frequencies use {{a narrow}} shift of 85Hz, {{due to the}} <b>limited</b> <b>bandwidth</b> of the antennas.|$|E
25|$|Free wi-fi {{internet}} service with <b>limited</b> <b>bandwidth</b> is provided on all trains. A two-tiered model where riders can pay extra for faster {{service is in}} planning.|$|E

50|$|The i-RAM is bottlenecked by the SATA interface, which <b>limits</b> <b>bandwidth</b> to {{a maximum}} {{sustained}} throughput of 150 MB/s. This speed limitation is offset by near instant access, with a latency of 0.1 ms.|$|R
5000|$|Many power valves {{have good}} {{linearity}} but modest gain or transconductance. Signal amplifiers using tubes {{are capable of}} very high frequency response ranges - up to radio frequency. Indeed, many of the directly heated single-ended triode (DH-SET) audio amplifiers are in fact radio transmitting tubes designed {{to operate in the}} megahertz range. In practice, however, tube amplifier designs typically [...] "couple" [...] stages either capacitively, <b>limiting</b> <b>bandwidth</b> at the low end, or inductively with transformers, <b>limiting</b> the <b>bandwidth</b> at both ends.|$|R
25|$|On {{the lowest}} end, an {{inexpensive}} hobby-grade single-channel DSO could be purchased for under $90 as of June 2011. These often have <b>limited</b> <b>bandwidth</b> and other facilities, but fulfill the basic functions of an oscilloscope.|$|E
25|$|Congestion {{occurs when}} the {{efficiency}} of a network decreases as more people use it, and this reduces the value to people already using it. Traffic congestion that overloads the freeway and network congestion over <b>limited</b> <b>bandwidth</b> both display negative network externalities.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{integrated}} FET or MOSFET op-amps approximate {{more closely}} the ideal op-amp than bipolar ICs {{when it comes}} to input impedance and input bias currents. Bipolars are generally better {{when it comes to}} input voltage offset, and often have lower noise. Generally, at room temperature, with a fairly large signal, and <b>limited</b> <b>bandwidth,</b> FET and MOSFET op-amps now offer better performance.|$|E
30|$|Data fusion {{requires}} <b>limited</b> communication <b>bandwidth.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{bandwidth}} ceilings are bandwidth diagonals placed {{below the}} idealized peak bandwidth diagonal. Their existence {{is due to}} the lack of some kind of memory related architectural optimization, such as cache coherence, or software optimization, such as poor exposure of concurrency (that in turn <b>limit</b> <b>bandwidth</b> usage).|$|R
5000|$|Traffic {{shaping and}} Rate <b>limiting</b> are <b>bandwidth</b> {{management}} (traffic control) techniques ...|$|R
25|$|Morse code {{is usually}} heard at the {{receiver}} as a medium-pitched on/off audio tone (600–1000Hz), so transmissions {{are easier to}} copy than voice through the noise on congested frequencies, {{and it can be}} used in very high noise / low signal environments. The transmitted power is concentrated into a <b>limited</b> <b>bandwidth</b> so narrow receiver filters can be used to suppress interference from adjacent frequencies. The audio tone is usually created by use of a beat frequency oscillator.|$|E
25|$|In {{practice}} {{this type of}} frequency synthesizer cannot operate over a very wide range of frequencies, because the comparator will have a <b>limited</b> <b>bandwidth</b> and may suffer from aliasing problems. This would lead to false locking situations, or an inability to lock at all. In addition, {{it is hard to}} make a high frequency VCO that operates over a very wide range. This is due to several factors, but the primary restriction is the limited capacitance range of varactor diodes. However, in most systems where a synthesizer is used, we are not after a huge range, but rather a finite number over some defined range, such as a number of radio channels in a specific band.|$|E
25|$|The eye has <b>limited</b> <b>bandwidth</b> to {{the rest}} of the visual system, {{estimated}} at just under 8 Mbit/s. This manifests itself in a number of ways, but the most important in terms of producing moving images is the way that a series of still images displayed in quick succession will appear to be continuous smooth motion. This illusion starts to work at about 16 frame/s, and common motion pictures use 24 frame/s. Television, using power from the electrical grid, tunes its rate in order to avoid interference with the alternating current being supplied – in North America, some Central and South American countries, Taiwan, Korea, part of Japan, the Philippines, and a few other countries, this is 60 video fields per second to match the 60Hz power, while in most other countries it is 50 fields per second to match the 50Hz power.|$|E
5000|$|Network bandwidth: Distributed backup {{systems can}} be {{affected}} by <b>limited</b> network <b>bandwidth.</b>|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} reports {{with respect to}} the {{statistics}} of television signals, but they have some questionable points in appling to standard TV signals. For example, E. R. Kretzmer has measured the autocorrelation function without <b>limitting</b> <b>bandwidth</b> to 5 MHz. So we have built the digital type data punching equipment, measured some statistics of picture signals, and obtained some results...|$|R

500|$|Columbia was {{the first}} North American site where the uranium atom was split. The College of Physicians and Surgeons {{played a central role}} in {{developing}} the modern understanding of neuroscience with the publication of Principles of Neural Science, described by historian of science Katja Huenther as the [...] "neuroscience 'bible'". The book was written by a team of Columbia researchers that included Nobel Prize winner Eric Kandel, James H. Schwartz, and Thomas Jessell. Columbia was the birthplace of FM radio and the laser. The MPEG-2 algorithm of transmitting high quality audio and video over <b>limited</b> <b>bandwidth</b> was developed by Dimitris Anastassiou, a Columbia professor of electrical engineering. Biologist Martin Chalfie {{was the first}} to introduce the use of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) in labeling cells in intact organisms. Other inventions and products related to Columbia include Sequential Lateral Solidification (SLS) technology for making LCDs, System Management Arts (SMARTS), Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) (which is used for audio, video, chat, instant messaging and whiteboarding), pharmacopeia, Macromodel (software for computational chemistry), a new and better recipe for glass concrete, Blue LEDs, and Beamprop (used in photonics).|$|E
2500|$|Postmodernity {{has been}} said to have gone through two {{relatively}} distinct phases the first {{beginning in the late}} 1940s and 1950s and ending with the Cold War (when analog media with <b>limited</b> <b>bandwidth</b> encouraged a few, authoritative media channels) and the second beginning {{at the end of the}} Cold War (marked by the spread of cable television and [...] "new media" [...] based on digital means of information dissemination and broadcast).|$|E
2500|$|Normally, {{the program}} starts by having Cora and Arévalo read the {{headlines}} of current news items. Don Eleuterio then joins {{in through the}} telephone (Logroño claims that the <b>limited</b> <b>bandwidth</b> of the phone call is actually preferred by the audience, rather than impersonating the character in the studio from behind a microphone). In the past, he usually started his intervention with a speech, complete with cathedral-like echo and a background rendition of [...] "The Star Spangled Banner" [...] or [...] "America The Beautiful". This only happens occasionally in recent airings of the program.|$|E

However, spherical microphone arrays perform spatial sampling {{of continuous}} functions defined on a sphere. Spatial sampling, similar to time-domain sampling, requires <b>limited</b> spatial <b>bandwidth</b> (<b>limited</b> harmonic order) to avoid aliasing [39].|$|R
5000|$|Prior to {{implementation}} of Comcast's agreements with BitTorrent, Inc., Comcast was continuing to <b>limit</b> <b>bandwidth</b> available to {{peer to peer}} applications. In April 2008, Comcast proposed a [...] "P2P Bill of Rights and Responsibilities" [...] to address potential copyright infringement by users of peer to peer applications, but some argued {{that this is an}} attempt by Comcast to strengthen its traffic management capability rather than fight copyright infringement.|$|R

2500|$|In a November 2011 interview, Dan Houser of Rockstar Games {{said that}} {{despite what the}} general public might think, Rockstar likes to [...] "spend a bit of time" [...] {{at the end of}} {{projects}} before deciding what to do next. [...] "Basically we have been meaning to start [...] for a while, but we have <b>limited</b> <b>bandwidth</b> and limited studios, and more games to make than we've started. So suddenly it was a good slot," [...] Houser said, explaining why it took eight years to follow up [...] [...] "Also, contrary to a lot of people, we like to {{take a little bit of}} time at the end of a game before starting a sequel, so we can wait for the excitement or disappointment and everything else of the experience to shake down and really see what we should do in the next game." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "New Delhi {{has very}} <b>limited</b> <b>bandwidth</b> for {{officials}} from Brussels, {{all of whom}} have important sounding titles but with often dissimilar perspectives on overlapping mandates"; asserted the former Canadian diplomat and Rector of the United Nations University (UNU) David Malone, bluntly assessing the qualitative effectiveness of elaborately crafted EU-India Joint Action Plans as : [...] "these measures lead mainly to dialogue, commitments to further dialogue, and exploratory committees and working groups, rather than to significant policy measures or economic breakthroughs.". Former French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine echoed the sentiment saying [...] "EU spends too much time issuing well meaning statements rather than dealing with the hard realities of a rough world". The former British High Commissioner to New Delhi, Sir Michael Arthur, warned that the relation with the European Union was already in a state of regress because India very much sees {{the world in terms of}} Nation states; a view shared by Shashi Tharoor, presently the Chairman of India's Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, who opined that the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) of the Institutions of the European Union has little added-value to offer India over and above what it can already obtain through bilateral relations with strategic partners in Europe (France and UK continue to be influential geopolitical players as UNSC P5 members and who when joined by Germany form the EU-3 troika which accounts for the bulk of EU-India trade). [...] "The danger is that New Delhi will write Europe off as a charming but irrelevant continent, ideal for a summer holiday but not for serious business." [...] said Tharoor and observed that India-EU relations lack substance and strategic weight on matters of core interest to India.|$|E

50|$|Usually a {{limitation}} (policer) {{is set to}} <b>limit</b> the <b>bandwidth</b> that traffic from the highest priority queue can take, {{in order to prevent}} high priority packets from choking off all other traffic. This limit is usually never reached due to high level control instances such as the Cisco Callmanager, which can be programmed to inhibit calls which would exceed the programmed <b>bandwidth</b> <b>limit.</b>|$|R

30|$|While the {{performance}} of TDOA ranging methods is inherently <b>limited</b> by the <b>bandwidth</b> of the (known) transmitted signals, correlation-based localization is only <b>limited</b> by the <b>bandwidth</b> of the (unknown) received signals, depending on communication or other wireless activities in the environment. Thus, correlation-based methods are not <b>limited</b> by scarce <b>bandwidth</b> allocations. Using wide-band receivers, a much higher ranging resolution {{can be obtained by}} simply recording ambient signals from any occupied bands. By that, {{the performance}} improves with the employed bandwidth of the receivers.|$|R
40|$|Large two-photon absorptivities are {{reported}} for symmetrical bis-donor stilbene derivatives with dialkylamino or diphenylamino groups. These molecules exhibit strong optical limiting of nanosecond pulses over a broad spectral {{range in the}} visible. Relative to bis(di-n-butylamino) stilbene, bis(diphenylamino) stilbene exhibits a 90 -nm red shift of its optical limiting band but only a minimal shift of ~ 13 nm of its lowest one-photon electronic absorption band. Mixtures of these compounds offer an unprecedented combination of broad optical <b>limiting</b> <b>bandwidth</b> and high linear transparency...|$|R
