Skill is denoted by q, where 0≤q≤1. The concept of q differs depending on interpretation. It could mean: {{the probability of a}} laborer successfully completing a task, the quality of task completion expressed as a percentage, or the quality of task completion with the condition of a margin of error that could reduce quality. Output is determined by multiplying the q values of each of the n tasks together and then multiplying this result by another term (<b>lets</b> <b>say,</b> B) denoting the individual characteristics of the firm. B is positively correlated with the number of tasks. The production function here is simple: ...|$|E
50|$|The Step 4 uses {{keys from}} Step 2 because {{we might have}} {{unbalanced}} data distribution on machines. For example, <b>lets</b> <b>say</b> k = 1, machine m1 only gets 1 item with weight 10 while machine m2 gets 2 items each with weight 100. Intuitively probability for items from m1 getting in final sample is 10/210. In Step 3, we will get 1 item from m1 as well as m2. If we recalculate keys in step 4 then the probability that item from m1 will be in final sample is 10/110 instead of required 10/210. Now observe that weighted reservoir sampling algorithm from previous section decreases max key value in priority queue as it processes more items. Therefore, items sampled from machine with larger chunk will have lower key values and thus higher chance of getting selected.|$|E

5000|$|As {{an other}} example, {{consider}} a scientific study (maybe of {{a treatment for}} some chronic disease, such as arthritis) with ten people in the treatment group and ten people in a control group.

At the end of the study, the outcome is rated into a score, for each individual (for example on a scale of mobility and pain, {{in the case of an}} arthritis study), and then all the scores are compared between the pairs. The results, as the percent of pairs that support the hypothesis, is the common language effect size. In the example study it could be (<b>lets</b> <b>say)</b> [...]80, if 80 out of the 100 comparison pairs shows a better outcome for the treatment group, than the control group, and the report may read as follows: [...] "When a patient in the treatment group was compared to a patient in the control group, in 80 of 100 pairs the treated patient showed a better treatment outcome."

50|$|Example of how over-bundling causes big {{problems}} (permutations {{and evaluation of}} total price in source selection): <b>Lets</b> <b>say</b> a requiring activity wants to get polling services. Acquisition planning reveals there are five polls in ten different regions. However, {{it turns out that}} the Government will only be ordering one of the five polls in any real numbers and that particular poll is much more expensive in actual cost than the other four. If a weighting scheme is not applied to this bundled requirement, a vendor can make the four lightly ordered polls very cheap in their offer and the high volume poll very expensive, based on their knowledge of the ordering patterns of the Government in past acquisitions. Thus, on its face, the overall price of a bid when each poll is added together to arrive at a total price (used in source selection) would look attractive but in practice, the Government will burn through its budget very quickly given the vast majority of the actually ordered polls are extremely expensive (even though the actual cost of the most frequently ordered poll is far less than what was in the offer). To avoid the headache of a weighting scheme, all five polls should be broken apart and contracted for separately so they can be judged on their merits. This is an example of what is frequently done on major indefinite duration, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts and explains why some acquisitions are appallingly expensive and require additional funding to achieve the requiring activity's objectives.|$|E
