25|$|The {{simplest}} ballast for {{alternating current}} (AC) use is an inductor placed in series, consisting of a winding on a <b>laminated</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>core.</b> The inductance of this winding limits the flow of AC current. This type is still used, for example, in 120 volt operated desk lamps using relatively short lamps. Ballasts are rated for the size of lamp and power frequency. Where the AC voltage is insufficient to start long fluorescent lamps, the ballast is often a step-up autotransformer with substantial leakage inductance (so as to limit the current flow). Either form of inductive ballast may also include a capacitor for power factor correction.|$|E

Most of new <b>laminated</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>core</b> designs {{are found to}} have significant shortcomings resulted from design and technological features of their manufacturing.

50|$|<b>Laminated</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>cores</b> {{are made}} of stacks of thin iron sheets coated with an {{insulating}} layer, lying {{as much as possible}} parallel with the lines of flux. The layers of insulation serve as a barrier to eddy currents, so eddy currents can only flow in narrow loops within the thickness of each single lamination. Since the current in an eddy current loop is proportional to the area of the loop, this prevents most of the current from flowing, reducing eddy currents to a very small level. Since power dissipated is proportional to the square of the current, breaking a large core into narrow laminations reduces the power losses drastically. From this, {{it can be seen that}} the thinner the laminations, the lower the eddy current losses.|$|R
50|$|By Lenz's law, an {{eddy current}} creates a {{magnetic}} field that opposes {{a change in the}} magnetic field that created it, and thus eddy currents react back on the source of the magnetic field. For example, a nearby conductive surface will exert a drag force on a moving magnet that opposes its motion, due to eddy currents induced in the surface by the moving magnetic field. This effect is employed in eddy current brakes which are used to stop rotating power tools quickly when they are turned off. The current flowing through the resistance of the conductor also dissipates energy as heat in the material. Thus eddy currents are a cause of energy loss in alternating current (AC) inductors, transformers, electric motors and generators, and other AC machinery, requiring special construction such as <b>laminated</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>cores</b> or ferrite cores to minimize them. Eddy currents are also used to heat objects in induction heating furnaces and equipment, and to detect cracks and flaws in metal parts using eddy-current testing instruments.|$|R

40|$|Today's {{electrical}} energy conversion devices, such as motors, transformers, inductors and generators, {{are based on}} <b>laminated</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>cores</b> for reduction of eddy current losses, imposing a two-dimensional magnetic flux distribution. Using a three-dimensional magnetic flux distribution while maintaining low magnetic losses requires new approaches to <b>magnetic</b> <b>core</b> materials. Soft <b>Magnetic</b> Composites, SMC's, are compounds consisting of magnetic iron particles coated with a thin and electrically insulating layer. Compacting and shaping such particles without reducing {{the effectiveness of the}} electrical insulation layer, while maintaining the magnetic characteristics, presents a major challenge. Furthermore, new motor designs taking into account the new possibilities of SMC's have been investigated only sparingly. The state-of-the-art SMC material today does not meet current requirements. Additional efforts are needed in the following three areas: CVD powder coating processes (for electrical insulation), bulk material characterisation methods (evaluation of magnetic, structural and mechanical bulk properties) and compaction/tooling processes (for bulk material/application production). The goals for the research study included an extensive literature research, the task to design and build a fluidising bed reactor CVD (FBRCVD) system and an exploration of the possibilities to deposit standard qualities of iron powder with various metal oxide films. In the literature research, it was concluded that the amount of published work pertaining to FBRCVD was rather scarce. It was shown that an FBRCVD apparatus could be designed and built. Furthermore, it was shown that TiO 2 successfully could be deposited onto the iron powder in the CVD apparatus.

40|$|Soft {{metallic}} magnetic alloys (such as Co, Ni and Fe based alloys) {{have been}} extensively used as core material in integrated inductors and transformers for DC–DC conversion. Although these materials have excellent soft magnetic properties {{such as high}} saturation flux density, low coercivity and high permeability; high electronic conductivity makes them susceptible to eddy current losses. As a result, core material thickness is often limited by the skin depth which in turn reduces the inductance density. <b>Laminated</b> <b>magnetic</b> films, where the active layers are separated by a dielectric film can increase the overall core thickness without compromising on its power handling capability.

40|$|<b>Laminated</b> soft <b>magnetic</b> <b>cores</b> of transformers, {{rotating}} machines etc. may exhibit complex 3 D flux distributions with pronounced normal fluxes (off-plane fluxes), {{perpendicular to}} the plane of magnetization. As recent research activities have shown, detections of off-plane fluxes tend to be essential for the optimization of core performances aiming at a reduction of core losses and of audible noise. Conventional sensors for off-plane flux measurements tend to be either of high thickness, influencing the measured fluxes significantly, or require laborious preparations. In the current work, thin novel detector bands for effective and simple off-plane flux detections in laminated machine cores were manufactured. They are printed in an automatic way by an in-house developed 3 D/ 2 D assembler. The latter enables a unique combination of conductive and non-conductive materials.

40|$|Frequency {{converters}} {{are used}} to operate machines at speeds that are optimal for the process, thus allowing a high efficiency. Frequency converters help save energy but by doing so they also pollute the grid and cause disturbances. These disturbances {{can be seen in}} the grid current waveform as harmonic components. The most common way to mitigate harmonic current is to add inductance to the input of the converter by using a choke. In order to obtain a high efficiency for a choke, the design needs to be optimized. High efficiency needs to be obtained without increasing the size and cost of the choke. In DC and low frequency applications, most of the power losses occur in the windings of the inductor. Optimization process should be targeted to total wire DC-resistance. Small number of turns and large cross-sectional area are needed to achieve the goal. Different core shapes and winding methods can be used to achieve the best result. Several design constraint drive the design process. In high power applications high saturation current is usually needed. This means that <b>laminated</b> <b>magnetic</b> steel <b>core</b> is usually used due to the material’s high saturation flux density. Three different designs and prototypes are introduced in this thesis. All of the designs utilize different winding methods and core shapes.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} seemingly inevitable compromise between modeling fidelity and simulation speed in power electronics. Higher-order effects are considered at the component and system levels. Order-reduction techniques {{are applied to}} provide insight into accurate, computationally efficient component-level (via reduced-order physics-based model) and system-level simulations (via multiresolution simulation). Proposed high-order models, verified with hardware measurements, are, in turn, used to verify the accuracy of final reduced-order models for both small- and large-signal excitations. At the component level, dynamic high-fidelity magnetic equivalent circuits are introduced for <b>laminated</b> and solid <b>magnetic</b> <b>cores.</b> Automated linear and nonlinear order-reduction techniques are introduced for linear magnetic systems, saturated systems, systems with relative motion, and multiple-winding systems, to extract the desired essential system dynamics. Finite-element models of magnetic components incorporating relative motion are set forth and then reduced. At the system level, a framework for multiresolution simulation of switching converters is developed. Multiresolution simulation provides an alternative method to analyze power converters by providing an appropriate amount of detail based on the time scale and phenomenon being considered. A detailed full-order converter model is built based upon high-order component models and accurate switching transitions. Efficient order-reduction techniques are used to extract several lower-order models for the desired resolution of the simulation. This simulation framework is extended to higher-order converters, converters with nonlinear elements, and closed-loop systems. The resulting rapid-to-integrate component models and flexible simulation frameworks could form the computational core of future virtual prototyping design and analysis environments for energy processing units...|$|R
