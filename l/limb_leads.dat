40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to derive the normal limits of a new ECG lead system aimed at enhancing the amplitude of atrial potentials through the use of bipolar chest leads. Methods: Sixty healthy male subjects, mean age 38. 85 ± 8. 76 years (range 25 to 58 years) were included in this study. In addition to a standard 12 -lead ECG, a modified <b>limb</b> <b>lead</b> (MLL) ECG was recorded for 60 sec with the RA electrode placed in the 3 rd right intercostal space slightly {{to the left of the}} mid-clavicular line, the LA electrode placed in the 5 th right intercostal space slightly to the right of the mid-clavicular line and the LL electrode placed in the 5 th right intercostal space on the mid- clavicular line. Results: In the frontal plane, the modification of limb electrode positions produced significant changes compared to standard <b>limb</b> <b>lead</b> I and II. The mean P wave amplitude was 111 ± 17 μV in MLL I and 64 ± 16 μV in standard <b>limb</b> <b>lead</b> (SLL) I (p< 0. 001). Similarly it was 118 ± 22 μV in MLL II and 100 ± 27 μV in SLL II. No statistically significant changes were seen in V 1 -V 6 due to modification of the Wilson central terminal electrode positions. Conclusion: The modification of <b>limb</b> electrode placement <b>leads</b> to changes in the amplitude of the P waves in the MLL leads I and II compared to SLL leads I and II in healthy subjects. These changes may be of importance in the detection of atrial electrical activity...|$|R

25|$|As well as medication, {{rehabilitation}} programmes {{and surgical}} interventions, {{the application of}} biomechanical loading on tremor movement {{has been shown to}} be a technique that is able to suppress the effects of tremor on the human body. It has been established in the literature that most of the different types of tremor respond to biomechanical loading. In particular, it has been clinically tested that the increase of damping and/or inertia in the upper <b>limb</b> <b>leads</b> to a reduction of the tremorous motion. Biomechanical loading relies on an external device that either passively or actively acts mechanically in parallel to the upper limb to counteract tremor movement. This phenomenon gives rise to the possibility of an orthotic management of tremor.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{examine the}} effects of induced {{pluripotent}} stem cell(iPSc) transplantation on the Q-T interval of acute myocardiac infarction rats,and to conduct a basic evaluation on its safety and effectiveness. Methods Acute myocardiac infarction(AMI) model rats were prepared and divided randomly into AMI group,AMI + normal saline(AMI+NS) group,AMI+iPSc(AMI+iPSc) group,and AMI + fibroblast(AMI+Fb) group. Each group was assigned 15 rats,whereas 20 rats were assigned to the normal control group. The change on the Q-T interval of the <b>limb</b> <b>lead</b> II surface electrocardiogram(ECG) of every group was examined by BL- 420 biological function system at 5 min, 1 week, 2 weeks,and 3 weeks after iPSc transplantation. The expression of Connexin 43 in the rats was examined by immunohistochemistry. Semi-quantitative analysis was carried out by Image Proplus software. Results Two weeks after transplantation,the Q-T interval of the <b>limb</b> <b>lead</b> II surface ECG of the AMI+iPSc group is shorter than those of the AMI and AMI+Fb groups. The difference between the first two groups has no statistical significance. Similar trend in the changes that occurred in the experiment is observed three and two weeks after transplantation. Conclusions Two weeks after iPSc transplantation,the Q-T interval of rats after myocardiac infarction is shortened,which leads to improved electrical activity and elevated potential stability of cardiac tissues.

40|$|AIMS: Electrocardiographic (ECG) {{changes in}} {{patients}} with ascites are not well studied. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate ECG changes {{in patients with}} ascites. METHODS AND RESULTS: Prospective analysis of patients with ascites who were referred for paracentesis. Three ECGs were recorded before paracentesis. ECG 1 was a standard 12 -lead ECG. For ECG 2 the precordial leads were placed 1 intercostal space (ICS) and for ECG 3, 2 ICS cranially. The sums (Sigma) of the QRS in ECG 1 were compared with ECG 2 and 3. In six patients the same ECG protocol was performed after removal of ascites. Ten hospitalized patients without ascites served as controls. Twenty patients with ascites were analysed. <b>Limbs</b> <b>leads</b> low voltage was present in 11 patients and precordial low voltage in four patients. Cranial placement of the precordial electrodes increased SigmaQRS in all patients with ascites. The most prominent voltage changes appeared in the leads V 4 -V 6 (+ 62 %). Paracentesis of ascites normalized precordial <b>leads</b> low-voltage, while <b>limbs</b> <b>leads</b> low voltage remained. Cranial placement of the precordial electrodes in patients without ascites decreases SigmaV 1 -V 6. CONCLUSION: We describe a phenomenon of precordial voltage changes in patients with ascites, not reported in the literature yet. By placing the precordial electrodes 1 and 2 ICS cranially the voltage changes can be 'corrected' and this should be done in all patients prior to further diagnostic workup.

40|$|Configurations and {{calculations}} in the <b>limb</b> <b>lead</b> {{were conducted}} in normal horses {{as a part of}} project in electrocardiographic studies. The results thus obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Cardiac displacement may be observed in the <b>limb</b> <b>lead</b> by the directions of recordings of R_ and R_ waves. Although 40 % of dropped heart and 30 % of transversed heart were observed, 30 % could not be classified to any types. 2. The intricate triphasic waves in P wave were found in from 70 to 80 %. Appearance of this type was found usually in normal horses in the <b>limb</b> <b>lead.</b> 3. Isoelectric waves in the PR(PQ) were shown in from 70 to 80 %, but other cases indicated descending, ascending and vibratory. No appearances of isoelectric waves were ever found in the latter cases, except for the presence of disturbances, in the results of calculations of PR(PQ) intervals. Therefore, it will be thought that the measurement of PR(PQ) intervals in disturbances of auriculoventricular conduction has an important significance. 4. Notchings on the down or upstroke were found 20 % in R_I, 10 % in R_ and 20 % in R_, and then, notchings of the apex of R waves in R_ and R_ were seen 20 and 30 % respectively. The appearance of notching in negative R, except for R_I, seemed to have some correlations with the cardiac displacement. 5. Arc curved S waves were found in 80 % in lead I, 66 % in lead II and 90 % in lead III. They appeared on the terminal part of the downstroke of R and succeeded to RS-T segments. 6. In RS-T segments or junctions, each 60 % in leads I and II, and 80 % in lead III indicated isoelectric types. In other cases were found the types of descending, ascending and slight vibratory to the zero line. 7. Monophasic negative waves were always observed in the T wave of lead I. In leads II and III, 66 and 90 % of them indicated monophasic positive waves. Other cases were the diphasic which showed positive deflections after negative. 8. The amplitudes in each wave were higher in the mean values than those of LANNEK & RUTQVIST. The authors considered that such results may be ascribed to the position differences of electrodes.

40|$|Twenty-one Shepherd {{dogs and}} 22 Karafuto dogs were examined. <b>Limb</b> <b>lead</b> (I, II&III), {{unipolar}} <b>limb</b> <b>lead</b> (aVR, aVL&aVF) and unipolar chest lead (V 1 ∿V 6) were employed for these experiments. Classification {{was made of}} waves and measurements of each wave of each lead. The results are summarized as follows; 1. Arrhythmia was seen in 15 out of 21 cases in the S dogs and in 20 out of 22 cases in the K dogs. All of the arrhythmia were sinus arrhythmia including some cases of respiratory arrhythmia. The cases of sinus arrhythmia showed clinically abnormal heart sound. 2. Electrocardiogram of S dogs traced by three different kinds of lead methods are as follows. P wave mostly showed positive in each lead except for negative waves in leads aVR and V 1. PQ segment always showed flat wave paralleled with 0 -line except the waves in some cases of leads II and aVR. QRS complex may be divided into 12 types. Through out all lead recordings, qR type was mostly observed with R and Rs types being second. But the QRS complex which was constructed of only Q and S waves were observed in leads aVR, aVL and V 1. Further, no S wave was seen in leads II and aVF, and no Q wave was observed in V 3 and V 4. ST segment mostly showed the flat wave and upward waves. T wave showed mainly positive form but diphasic type was sometimes seen. Notching formation on QRS complex was traced mostly on the downward deflection of R and secondly on top of R waves. Close relation may be recognized between the form of ST segment and direction of deflection of T wave. 3. Electrocardiogram of K dogs are characterized as follows. P wave in most cases showed positive wave excepting negative one in leads aVR and V 1. PQ segment showed flat wave in <b>limb</b> <b>lead,</b> aVL and aVF, but in recordings from the unipolar chest lead the segment showed downward deflection. QRS complex may be classified into 12 types. Rs and RS types were mostly seen but the QRS in aVR and aVL was mainly constructed of Q and S waves. In the unipolar chest lead, Q waves were not observed in recording of V 3. Upward deflection and 0 -line type of ST in <b>limb</b> <b>lead,</b> downward in aVL&aVR, and upward in unipolar chest lead were respectively observed. Positive T waves were observed in most cases, but in aVR and aVL the T waves showed negative. Notchings on QRS were usually found on the downward deflection of R and next most frequently on upward deflection of R. In regard {{to the relationship between}} the forms of ST and T waves, same conclusions were reached as in the S dogs. 4. Some differences were observed between the electrocardiograms of S and K dogs, which were concerned with figure and measurement value of each wave in each lead. But fundamental differences were not observed electrocardiographically. 5. In regard to the clinical application of the electrocardiogram on dogs, the authors considered that the electrocardiograph is a useful instrument for diagnose of the heart conditions. First of all fixing method is important : the writers consider it best to put the dog on his back with extremities bandaged to the table, because the movement of the dog may be prevented during the recording of the electrocardiogram. The needle electrode is useful. The electrode is applied to the subcutaneous area under the lead position, then for some time the electrode should be kept as it is, so the injury current may be destroyed and no influence of injury currents may be recognized in the traced wave. It is needful for diagnosis of the heart condition that recording of the electrocardiogram should be made by many leads as possible. But in clinic many leads are not applied to the patient. Therefore, authors consider it practical and useful for clinical examination that diagnosis of arrhythmia be conducted by lead II of the <b>limb</b> <b>lead,</b> and then that unipolar lead be used to learn about the positional changes of the heart. Records from the unipolar chest lead are valuable for learning about the heart muscle condition especially to ascertain if there have been damages to the ventriclar muscles...|$|R

40|$|In {{connection}} with the serial electrocardiogram recorded {{by means of the}} <b>limb</b> <b>lead,</b> bipolar chest leads I and II and semi-unipolar chest lead were obtained on one each of 40 normal dairy cattle. The data derived from the analysis of these records can be summarized as follows : 1. In the electrocardiogram of the <b>limb</b> <b>lead</b> when the left and right olecranons and left patella were chosen for the positions of lead points, the triphasic and diphasic P wave in each lead, r type of QRS complex in lead I and R type in leads II and III, and monophasic negative and positive T waves are observed, respectively. 2. In case of the use of the bipolar chest lead I in which the left and right olecranons and withers were selected for the lead points, the triphasic P wave, qR and R type of QRS complex and monophasic negative T waves were observed in each lead respectively. 3. When the bipolar chest lead II was employed using the withers, left shoulder blade and the apex of the heart on the left side for the lead points, W form of P wave in each lead, qR type in leads I and II, and qR, QR in lead III, and monophasic negative T wave in leads I and II, monophasic positive and diphasic waves in lead III were observed respectively. 4. In case of the use of the semi-unipolar chest lead, the waves in the lead at the upper portion of the heart showed negative P, and R type of QRS complex and negative T waves were also observed there. On the contrary in the lead at the apical portion of the heart, the positive P and QS type of QRS complex and positive T wave were traced. 5. On the basis of these experiments, the <b>limb</b> <b>lead</b> may not be suitable for clinical use in cattle because the variation of the electrical changes of the heart was not completely traced. The bipolar chest leads I and II, however, may be applicable for clinic use, for the variation of the electrical changes of the heart were apparentely registered on the electrocardiogram. The semi-unipolar chest lead may be of use in the diagnosis of disorders in the heart providing that different electrodes are placed close to the heart. From the findings described above, it may be considered that the use of bipolar chest leads I and II together with semi-unipolar chest lead is valuable for the clinical diagnosis of heart disorders...|$|R

40|$|Visualization of {{the cardiac}} {{potential}} movement {{is important in}} understanding the physiology of the human heart. A 3 D visualization tool will help the cardiology students and others interested in human physiology to understand {{the functioning of the}} heart. In this thesis, such a tool is proposed which helps in the visualization of the cardiac potential movement and Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC) event on a 3 D heart model. The cardiac excitation obtained from a <b>limb</b> <b>lead</b> and a precordial lead of a 12 lead electrocardiograph (ECG) is mapped on a 3 D heart model with fixed conduction pathways. The 3 D heart model is obtained by modifying an existing anatomically accurate heart model. Fixed conduction pathways are defined on this derived 3 D heart model. Each component of the ECG corresponds to the potential movement along each segment of these conduction pathways. The timing information from the <b>limb</b> <b>lead</b> signal is used to map the position of the cardiac potential on these conduction pathways. Amplitude and the timing information obtained from the precordial lead is mapped on a vector which points towards the corresponding precordial electrode on a separate window. This helps in understanding the instantaneous position of the cardiac potential on the transverse plane. Mapping of the cardiac excitation on the conduction pathways will stop and the color map of the heart will change during the occurrence of a PVC event. MIT-BIH arrhythmia database signals with at least one PVC wave were considered as input signal. It is observed that the system was able to detect PVC approximately 95 % of the time (for the selected sample signals) and was able to map each ECG component accurately on the conduction pathways with minimum mapping delay...|$|R
