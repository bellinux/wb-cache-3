[...] He told Miami New Timess Crossfade that [...] "I think Christian is a wonderful noun, but a terrible adjective. Are there Christian shoes, Christian clothes, Christian plumbers, Christian pipes? I think if you're going to, you should label it hip-hop... hip-hop is a particular poetic style. Labeling it with the faith assumes that the song {{is going to be}} some kind of sermon, but there's a lot of social and political things that I don't think make it gospel or Christian music." [...] He also stated, [...] "I like to wrap my mind around a total situation. I'm a social anthropologist.

60|$|With all his {{attention}} bent {{in this new}} direction, Darwin soon noticed that a good deal was occurring in an entirely unmystical and even unmeaning way of which the older speculative Deist-Evolutionists had taken little or no account. Nowadays, when we are turning in weary disgust and disillusion from Neo-Darwinism and Mechanism to Vitalism and Creative Evolution, {{it is difficult to}} imagine how this new departure of Darwin's could possibly have appealed to his contemporaries as exciting, agreeable, above all as hopeful. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> therefore <b>try</b> <b>to</b> bring back something of the atmosphere of that time by describing a scene, very characteristic of its superstitions, in which I took what was then considered an unspeakably shocking part.|$|R
30|$|If status rights – remuneration, {{intrinsic}} job quality, security – are {{the main}} components of the dependent variable, what are the components of the independent variable? Leaving aside the important question of how the remuneration of investors, entrepreneurs, and managers is to be explained and justified (standard answers refer to the need to compensate them for refraining from consumption, to dividends being a premium for the risks they undergo, or to rewards for the performance of highly skilled and demanding entrepreneurial tasks), I  concentrate on the remuneration and other aspects of the organizational status of non-managerial employees. The determinants that enter into the negotiation and definition of their hierarchical status include skills, experience, seniority, gender, time, and “responsibility”. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> briefly <b>try</b> <b>to</b> disentangle some of the ambiguities inherent in this set of independent variables.|$|R

60|$|I placed {{before you}} in a few words, some little time ago, a {{statement}} of the sum and substance of Milton's hypothesis. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> now <b>try</b> <b>to</b> state as briefly, the effect of the circumstantial evidence bearing upon the past history of the earth which is furnished, without the possibility of mistake, with no chance of error as to its chief features, by the stratified rocks. What we find is, that the great series of formations represents a period of time of which our human chronologies hardly afford us a unit of measure. I will not pretend to say how we ought to estimate this time, in millions or in billions of years. For my purpose, the determination of its absolute duration is wholly unessential. But that the time was enormous there can be no question.|$|R
40|$|Of course, {{the easy}} {{answer to this}} {{question}} is: Because there is almost no freedom of assembly in China and there are big restrictions on freedom of expression. But I have started to realize that this answer is too simple. The people I have been talking to, even well-educated and international people, have a gut reaction to the idea of public protests that is unfavorable. I have been discussing the issue of protests during the Olympic Games with Chinese colleagues, friends, and acquaintances from academic, government, and corporate backgrounds. The people whose views I summarize here are college-educated (in China), middle-class, internationally-informed (but not educated abroad), and between the ages of 30 and 55. I would guess that their political stance is close to the mainstream (though since Chinese people don’t vote for top leaders, there’s no clear barometer of their political stances like “Republican” or “Democrat”). Some of them expressed that the protests surrounding the torch relay presented a new view of the West, because they did not fully understand that such protests are common there. My guess is that while they knew about them, perhaps they had never seen so many visual images on TV and in the media. However, {{it seems to me that}} the way in which this coverage was handled in China left many people with the false impression that protests like these occur in London and Paris nearly every day, a portrait they regard with distaste. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> outline the system of beliefs that produces this reaction...|$|R

I suppose that you sent for me to know whether Mr. Gaylord has employed me to lobby for his bill. He has not, because I refused that employment. But I will tell you that, in my opinion, if a man of any ability whatever should get up on the floor of the House and make an argument for the Pingsquit bill, the sentiment against the Northeastern and its political power is so great that the House would compel the committee to report the bill, and pass it. You probably know this already, but I mention it for your own good if you do not, in the hope that, through you, the Northeastern Railroads may be induced to relax their grip upon the government of this State." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 30. All this we {{have from}} the legends of the {{historic}} Æolus only; but, besides these, there is the beautiful story of Semele, the mother of Bacchus. She is the cloud with {{the strength of the}} vine in its bosom, consumed by the light which matures the fruit; the melting away of the cloud into the clean air at the fringe of its edges being exquisitely rendered by Pindar's epithet for her, Semele, [...] "with the stretched-out hair" [...] ('tauuetheira'.) Then there is the entire tradition of the Danaides, and of the tower of Danaë and golden shower; the birth of Perseus connecting this legend with that of the Gorgons and Graiæ, who are the true clouds of thunderous ruin and tempest. I must, in passing, mark for you that the form of the sword or sickle of Perseus, with which he kills Medusa, is another image of the whirling harpy vortex, and belongs especially to the sword of destruction or annihilation; whence it is given to the two angels who gather for destruction the evil harvest and evil vintage of the earth (Rev. xiv. 15). I will collect afterwards and complete what I have already written respecting the Pegasean and Gorgonian legends, noting here only what is necessary to explain the central myth of Athena herself, who represents the ambient air, which included all cloud, and rain, and dew, and darkness, and peace, and wrath of heaven. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> now <b>try</b> <b>to</b> give you, however briefly, some distinct idea of the several agencies of this great goddess.|$|R

The objective {{of this study is to}} analyze the movie in terms of its structural elements and to analyze the <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> In movie based on the feminist perspective. The research is qualitative study. The researcher uses two data sources: primary data source and secondary data source. The secondary data are taken from several references such as articles, website about the movie, commentaries, and other about the author on feminism material to support the subject matter. The data collection method is library research by collecting both primary and secondary data. The data analysis method is descriptive qualitative analysis based on feminism approach. The results of the study show; firstly, Matt Reeves wants to illustrate how women are subordinated and exploited in patriarchal society. Secondly, in this <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> In movie, it can be seen from Abby’s condition where she always struggles to keep her relationship and also her love on Owen.
