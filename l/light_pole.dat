5|$|Latouche-Tréville was recommissioned on 15 February 1907 and {{assigned}} to the gunnery school. The following month, her torpedo tubes were removed. On 22 September 1908, her aft turret was badly damaged when one of her loaded guns misfired when the breech was opened. The ignition of the propellant blew the breechblock through the turret door and threw the sighting hood onto the ship's deck. The ship was saved from being lost by a crewman who closed the door between the magazine and the ammunition hoist. Fourteen crewmen were killed and five were wounded in the incident. Repairs took {{until the end of}} the year to complete, and she resumed her duties until she was again placed in reserve on 1 January 1912. Latouche-Tréville was recommissioned on 20 November for service in the Levant; she departed Toulon on 10 December and arrived in Port Said, Egypt on 16 December. The ship was refitted in Bizerta, Tunisia, from 8 November 1913 to 26 December, during which time her military masts were replaced by <b>light</b> <b>pole</b> masts. She arrived back in Egypt on 30 December and resumed her duties.|$|E
25|$|As {{had been}} tested in the wartime cruiser , whose {{completion}} had been delayed post-war, the Counties featured a new design of forward superstructure incorporating the navigating bridge, wheelhouse, signalling and compass platforms and gunnery director in a single block. This advance considerably rationalised the separate armoured conning tower and myriad of decks and platforms of older designs. Moving the fire-control equipment from the mast negated {{the need for a}} heavy tripod, and <b>light</b> <b>pole</b> masts sufficed for signalling yards and the spread of wireless antennae.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Street {{lighting}} system {{is an essential}} structure {{for the safety of}} traffic. Most of the <b>lighting</b> <b>pole</b> is made of steel and it is vulnerable to corrosion due to its hazardous surrounding environment. To mitigate such corrosion problems, stainless steel and iron steel are usually adopted, but they are also usually manufactured by hand, so it is not economical. Therefore, to overcome such problems new type FRP <b>lighting</b> <b>pole</b> is proposed. In recent years, FRP materials in the construction market are popularly utilized as an alternative for conventional construction materials. FRP material is known to have many advantages such as high chemical resistance, electro-magnetic transparency, high specific strength and stiffness, etc. In this paper, structural behavior of FRP <b>lighting</b> <b>pole</b> is compared with that of conventional <b>lighting</b> <b>pole</b> structures and we proposed the cross-section configuration of the FRP <b>lighting</b> <b>pole</b> with details on the manufacturing procedure...|$|R

25|$|On 7 May 1967 Bandini {{was racing}} at the Monaco Grand Prix, running second to Denny Hulme on the 82nd lap, {{when he lost}} control of his car at the harbour chicane. He had just entered the chicane when his Ferrari's left rear wheel hit the guard rail, sending him into an erratic skid. It {{impacted}} a <b>light</b> <b>pole</b> and overturned. The car hit straw bales which lined the harbour side, rupturing the fuel tank, and sparks ignited the fuel as the car rolled over, with Bandini trapped beneath it. Marshals flipped his car upright and pulled Bandini, unconscious, out from the flaming Ferrari. It is thought that, during the effort to right the overturned car, fuel leaked on the hot brake line or the exhaust pipe and exploded. A second fire occurred when the fuel tank exploded after Bandini had been {{pulled away from the}} Ferrari.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Under {{excitation}} from wind, highway <b>lighting</b> <b>poles</b> {{of various}} types have exhibited problematic vibrations. Previous study of these vibrations and the consequent fatigue and failure of the structures was primarily based on analytical formulation and laboratory tests, and the effort {{has been focused on}} some specific perceived types of oscillations. The prototype aerodynamic behavior of <b>lighting</b> <b>pole</b> structures still need to be further investigated. This paper presents an interpretation of the <b>lighting</b> <b>pole</b> vibrations observed through a long-term full-scale measurement project. Based on this interpretation, the excitation mechanisms that induced the vibrations were identified. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Fatigue {{cracking}} {{reported in}} a <b>lighting</b> <b>pole</b> on an elevated bridge structure near Wellington {{raised the question of}} how to better design for and predict the fatigue life of <b>lighting</b> <b>poles</b> subject to wind induced fatigue. There have been concerns as to the reliability and currency of the methods commonly used in New Zealand. The paper therefore reviews current international design methods and describes the development of an improved fatigue design method for <b>lighting</b> <b>poles</b> in New Zealand. The new method uses fracture mechanics based crack growth formulations in conjunction with a modified J. D. Holmes Method for wind response analysis of the pole to varying wind speeds. Cumulative crack growth is calculated iteratively rather than using an S-N curve based Palmegran-Miner summation. Wind spectra used in the method are developed from long term meteorological records at representative locations. Software has been prepared to enable quick assessment of the expected fatigue life of <b>lighting</b> <b>poles,</b> and associated gear openings and holding down bolts The method and software has been calibrated with reference to full scale laboratory fatigue proof testing of representative base stubs and natural wind response testing of a 12 m high <b>lighting</b> <b>pole...</b>|$|R

25|$|Swayze, {{who was an}} FAA {{licensed}} pilot with {{an instrument}} rating, made the news on June 1, 2000, while flying with his dogs in his twin-engine Cessna 414 N414PS, from Van Nuys, California to Las Vegas, New Mexico. His plane developed a pressurization problem, causing Swayze to make a precautionary landing on a dirt road in a housing complex in Prescott Valley, Arizona. The plane's right wing struck a <b>light</b> <b>pole,</b> but Swayze was unharmed. He locked the cockpit, left the aircraft in the subdivision, and obtained a ride—with his dogs—from a passing vehicle driven by Gary Bruso, in order to telephone the authorities. According to the police report, witnesses said that Swayze appeared to be extremely intoxicated and asked for help to remove evidence—an open {{bottle of wine and}} a 30-pack of beer—from the crash site. He made himself unavailable to police for several hours. It was later determined that the alcohol in question was not in the cabin, but stored in external storage compartments inaccessible in flight and that the probable cause of the accident was Swayze's physical impairment due to the cumulative effects of carbon monoxide from engine exhaust by-products, carbon monoxide from heavy tobacco use, and the loss of an undetermined amount of cabin pressurization, resulting in hypoxia.|$|E

40|$|Identification {{of street}} <b>light</b> <b>poles</b> is very {{significant}} and crucial for intelligent transportation systems. Automatic detection and extraction of street <b>light</b> <b>poles</b> are a challenging task in road scenes. This is {{mainly because of}} complex road scenes.

500|$|Construction of both ships began {{well before}} the formal keel-laying ceremony; Evstafi on 13 July 1904 and Ioann Zlatoust on 13 July 1903, {{although}} the working drawings and preliminary calculations were not approved until 31 May 1904, which caused some problems with Ioann Zlatoust. Progress was relatively quick, despite the disruptions caused by the 1905 Revolution, and both ships were launched {{less than three years}} after work began. Fitting-out, however, was considerably delayed by a number of changes made as the navy digested the lessons of the Russo-Japanese War. Maximum elevation of the main guns was increased from 15 degree to 35 degrees, the number of torpedo tubes was reduced from five to two, mine stowage was eliminated as were the [...] guns. The armour protection of the waterline fore and aft of the main belt was increased to prevent the sort of damage that disabled several ships at the Battle of Tsushima. A second conning tower was added {{at the rear of the}} superstructure and its design was altered, probably to eliminate the overhanging top that deflected splinters into the conning tower at the Battle of the Yellow Sea and Tsushima.

500|$|Piemonte {{was built}} by the British {{shipyard}} Armstrong Whitworth in Elswick. Her keel was laid down in 1887 and she was launched on 23 August 1888. After completing fitting-out work, the new cruiser was completed on 8 September 1889 and delivered to the Regia Marina. In 1890, Piemonte participated in the annual fleet maneuvers in the First Squadron, along with the ironclad , Dogali, and several torpedo boats. The exercises were conducted in the Tyrrhenian Sea, where the First Squadron was tasked with defending against an attacking [...] "hostile" [...] squadron. By 1891, the Italian Navy had determined that Piemontes armament was too heavy, and so the four broadside 6-inch guns were replaced with lighter 4.7-inch guns and their sponsons removed. In addition, the heavy military masts were replaced by <b>light</b> <b>pole</b> masts. In the following years, the ship served in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean {{in addition to the}} Mediterranean. In mid-1896, violence against Italians in Brazil prompted the Italian government to dispatch Piemonte on a mission to secure the interests of Italian nationals in the country. The attempt at gunboat diplomacy secured an official apology from the Brazilian government, as well as an arrangement to adjudicate Italian claims of damages by the United States' and German ambassadors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{algorithm}} for extracting street <b>light</b> <b>poles</b> from vehicleborne mobile {{light detection and ranging}} (LiDAR) point-clouds. First, the algorithm rapidly detects curb-lines and segments a point-cloud into road and nonroad surface points based on trajectory data {{recorded by the}} integrated position and orientation system onboard the vehicle. Second, the algorithm accurately extracts street <b>light</b> <b>poles</b> from the segmented nonroad surface points using a novel pairwise 3 -D shape context. The proposed algorithm is tested on a set of point-clouds acquired by a RIEGL VMX- 450 mobile LiDAR system. The results show that road surfaces are correctly segmented, and street <b>light</b> <b>poles</b> are robustly extracted with a completeness exceeding 99 %, a correctness exceeding 97 %, and a quality exceeding 96 %, thereby demonstrating the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed algo-rithm to segment road surfaces and extract street <b>light</b> <b>poles</b> from huge volumes of mobile LiDAR point-clouds.
