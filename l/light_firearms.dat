50|$|Upon selection, VA Police Officers {{go through}} an eight-week basic {{training}} course (academy) at the VA Law Enforcement Training Center (LETC) located on Fort Logan H. Roots in Little Rock, Arkansas alongside the Eugene J. Towbin Veterans Medical Center. Additionally, VA Police Officers receive continuous in-service and specialized training (Written, Practical, and Scenario based) to include intermediate weapons, tactical and low <b>light</b> <b>firearms,</b> contact and arrest procedures on a regular basis. Officers may also partake {{in a series of}} advanced training courses offered by VA LETC on a selective basis to include crime scene investigations, traffic accident investigations, and technical surveillance. VA Police Officers are certified in CPR (as first responders), the use of Oleoresin Capsicum Pepper spray, the MEB Manadnock Expandable Police Baton, and the Beretta 92D 9mm sidearm. However, the agency {{is in the process of}} completing the transition to the SIG Sauer P229 DAK Version (Uniformed Officers) and SIG Sauer P239 DAK Version (Plain clothed Officials/Investigators) chambered in 9×19mm. Measures of additional standards and training were undertaken and implemented by the whole VA LETC academy in order to successfully achieve FLETA accreditation, which was officially granted on November 17, 2011. This accreditation placed the academy (and selected courses) on par with other well known federal law enforcement training centers and programs such as Drug Enforcement Administration Office of Training, Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), and the U.S. Secret Service James J. Rowley Training Center. The Department of Veterans Affairs Law Enforcement Training Center (LETC) often serves as a training program that is capable of meeting the training requirements for DoD Officers and their respective installations. The Department of the Air Force routinely sends their civilian Police Officers to the VA LETC in an effort to meet or exceed their requirements for base security and law and order operations.|$|E

50|$|In the 15th to 17th centuries the {{military}} and political significance of the castle grew to its peak. At that time Pernštejn {{was not only a}} centre of a large barony, but also a fortress, which {{played an important role in}} the struggle for Moravia and the city of Brno. This role of the castle responds for the first leg of its construction - John I carried out the largest reconstruction of the castle, which was also supposed to repair the damage after a big fire from the time before 1460. To the original heart of the castle was then complemented mainly by an ingenious fortification system that protected the whole naze. Ditches were dug around the castle and walls with new towers were built in the angles of the ramparts and inside the castle complex. The typical Pernštejn square tower grew outside the castle premises and was connected with them by means of two wooden bridges, which was to allow the last resort for defence and withdrawal in the case of seizure of the castle's core. The castle premises spread by new buildings to the prejudice of the inner yard, and the castle that lacked room began to grow upward. The main fortification system grew toward the north, the only possible direction where an attack could come from. The whole naze was built in this direction as a part of the fortress; it was surrounded by walls and diked by several moats with drawbridges. On the northern end there stood a tall semicircle renaissance bastion protecting the entrance to the spacious settlement around the castle with outbuildings. Another barrier on the way toward the castle was a mighty barbican whose 3 m thick walls with cernels for <b>light</b> <b>firearms</b> and a machicolation protected a narrow way to the entrance surrounded by ramparts. Even if the enemy got across another moat in the very area of the castle, they even would have to face the problem of conquering the only narrow entrance high above the ground to which a wooden ramp terminated by a drawbridge originally led. And then they would have to enter the rooms of the castle through a labyrinth of narrow passages and stairways where two men-at-arms could not pass side by side. The barbican belongs to the best-preserved examples of the late Gothic fortification element in the Czech lands.|$|E
5000|$|The Colt-Burgess rifle {{is similar}} in design to Winchester's lever-action rifles, such as the Winchester Model 1873. It was {{produced}} in two versions chambered for the [...]44-40 Winchester cartridge: a rifle version with a 25+1/2 in barrel, and a carbine with a 20 in barrel. [...] The rifle features either a full octagon, half-octagon, or round barrel, with the full octagon barrels being the most numerously produced among rifle variants. [...] A tubular magazine is located under the barrel in similar fashion to other lever-action rifles with a capacity of 15 rounds in the rifle version or 12 rounds in the carbine version. The receiver on the Burgess rifle is smaller than the Winchester 1873's, providing for a <b>lighter</b> <b>firearm.</b> The rifle's action, though similar to the Winchester 1873's, {{is considered to be}} a stronger design. The action utilizes a toggle-joint system to lock the breechblock. The extension of the loading lever is the lower part of the toggle-joint; the upper part of the toggle-joint is linked to the breechblock. Located on the receiver is a sliding loading gate from which cartridges are fed into the magazine; the sliding gate design is in contrast to Winchester's tilting gate. Burgess rifles are finished with either a blued or browned barrel featuring walnut stock and case hardened receiver, hammer, and lever.|$|R

60|$|FATHER BROWN {{was walking}} home from Mass on a white weird morning when the mists were slowly lifting--one of those mornings when the very element of light appears as {{something}} mysterious and new. The scattered trees outlined themselves more and more out of the vapour, {{as if they were}} first drawn in grey chalk and then in charcoal. At yet more distant intervals appeared the houses upon the broken fringe of the suburb; their outlines became clearer and clearer until he recognized many in which he had chance acquaintances, and many more the names of whose owners he knew. But all the windows and doors were sealed; none of the people were of the sort that would be up at such a time, or still less on such an errand. But as he passed under the shadow of one handsome villa with verandas and wide ornate gardens, he heard a noise that made him almost involuntarily stop. It was the unmistakable noise of a pistol or carbine or some <b>light</b> <b>firearm</b> discharged; but it was not this that puzzled him most. The first full noise was immediately followed by a series of fainter noises--as he counted them, about six. He supposed it must be the echo; but the odd thing was that the echo was not in the least like the original sound. It was not like anything else that he could think of; the three things nearest to it seemed to be the noise made by siphons of soda-water, one of the many noises made by an animal, and the noise made by a person attempting to conceal laughter. None of which seemed to make much sense.|$|R
40|$|Italian mafias {{have always}} used armed {{violence}} and intimidation to solve disputes, hit their competitors, enhance reputation and acquire privileged positions both in {{legal and illegal}} markets where they operate. Thus, the professionalized use of firearms and explosives represents a characteristic feature of these groups. This chapter presents original research on patterns, rules, changes and variations {{in the use of}} firearms violence by traditional mafia-type groups across Italy during the past twenty years, focusing specifically on the four main organizations. Although quantitative data on firearms-related crimes remains weak, this chapter also sheds <b>light</b> on <b>firearms</b> acquisition, storage, and use by these groups, suggesting that the availability of large arsenals and sophisticated weaponry as well as the ability to rely on fire groups are crucial for maintaining mafias’ power...|$|R
5000|$|The direct {{impingement}} (DI) {{method of}} operation vents gas from partway down the barrel through a tube to the working parts of a rifle where they directly impinge on the bolt carrier. This results in a simpler, <b>lighter</b> mechanism. <b>Firearms</b> that use this system include the French MAS-40 from 1940, the Swedish Ljungman Ag m/42 from 1942, and the American M16 rifle family. One principal advantage is that the moving parts are placed in-line with the bore meaning that sight picture is not disturbed as much. This offers a particular advantage for fully automatic mechanisms. It has the disadvantage of the propellant gas (and the accompanying fouling) being blown directly into the action parts. [...] DI operation increases the amount of heat that is deposited in the receiver while firing, which can burn off and cover up lubricants. The bolt, extractor, ejector, pins, and springs are also heated by the same high-temperature gas. These combined factors reduce service life of these parts, reliability, and mean time between failures.|$|R
5|$|The English {{enjoyed a}} marked superiority over the Scots in cavalry, {{particularly}} with the resurgence of heavy cavalry with their use of demi-lancers. The feudal heavy cavalry had begun to disappear from Scottish armies after Bannockburn in 1314. It was limited by the shortage of suitable horses. James V imported great horses and mares from Denmark {{in an attempt to}} improve the quality of Scottish breading stock. In the mid-sixteenth century the Scots still lacked sufficient heavy cavalry. In their place they fielded relatively large numbers of light horse, often drawn from the Borders and usually wearing jacks of leather or mail, mounted on small horses and using <b>light</b> lances. As <b>firearms</b> became available they began to field relatively large numbers of mounted arquebusiers.|$|R
50|$|With {{increasing}} firepower and no sufficient protection, {{the role}} of cavalry on the battlefield was slowly reduced. <b>Light</b> cavalry with <b>firearms</b> could return fire, but the aim from a moving platform was {{not as good as}} for infantry. So most important for cavalry was the ability to quickly attack enemy cavalry or scattered infantry with lances and sabres. Speed reduced the time vulnerable to gunfire, but still closed formations became impossible to defeat. This tactic was a striking surprise of Mongolian light cavalry {{in the battle of the}} Kalka River. The alternative was to use them as dragoons, reaching their positions quickly, dismounting, and fighting like infantry, often with projectile weapons. Such a way of fighting had started in Europe at least in the 13th century with mounted longbow and crossbow archers, but was also employed by the Mongols with their Buryatian longbows.|$|R
