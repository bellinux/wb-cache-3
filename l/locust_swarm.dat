500|$|Following this transformation, under {{suitable}} conditions dense nomadic {{bands of}} flightless nymphs known as [...] "hoppers" [...] can occur, producing pheromones which attract the insects to each other.

25|$|Farmers often try {{mechanical}} {{means of}} killing locusts, such as digging trenches and burying hopper bands, {{but this is}} very labor-intensive and is difficult to undertake when large infestations are scattered over a wide area.

This tends to shift the problem to neighbouring farms, and <b>locust</b> <b>swarms</b> can easily return to reinfest previously visited fields.|$|R
500|$|By {{the late}} Eastern Han period, the {{peasantry}} had become largely landless and served wealthy landowners. This cost the government significant tax revenue. Although {{the central government}} under Emperor He of Han (r. 88–105 AD) reduced taxes in times of natural disaster and distress without much effect upon the treasury, successive rulers became less {{able to cope with}} major crises. The government soon relied upon local administrations to conduct relief efforts. After the central government failed to provide local governments with provisions during both a <b>locust</b> <b>swarm</b> and the flooding of the Yellow River in 153 AD, many landless peasants became retainers of large landowners in exchange for aid. Patricia Ebrey writes that the Eastern Han was the [...] "transitional period" [...] between the Western Han—when small independent farmers were the vast majority—and the Three Kingdoms (220–265 AD) and later Sixteen Kingdoms (304–439 AD), when large family estates used unfree labor.|$|E

2500|$|The {{plague of}} locusts in [...] finds {{parallels}} in several ancient texts, often involving {{the actions of}} gods. [...] The ancient Sumerian tale The Disputation Between the Hoe and the Plow relates the acts of the god Enlil’s hand and the <b>locust</b> <b>swarm.</b> Similarly, an Ugaritic poem about the goddess Anat circa 1450–1200 BCE related how Anat did battle, leaving corpses like locusts. In a New Kingdom Egyptian letter, one scribe chided another for leaving scribal work to labor in agriculture, where “The mice abound in the field, the locust descends, the cattle devour.” An Akkadian prophecy foretold that locusts would arise and devour the land. The 754 BCE treaty between Ashur-nirari V of Assyria and Mati'ilu of Arpad, Syria, provided that if Mati'ilu violated the treaty, “May locusts appear and devour his land.” Similarly, the treaty between Ktk and Arpad struck at about 750 BCE provided: “If Matti’el is false to Barga’yah and to his son and to his offspring [...] [...] [...] May Hadad pour out everything evil on earth and in heaven, and every trouble. [...] And may he pour out hailstones upon Arpad. [...] Seven years shall the locust eat. [...] Seven years shall the worm eat. [...] Seven years shall blight come upon the face of its land, and no grass shall sprout, so that nothing green can be seen and its vegetation does not appear.” And the Vassal-Treaties of Esarhaddon, who ruled the Neo-Assyrian Empire 681–669 BCE, threatened the vassal who breached the treaty with these threats: “May Adad, the canal inspector of heaven and earth, {{put an end to}} vegetation in your land, may he avoid your meadows and hit your land with a severe destructive downpour, may locusts, which diminish the produce of the land, devour your crops, let there be no sound of the grinding stone or the oven in your houses, let barley rations to be ground disappear for you, so that they grind your bones, (the bones of) your sons and daughters instead of barley rations, and not even the (first) joint of your finger should be able to dip into the dough, may the [...] [...] [...] eat the dough from your troughs[...] [...] [...] May they (the gods) let lice, caterpillars, and other field pests eat up your land and your district as if locusts.” An Assyrian blessing wished: “The evil locust which ravages the grain, the malignant grasshopper which dries up the orchards, which would cut off the regular offerings of god and goddess, — Enlil listens to you, Tutu obeys you — may it (the grasshopper) be counted as nought!” ...|$|E
60|$|But such a people, {{the wise}} Balaam saw, {{would not be}} mere conquerors, like those savage hordes, or plundering armies, which have so often swept over the earth before and since, leaving no trace behind save blood and ashes. Israel would be not only a conqueror, but a colonist and a civilizer. And as the sage looked down on that well- ordered camp, {{he seems to have}} {{forgotten}} for a moment that every man therein was a stern and practised warrior. 'How goodly,' he cries, 'are thy tents, oh Jacob, and thy camp, oh Israel.' He likens them, not to the <b>locust</b> <b>swarm,</b> the sea flood, nor the forest fire, but to the most peaceful, and most fruitful sights in nature or in art. They are spread forth like the water-courses, which carry verdure and fertility as they flow. They are planted like the hanging gardens beside his own river Euphrates, with their aromatic shrubs and wide- spreading cedars. Their God-given mission may be stern, but it will be beneficent. They will be terrible in war; but they will be wealthy, prosperous, civilized and civilizing, in peace.|$|E
50|$|The {{outbreak}} inspired several {{works of}} literature.

50|$|Argentina is {{currently}} facing the largest <b>locust</b> <b>swarm</b> {{within the past}} 60 years. According to Diego Quiroga, Argentina's agriculture agency’s chief of vegetative protection, {{said that it is}} impossible to eradicate the swarm, so they are focusing on minimizing the damage caused by it by sending out fumigators equipped with backpack sprayers to exterminate small pockets of young locusts that are still unable to fly. This method of extermination, however, is unable to wipe out pocket of locusts hidden in Argentina's large, dry forests. The swarm covers an area the size of Delaware in Northern Argentina. The locusts are expected to grow ten inches and mature into flying swarms by February fifth.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, {{building}} on {{recent advances in}} acoustic imaging, a group of MIT researchers observed for [...] "the first time the formation and subsequent migration of a huge shoal of fish."

50|$|Young desert locusts are solitary and {{wingless}} nymphs. If food {{is short}} they can gather together and start occupying neighbouring areas, recruiting more locusts.

This can be the prelude {{to the development of}} the vast flying adult <b>locust</b> <b>swarms</b> which devastate vegetation on a continental scale.|$|R
50|$|When {{food and}} climatic {{conditions}} are favourable, huge <b>swarms</b> of <b>locusts</b> may develop. The first recorded swarm was in 1844, with further outbreaks from the 1870s onward. After 1900, {{the intensity and}} frequency of <b>locust</b> <b>swarms</b> increased, and since the 1920s, a pattern has developed of localised, high-density populations in some locations most years and less frequent major plagues over large areas persisting for one to two years.|$|R
5000|$|During this time, Col.

Between 1919 and 1941, he had been able to have 630 different veterans' bills passed through Congress that benefited ex-servicemen by more than 13 billion dollars. [...] In 1932, when President Herbert Hoover described “a <b>locust</b> <b>swarm</b> of lobbyists” that haunted the halls of Congress, Time magazine named Taylor as one of the agents who was paid $10,000 per year for their actions.

50|$|The Acrididae are the {{predominant}} family of grasshoppers, comprising some 10,000 of the 11,000 {{species of the}} entire suborder Caelifera. The Acrididae are best known because all <b>locusts</b> (<b>swarming</b> grasshoppers) are of the Acrididae. The subfamily Oedipodinae is sometimes classified as a distinct family Oedipodidae in the superfamily Acridoidea. Acrididae grasshoppers are characterized by relatively short and stout antennae, and tympana {{on the side of}} the first abdominal segment.|$|R
50|$|When {{breeding}} the scissor-tailed kite feeds {{mainly on}} skinks and other lizards, {{as well as}} small snakes, rodents and arthropods. Usually hunts on the wing, dropping onto prey but does catch prey in flight, especially insects flushed by grass fires. When termites emerge or <b>locust</b> <b>swarms</b> there may be gatherings of scissor-tailed kites.

25|$|<b>Locust</b> <b>swarms</b> {{fly with}} the wind at roughly {{the speed of the}} wind. They can cover from 100 to 200 {{kilometers}} in a day, and will fly up to about 2,000 meters above sea level (thereafter, it becomes too cold). Therefore, swarms cannot cross tall mountain ranges such as the Atlas, the Hindu Kush or the Himalayas. They will not venture into the rain forests of Africa nor into central Europe. However, <b>locust</b> adults and <b>swarms</b> regularly cross the Red Sea between Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, and are even reported to have crossed the Atlantic Ocean from Africa to the Caribbean in ten days during the 1987-89 plague. A single swarm can cover up to 1200 square kilometers and can contain between 40 and 80 million locusts per square kilometer (a total of around 50 to 100 billion <b>locusts</b> per <b>swarm,</b> representing 100,000 to 200,000 tons, considering an average mass of 2 grams per cricket). The locust can live between three and six months, and there is a ten to 16-fold increase in locust numbers {{from one generation to the}} next.|$|R
