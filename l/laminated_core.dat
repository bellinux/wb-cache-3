50|$|One {{common design}} of <b>laminated</b> <b>core</b> {{is made from}} {{interleaved}} stacks of E-shaped steel sheets capped with I-shaped pieces, leading to its name of 'E-I transformer'. Such a design tends to exhibit more losses, but is very economical to manufacture. The cut-core or C-core type is made by winding a steel strip around a rectangular form and then bonding the layers together. It is then cut in two, forming two C shapes, and the core assembled by binding the two C halves together with a steel strap. They have the advantage that the flux is always oriented parallel to the metal grains, reducing reluctance.|$|E

50|$|Often {{referred}} to as a bearing heater, the mains frequency unit employs standard transformer principles for its operation. An internal winding is wound around a <b>laminated</b> <b>core</b> similar to a standard mains transformer. The core is then passed through the work-piece and when the primary coil is energised, a magnetic flux is created around the core. The work-piece acts as a short circuit secondary of the transformer created, and due to the laws of induction, a current flows in the work-piece and heat is generated. The core is normally hinged or clamped in some way to allow loading or unloading, which is usually a manual operation. To cover variations in part diameter, the majority of units will have spare cores available which help to optimise performance. Once the part is heated to the correct temperature, assembly can take place either by hand or in the relevant jig or machine press.|$|E

40|$|Usually, {{electrical}} machines have a metallic cylinder {{made up of}} a compacted stack of thin metal plates (referred as <b>laminated</b> <b>core)</b> assembled with an interference fit on the shaft. The laminated structure is required to improve the electrical performance of the machine and, besides adding inertia, also enhances the stiffness of the system.

The following finite element beam models are analyzed: (i) an “equivalent diameter model”, (ii) an “unbranched model” and (iii) a “branched model”. To validate the numerical models, experiments are performed with nine different electrical rotors so that the first non-rotating natural frequencies and corresponding vibration modes in a free-free support condition are obtained experimentally. The models are evaluated by comparing the natural frequencies and corresponding vibration mode shapes obtained experimentally with those obtained numerically. Finally, a critical discussion of the behavior of the beam models studied is presented.
