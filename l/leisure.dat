5|$|On {{the other}} hand, type of <b>leisure</b> {{activity}} is substantially {{influenced by the}} individual's immediate situation—whether he has a family, whether there are recreational facilities nearby, and age. Early family influences, particularly involving the more social <b>leisure</b> activities, can be profound. The type of <b>leisure</b> activity also depends on the individual's current place in the life cycle.|$|E
5|$|Over time, {{emphasis}} {{in studies of}} <b>leisure</b> has shifted from the work-leisure relation, particularly in well-researched majorities, to study of minorities and the relation between <b>leisure</b> and culture. Marshall Gordon noted {{that there are two}} approaches in the study of leisure: formal and historical-theoretical. The formal approach focuses on empirical questions, such as the shifting of <b>leisure</b> patterns over an individual's life cycle, the relation between <b>leisure</b> and work, and specific forms of <b>leisure</b> (such as the sociology of sport). The historical-theoretical approach studies the relation between <b>leisure</b> and social change, often from structural-functionalist and neo-Marxist perspectives. Sheila Scraton provided a different analysis, comparing North American and British studies. The British approaches focus on input from pluralism, critical Marxism, and feminism; the American approaches concentrate on the social-psychological tradition.|$|E

5|$|Sociology of <b>leisure</b> is {{the study}} of how humans {{organize}} their free time. <b>Leisure</b> includes a broad array of activities, such as sport, tourism, and the playing of games. The sociology of <b>leisure</b> is closely tied to the sociology of work, as each explores a different side of the work–leisure relationship. More recent studies in the field move away from the work–leisure relationship and focus on the relation between <b>leisure</b> and culture. This area of sociology began with Thorstein Veblen's Theory of the <b>Leisure</b> Class.|$|E

5|$|Specific {{findings}} in sociological studies of <b>leisure</b> are illustrated by John Robinson's late-1970s study of American <b>leisure.</b> Robinson found that Americans, on average, have {{four hours of}} <b>leisure</b> time each weekday, and more on weekends—six hours on Saturdays, almost eight on Sundays. Amount of <b>leisure</b> time diminishes with age, work, marriage, and children. However, the amount of free time does not significantly depend on an individual's wealth. People desire less free time if they are uncertain of their economic future, or if their job is their central interest. During {{the second half of}} the twentieth century, watching television became a major <b>leisure</b> activity, causing a substantial decrease in the time dedicated to other activities; in the early 1970s the average American had 4 hours of <b>leisure</b> per day, and spent 1.5 of them watching television. Shared <b>leisure</b> activities increase marital satisfaction.|$|E

The club itself is 100% owned by Burnden <b>Leisure,</b> with Sports Shield Consortium leader holding 94.5% of issued shares in Burnden <b>Leisure</b> since the takeover from Eddie Davies in 2016. The remaining stakes are held by over 6,000 small shareholders with less than 0.1% holding each.|$|E
5|$|Apart from a {{definition}} of <b>leisure,</b> there are other questions of theoretical concern to the sociologist of <b>leisure.</b> For example, quantifying the results is difficult, as time-budget studies have noted that a given amount of time (for example, an hour) may have different values, depending on when it occurs—within a day, a week, or a year. Finally, as with many other fields of inquiry in the social sciences, {{the study of the}} sociology of <b>leisure</b> is hampered by the lack of reliable data for comparative longitudinal studies, as there was little to no standardized data-gathering on <b>leisure</b> throughout most of human history. The lack of longitudinal studies has been remedied in the last few decades by recurring national surveys such as the General Household Survey in the United Kingdom (ongoing since 1971). In addition to surveys, an increasing number of studies have been focusing on qualitative methods of research (interviews).|$|E

5|$|As John Wilson {{and others}} have noted, it is {{difficult}} to define <b>leisure.</b> Its definitions are numerous and often mutually contradictory, for example as a discrete portion of one's time or as a quality of experience irrespective of time. Joffre Dumazedier distinguished four distinct definitions of <b>leisure,</b> which begin broadly and gradually narrow in scope. The first and broadest defines <b>leisure</b> as a style of behavior that may occur even at work, the second defines it as any non-work activity; the third further excludes family and household obligations; and, finally, the narrowest defines <b>leisure</b> as activities dedicated to self-fulfillment. Dumazedier's four definitions are not exhaustive. Incompatible definitions and measures are seen as a major factor accounting for occasionally contradictory research findings.|$|E
