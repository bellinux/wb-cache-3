500|$|Three major {{types of}} organic matter (macerals) in oil shale are telalginite, lamalginite, and bituminite. Telalginite is defined as {{structured}} organic matter composed of large colonial or thick-walled unicellular algae such as Botryococcus and Tasmanites. Lamalginite includes thin-walled colonial or unicellular algae that occur as distinct laminae, but display few or no recognizable biologic structures. Under the microscope, telalginite and lamalginite are easily recognized by their bright shades of yellow under ultraviolet/blue fluorescent light. Bituminite is largely amorphous, lacks recognizable biologic structures, and displays relatively <b>low</b> <b>fluorescence</b> under the microscope. Other organic constituents include vitrinite and inertinite, which are macerals derived from the humic matter of land plants. These macerals are usually found in relatively small amounts in most oil shales.|$|E

The difference in fluorescence was however less pronounced between the control strains than between the gpd 1 Δ gpd 2 Δ strains, which can be explained by the limited redox imbalance in the control strains.|$|R

This effect might be elicited by shielding effects of the unlabelled silica shell.

Upon binding to DNA, probably by intercalation between the bases, it assumes a more rigid shape and becomes intensely fluorescent.

5000|$|In a {{modification}} of system B not two but three chemical inputs are simultaneously processed in an AND logic gate [...] An enhanced fluorescence signal is observed only {{in the presence of}} excess protons, zinc and sodium ions through interactions with their respective amine, phenyldiaminocarboxylate and crown ether receptors. The processing mode operates similarly as discussed above - fluorescence is observed due to the prevention of competing photoinduced electron transfer reactions from the receptors to the excited anthracene fluorophore. The absence of one, two or all three ion inputs results in a <b>low</b> <b>fluorescence</b> output. Each receptor is selective for its specific ion as an increase in the concentration of the other ions does not yield a high fluorescence. The specific concentration threshold of each input must be reached to achieve a fluorescent output in accordance with combinatorial AND logic.

50|$|Fluorescence {{spectroscopy}} is {{a highly}} sensitive method for studying the folding state of proteins. Three amino acids, phenylalanine (Phe), tyrosine (Tyr) and tryptophan (Trp), have intrinsic fluorescence properties, but only Tyr and Trp are used experimentally because their quantum yields are high enough to give good fluorescence signals. Both Trp and Tyr are excited by a wavelength of 280 nm, whereas only Trp is excited by a wavelength of 295 nm. Because of their aromatic character, Trp and Tyr residues are often found fully or partially buried in the hydrophobic core of proteins, at the interface between two protein domains, or at the interface between subunits of oligomeric proteins. In this apolar environment, they have high quantum yields and therefore high fluorescence intensities. Upon disruption of the protein’s tertiary or quaternary structure, these side chains become more exposed to the hydrophilic environment of the solvent, and their quantum yields decrease, leading to <b>low</b> <b>fluorescence</b> intensities. For Trp residues, the wavelength of their maximal fluorescence emission also depend on their environment.|$|E
5000|$|Core-shell {{semiconducting}} nanocrystals (CSSNCs) are a {{class of}} materials which have properties intermediate between those of small, individual molecules and those of bulk, crystalline semiconductors. They are unique because of their easily modular properties, which {{are a result of}} their size. These nanocrystals are composed of a quantum dot semiconducting core material and a shell of a distinct semiconducting material. The core and the shell are typically composed of type II-VI, IV-VI, and III-V semiconductors, with configurations such as CdS/ZnS, CdSe/ZnS, CdSe/CdS, and InAs/CdSe (typical notation is: core/shell) Organically passivated quantum dots have <b>low</b> <b>fluorescence</b> quantum yield due to surface related trap states. CSSNCs address this problem because the shell increases quantum yield by passivating the surface trap states. [...] In addition, the shell provides protection against environmental changes, photo-oxidative degradation, and provides another route for modularity. Precise control of the size, shape, and composition of both the core and the shell enable the emission wavelength to be tuned over a wider range of wavelengths than with either individual semiconductor. These materials have found applications in biological systems and optics.|$|E

Methods: Ten cylindrical specimens were prepared from bis-acrylic composites (PreVISION CB and Protemp 3 Garant), a light-polymerized composite (Revotek LC), and a polymethyl methacrylate-based (Dentalon) provisional fixed prosthodontic materials. Surface roughness was assessed by profilometry. The bacterial adhesion test was applied using Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) and spectro-fluorometric method. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and Dunnett t-tests. Results: All tested materials were significantly rougher than glass (P < 0. 05). Revotek LC had the greatest fluorescence intensity, PreVISION and Protemp 3 Garant had moderate values and all of them had significantly more bacterial adhesion compared to glass (P < 0. 05).
