30|$|One more {{evidence}} of the exciplex nature of <b>long-wave</b> <b>bands</b> in the EL spectra of zinc-chelate complexes with sulphanilamino-substituted ligands comes from their PL spectra in blends with hole-transporting materials. It was shown previously that the PL spectra taken from the layered structure exhibiting the exciplex EL OLEDs do not contain <b>long-wave</b> <b>bands</b> but only the intrinsic bands of components [21]. This {{is due to the}} extremely small thickness of the contacting interface of the two layers, which is responsible for EL. To observe the <b>long-wave</b> <b>bands</b> in PL, we prepared films containing blends of zinc complex and hole-transporting material. The films were prepared by casting from toluene solutions containing both components in appropriate concentrations. In such films, contacts between the two kinds of molecules take place in the whole volume of the film, unlike the bilayer OLED structure with very thin contact interface. The exciplex PL spectra of similar type mixed films were demonstrated previously [7].|$|R

The effect of SiO 2 addition on thermal stability, optical properties and structural characteristic on Bi 2 O 3 -B 2 O 3 glass were systematically investigated by using XRD, DTA, ultraviolet-visible transmittance spectra, midinfrared transmittance spectra and Raman spectra. The experimental results demonstrate that, {{with the addition of}} SiO 2, thermal stability of glass samples has been obviously improved.

40|$|Data {{compression}} {{on future}} space-based imaging interferometers {{can be used}} to reduce high telemetry costs, provided the performance is acceptable. This paper investigates lossy data compression of imaging interferometer datacubes using a wavelet transform-based compression algorithm, the Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees (SPIHT) image compression algorithm. Compression is performed on individual frames of the interferogram datacubes. Simulated datacubes from the Geosynchronous Imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer (GIFTS) are modified to produce new complex GIFTS datacubes used to perform the experiments. Separate programs are written for the encoder and decoder in C++. The encoder and decoder are simulated to the bit-level, meaning they simulate the exact bit streams that would be generated by hardware implementations. All compression ratios reported are based on the actual file size of the encoded data. The simulations indicate very high performance of the algorithm in the interferogram domain, with average errors of less than one least significant bit (LSB) for the GIFTS <b>long-wave</b> <b>band</b> and just over one LSB for the GIFTS short/mid-wave band at compression ratios as high as 13. 7 : 1 and 15. 4 : 1, respectively.

40|$|Using the ISCCP–FD surface {{radiative}} flux {{data for}} the summer season (June to September) of the period 1992 to 1995, an analysis was done to understand the role of clouds on the surface radiation budget over the Asian monsoon region. At the top of atmosphere (TOA) of convective regions of the Asian monsoon region, the short wave radiative forcing (SWCRF) and long wave radiative forcing (LWCRF) do not cancel each other resulting in occurrence of the net cloud radiative forcing values exceeding − 30 W/m 2. This type of imbalance between SWCRF and LWCRF at TOA is reflected down on the earth surface–atmosphere system also as an imbalance between surface netcloud radiative forcing (NETCRF) and atmospheric NETCRF. Based on the regression analysis of the cloud effects on the surface radiation budget quantities, {{it has been observed}} that generally, the variance explained by multiple type cloud data is 50 % more than that of total cloud cover alone. In case of SWCRF, the total cloud cover can explain about 3 % (7 %) of the variance whereas the three cloud type descriptions of clouds can explain about 44 % (42 %) of the variance over oceanic (land) regions. This highlights the importance of cloud type information in explaining the variations of surface radiation budget. It has been observed that the clouds produce more cooling effect in short-wave band than the warming effect in <b>long-wave</b> <b>band</b> resulting in a net cooling at the surface. Over the oceanic region, variations in high cloud amount contribute more to variations in SWCRF while over land regions both middle and high cloud variations make substantial contributions to the variations in both SWCRF and NETCRF. 1...|$|E

One of the methods for preventing exciplex emission is the insertion of an additional layer between the hole-transporting and electron-transporting materials [9, 10, 12, 13]. CBP is considered {{as one of the}} materials appropriate for such layers [10]. We have fabricated two control devices with CBP as the intermediate layer: ITO/PTA/NPD/CBP/Zn(PSA-BTZ) 2 /Al:Ca (device 3) and ITO/PTA/CBP/Zn(PSA-BTZ) 2 /Al:Ca (device 4). Figure 2 shows the EL spectra of devices 3 and 4 (Figure 2 a, curve 3 and Figure 2 b, curve 2, respectively). In both cases, the EL spectra contain no wide band around 560 nm and exhibit only one band in the blue region with the maximum at 471 nm (device 3) and 469 nm (device 4), which may be attributed mainly to the intrinsic emission of the Zn(PSA-BTZ) 2 complex.

Dependence of the VIIRS TEB (thermal emissive band) noise on the cold FPA temperature was measured using onboard calibrator data acquired during these occurrences.

40|$|Absolute {{fluorescence}} quantum yields {{are reported}} for the rhodamine 6 G cation and the fluorescein dianion dyes in nine solvents. This information is combined with pre-viously reported fluorescence lifetimes to deduce radia-tive and nonradiative decay rates. Along the alcohol se-ries from methanol to octanol, rhodamine 6 G displays an increasing radiative rate, in parallel with {{the square of the}} refractive index increase, and a slightly decreasing nonradiative rate. Fluorescein is different: the apparent radiative rate actually decreases, suggesting that the emissive species is perturbed in some fashion. For both dyes, fluorescence yields are enhanced in D 2 O, rising to 0. 98, in parallel with a corresponding increase in life-times. Protonated solvents invariably give shorter life-times and lower quantum yields, contrary to some pre-vious speculation.

40|$|Abstract. An {{optical sensor}} (optode) {{membrane}} for continuous monitoring of silver ion is presented. It {{is composed of}} plasticized poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), a silver-sensitive chromo-ionophore, and a lipophilic borate salt acting as an anionic site. The membrane selectively responds to silver ion in the concentration range from 50 pM to 10 raM, giving a reversible colour change from blue to pink, with response times {{of the order of}} 2 min. The acridinium dye acts as both the recognition element and the chromo-ionophore. Its <b>long-wave</b> absorption <b>band</b> is at around 680 nm, which makes it compatible with existing LED light sources and diode lasers. A lipophilic octadecyl side chain renders ithighly lipophilic and this prevents its leakage out of the PVC membrane. Hence, the operational lifetime exceeds 1 week, without any changes in the work function. Key words: silver sensor, optical sensors, chromo-ionophore, spectrophotometry, PVC membrane. Silver is widely used in conventional photography, the production of electrical conductors, and in electroplating. It has been estimated that the total annual loss of silver to the environment from industrial wastes exceeds 2500 metric tons [1], a fact that clearly points to the importance ofmonitoring and recycling of silver, both from a commercial nd an environmental point of view. Numerous analytical procedures (including single-shot tests and field tests) have been described for determination f silver. However, in order to enable continuous monitoring, sensors rather than discontinuous methods are required. Among them, solid-state sensors based on silver sulphide are predominant. In addition, elec-trochemical ion-selective sensors (ISEs and ISFETs) based on plasticized PVC membranes, modified with various silver-selective ionophores uch as thia-crown ethers [2 - 7], calixarenes [8, 9], and pyridinophanes [10] have been reported.

TIRS geometric calibration thus {{relied heavily on}} on-orbit measurements.
