5|$|The Democrats {{held their}} {{convention}} {{the next month}} in New York City. The convention soon deadlocked, and after 103 ballots, the delegates finally agreed on a compromise candidate, John W. Davis, with Charles W. Bryan nominated for vice president. The Democrats' hopes were buoyed when Robert M. La Follette Sr., a Republican senator from Wisconsin, split from the GOP {{to form a new}} Progressive Party. Many believed that the split in the Republican party, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> 1912, would allow a Democrat to win the presidency.|$|E
5|$|In a later review, McNulty praised scenes <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> which Sasuke admits {{his crimes}} and agrees {{to go to}} prison, as it showed {{acceptance}} of responsibility for his misdeeds. McNulty also praised Sasuke's later journey of self-redemption, {{as well as his}} decision to respond to Sakura's feelings for him before leaving. IGN's Ramsey Isler considered Sasuke's change of heart drastic, but felt it was a fitting conclusion for the character after the series' events, and fit well with him once again leaving the village, this time on good terms with his friends and the village. Manga author Hiroaki Samura was pleased with Sasuke's character arc in the series, especially his influence on Naruto and {{the fact that in the}} end he returns to Konohagakure because of Naruto. While finding Sasuke's fate in the manga's ending predictable, McNulty felt that the character's monologue after his final fight with Naruto helped to show a deeper side to him.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{building}} an operational reactor running at criticality in a populated area {{was a significant}} issue, as there was a danger of a catastrophic nuclear meltdown blanketing one of the United States' major urban areas in radioactive fission products. But the physics of the system suggested that the pile could be safely shut down even {{in the event of}} a runaway reaction. When a fuel atom undergoes fission, it releases neutrons that strike other fuel atoms in a chain reaction. The time between absorbing the neutron and undergoing fission is measured in nanoseconds. Szilard had noted that this reaction leaves behind fission products that may also release neutrons, but do so over much longer periods, from microseconds to as long as minutes. In a slow reaction <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> a pile where the fission products build up, these neutrons account for about three percent of the total neutron flux.|$|E

5|$|The Bhagavata Purana narrates {{further that}} the grief-stricken Rati goes mad by Kama's death {{and in the}} Matsya Purana and the Padma Purana versions, she smears herself with her husband's ashes. Further in Bhagavata Purana, Rati {{undergoes}} severe penance and pleads with Parvati to intercede with Shiva to restore her husband. Parvati reassures her that Kama would be reborn as Pradyumna, the son of Krishna, the Avatar of the god Vishnu on earth, and Rati should wait {{for him in the}} demon (asura) Sambara's house. In other versions of the narrative like the Matsya Purana, the Padma Purana, the Shiva Purana, the Linga Purana and the Kathasaritsagara, it is Shiva who blesses Rati with the boon of Kama's resurrection. In other variants, she curses the gods who sent Kama for this doomed mission and the gods, as a group or Brahma, seeks relief for the grieving Rati from Shiva or the Supreme Goddess, Parvati being one of her many manifestations. In some legends, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> the Brahmanda Purana, the Goddess revives Kama immediately, hearing the pleading of the wailing Rati and the gods. The renowned Sanskrit poet Kalidasa dedicates canto IV discussing the plight of Rati in his Kumarasambhava, which focuses on the story of the wedding of Shiva and Parvati and the birth of their son Skanda, who kills Tarakasura. Canto IV narrates that Rati witnesses the death of her husband and laments his death, and then tries to immolate herself on a funeral pyre. A heavenly voice stops her on time, stating that after the marriage of Shiva, he will revive her husband.|$|E
25|$|There was {{a growing}} concern that local unions were {{vulnerable}} {{to the power of}} Mine Owners' Associations <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> Coeur d'Alene. In May 1893, about forty delegates from northern hard rock mining camps met in Butte, and established the Western Federation of Miners, which sought to organize miners throughout the West.|$|E
25|$|The {{receiver}} {{is generally}} {{one of two}} types: a super-regenerative receiver or a superheterodyne. The super-regenerative receiver works like that of an intermittent oscillation detection circuit. The superheterodyne works <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> a radio receiver. The superheterodyne receiver is used because of its stability, high sensitivity and it has relatively good anti-interference ability, a small package and lower price.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} issue of Huxley's Natural History Review, an article by George Rolleston on the {{orangutan}} brain showed the features that Owen claimed apes lacked, and when Owen responded {{in a letter to}} the Annals and Magazine of Natural History that the issue was a matter of definition rather than fact, Huxley made a public dissection of a spider monkey that had died at the zoo, to support his case. In the following issue John Marshall provided detailed measurements making the same point about the chimpanzee, as well as explaining how a chimpanzee's brain could be distorted by not being properly preserved and removed from the skull, so that it would look <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> Owen's illustration.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{publishing}} {{articles in}} the Negro Worker and other newspapers, Wallace-Johnson also wrote poetry and essays. Many of his writings have been lost, but those that are available offer insight into his innermost thoughts. He typically portrayed the Soviet Union as a haven of freedom or capitalist systems <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> the United States as corrupt. His two most famous works, Das Sdrarstwuiet and The Declaration of Capitalism, were published multiple times in the Negro Worker and were widely received by the general public. In Das Sdrarstwuiet, Wallace-Johnson praised the freedoms given to citizens Soviet Union, while in The Declaration of Capitalism, he described the political oppression faced by those living in a capitalist society.|$|E

The president Toshimasa Asahara of the University said, he hoped that {{the university}} staff would also learn from the experience of the Red Cross in the care for disaster-disasters, including those in other countries. The University of Hiroshima University did establish a leading research center into the effects of radiation on the human body and health: the Research Institute for Radiation, Biology and Medicine, due to decades lasting studies after the effects on local population, that survived the atomic-explosion of Hiroshima in 1945.|$|E
25|$|The Northern Railroad was not {{finished}} until 1908, {{thanks in part}} to the concession of the line to United Fruit Company (UFCO), but by then the interoceanic railway was not the critical way it had been; by then, the United States had defeated Spain and after several discussions with Nicaragua and Colombia, had chosen Colombia to build and interoceanic canal and causing the separation of Panama from Colombia when the latter had tried to increase the concession conditions to build the canal. The American policity towards Central America in 1908 was focused on keeping the region as peaceful as possible, using for it American companies investments -e.g., United Fruit Company- and military interventions <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> Panamá in 1903 and the ousting of Nicaraguan president José Santos Zelaya in 1911; all aimed to keep a swift and smooth construction of the Panama Canal.|$|E

25|$|As the Browns {{beat the}} Bills, the 49ers beat the Yankees in San Francisco by {{a score of}} 17–7. That set up a {{championship}} game matchup between Cleveland and San Francisco in Cleveland. In {{the week before the}} game, AAFC and NFL owners agreed to terms under which the Browns, 49ers and Colts would play in the NFL starting in the 1950, while the AAFC's other clubs would go out of business. Owners of disbanded teams got minority stakes in NFL clubs, while a dispersement draft would allocate AAFC players to active teams in the newly organized league to be called the National American Football League. The owners had floated a similar proposal in 1948, but it had been vetoed by George Preston Marshall, the owner of the NFL's Washington Redskins, and Tim Mara, the owner of the New York Giants. Teams in both leagues were suffering financially, {{in part because of the}} competition between them for talent that was driving up player salaries and eating into owners' profits. Paul Brown criticized the deal the owners eventually agreed upon, preferring a unified two-league setup <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> Major League Baseball.|$|E
