The electro-optical coefficients rIJ are compared with the corresponding nlo coefficients dJI. It is shown that the <b>electro-optical</b> <b>effect</b> is mainly of electronic origin.

Through their SEM pictures, {{the relationship between}} the <b>linear</b> <b>electro-optical</b> <b>effect</b> and the mesh size of the polymer network was explored. With the increase of number of photo-polymerizable monomers, the mesh size of the polymer network would become larger. So the liquid crystal molecules would be easily oriented in the electric field and therefore, the threshold voltage and saturation voltage would decrease. The open state response times were also reduced and the off state response times would be extended.

40|$|Since the <b>linear</b> <b>electro-optical</b> or Pockels <b>effect</b> {{is one of}} {{the strongest}} and most useful effects in poled polymers, it can be {{employed}} for investigating the magnitude, the spatial distribution and the thermal and temporal stability of the dipole orientation. Some of the relevant ellipsometric and interferometric techniques are briefly described. Emphasis is given to frequency-dependent electro-optical measurements which permit a relaxation spectroscopy based on the probing of the dipole orientation by means of frequency scanning of the linear susceptibility (optical birefringence). Such a spectroscopy is of particular relevance for the recently introduced "orientational enhancement" in photorefractive polymers. In addition, scanning electro-optical microscopy and electro-optical phase-shift interferometry are described as useful methods for measuring spatial dipole-orientation patterns...|$|R
40|$|The orientational and {{translational}} {{order of}} a thermotropic ferroelectric liquid crystal (2 MBOCBC) imbibed in self-organized, parallel, cylindrical pores with radii of 10, 15, or 20 nm in anodic aluminium oxide monoliths (AAO) are explored by high-resolution linear and circular optical birefringence as well as neutron diffraction texture analysis. The results are compared to experiments on the bulk system. The native oxidic pore walls do not provide a stable smectogen wall anchoring. By contrast, a polymeric wall grafting enforcing planar molecular anchoring results in a thermal-history independent formation of smectic C* helices and a reversible chevron-like layer buckling. An enhancement of the optical rotatory power by up to one order of magnitude of the confined compared to the bulk liquid crystal is traced to the pretransitional formation of helical structures at the smectic-A*-to-smectic-C* transformation. A <b>linear</b> <b>electro-optical</b> birefringence <b>effect</b> evidences collective fluctuations in the molecular tilt vector direction along the confined helical superstructures, i. e. the Goldstone phason excitations typical of the para-to-ferroelectric transition.

40|$|Study of {{electric}} field in radiation detectors by Pockels effect (Master Thesis) by Michael Hakl Abstract Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) is a convenient candidate for room tem- perature detection of X-ray and gama radiation due to 1. 5 eV band- gap energy and high atomic mass. Since CdTe {{has the highest}} <b>linear</b> <b>electro-optical</b> coefficient among II-VI compounds, the detector rep- resents a Pockels cell. Transmittance of the crystal is modulated by the internal electric field. Processing of infrared camera photographs results in an electric field profile between biasing electrodes. The elec- tric field in semi-insulting CdTe is influenced with deep level traps causing charge polarization under the electrodes. Occupation of traps is dependent on metal-semiconductor interface. Relation of charge accumulation and band bending for gold and indium contacts was studied. Repolarization/depolarization induced by additional illumi- nation with sub/above bandgap excitation laser was observed and ex- ploited for determination of the deep level energy. Results obtained by the Pockels-effect method were supported with luminescence measure- ments. Correlation between the occurrence of deep levels and surface point defects was discovered.
