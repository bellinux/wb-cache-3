The second purpose was to explore {{correlations}} between kicking speed {{on the one hand and}} anthropometric features and explosive strength on the other. METHODS: Female soccer players (N. = 190) were tested divided in two groups: elite group (N. = 100) and non-elite group (N. = 90). Body mass, height, leg <b>length,</b> body composition, <b>counter</b> movement jump, drop jump and kicking speed with both legs were measured. RESULTS: After controlling for experience with multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA), body mass, body fat and muscle mass differed significantly by level. MANCOVA also revealed that all the anthropometrical variables differed by playing position. However, MANCOVA did not show significant differences by level of play, neither for explosive strength nor for kicking speed but revealed significant differences among playing positions. There were significant positive correlations between body mass, height, leg <b>length,</b> muscle mass, <b>counter</b> movement jump height, drop jump height and experience on the one hand and kicking speed with dominant and non-dominant leg on the other for the elite and non-elite players. CONCLUSIONS: Elite players differ from their non-elite counterparts in terms of anthropometrical features, while explosive strength and kicking speed are not sensitive enough to distinguish between levels. On the other hand, the findings indicate few positional variations, and only goalkeepers, tend to have a specific anthropometric and fitness profile.

30|$|The third {{category}} aims at relieving the last packet problem which often causes large latency in networks with dynamic short-lived or low-rate flows. For this purpose, the delay-based back-pressure scheduling in [14] assigns link weight based on packet delay instead of queue length differential. Ref. [13] proposes an adaptive redundancy technique for back-pressure routing, which generates copies of packets to artificially increase {{the length of}} a queue when the queue’s occupancy is low, which dramatically improves the delay performance of back-pressure under light load condition. The idea in [13] is somewhat similar to our work in this paper in terms of using artificially increasing the length of nodes’ queue lengths when calculating link weights. However, in [13], a packet’s duplicate copies in a queue need to be really transmitted. In contrast, the VBR algorithm in this paper only uses a virtual queue <b>length</b> (as a <b>counter)</b> for transmission scheduling decision-making and causes no extra packet to be transmitted.|$|R
40|$|We propose several {{synchronous}} counter {{designs that}} have high counting and sampling rates and low cost {{at the same}} time.

We then propose a novel technique called postponed readout to further reduce the counting/sampling period to the delay of a 2 -input AND gate plus the time for loading a flip-flop, while requiring similar cost. The resultant count-ing/sampling rate is competitive with the fastest previous de-signs and is achieved at a hardware cost that is lower by a factor of about 2. The price paid is that the count is read out 2 or 3 cycles later (depending on the <b>length</b> of the <b>counter),</b> instead of I cycle in previous synchronous counters. ...|$|R

The measurements were made using a negative ion time projection chamber (NITPC) at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). We report the first quantitative analysis of photoelectron track length distributions in a gas. The distribution of track lengths {{at a given}} energy is best fit by a lognormal distribution. A powerlaw distribution of the form, f(E) =a(E/Eo) n, is found to fit the relationship between mean track length and energy.

40|$|The {{transition}} to turbulence in plane Poiseuille flow (PPF) {{is connected with}} the presence of exact coherent structures. In contrast to other shear flows, PPF has a number of different coherent states that are relevant for the transition. We here discuss the different states, compare the critical Reynolds numbers and optimal wavelengths for their appearance, and explore the differences between flows operating at constant mass flux or at constant pressure drop. The Reynolds numbers quoted here are based on the mean flow velocity and refer to constant mass flux, the ones for constant pressure drop are always higher. The Tollmien-Schlichting waves bifurcate subcritically from the laminar profile at $Re= 5772 $ and reach down to $Re= 2609 $ (at a different optimal wave <b>length).</b> Their localized <b>counter</b> part bifurcates at the even lower value $Re= 2334 $. Three dimensional exact solutions appear at much lower Reynolds numbers. We describe one exact solutions that is spanwise localized and has a critical Reynolds number of $ 316 $. Comparison to plane Couette flow suggests that this is likely the lowest Reynolds number for exact coherent structures in PPF. Streamwise localized versions of this state require higher Reynolds numbers, with the lowest bifurcation occurring near $Re= 1018 $...|$|R
40|$|Emergency Vehicle {{plays an}} {{important}} role when there is emergency situation in the area. And it is necessary to reach destination as soon as possible to save lives. Preemption techniques for emergency vehicles in high volume traffic were examined and it was found out that there is no tool for signal controller for Emergency Vehicle preemption. So the goal was to design signal controller which helps Emergency Vehicle to get green light throughout its travel time. This thesis solves the problem of selecting appropriate preemption technique and designing algorithm for preemption of Emergency Vehicle in high traffic volumes. Tool was created using PTV VISSIM for optimized traffic signal controller. Results can be saved as a text file which can be imported to excel for measurements and plotting graph values. The tool was tested providing different road and environment conditions and results were collected. The average travel time of Emergency Vehicle in network is improved up to 2 seconds per signal using optimized traffic signals. In this thesis, Emergency vehicles can reach their final stop 8. 1 seconds early using this setup. As in emergency situations every second counts so 2 seconds per traffic light is a huge improvement and it means, a lot of time can be saved by implementing this method in normal traffic on roads. Furthermore results were collected for total travel time, queue <b>length</b> and queue <b>counter,</b> speed and acceleration of vehicles in network, delay and stop time of vehicles.

50|$|For the new store (as {{with the}} Glaspaleis) {{inspiration}} was sought throughout Europe, including {{visits to the}} US and Sweden (especially the redevelopment of the Stockholm city centre {{and its effect on}} shopping was a good example because it was better adapted to the European situation). The new store wasn't just much bigger, but featured an extended assortment, a selection one would expect of a modern warehouse store. Clothing, Schunck's mainstay, was still dominant on floors 1 (children), 2 (ladies) and 3 (gents) (with 47 fitting rooms). In the Glaspaleis, customers were welcome to {{have a cup of coffee}} at the penthouse (serviced by the family themselves), but now this was professionalised to a complete lunchroom for 180 people at the fourth floor. The other half of that floor featured toys and interior furnishings, also something that was already present at the Glaspaleis. Offices and the canteen were on the top floor. The new sections, however, were located at the two lowest floors. The ground floor featured merchandise like stationery (and many pocket books), perfume and suitcases and a patisserie with its own bakery (all self-service, except for the bonbons, which had to be weighed). The souterrain housed a 2600 m² supermarket, with 7000 items on sale and an assortment ranging from Russian caviar to 70 types of cheese. Extra efficiency was achieved at the seven checkout counters by using two trolleys (and no conveyor belt). A cashier would move the items from one trolley to the other and the customer could then take that to one of the 53 'packaging tables' (with assistance for those who desired it), thus reducing waiting time at the counter. The region is known for its high demand for quality meat. The butchery in the supermarket had a total <b>counter</b> <b>length</b> of 45 m, and a freezer with a capacity of 10.000 kg of meat. This and the other cooled storage rooms (e.g., for fruit and dairy products) were serviced by a monorail, suspended from the ceiling. This, combined with automated weighing and packaging machines (with a capacity of 10,000 packages of meat per day and shrink-wrap for fruit) meant that the food did not need to be touched by human hands, which had its advantages for hygiene. Nevertheless, there were constantly 7 butchers at work.|$|R
