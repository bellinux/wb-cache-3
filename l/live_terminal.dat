5000|$|As {{the name}} implies, the machine had three brushes {{in contact with}} the commutator. One was earthed to the frame of the vehicle and another was {{connected}} (through a reverse-current cut-out) to the <b>live</b> <b>terminal</b> of the vehicle's battery. The third was connected to the field winding of the dynamo. The other end of the field winding was connected to a switch which could be adjusted (by inserting or removing resistance) to give [...] "low" [...] or [...] "high" [...] charge. This switch was sometimes combined with the vehicle's light switch so that switching on the headlights simultaneously put the dynamo in high charge mode.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes a 3-way 2-circuit switch is {{incorporated}} {{together with a}} regular socket, {{to be used as}} the main lamp socket in a lamp with a night light. In this configuration, the switched lamp one <b>live</b> <b>terminal</b> for the night light socket is exposed externally on the base of the socket, to be wired to the remote candelabra socket. Hence, this type of socket has a Hot terminal, a Neutral terminal, and a switched Hot terminal. This creates a confusing situation in which a keyed 3-way socket (which has a 3-contact socket at the top of it) has only two terminal screws, while a night-light socket (which does not have a 3-contact socket at the top) has three terminal screws on the base.|$|E

50|$|Fuse Boxes {{normally}} use cartridge or rewirable fuses with {{no other}} protective device, and basic 4-ways boxes are very common. Some older boxes are made of brown-black bakelite, sometimes with a wooden base. Although their design is historic, these were standard equipment for new installs {{as recently as the}} 1980s, so they are very common. Fuseholders in these boxes may not provide protection from accidental contact with <b>live</b> <b>terminals.</b>|$|R

50|$|Holroyd's {{bullying}} and Azuma-zi's dynamo worship combine to convince Azuma-zi that his god disapproves of Holroyd and eventually that it desires Holroyd {{as a human}} sacrifice. Azuma-zi surprises Holroyd, trips him and throws him against the exposed <b>live</b> <b>terminals</b> {{on the end of}} the dynamo, where he is electrocuted. Investigation of Holroyd's death is extremely perfunctory; the police are not called, Holroyd is presumed to have committed suicide, and nobody thinks to suspect Azuma-zi of murder.|$|R

50|$|Wiring a 3-way lamp is {{a simple}} matter of {{connecting}} the 3-way switch's two switched live wires (frequently red for the low-wattage circuit and blue for the medium-wattage circuit) from the switch to the two <b>live</b> <b>terminals</b> on the 3-way socket. The lamp's power cord must be connected so that the wire from the wide blade on the power cord plug (neutral) connects to the neutral terminal on the socket, and the wire from the narrow blade on the plug (hot) connects to the black wire on the switch.|$|R

Nevertheless, impressed by the swift death inflicted on Holroyd by the dynamo, Azuma-zi decides to make the scientific manager a sacrifice as well. The scientific manager fights back, and manages to keep himself clear of the live parts until a third person happens to arrive on the scene, at which Azuma-zi panics, abandons the struggle and seizes the <b>live</b> <b>terminals</b> in his own hands.|$|R

50|$|Switches for {{lighting}} {{may be in}} hand-held devices, moving {{vehicles and}} buildings. Residential and commercial buildings usually have wall-mounted light switches to control lighting within a room. Mounting height, visibility, and other design factors vary from country to country. Switches are often recessed within a finished wall. Surface mounting is also fairly common though is seen more in commercial industrial and outbuilding settings than in houses. A light switch box (a pattress box) has a plastic, ceramic or metal cover to prevent accidental contact with <b>live</b> <b>terminals</b> of the switch. Wall plates are available in different styles and colours {{to blend in with}} the style of a room. They are though quite easy to mount.|$|R
50|$|In the UK, {{guidelines}} {{established by}} the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) provide recommendations for the construction and use of test lamps. Probes must be well-insulated, with minimal exposure of <b>live</b> <b>terminals,</b> with finger guards to prevent accidental contact, and must not expose live wires if the test lamp glass bulb is broken. To limit the energy delivered {{in case of a}} short-circuit, test lights must have a current-limiting fuse or current-limiting resistor and fuse. The HSE guidelines also recommend procedures to validate operation of the test light. When a known live circuit is not available, a separate proving unit that provides a known test voltage and sufficient power to illuminate the lamp is used to confirm operation of the lamp before and after testing a circuit.|$|R
5000|$|The {{details of}} layout and {{construction}} of electrical rooms will be controlled by local building code and electrical code regulations. Requirements for an electrical room relate to fire safety and electrical hazards. An electrical room is usually required to be secured from access by unauthorized persons; these rules are especially strict where equipment within the room has exposed <b>live</b> <b>terminals.</b> Regulations may require two separate means of exit from a room where the power rating of circuits exceeds some threshold, to allow for quick exit in an emergency. [...] Rooms containing oil-filled equipment {{may be required to}} have fire-resistant construction or active fire suppression equipment in the room and may be designated as an electrical vault. Since power distribution often requires large numbers of electrical cables, special measures for fire resistance of cables and cable trays may be also specified by regulations.|$|R

50|$|The Secdo {{platform}} {{is made up}} of 3 components that allow organizations to implement an intelligence-driven ‘preemptive’ incident response approach. The Secdo agents are deployed on all endpoints and servers and record all activity at the thread level, and store them on a centralized server.

The platform also provides response and remediation tools, such as IceBlock to suspend processes in memory, isolation a machine and a <b>live</b> remote <b>terminal.</b>|$|R
5000|$|It {{is often}} the case that {{electric}} hum at a venue is picked up via a ground loop. In this situation, an amplifier and a mixing desk are typically at some distance from one another. The chassis of each item is grounded via the mains earth pin, and is also connected along a different pathway via the conductor of a shielded cable. As these two pathways do not run alongside each other, an electrical circuit {{in the shape of a}} loop is formed. The same situation occurs between musical instrument amplifiers on stage and the mixing desk. To fix this, stage equipment often has a [...] "ground lift" [...] switch which breaks the loop. Another solution is to connect the source and destination through a 1:1 isolation transformer, called variously audio humbucker or iso coil. Another extremely dangerous option is to break contact with the ground wire by using an AC ground lift adapter or by breaking the earth pin off the power plug used at the mixing deck. Depending on the design and layout of the audio equipment, lethal voltages between the (now isolated) ground at the mixing desk and earth ground can then develop. Any contact between the AC line <b>live</b> <b>terminals</b> and the equipment chassis will energize all the cable shields and interconnected equipment.|$|R

40|$|Dysthanasia means {{slow and}} painful death without quality of life. This study aimed {{to know whether}} nurses {{identify}} dysthanasia {{as part of the}} final process of the <b>lives</b> of <b>terminal</b> patients hospitalized at an adult ICU. This is an exploratory-qualitative study. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with ten nurses with at least one year of experience in an ICU, and interpreted through content analysis. Results indicate that nurses understand and identify dysthanasia, do not agree with it and recognize elements of orthonasia as the adequate procedure for terminal patients. We conclude that nurses interpret dysthanasia as extending life with pain and suffering, while terminal patients are submitted to futile treatments that do not benefit them. They also identify dysthanasia using elements of orthonasia to explain it...|$|R

5000|$|The rear {{sound level}} in a live {{performance}} recorded in stereo is reproduced about 7 dB below the front level, but clearly audible. The rear ambient sounds, applause, and coughs from the audience are sometimes received out of phase by the stereo microphones, while sounds from the musicians mostly are in [...] "synchronous phase".Thus, if rear speakers are fed with {{the difference between the}} stereo channels, audience noises and reverberation from the auditorium may be heard from behind the listener. This can be most easily achieved by wiring two similar additional rear speakers in series between the <b>live</b> feeds (positive <b>terminals)</b> from the stereo amplifier. Alternatively, one rear speaker can be used on its own. This is the type of quad setup used by Seeburg jukeboxes that had quadraphonic sound.|$|R

40|$|Calcium plays many {{roles in}} the nervous system but none more {{impressive}} than as the trigger for neurotransmitter release, and none more profound than as the messenger essential for the synaptic plasticity that supports learning and memory. To further elucidate the molecular underpinnings of Ca 2 +-dependent synaptic mechanisms, a model system is required that is both genetically malleable and physiologically accessible. Drosophila melanogaster provides such a model. In this system, genetically-encoded fluorescent indicators are available to detect Ca 2 + changes in nerve terminals. However, these indicators have limited sensitivity to Ca 2 + and often show a non-linear response. Synthetic fluorescent indicators are better suited for measuring the rapid Ca 2 + changes associated with nerve activity. Here we demonstrate a technique for loading dextran-conjugated synthetic Ca 2 + indicators into <b>live</b> nerve <b>terminals</b> in Drosophila larvae. Particular {{emphasis is placed on}} those aspects of the protocol most critical to the technique's success, such as how to avoid static electricity discharges along the isolated nerves, maintaining the health of the preparation during extended loading periods, and ensuring axon survival by providing Ca 2 + to promote sealing of severed axon endings. Low affinity dextran-conjugated Ca 2 +-indicators, such as fluo- 4 and rhod, are available which show a high signal-to-noise ratio while minimally disrupting presynaptic Ca 2 + dynamics. Dextran-conjugation helps prevent Ca 2 + indicators being sequestered into organelles such as mitochondria. The loading technique can be applied equally to larvae, embryos and adults...|$|R
