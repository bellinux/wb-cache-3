2500|$|In an {{interview}} with 60 Minutes, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said [...] "I worked for a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> [...] And {{this is one of}} the most courageous calls, decisions that I think I've ever seen a president make. For all of the concerns that I've just been talking about. The uncertainty of the intelligence. The consequences of it going bad. The risk to the lives of the Americans involved. It was a very gutsy call." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I'm {{fortunate}} enough that I {{have a job}} that provides for me really well, I give a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> credit that fight at this level. I think they could be compensated much better based on the income that the UFC takes in. Fortunately, I can just walk away and I'm OK with it. By no means do I mean it disrespectfully toward any other fighters because I think they do a great job. But hopefully Zuffa and the UFC will start paying them a little better." [...] John Cholish ...|$|E
5000|$|Crane {{has said}} that he does not like to know with whom he will be paired, saying, [...] "I looked up to a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> who I'm now playing with. So, I didn't want {{to have to go to}} sleep {{thinking}} about it." [...] He is also considered one of the slowest players on the tour. On at least two occasions his extremely slow progress through a course has become a media issue, including one in which a fellow tour player Rory Sabbatini played out of turn.|$|E
5000|$|Actor John Turturro also {{commented on}} the ending within an {{interview}} with Channel 4: [...] "I liked it because {{the idea of the}} story was about a simple man thrust into this overwhelming, debilitating circumstance, and he never really finds out what happens... Nicholas doesn't have all the answers to what he's trying to do. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> times <b>these</b> <b>guys,</b> their biggest problem is solving the script, but Nicholas seems to be a filmmaker who likes to throw the script away." ...|$|R
6000|$|He often said, with a {{sound of}} pride: [...] "We don't care a darn for all these would-be social climbers. The wife and I lead a regular Bohemian life. We know a swell little bunch of live ones, {{and we have some}} pretty nifty parties, lemme tell you, with plenty poker and hard liquor. And one-two of the bunch have got their own cars--I tell you they make a whole lot more coin than a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> society-column <b>guys,</b> even if they don't throw on the agony; and we all pile in and go up to some road-house, and sing, and play the piano, and have a real time." ...|$|R
2500|$|When Sebastian {{decided to}} record {{an album of}} Memphis soul {{classics}} it was suggested by Universal Music Publishing that Steve Cropper should be contacted {{to see if he}} would like to be involved. Cropper was interested, and he arranged for the other two members of The Mgs Donald 'Duck' Dunn and Steve Potts to participate. He also called in Lester Snell, who is a mainstay Memphis organ/keyboard player who has worked with artists including Eddie Floyd, David Porter and Isaac Hayes. The Memphis Album was recorded live on analogue tape at Ardent Studios Memphis in August 2007. The recording engineer Curry Weber explained the reason for this on AllMemphisMusic, an online Memphis radio station, [...] "Going to tape is just such a richer and warmer tone when you hit it first of all. Not a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>guys</b> <b>these</b> days are talented enough to go to tape, cause it's so definitive and destructive. When you're on tape, it's on tape, and it's really hard to go in and fix a bunch of stuff like you can with computer these days." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{writers and}} the actors had to do much {{research}} to understand the impact of PTSD in the navy. According to Brad Beyer (who portrays Joe Westcott), [...] "The one thing that stood out in my head is a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> that come back, you don't necessarily know what's wrong with them. It can be really subtle. These guys are always reliving it. They can't decipher between memory and what's {{going on in the}} present. I did the best I could to bring a sort of heightened sense to the confusion." ...|$|E
5000|$|Tom Verducci, {{longtime}} Sports Illustrated baseball writer, reminisced about Carter {{following his}} death, [...] "I cannot conjure a single image of Gary Carter with {{anything but a}} smile on his face. I have no recollection of a gloomy Carter, not even as his knees began to announce a slow surrender ... Carter played every day with the joy {{as if it were the}} opening day of Little League." [...] "Gary actually took a lot of grief from his teammates for being a straight arrow. It wasn't the cool thing to do but on the same token, I think he actually served as a role model for a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> as they aged. He was the ballast of that team. They did have a lot of fun, there's no question about that, but they were also one of the fiercest, most competitive teams I've ever seen and obviously their comebacks from the '86 postseason defines that team. Carter was a huge part of that." ...|$|E
5000|$|Writer Matt Bondurant {{wrote the}} {{historical}} novel The Wettest County in the World (2008), {{based on the}} Prohibition-era bootlegging activities of his grandfather Jack Bondurant and his grand-uncles Forrest and Howard. Producers Douglas Wick and Lucy Fisher optioned the book in 2008 {{and sent it to}} director John Hillcoat. [...] Hillcoat later commented, [...] "Bootlegging sort of drew Bondurants into this crazy kind of world of corruption and lawlessness ironically, but then mostly they survived, they got through it all and actually went on to have businesses and children. And traditionally the gangster film teaches us that we've got to pay for our sins. Usually the gangster is shot down in a blaze of glory and doesn't get up again."Hillcoat and screenwriter Nick Cave, who had worked together on the Western film The Proposition (2005), were attracted to the story by the success of the Bondurants. Hillcoat also said, [...] "we also loved the idea that it sort of touched on the whole immortality that a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> start to feel when they do survive so many strange experiences." ...|$|E
5000|$|His best plays {{were short}} gains late. He started right on a third-and-3, looked to throw {{and then cut}} back left {{and headed toward the}} {{sideline}}. He eluded Wes Brown's grasp, then tiptoed down the sideline for a 4-yard gain. Instead of possibly being forced to punt, the Gators scored a touchdown to make it 23-6. [...] "Unbelievable," [...] Meyer said. [...] "Vintage Tebow. He had a hell of a day. ... He kind of took that game over on that drive. That {{was one of the best}} plays. I can't wait to see that on film. He was this far from out of bounds and got the first down." [...] On the next possession, Tebow used a nasty spin move to escape All-American safety Berry and Gerald Williams, then hit Dennis Rogan so hard the defender's helmet flew off. [...] "I don't think he's human," [...] Kiffin said. [...] "I really don't. There were times when I asked coaches in the booth on the headset, 'Is he ever going to wear down?' But he never does. Our defense worked hard and you just prayed to get it to third-and-4, because if it was third-and-3, he was going to put his head down and run over people." [...] Tebow and the Gators had their heads down afterward. Meyer even said he had to lighten the mood in the locker room. [...] "I think there's so much pressure on this team to perform perfectly, which is good," [...] Meyer said. [...] "I'd rather be on that end than on, 'Boy, great job. We lost by 10.' I don't want to do that. There's a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> pressure on <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> and I felt it in there." [...] Florida went on to go 13-1 and finish #3 in the final AP poll.|$|R
5000|$|Nathaniel Lay writes: [...] "Pains. is edgy, destructive, {{and somehow}} smooth despite its ripping {{instrumental}} work and cracking vocals. When {{all is said}} and done, the EP serves as a great label debut that will easily make listeners want to {{keep an eye out for}} Islander’s forthcoming LP." [...] Graham Finney reports [...] "At the moment, the four tracks dished up are enough to give fans a taster of what this band are about and, while it's not the most original piece of work you're ever likely to hear, if you're a fan of Rage Against the Machine, Deftones, or Bad Brains, then you'll get value for your money should you choose to shell out on this EP. For me though, while it's nice to hear Islander paying homage to their influences on Pains, it'll be nice to hear them experiment a bit more with their own ideas and really open up their wings for future releases." [...] Chelc Eaves stated [...] "Among these tracks lies a song featuring H.R. (Human Rights), lead singer of the hardcore punk band Bad Brains, and it’s a solid pairing. With the release of their new EP, Islander also made time to shoot a video for their song “New Colors,” which they shot, directed and edited in its entirety. These days, it’s refreshing to see a band come out with hard work and drive, go the distance to do everything for themselves and end up with a great formula and booming music." [...] Reggie Edwards writes [...] "If people do that to Islander, we may lose a band who has great potential, so listen up.Their debut EP, Pains., opens with “New Colors,” a track that’s reminiscent of P.O.D. meets Rage Against the Machine or Deftones with a little Norma Jean or The Chariot sprinkled in for fun.Take that and add the next track, “Lucky Rabbit,” which features H.R. of Bad Brains and you’ve got one extreme song that will blow your mind coming from a new band.With the final two tracks, “Glass” and “Big Shot,” you’ve got an EP that will make you wish it was a full-length. This band has all the makings of being one of the next big things and in a music world where touring is the new way to make your living, Islander has what it takes.Look for them to not go anywhere anytime soon. In fact, if you see them on some big tours in the near future (Warped Tour), don’t be surprised." [...] "The last song on this EP is [...] "Big Shot", which really is a vehicle to highlight the musical ability of this band. To quote Sonny Sandoval of P.O.D.: [...] "New school band with old school soul and passion". This is like opening a fresh cold soda on a really hot day, refreshing.I look forward to seeing a <b>lot</b> more <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> in the future." [...] states David Kemp.|$|R

5000|$|The race {{restarted}} with 20 laps to go. Johnson was {{no match}} for Kenseth on old tires who passed him with ease for the lead. However, Joey Logano was hot on his tail in the closing laps. Kenseth blocked Logano's advance going into turn 3 with six laps to go. Coming to five to go, Kenseth ran into lap traffic and it allowed Logano to close in and Kenseth went up the track to block him again. Rounding turn 1, Logano turned him and send him spinning. This brought out the seventh caution of the race with five to go. After the race, Logano said that the incident was [...] "good hard racing. He raced me hard, so I raced him hard back. The fact that we’re the only team that can relax now is going to pay big dividends going into Martinsville. To make a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> nervous going into Talladega is part of the strategy." [...] Kenseth spoke on the incident saying that it's difficult [...] "to drive a car with the rear tires off the ground. I was moving around the best I could, Joey (Logano) was a lot tighter, a lot faster on the short run, but we were so much better on the long run. I could still kind of get up to the top and get a run and get around him. We caught those two lapped cars, ‘Crazy’ (spotter) told me I was clear and I was, I {{pulled up in front of}} him and he just lifted my tires off the ground and he wrecked us." ...|$|E
