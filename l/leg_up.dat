25|$|The initial plan, before Mike Cameron was acquired, {{was to have}} Kapler {{replace the}} non-tendered Kevin Mench as a {{right-handed}} option to share time with Tony Gwynn, Jr., Gabe Gross, and Joe Dillon, in left field.

In the stacked pad stance {{the lower part}} of the net is protected very well, but the upper third is completely open. In a last-ditch effort to block an incoming high shot the goaltender can roll around his upper back, flailing his pads through the air and stacking them on the other side.

25|$|Laxalt {{retired from}} the Senate in 1987 and was {{replaced}} by the man he had defeated in 1974, Harry Reid, who would go on to become the Senate Majority Leader. Laxalt made a brief run for the Republican Presidential nomination during 1987. The campaign lasted only four months after Laxalt determined that the effort had fallen short of its fundraising goals. Political commentators at the time concluded that he had waited too long to enter the race, which meant that not only did his competitors have a <b>leg</b> <b>up</b> in organization, but many of the top political strategists and fundraisers had already signed on with other camps. He was eventually named a co-chairman of George H.W. Bush's successful presidential campaign. Eight years later, he served in a similar capacity in Bob Dole's failed presidential bid.|$|E
25|$|ABC {{cemented}} {{its reputation}} as a youth-oriented network in daytime {{with the addition of}} One Life to Live to its schedule, with {{much of the rest of}} its lineup consisting of soap operas like Dark Shadows, sitcom reruns, and game shows packaged by Chuck Barris. One Life to Live replaced the short-lived Baby Game, in a three-way shuffle with Dark Shadows and Dating Game. The network placed the new serial at 3:30 PM EST, against CBS's established hit Edge of Night and the popular NBC game You Don't Say. Despite the tough competition, the intense tone of the plot and strong characters allowed the show to get a <b>leg</b> <b>up</b> on You Don't Say, wearing that game down to the point of its cancellation in September 1969; NBC replaced the Tom Kennedy-hosted game in that time slot with three unsuccessful serials: Bright Promise, Return to Peyton Place, and How to Survive a Marriage.|$|E

Insomniac agreed, resulting in most of the Ratchet & Clank engine technology being developed in-house by Insomniac, but some very important renderers were those developed by Naughty Dog. Looking back on the agreement, Ted Price said that [...] "Naughty Dog's generosity gave us a huge <b>leg</b> <b>up</b> and allowed us to draw the enormous vistas in the game."

500|$|On November 11 (with UT {{holding an}} 8-1 record) Heisman voter Rodney Gilmore of ESPN.com had McCoy listed third of five Heisman candidates. Gilmore said, [...] "I love his numbers (78 percent {{completion}} percentage, 28 touchdowns, only 7 interceptions and 2,879 yards) and his gutsy second-half performance against Texas Tech. And I have not forgotten about his epic performance against Oklahoma {{just a few}} weeks ago. However, Harrell outplayed McCoy head-to-head in the showdown last week, so Harrell has a <b>leg</b> <b>up</b> on him for now, but McCoy is within striking distance." [...] That same day, the Rocky Mountain News poll listed Harrell first and McCoy second in their weekly poll of 10 Heisman voters. Harrell received 44 points and 7 first-place votes while McCoy had 34 points and 2 first-place votes.|$|E

Aguilera may have a better voice (and a Grammy to validate it), but Spears has that 'it' factor that worked for pinup queens of the past, such as Farrah Fawcett". Adam Graham of Central Michigan Life commented that [...] "although the show was only about 10 songs long and the authenticity of her voice was in question throughout, it was really truly hard to walk away feeling anything but completely gratified". Dave Tianen of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel believed that the show [...] "was energetic, good-humored, fast-paced and bright". During the tour, accusations of lip synching arose.

500|$|The musical {{performances}} and selection in the episode {{were met with}} mixed response from critics. The original track [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] received general acclaim from critics. Berk praised the performance, and gave it four stars. He opined, [...] "All four stars are for the lyrics [...] in which the lovable dorks sing about being the lovable dorks {{we fell in love}} with [...] ". In her review for the episode, Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone praised the song, and called it a [...] "true anthem" [...] that [...] "ends triumphantly". Raymond Flandez of The Wall Street Journal gave a positive review of the song: [...] "The song grew out of a collaborative brainstorming session that went beyond rhyming dictionaries or first attempts at ditties such as 'Trouty Mouth', 'Big Ass Heart', and 'Hell to the No'." [...] Jarrett Wieselman of the New York Post commended the show for the use of original songs, and wrote [...] "Glee entered uncharted territory last night [...] no, not Kurt's first kiss. I'm talking about New Directions dabbling in, and debuting, their very first original songs. It was as risky for the show as it was for the group since opting to perform wholly new creations would either give them a <b>leg</b> <b>up</b> on the competition or put them six feet under." [...] Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle praised the song, and deemed it [...] "fun and summery".|$|E
500|$|It {{was also}} {{performed}} on Gaga's The Monster Ball Tour. The piano version was played by Gaga while balancing {{on the piano}} stool and holding one <b>leg</b> <b>up</b> in the air. Rapper Kid Cudi joined her then to perform his song [...] "Make Her Say" [...] which contains a sample of [...] "Poker Face". The actual version was performed at the last segment of the show. Gaga wore a dress made of guns and during the performance she pumped {{her hands in the}} air. For the revamped Monster Ball shows in 2010-11, Gaga was dancing around the stage while whipping a chain. It was also performed at the 52nd Grammy Awards, where she opened the show with the song while standing on a pedestal. Midway through the performance, she was flung into the garbage chute of the Fame Factory set, before emerging seated at a piano, facing Elton John. In May 2011, Gaga performed the song during Radio 1's Big Weekend in Carlisle, Cumbria. The song was included on the set list of her 2012-3 Born This Way Ball Tour in which she sports a modified version of her infamous meat dress. Gaga and her dancers put themselves headfirst into enormous meat grinders during the performance. For her 2014 residency show, Lady Gaga Live at Roseland Ballroom she chose to perform the song in a piano-only rendition. In the same year, at the [...] tour, Gaga performed the song in a medley with [...] "Just Dance" [...] and [...] "Telephone" [...] while wearing knee-length white dress and heels, and a bob wig.|$|E

The colours in the wreath were also changed from blue and white to blue and gold.

[...] Meanwhile, Dennis Swanson, president of ABC Sports, noted {{in a statement that}} baseball had been a blue-chip franchise since 1976 for the network, which was disappointed to lose it.
