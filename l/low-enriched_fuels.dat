40|$|High-performance {{research}} reactors require {{fuel that}} operates at high specific power to high fission density, but at relatively low temperatures. Research reactor fuels {{are designed for}} efficient heat rejection, and are composed of assemblies of thin-plates clad in aluminum alloy. The development of <b>low-enriched</b> <b>fuels</b> to replace high-enriched fuels for these reactors requires a substantially increased uranium density in the fuel to offset the decrease in enrichment. Very few fuel phases have been identified that have the required combination of very-high uranium density and stable fuel behavior at high burnup. UMo alloys represent the best known tradeoff in these properties. Testing of aluminum matrix U-Mo aluminum matrix dispersion fuel revealed a pattern of breakaway swelling behavior at intermediate burnup, related {{to the formation of}} a molybdenum stabilized high aluminum intermetallic phase that forms during irradiation. In the case of monolithic fuel, this issue was addressed by eliminating, as much as possible, the interfacial area between U-Mo and aluminum. Based on scoping irradiation test data, a fuel plate system composed of solid U- 10 Mo fuel meat, a zirconium diffusion barrier, and Al 6061 cladding was selected for development. Developmental testing of this fuel system indicates that it meets core criteria for fuel qualification, including stable and predictable swelling behavior, mechanical integrity to high burnup, and geometric stability. In addition, the fuel exhibits robust behavior during power-cooling mismatch events under irradiation at high power...|$|E

40|$|The new {{spirit and}} urgency of {{converting}} the remaining research reactors from {{highly enriched uranium}} (HEU) to <b>low-enriched</b> <b>fuel,</b> combined with the prospects of new ultra-high-density fuels, provides the main impetus and defines the basic scientific objectives for this thesis. It is predictable that activities to convert existing research reactors will intensify in the near-term future, which in turn would simultaneously increase the need for corresponding neutronics calculations. Here, especially {{the analysis of the}} remaining high-flux reactors, which are most difficult to convert due to compact core geometries, may benefit from high-precision simulation tools to adequately set-up and study reactor parameters using complete three-dimensional core models. The scope of the present thesis is to support this process in providing a new computational tool for neutronics calculations (M 3 O), which is based on standard physics codes, while using the technical computing environment Mathematica as the primary user-interface. The use of such modern environments can be very convenient for a variety of reasons: their analytical capabilities allow for a broad range of calculations and data manipulation, while their interactive graphical user-interface facilitates intensive control of input parameters and interpretation of achieved results. At the same time, Monte Carlo methods play an increasing role in neutron transport and burnup analyses. In M 3 O, the Monte Carlo code MCNP is employed, which offers the potential for high-precision modeling and analysis. Both major components, Mathematica and MCNP, are also used in an optimization tool developed below and based on the linear programming technique to optimize reactor performance by variation of the fundamental core parameters. The potential (and limits) of monolithic fuels is largely unknown today. Even though the conversion {{of a large number of}} medium-flux reactors would be relatively straightforward, the performance of monolithic fuel with low-enrichment in high-flux reactors is less obvious. A second main objective of this thesis is therefore to study the neutronics performance of monolithic fuel for a specific type of high-flux reactors, namely the class of so-called single element reactors. These reactors can be considered to be the most difficult to convert to <b>low-enriched</b> <b>fuel</b> because they are characterized by very compact and inflexible core designs. Every existing reactor of this design still uses highly enriched uranium. In addition to a generic single element reactor, which is introduced for more fundamental purposes, the German research reactor FRM-II will be the primary test-case for the evaluation of monolithic fuel performance because it would be an obvious candidate to use this fuel in the future...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Since the 1970 's, global {{efforts have}} been going on to replace the high-enriched (> 90 % 235 U), low-density UAlx {{research}} reactor fuel with high-density, low enriched (< 20 % 235 U) replacements. This search is driven by the attempt to reduce the civil use of high-enriched material because of proliferation risks and terrorist threats. American initiatives, such as the Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) and the Reduced Enrichment for Research and Test Reactors (RERTR) program have triggered the development of reliable <b>low-enriched</b> <b>fuel</b> types for these reactors, which can replace the high enriched ones without loss of performance. Most success has presently been obtained with U 3 Si 2 dispersion fuel, which is currently used in many research reactors in the world. However, efforts to search for a replacement with even higher density, which will also allow the conversion of some high flux research reactors that currently cannot change to U 3 Si 2 (eg.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{traveling}} wave reactor (TWR) is a once-through reactor that uses in situ breeding to greatly {{reduce the need}} for enrichment and reprocessing. Breeding converts incoming subcritical reload fuel into new critical fuel, allowing a breed-burn wave to propagate. The concept works on the basis that breed-burn waves and the fuel move relative to one another. Thus either the fuel or the waves may move relative to the stationary observer. The most practical embodiments of the TWR involve moving the fuel while keeping the nuclear reactions in one place−sometimes referred to as the standing wave reactor (SWR). TWRs can operate with uranium reload fuels including totally depleted uranium, natural uranium, and <b>low-enriched</b> <b>fuel</b> (e. g., 5. 5 % 235 U and below), which ordinarily would not be critical in a fast spectrum. Spent light water reactor (LWR) fuel may also serve as TWR reload fuel. In each of these cases, very efficient fuel usage and significant reduction of waste volumes are achieved without the need for reprocessing. The ultimate advantages of the TWR are realized when the reload fuel is depleted uranium, where after the startup period, no enrichment facilities are needed to sustain the first reactor and a chain of successor reactors. TerraPower's conceptual and engineering design and associated technology development activities have been underway since late 2006, with over 50 institutions working in a highly coordinated effort to place the first unit in operation by 2026.
