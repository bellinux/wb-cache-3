40|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} {{to assume a}} Gaussian distribution of both the input acceleration and the response when modeling random vibration tests. In the <b>laboratory,</b> however, <b>shaker</b> controllers often limit the drive signal to prevent high amplitude peaks. The high amplitudes may either be truncated at a given level (socalled brick wall limiting or abrupt clipping), or compressed (soft limiting), resulting in drive signals which are no longer Gaussian. The paper first introduces several methods for limiting a drive signal, including brick wall limiting and compression. The limited signal is then passed through a linear time-invariant system representing a device under test. High cycle fatigue life predictions are subsequently made using spectral fatigue and rainflow cycle counting schemes. The life predictions are compared with those obtained from unclipped input signals. Some guidelines are provided to help the test engineer decide how clipping should be applied under different test scenarios...|$|R
40|$|An {{open-source}} 3 -D printable {{laboratory sample}} rotator mixer is developed here in two variants that allow users {{to opt for}} the level of functionality, cost saving and associated complexity needed in their laboratories. First, a laboratory sample rotator is designed and demonstrated {{that can be used}} for tumbling as well as gentle mixing of samples in a variety of tube sizes by mixing them horizontally, vertically, or any position in between. Changing the mixing angle is fast and convenient and requires no tools. This device is battery powered and can be easily transported to operate in various locations in a lab including desktops, benches, clean hoods, chemical hoods, cold rooms, glove boxes, incubators or biological hoods. Second, an on-board Arduino-based microcontroller is incorporated that adds the functionality of a <b>laboratory</b> sample <b>shaker.</b> These devices can be customized both mechanically and functionally as the user can simply select the operation mode on the switch or alter the code to perform custom experiments. The open source laboratory sample rotator mixer can be built by non-specialists for under US$ 30 and adding shaking functionality can be done for under $ 20 more. Thus, these open source devices are technically superior to the proprietary commercial equipment available on the market while saving over 90 % of the costs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{vibratory}} media {{finishing process}} {{is known for}} its long process time and there is an industrial need to speed up this process. Increasing frequency and amplitude of vibration, beyond the current process window commonly used, is an option to reduce process time. Using a <b>laboratory</b> scale electro-magnetic <b>shaker</b> setup, the effects of increasing frequency and amplitude of vibration is investigated. By monitoring the surface roughness with processing time it is shown that, while for a given amplitude frequency has a strong effect, amplitude in general has a stronger effect in quickening the time to saturation. Using high-speed camera measurements in a transparent bowl it is also shown that the average media speed increases with increase in frequency and this can partially explain the resulting shorter process time...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} loading density, length of transit time, {{temperature}} and salinity on milkfish (Chanos chanos Forsskal) eggs during simulated transport were examined. Rocking motion approximating conditions of transport of eggs collected from milkfish broodstock floating net cages to a hatchery was simulated using a <b>laboratory</b> orbit <b>shaker.</b> Loading densities {{of more than}} 7000 eggs/l in shipping bags resulted in decreased rates of survival and correspondingly lower hatching rates. Prolonged shaking simulating extended periods of egg transport also resulted in low egg survival and hatching rates compared to fertilized eggs not subjected to simulated transport. Egg survival after simulated transport at 20 Â°C was lower than at 28 Â°C, except at 20 ppt salinity, where survival was equal. Egg survival at 20 Â°C progressively increased with declining salinity levels whereas high egg survival rates were observed after 2 h of simulated egg transport at 28 Â°C and at the three salinities tested. Hatching rates of fertilized eggs after simulated transport were higher at 28 Â°C than at 20 Â°C regardless of salinity. Neither salinity nor its interaction with temperature affected hatching rates of eggs after simulated transport. These results indicate that survival and hatching of fertilized milkfish eggs after simulated transport is influenced by loading density, transport time, temperature and, to some degree, the salinity of the water. Based on these results, guidelines for handling and transporting milkfish eggs are given...|$|R
40|$|December 2003 *Shakers/Rockers/Rotators Vol. 3, No. 4 Mixing is an {{operation}} in the clinical laboratory that functions to create a uniform heterogeneous system or to promote the union of antigen and antibody. Proper mixing helps maintain the suspension of reagents that otherwise readily separate. Inadequate mixing can result in invalid test data or interpretation. Excessive mixing may cause denaturation of protein, hemolysis of red blood cells or foaming. There are many types of mixers in the <b>laboratory</b> including tube <b>shakers</b> or rockers, orbital mixers such as card and tube rotators, and vortexers.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the modeling of a PWR fuel assembly under dynamic shock loading {{in support of}} the Sandia National <b>Laboratories</b> (SNL) <b>shaker</b> test campaign. The focus of the test campaign is on evaluating the response of used fuel to shock and vibration loads that a can occur during highway transport. Modeling began in 2012 using an LS-DYNA fuel assembly model that was first created for modeling impact scenarios. SNL’s proposed test scenario was simulated through analysis and the calculated results helped guide the instrumentation and other aspects of the testing. During FY 2013, the fuel assembly model was refined to better represent the test surrogate. Analysis of the proposed loads suggested the frequency band needed to be lowered to attempt to excite the lower natural frequencies of the fuel assembly. Despite SNL’s expansion of lower frequency components in their five shock realizations, pretest predictions suggested a very mild dynamic response to the test loading. After testing was completed, one specific shock case was modeled, using recorded accelerometer data to excite the model. Direct comparison of predicted strain in the cladding was made to the recorded strain gauge data. The magnitude of both sets of strain (calculated and recorded) are very low, compared to the expected yield strength of the Zircaloy- 4 material. The model was accurate enough to predict that no yielding of the cladding was expected, but its precision at predicting micro strains is questionable. The SNL test data offers some opportunity for validation of the finite element model, but the specific loading conditions of the testing only excite the fuel assembly to respond in a limited manner. For example, the test accelerations were not strong enough to substantially drive the fuel assembly out of contact with the basket. Under this test scenario, the fuel assembly model does a reasonable job of approximating actual fuel assembly response, a claim that can be verified through direct comparison of model results to recorded test results. This does not offer validation for the fuel assembly model in all conceivable cases, such as high kinetic energy shock cases where the fuel assembly might lift off the basket floor to strike to basket ceiling. This type of nonlinear behavior was not witnessed in testing, so the model does not have test data to be validated against. a basis for validation in cases that substantially alter the fuel assembly response range. This leads to a gap in knowledge that is identified through this modeling study. The SNL shaker testing loaded a surrogate fuel assembly with a certain set of artificially-generated time histories. One thing all the shock cases had in common was an elimination of low frequency components, which reduces the rigid body dynamic response of the system. It is not known if the SNL test cases effectively bound all highway transportation scenarios, or if significantly greater rigid body motion than was tested is credible. This knowledge gap could be filled through modeling the vehicle dynamics of a used fuel conveyance, or by collecting acceleration time history data from an actual conveyance under highway conditions...|$|R

40|$|Air-cooled {{blast-furnace}} slag (BFS), {{a by-product}} of iron production, is recycled and often used as fill material for roads and other transportation structures. The use of this material in poorly drained areas can produce a greenish leachate, with high pH, elevated sulfate and dissolved solids concentrations, and hydrogen sulfide odor. The occurrence of this leachate from BFS used as fill on I- 65 in Northwest Indiana, {{has resulted in the}} Indiana Department of Transportation’s (INDOT) remedial action. The overall objective of this dissertation research was to explore the use of constructed wetlands to biologically and chemically eliminate the contamination properties of this leachate. Column, greenhouse, and field scale studies were used to investigate the use of media, plant combinations, and operating conditions to reduce total sulfur, high pH, and other contaminants. A <b>laboratory</b> <b>shaker</b> study was conducted to evaluate the leachate from slag and chemical constituents of BFS leachate. ^ The <b>laboratory</b> <b>shaker</b> study confirms that anoxic conditions are required to produce the green color of the leachate, as elevated sulfate concentrations were observed when the suspensions were oxidized. The column and greenhouse studies indicate that treatment systems utilizing organic media (peat and mushroom compost) were more effective for reducing pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), sulfate, and total sulfur. Mushroom compost, amended with zero valent iron (ZVI) and operated with a residence time of 14 days, was the most effective matrix for the removal of sulfate (67 %) and total sulfur (72 %). The greenhouse study shows the ability of macrophytes to lower pH, but they also transport oxygen to the root zone, oxidizing sulfur species. The field scale wetland indicates that reduction of sulfate, metals, TDS, and buffering of pH, can be achieved by the abiotic and biotic processes of the engineered system, under low flow conditions and with long residence times. The use of constructed wetlands is a viable, cost effective treatment option for this problem. Moreover, the use of organic biofilters, utilizing anaerobic conditions, sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), and ZVI, may prove to be the most effective for treating BFS leachate and other sources of elevated sulfur and TDS pollution. ...|$|E

The occurrence of FD was studied over two seasons using ‘Packham’s Triumph’ and ‘Doyenne du Comice’ (Pyrus communis) fruit. The influence of fruit maturity and storage duration were investigated by harvesting over three maturities and storing fruit {{for up to three}} months. FD was induced using a modified <b>laboratory</b> <b>shaker</b> that was shown to closely mimic pack line damage. Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity and total phenolics (TP) content were also evaluated. ‘Doyenne du Comice’ was more prone to FD than ‘Packham’s Triumph’. Harvest maturity significantly influenced FD susceptibility, with the middle picking maturity generally giving higher FD ratings. Increasing storage duration generally increased FD ratings, although not consistently. PPO activity was not influenced by harvest maturity, but was influenced by storage duration. In ‘Packham’s Triumph’, the TP content was not affected by harvest maturity or storage duration, whereas both these factors significantly influenced TP content in ‘Doyenne du Comice’. Susceptibility to development of FD symptoms is not easily linked to either PPO activity or TP content, and seasonal differences in susceptibility make prediction of possible levels of FD very difficult...|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{studying}} {{degrees of}} adherence ability to various surfaces were undertaken with presumably epizoochorous diaspores of 14 native and eight introduced species from southern California. A commonly available <b>laboratory</b> <b>shaker</b> was modified {{so as to}} provide a standard means for dislodging diaspores from surfaces. Diaspores were dropped onto a cloth-covered board and percentages of dislodged diaspores recorded after inversion and then after intervals of shaking. Three fabrics were used: a velvet with short pile, an artificial wood with short curly strands, and a furlike fabric with straight strands. Attachment to the velvet was nil for most species, showing that a lower threshold for strand length necessary to promote attachment exists. On the artificial wool, some species tended toward brief attachment, some toward prolonged attachment, and some were intermediate. Results with the furlike fabric were similar, but a difference {{could be seen in}} that diaspores with hooklike devices adhered better to the artificial wool; a few species (notably grasses with bristly awns) showed better adherence on the furlike fabric. Diaspores were also tested on natural animal surfaces (one feather and four fur samples). Natural substrates proved comparable to artificial counterparts. Distinctive categories of diaspores are evident, based upon diaspore morphology and adherence capability. Nature of surface proves more important than weight or size of the diaspore in promoting adherence...|$|E

40|$|Experimental modal {{analysis}} (EMA) of bridges and other civil structures {{can be used}} to acquire quantitative data describing their condition, and enhance opportunities for structural health monitoring and related fields. The use of EMA on civil structures has been limited by the high cost of the excitation devices that are required for the best data quality. The objective of the research reported herein is to evaluate a low-cost excitation system for multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) EMA, enabling the production of accurate estimates of the global behavior of in-service bridges. The prototype excitation system is composed of consumer entertainment devices, namely tactile transducers and subwoofer amplifiers, which are capable of providing excitation in the range of 5 Hz to 200 Hz. The use of these devices in vibration testing is unprecedented, and their low cost allows approximately 30 structural degrees-of-freedom to be excited {{for the price of a}} single purpose-built <b>laboratory</b> <b>shaker</b> device. Methods are developed to systematically characterize the operational performance of the devices. Research and testing are also performed to optimize the techniques by which the system can be used for MIMO EMA of bridges. The excitation system is then validated for MIMO EMA by dynamically characterizing a large-scale laboratory structure and comparing the results to those from traditional excitation methods. The system is then deployed on an in-service highway bridge, representing the first time that more than two shakers have been used in MIMO EMA testing of a bridge. The identification results using MIMO EMA are shown to be superior to those found using traditional excitation methods. Finally, the identified modal parameters of the in-service bridge are used in load rating. Direct use of the modal properties of a bridge for load rating is unprecedented, and a relatively simple method to use measured modal flexibility to help determine live load demand is developed herein. The bridge load ratings calculated from the new method are compared to traditional methods. In summary, a low-cost excitation system is optimized and systematically evaluated for MIMO EMA testing of civil structures, and the use of the system is validated in the laboratory and in the field. A new method to improve bridge rating reliability is then developed using the high quality modal parameters found via the optimized testing process...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Recently, {{employment}} of rotary tillers has been expanded in gardens and small farms, {{especially in the}} northern of Iran. However using the L-shaped blades in the conventional rotary tillers have some problems such as severe vibration problems, weeds stucking around the blades, forming the plow pan and lower performance due to the less powers of such small rototillers. Therefore in order to overcome the above mentioned problems, a rototiller with new ridged blades was designed, fabricated and tested in this research. Materials and Methods Experiments were carried out {{in one of the}} citrus orchards in Mazandaran, Sari. The experimental design was split plots based on randomized complete block design with three replications. The soil moisture as main plot varied in two levels of 13. 5 - 21. 9 and 21. 9 - 30. 3 percent based on dry weight and the rotational speed of blades as subplots varied in three levels of 140 - 170, 170 - 200 and 200 - 230 rpm. The measured parameters consist of soil particle mean weight diameter, soil bulk density, soil crumbling percentage, specific fuel consumption and machine efficiency. The diameter of soil particles was measured using a set of standard sieves with diameter ranging from 0. 5 to 8 mm. Then a <b>laboratory</b> <b>shaker</b> was used to sift the samples. Each sample was shaken in 30 sec. The fuel consumption during the experiments was determined by the filled fuel tank method. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and mean comparisons and interaction between the parameters were performed using the SPSS 16 software. Results and Discussion The results indicated that the soil particle mean weight diameter reduced by increasing blades rotational speed in both examined soil moisture contents. Results indicated that the soil crumbling percent increases with increasing the rotational speed. The main reason for this effect could be due to the more energy transferring to the soil at higher rotational speeds, which result in further crumbling of the soil slices. Regarding the results obtained in this study, the specific fuel consumption increased at first in a light slope, then in a steep rise with increasing the blades rotational speed. The reason can be the higher crumbling percent of the soil at higher rotational speeds and higher soil moisture contents (at the range of 21. 9 - 30. 3...|$|E
