50|$|Targets {{are marked}} with 10 evenly spaced {{concentric}} rings, which have score values from 1 through 10 assigned to them. In addition, {{there is an}} inner 10 ring, sometimes called the X ring. This becomes the 10 ring at indoor compound competitions. Outdoors, {{it serves as a}} tiebreaker with the archer scoring the most X's winning. Archers score each end by summing the scores for their arrows. <b>Line</b> <b>breakers,</b> an arrow just touching a scoring boundary line, will be awarded the higher score.|$|R
50|$|Located at 63 km (direct line) {{northeast}} of La Tuque downtown, 42 km (direct line) southwest of Chambord, and 21 km north east of Lac-Édouard, the Kiskissink lake {{has a very}} elongated shape in the north-south direction. The lake has a length of 11.2 km and a maximum width of 1.7 km (considering a bay). This lake is formed in parallel to the Grand Lake Bostonnais, located fifteen kilometers to the west side. Kiskissink Lake {{is located in the}} cantons of Rhodes and Lescarbot. The average level of the surface of the lake is at an altitude of 416 m. Some surrounding mountains exceed 460 m. Kiskissink the lake and its southern neighbor, the Lescarbot lake, are located along the boundary waters with the watershed of Lac Saint-Jean (Métabetchouan river); this <b>line</b> <b>breaker</b> is between one and two km (the east side) depending on location.|$|E
5000|$|Archers score {{each end}} by summing {{the scores for}} their arrows. An arrow just {{touching}} a scoring boundary line, known as a <b>Line</b> <b>Breaker</b> or Line Cutter, is awarded the higher score. Values scored by each arrow are recorded on a score sheet and must be written in descending order (e.g. if an archer scores 5, 7, 6, 10, 9, 8, this must be recorded as 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5). During and before scoring no one is allowed to touch the arrows. This is so {{that if there is}} disputed arrow score then a judge may be called and the judge makes a ruling on how the arrow lies. The archer in charge of scoring on a target at a tournament is known as the [...] and in larger tournaments, they may be assisted by a a Target Captain makes an initial judgment on all disputed arrows. Under WA rules, in major tournaments, after scoring, each hole is marked before arrows are retrieved. In the event of a [...] "pass through" [...] (the arrow passes straight through the target) or [...] "bouncer" [...] (arrow hits the target and bounces out), points may be awarded to an unmarked hole. Under AGB rules, and in some smaller tournaments, {{in the case of a}} bouncer, the archer must step off the shooting line and hold their bow in the air. A judge then decides whether the archer is permitted to shoot a replacement arrow. If an archer accidentally shoots more arrows than allowed, the highest scoring arrow is not counted and a miss is recorded.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2009. The {{intention}} of this dissertation is to determine, on the Eskom system, if the pre-insertion closing resistors {{installed on the}} Alpha-Beta 765 kV <b>line</b> <b>breakers</b> are preventing overvoltages from being caused during auto-reclosing. Other possible solutions of reclosing protection are investigated. It has been shown on two occasions, from actual field data that overvoltages have occurred on the lines after reclosing. High overvoltages on this network could {{be the cause of}} the many reactor failures that have occurred. A mathematical model of the Alpha-Beta 765 kV system was produced on Matlab/Simulink to simulate the resonance of the line during opening and then the effect on the voltage when reclosing takes place. The effects of installing pre-insertion resistors to reduce overvoltages on reclosing were analysed, as well as looking at controlled reclosing at the optimal voltage across the <b>line</b> <b>breakers.</b> It was shown from the studies, that pre-insertion resistors do limit the overvoltages to within the surge capabilities of the line (10 % overvoltage) and that the cause of the previous overvoltages were actually due to insertion resistor operations failure. It was also shown that the method of controlled closing at optimal voltage across the breakers is also a successful method of preventing overvoltages. This dissertation also evaluates a design specification for a switching relay for controlled re-closing of the line...|$|R

60|$|In a {{few moments}} the child was {{fastened}} to the spar, and the Otter began steadily to push it towards the shore; the dog swimming alongside, evidently much relieved at getting rid of his burden.

40|$|Abstract-This paper {{focuses on}} the {{reliability}} evaluation of modern substation automation systems. Such systems include both physical devices such as <b>lines,</b> <b>breakers,</b> and transformers, as well as cyber devices (switches, intelligent electronic devices, and cables) and belong to a broader class of cyber-physical systems. We assume that the substation utilizes IEC 61850 standard, which is a dominant standard for substation automation. Focusing on IEC 61850 standard, we present the failure modes and analyze their effects on the system. We utilize reliability block diagrams for analyzing the reliability of substation components (bay units) and then use the state space approach to study the effects at the substation level. The results of our analysis provide critical input to evaluating {{the reliability of the}} substation and the effects of substation failures {{to the rest of the}} power system.

60|$|As {{they neared}} the <b>line</b> of <b>breakers,</b> {{they could see}} heads of jagged rocks rising among them while, beyond, a belt of smooth water--a {{quarter of a mile}} wide--extended to the land.

60|$|The ship {{will have}} to lie-to, and anchor if she can; {{it may be a}} mile, it may be only a few yards, from the land.

60|$|One day {{she came}} {{and sat with}} him as he smoked his after-dinner pipe, leaning against an {{overturned}} boat, with his eyes fixed upon that <b>line</b> of gray <b>breakers.</b>|$|R
60|$|For some {{hours the}} Dutch skipper {{did his best}} to beat to windward, but in vain, the vessel drove nearer and nearer towards the shore; the anchors were got in readiness, and when within {{a quarter of a mile}} of the <b>line</b> of <b>breakers</b> the vessel's head was brought up into the wind, and the {{lashings}} of the two anchors cut simultaneously.|$|R
60|$|With {{the sheets}} hauled tight aft, the cutter was just able to lie her course, outside the <b>line</b> of <b>breakers.</b> In {{a little over}} an hour there was {{a break in the}} shore, and a stream of some forty feet wide fell into the sea; and a general cheer broke from the sailors, who had been put on {{allowance}} for the past week.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{focuses on}} {{reducing}} generators dispatch cost {{by means of}} transmission line switching. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) optimal power flow (OPF). A scalable heuristic algorithm is proposed to break-down {{the complexity of the}} problem due to the huge combinatorial space. The algorithm aims at providing the sequence of lines to be removed from service, one at the time, until no further decrease in the dispatch cost can be obtained. It identifies the line candidate for removal at each step by exploiting the (continuously relaxed values of) <b>lines</b> <b>breaker</b> statuses at the solution of a relaxed OPF problem. The algorithm thus relies on solving a sequence of OPF problems formulated as nonlinear programs (NLPs). The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on the IEEE 118 -bus system. Results show that the approach can provide good quality sub-optimal solutions with relatively small computational effort and by removing only few lines from service. I...|$|R
60|$|Before us {{we could}} see a {{continuous}} <b>line</b> of white-capped <b>breakers,</b> and so I led my little party to the right, hoping that we would soon see signs of an opening in the reef.|$|R
60|$|That hope soon vanished. One of the mates {{was sent}} {{to the top of the}} foremast, and descended with news that, as far as could be seen, the <b>line</b> of <b>breakers</b> {{stretched}} away, both on her beam and quarter. As the minutes went by the anxious crew could see, but too clearly, that the ship was drifting down upon the land; and that she must inevitably be wrecked upon it.|$|R
60|$|The {{vessel was}} bowling {{along at a}} {{moderate}} rate over a calm sea, for the light breeze overhead that failed to ruffle the water filled her topsails. Had the wind been stormy a <b>line</b> of <b>breakers</b> would have indicated the dangerous reef. As it was {{there was nothing to}} tell that the good ship was rushing on her doom till she struck with a violent shock and remained fast.|$|R
60|$|Then Walter {{stood up}} in the boat, took the keg and {{a foot or two}} of line in his hand, and waited till the next wave passed under the boat. He swung the keg round his head, and hurled it towards the shore. Then he dropped into his seat, and gave two or three {{vigorous}} strokes, and, when safely beyond the <b>line</b> of <b>breakers,</b> sat quiet and watched the result.|$|R
6000|$|I confess I thought so, too; but I ran on abreast, {{watching}} {{to see if the}} <b>line</b> of <b>breakers</b> from one side the entrance did not overlap the line from the other side. Sure enough, it did. A narrow place where the sea ran smooth appeared. [...] Charmian put down the wheel and steadied for the entrance. Martin threw on the engine, while all hands and the cook sprang to take in sail.|$|R
60|$|Several times, {{those in}} front were knocked down and rolled {{up on the}} beach, but three of the crew were brought in with them. There was one still missing, {{and there was a}} shout as he was seen, {{clinging}} to an oar, just outside the <b>line</b> of <b>breakers.</b> James Walsham had been working with the fishermen in saving those already brought to shore. He now fastened the end of a line round his body.|$|R
6000|$|It {{seemed an}} age, to the watchers, before a black spot {{appeared}} suddenly, beyond the foaming <b>line</b> of <b>breakers.</b> There {{was a general}} shout of [...] "There he is!" [...] But they had scarce time to note {{the position of the}} swimmer, when he again disappeared. Again and again he came up, each time rapidly decreasing the distance between himself and the shipwrecked vessel; and keeping his head above the waves for a few seconds, only, at each appearance.|$|R
60|$|Mahomed clambered aft, and {{got hold}} of the tiller, and with some {{difficulty}} Job, who had sometimes pulled a tub upon the homely Cam, got out his oar. In another minute the boat's head was straight on to the ever-nearing foam, towards which she plunged and tore {{with the speed of}} a racehorse. Just in front of us the first <b>line</b> of <b>breakers</b> seemed a little thinner than to the right or left--there was a cap of rather deeper water. I turned and pointed to it.|$|R

Further, we did research on setting of Power Swing Blocking (PSB) scheme to realize real applications...|$|R
