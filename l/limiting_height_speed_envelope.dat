40|$|We study a restricted-height {{version of}} the {{one-dimensional}} Oslo sandpile with conserved density, using periodic boundary conditions. Each site has a <b>limiting</b> <b>height</b> which can be either two or three. When a site reaches its <b>limiting</b> <b>height</b> it becomes active and may topple, loosing two particles, which move randomly to nearest-neighbor sites. After a site topples it is randomly assigned a new <b>limiting</b> <b>height.</b> We study the model using mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulation, focusing on the quasi-stationary state, in which the number of active sites fluctuates about a stationary value. Using finite-size scaling analysis, we determine the critical particle density and associated critical exponents.

The forming of box-shaped parts was simulated through numerical simulation software DYNAFORM from the different die radius size of shoulders and corners, the different BHF of straight and curved edges and different materials, etc [...] The results shows that, the forming <b>limit</b> <b>height</b> of box-shaped parts increases with the larger the die radius of shoulders and corners, and forming <b>limit</b> <b>height</b> of SS 304 in the materials studied is the highest, because it has larger yield strength; If the BHF of straight and curved edges has the constant size, the forming <b>limit</b> <b>height</b> of box-shaped parts will be lower when the BHF increases, while forming limit has a clear upward trend as blank holder force increases in the deep drawing processes which accords with the change law of resistance during the dislocation movement...|$|R

40|$|In the {{geotechnical}} engineering, the {{tensile failure}} of soil is disregarded {{for a long}} time. Actually, the tensile strength of soil is very low and the tensile failure really occurs, especially in the slope engineering. The <b>limit</b> <b>height</b> and active earth pressure of slope will change when considering the effect of tensile failure. In this paper, we {{try to figure out}} the <b>limit</b> <b>height</b> and active earth pressure of slope by using the new numerical limit analysis method, the ultimate strain method. The results, without considering tensile failure and with considering tensile failure, are compared with the analytical solutions. It is proved that the ultimate strain method is credible and feasible in the slope engineering. The result shows that the tensile strength has a great influence on the <b>limit</b> <b>height</b> of the unsupported slope, but little influence on supported slope. It also has obvious influence on the active earth pressure of supported slope when the value of tensile strength is small, and the smaller the tensile strength the larger the influence. But the earth pressure becomes stable when the value of tensile strength is over 10 [*]kN, and it is much close to the one calculated without considering the tensile failure...|$|R

40|$|Through a {{study of}} the van der Waals {{interaction}} between a solid and an air-water interface, we investigate the practical and fundamental problem of the <b>limiting</b> <b>height</b> which an object can approach a free surface. A numerical study of the interface shape reveals dependencies governed by two disparate length scales associated with the relative strengths of the van der Waals and bouyancy forces, respectively, to surface tension. A study of the limits of solvability of the governing equation has lead to the principal result: a closedform expression for the absolute <b>limiting</b> <b>height</b> to which an object can be lowered to the air-water interface. The formula depends explicitly and only on the Hamaker constant of the van der Waals force and the geometry of the solid. Imagine a child playing beside a pool of water, testin...|$|R
