5|$|After {{the initial}} {{transfer}} of forces in March 1901, further progress was slow as administrative and <b>legislative</b> <b>instruments</b> {{took time to}} develop. Indeed, {{it was not until}} 1 March 1904 that the Defence Act 1903 was proclaimed, providing the Commonwealth Military Forces a statutory framework within which they could operate. Amidst a background of political manoeuvring and personal agendas, the military forces were eventually reorganised into a more or less unified command structure. As a part of this, state-based mounted units were reformed into light horse regiments, supplemented by the transfer of men from a number of superfluous infantry units, while the remaining infantry were organised into battalions of the Australian Infantry Regiment and engineers and artillery were organised into field companies and garrison artillery batteries. Due to the provisions of the Defence Act which did not provide {{for the establishment of a}} regular infantry force, the notion that the Commonwealth Military Forces would be largely based on a part-time militia was set out in legislation.|$|E
5|$|In Europe golden jackals are {{not listed}} under the 1973 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora nor the 1979 Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. Golden jackals in Europe fall under various {{international}} legal instruments. These include the 1979 Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity, and the 1992 European Union Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna and Flora. The Council Directive provides both guidance and limits on what participating governments can do when {{responding to the}} arrival of expanding jackals. These <b>legislative</b> <b>instruments</b> aim to contribute to conserving native wildlife; some governments argue that the golden jackal is not native wildlife but an invading species. The Golden Jackal informal study Group in Europe (GOJAGE) is an organization that is formed by researchers from across Europe to collect and share information on the golden jackal in Europe. The group also has an interest in the golden jackal's relationship with its environment across Eurasia. Membership is open to anyone that has an interest in golden jackals.|$|E

2500|$|Boldrin and Levine {{conclude}} [...] "Our preferred policy {{solution is}} to abolish patents entirely and to find other <b>legislative</b> <b>instruments,</b> less open to lobbying and rent seeking, to foster innovation when there is clear evidence that laissez-faire undersupplies it." [...] Abolishing patents may be politically challenging in some countries, however, as the primary economic theories supporting patent law hold that inventors and innovators need patents to recoup {{the costs associated with}} research, inventing, and commercializing; this reasoning is weakened if the new technologies decrease these costs. A 2016 paper argued for substantial weakening of patents because current technologies (e.g. 3D printing, cloud computing, synthetic biology, etc.) have reduced the cost of innovation.|$|E
2500|$|The Slovak Constitution from 1992 {{asserts that}} the ‘state language’ on the {{territory}} of the Slovak Republic is Slovak. At the same time this constitution entails explicit provisions for minorities, including language right. These provisions were reinforced in 2001. International treaties like the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (ratified by Slovakia in 1995) or the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages (ratified by Slovakia in 2001) and the 1995 Treaty on Good Neighbourly Relations and Friendly Cooperations [...] between Slovakia and Hungary protect the language rights of minorities. Article 34. of the 1992 constitution asserts that [...] "citizens of ethnic minorities {{have the right to be}} educated in their language, the right to use it in dealings with authorities, and the right to participate in the solution of affairs concerning national minorities and ethnic groups". These provisions afford a high standard of protection, but still, these <b>legislative</b> <b>instruments</b> do not warrant the implementation of the postulated rights. In most cases the disfrancishement evolves when there is insufficient political will to legislate the provisions as laws. This happened between 1992 and 1998 (i.e. under Mečiar's government).|$|E

5000|$|Enforcing {{environmental}} {{laws and regulations}} is an important ingredient in protecting the environment and reducing environmental harm. This is generally achieved by various environmental law enforcement agencies operating at an International, Regional, National, State and Local level. For instance, to some extent environmental law enforcement agencies operate only at an international level whereas others only operate at the local level. Furthermore, environmental law enforcement agencies utilise various enforcement methods to ensure compliance to environmental legislation. In some cases enforcement agencies rely on coercive powers to demand compliance to {{environmental laws}}, generally labelled “command and control” strategies, while others rely on conciliatory and educational strategies to persuade individuals, organisations and governments to comply with environmental laws and regulations. Moreover, it has increased the need for cooperation between different policing institutions.Environmental law enforcement agencies and police services do not operate in a vacuum; the <b>legislative</b> <b>instruments</b> that political systems implement govern their activities and responsibilities within society. However, ostensibly it is the <b>legislative</b> <b>instruments</b> implemented by governments that determine many of the strategies utilised by police services in protecting the environment. Generally these International, Regional, National and State <b>legislative</b> <b>instruments</b> are designed to ensure industries, individuals, and governments comply with the various environmental obligations embedded in national statutes and laws. There are also international legal instruments and treaties that also affect the way that sovereign states deal with environmental issues [...]|$|E
