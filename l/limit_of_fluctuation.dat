40|$|For {{fluctuating}} {{currents in}} non-equilibrium steady states, the recently discovered thermodynamic uncertainty relation expresses a fundamental relation between their variance {{and the overall}} entropic cost associated with the driving. We show that this relation holds {{not only for the}} long-time <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>fluctuations,</b> as described by large deviation theory, but also for fluctuations on arbitrary finite time scales. This generalization facilitates applying the thermodynamic uncertainty relation to single molecule experiments, for which infinite timescales are not accessible. Importantly, often this finite-time variant of the relation allows inferring a bound on the entropy production that is even stronger than the one obtained from the long-time limit. We illustrate the relation for the fluctuating work that is performed by a stochastically switching laser tweezer on a trapped colloidal particle. Comment: 7 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|The non-equilibrium {{dynamics}} {{of a system}} that is located in the vicinity of a quantum critical point is affected by the critical slowing down of order-parameter correlations with the potential for novel out-of-equilibrium universality. After a quantum quench, i. e. a sudden change of a parameter in the Hamiltonian such a system is expected to almost instantly fall out of equilibrium and undergo aging dynamics, i. e. dynamics that depends on the time passed since the quench. Investigating the quantum {{dynamics of}} a N-component φ^ 4 -model coupled to an external bath, we determine this universal aging and demonstrate that the system undergoes a coarsening, governed by a critical exponent that is unrelated to the equilibrium exponents of the system. We analyze this behavior in the large-N limit, which is complementary to our earlier renormalization group analysis, allowing in particular the direct investigation of the order-parameter dynamics in the symmetry broken phase and at the upper critical dimension. By connecting the long time <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>fluctuations</b> and response, we introduce a distribution function that shows that the system remains non-thermal and exhibits quantum coherence even on long timescales.
