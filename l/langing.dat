40|$|Abstract. When {{designing}} a landing gear damper, it is well-known that damper characteristics required for good handling {{are not the}} same as those required for good ride comfort. Semi-active control landing gear damper, as their name implies, fill the gap between purely passive damper and fully active control <b>Langing</b> gear-control systems and offer the reliability of passive systems, yet maintain the versatility and adaptability of fully active devices. During recent years there has been considerable interest towards theoretical study and practical practical implementation of this semi-active control landing gear damper for their low energy requirement and cost. For this reason, The basic theoretical for semi-active landing gear damper design and implementation has been briefly reviewed, mathematical model of semi-active control landing gear is established. A state feedback semi-active controller is designed. At last, the passive control landing gear model and semi-active control landing gear model are simulated. Simulation result shows that the vibration of passive control landing gear is vehement, and the system stable time is long. But in the simi-active control landing gear system the impact load and vibraton can be reduced, the aircraft can reach the stability state in a few seconds. Using linear quadratic optimal control effect is good. Intorductio...|$|E

40|$|Dit is duidelik dat <b>Lang</b> <b>Lang</b> se populariteit, wat selfs tot buite die sfeer van klassieke musiek strek, hom ’n uitsonderlike figuur as klassieke pianis in ’n populêremusiek-gedrewe bedryf maak. Benewens talle gepubliseerde onderhoude, artikels en resensies is daar tot op hede nog geen poging aangewend om <b>Lang</b> <b>Lang</b> se omstrede uitvoeringstyl omvattend te ondersoek nie. Die doel van hierdie studie is dus om die unieke samestelling van <b>Lang</b> <b>Lang</b> as uitvoerende kunstenaar na te speur. Die data wat gebruik is, sluit onder andere resensies, koerantberigte, tydskrifartikels, transkripsies van radio-onderhoude, gepubliseerde onderhoude, gepubliseerde CV’s en outobiografieë in. Aspekte van <b>Lang</b> <b>Lang</b> se spel wat behandel word, is sy verhoogpersoonlikheid, vingervaardigheid en algemene virtuositeit, krag en uithouvermoë, gebruik van dinamiek, die invloed van sy fisieke benadering tot klavierspel op sy interpretasies, sy tempokeuse en uiteindelik sy interpretatiewe “resep”. Daarna volg ’n bespreking van <b>Lang</b> <b>Lang</b> se eie sienings aangaande interpretasie. Daar is bevind dat <b>Lang</b> <b>Lang</b> as gevolg van sy opvallende virtuose tegniek alom as ’n virtuoos en uiteindelik as ’n totale vertoonkunstenaar beskou word. ’n Algemene siening is dat <b>Lang</b> <b>Lang</b> se uitgangspunt om sy besondere beheer oor tempo en klankkleur ten beste te vertoon, die samehangende struktuur van die werke wat hy uitvoer, asook tradisionele beskouings oor stylkenmerke, ondermyn. Verder is <b>Lang</b> <b>Lang</b> se uitsprake aangaande sy benadering tot interpretasie dikwels aanvegbaar en teenstrydig. Dit is egter duidelik dat hy geensins die etiket “vertoonkunstenaar” (“showman”) berou nie. Hy steur hom ook geensins aan kritiek nie en is getrou aan homself in sy interpretasies. It {{is clear}} that <b>Lang</b> <b>Lang’s</b> popularity, which extends itself even beyond the sphere of {{classical}} music, has made him an extraordinary figure as a classical pianist in a popularmusic- driven industry. Apart from many published interviews, articles and music reviews, there has not appeared until now an attempt at investigating extensively <b>Lang</b> <b>Lang’s</b> contentious performance style. What are the characteristics which contribute {{to the fact that}} <b>Lang</b> <b>Lang’s</b> pianism is regarded as unique? What makes him such an exceptional phenomenon? What are the specific qualities of a pianist who reaches fame so quickly? What is the essence of <b>Lang</b> <b>Lang</b> as a performing artist? And how do reviewers feel about his performances? The aim of this article is, therefore, to trace <b>Lang</b> <b>Lang’s</b> inimitable personality as a performing artist. The research design for this article can be described as a qualitative and ethnographic approach to an individual case study. More specifically, Babbie and Mouton’s “life history” technique is applied (2001 : 283 – 7). According to Babbie and Mouton (2001 : 283) this type of research is characterised by intensive observation {{of the life of the}} topic of study, the use of sound recordings and interviews with friends, and the scrutiny of letters and photos. The data concerning <b>Lang</b> <b>Lang</b> employed in this study include music reviews in papers and magazines, reports in daily papers, articles in magazines, transcripts of radio interviews, published interviews, published CVs and autobiographies. The “life history” technique is further characterised by an interest in the subjective reality of the individual, a focus on process and change, a perspective on the totality, and the use of this kind of research method as a historical and social tool (Babbie and Mouton 2001 : 283, 284). A disadvantage encountered when using the “life history” technique is that the results of an individual case study cannot easily be generalised. The strength of this type of research is, however, that the researcher can move between the biography of the individual study object and the historical or social history within which this research object finds him/herself (Babbie and Mouton 2001 : 283, 284). Plummer (2001 : 31 - 32) describes an “ethnographic biography” in the following manner: Many ethnographies may be seen as partly composed of the stories people tell of their lives. [ [...] . ] The study gets close to their experiences – and though they are the centre of the stories, they are linked to an array of significant others reacting to them: professionals, parents, other children. Here the focus is the ethnographic study of lives, whilst broad theoretical links are made to communication and ethnomethodology. The reaction of such “significant others” – in this case the reaction of <b>Lang</b> <b>Lang’s</b> audiences and the media – can be regarded as the “social history” of his presentations with broad theoretical references to reception theory, interpretation, adherence to the text and virtuosity. Aspects of <b>Lang</b> <b>Lang’s</b> playing that are discussed are his stage personality, finger dexterity and general virtuosity, power and stamina, use of dynamics, the influence of his physical approach to piano playing on his interpretations, his choice of tempo, and eventually his interpretative “recipe” and adherence to the text. A discussion of <b>Lang</b> <b>Lang’s</b> own views on interpretation is also included. A variety of aspects which form an integral part of <b>Lang</b> <b>Lang’s</b> pianistic make-up was identified during the course of the study. It is obvious that any concert pianist would possess a virtuoso technique, but <b>Lang</b> <b>Lang’s</b> dexterity, power, endurance and ability to manipulate sound colours to their finest nuances receive extraordinary attention in the media coverage of his performances. Because of <b>Lang</b> <b>Lang’s</b> exceptional virtuoso technique he is often referred to in reviews as a sportsman. Ultimately, <b>Lang</b> <b>Lang</b> is generally not only regarded as a virtuoso but as the complete showman. A visual approach to piano playing has been a common phenomenon since the times of Franz Liszt and Anton Rubinstein. What distinguishes <b>Lang</b> <b>Lang</b> from his fellow virtuosos over the course of the centuries, however, is not simply the presence of a visual approach in his playing, but rather the ebullient joy of his music-making which he projects to his audience. In addition, <b>Lang</b> <b>Lang’s</b> concert attire is different from the traditional black swallow-tailed coat and bow-tie used by many musicians on stage. He prefers to wear a brightly coloured Tang dynasty suit which alludes to his Oriental origins. It seems as though <b>Lang</b> <b>Lang’s</b> visual impact, and especially his joyful and youthful appearance, as well as his Oriental attire, contribute as much to his success as a showman as his technical prowess. Reviewers do not necessarily agree with the expediency of the influence of <b>Lang</b> <b>Lang’s</b> showmanship on his interpretation of the compositions he performs. It is evident from many reviews that <b>Lang</b> <b>Lang’s</b> pianism consists of a combination of four extremes: bombastically loud, sentimentally soft, a breakneck pace, and dreamlike, lingering tempos. Reference is made by reviewers to <b>Lang</b> <b>Lang’s</b> “interpretative recipe” and patented approach to interpretation. Many agree that it is <b>Lang</b> <b>Lang’s</b> aim to display his extraordinary control over tempo and colour at its best, but that these endeavours undermine the structure of the composition he performs as well as traditional views about the characteristics of style. Many are shocked by <b>Lang</b> <b>Lang’s</b> contempt of the music text. <b>Lang</b> <b>Lang’s</b> controversial interpretations are, however, “forgiven” by his listeners, as he obviously derives so much pleasure from his performances. <b>Lang</b> <b>Lang’s</b> views on his approach to interpretation are often contradictory. He often asserts that attention to responsible interpretation is more important to him than the urge to see how fast or how loudly he can play, and that a balance between the emotions and the intellect in performance is of utmost importance. On the other hand he declares on many occasion that the pianist is no copying machine and that the pianist must possess his own fantasies. <b>Lang</b> <b>Lang</b> has no regrets about the epithet “showman”. He is not affected by the criticism of his playing and remains true to himself in his interpretations. Ultimately <b>Lang</b> <b>Lang</b> comes to the conclusion: “Controversy sells. ”[URL]...|$|R
