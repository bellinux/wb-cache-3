5|$|The Japanese {{government}} encouraged {{farmers to}} raise sheep throughout the 19th-century. Sheep-rearing programs began to import Yorkshire, Berkshire, Spanish merino, and numerous Chinese and Mongolian sheep breeds, encouraged by government promotion of sheep farming. However, a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> on the farmer's part {{of how to}} successfully keep sheep, and the government's failure to provide information to those importing the sheep they promoted, led to the project's failure, and in 1888 it was discontinued.|$|E

However Hansell also argued that ignorance of radar was fortuitous in the long run. He surmised that had radar been a factor in making doctrine, many theorists would have reasoned that massed defenses would make all strategic air attacks too costly, inhibiting if not entirely suppressing the concepts that proved decisive in World War II and essential {{to the creation of the}} United States Air Force.|$|E
5|$|About an {{hour after}} {{fragment}} K entered Jupiter, observers recorded auroral emission near the impact region, {{as well as at}} the antipode of the impact site with respect to Jupiter's strong magnetic field. The cause of these emissions was difficult to establish due to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> of Jupiter's internal magnetic field and of the geometry of the impact sites. One possible explanation was that upwardly accelerating shock waves from the impact accelerated charged particles enough to cause auroral emission, a phenomenon more typically associated with fast-moving solar wind particles striking a planetary atmosphere near a magnetic pole.|$|E

More problematic is determining how Cranmer worked on the book and with whom he worked. Despite the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> of who might have helped him, however, he is given the credit for the editorship and the overall structure of the book.|$|E

5|$|P. S. Raman, {{who went}} to Chennai in 1963 to join a medical college, was asked to see Sridhar, who was auditioning {{newcomers}} for the film. Raman was renamed Ravichandran and introduced in this film, as the character Ashok. Sivakumar had auditioned for the role before it went to Ravichandran. During a flight, Sridhar met an air-hostess named Vasundhara Devi and approached her to play one of the female leads. Because she shared her name with Vasundhara Devi, the mother of actress Vyjayanthimala, Sridhar renamed her Kanchana to avoid confusion. Telugu actor Krishna has stated that he was offered {{a role in the}} film by Sridhar, but he could not accept it due to his <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> in Tamil.|$|E
5|$|Around 59 {{species of}} {{pigeons and doves}} are {{threatened}} with extinction today, about 19% of all species. Most of these are tropical and live on islands. All of the species are threatened by introduced predators, habitat loss, hunting, {{or a combination of}} these factors. In some cases, they may be extinct in the wild, as is the Socorro dove of Socorro Island, Mexico, last seen in the wild in 1972, driven to extinction by habitat loss and introduced feral cats. In some areas, a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> means the true status of a species is unknown; the Negros fruit dove has not been seen since 1953, and {{may or may not be}} extinct, and the Polynesian ground dove is classified as critically endangered, as whether it survives or not on remote islands in the far west of the Pacific Ocean is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Meena takes Rahul to {{her father}} and {{introduces}} him as her lover. Tangaballi challenges Rahul to a duel that Rahul unknowingly accepts, due to his <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> in Tamil. On {{the night of the}} duel, Rahul escapes {{with the help of a}} local policeman, Shamsher (Mukesh Tiwari), but he ends up on a ship with Sri Lankan terrorists and smugglers. A gun battle ensues between the police force and the terrorists. When the police officers investigate and take Rahul into custody, he tells his story and ends up back in Komban. Terrified and once again surrounded by Azhagusundaram's sickle-wielding henchmen, Rahul pretends to take Meena hostage and escapes with her in her father's car, battling Azhagasundaram's men. When the car breaks down, Rahul and Meena quarrel and part ways. Rahul, not knowing which way to go, returns to Meena, who takes him to the Vidhamba village. Meena tells the villagers that they are a married couple who needs protection and rest, to which the villagers agree.|$|E

40|$|English as an {{international}} language {{plays an important role}} in crosscultural communication. The main function of language is communication and pragmatic competence is an important component of communicative competence. So <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> pragmatic <b>knowledge</b> leads to pragmatic failure and it prevents from being successful in crosscultural communication. Since pragmatic failure closely relates to English learners’ <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> pragmatic <b>knowledge</b> and understanding <b>of</b> the culture of the target language, in order to improve pragmatic and communicative competence, cultural information and pragmatic knowledge should be incorporated into English language...|$|R
5|$|The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) first {{listed the}} two known species of slow loris under Appendix II on 7January1975. All newly {{identified}} species {{were covered by}} Appendix II on 2April1977 when all primates were given either Appendix I or Appendix II protection. Appendix II only requires an export permit for international trade, as long as trade will not negatively impact the survival of wild populations. Most of the trade in slow lorises, however, is illegal and usually involves smuggling to Japan. The lack of legal trade reported to the CITES Secretariat {{is shown in the}} CITES trade database, where minimal trade by CITES Parties has been reported up until 2007. Regardless, slow lorises remained vulnerable to international trade under Appendix II, and the rampant Southeast Asian pet trade was another reason for concern. As a result, Cambodia proposed that slow lorises be elevated to Appendix I, which prohibits species from being traded internationally for commercial purposes and requires both import and export permits for certain types of non-commercial trade, such as scientific research. The proposal covered all three species recognized at the time—the Sunda slow loris, Bengal slow loris, and pygmy slow loris—because they have traditionally been managed collectively owing to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> as to how to distinguish them.|$|E

We derive analytical expressions for the capacity cumulative distribution functions which are verified by means of simulations. We show that the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> exact <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the PU-PU channel gain by the SU-Tx either prohibits SU transmission or necessitates high interference level at the PU.
