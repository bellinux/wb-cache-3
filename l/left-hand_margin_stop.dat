40|$|The Lancelot Compilation (The Hague, Royal Library, 129 A 10) is a {{manuscript}} from around 1320 - 1325, that comprises ten Middle Dutch Arthurian romances. Four of these ten narratives contain alterations {{that were made}} by an anonymous scribe, who {{became known as the}} Corrector of the Middle Dutch Lancelot Compilation. The name ‘Corrector’ is somewhat misleading, since the correction of mistakes in the scribal text is only a part of the Corrector’s activities: he also made alterations of other kinds, such as the addition of punctuation marks and small words, often in the <b>left-hand</b> <b>margin</b> of the text. In 1976, W. P.

40|$|New swath {{bathymetry}} with multichannel {{and high}} resolution seismic profiles shows {{a variety of}} contourite drift, sediment wave morphologies, and seismic facies in the central Scotia Sea. The deposits {{are to be found}} at the confluence between the two most important bottom current flows in the southern ocean: the eastward flowing Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and the northward outflow of the Weddell Sea Deep Water (WSDW). The contourite drifts are wedge-like deposits up to 1 km thick, that exhibit aggradational reflectors along axis thinning towards the margins. The contourite drifts occur in areas of weaker flows along the margins of contourite channels and in areas protected by obstacles. The elongate-mounded drifts are best developed along the <b>left-hand</b> <b>margins</b> of channelized bottom current flows, due to the Coriolis force. A contourite fan has a main channel and two distributary channels that expand over a gentle seafloor. The proximal fan exhibits sediment waves with the distal fan incised by furrows. Sediment wave fields are well developed in areas of intensified bottom flows without channels, particularly at the confluence of the ACC and the WSDW. Small sediment waves occur where unidirectional bottom current flows predominate. Sediment waves may develop under the influence of internal waves produced by the interaction of th...|$|R

40|$|Mass-balance {{analysis}} of the Greenland ice sheet based on surface elevation changes observed by the European Remote-sensing Satellite (ERS) (1992 - 2002) and Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) (2003 - 07) indicates that the strongly increased mass loss at lower elevations (< 2000 m) of the ice sheet, as observed during 2003 - 07, appears to induce interior ice thinning at higher elevations. In this paper, we perform a perturbation experiment with a three-dimensional anisotropic ice-flow model (AIF model) to investigate this upstream propagation. Observed thinning rates in the regions below 2000 m elevation are used as perturbation inputs. The model runs with perturbation for 10 years show that the extensive mass loss at the ice-sheet margins does in fact cause interior thinning on short timescales (i. e. decadal). The modeled pattern of thinning over the ice sheet agrees with the observations, which implies that the strong mass loss since the early 2000 s at low elevations has had a dynamic impact on the entire ice sheet. The modeling results also suggest {{that even if the}} large mass loss at the <b>margins</b> <b>stopped,</b> the interior ice sheet would continue thinning for 300 years and would take thousands of years for full dynamic recovery...|$|R

Work on his book very slow and does not feel capable of producing a second and in future will send his notes to Smith or publish them through Linnean Society; feels he would be more useful to Smith botanising in his garden and in the wild.

40|$|Geologically the mid-Norwegian {{continental}} shelf (62 °- 69 ° 30 ’N) has undergone several phases of rifting, uplifting and erosion, but the present {{shape of the}} shelf/margin developed during Plio/Pleistocene time. During late Neogene a thick succession of Naust Formation prograded westward. This prograding wedge built out as an interaction of several processes like climatic fluctuations, relative sea level changes, glacial processes, basin infill and development of continental ice sheets in Scandinavia. The {{purpose of this study}} is to do sequence stratigraphic analysis of the Late-Cenozoic outbuilding. Ten 2 D seismic lines of high resolution from offshore mid-Norway were interpreted. Sequence stratigraphic analysis reveals 32 seismic sequences developed by 30 glaciation during last 2. 8 m. y. Facies analysis describes different kinds of sedimentary environments that was active during deposition of Naust Formation. Ages of the seismic sequences within the Naust Formation (2. 8 Ma-Present) have been interpolated between key horizons dated in previous studies. The known glaciations from Iceland and Svalbard margin are correlated with this study. The correlations indicate chances of more glaciations during last 2. 8 m. y than resolved by the existing date from Iceland and Svalbard margins if high resolution data is available. Relative sea level changes occurred frequently during deposition of the Naust Formation.
