40|$|The {{impact of}} abiotic factors on kelp {{sporophyte}} reproduction {{has rarely been}} investigated. Laminaria digitata (Hudson) J. V. Lamouroux {{is one of the}} few summer fertile <b>Laminaria</b> <b>species</b> worldwide and reproduction is subjected to relatively high water temperatures. We investigated the impact of prevailing summer temperatures (18 °C in August) on the induction of sporangia, meiospore release, and germination at the island of Helgoland (North Sea). At Helgoland, fertile sporophytes are found between April and December with a maximum in late summer. While released meiospore numbers were constant between June and October, germination rates decreased significantly in summer. Short-term exposure of mature sori to 17 °C– 22 °C induced a significantly higher meiospore release indicating enhancement of sporulation by elevated temperatures. Induction of sporangia on vegetative blade disks was not possible at 20 °C, and fertility was only 20...|$|E
40|$|Epiphytic {{bacteria}} {{associated with}} {{different parts of}} the fronds (blade or meristem) of the sublittoral brown algae Laminaria hyperborea, L. digitata and L. saccharina were investigated by cultivation and cultivation-independent techniques. Each <b>Laminaria</b> <b>species</b> was sampled from both inter- and sub-tidal zones of the island Helgoland, North Sea. Preliminary characterization of the bacterial communities was performed by DAPI staining as well as by community-level physiological profiling using BIOLOG Eco plates. For bacterial cultivation, agar plates were prepared from extracts of the particular algal species. The cultivated isolates were fingerprinted using repPCR and the 16 S rRNA genes of different isolates were subsequently sequenced. Laminaria-associated bacterial communities have to prevail over other competing bacteria. One strategy might be the production of secondary metabolites with bioactivity to defend their position within the particular association. Therefore, isolates were investigated by chemical screening and bioassays with a defined battery of test organisms (bacteria, algae and fungi) were used. From the three Laminaria, 36 isolates could be cultivated of which 24 cultures display unique fingerprints. Several of them show middle to high bioactivity against either Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptomyces viridochromogenes, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans or Mucor miehei. To compare the number of cultivates with the in situ diversity, additionally, bacterial DNA was isolated directly from the algae for subsequent DGGE analysis based on 16 S rDNA sequences. Results of DGGE analyses indeed suggest differences in both composition and diversity of associated bacteria, with respect to specific algal species, frond parts and sampling sites...|$|E

40|$|Global {{climate change}} is {{increasing}} the surface waters of the oceans and driving species to alter their biogeographical distributions {{in an attempt to}} remain within each species' specific temperature tolerance limits. One example of this is the kelp Laminaria ochroleuca which was first recorded off the South West UK coast in the 1940 's. In recent years L. ochroleuca has become more abvmdant in UK waters and begun to out compete other <b>Laminaria</b> <b>species</b> such as Laminaria digitata. The kelp holdfasts are important habitats for a great number of different species. Any change in species composition of inhabitants within these kelp holdfasts may have significant ecological effects. Anti-fouling exudates present within L. ochroleuca are not present in L. digitata and this difference may be causing different assemblages to initially colonize and consequently inhabit each kelp species' holdfast. By identifying and recording species abundance within each holdfast, a comparison of species composition and the functional trophic roles (Carnivore, Herbivore Detrivore Primary producer and Suspension feeder) performed by these epibionts was undertaken and compared between kelp holdfast species. Results indicated a difference in the composition of the species inhabiting L. ochroleuca and L. digitata holdfasts. Although the assemblages were different between kelp species' holdfasts, there was evidence to show that the species which varied were closely related and performed the same ecological roles within the ecosystem. It is concluded that the recent changes in these two kelp species distributions may significantly alter the biodiversity of epibionts although should have little effect on ecosystem fimction in UK coastal waters...|$|E
40|$|Seaweed {{beds are}} very {{important}} for abalones and sea urchins as a habitat. In Sanriku Coast, these animals are target species of coastal fisheries. The huge tsunami hit Sanriku Coast facing Pacific Ocean on 11 March 2011. It is needed for fishermen to know present situation of seaweed beds and understand damages of the huge tsunami on natural environments to recover coastal fisheries. We selected Shizugawa Bay as a study site because abalone catch of Shizugawa Bay occupied the first position in Sanriku Coast. To evaluate impact of tsunami on seaweed beds, we compared high spatial resolution satellite image of Shizugawa Bay before the tsunami with that after the tsunami by remote sensing with ground surveys to know impact of the tsunami on seaweed beds. We used two multi-band imageries of commercial high-resolution satellite, Geoeye- 1, which were taken on 4 November 2009 before the tsunami and on 22 February 2012 after the tsunami. Although divers observed the tsunami damaged a very small part of Eisenia bicyclis distributions on rock substrates at the bay head, it was not observed clearly by satellite image analysis. On the other hand, we found increase in seaweed beds after the tsunami from the image analysis. The tsunami broke concrete breakwaters, entrained {{a large amount of}} rocks and pebble from land to the sea, and disseminated them in the bay. Thus, hard substrates suitable for attachment of seaweeds were increased. Ground surveys revealed that seaweeds consisting of E. bicyclis, Sargassum and <b>Laminaria</b> <b>species</b> grew on these hard substrates on the sandy bottom...|$|E
40|$|Direct {{cultivation}} {{of the first}} filial generation of gametophyte clones from different <b>Laminaria</b> <b>species</b> is a highly effective way of utilizing kelp heterozygous vigor (heterosis). A male gametophyte clone of L. longissima Miyabe and a female one of L. japonica Areschoug were hybridized, generating Dongfang No. 2 hybrid kelp. This hybrid kelp was used directly in trial cultivation, and its agronomical traits were evaluated. L. longissima and L. japonica are obviously different and complement {{each other in their}} morphological characteristics and ecological performances. The hybrid of their gametophyte clones, Dongfang No. 2, showed 56. 8 % heterozygous vigor in yield. It also showed increased yields of 41. 0 and 76. 4 % compared to the widely used commercial kelps Variety 1 and Variety 2, respectively. In large-scale cultivation trials at different locations and in different years, Dongfang No. 2 attained significantly higher yields than Varieties 1 and 2, increasing yield by 26. 4 % on average over Variety 1 and by 65. 0 % over the other. Dongfang No. 2 has a robust holdfast and a wide, long and deep-brown uniform blade, which shows a distinct middle groove. In addition to yield, Dongfang No. 2 also demonstrates obvious heterozygous vigor in other agronomic traits. It is resistant to strong irradiance, as the two commercial varieties are, has an appropriate vegetative maturation time, and adapts well to a range of different culture conditions. The parentage analysis using AFLP of total DNA and SNP of the ITS region of ribosomal RNA transcription unit showed that Dongfang No. 2 is the real hybrid of L. japonica and L. longissima...|$|E
40|$|Habitat forming species, such as reef-building corals and canopy-forming macroalgae, {{can alter}} {{environmental}} conditions and provide habitat for {{a vast array}} of marine life, from invertebrates to marine mammals. This investigation examines the consequences of recent shifts in the relative abundances of two species of kelp, a warm water <b>species,</b> <b>Laminaria</b> ochroleuca, and a cool water <b>species,</b> <b>Laminaria</b> hyperborea, by defining their properties as habitat-formers and comparing their epibiotic assemblages. Algal and invertebrate assemblages associated with kelp stipes and holdfasts were compared between the two species, and from two sites with differing environmental conditions. Significant differences were found in the structure of assemblages inhabiting both the stipe and holdfast between species, and between sites. The results suggest that local environmental conditions influence the structure of these assemblages. This study shows that changes in the relative abundances of habitat forming species, as a consequence of rapid environmental change, alter local biodiversity patterns and potentially lead to impoverished assemblages. Crucially, while the structure of habitat-forming species may appear broadly similar, their functioning as biogenic habitats for associated biota may differ considerably.

50|$|In a {{representative}} <b>species</b> <b>Laminaria,</b> {{there is a}} conspicuous diploid generation and smaller haploid generations. Meiosis takes place within several unilocular sporangium along the algae's blade, each one forming either haploid male or female zoospores. The spores are then released from the sporangia and grow to form male and female gametophytes. The female gametophyte produces an egg in the oogonium, and the male gametophyte releases motile sperm that fertilize the egg. The fertilized zygote then grows into the mature diploid sporophyte.|$|R

40|$|Background: Among various feed {{additives}} currently used in poultry nutrition, {{an important role}} is played by bioactive substances, including prebiotics. The beneficial effect of these bioactive substances on the gastrointestinal tract and immune system give rise to improvements in broiler health and performance nutrition, thus increasing the productivity of these birds. An innovative method for introducing bioactive substances into chickens is the in ovo injection into eggs intended for hatching. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the development of histomorphological parameters of the duodenum and productivity in chickens injected in ovo with the prebiotic DiNovo® (extract of <b>Laminaria</b> <b>species</b> of seaweed, BioAtlantis Ltd., Ireland) on d 12 of incubation, under large - scale, high density poultry production conditions. Results: There was no significant impact of the injection of DiNovo® prebiotic on the production parameters of broiler chickens (body weight, FCR, EBI and mortality) obtained on d 42 of rearing. No significant impact of the DiNovo® injection on the duodenum weight and length was observed, as well as on the CSA, diameter and muscular layer thickness of the duodenum. The in ovo injection of DiNovo® significantly increased the width of the duodenal villi (P[*]<[*] 0. 05) and crypt depth (P[*]<[*] 0. 01) of chickens on d 21 of rearing. Other histomorphological parameters of duodenal villi at d 42 of chickens rearing such as: the height, width, and cross section area of villi were significantly greater in chickens from the control group compared to those from the DiNovo® group (P[*]<[*] 0. 05 and P[*]<[*] 0. 01). Conclusions: In conclusion, this study demonstrates that injection of DiNovo® prebiotic into the air chamber of egg significantly influences the histomorphological parameters on d 21 of rearing without negatively affecting productivity in chickens at the end of rearing...|$|E
40|$|We {{present results}} of three field campaigns using active longpath DOAS (Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy) {{for the study}} of {{reactive}} halogen species (RHS) BrO, IO, OIO and I 2. Two recent field campaigns took place in Spring 2002 in Dageb at the German North Sea Coast and in Spring 2003 in Lilia at the French Atlantic Coast of Brittany. In addition, data from a campaign in Mace Head, Ireland in 1998 was partly re-evaluated. During the recent field campaigns volatile halogenated organic compounds (VHOCs) were determined by a capillary gas chromatograph coupled with an electron capture detector and an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (GC/ECD-ICPMS) in air and water. Due to the inhomogeneous distribution of macroalgae at the German North Sea Coast we found a clear connection between elevated levels of VHOCs and the appearance of macroalgae. Extraordinarily high concentrations of several VHOCs, especially CH 3 I and CH 3 Br of up to 1830 pptv and 875 pptv, respectively, were observed at the coast of Brittany, demonstrating the outstanding level of bioactivity there. We found CH 2 I 2 at levels of up to 20 pptv, and a clear anti-correlation with the appearance of IO. The IO mixing ratio reached up to 7. 7 ± 0. 5 ppt(pmol/mol) during the day, in reasonable agreement with model studies designed to represent the meteorological and chemical conditions in Brittany. For the two recent campaigns the DOAS spectra were evaluated for BrO, OIO and I 2, but none of these species could be clearly identified (average detection limits around 2 ppt, 3 ppt, 20 ppt, resp., significantly higher in individual cases). Only in the Mace Head spectra evidence was found for the presence of OIO. Since macroalgae under oxidative stress are suggested to be a further source for I 2 in the marine boundary layer, we re-analyzed spectra in the 500 – 600 nm range taken during the 1998 PARFORCE campaign in Mace Head, Ireland, which had not previously been analyzed for I 2. We identified molecular iodine above the detection limit (20 ppt), with peak mixing ratios of 61 ± 12 ppt. Since I 2 was undetectable during the Brittany campaign, we suggest that iodine may not be released into the atmosphere by macroalgae in general, but only by a special type of the <b>laminaria</b> <b>species</b> under oxidative stress. Only during periods of extraordinarily low water (spring-tide), the plant is exposed to ambient air and may release gaseous iodine in some way to the atmosphere. The results of our re-analysis of spectra from the PARFORCE campaign in 1998 support this theory. Hence, we feel that we can provide an explanation for the different I 2 levels in Brittany and Mace Head...|$|E
40|$|A diverse seaweed {{industry}} has developed in Ireland {{over the past}} few decades. The seaweed industry today comprises several sectors, such as biopolymers, agriculture/horticulture, cosmetics, thalassotherapy and human consumption, with the former two sectors being of most economic importance. Approximately sixteen seaweed species are commercially utilised, three of which are of particular commercial importance. These are the calcified red algae, referred to as maërl, which mainly comprises of two species (Phymatolithon calcareum and Lithothamnion corallioides) and are exploited by a single company for agricultural, horticultural, food and cosmetic applications. The other bulk species is the brown alga Ascophyllum nodosum, which is used for alginate extraction and agriculture/horticulture applications. The latter species sustains an industry, which {{is an important factor in}} contributing to the maintenance of coastal communities especially in rural areas of the west coast, particularly in the Gaeltacht of Connemara (Guiry 1997, National Seaweed Forum, 2000). Mechanical harvesting of seaweeds in Ireland is limited to the exploitation of maërl. At present, one company has a licence to harvest calcified algae in the south-west of Ireland (Bantry Bay) with 8, 000 - 10, 000 wet tonnes of maërl being extracted from the seabed annually in recent years. The supply of raw material for the Ascophyllum-processing industry as well as for the other industrial sectors relies on harvesters who harvest the seaweed by hand. Although hand-harvesting provides a source of employment in rural areas along the west coast, the age profile is increasing and the numbers of harvesters are declining due to insufficient recruitment of younger harvesters (National Seaweed Forum 2000; Kelly et al. 2001). With growing demands for seaweeds, it is uncertain whether hand-harvesting will provide sufficient raw material in the long-term. The National Seaweed Forum has evaluated the current state of the Irish Seaweed Industry. The forum was launched by the Minister for Marine and Natural Resources in 1999 and consists of 19 members from state agencies, third-level institutions and industry. In the final report (National Seaweed Forum, 2000) it was stated that the natural sustainable seaweed resources in Ireland are under-utilised and the industrial potential, including high-value applications, has not been fully realised. The National Seaweed Forum identified two key areas as being crucial to the development of the Irish seaweed industry: 1) Seaweed aquaculture was assumed to provide the most cost-effective method to meet growing market demand with high-quality seaweed for specific sectors such as human consumption, cosmetics and biotechnology. Additionally, a seaweed aquaculture industry is expected to create attractive and high-skilled jobs, especially in peripheral communities in coastal areas. This is based on the fact that seaweeds of interest to high quality applications are often not bulk species, which are easy to harvest in large amounts. Therefore, with cultivation you strongly increase volume/area, which facilitates harvesting and also standardises quality. Cultivation of a bulk species such as kelp is economically not feasible in Europe. 2) The development and introduction of harvesting machinery suitable for Irish conditions was thought to have a significant impact on the expansion of a viable Irish seaweed industry. As a measure to ensure long-term continuity of raw-material supply of bulk species (e. g. A. nodosum, <b>Laminaria</b> <b>species)</b> the investigation of mechanical harvesting techniques with emphasis on sustainability and environmental impact were prioritised as an R&D area (National Seaweed Forum, 2000). An initial comprehensive study of hand and mechanical harvesting of Ascophyllum nodosum, including an environmental impact assessment, was conducted in the late 1990 s (Kelly et al., 2001). In this study, a device similar to the Norwegian Ascophyllum cutter (a flat-bottomed boat fitted with a Vaughan vertical wet-well chopper pump) was used. When hand and mechanical harvesting were compared, there was no significant difference in environmental impact caused by the two methods, but mechanical harvesting was found to be less effective and more expensive than hand harvesting. At present, kelp species in Ireland such as L. digitata, L. saccharina and Alaria esculenta, are harvested by hand but only in small amounts. This means that the natural sustainable resources of kelps of Irish shores are under-utilised. Due to the economic importance of L. digitata and L. hyperborea for alginate extraction and the growing demand for kelp by the phycocolloid and other industries, the introduction of mechanical harvesting is currently being considered for Ireland. Mechanised harvesting enables the harvester to remove large amounts of biomass from an area in a relatively short time. It is therefore essential to develop a suitable management scheme to ensure sustainable exploitation of natural resources and continuous integrity of marine habitats. The objective of the present study is to provide an extensive literature review on kelp research, harvesting and resource management as essential background knowledge for the development of an appropriate management strategy for Ireland. The report addresses the following topics: • Biology of kelps • Biodiversity of kelp forests and ecological significance of kelps • Commercial kelp harvesting in France and Norway (methods, management and environmental impact) • Investigations of kelp in Ireland (Growth rates, biomass, biodiversity of kelp beds, regeneration potential, kelp resources) • Legal framework for seaweed harvesting in Ireland • Conclusions and recommendationsFunder: Marine Institut...|$|E

The influ-ence of depth, slope, terrain curvature, light exposure, wave exposure, and current speed on the distribution of L. hyperborea are modelled using a generalized additive model.

Lipid extracts were fractionated into neutral lipids, free fatty acids, and polar lipids, prior to derivatization and GC-MS analysis. A total of 42 fatty acids were identified and quantified, including the n- 3 fatty acids -linolenic acid, stearidonic acid, and eicosapentaenoic acid. The fatty acid amounts are higher in blade than in stipe (7. 42 [*]mg/g dry weight and 2. 57 [*]mg/g dry weight, resp.). The highest amounts of n- 3 fatty acids are found within the neutral lipid fractions with 590. 6 [*]ug/g dry weight and 100. 9 [*]ug/g dry weight for blade and stipe, respectively. The amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids are 3. 4 times higher in blade than stipe. The blade had the highest PUFA/SFA ratio compared to stipe (1. 02 versus 0. 76) and the lowest n- 6 /n- 3 ratio (0. 8 versus 3. 5). This study highlights the compositional differences between the lipid fractions of stipe and blade from L. hyperborea.

This study analyzed data from 38 subtidal rocky reef sites collected by a single diving team of marine biologists {{along the coast of}} Brittany from 2004 to 2010. At each site, the depth limits of the algal belts were determined between 0 and - 40 m Chart Datum (CD); the flora and fauna compositions and abundances were sampled at - 3 and - 8 m CD. A total of 364 taxa (156 flora and 208 fauna), belonging to 12 phyla, were identified. The results showed that the depth limit and density of kelp beds increased as water turbidity decreased; moreover, several changes in community structure could be related to water turbidity and temperature. Thus, northern and southern Brittany showed strong differences in diversity and structure of the dominant kelp <b>species</b> (<b>Laminaria</b> hyperborea and Saccorhiza polyschides).

40|$|Macroalgae (seaweeds) are a {{promising}} feedstock {{for the production}} of third generation bioethanol, since they have high carbohydrate contents, contain little or no lignin and are available in abundance. However, seaweeds typically contain a more diverse array of monomeric sugars than are commonly present in feedstocks derived from lignocellulosic material which are currently used for bioethanol production. Hence, identification of a suitable fermentative microorganism that can utilise the principal sugars released from the hydrolysis of macroalgae remains a major objective. The present study used a phenotypic microarray technique to screen 24 different yeast strains for their ability to metabolise individual monosaccharides commonly found in seaweeds, as well as hydrolysates following an acid pre-treatment of five native UK seaweed <b>species</b> (<b>Laminaria</b> digitata, Fucus serratus, Chondrus crispus, Palmaria palmata and Ulva lactuca). Five strains of yeast (three Saccharomyces spp, one Pichia sp and one Candida sp) were selected and subsequently evaluated for bioethanol production during fermentation of the hydrolysates. Four out of the five selected strains converted these monomeric sugars into bioethanol, with the highest ethanol yield (13 g L− 1) resulting from a fermentation using C. crispus hydrolysate with Saccharomyces cerevisiae YPS 128.

Kelp was chosen as an inexpensive and readily available biomass as it is common in shallow coastal waters in the northwestern Atlantic. Its bio sorption characteristics are compared to peat which is recognised for its bio sorptive properties L digitata was consequently used to treat tannery effluent. Untreated kelp outperformed peat and pre-treated kelp as a biosorbent Uptake of Cr(IIl) by L digitata at pH 4 was significantly higher (1 12 mmol/g biomass dry weight) than with other biomass as reported in the literature High uptake levels were also seen for Cr(VI) and copper.

Whole plants were incubated in an open box system made ofUV-transparent Perspex and exposed to solar radiation (> 295 nm), solar radiation excluding UVB (> 320 nm) and solar radiation excluding UVA + UVB (> 400 nm). Increasing radiation levels were simulated by transplantation of thepre-adapted algae from their growth depth at 2 m to a water depth of 1 m. Sensitivity to artificially increased UV radiation wasdetermined by exposure of algae from the three treatments to 6 h of strong UV radiation. P. palmata was relatively insensitive toincreasing UV radiation and recovered very fast and almost completely in 2 h.

The Arctic Ocean is going through an unprecedented change and the region has been getting warmer {{over the past few}} decades. Temperatures are forecast to increase at double the global rate during the 21 stcentury. Increasing temperatures and de-creasing sea ice might have a large impact on the Arctic ecosystem. Besides the common Arctic kelp Laminaria digitata, recent studies recorded the occurrence of Saccharina nigripes around Spitsbergen. The type <b>species</b> <b>Laminaria</b> digitata is involved in taxonomic confusion based on the great morphological plasticity varying with its environment. Mucilage duct channels are a taxonomic feature for the differentiation between the species. In this study, a combination of molecular and morpho-anatomical tools determines whether mucilage duct channels are a useful taxonomic character for species differentiation in the genera Saccharina and Laminaria. Microscopic examination and DNA-Barcoding determine the presence of Saccharina nigripes at Hansneset and the use of mucilage duct channels in the stipe are useful for species distinc-tion. Only kelps with present mucilage duct channels in the stipe could be taxonomically de-termined as Saccharina nigripes. Laminaria digitata and Saccharina latissima lacked mucilage duct channels in the stipe, also Saccharina nigripes individuals located in upper layers were lacking mucilage duct channels in the stipe. Saccharina nigripes are mostly abundant at in the deeper layers, whereas Laminaria digitata in 2. 5 m depth at Hansneset. Below water level, Saccharina nigripes (n= 4) individuals were genetically identified. Furthermore, the proportion of mucilage duct channels in stipe of Saccharina nigripes increases significantly with depth...|$|R

Whole plants were incubated in an open box system made of UV-transparent Perspex and exposed to solar radiation (lambda > 295 nm), solar radiation excluding UVB (lambda > 320 nm) and solar radiation excluding UVA + UVB (lambda > 400 nm). Increasing radiation levels were simulated by transplantation of the pre-adapted algae from their growth depth at 2 m to a water depth of 1 m. Sensitivity to artificially increased UV radiation was determined by exposure of algae from the three treatments to 6 h of strong UV radiation. P. palmata was relatively insensitive to increasing UV radiation and recovered very fast and almost completely in 2 h. Even plants pre- cultured in ambient radiation levels excluding UVA + UVB or UVB only showed no photoinhibition after exposure to extra UV radiation in the laboratory. L. saccharina was, in comparison to P. palmata, more sensitive and showed photoinhibition under solar radiation and solar minus UVB radiation after transplantation from 2 to Im water depth.

40|$|International audienceThe {{photosynthetic}} activity and productivity of four dominant canopy intertidal macroalgae were measured under emersion and immersion, at saturating light levels (PAR > 300 μmol photons m− 2 s− 1), and compared at two sites (eastern and western English Channel) {{in spring and}} summer. The {{photosynthetic activity}} of thalli {{was measured by the}} electron transport rate (ETR) using pulse-amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorescence and the productivity of individuals and of communities was measured by carbon fluxes in closed chambers. Under emersion, when thalli were still hydrated, the uppermost species Pelvetia canaliculata had higher photosynthetic activity (mean ETR between 327 and 460 μmol e− m− 2 s− 1) and individual gross productivity (between 60 and 212 μmol C gDW− 1 h− 1) than the lowermost <b>species</b> <b>Laminaria</b> digitata (mean ETR between 24 and 53 μmol e− m− 2 s− 1 and gross productivity between 2 and 38 μmol C gDW− 1 h− 1), whatever the site and season. P. canaliculata had higher ETR in air than underwater (averaged 146 μmol e− m− 2 s− 1) and L. digitata had lower ETR in air than underwater (averaged 112 μmol e− m− 2 s− 1), while they exhibited respectively 3 and 5 times higher gross productivity underwater. At the community scale, the low mid-shore zone of Fucus serratus had the highest mean gross productivity under emersion (47 mmol C m− 2 h− 1) while rates were higher for the uppermost than lowermost zone at the eastern site (average 20 and 6 mmol C m− 2 h− 1 respectively) and of the same order of magnitude for both zones at the western site (about 30 mmol C m− 2 h− 1).

A warming trend was established and native species identified with the possible addition of what has been thought of up to now as a range extension <b>species,</b> <b>Laminaria</b> ochroleuca. Composition changes over time using the MNCR data proved to be inconclusive although a relationship between depth and year had been shown to be significant while the Marclim database showed increases in the Lusitanian species L. ochroleuca, Primary intertidal and subtidal surveys were conducted at five sites around Plymouth Sound to look at the current {{composition of}} kelp and the effect of changes to related biodiversity was analysed through epibiont analysis of kelp holdfasts from the six commonly competing kelp species found within two sites of Plymouth Sound. The surveys found shore height to show significant differences in community composition and that subtidal conditions were seen to be more affect by the invasive species U. pinnatifida. as well as extensive numbers of Lusitanian species. Depth was also found be to a confounding effect on species composition, although this varied greatly between sites. Epibiont species were found to show significance between kelp species but not site and no relationship was found between epibiont diversity and habitat volume, although this was considered due to low sample size. Preferred colonisation conditions for the invasive Japanese species Undaria pinnatifida was also investigated on the shores of Torbay, UK.

40|$|Our interdisciplinary, {{long-term}} {{project on}} Arctic benthic macroalgae revealed considerable change of shallow water benthic ecosystems {{as a consequence}} of environmental changes. At our Arctic study site at Hansneset, Kongsfjorden, Svalbard, we repeated a quantitative diving study of 1996 / 98 in 2012 - 2014 in the shallow rocky sublittoral from 0 - 15 m depth. The overall seaweed biomass had increased 1. 7 × and 4. 7 × at shallow depths (2. 5 m), which supported predictions of increased productivity in the Arctic because of climate warming. The standing stock at the biomass maximum at 2. 5 m comprised 14. 4 kg fresh biomass m- 2, a leaf area index (leaf area/sampling area) of approx. 10 and a very high kelp density. Here, the kelp composition included four species, with pronounced dominance of digitate kelp <b>species</b> (<b>Laminaria</b> digitata and/or Saccharina nigripes). Our study showed 1) uplift of kelp biomass maximum from 5 m to 2. 5 m depth, 2) decrease in the lower depth limit of dominant brown algae by several m, 3) decrease in biomass of annual species, 4) considerable increase in richness from 20 to 45 species in the intertidal to shallow sublittoral (1 m depth). With respect to the associated fauna, both biomass and production increased, particularly in the shallow sublittoral (2. 5 - 5 m), and a functional change towards the dominance of suspension feeders became apparent. These observed changes are likely a consequence of recent Arctic warming. Lack of landfast sea ice and ice-scouring during winter would reduce physical abrasion and improve irradiance conditions. However, in summer increased sedimentation with reduced phases of clear water conditions has the opposite effect by reducing the radiance and causing less light to reach the deepest part of the kelp beds. Sedimentation had revealed a negative impact on germination and formation of juvenile kelp sporophytes. Moderate grazing could partly counteract the negative effect of sedimentation but not under complete sediment coverage of the recruits (~ 1 mm thickness). Arctic warming, with increased temperature, less sea ice, but increased sedimentation may cause species-specific differences in sporophyte recruitment, which may lead to “winner” and “looser” species in the kelp forest in Svalbard...|$|R
40|$|An ever {{expanding}} {{global population}} has {{lead to increased}} pressure on available land for food production. Thoughts are turning to the large expanses of space and resources available in the sea, in particular offshore areas. Macroalgae are an ideal solution due to their productivity, high nutritional value and use as a dietary protein substitute. This {{research has been conducted}} with Deltares and as a component of the MERMAID European Union initiative which aims to incorporate aquaculture into their designs for multi functional offshore platforms. This research aimed to determine the biological feasibility of an offshore macroalgal farm in the North Sea. To do so, we therefore assumed that macroalgae cultivated offshore would respond in a similar manner as when cultivated nearshore. Two <b>species,</b> <b>Laminaria</b> digitata and Saccharina latissima were studied in nine selected sites in the North Sea in monoculture and polyculture scenarios. These sites represented characteristic offshore areas of the North Sea and aquaculture sites in planning. The suitability of sites and the controlling factors to growth were studied with the generic integrated ecosystem model Delft 3 D. Results indicate offshore aquaculture systems to be biologically feasible based on macroalgal farming in the North Sea. L. digitata produced the largest biomass when grown in a monoculture and in a polyculture with an increase in total biomass production being observed in the polyculture scenario. The site that produced the largest biomass was Borssele which had one of the highest current velocities observed. A positive trend was found between current velocity, seawater temperature and maximum biomass produced. A relationship was found between the concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and phosphorous (DIP) throughout the year and the biomass produced at each site. The sites which produced the most biomass had a simultaneous increase in DIN, DIP and biomass between July and October. Therefore this research recommends that in order to achieve maximum biomass production, L. digitata and S. latissima should be grown in a polyculture. The current velocity, DIN and DIP concentrations and seawater temperature were found to be the main controlling factors to biomass production and should be considered when selecting a suitable offshore macroalgal site. This model {{can be used as a}} starting point to which additional modifications and data from test sites when available can be implemented into in order to bridge the gap between model output and reality. Despite this research concluding that it is biologically feasible for an offshore macroalgal farm, the feasibility of other aspects such as economic and social must also be accessed...|$|R
40|$|Is the sea {{near your}} farm? Why not embark on sea farming {{or as the}} {{cultivation}} of seaweeds is called mariculture. The virtues of seaweeds have been known for ages {{but only in the}} past few decades have both production and consumption started to soar. The various edible brown, green and red seaweeds they are grouped according to colour, which is determined by light availability are not only gaining in popularity as a vegetable, they are increasingly being used industrially to give a smoother texture to such products such as ice-cream, beer, jam, paper, rubber, toothpaste, ointments and lipstick. Some, particularly the well-known Spirulina species, are also used for their medicinal properties. Of the three groups, brown seaweeds are most common and most widely produced. According to the FAO, world production rose in the 1990 s by almost 100 % to almost 7, 000, 000 million t (fresh weight) today annually. China, with an annual 4, 000, 000 million t, is by far the largest producer, followed at a distance by other Asian countries such as Japan, Korea and the Philippines. In the Pacific seaweed production is a well-established business too. Africa is a relative newcomer, although Tanzania and Madagascar have been exporting red seaweeds (Eucheuma species) for years for carrageenans (the source of an infinite variety of gels). On the island of Zanzibar sea farming was established a decade ago. Here it has become primarily a woman s task. The weeds are usually grown on strings between poles just beneath the water surface. It takes some weeks before it can be harvested, after which it is dried and sold. The prices for industrial seaweeds in Zanzibar are currently low, but they nevertheless enable the women to earn more money than their husbands do from fishing and growing crops. Africa could make much more use of the resource. Keto Mshigeni of the University of Namibia argues in Discovery and Innovation (the African Academy of Sciences journal), that seaweeds could be used to extract iodine. An estimated 150 million Africans suffer from iodine deficiencies and currently all the iodide for adding iodine to salt has to be imported, and yet on the shores of southern Africa are seaweeds such as <b>Laminaria</b> and Ecklonia <b>species</b> which contain about 6, 000 mg of iodine per kilo weed. Another added-value possibility was discovered by the Taurus Products company in Namibia, which developed Agrikelp, a seaweed-based soil improver. A substance in the weeds absorbs and stores water, releasing it very slowly. When added to the soil, it improves the soil s water-holding capacity and retards wilting. What s new, people on the Celtic fringes of Europe, in Britanny and Wales, may ask? There kelp has been added to soil for thousands of years, as well as being used in the baking of bread.

40|$|Although it is {{recognized}} that coastal macroalgae communities are as productive {{as the most}} productive terrestrial systems, few investigations of primary production of kelp forests were performed worldwide over an entire season. In the present study, a prototype primary production model was developed and first estimations of the summer primary production between July and early September of the dominant kelp <b>species</b> <b>Laminaria</b> hyperborea (Laminariales) in the sublittoral off the island of Helgoland (North Sea) were derived. The development of the model involved two steps: (1) an estimation of the basic ex situ net primary production capacity and (2) an estimation of the realized in situ summer net oxygen production, both along the depth gradient of L. hyperborea. For step (1) the photosynthetic characteristics of L. hyperborea were derived from ex situ photosynthesis irradiance (PE) measurements following the concept of Jassby and Platt (1986) which were correlated with continuous underwater irradiance data taken over seven weeks at four depth levels. For step (2) the in situ summer net oxygen production per unit seafloor along the depth gradient was derived by multiplying the basic leaf area based net production estimated in step (1) with in situ leaf area data of L. hyperborea given in Gehling (2006) and Pehlke and Bartsch (2008). Due to the occurrence of L. hyperborea {{in most of the}} photic sublittoral zone and the high level of thallus differentiation, measurement of photosynthetic activity and Chlorophyll a (Chl a) content was performed with individuals from different depths (0. 5 m, 2 m, 4 m, 6 m MLWS) and with algal blade from different regions of the blade (5, 25 and 50 cm above the stipe-blade transition zone). The photosynthetic characteristics maximal photosynthetic rate (Pmax), photosynthetic efficiency at low light intensities (alpha), light saturation point (Ek), dark respiration as well Chl a content of L. hyperborea showed no significant depth-dependent variation and thus, no acclimation to decreasing underwater irradiance with increasing depth. A mean Pmax of 3. 3 μmol O 2 cm- 2 h- 1 (17. 6 μmol O 2 g- 1 h- 1) and a mean Ek of 70 μmol photons m- 2 s- 1 was determined at all depths. Only the light compensation point (Ec) was significantly lower in L. hyperborea from 2 m depth (MLWS) (6 μmol photons m- 2 s- 1) than in individuals from 4 m (MLWS) (11 μmol m- 2 s- 1). While, Pmax, dark respiration and alpha increased from the basal to the distal part of the blade when normalized to unit fresh weight, normalization to unit leaf area showed no variation of photosynthetic parameters along the blade. Thus, photosynthetic activity of blade segments from the intermediate region normalized to leaf area should be representative for the photosynthetic performance of the entire blade. Dry weight based Chl a content also increases significantly with almost twice as high concentrations in the distal region (1. 98 mg Chl a g- 1 DW) than in the meristematic region (1. 02 mg Chl a g- 1 DW). Chlorophyll a content based on leaf area was, however, highest in the meristematic region (0. 014 mg Chl a cm- 2) with a significantly decreasing Chl a content towards the distal region of the blade (0. 009 mg Chl a cm- 2). Pmax, alpha and dark respiration normalized to leaf area of L. hyperborea blade segments from the intermediate region were used in the further estimations of productivity along the depth gradient. The estimated basic ex situ and realized in situ leaf area based summer net oxygen production of L. hyperborea along the depth gradient showed slightly contrasting results. The ex situ net oxygen production (step 1) was highest in individuals from 0. 5 m and 2 m depth (MLWS) with maximum mean daily values of 33 μmol O 2 cm- 2 d- 1 in late July. Productivity of L. hyperborea from 4 m depth (MLWS) was slightly but insignificantly lower (26. 2 μmol O 2 cm- 2 d- 1). Only the net oxygen production of individuals from 6 m (MLWS) was significantly lower over all seven weeks and even became negative in mid-August. This was due to a generally decline of oxygen productivity by 80 – 90...|$|R
