5000|$|Kim Yujin’s {{early works}} contain apocalyptic {{imagination}}. The apocalypse {{is based on}} artistic imagination that bemoans the brevity of daily life, attempts {{to figure out a}} path of transcendence, or arrange the probability for recombination. Kim Yujin’s apocalypse leads to exploration on the feminine world. For instance, in “Eojae” (어제 Yesterday), she portrayed the story of women who attempts to escape the life in an anchored <b>laundry</b> <b>boat</b> and go into an unknown future. In “The Mark of the Wolf” (늑대의 문장) and “The Witch” (마녀), she tells a story of girls who leave civilization in favor of primitive times, and a story of beings that travels beyond the world of death.|$|E

In 1918 Francis Carco felt the painter needed to widen his horizons and sent him to Dieppe {{to stay in a}} house which Carco rented on a yearly basis. Soon all the wealth of the sea-coast scenes {{appeared}} on Maclet’s canvases. He spent a year in Dieppe and then returned to Montmartre and to his former subjects. Montmartre was changing, new apartment buildings were going up, taking the place of the stretches of verdures; the Ourcq Canal would soon disappear, the last of the <b>laundry</b> <b>boats</b> were slowly gliding down the Seine. With his palette and brush and knife, Maclet seized them all and immortalized them.|$|R

Two men survive, one villager and a mysterious Chinese stranger named Yen Sin (Chaney). Being Chinese and refusing to take part in Christian service for those lost, he is made an outcast and forced to live on a small boat in the harbor. He makes his living doing <b>laundry</b> from his <b>boat,</b> and is soon greeted by the new minister, John Malden (Ford), who tries unsuccessfully to convert him. Love blossoms between Reverend Malden and Sympathy, and they are soon married, to the chagrin of the wealthiest member of the village, Nate Snow (St. Polis). Sympathy soon befriends Yen Sin after she observes several kids taunting him in the street.|$|R
