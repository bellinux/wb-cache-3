5|$|The {{imperial}} pheasant {{is a rare}} bird found in the forests of Vietnam and Laos. Rasmussen and her co-workers used morphology, hybridisation experiments, and DNA analysis to show that this pheasant, previously thought critically endangered, is actually a naturally occurring hybrid between the Vietnamese pheasant <b>Lophura</b> <b>hatinhensis</b> and the subspecies annamensis of the silver pheasant L. nycthemera.|$|E
25|$|Of the 59 {{recorded}} reptile and amphibian species, 18 {{are listed}} in Vietnam's Red Data Book and 6 {{are listed in}} the IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals. Further research has increased the species numbers markedly, and the number of recorded amphibian species is now 50 and that of reptile species 101. The 72 fish species include 4 species endemic to the area, including Danio quangbinhensis. The park is home to over 200 bird species, inclusive of several rare birds such as: chestnut-necklaced partridge, red-collared woodpecker, brown hornbill, sooty babbler and short-tailed scimitar babbler. There is good evidence for the Vietnamese pheasant (<b>Lophura</b> <b>hatinhensis)</b> and imperial pheasant (Lophura imperialis) species at Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng area. An initiative survey conducted by Russian and Vietnamese scientists from Vietnam-Russia Tropical Centre (funded by WWF) recorded 259 butterfly species of 11 families. Almost all major butterfly taxa in Vietnam can be found in Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng park.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lophura</b> <b>hatinhensis</b> and Lophura hoogerwerfi are {{sometimes}} considered subspecies, leaving this genus with only 10 species. Other subspecies are also sometimes considered distinct species.|$|E

50|$|The Vietnamese pheasant, or Vietnam fireback, was {{formerly}} considered {{a species of}} gallopheasant, <b>Lophura</b> <b>hatinhensis,</b> but is now considered a variant of Edward's pheasant. Discovered in 1964, it is endemic to central Vietnam. Its range concentrates around Kẻ Gỗ Nature Reserve in Hà Tĩnh Province.|$|E

50|$|Kẻ Gỗ Nature Reserve is {{a nature}} reserve in Vietnam. It {{is located in}} three districts of this province, namely: Cẩm Xuyên, Thạch Hà, Hương Khê. It was {{established}} by the Decision No. 519/QD-UB dated May 3, 1997 of the Ha Tinh People's Committee. The purpose of this establishment {{is to protect the}} endangered Vietnamese pheasant (<b>Lophura</b> <b>hatinhensis)</b> and the imperial pheasant (Lophura imperialis) as well as biodiversity in the southern area of this province. In this area, there exists nearly 100 species of amphibians and reptiles as shown by the German biologist Dr. Thomas Ziegler. Large mammals are rare, due to the high hunting pressure. So there is probably no more elephants. Ke Go is home to one of the last lowland rainforests of Vietnam. The management board includes about 70 persons, inclusive of 56 rangers. Illegal loggings, poaching and exploitation of oil threaten this habitat. The Netherlands and ORO-VERDE financially supported a project for the conservation of the reserve.|$|E
