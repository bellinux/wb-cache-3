When the logarithm of a random variable has a normal distribution, the variable {{is said to}} have a <b>log-normal</b> <b>distribution.</b> Log-normal distributions are encountered in many fields, wherever a variable is formed as the product of many independent positive random variables, for example in the study of turbulence.|$|E

The performance of the proposed methods is assessed through simulation studies that show that the modified signed log-likelihood ratio statistic is nearly an exact approach even for very small samples. The methods are also applied to two real-life examples...|$|R

40|$|Internet memes are {{phenomena}} that rapidly gain popularity or notoriety on the Internet. Often, modifications or spoofs {{add to the}} profile of the original idea thus turning it into a phenomenon that transgresses social and cultural boundaries. It is commonly assumed that Internet memes spread virally but scientific evidence as to this assumption is scarce. In this paper, we address this issue and investigate the epidemic dynamics of 150 famous Internet memes. Our analysis is based on time series data that were collected from Google Insights, Delicious, Digg, and StumbleUpon. We find that differential equation models from mathematical epidemiology as well as simple <b>log-normal</b> <b>distributions</b> give a good account of the growth and decline of memes. We discuss the role of <b>log-normal</b> <b>distributions</b> in modeling Internet phenomena and touch on practical implications of our findings...|$|R

Until now, however, limited data resolution and coverage have hindered a coherent description of human displacements across different spatial and temporal scales. Here, we characterise mobility behaviour across several orders of magnitude by analysing ~ 850 individuals' digital traces sampled every ~ 16 seconds for 25 months with ~ 10 meters spatial resolution. We show that the distributions of distances and waiting times between consecutive locations are best described by <b>log-normal</b> <b>distributions</b> and that natural time-scales emerge from the regularity of human mobility. We point out that <b>log-normal</b> <b>distributions</b> also characterise the patterns of discovery of new places, implying {{that they are not}} a simple consequence of the routine of modern life...|$|R

Also, only a <b>log-normal</b> <b>distribution</b> can compensate for the inability of almost all biological parameters to be of negative numbers (at least when measured on absolute scales), with the consequence that there is no definite limit to the size of outliers (extreme values) on the high side, but, on the other hand, they can never be less than zero, resulting in a positive skewness.|$|E
