2500|$|The tooling {{used for}} thread milling can be solid or indexable. For {{internal}} threads, solid cutters are generally limited to holes larger than , and indexable internal thread cutting tools {{are limited to}} holes larger than [...] The advantage {{is that when the}} insert wears out it is easily and more cost effectively replaced. The disadvantage is the cycle time is generally longer than solid tools. Note that solid multiple-form thread cutting tools look similar to taps, but they differ in that the cutting tool does not have a backtaper and there is not a <b>lead-in</b> <b>chamfer.</b> This lack of a <b>lead-in</b> <b>chamfer</b> allows the threads to be formed within one pitch length of the bottom of a blind hole.|$|E
40|$|In {{the field}} of {{robotics}} and automatic assembly tooling, it is often necessary to provide some compliance when fitting two parts together or when engaging a tool with a complementarily shaped aperture. This need arises because of the tolerances in gripping and positioning capability of a robot arm and the dimensional tolerances of the members being positioned. The use of excessive force to engage two imperfectly aligned members can lead to damage to the members or assembly tooling. A remote centre compliance (RCC) is a device that can provide a compliance center projected outward from the device. Remote compliance centers decouple lateral and angular motion. A RCC device {{can be used in}} assembly to ease the insertion force. When a project compliance center is near the insertion point of a peg-in-hole type assembly, the peg translates into the hole when it strikes the outside <b>lead-in</b> <b>chamfer</b> without rotating. This translation without rotation prevents the jamming and galling seen from compliance devices that have a compliance center far away from the insertion point. The proposed work aims at designing and developing an intelligent RCC device which helps the parts assemble even if there are misalignments of known limits and is capable of capturing useful information for the assembly process...|$|E
40|$|Pallets of {{automatic}} transfer lines {{serve as the}} technological and work-transfer equipment. However, their design {{is based on the}} general principles of designing machine accessories. Calculation of the basic design parameters of work based on their functioning features is fairly relevant. In pallet transfer movement over work positioning there is a mismatch between axes of the basic bushing of a pallet and the clamping locks of positioning. The paper identifies the factors influencing it, and defines the conditions to ensure the trouble-free clamping lock. The circular and rhombic clamping of pallet is simultaneous. Further, a clamping load is calculated from the pallet mass (together with the work-piece) and the geometric parameters of the pallet clamping. The paper reveals three movement stages of the clamping lock in a vertical plane when setting the pallet in work positioning: - a clamping lock free play till it encounters with the location bushing; - a clamping lock play length when the <b>lead-in</b> <b>chamfer</b> contacts the bushing chamfer; - a clamping lock play length over the circular surface of bushing. The study of this process has allowed us to calculate the time of pallet clamping and dynamic loads acting on the clamping lock. These calculations made it possible to calculate the required diameter of the clamping lock. The presented calculations allow a reasonable assigning the main design parameters of work positioning for the pallet automatic lines. </p...|$|E
