Shortest Path Bridging virtual {{local area network}} {{identifier}} (VLAN ID) or Shortest Path Bridging VID or (SPBV) provides capability that is backwards compatible with spanning tree technologies. Shortest Path Bridging Media Access Control (MAC) or (SPBM), (previously known as Provider Backbone Bridge SPBB) provides additional values which capitalize on Provider Backbone Bridge (PBB) capabilities. SPB (the generic term for both) combines an Ethernet data path (either IEEE 802.1Q in the case of SPBV, or Provider Backbone Bridges (PBBs) IEEE 802.1ah in the case of SPBM) with an IS-IS <b>link</b> <b>state</b> <b>control</b> protocol running between Shortest Path bridges (network-to-network interface (NNI) <b>links).</b> The <b>link</b> <b>state</b> protocol is used to discover and advertise the network topology and compute shortest path trees (SPT) from all bridges in the SPT Region.|$|R

40|$|Several {{methods have}} {{recently}} been proposed to improve <b>link</b> <b>state</b> protocol efficiency within wireless ad hoc networks. One class of approaches targets the reduction of <b>link</b> <b>state</b> <b>control</b> overhead that contributes to networkwide broadcast storms, therefore enhancing protocol scalability. We have implemented and studied two such methods and demonstrate and discuss their relative performance characteristics. We present early simulation analysis {{over a number of}} scalability factors, including average nodal density and network diameter (maximum path length). Based upon initial results, we demonstrate that the two approaches to <b>link</b> <b>state</b> overhead reduction are somewhat complementary and that they provide additional benefit when applied together in many topologies studied. While both approaches are valid scalable flooding techniques, we discuss further the relative merits and potential disadvantages of each technique. BACKGROUND There has been recent interest in improving the scalability and operation of <b>link</b> <b>state</b> routing mechanisms in wireless ad hoc networks [CM 99]. While applying a hierarchy can reduce protocol overhead through state aggregation, several methods recently proposed reduce classical <b>link</b> <b>state</b> overhead requirements without hierarchies. Classical flooding techniques often used for distributing <b>link</b> <b>state</b> amongst the network nodes contribute significant protocol overhead and traffic congestion as the network scales, especially when applied in wireless networks [SRS 02]. We define classical flooding to be the case in which each node throughout the network rebroadcasts the data packet once and only once. In recent years, more routing control flooding improvements for mobile ad hoc networks (manet) have been proposed and there has been some evaluation of their relative merits [HXG 02]. We have chosen to model and analyze some detailed scalability aspects of two recent innovative approaches that address problem of <b>link</b> <b>state</b> flooding in different ways. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate two such methods used to reduce control flooding overhead for <b>link</b> <b>state</b> algorithms. Th...|$|R

50|$|Both SPBV and SPBM {{inherit the}} rapid {{convergence}} of a <b>link</b> <b>state</b> <b>control</b> plane. A special attribute of SPBM {{is its ability}} to rebuild multicast trees in a similar time to unicast convergence, because it substitutes computation for signaling. When an SPBM bridge has performed the computations on a topology database, it knows whether it is on the shortest path between a root and one or more leaves of the SPT and can install state accordingly. Convergence is not gated by incremental discovery of a bridge’s place on a multicast tree by the use of separate signaling transactions. However, SPBM on a node does not operate completely independently of its peers, and enforces agreement on the current network topology with its peers. This very efficient mechanism uses exchange of a single digest of <b>link</b> <b>state</b> covering the entire network view, and does not need agreement on each path to each root individually. The result is that the volume of messaging exchanged to converge the network is in proportion to the incremental change in topology and not the number of multicast trees in the network. A simple link event that may change many trees is communicated by signaling the link event only; the consequent tree construction is performed by local computation at each node. The addition of a single service access point to a service instance involves only the announcement of the I-SID, regardless of the number of trees. Similarly the removal of a bridge, which might involve the rebuilding of hundreds to thousands of trees, is signaled only with a few <b>link</b> <b>state</b> updates.|$|R
40|$|The {{nonlinear}} stochastic control problem {{related with}} flow control is considered.

The aim of the control is to achieve the maximum of some utility function taking into account the losses of transmitted information. Originally the problem belongs to a class of stochastic control with incomplete information, however, the optimal filtering equations giving the estimation of the current <b>link</b> <b>state</b> based on the observation of the loss process give the opportunity to reduce the problem to the standard stochastic control problem with full observations. Then, a necessary optimality condition is derived in the form of stochastic maximum principle which allows us to obtain explicit analytic expressions for the optimal control in some particular cases. The optimal and suboptimal controls are investigated and compared with the flow control schemes which is used in TCP/IP networks. In particular, the optimal control demonstrates a much smoother behavior than the currently used TCP/IP congestion control...|$|R

The protocol is an optimization {{of the classical}} <b>link</b> <b>state</b> algorithm tailored {{to the requirements of}} a mobile wireless LAN. The key concept used in the protocol is that of multipoint relays (MPRs). MPRs are selected nodes which forward broadcast messages during the flooding process. This technique substantially reduces the message overhead as compared to a classical flooding mechanism, where every node retransmits each message when it receives the first copy of the message. In OLSR, <b>link</b> <b>state</b> information is generated only by nodes elected as MPRs. Thus, a second optimization is achieved by minimizing the number of control messages flooded in the network. As a third optimization, an MPR node may chose to report only links between itself and its MPR selectors. Hence, as contrary to the classic <b>link</b> <b>state</b> algorithm, partial <b>link</b> <b>state</b> information is distributed in the network. This information is then used for route calculation.
