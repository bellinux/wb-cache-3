40|$|The virion host shutoff (vhs) protein of {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 causes the {{degradation}} of host and viral mRNA immediately upon infection of permissive cells. vhs can interact with VP 16 through a 20 -amino-acid binding domain, and viruses containing a deletion of this VP 16 -binding domain of vhs (Δ 20) and a corresponding marker rescue (Δ 20 R) were constructed and characterized. Transient-transfection assays showed that this domain was dispensable for vhs activity. The Δ 20 recombinant virus, however, was unable to induce mRNA degradation {{in the presence of}} actinomycin D, while degradation induced by Δ 20 R was equivalent to that for wild-type virus. Δ 20, Δ 20 R, and KOS caused comparable RNA degradation in the absence of actinomycin D. Western blot analysis of infected cells indicated that comparable levels of vhs were expressed by Δ 20, Δ 20 R, and KOS, and there was only a modest reduction of vhs packaging in Δ 20. Immunoprecipitation of protein from cells infected with Δ 20 and Δ 20 R showed equivalent coprecipitation of vhs and VP 16. Pathogenesis studies with Δ 20 showed a significant decrease in replication in the corneas, trigeminal ganglia, and brains, as well as a significant reduction in clinical disease and <b>lethality,</b> <b>but</b> no <b>significant</b> difference in the establishment of, or reactivation from, latency compared to results with KOS and Δ 20 R. These results suggest that the previously described VP 16 -binding domain is not required for vhs packaging or for binding to VP 16. It is required, however, for RNA degradation activity of tegument-derived vhs and wild-type replication and virulence in mice...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe tested whether {{proteins}} {{implicated in}} Huntington's and other polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion diseases can cause axonal transport defects. Reduction of Drosophila huntingtin and expression of proteins containing pathogenic polyQ repeats disrupt axonal transport. Pathogenic polyQ proteins accumulate in axonal and nuclear inclusions, titrate soluble motor proteins, and cause neuronal apoptosis and organismal death. Expression of a cytoplasmic polyQ repeat protein causes adult retinal degeneration, axonal blockages in larval neurons, and larval <b>lethality,</b> <b>but</b> not neuronal apoptosis or nuclear inclusions. A nuclear polyQ repeat protein induces neuronal apoptosis and larval <b>lethality</b> <b>but</b> no axonal blockages. We suggest that pathogenic polyQ proteins cause neuronal dysfunction and organismal death by two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms. One mechanism requires nuclear accumulation and induces apoptosis; the other interferes with axonal transport. Thus, disruption of axonal transport by pathogenic polyQ proteins {{could contribute to}} early neuropathology in Huntington's and other polyQ expansion diseases...|$|R

Studies on CUP- 5, the human orthologue of h-mucolipin- 1 in Caenorhabditis elegans, have shown that these proteins are required for lysosome biogenesis. We show here that the lethality in cup- 5 mutant worms is due to two defects, starvation of embryonic cells and general developmental defects. Starvation leads to apoptosis through a CED- 3 -mediated pathway. We also show that providing worms with a lipid-soluble metabolite partially rescues the embryonic <b>lethality</b> <b>but</b> {{has no effect on}} the developmental defects, the major cause of the lethality.

The major HS protein (HSP) is the 72 kDa HSP 70 with strong homology in different eukaryotic species.

HS prevents high production of interleukin- 6 and nitric oxide and reduces severe damage and apoptosis of the enterocytes in the bowel. Mice deficient in the inducible hsp 70. 1 gene were no longer protected by HS treatment.

Treatment of these subpopulations with novobiocin (NOVO), a putative inhibitor of the mammalian topoisomerase II enzyme, revealed a unique cell cycle phase-dependent cytotoxicity for this agent.

Additionally, S and (. M phase cells progressed through the cell cycle relatively unaffected by NOVO but were blocked at the d-S boundary.

We also show that the terminal phenotype underlying the synthetic lethal network around PKC 1 is not uniform. Synthetic lethal genetic networks thus appear to be very heterogeneous in nature with important implications for what functional relationships can be discovered from them...|$|R

Provision of Foxp 3 -sufficient conventional T cells with nTreg cells reconstituted the iTreg pool and established tolerance. In turn, acute depletion of iTreg cells in rescued mice resulted in weight loss and inflammation. Whereas the transcriptional signatures of nTreg and in vivo-derived iTreg cells were closely matched, there was minimal overlap in their T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires. Thus, iTreg cells are an essential nonredundant regulatory subset that supplements nTreg cells, in part by expanding TCR diversity within regulatory responses...|$|R
