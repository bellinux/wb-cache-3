25|$|Obviously {{it was one}} {{of those}} things that {{reinforce}} that I can't have alcohol. I got away from the one thing that kept me on the straight and narrow and that was my relationship with the Lord. That should always come first. Hopefully some good will come out of this. It just crossed my mind that night, 'Can I have a drink?' Obviously I can't and this reinforces that. Since that night, I have not had another thought <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> know it's something I shouldn't do because it leads to other things.|$|E
25|$|The way {{our studio}} {{operated}} was {{that anything that}} comes in – there’s no value judgments made about the music. We just record it. Still, {{one of the things}} that I guess was cool about being a staff engineer is that I wouldn’t have sought out a band <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> wasn’t philosophically into anything that they were doing, but they were all good musicians – you would have to be to stay together at the speeds they were playing at. So there was that aspect of it, and just the whole pushing the envelope thing. It sounds like it’s just gonna completely break apart going 700 miles through the sky and then all of a sudden everything just comes right together again.|$|E

500|$|As the Japanese {{advanced}} in the South West Pacific during early 1942, the RAAF hurriedly established three new fighter units for Australia's northern defence, Nos.75, 76 and 77 Squadrons. Arthur was posted to No. 76 Squadron in April, flying P-40 Kittyhawks in New Guinea. His brother Norman {{was killed in}} action on 9 November 1942 while serving with the 2/31st Infantry Battalion in Papua. Promoted to squadron leader, in February 1943 Wilf succeeded Les Jackson as commanding officer of No.75 Squadron, based at Milne Bay {{under the control of}} No.9 Operational Group RAAF. [...] Arthur developed a reputation for diligence, courtesy, and concern for the welfare of his men. Despite the fact that, at 23, he was the youngest officer in his new squadron, he commanded the respect of his fellows because, he believed, [...] "they <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> work hard; they <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am not frightened of anything (i.e. Pretends not to be) and above those, they <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't boast". Having shot down a Mitsubishi G4M [...] "Betty" [...] bomber on 10March, Arthur was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his [...] "gallantry, matchless leadership and devotion to duty" [...] on 14April 1943. On this occasion, in spite of his guns jamming, he led 34 Allied aircraft, including Kittyhawks of Nos.75 and 77Squadrons and P-38 Lightnings of the USAAF, in [...] "a determined head-on attack" [...] to intercept 100 Japanese raiders, 14 of which were destroyed by the defenders. Arthur described the situation of being in combat but unable to shoot as [...] "sort of awkward. Fortunately nobody else would know except me." [...] To compensate for his lack of offensive weaponry, he repeatedly made as though attempting to ram one of the raiders, to try and force it down into the sea.|$|E

He declined the royal honour of Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2000, and turned down a knighthood in 2003. Bowie later stated [...] "I would never have any intention of accepting anything <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> seriously don't know what it's for.

[...] About her admiration for Clarkson, Lovato says, [...] "I just thought she was a great role model. She was never publicly seen drinking and driving or wearing really scandalous clothes or anything <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> feel like she set a really great example and she was extremely talented."

500|$|Doody and Kirshen {{describe}} {{the show as}} [...] "writing-heavy". Doody {{said in an interview}} with the British Comedy Guide: [...] "Compared to most radio shows, it's incredibly dense, material-wise, and very fast-moving. I think Matt and I would like some of it to be even faster, but sometimes people who've heard the pilot say things like, [...] "It's almost too much." [...] I really <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> like that it's something you kind of need to hear twice to catch everything. When we got the series, I honestly didn't know where we'd come up with the material of the quality we were determined to keep up." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{pilot and}} the rest of the series {{features}} the [...] "sky flowers" [...] as the main background.

[...] Since the show was influenced by tiki, the background painters have to use a lot of pattern. Pittenger said [...] "So really, the sky flowers are mostly a whimsical design element that Steve [...] came up with to evoke the look of a flower-print Hawaiian shirt—or something <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> don't know what they are either." ...|$|E

Pujols maintained after the game {{that he was more}} concerned with winning than the numbers: [...] "I don't look at numbers", he said. [...] "I don't know. I didn't know anything about [...] until you guys brought it up. Because that's not me. I don't get locked in on numbers. I don't get locked in on anything <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> get locked in on seeing the ball and helping my team out to win and hopefully doing some damage out there." ...|$|E

500|$|Carter openly wept in {{the locker}} room after the game and was {{affected}} so badly by the loss that he considered retirement. [...] "Walking off that field and losing like that," [...] Carter reflected, [...] "I didn't even know if I wanted to play football anymore. Because I just, I felt <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would never win after that." [...] He went on to call the game, [...] "The most devastating loss that I've ever been a part of." [...] Both Carter and fellow Hall of Fame member Randle believed that the 1998 Vikings team was their best chance at winning a Super Bowl; neither player would ever reach the Super Bowl in their careers.|$|E

I never get to play parts <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> always play the friend of a friend, never the lead. And the script surprised me." [...] Carl stated it was very unlikely she would recoup her money, but Smith decided she [...] "believe in this project, and my expectations have already been fulfilled by making the movie", and added: [...] "You can support art even if it's {{not going to make}} a zillion dollars."

500|$|Aaron Ramsey, {{who scored}} Arsenal's winning {{goal in the}} FA Cup final, was adamant their recent success would make his {{teammates}} determined to win more. He aimed for victory in the Community Shield, as it would provide a platform for {{what he described as}} [...] "a tough opening couple of games in the Premier League." [...] Samir Nasri, who left Arsenal to join Manchester City in 2011, in the lead-up to the match described the abuse he received from Arsenal supporters since his transfer as [...] "stupid." [...] He went on to explain: [...] "They see it as treason or that I betrayed them but it’s not <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> just look what’s best for me ...

500|$|Love {{claimed she}} was misquoted by Hirschberg, and {{asserted}} {{that she had}} immediately quit using heroin during her first trimester after she discovered she was pregnant. Record executive Danny Goldberg, who {{was a friend of}} Love and Cobain's, defended her against the claims, and commented on her decision to be profiled in the piece: [...] "Courtney had this yearning for mass-culture acceptability and just couldn't say no to something <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> had a sense of foreboding about it, but I had no idea it as gonna be as bad as it was. [...] done a lot of stupid, self-destructive things, but I don't believe she screwed around with her pregnancy. Those allegations were anonymous." [...] Love would later claim that the publication of the article had serious implications for her marriage as well as Cobain's mental state, suggesting it was a factor in his suicide.|$|E

It's just kinda liking a guy, where he's not really for you to like — the forbidden fruit — and me and this other girl happen to like him and we go to war." [...] The video premiered July 21, 2010 on MTV.com. Actor Michael Jai White portrays Minaj's love interest in the video.|$|E

500|$|During the {{production}} of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' 1991 album Blood Sugar Sex Magik, producer Rick Rubin regularly visited singer Anthony Kiedis to review Kiedis' new material. He found a poem titled [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] while flipping through Kiedis' notebook and instantly took an interest in the poignant lyrics. Rubin suggested that Kiedis show it {{to the rest of the}} band: [...] "I thought it was beautiful. I said 'We've got to do this.'" [...] Kiedis was reluctant, as he felt the poem was too emotional and did not fit the Chili Peppers' style. After singing the poem to guitarist John Frusciante and drummer Chad Smith, Kiedis recalls that they [...] "got up and walked over to their instruments and started finding the beat and guitar chords to match it". Frusciante chose the chords he played in the introduction to balance out the depressing nature of the lyrics, saying [...] "my brain interpreted it as being a really sad song so I thought if the lyrics are really sad <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should write some chords that are happier".|$|E
500|$|On March 13, 2006, Hayes {{announced}} that he was quitting the show because of the series' treatment of religion, saying, [...] "There is a place in this world for satire, but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins. Religious beliefs are sacred to people, and at all times should be respected and honored. As a civil rights activist of the past 40 years, I cannot support a show that disrespects those beliefs and practices." [...] The Guardian observed that Hayes did not specifically mention Scientology in his statement. Later in an interview on CNN's Showbiz Tonight, Hayes added he did not see the episode itself, but was told about it. In a separate interview, he reportedly said regarding Parker and Stone, [...] "Guys, you have it all wrong. We're not <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> know that's your thing, but get your information correct, because somebody might believe that shit, you know? But I understand what they're doing. I told them to take a couple of Scientology courses, and understand what we do." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{turning down}} {{a number of}} record labels, the band signed to The Enclave, a record label run by A {{executive}} Tom Zutaut, who had previously signed Guns N' Roses to Geffen. Rootes felt that Zutaut was [...] "great. Very American, very cool, very into his artists." [...] Black Eye was recorded at Metropolis Studios in London and produced by punk rock veteran Bill Price, who had recorded albums by Sex Pistols and The Clash. The album was recorded live {{in the studio and}} the music was not arranged by the producer in order to achieve a rough, live sound. According to Rootes, Price [...] "just recorded us live while we were playing. We did things like putting different guitar tracks on top and stuff <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> did vocals at different times. But we really wanted to get a live sound." [...] The drums were recorded in a stone room using a basic kit that was modeled after a Ringo Starr reissue model, which resulted in a slightly distorted sound. The album was mastered by George Marino at Sterling Sound in New York City.|$|E
