50|$|Läspia {{discovers that}} her wooer {{is the king}} himself, and starts a counter-plot to out-manoeuvre the future queen. When Helena arrives, she takes {{her place in the}} chamber of honour. Läspia is {{supported}} by the United States of Rome who want to prevent Trojanus getting power over the Arcadian king through marriage. To this <b>end,</b> Secret <b>Service</b> <b>man</b> Hercules is despatched to her aid. Hercules frees Paris, and a meeting is arranged between Paris and Helen. The result is just as Läspia and Hercules had hoped: Helena falls in love with the beautiful singing prince and rejects the king. However, Menelaus has inadvertently consumed a love potion meant for Paris, and is consumed by a violent desire for Helena.|$|R
40|$|Objective　To {{explore the}} {{correlation}} between psychosomatic health and situation idiosyncratic coping of army men garrisoned at islands. Methods　By randomized cluster sampling, a total of 499 <b>service</b> <b>men</b> garrisoned at islands were designated as experimental group, and 615 <b>service</b> <b>men</b> garrisoned out of islands were as control group. The both groups were assessed by Chinese Military Psychosomatic Health Scale and Chinese Military Situational Characteristics Scale in the Chinese Soldiers Mental Health Evaluation Instrument (TR- 09), and the influencing factors were analyzed. Results　The scores of each psychosomatic health factor of <b>service</b> <b>men</b> in experimental group were higher than those in control group (t= 7. 513 - 24. 028, P< 0. 01). In the <b>service</b> <b>men</b> of experimental group, the scores of psychotic, anxiety and depression were higher than other factors, and the scores of cardiovascular and skin were lower. With exception of the factors of eye-ear and nervous system, the score of psychosomatic health was lower in the <b>service</b> <b>men</b> with college and above educational background than in those with junior and senior school educational background (F= 0. 526 - 3. 245, P< 0. 05). The psychosomatic health were better in married <b>service</b> <b>men</b> than in unmarried ones (t= 0. 663 - 2. 869, P< 0. 05). With exception of the cardiovascular system, the psychosomatic health score was higher in officers than in soldiers and non-commissioned officers (t=– 1. 434 - – 4. 381, P< 0. 05). With exception of psychotic factor, the psychosomatic health score in <b>service</b> <b>men</b> garrisoned at islands was negatively related to the active coping style (r=– 0. 065 - – 0. 121, P< 0. 05), and positively related to the inactive coping style (r= 0. 062 - 0. 067, P< 0. 05). Conclusions　The psychosomatic health of <b>service</b> <b>men</b> garrisoned at islands is worse. The psychosomatic health of <b>service</b> <b>men</b> with higher educational level, married and low ranked is better. Active coping style is beneficial to psychosomatic health of <b>service</b> <b>men,</b> while inactive coping style plays a damaged role. DOI: 10. 11855 /j. issn. 0577 - 7402. 2013. 11. 01...|$|R
