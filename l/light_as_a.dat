25|$|Light particles, or photons, {{travel at}} the speed of c, the {{constant}} that is conventionally known as the speed of light. This statement is not a tautology, since many modern formulations of relativity do not start with constant speed of <b>light</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> postulate.

For bright stars, this resolving power could be used to image a star's surface during a transit event and see the shadow of the planet transiting. This could provide a direct measurement of the planet's angular radius and, via parallax, its actual radius. This is more accurate than radius estimates based on transit photometry, which are dependent on stellar radius estimates which depend on models of star characteristics. Imaging also provides more accurate determination of the inclination than photometry does.|$|E

25|$|Origin Oils Inc. {{has been}} researching a revolutionary method called the Helix Bioreactor, {{altering}} the common closed-loop growth system. This system utilizes low energy lights in a helical pattern, enabling each algal cell {{to obtain the}} required amount of light. Sunlight can only penetrate a few inches through algal cells, making light a limiting reagent in open-pond algae farms. Each lighting element in the bioreactor is specially altered to emit specific wavelengths of <b>light,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> full spectrum of light is not beneficial to algae growth. In fact, ultraviolet irradiation is actually detrimental as it inhibits photosynthesis, photoreduction, and the 520nm light-dark absorbance change of algae.|$|E
25|$|Beowulf and Old Norse sources present {{him as the}} son of Ohthere and as {{belonging}} to the ruling Yngling (Scylfing) dynasty. These sources also deal with his war against Onela, which he won with foreign assistance: in Beowulf he gained the throne of Sweden by defeating his uncle Onela with Geatish help, and in two Scandinavian sources (Skáldskaparmál and Skjöldunga saga), he is also helped to defeat Onela in the Battle on the Ice of Lake Vänern, but with Danish help. However, Scandinavian sources mostly deal with his interaction with the legendary Danish king Hrólfr Kraki (Hroðulf), and Eadgils is mostly presented in a negative <b>light</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> rich and greedy king.|$|E
25|$|He goes on {{to explain}} that in Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity, the rule that nothing can go faster than the speed of light, does not apply to galaxies in an {{expanding}} universe. He further explains that while that rule may apply in a preexisting static space, it does not apply in an expanding universe. In an expanding cosmic universe galaxies can travel away from each other at speeds in excess of the speed of <b>light.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result of this there are galaxies so far away that the light from them have not reached earth yet and therefore we don't even know they exist. Ferris refers to this phenomenon as a boundless steadily increasing and changing universe with a changing density.|$|E

25|$|Most optical {{phenomena}} can {{be accounted}} for using the classical electromagnetic description of light. Complete electromagnetic descriptions of light are, however, often difficult to apply in practice. Practical optics is usually done using simplified models. The most common of these, geometric optics, treats <b>light</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> collection of rays that travel in straight lines and bend when they pass through or reflect from surfaces. Physical optics is a more comprehensive model of light, which includes wave effects such as diffraction and interference that cannot {{be accounted for}} in geometric optics. Historically, the ray-based model of light was developed first, followed by the wave model of light. Progress in electromagnetic theory in the 19th century led to the discovery that light waves were in fact electromagnetic radiation.|$|E
25|$|In {{practice}} for the Monaco Grand Prix Montoya was penalized to start from the back by race stewards for brake-testing his former Williams teammate, Ralf Schumacher, causing a four car collision. At the Canadian Grand Prix Montoya was in contention for the win, but he was disqualified after leaving the pitlane under a red <b>light.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> Michelin runner, Montoya did not start the US Grand Prix (see 2005 US Grand Prix). The Colombian was on track for a possible podium finish at Magny-Cours when his hydraulics failed. He retired from {{the lead of the}} Hungarian GP due to a broken driveshaft. His teammate had a similar failure 8 GPs before, which shows the differences in suspension geometry between both McLarens as the torsional forces are carried out in different manner.|$|E
25|$|The most revolutionary {{aspect of}} Planck's {{treatment}} of the black body is that it inherently relies on an integer number of oscillators in thermal equilibrium with the electromagnetic field. These oscillators give their entire energy to the electromagnetic field, creating a quantum of light, {{as often as they}} are excited by the electromagnetic field, absorbing a quantum of light and beginning to oscillate at the corresponding frequency. Planck had intentionally created an atomic theory of the black body, but had unintentionally generated an atomic theory of light, where the black body never generates quanta of light at a given frequency with an energy less than hν. However, once realizing that he had quantized the electromagnetic field, he denounced particles of <b>light</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> limitation of his approximation, not a property of reality.|$|E
