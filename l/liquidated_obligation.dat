40|$|This {{study is}} a part of a more {{comprehensive}} one which was organized in 1928 for the purpose of ascertaining what conditions existed in bonded irrigation and drainage districts which were unable to. <b>liquidate</b> <b>obligations</b> incurred. The first such area to be studied was the Delta Area in Millard County. This area was selected for this study because of the pressing need for more detailed and wider information than was available to either the farmers or the bondholders and because available facts based on careful study might aid in achieving fairer settlements. These data might also assist other areas in eliminating wastes which multiply in hastily planned undertakings...|$|R
5000|$|The {{other type}} of garnishment, also known as {{attachment}} (or attachment of earnings), requires the garnishee to deliver all the defendant's money and/or property {{in the hands of}} the garnishee at the time of service of process to the court, to be paid over to the plaintiff. Since this type of garnishment is not continuing in nature, but is not subject to the type of restrictions that apply to wage garnishment, it is most often used against banks, or other persons or companies that incur <b>liquidated</b> <b>obligations</b> in the regular course of business. The garnishment should not begin during the pay period but instead on the following pay period ...|$|R

40|$|This report {{examines}} {{the possibility of}} the federal government reaching its statutory debt limit and not raising it, with a particular focus on government operations. First, the report explains the nature of the federal government's debt, the processes associated with federal borrowing, and historical events that may influence prospective actions. It also includes an analysis of what could happen if the federal government may no longer issue debt, has exhausted alternative sources of cash, and, therefore, depends on incoming receipts or other sources of funds to provide any cash needed to <b>liquidate</b> federal <b>obligations.</b> 2 Finally, this report lays out considerations for increasing the debt limit under current policy and what impact fiscal policy could have on the debt limit going forward...|$|R
50|$|The CCC {{has its own}} disbursing {{authority}} and utilizes the Federal Reserve Bank system and United States Treasury to make payments. This disbursing authority allows the CCC to make payments quickly and to provide financial support to Americaâ€™s producers and farmers immediately. The CCC has multiple funding mechanisms. Most of the domestic programs are operated out of a revolving fund, in which the CCC has a permanent indefinite borrowing authority, as defined by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-11, Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget. Borrowing authority permits the Corporation to incur obligations and authorizes it to borrow funds to <b>liquidate</b> the <b>obligations.</b> This fund also receives money from appropriated funding for costs incurred (i.e., realized losses), loan repayments, inventory sales, interest income, and fees. Additionally, the CCC receives direct appropriations for specific programs such as its Credit Reform programs, foreign grant and donation programs, and disaster relief.|$|R
40|$|Other written product {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This report provides information on the legal requirements for recognizing and recording obligations under the Defense Health Program (DHP), specifically focusing on (1) the legal basis for obligations incurred by TRICARE Management Activity for, among other services, medical services provided directly by the Department of Defense (DOD) to beneficiaries as well as medical services provided by civilian contractors who subsequently bill DHP for those services, (2) the legal basis for obligations for costs of change orders or other negotiated settlements, and (3) whether the Antideficiency Act applies to DHP obligations and expenditures. GAO held that (1) DOD 's practices in obligating funds are consistent with federal regulations, (2) DOD should record obligations for change orders against the appropriation current {{at the time the}} services are rendered, and (3) DOD may enter into obligations in excess of available resources, but it must obtain appropriations sufficient to <b>liquidate</b> those <b>obligations.</b> ...|$|R
2500|$|Budget {{authority}} {{is the legal}} authority provided by federal law to enter into financial obligations {{that will result in}} immediate or future outlays involving federal government funds.

The term [...] "appropriations" [...] refers to budget authority to incur obligations and to make payments from the Treasury for specified purposes. Some military and some housing programs have multi-year appropriations, in which their budget {{authority is}} specified for several coming fiscal years.|$|R
5|$|A {{deal for}} the sale of Constitution Center was agreed to in December 2012. MetLife and an {{unidentified}} investor (represented by Clarion Partners LLC) each purchased a 50 percent interest in the building. The sale price was $734 million, or $524 per square foot (0.093 square meters). The sale price was the most expensive in D.C. history for a single building. (It was not the most paid per square foot, however. That record went to two-building Market Square at 701 and 801 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, which sold in 2011 to Wells Real Estate Investment Trust for $905 per square foot.) When the deal closed in February 2013, David Nassif Associates announces it would wind down its operations and <b>liquidate</b> its remaining <b>obligations.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} year, Brothers Rosenthal, Cantor, Adlin {{were elected}} Chancellors. The Board {{this year was}} confronted with great financial difficulties. The Fraternity had suffered severe financial reversals in the last convention, and every available source of income was stretched {{to the breaking point}} in order to <b>liquidate</b> the outstanding <b>obligations.</b> However, the year that followed was characterized by many hopeful signs, such as financial recuperation, fraternal consolidation and conservative expansion. In 1928, an auditing committee was appointed to inspect the accounts of the fraternity. Furthermore, it became mandatory that the records of Sigma Alpha Rho be held open to all brothers at all times. Another rule passed this year provided that all chapters which failed to pay their per capita tax would be excluded from representation in the National Executive Councils.|$|R
40|$|A {{caricature}} of President Martin Van Buren issued during the Panic of 1837, strongly critical of his continuation of predecessor Andrew Jackson's hard-money policies. Particular reference {{is made to}} the Specie Circular, a highly unpopular order issued by the Jackson administration in December 1836, directing collectors of public revenues to accept only gold or silver (i. e., "specie") in payment for public lands. Designed to curb speculation, the measure was blamed by administration critics for draining the economy of hard money and precipitating the 1837 crisis. Hearkening back to the anti-Jackson "King Andrew the First" (no. 1833 - 4), the artist portrays Van Buren as a monarch in a princely cloak, treading on the Constitution. He is crowned "in the name of Belzebub... Ragamuffin king" by a demon. Van Buren's cloak is trimmed with "shinplasters," the colloquial term for the often worthless small-denomination bank notes which proliferated during the panic. Van Buren says, "I like this cloak amazingly, for now I shall {{be able to put}} into execution my Designs without being observed by every quizing, prying Whig. I'm obliged to keep close since my Safety Fund is blown... " Under the Safety Fund law, passed during Van Buren's term as governor of New York, banks were required to contribute to a fund used to <b>liquidate</b> the <b>obligations</b> of banks that failed. The fund was quickly exhausted during the panic. On the walls are pictures of "Bequests of the Late Incumbent" (Andrew Jackson), including "The Hickory Stick," worshipped by the masses like the brazen serpent in the Old Testament, Jackson's spectacles and clay pipe, his hat, the Safety Fund balloon in flames, and "the Last Gold Coin," minted in 1829 (the year Jackson first took office). On the wall at right is a headless statue of Jackson holding a "veto" in his right hand (an allusion to Jackson's 1832 veto of a bill to recharter the Bank of the United States). Visible through a window is a street scene where a crowd mobs a theater exhibiting "a Real Gold Coin. " Beneath Van Buren's feet are several documents, including the Specie Circular and "petitions," the missives from New York bankers and merchants which deluged the White House calling for repeal of the Circular. A document labeled "Indian claims" refers to another unpopular Jackson legacy: the numerous grievances by tribes like the Cherokees and Seminoles regarding unfair and inhumane government treaties by which they were being displaced and deprived of their lands.
