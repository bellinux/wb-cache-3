Finkel debuted as a ring announcer at Madison Square Garden on January 17, 1977. By 1979, he had become the organization's <b>lead</b> <b>ring</b> announcer for their biggest events. Throughout his career, Finkel's distinctive voice was sometimes used in the title sequence for the company's various television programs.

Finkel came up with the event name [...] "WrestleMania", as well as Ricky Steamboat's [...] "Dragon" [...] nickname.

50|$|The skill {{involved}} in casting weights was enormous; as most weights {{were less than}} 2½ ounces and their exact mass was meticulously measured. They were a standard of measure {{to be used in}} trade, and had to be accurate. The goldsmith, or adwumfo, would make adjustments if the casting weighed too much or too little. Even the most beautiful, figurative weights had limbs and horns removed, or edges filed down until it met the closest weight equivalent. Weights that were not heavy enough would have small <b>lead</b> <b>rings</b> or glass beads attached to bring up the weight to the desired standard. There are far more weights without modifications than not, speaking to the talent of the goldsmiths. Most weights were within 3% of their theoretical value; this variance is similar to those of European nest weights from the same time.|$|R

50|$|After PCP is {{released}} into the atmosphere it decomposes through photolysis. The main biodegradative pathway for PCP is reductive dehalogenation. In this process, the compound PCP is broken down to tetrachlorophenols, trichlorophenols, and dichlorophenols. Another pathway is methylation to pentachloroanisole (a more lipid-soluble compound). These two methods eventually <b>lead</b> to <b>ring</b> cleavage and complete degradation.|$|R
40|$|At the Yavne-Yam site in Israel, a Bronze Age coastal {{industrial}} establishment, {{a variety}} of lead objects were found which appear to have some connection with fishing and maritime activities, including bells, weights, and rings of various sizes. At numerous other ancient coastal sites throughout the Mediterranean, similar objects have been documented but no systematic or typological study yet {{has been made of}} them. This study focuses primarily on the archaeological context and potential uses of the <b>lead</b> <b>rings</b> that have been found in maritime contexts, which range in size from small grommets to large, saucer-sized circlet. The potential uses for such <b>lead</b> <b>rings</b> include net and anchor weights, devices for detangling caught fishing line, and securing brail lines. The context, size, and typology of the rings could be indicative of their functions as well as the size of the assemblages and their date. Additionally, ancient texts can provide some insight on ancient sailing and fishing practices, in particular the work of Strabo and Oppian. Some preliminary results and conclusions based on these investigations are presented here. In addition to {{a variety of}} <b>rings,</b> a <b>lead</b> “bell” with a ball in the middle and several similar objects were also found at the Yavne-Yam site. In context, these discoveries suggest that bells were used in certain types of fishing at Yavne-Yam in antiquity, perhaps as described in Oppian. Conversely, they could also have been used as sounding weights to find the depth of the water and what the seabed was made of. Since the “bells” come in different shapes and sizes, they could have served multiple different purposes. This study helps us understand the range of possible identifications and functions when considering the correct labeling of Yavne-Yam’s lead objects. Most importantly, connecting these uses to their societies and creating a more accurate historic profile provides a way for Mediterranean archaeologists to help identify the objects and understand their role on a bigger stage...|$|R

A. SCOPE This method of test, which is a modification of AASHTO Designation T 133, is used for determining the apparent specific gravity of fine aggregates proposed for use in bituminous mixes, cement treated bases, and aggregate bases. B. APPARATUS AND MATERIALS 1. Flask: The standard LeChatelier flask conforming to the dimensions shown in Figure 1. 2. Weighted collar: A rubber or neoprenecovered <b>lead</b> <b>ring</b> having an inside diameter of approximately 64 mm and of sufficient mass to keep the flask upright in the water bath. 3. Tank: A constant temperature water bath of sufficient depth to maintain the water level at about the 24 -mL line of the immersed flask. (The tank is not necessary if the test is performed in a constant temperature room.) 4. Balance: A balance having a capacity of 100 g and sensitive to 0. 1 g or less. 5. Brush: A brush small enough to insert in cylinder portion of LeChatelier flask is required. 6. Kerosene or stoddard solvent C. PROCEDURE 1. Split or quarter a fine aggregate test sample weighing approximately 100 g. 2. Dry to constant mass at 110 ± 5 ˚C and cool to room temperature. 3. Fill the LeChatelier flask with kerosene to a level slightly above the zero line. 4. Dry the inside of the flask above the 24 -mL line and insert the stopper. 5. Lower a weighted collar over the stem of the flask and let it rest on the bulb. (The collar is not necessary when the test is performed in a constant temperature room). 6.
