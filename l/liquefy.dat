5|$|In 1823, Michael Faraday, then an {{assistant}} in Davy's lab, successfully liquefied chlorine {{and went on}} to <b>liquefy</b> all known gaseous elements, except for nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen. Shortly after, in 1869, Irish chemist Thomas Andrews studied the phase transition from a liquid to a gas and coined the term critical point to describe the condition where a gas and a liquid were indistinguishable as phases, and Dutch physicist Johannes van der Waals supplied the theoretical framework which allowed the prediction of critical behavior based on measurements at much higher temperatures. By 1908, James Dewar and Heike Kamerlingh Onnes were successfully able to <b>liquefy</b> hydrogen and then newly discovered helium, respectively.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 19th century {{scientists}} realized that air could be liquefied and its components isolated by compressing and cooling it. Using a cascade method, Swiss chemist and physicist Raoul Pierre Pictet evaporated liquid sulfur dioxide {{in order to}} <b>liquefy</b> carbon dioxide, which in turn was evaporated to cool oxygen gas enough to <b>liquefy</b> it. He sent a telegram on December 22, 1877 to the French Academy of Sciences in Paris announcing his discovery of liquid oxygen. Just two days later, French physicist Louis Paul Cailletet announced his own method of liquefying molecular oxygen. Only {{a few drops of}} the liquid were produced in each case and no meaningful analysis could be conducted. Oxygen was liquified in a stable state {{for the first time on}} March 29, 1883 by Polish scientists from Jagiellonian University, Zygmunt Wróblewski and Karol Olszewski.|$|E
5|$|A herbivorous species, Bagheera kiplingi, was {{described}} in 2008, but all other known species are predators, mostly preying on insects and on other spiders, although a few large species also take birds and lizards. It is estimated that the world's 25 million tons of spiders kill 400–800 million tons of prey per year. Spiders use {{a wide range of}} strategies to capture prey: trapping it in sticky webs, lassoing it with sticky bolas, mimicking the prey to avoid detection, or running it down. Most detect prey mainly by sensing vibrations, but the active hunters have acute vision, and hunters of the genus Portia show signs of intelligence in their choice of tactics and ability to develop new ones. Spiders' guts are too narrow to take solids, and they <b>liquefy</b> their food by flooding it with digestive enzymes. They also grind food with the bases of their pedipalps, as arachnids do not have the mandibles that crustaceans and insects have.|$|E

5|$|Buildings {{and other}} {{structures}} were extensively damaged during the earthquake, but roadways and railways also experienced disturbances. Many case histories pertaining to liquefaction in sandy soil exist, but few exist {{with respect to}} gravel and gravelly sands. In certain situations gravelly sands may <b>liquefy</b> in similar fashion as saturated sands. The first well-documented case of liquefaction in gravelly sands was {{in regard to the}} 1983 Borah Peak earthquake in the United States. Several investigations of that event took place in the 1980s and early 1990s and the primary conclusions were that a critical condition for liquefaction to occur in that type of soil was the presence of a low permeable crust that did not allow pore water pressures to subside and that the assessment method and associated standard penetration test values used with sandy soils also applied to gravelly soils.|$|E
5|$|For {{large-scale}} use, helium {{is extracted}} by fractional distillation from natural gas, which can contain {{as much as}} 7% helium. Since helium has a lower boiling point than any other element, low temperature and high pressure are used to <b>liquefy</b> nearly all the other gases (mostly nitrogen and methane). The resulting crude helium gas is purified by successive exposures to lowering temperatures, in which {{almost all of the}} remaining nitrogen and other gases are precipitated out of the gaseous mixture. Activated charcoal is used as a final purification step, usually resulting in 99.995% pure Grade-A helium. The principal impurity in Grade-A helium is neon. In a final production step, most of the helium that is produced is liquefied via a cryogenic process. This is necessary for applications requiring liquid helium and also allows helium suppliers to reduce the cost of long distance transportation, as the largest liquid helium containers have more than five times the capacity of the largest gaseous helium tube trailers.|$|E
25|$|The cooling {{produced}} in the Joule–Thomson expansion makes it a valuable tool in refrigeration. The effect is applied in the Linde technique as a standard process in the petrochemical industry, where the cooling effect is used to <b>liquefy</b> gases, and also in many cryogenic applications (e.g. {{for the production of}} liquid oxygen, nitrogen, and argon). A gas must be below its inversion temperature to be liquefied by the Linde cycle. For this reason, simple Linde cycle liquefiers, starting from ambient temperature, cannot be used to <b>liquefy</b> helium, hydrogen, or neon. However, the Joule–Thomson effect can be used to <b>liquefy</b> even helium, provided that the helium gas is first cooled below its inversion temperature of 40 K.|$|E
40|$|Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) sawdust {{was used}} to produce <b>liquefied</b> wood by the polyhydric method with acid catalysis. The process was {{optimized}} to produce the highest amount of <b>liquefied</b> wood. Wood <b>liquefied</b> at 160 ºC for 90 min {{was used in the}} adhesion tests. The bond strength of veneer glued with urea-formaldehyde and melamine-urea-formaldehyde resins and several mixtures of <b>liquefied</b> wood with urea- formaldehyde and melamine-urea-formaldehyde wasevaluated by automated bonding evaluation system. With the increase in <b>liquefied</b> wood content the bond strength decreased. Nevertheless for 20 % <b>liquefied</b> wood the reduction of internal bond strength is relatively small and still within the minimum standards required. When 70 % of <b>liquefied</b> wood is employed there is a significant decrease in bond strength.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{formulae}} are deduced for the floatation {{response of}} pipeline buried in <b>liquefied</b> soil. The beam model {{based on the}} theory of beam on elastic foundation {{is used for the}} pipeline buried in non-liquefied and <b>liquefied</b> soil. The soil property is nonlinear, the floating force induced by the soil liquefaction is related to the position of pipeline, is nonlinear also. For the convenience and simplification of analysis, the nonlinear increment element method was used and lots of numerical analysis was conducted, including: the floatation response of pipeline buried in homogeneous soil, the floatation response of pipeline buried in non-homogeneous soil, and the floatation response of pipeline buried in discontinuous <b>liquefied</b> area. The influential factors on the floatation response of buried pipeline buried in <b>liquefied</b> soil including spring stiff of <b>liquefied</b> soil, the initial deformation, the length of <b>liquefied</b> area, the axial force acting on the pipeline, the material of pipeline, and the diameter of pipeline. The calculation results of discontinuous <b>liquefied</b> area draw a significant conclusion that for a long <b>liquefied</b> area, to make the soil non-liquefied in the middle of <b>liquefied</b> area may decrease the length of <b>liquefied</b> area and reduce the flotation displacement of pipeline greatly...|$|R

40|$|<b>Liquefied</b> wood is a {{potential}} alternative to the synthetic adhesives which are used for the bonding of wood. Despite the ability of <b>liquefied</b> wood to self-crosslink, bonds formed during the bonding of wood with <b>liquefied</b> wood do not achieve sufficient shear strength and have poor resistance to water. For this reason {{the process of the}} curing of <b>liquefied</b> wood, the influence of various parameters on the shear strength of bonds, and the structure of bonds formed during the bonding were analyzed. It was found that the chemical curing of <b>liquefied</b> wood started after water and solvent had been removed from it. When bonding wood, the curing of <b>liquefied</b> wood takes place faster because, in addition to evaporation, the transition of both vaporous components from the <b>liquefied</b> wood to the lamellas also occurs. During the bonding of 5 mm thick beech lamellas with <b>liquefied</b> wood having a negative pH, at optimal bonding conditions (180 °C, 12 min), a specific type of bond was formed. It consisted of a central part of carbonized wood cells of the bonded lamellas and the cured <b>liquefied</b> wood, and a narrow layer of partly delignified wood cells at the border between the central part and bonded lamella...|$|R

25|$|Experiments on the {{properties}} of gases started early in the seventeenth century.

During that time there were efforts to <b>liquefy</b> gases. Many new facts on the nature of gases had been discovered. For example, early in the nineteenth century Cagniard de la Tour had shown there was a temperature above which a gas could not be liquefied. There was a major push in the mid to late nineteenth century to <b>liquefy</b> all gases. A number of scientists including Michael Faraday, James Joule, and William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), did experiments in this area.
