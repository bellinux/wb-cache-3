5|$|Curium was {{chemically}} identified at the Metallurgical Laboratory (now Argonne National <b>Laboratory)</b> <b>at</b> the University of Chicago.

5|$|In 1933, Bainbridge {{was awarded}} a prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship, which he used to travel to England and work at Ernest Rutherford's Cavendish <b>Laboratory</b> <b>at</b> Cambridge University.

5|$|On October 29, 1969, {{the first}} {{connection}} {{on a wide}} area network to use packet switching, ARPANET, was established between nodes at Leonard Kleinrock's <b>laboratory</b> <b>at</b> University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and Douglas Engelbart's <b>laboratory</b> <b>at</b> SRI using Interface Message Processors at both sites. The following year, Engelbart's laboratory installed the first TENEX system outside of BBN where it was developed. In addition to SRI and UCLA, University of California, Santa Barbara and the University of Utah {{were part of the}} original four network nodes. By December 5, 1969, the entire four-node network was connected. In the 1970s, SRI developed packet-switched radio (a precursor to wireless networking), over-the-horizon radar, Deafnet, vacuum microelectronics, and software-implemented fault tolerance.|$|E

5|$|The twenty-five {{square foot}} Cori <b>laboratory</b> <b>at</b> Washington University was deemed a National Historic Landmark by the American Chemical Society. Not {{only did the}} Coris conduct {{groundbreaking}} research there, but they mentored many scientists. Six of these {{went on to win}} Nobel Prizes, which is unmatched in scientific history.|$|E
5|$|A {{graduate}} of Carnegie Tech, Morrison {{became interested in}} physics, which he studied at the University of California, Berkeley, {{under the supervision of}} J. Robert Oppenheimer. He also joined the Communist Party. During World War II he joined the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical <b>Laboratory</b> <b>at</b> the University of Chicago, where he worked with Eugene Wigner on the design of nuclear reactors.|$|E
5|$|After Fermi died in 1954, the Marshalls separated. John Marshall {{returned}} to the Los Alamos Laboratory, while Leona, now effectively a single mother, became {{a fellow at the}} Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey in 1957. The following year she became a fellow at the Brookhaven National <b>Laboratory,</b> <b>at</b> a time when the focus of research in physics was shifting away from the nucleus and towards elementary particles. In 1960, she joined New York University as an associate professor of physics. She became a professor in 1962.|$|E

5|$|After he {{finished}} his Ph.D. Morrison took a position as an instructor at San Francisco State College. In 1941 he became an instructor at the University of Illinois. In December 1942, with World War II raging around the globe, he was recruited by Robert F. Christy to join the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical <b>Laboratory</b> <b>at</b> the University of Chicago in January 1943. There he worked with Eugene Wigner {{on the design of}} nuclear reactors.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} his PhD {{from the}} University of Chicago in 1936, Alvarez {{went to work}} for Ernest Lawrence at the Radiation <b>Laboratory</b> <b>at</b> the University of California in Berkeley. Alvarez devised a set of experiments to observe K-electron capture in radioactive nuclei, predicted by the beta decay theory but never before observed. He produced tritium using the cyclotron and measured its lifetime. In collaboration with Felix Bloch, he measured the magnetic moment of the neutron.|$|E
5|$|Agnew {{joined the}} Metallurgical <b>Laboratory</b> <b>at</b> the University of Chicago in 1942, and {{helped build the}} Chicago Pile-1, the world's first nuclear reactor.

5|$|In 2007, a {{wildlife}} monitoring organization, WildTrack, started using JMP with the Footprint Identification Technology (FIT) system to identify individual endangered animals by their footprints. In 2009, the Chicago Botanic Garden used JMP to analyze DNA data from tropical breadfruit. Researchers {{determined that the}} seedless, starchy fruit {{was created by the}} deliberate hybridization of two fruits, the breadnut and the dugdug. The Herzenberg <b>Laboratory</b> <b>at</b> Stanford has integrated JMP with the Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS). The FACS system is used to study HIV, cancer, stem-cells and oceanography.|$|E

5|$|In early 1942, {{with the}} United States now embroiled World War II, Arthur Compton {{concentrated}} the Manhattan Project's various teams working on plutonium at the Metallurgical <b>Laboratory</b> <b>at</b> the University of Chicago. Zinn used athletes to build Fermi's increasingly large experimental configurations under the stands of the disused Stagg Field. In July 1942, Fermi measured a k = 1.007 from a uranium oxide lattice. This raised hopes that pure uranium would yield a suitable value of k.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the {{nutrition}} <b>laboratory</b> <b>at</b> Berkeley was renamed Agnes Fay Morgan Hall.

5|$|In {{the early}} years of World War II between 1939 and 1941, Wigner led the Princeton group in a series of {{experiments}} involving uranium and two tons of graphite as a neutron moderator. In early 1942, Arthur Compton concentrated the Manhattan Project's various teams working on plutonium and nuclear reactor design, including Wigner's team from Princeton, at the Metallurgical <b>Laboratory</b> <b>at</b> the University of Chicago. The name was a codename; Creutz was the first to conduct actual metallurgy research, and he hired its first metallurgist to work with him.|$|E
