25|$|HID {{headlamp}} burners produce between 2,800 and 3,500 <b>lumens</b> {{from between}} 35 and 38 watts of electrical power, while halogen filament headlamp bulbs produce between 700 and 2,100 <b>lumens</b> from between 40 and 72 watts at 12.8V.|$|E
25|$|Lamps {{designed}} for different voltages have different luminous efficacy. For example, a 100-watt, 120-volt lamp will produce about 17.1 <b>lumens</b> per watt. A lamp {{with the same}} rated lifetime but {{designed for}} 230 V would produce only around 12.8 <b>lumens</b> per watt, and a similar lamp designed for 30 volts (train lighting) would produce as much as 19.8 <b>lumens</b> per watt. Lower voltage lamps have a thicker filament, for the same power rating. They can run hotter for the same lifetime before the filament evaporates.|$|E
30|$|The true <b>lumen</b> {{more often}} has a {{cylindrical}} or filiform shape. It is in clear continuity with the non-dissected proximal {{portion of the}} aorta (this {{is more difficult to}} demonstrate for type A dissections). In acute dissections it is the <b>lumen</b> that contains outer wall calcification. Usually the true <b>lumen</b> starts opacifying earlier in the arterial phase [22]. The false <b>lumen</b> has a characteristic “beak” appearance; this is an acute angle between the dissection flap and the outer wall of the false <b>lumen.</b> The false <b>lumen</b> starts opacifying later than the true <b>lumen</b> [22]. The use of retrospective gating (more radiation dose) or prospective gating (step and shoot with an option for dose-saving protocols) makes imaging of the entrance tear and re-entries (additional communications between the true and false <b>lumen)</b> easier than ungated CT [6].|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives：In aortic {{dissection}} (AD), CT angiography (CTA) {{is useful}} both in initial dia-gnosis {{and long term}} follow-up. In this study, we used CTA to evaluate the morphologic changes of aorta after AD. Subjects and Methods：We reviewed the initial and follow-up CTA images of 43 patients with AD. The diagnoses were double-lumen dissection (n＝ 13), intramural hematoma (n＝ 11), and residual dissection after surgery (n＝ 19). The duration of CTA follow-up was 3. 3 ± 1. 9 years (range 7 - 89 months). After reviewing the CTA images of the thoracic aorta level, and of {{the upper and lower}} abdominal aorta levels, we compared the areas of total <b>lumen,</b> true <b>lumen</b> and false <b>lumen</b> and the area ratio of true/total <b>lumen.</b> Results：Changes in luminal areas were greatest in the thoracic aorta, where both the true <b>lumen</b> area and the ratio of true/total <b>lumen</b> area increased. Subgroup analysis revealed that although the total <b>lumen</b> area increased significantly in the classic AD group, no changes were noted in the ratio of true/total <b>lumen</b> area. Only the increase in false lu-men area (from 5. 8 cm 2 to 9. 0 cm 2) was significant (p＝ 0. 036). In patients with intramural hematoma, a decr-ease in total <b>lumen</b> area and an increase in the ratio of true/total <b>lumen</b> area were noted. Conclusion：In classic AD, false <b>lumen</b> dilatation occurs with false <b>lumen</b> enlargement, whereas in intramural hematoma total aorta size decreases with any increase in the ratio of true/total <b>lumen</b> area.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that <b>lumen</b> diameter loss within 1 h after {{percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty}} is related to plaque volume parameters. Background: Early <b>lumen</b> diameter loss after coronary balloon angioplasty may predict restenosis and may paradoxically decrease late <b>lumen</b> diameter loss. Viscous properties of the vessel wall, as would be determined by tissue volume and composition, may be involved in early <b>lumen</b> diameter loss. METHODS: Early <b>lumen</b> diameter loss was measured with quantitative coronary angiography as the loss in lesion <b>lumen</b> diameter (significant loss 0. 4 mm) occurring between 5 min and a median of 40 min after successful coronary balloon angioplasty in 68 patients. Thirty-nine patients were evaluated with intravascular ultrasound at the narrowest <b>lumen</b> cross-section of the dilated lesion, 29 patients formed a control group without intravascular ultrasound imaging. We tested the relation between intravascular ultrasound parameters and early <b>lumen</b> diameter loss. RESULTS: Early <b>lumen</b> diameter loss of > or = 0. 4 mm was present in eight patients (12 %), decreasing <b>lumen</b> diameter from 2. 26 +/- 0. 36 mm to 1. 73 +/- 0. 43 mm. There was no difference in the frequency of early <b>lumen</b> diameter loss between the groups with or without intravascular ultrasound imaging. Univariate intravascular ultrasound determinants of early <b>lumen</b> diameter loss were media bounded area (p = 0. 01), maximal plaque thickness (p = 0. 02), eccentricity index (p = 0. 03) and the presence of hard lesions (p = 0. 02).

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{assessed}} {{the relation between}} histologic acute and long-term <b>lumen</b> size after coronary angioplasty. Background. Angiographic {{studies suggest that the}} creation of a larger acute lmmen is associated with a reduced incidence of restenosis. Histologic evaluation of the influence of the acute <b>lumen</b> on late outcome has not been previously reported. Methods. Detailed histologic examination and planimetry were performed in 28 postmortem coronary arteries subjected to angioplasty at an average of 71 weeks antemortem. The <b>lumen</b> area on each histologic segment was defined as the final <b>lumen</b> area. The <b>lumen</b> area immediately after angioplasty, the acute <b>lumen</b> area, was deined by the sum of the neointimal area plus final <b>lumen.</b> A final <b>lumen</b> area ≥ 25 % of the arterial area was considered a long-term success; a final <b>lumen</b> area < 25 % was considered a long-term failure. Results. Arterial size and neointimal area were similar in long-term successes aid failures. In successes, the mean (±SD) acute <b>lumen</b> area was greater than in failures (4. 1 ± 1. 9 vs. 2. 7 ± 1. 4 mm 2, respectively, p < 0. 001). The acute <b>lumen</b> area as a percent of arterial area was 46 ± 10 % in successes versus 27 ± 11 % in failures (p < 0. 0001). The corresponding estimated mean acute <b>lumen</b> diameter stenosis was 24 ± 8 % in successes versus 42 ± 12 % in failures (p < 0. 0001). Plaque area was greater in failures (7. 1 ± 3. 2 mm 2) than in successes (4. 8 ± 2. 4 mm 2, p < 0. 002). Conclusions. Neointimal proliferation after angioplasty occurs in all dilated coronary arteries, and the amount of neointimal growth is independent of vessel size. The creation of a larger <b>lumen</b> and a larger <b>lumen</b> as a percent of vessel size were associated with an improved long-term histologic patency...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesIn acute type B aortic {{dissection}} (ABAD) {{a patent}} false <b>lumen</b> portends a poor outcome. Patent branch vessels originating from the false <b>lumen</b> in a type B aortic dissection {{are assumed to}} contribute to persistent blood flow and patent false <b>lumen.</b> Therefore, the morphologic changes of the false <b>lumen</b> generated by different outflow rates in an in vitro model were investigated. MethodsAn artificial dissection was created in two ex vivo porcine aortas. A thin cannula {{was placed in the}} false <b>lumen,</b> simulating a branch vessel originating from it. The aorta was positioned in a validated in vitro circulatory system with physiological pulsatile flow (1, 500 – 2, 700 mL/minute) and pressure characteristics (130 / 70  mmHg). The cannula was attached to a small silicone tube with an adjustable valve mechanism. Three different valve settings were used for creating outflow from the false <b>lumen</b> (fully closed, opened at 50 %, and fully opened at 100 %). Measurements of <b>lumen</b> areas and flow rates were assessed with time-resolved magnetic resonance imaging. In order to study reproducibility, the experiment was performed twice in two different porcine aortas with a similar morphology. ResultsIncreasing antegrade outflow through the branch vessel of the false <b>lumen</b> resulted in a significant (p < . 01) increase of the mean false <b>lumen</b> area at the proximal and distal location in both models. The distal false <b>lumen</b> expanded up to 107 % in the case of high outflow via the false <b>lumen</b> through the branch vessel. ConclusionsIncreasing antegrade outflow through a branch vessel originating from the false <b>lumen</b> when no distal re-entry tear is present results in an expansion of the cross sectional false <b>lumen</b> area...|$|R

40|$|During Drosophila melanogaster heart development, a <b>lumen</b> forms between apical {{surfaces}} of contralateral cardioblasts (CBs).

Mislocalization of Slit outside the apical domain causes ectopic <b>lumen</b> formation and the mislocalization of cell junction proteins, E-cadherin (E-Cad) and Enabled, without disrupting overall CB cell polarity. Ectopic <b>lumen</b> formation is suppressed in robo mutants, which indicates robo's requirement for this process.

40|$|BackgroundFollow-up {{mortality}} {{is high in}} patients with type B aortic dissection (TB-AD) approaching one in four patients at 3 years. A predictor of increased {{mortality is}} partial thrombosis of the false <b>lumen</b> which may occlude distal tears. The hemodynamic consequences of differing tear size, location, and patency within the false <b>lumen</b> is largely unknown. We examined the impact of intimal tear size, tear number, and location on false <b>lumen</b> pressure. MethodsIn an ex-vivo model of chronic type B aortic dissection connected to a pulsatile pump, simultaneous pressures were measured within the true and false <b>lumen.</b> Experiments were performed in different dissection models with tear sizes of 6. 4 mm and 3. 2 mm in the following configurations; model A: proximal and distal tear simulating the most common hemodynamic state in patients with TB-AD; model B: proximal tear only simulating patients with partial thrombosis and occlusion of distal tear; and model C: distal tear only simulating patients sealed proximally via a stent graft with persistent distal communication. To compare false <b>lumen</b> diastolic pressure between models, a false <b>lumen</b> pressure index (FPI%) was calculated for all simulations as FPI% = (false <b>lumen</b> diastolic pressure/true <b>lumen</b> diastolic pressure) × 100. ResultsIn model A, the systolic pressure was slightly lower in the false <b>lumen</b> compared with the true <b>lumen</b> while the diastolic pressure (DP) was slightly higher in the false <b>lumen</b> (DP 66. 45 ± 0. 16 mm Hg vs 66. 20 ± 0. 12 mm Hg, P <. 001, FPI% = 100. 4 %). In {{the absence of a}} distal tear (model B), diastolic pressure was elevated within the false <b>lumen</b> compared with the true <b>lumen</b> (58. 95 ± 0. 10 vs 54. 66 ± 0. 17, P <. 001, FPI% = 107. 9 %). The absence of a proximal tear {{in the presence of a}} distal tear (model C) diastolic pressure was also elevated within the false <b>lumen</b> versus the true <b>lumen</b> (58. 72 ± 0. 24 vs 56. 15 ± 0. 16, P <. 001, FPI% 104. 6 %). The difference in diastolic pressure was greatest with a smaller tear (3. 2 mm) in model B. In model B, DBP increased by 13. 9 % (P <. 001, R 2 0. 69) per 10 beat per minute increase in heart rate (P <. 001) independent of systolic pressure. ConclusionsIn this model of chronic type B aortic dissection, diastolic false <b>lumen</b> pressure was the highest in the setting of smaller proximal tear size and the lack of a distal tear. These determinants of inflow and outflow may impact false <b>lumen</b> expansion and rupture during the follow-up period. Clinical RelevanceFollow-up mortality rates are high in patients discharged from the hospital after an acute type B aortic dissection. Previous data has suggested that patients with complete thrombosis of the false <b>lumen</b> have improved outcomes, whereas those with a patent false <b>lumen</b> have an increased risk of aortic expansion and death. Recent data indicates that partial thrombosis of the false <b>lumen</b> (the presence of both flow and thrombus) is a strong independent predictor of mortality in these patients. A potential mechanism of poor outcomes in these patients may relate to the obstruction of distal tears by thrombus from the false <b>lumen</b> to the true <b>lumen</b> resulting in restricted outflow and a subsequent increase in false <b>lumen</b> pressure. Our model examines this hypothesis by measuring the pressures in the true and false <b>lumen</b> in an ex-vivo model of aortic dissection by varying the determinants of inflow and outflow...|$|R

50|$|Dissections become {{threatening}} {{to the health}} of the organism when growth of the false <b>lumen</b> prevents perfusion of the true <b>lumen</b> and the end organs perfused by the true <b>lumen.</b> For example, in an aortic dissection, if the left subclavian artery orifice were distal to the origin of the dissection, then the left subclavian would be said to be perfused by the false <b>lumen,</b> while the left common carotid (and its end organ, the left hemisphere of the brain) if proximal to the dissection, would be perfused by the true <b>lumen</b> proximal to the dissection.|$|R
30|$|Differential {{enhancement}} of false <b>lumen</b> of an aortic dissection {{can also be}} due to delayed opacification due to higher inherent luminal pressures.

True estimation of this false <b>lumen</b> thrombosis after aortic dissection is important as this can be important for prognosis [29]. Delayed phase acquisition is recommended for a more accurate estimation of true extent of false <b>lumen</b> thrombus vs. slow flow. Aortic dissection with partial thrombosis of the false <b>lumen</b> has a significantly higher annual aortic growth rate when compared with those patients with complete thrombosis of the false <b>lumen</b> [30].|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES. To {{characterize}} {{predictors of}} restenosis after successful directional atherectomy, we reviewed the clinical, angiographic and procedural data obtained during 132 consecutive procedures. METHODS. Clinical and angiographic follow-up {{data were obtained}} in a prospectively collected and consecutive series of 125 patients who underwent 132 atherectomy procedures for de novo (89 %) or restenotic (11 %) lesions in native coronary arteries. Restenosis was assessed clinically and by quantitative coronary angiography. A dual approach to data analysis was taken to gain insight into factors affecting the clinical outcome and vessel wall healing response. Therefore, multivariate analysis was performed to 1) determine the correlates of residual <b>lumen</b> diameter at follow-up (angiographic outcome), and 2) characterize the determinants of the late <b>lumen</b> loss (renarrowing process). RESULTS. Clinical and angiographic follow-up data after successful atherectomy were obtained in 100 % and 95 %, respectively. Atherectomy achieved an acute <b>lumen</b> gain of 1. 28 +/- 0. 48 mm (mean +/- SD), resulting in a minimal <b>lumen</b> diameter of 2. 44 +/- 0. 47 mm. At follow-up, the minimal <b>lumen</b> diameter decreased to 1. 78 +/- 0. 64 mm. The angiographic restenosis rate was 28 % if the traditional 50 % stenosis cutoff criterion was applied. Larger vessel size and postatherectomy minimal <b>lumen</b> diameter and right coronary or left circumflex artery lesions were independent predictors of a larger minimal <b>lumen</b> diameter (angiographic outcome). <b>Lumen</b> loss during follow-up (renarrowing process) was independently predicted by relative <b>lumen</b> gain and preprocedural minimal <b>lumen</b> diameter. CONCLUSIONS. In analyzing the long-term results of new interventional techniques such as directional atherectomy, the late <b>lumen</b> loss during follow-up (renarrowing process), which {{is characterized by the}} vessel wall healing response after an intervention, should be considered together with the residual <b>lumen</b> diameter at follow-up (clinical outcome). It is clear that whereas improved clinical outcome is associated with larger vessel size and postprocedural <b>lumen</b> diameter and non-left anterior descending artery location, greater relative gain at intervention is predictive of more extensive <b>lumen</b> renarrowing...|$|R
