50|$|Another {{exercise}} in which spotters are recommended is the barbell squat. Squats should be spotted by two spotters, one {{at each end}} of the bar. In the event of a missed lift, each spotter hooks an elbow under the end of the bar, and takes the plates in both hands. Care must be taken to keep the assistance balanced and coordinated to avoid uneven deloading of the weight and possible torsion injury. If two spotters are unavailable, a single spotter can assist by taking some of the weight off the bar allowing the lifter to return the weight to the rack. Unlike other exercises this exercise does not present much of a chance for the spotters to assist the <b>lifter,</b> <b>as</b> the spotters only intercede in the event of a missed lift.|$|E

30|$|The linearly {{arranged}} seeds {{may cause}} a jam when a seed is lifted {{up to the}} route of the pipeline. To avoid such a jam, a taper is cut in the <b>lifter,</b> <b>as</b> shown in Fig.  12. The length of the Au grain is 2.50 ± 0.01 mm, and the width of the lifter is set to be 2.6 mm. Thus, in addition to the head seed, the front of the next seed is entered into the hole of the lifter. When the lifter moves upward, the surface of the taper collides with {{the front end of the}} next seed, which generates a friction force at the tapered surface. If the angle of the taper is sufficiently large (for example, 70 °), the lifter can overcome the friction and push the next seed back by the taper and therefore the jam can be avoided (Fig.  12 b).|$|E

40|$|Wear of {{grinding}} mill liners and lifters {{plays a major}} role in the overall efficiency and economics of mineral processing.

A set of experiments were performed on a model perspex mill in order to obtain data by which the theory could be compared. The lifter bar is analysed using a parabolic expression which allows the shape to be changed to model various stages oflifter wear. Two possible formulations are investigated in determining the motion of the particle on the lifter bar. The first formulation assumes the ball to roll on the lifter bar until a limiting friction is reached after which the ball will slide along the lifter.

50|$|A {{hydraulic}} valve <b>lifter,</b> also known <b>as</b> a hydraulic tappet or a hydraulic lash adjuster, is a device for maintaining zero valve clearance in an internal combustion engine.

40|$|Pulp <b>lifters,</b> also known, <b>as</b> pan <b>lifters</b> are an {{integral}} part of the majority of autogenous (AG), semi-autogenous (SAG) and grate discharge ball mills. The performance of the pulp lifters in conjunction with grate design determines the ultimate flow capacity of these mills. Although the function of the pulp lifters is simply to transport the slurry passed through the discharge grate into the discharge trunnion, their performance depends on their design as well as that of the grate and operating conditions such as mill speed and charge level. However, little or no work has been reported on the performance of grate-pulp lifter assemblies and in particular the influence of pulp lifter design on slurry transport. Ideally, the discharge rate through a grate-pulp lifter assembly should be equal to the discharge rate through at a given mill hold-up. However, the results obtained have shown that conventional pulp lifter designs cause considerable restrictions to flow resulting in reduced flow capacity. In this second of a two-part series of papers the performance of conventional pulp lifters (radial and spiral designs) is described and is based on extensive test work carried out in a I m diameter pilot SAG mill.

40|$|DEM {{modelling}} of {{the motion}} of coarse fractions of the charge inside SAG mills has now been well established {{for more than a}} decade. In these models the effect of slurry has broadly been ignored due to its complexity. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) provides a particle based method for modelling complex free surface fluid flows and is well suited to modelling fluid flow in mills. Previous modelling has demonstrated the powerful ability of SPH to capture dynamic fluid flow effects such <b>as</b> <b>lifters</b> crashing into slurry pools, fluid draining from lifters, flow through grates and pulp lifter discharge. However, all these examples were limited by the ability to model only the slurry in the mill without the charge. In this paper, we represent the charge as a dynamic porous media through which the SPH fluid is then able to flow. The porous media properties (specifically the spatial distribution of porosity and velocity) are predicted by time averaging the mill charge predicted using a large scale DEM model. This allows prediction of transient and steady state slurry distributions in the mill and allows its variation with operating parameters, slurry viscosity and slurry volume, to be explored.

40|$|International audienceOver the years, rotary kilns {{have become}} an inescapable {{benchmark}} in several industrial sectors. This is because they offer special possibilities regarding {{a wide range of}} materials which can be continuously processed with little or no operating labor, especially when they are automatically controlled. The wider the scope of applications, the greater the variety of kiln designs and sizes. Rotary kilns are widely used for the drying or cooling of solid particles, for instance in the food processing industry when dealing with wet or dry granular materials, for the calcination of limestone, petroleum coke, or production of cement. Other applications include: regeneration of spent catalyst, hazardous waste reclamation, defluorination and reduction of uranyl difluoride and so on. Industrial rotary kilns are usually equipped with internal fixtures such <b>as</b> <b>lifters,</b> baffles, constrictions or exit dams. The complex hydrodynamic behavior of the granular materials within rotary kilns has led to extensive research over the years. Most of these publications report on the influence of operating parameters (rotational speed, kiln slope, mass flow rate or exit dam height) on the residence time distribution (RTD) and axial dispersion of solid particles. However, few of these studies analyze the effect of the presence of lifters, their number or shape. We therefore decided to conduct a systematic experimental investigation of RTD, kiln holdup and axial dispersion coefficient for the continuous flow of granular materials in rotary kilns equipped with lifters. To do so, we used two different pilot scale rotary kilns. One is about twice the size of the other. We investigated both the influence of operating parameters (rotational speed, kiln slope, mass flow rate) and of the presence of internal devices (grid, different shapes and number of lifters, different height of exit dam) on a large range of size and shape of particles (two different sands, rice and beech chips). The large set of experimental data obtained, allowed us to build a model based on dimensional analysis, which is useful for industrial applications...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1993 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of false positive and false negative feedback upon the self-efficacy and performance of high and low self-esteem experienced weight lifters. Among a group of volunteers, 65 experienced male weight <b>lifters</b> were classified <b>as</b> either high or low self-esteem following administration of the Global Self-Worth Scale (Neemann & Harter, 1986). Each was qualified by the ability to perform a one repetition-maximum (1 RM) bench press between 200 to 350 lbs., which was tested through a series of trials. Self-efficacy estimates for the 1 RM bench press were obtained throughout the experiment. Trial sessions were accompanied by manipulated feedback, providing the subjects with either actual, inflated, or deflated values of weights lifted. High and low self-esteem subjects performed tasks differently with respect to the type of feedback received. During the first manipulative treatments, high self-esteem subjects lifted greater weights after receiving false positive feedback and lesser weights after receiving false negative feedback. At all times, low self esteem subjects did not perform differently after the receipt of either false positive or false negative feedback. An analysis of the self-efficacy data demonstrated that predictions for 1 RM bench press performances were not influenced by levels of self-esteem. However, both high and low self-esteem subjects predicted that they would lift greater or lesser weights following the administration of, false positive or false negative feedback, respectively, and both groups of subjects predicted there would be no weight differences following administration of actual feedback. Correlation analyses, conducted to determine relationships between self-efficacy and performance, indicated that during the first day of manipulative feedback treatment there was a positive relationship between self-efficacy and subsequent performance change. Previous performance change and subsequent self-efficacy change were correlated only for high self-esteem subjects during day 2 of the treatment. A regression analysis revealed that self-efficacy change was a better predictor of subsequent performance change than previous performance change. In conclusion, false positive feedback increased self-efficacy and performance of high self-esteem subjects. False negative feedback showed no significant change for either low or high self-esteem subjects...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRotary kilns are gas-solid {{reactors}} {{commonly used}} in industry to achieve {{a wide array of}} material processing operations. Rotary kilns are used for applications such as reduction of oxide ore, pyrolysis of hazardous waste, calcining of petroleum coke, conversion of uranium fluoride into uranium dioxide for the manufacture of nuclear fuel, and so on. When operated at atmospheric pressure, they consist of a cylindrical shell that can be inclined, into which the solid charge is fed continuously at one end and discharged at the other. They can be equipped with lifting flights or lifters, and/or dam(s) at the kiln end(s). They are classified into two main heating modes: either directly heated or indirectly heated, depending on the heating source location with respect to the solid material. They usually require very little labor to operate. Heat transfer in rotary kilns is very complex and may involve the exchange of energy via all the fundamental physical transfer mechanisms that are, conduction, convection, and radiation. There has been a significant amount of studies dealing with this subject in the literature. Although many researchers studied the main phenomena occurring in the kiln, the heat transfer between the wall and particles is not yet well understood. Therefore, this study aimed at determining the wall-to-solids heat transfer coefficient. The effects of various operational parameters such as the filling degree, the rotational speed, <b>lifters</b> profile <b>as</b> well as the temperature set point at the outer wall on the mentioned heat transfer coefficient are also analyzed in this study. A series of experiments were carried out on a pilot scale rotary kiln at atmospheric pressure, whether or not equipped with lifters and fitted with dam at the outlet end. The experimental rotary kiln is externally heated by electrical resistance and equipped with thermocouples positioned at five cross-sections, in and outside along the kiln tube. These experiments aimed at recording the heating up of the wall, gas and solid particles after turning on the heating system until temperatures are stabilized; the afore-mentioned coefficient was determined from the temperature profiles measurements data for low and medium wall temperature set point. The bulk materials used was quartz sand (average size 0. 55 mm) with a narrow distributed size fraction. Furthermore, two shapes of lifters were compared to determine the influence of lifter and their geometry: straight lifters (SL) and rectangular lifters (RL). The other operational parameters mentioned were also varied so that a matrix of about 60 experiments (without including repeatability tests) was achieved. The solids temperature fluctuations after the start of the heating system can be considered as response of a first-order system, therefore characterized by a time constant. Results show that the time constant decrease with the temperature set point at the outer wall and the filling degree, but increase in presence of lifters. However for the two types of lifters used, the time constant remains of the same order of magnitude. Calculation of the heat transfer coefficient has been done from the overall heat balance ODE, its analytical solution and the time constant. The third method of calculation give results an order of magnitude greater than the first two but follow similar tendency. The heat transfer coefficient from wall to solids seems to decrease in presence of lifters and increase with the filling degree. The heat transfer coefficient also increases with the temperature set point at the outer wall as well as the rotational speed (for a constant filling degree) ...|$|R
