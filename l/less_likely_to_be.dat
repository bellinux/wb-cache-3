5|$|Most known Albertosaurus {{individuals}} were aged 14 {{years or more}} {{at the time of}} death. Juvenile animals are rarely found as fossils for several reasons, mainly preservation bias, where the smaller bones of younger animals were <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> preserved by fossilization than the larger bones of adults, and collection bias, where smaller fossils are <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> noticed by collectors in the field. Young Albertosaurus are relatively large for juvenile animals, but their remains are still rare in the fossil record compared with adults. It has been suggested that this phenomenon is a consequence of life history, rather than bias, and that fossils of juvenile Albertosaurus are rare because they simply did not die as often as adults did.|$|E

5|$|According to writer Devin Grayson, {{the amount}} of {{creative}} freedom allowed by editors in the portrayal of LGBT characters depends upon how popular and established a character already is. Long-standing characters that would require a retcon to change their sexuality are <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> shown as LGBT than newer characters. When such changes to a character's continuity are made, fans are often disgruntled, particularly when sexuality is involved, and Alan Moore suggests that creating a new character is preferable.|$|E
5|$|Flux-cored wire is {{considered}} to have some advantages for outdoor welding on-site, as the shielding gas plume is <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> blown away in a wind than shield gas from a conventional nozzle.

This molecule is not based on a peptide and has no obvious structural similarity to a protein substrate.

5|$|The oceans {{may have}} become more hospitable to life over the last 500million years and less {{vulnerable}} to mass extinctions: dissolved oxygen became more widespread and penetrated to greater depths; the development of life on land reduced the run-off of nutrients and hence the risk of eutrophication and anoxic events; marine ecosystems became more diversified so that food chains were <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> disrupted.|$|E
5|$|An injury {{at a lower}} {{point on}} the spine does not {{necessarily}} mean better sexual function; for example, people with injuries in the sacral region are <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to orgasm than those with injuries higher on the spine. Women with injuries above the sacral level have a greater likelihood of orgasm in response to stimulation of the clitoris than those with sacral injuries (59% vs 17%). In men, injuries above the sacral level are associated with better function in terms of erections and ejaculation, and fewer and less severe reports of dysfunction. This may be due to reflexes that do not require input from the brain, which sacral injuries might interrupt.|$|E
5|$|Gastroenteritis {{typically}} involves both {{diarrhea and}} vomiting, or less commonly, presents {{with only one}} or the other. Abdominal cramping may also be present. Signs and symptoms usually begin 12–72hours after contracting the infectious agent. If due to a viral agent, the condition usually resolves within one week. Some viral causes may also be associated with fever, fatigue, headache, and muscle pain. If the stool is bloody, the cause is <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> viral {{and more likely to}} be bacterial. Some bacterial infections may be associated with severe abdominal pain and may persist for several weeks.|$|E

5|$|Like other mouse lemurs, {{the gray}} mouse lemur uses {{what has been}} {{described}} as a harmonic whistle call that is lower in frequency and shorter in duration than its close relative, the brown mouse lemur. In addition, it has been found that the types of vocalizations emitted by the gray mouse lemur can be dependent upon the environment. In the more open dry forest habitats favored by the gray mouse lemur, trill calls are more common and effective since they carry faster and are <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> masked by the wind, while chirp calls are more common in the brown mouse lemur, which favors closed rain forest habitats.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{perpetrators}} of Nazi war crimes were never charged, and returned unremarked to civilian life. The West German Central Prosecution Office of Nazi War Criminals only charged about a hundred former Einsatzgruppe members with war crimes. And as time went on, it became more difficult to obtain prosecutions; witnesses grew older and were <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to offer valuable testimony. Funding for trials was inadequate, and the governments of Austria and Germany became less interested in obtaining convictions for wartime events, preferring to forget the Nazi past.|$|E
5|$|On a computer, if {{the result}} of an {{addition}} is too large to store, an arithmetic overflow occurs, resulting in an incorrect answer. Unanticipated arithmetic overflow is a fairly common cause of program errors. Such overflow bugs may be hard to discover and diagnose because they may manifest themselves only for very large input data sets, which are <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used in validation tests. One especially notable such error was the Y2K bug, where overflow errors due to using a 2-digit format for years caused significant computer problems in 2000.|$|E

5|$|The {{rules of}} {{baseball}} {{require that the}} official scorer view the game only from the press box, for two basic reasons. First, this ensures that every scorer has nearly the same perspective of the game. One of the intentions of this rule is to improve consistency in scorekeeping decisions between different official scorers working on different games at the same stadium, and between scorers in different stadiums. Second, the press box is the most neutral position within the stadium. Seated in the press box, the official scorer is surrounded by writers and broadcasters who are ostensibly neutral, and the scorer is <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unduly influenced by the players, the coaches, and the crowd.|$|E
5|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} a major {{contributor}} to female mortality in India. Indians account for 60% of the world's heart disease burden, despite accounting for less than 20% of the world's population. Indian women have a particular high mortality from cardiac disease and NGOs such as the Indian Heart Association have been raising awareness about this issue. Women have higher mortality rates relating to cardiovascular disease than men in India because of differential access to health care between the sexes. One reason for the differing rates of access stems from social and cultural norms that prevent women from accessing appropriate care. For example, it was found that among patients with congenital heart disease, women were <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> operated on than men because families felt that the scarring from surgery would make the women less marriageable.|$|E
5|$|In United States v. Daniel (1821), Chief Justice John Marshall {{recounted the}} history of tie-breaking methods on the circuit courts. If one judge or justice {{disagreed}} with the other two, the majority prevailed. If only one Supreme Court justice could attend, and a division arose between the district judge and the Supreme Court justice, the practiceas required by the Judiciary Act of 1793was to hold the case over until the next term. If a one-to-one division persisted with a different circuit riding justice, {{the opinion of the}} previous circuit rider broke the tie. After 1802, in cases where both judges sat, though, one-to-one divisions were <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> resolved by continuing the case until the next term because the circuit-riding justice would be the same (barring a change in membership on the Court).|$|E
