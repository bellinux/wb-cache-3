50|$|A gyrator is a passive, linear, lossless, two-port {{electrical}} network element proposed in 1948 by Bernard D. H. Tellegen as a hypothetical fifth <b>linear</b> <b>element</b> after the resistor, capacitor, inductor and ideal transformer. Unlike the four conventional elements, the gyrator is non-reciprocal. Gyrators permit network realizations of two-(or-more)-port devices which cannot be realized {{with just the}} conventional four elements. In particular, gyrators make possible network realizations of isolators and circulators. Gyrators do not however change the range of one-port devices that can be realized. Although the gyrator was conceived as a fifth <b>linear</b> <b>element,</b> its adoption makes both the ideal transformer and either the capacitor or inductor redundant. Thus the number of necessary linear elements is in fact reduced to three. Circuits that function as gyrators can be built with transistors and op amps using feedback.|$|E

Transect counts in 12 matched sets of semi-natural pastures, and <b>linear</b> habitat <b>elements</b> proximate and isolated from the pastures showed that population densities of M. jurtina and C. pamphilus were significantly higher in pastures and in linear habitats adjacent to these than in isolated <b>linear</b> <b>elements.</b> A mark-recapture study in a 2 x 2 km landscape indicated that individuals of all three species are able to reach even the isolated <b>linear</b> <b>elements</b> situated at least 1 km from the grasslands. For two of the species, A. hyperantus and C. pamphilus, analysis of the mark-recapture data revealed higher daily local survival rates in the semi-natural pastures and more individuals dispersing from pastures to <b>linear</b> habitat <b>elements.</b> The proportion of old compared to young individuals of C. pamphilus and M. jurtina were significantly higher in <b>linear</b> <b>elements</b> than in semi-natural pastures, which suggests that butterflies emerging in pastures subsequently dispersed to the <b>linear</b> <b>elements.</b> In combination, {{these results suggest that}} semi-natural pastures act as population sources, from which adult butterflies disperse to surrounding <b>linear</b> <b>elements.</b> Hence, preservation of the remaining fragments of semi-natural grassland is necessary to keep the present butterfly abundance in the surrounding agricultural landscape...|$|R

50|$|Because of the {{problems}} of identifying Volterra models other model forms were investigated as a basis for system identification for nonlinear systems. Various forms of block structured nonlinear models have been introduced or re-introduced. The Hammerstein model consists of a static single valued nonlinear element followed by a linear dynamic element. The Wiener model is the reverse of this combination so that the <b>linear</b> <b>element</b> occurs before the static nonlinear characteristic. The Wiener-Hammerstein model consists of a static <b>linear</b> <b>element</b> sandwiched between two dynamic systems, and several other model forms are available. All these models can be represented by a Volterra series but in this case the Volterra kernels take on a special form in each case. Identification consists of correlation based and parameter estimation methods. The correlation methods exploit certain properties of these systems, which means that if specific inputs are used, often white Gaussian noise, the individual elements can be identified one at a time. This results in manageable data requirements and the individual blocks can sometimes be related to components in the system under study.|$|E

An advantage of the slider potentiometer is that the slider position gives a visual indication of its setting.

50|$|A <b>linear</b> <b>element</b> of a {{structure}} {{is one that}} is essentially one dimensional and is often subject to axial loading only. When a structural element is subjected to tension or compression its length will tend to elongate or shorten, and its cross-sectional area changes by an amount that depends on the Poisson's ratio of the material. In engineering applications, structural members experience small deformations and the reduction in cross-sectional area is very small and can be neglected, i.e., the cross-sectional area is assumed constant during deformation. For this case, the stress is called engineering stress or nominal stress and is calculated using the original cross section.|$|E

The pipistrelle was observed almost entirely close to landscape elements, while serotines more frequently crossed fields and meadows.

On a landscape scale the results indicate a more than proportional positive {{relation between}} the density of serotine bats and the density of <b>linear</b> landscape <b>elements,</b> whereas this relation was only proportional {{in the case of}} the pipistrelle.
