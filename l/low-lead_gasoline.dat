5000|$|The famous [...] "Rocket" [...] V8 {{continued}} {{in several different}} sizes and power options, with both the large 455 and 'small-block' 350 available with either 2- or 4-barrel carburetors. This was {{the last year for}} the 250 cubic-inch six-cylinder engine, as it had not been a very popular offering in Olds intermediates. In 1971, all engines came from the factory with hardened valve seats, preparing for the upcoming mandate for unleaded gasoline that took effect with the introduction of catalytic converters on 1975 models.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to assess the effect of oxygenated hydrocarbons on the knocking characteristics of an engine when blended with <b>low-leaded</b> <b>gasoline.</b> Alcohols, ethers, esters and ketones were tested individually and in various combinations up to an oxygen content of 4 % wt/wt in a blend with Series F- 7 gasoline of 90, 92, 94 and 96 RON. Tests were carried out at wide open throttle, constant speed and standard timing setting. Engine speed was varied using a dynamometer and knock was detected by two piezoelectric transducers, one on the cylinder head monitoring all four cylinders and one monitoring the cylinder most prone to knock. The engine speeds associated with trace and light knock of a continuous nature were noted. Curves were produced for each oxygenate blend of base RON used against engine speed for the two knock conditions which were compared with those produced using pure Series F- 7 fuels. From this a suggested RON of the blend was derived. RON increase was less when using a higher RON base fuel in the blend. Most individual oxygenates showed similar effects in similar concentrations when their oxygen content was comparable. Blends containing more than one oxygenate showed some variation with methanol/MTBE/ 3 methylbutan- 2 -one and methanol/MTBE/ 4 methyl pentan- 2 -one knocking less than expected and methanol/MTBE/TBA also showing good knock resistance. Further tests to optimise initial findings suggested a blend of methanol and MTBE to be superior although partial replacement of MTBE by 4 methyl pentan- 2 -one resulted in a fuel of comparable performance. Exhaust emissions were tested for a number of oxygenated blends in 2 -star gasoline. 2 -star and 4 -star fuels were also tested for reference. All oxygenate blends reduced carbon monoxide emissions as expected and hydrocarbon emissions were also reduced. The largest reduction in carbon monoxide occurred using a 14. 5 % (1 : 1 : 1) methanol/MTBE/ 4 methyl pentan- 2 -one blend. Hydrocarbon emissions were most markedly reduced by a blend containing 25. 5 % 4 methyl pentan- 2 -one. Power output was tested for the blends and indicated a maximum increase of about 5 % at low engine speeds. The most advantageous blends were methanol/ 4 methyl pentan- 2 -one (6 : 5) 11 % in 2 -star and methanol/MTBE/ 4 methyl pentan- 2 -one (6 : 3 : 2) 11 % in 2 -star. In conclusion methanol/MTBE (6 : 5) and (5 : 5), and various combinations of methanol/MTBE/ 4 methyl pentan- 2 -one, notably (6 : 3 : 2) gave good results in all tests conducted. CFR testing of these blends showed them to increase both RON and MON substantially...|$|R
5000|$|In 1971, the Tempest {{nameplate}} was {{retired and}} Pontiac promoted the Le Mans nameplate to full-series status to identify {{all of its}} intermediate models, which still included the GTO. At {{the bottom of the}} line was the Pontiac T-37, previously known as the Tempest, and now expanded to include two- and four-door sedan along with the original hardtop coupe. The GT-37 option was available on both the two-door sedan (pillared coupe) or hardtop coupe. Engine offerings were carried over from 1970 and Pontiac's 455 cubic-inch V8 (offered only on GTOs in 1970) was now available as an option on all Pontiac intermediates in both base four-barrel with 325 horsepower or the 455 HO option with 335 horsepower. All 1971 engines were detuned with lower compression ratios to run on lower-octane regular leaded, <b>low-lead</b> or unleaded <b>gasoline.</b> Brakes were 9.5" [...] drums.|$|R
5000|$|The base Ambassador DPL {{model was}} canceled, with three body styles now {{available}} in SST and Brougham trim. Fleet purchasers could order plain Ambassadors in Police Pursuit Vehicle (PPV) or Special Service Package (SSP) versions. A six-cylinder engine was no longer available; thus, Ambassador became a V8-only car {{for the first time}} since 1964. This made the Ambassador the only volume-produced American car that included air conditioning, power brakes, automatic transmission, and a V8 engine as standard equipment; all while being priced less than the Big Three's full-sized cars. The base engine was the 304 CID L with two 360 CID L or a 401 CID L versions optional. The engines were designed to operate on regular grade, <b>low-lead,</b> or unleaded <b>gasolines.</b> All were based on the engine designs responsible for AMC winning the 1971-1972 Trans-Am Series.

2500|$|The {{standard}} 455 cubic-inch Rocket V8 {{was rated}} at [...] {{and designed to}} run on lower octane regular lead, <b>low-lead</b> or unleaded <b>gasoline</b> {{for the first time}} this year thanks to a General Motors-mandate that all engines be designed to run on such fuels in preparation for the catalytic converter equipped cars of 1975 and later years that absolutely required unleaded gasoline.

V8s were progressively detuned as production wore on in line with tighter emission standards.

In effect, it replaced the discontinued Executive between the lower-priced Catalina and the Grand Ville. The Bonneville was offered in three body styles, a pillared four-door sedan, four-door hardtop sedan and two-door hardtop coupe. The standard engine for 1971-72 was a 455 cubic-inch V8 with two-barrel carburetor that was rated at 280 gross horsepower for 1971 and 185 net horsepower for 1972 and optionally available was the four-barrel version of the 455 rated at 325 gross horsepower in 1971 and 250 net horsepower in 1972. The on-paper power ratings reflect the change in power measurement undertaken by the industry for 1972. 1971 {{was also the first}} year for Pontiac and other GM divisions to reduce compression ratios on all engines across the board in order to enable use of lower-octane regular leaded, <b>low-lead</b> or unleaded <b>gasoline,</b> thanks to a corporate edict in preparation for the introduction of catalytic converters in 1975 to help meet increasing stringent federal (and California) emission requirements.|$|R

Inside, the SS model got new [...] "European symbol knobs", and a four-spoke steering wheel became optional. Mechanically it was largely unchanged, although the small-block Turbo-Fire 400 two-barrel engine was dropped. Other engines had compression ratios lowered to allow the use of regular leaded, <b>low-lead,</b> or unleaded <b>gasoline,</b> per a GM corporate edict. Engine ratings fell to 245 hp (183 kW) for the base Turbo-Fire 350 CID (5.7 L) two-barrel, 270 hp (201 kW) for the Turbo-Fire 350-4V, and 300 hp (224 kW) for the Turbo-Jet 400.
