40|$|SummaryIntroductionFemoral stem {{revision}} with a <b>locked</b> <b>stem</b> after total hip arthroplasties treats severe bone defects by favoring spontaneous bone reconstruction. Initially, once reconstruction was obtained, {{the temporary}} implant {{was to be}} replaced by a standard primary component. The use of <b>locked</b> <b>stems</b> has increased, but repeat revision with a short stem which is also called “de-escalation” has not been extensively studied. HypothesisRepeat revision of a <b>locked</b> <b>stem</b> with a short stem is not associated with any specific morbidity and does not affect the quality of reconstruction obtained, or fixation of the subsequent standard length primary design stem. Patients and methodsFifteen patients whose <b>locked</b> femoral <b>stem</b> was exchanged due to thigh pain and/or radiographic images showing failed osteointegration were analyzed. These 15 patients were all followed-up and evaluated by the Postel Merle d’Aubigné score. Progression of bone defects was evaluated using the Hofmann cortical index. ResultsThere were no difficulties extracting the <b>locked</b> <b>stem</b> and a standard length primary stem was inserted with no associated procedures or bone complications in any of the cases. At a mean follow-up of 55 months (36 – 84 months), thigh pain had disappeared and the Postel Merle d’Aubigné score had increased from 12. 6 ± 2. 9 (7 – 16) to 16. 5 ± 0. 9 (15 – 18) (P= 0. 0001). The use of a <b>locked</b> femoral <b>stem</b> resulted in bone reconstruction in all cases, the Hofmann index increased from 30. 5 %± 17. 9 % (12 – 71 %) before insertion of the <b>locked</b> <b>stem</b> to 43. 6 %± 25. 6 % (19 – 90 %) at exchange (P< 0. 05). Bone reconstruction was durable after the exchange with a stable Hofmann index 43. 7 %± 26. 2 % (17 – 92 %) at the final follow-up (P= 0. 9). No recurrent loosening occurred. DiscussionRevision of a loosened <b>locked</b> femoral <b>stem</b> with a standard design primary stem does not result in any specific increased morbidity, or modify bone reconstruction obtained with the <b>locked</b> <b>stem</b> and results in stable fixation of a new standard length stem.

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the functional and radiological outcomes of a cementless, trauma-specific <b>locked</b> <b>stem</b> for 3 - and 4 -part proximal humeral fractures. 				 					Materials and methods: This study consisted of two parts: a cadaver study with 22 shoulders and a multicenter prospective clinical study of 23 fracture patients evaluated at least 2  years after treatment. In the cadaver study, the <b>locked</b> <b>stem</b> (HumelockTM, FX Solutions) and its instrumentation were evaluated. In the clinical study, five senior surgeons at four different hospitals performed the surgical procedures. An independent surgeon evaluated the patients using clinical (Constant score, QuickDASH) and radiological (X-rays, CT scans) outcome measures. 				 					Results: The cadaver study allowed us to validate the height landmarks relative to the pectoralis major tendon. In the clinical study, at the review, abduction was 95 ° (60 – 160), forward flexion was 108 ° (70 – 160), external rotation (elbow at body) was 34 ° (0 – 55), the QuickDASH was 31 (4. 5 – 59), the overall Constant score was 54 (27 – 75), and the weighted Constant score was 76 (31. 5 – 109). 				 					Discussion: This preliminary study of hemiarthroplasty (HA) with a <b>locked</b> <b>stem</b> found results that were at least equivalent to published series. As all patients had at least a 2 -year follow-up, integration of the <b>locked</b> <b>stem</b> did not cause any specific complications. These results suggest that it is possible to avoid using cement when hemiarthroplasty is performed for the humeral stem. This implant makes height adjustment and transosseous suturing of the tuberosities more reproducible...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundCementless <b>locked</b> femoral <b>stems</b> {{are used}} for {{revision}} surgery in patients with bone loss to induce spontaneous bone reconstruction, allowing subsequent replacement by a standard primary stem. The small number of patients and short follow-ups available to date preclude a valid assessment of this strategy. HypothesisAfter distally <b>locked</b> <b>stem</b> revision, replacement by a standard primary stem does not induce complications, {{and the quality of}} the bone reconstruction allows strong fixation of a regular primary stem. Materials and methodsWe retrospectively evaluated 29 patients in whom a distally <b>locked</b> femoral <b>stem</b> was replaced by a standard primary stem between 1998 and 2010 (cemented in 27, cementless in 2 cases). The reason for the procedure was stem breakage, stem migration, or thigh pain. Mean patient age was 63 years (range, 39 – 78 years). Outcomes were evaluated based on the Postel-Merle d’Aubigné [PMA] score and Harris Hip Score [HHS]. In addition, radiographs were obtained to assess prosthesis fixation and the Hofmann cortical index measured the bone reconstruction. ResultsThe distally <b>locked</b> <b>stem</b> was removed via a postero-lateral approach without femoral osteotomy in all the 29 cases. In one patient, an intra-operative fracture occurred during femoral preparation. Mean follow-up after the exchange procedure was 75 months (range, 3 – 188 months). Postoperative ccomplications occurred in 9 (32 %) patients and consisted of chronic infection in 2 patients (after 3 and 76 months), post-traumatic peri-prosthetic fractures treated with internal fixation in 3 patients (after 100, 138, and 182 months), aseptic loosening in 3 patients (after 13, 39, and 122 months), and recurrent instability in one patient (after 63 months). All cause revision stem survival after 75 months was 72 % (95 % confidence interval, 47 %– 87 %). In the 19 patients who still had their revision stem at last follow-up, the mean PMA score was 16. 7 (range, 13 – 18) and the mean HHS was 88. 2 (range, 59 – 99). The Hofmann index remained unchanged [36. 5 % (range, 28 %– 58 %) before the exchange and 32. 9 % (range, 20 %– 57 %) after the exchange; P= 0. 129]. DiscussionThis study confirms the feasibility of substituting a distally <b>locked</b> <b>stem</b> with a standard primary stem. No specific complications occurred and no technical difficulties arose when extracting the long stems. However, the 32 % complication rate and, more specifically, the occurrence of loosening in 10 % (3 / 29) of patients mandates caution in the use of this technique, which should not be proposed routinely, and suggests a need for considering cementless fixation of the standard primary stem.

This paper discusses only the pressure locking phenomenon in a flexible-wedge gate valve; we will publish {{the results of our}} thermal binding research at a later date. Pressure locking can occur when operating sequences or temperature changes cause the pressure of the fluid in the bonnet (and, in most valves, between the discs) to be higher than the pressure on the upstream and downstream sides of the disc assembly. This high fluid pressure presses the discs against both seats, making the disc assembly harder to unseat than anticipated by the typical design calculations, which generally consider friction at only one of the two disc/seat interfaces. The high pressure of the bonnet fluid also changes the pressure distribution around the disc in a way that can further contribute to the unseating load. If the combined loads associated with pressure locking are very high, the actuator might not have the capacity to open the valve. The results of the NRC/INEL research discussed in this paper show that the relationship between bonnet pressure and pressure <b>locking</b> <b>stem</b> loads appears linear. The results also show that for this valve, seat leakage affects the bonnet pressurization rate when the valve is subjected to thermally induced pressure locking conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} the correct {{evaluation}} of Q-factor appearing in Adler's equation for injection-locking is addressed. Investigation has shown that recent results presented in the literature, while extending applicability of the original method, do not completely account for nonlinear effects occurring when two-port active devices are involved. To overcome such limitation, use can be made of a newly developed theory in the dynamical complex envelope domain, capable of providing first-approximation exact dynamical models of driven quasi-sinusoidal oscillators. Some preliminary results are presented here concerning a class of injection-locked oscillators with single-loop feedback type configuration. The proposed procedure permits evaluation of the nonlinear oscillator Q-factor, either analytically or numerically, depending on {{the complexity of the}} nonlinear active device model involved. The example worked out, a MOST-equipped driven Colpitts scheme, clearly illustrates the accuracy improvement achieved in the determination of the <b>locking</b> bandwidth <b>stemming</b> from the newly defined effective Q-factor, without the need to resort to the very time consuming full numerical transient envelope simulations otherwise required to this purpose...|$|R
40|$|Revision total hip {{arthroplasty}} in {{the setting}} of a large proximal femoral deficiency or a peri-prosthetic fracture remains a challenging problem. We describe the development, surgical technique and the use of cementless revision stems with distal inter-locking screws to provide immediate stability of the femoral implant. Results were assessed in a large multicentre French study conducted with the french hip and knee surgery society (SFHG). We retrospectively reviewed 725 revisions using interlocking stems from 14 French orthopaedic departments. Seven different stems were used in this series. In-patient records were retrieved, and in addition to demographic data the indication for revision, the preoperative and postoperative PMA and Harris hip scores were documented. The bone deficiency was classified {{on the basis of the}} French National Orthopaedic Meeting (SOFCOT) classification. Intraoperative complications and problems if any were retrieved from operative notes. Clinical status and radiographs at the final follow-up were evaluated, paying special attention to the metaphyseal filling index. Average follow-up was 4. 5 years. As for the clinical results, the mean Harris hip score at last follow-up was 81. Therefore, it increased by an average of 31 points. Bone reconstruction was assessed on the cortico-medullary index in the metaphyseal area and at mid-shaft increasing from 36 to 45 and 54 to 63, respectively. Radiologically, 637 implants were stable, and 40 demonstrated subsidence. Forty-eight implants have been revised. We found a significant relation between the metaphyseal filling index, the stability of the stem and the quality of bone reconstruction. Results were analysed with respect to three groups of stems: group 1 was a straight, partially HA-coated implant; group 2 was a curved, fully HA-coated implant; and group 3 was a curved, partially-coated implant. Group 1 showed a significantly higher rate of failure when compared with the others types of implants. Group 2 had better functional results than group 3, which in turn reported better results than group 1. With regard to implant fixation, group 2 had significantly better results. Both groups 2 and 3 induced less thigh pain than group 1. The distal interlocking stem has shown promising results for femoral revisions. The advantages are initial axial and rotational stability and consistent bony in-growth owing to hydroxyapatite coating. Distal <b>locked</b> <b>stems</b> are mainly indicated to treat complex femoral revision with severe bone loss and peri-prosthetic fractures...|$|R
25|$|Early implant designs had the {{potential}} to loosen from their attachment to the bones, typically becoming painful ten to twelve years after placement. In addition, erosion of the bone around the implant was seen on x-rays. Initially, surgeons believed this was caused by an abnormal reaction to the cement holding the implant in place. That belief prompted a search for an alternative method to attach the implants. The Austin Moore device had a small hole in the stem into which bone graft was placed before implanting the stem. It was hoped bone would then grow through the window over time and hold the stem in position. Success was unpredictable and the fixation not very robust. In the early 1980s, surgeons in the United States applied a coating of small beads to the Austin Moore device and implanted it without cement. The beads were constructed so that gaps between beads matched the size of the pores in native bone. Over time, bone cells from the patient would grow into these spaces and fix the stem in position. The stem was modified slightly to fit more tightly into the femoral canal, resulting in the Anatomic Medullary <b>Locking</b> (AML) <b>stem</b> design. With time, other forms of stem surface treatment and stem geometry have been developed and improved.|$|R
40|$|Locking is {{a popular}} {{deflation}} technique followed by many eigensolvers, where a converged eigenvector is frozen and removed from the iteration search space. Other deflation techniques that do not modify the matrix have less favorable numerical properties, so the alternative to locking is not to perform deflation at all. Without deflation, which we refer to as non-locking, converged eigenvectors are kept in the search space. One {{of the goals of}} this paper is to determine when locking is computationally preferable, and for which eigensolvers. Our primary goal, however, is to address a subtle numerical, but not floating point, problem that arises with <b>locking.</b> The problem <b>stems</b> from the fact that converged eigenpairs are only accurate to a specified tolerance Tol, so if they are locked, they may impede convergence to Tol accuracy for some subsequent eigenvector. Although the problem is rare, the resulting stagnation is a liability for general purpose software. We provide a theoretical explanation of the problem, and based on it we derive an algorithm that resolves the problem, is easy to implement, and incurs minimal additional costs.

40|$|SummaryIntroductionWe {{report a}} {{continuous}} prospective series of patients operated on for total hip prosthesis femoral component loosening involving a bone defect. Reconstruction was performed using a hydroxyapatite-coated <b>locked</b> modular <b>stem.</b> The study's {{objective was to}} assess medium term clinical and X-ray results obtained with this original concept. Materials and methodsThe patients included received a REEF® (DePuy) femoral implant for aseptic loosening or loosening associated with a periprosthetic fracture. Implantation was systematically accompanied by an extended trochanteric osteotomy (ETO). Patients were followed up prospectively by clinical and X-ray examination. Their loosening was graded at inclusion according to Vives’ classification as revised by SOFCOT in 1999. Analysis focused on actuarial implant survivorship, dislocation and the bone/implant interface. ResultsForty-three hips were included: mean follow-up was 58. 2  months (12 – 92) and mean age at surgery was 72. 4  years (37 – 94). The main indications were severe bone loss rated grade III (n= 15) or IV (n= 16) according to the SOFCOT classification. There was one long-term failure, involving implant fracture secondary to nonunion of the femoral shaft. Mean Postel and Merle d’Aubigné (PMA) clinical assessment score increased from six preoperatively to 14. 5 at end of follow-up. X-ray analysis found no stem migration by end of follow-up. There was consistent consolidation of the ETO around the stem, except in one case of stem fracture which evolved into tight nonunion. In terms of metaphyseal integration, five patients showed radiolucency without evolution over follow-up, and eight had severe calcar cortical atrophy at end of follow-up. Mean 5 -year actuarial survivorship was 97. 7 ± 2. 3 %, with a 2 % incidence of dislocation. DiscussionThe complications rate was low, and results were comparable with those reported in the literature. The study confirmed {{the interest of the}} extended trochanteric osteotomy exposure and the effectiveness of the hydroxyapatite-coated interlocked modular stem concept in the treatment of hip prosthesis loosening with femoral bone loss (involving or not the cortex). On analysis, the one case of failure does not proscribe the surgical technique employed. Implant osseointegration was difficult to analyze. The extent of the surgical approach and of its corresponding sequels, combined with the complexity of adjusting the implant, however, restrict this surgical option indications to level III and IV cases of femoral loosening.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{highly efficient}} self-assembly of various catenanes and nano-sized cage-like structures by incorporating transition metal centers into their backbones. Catenanes are very curious compounds, named after Latin word: catena, {{which means a}} chain. As indicated by its name, two or more ring-compounds interlock each other to take a chain-like structure. Following the general review of metal-directed self-assembly and general summary of the thesis. Chapter 2 describes the quantitative formation of catenane compounds by the complexation of Pd(II) and some pyridine-based ligands. The catenane structure, revealed by X-ray diffractions, indicates that the two factors, interactions between aromatic rings {{and the structure of}} monomer rings, are quite important for [2]catenane formations. If the monomer frameworks have appropriate cavity with ca. 3. 5 Å surface-surface distance, the two monomers are spontaneously interlocked into [2]catenanes with aid of efficient CH-π and hydrophobic interactions. Other outstanding point is, in this chapter, the behavior as "molecular magic ring". Their strategy makes the [2]catenane structures from two pre-formed ring compounds, which can slippage into a catenane structure via transmetallation processes. This "Mobius strip" mechanism proposed here is also discussed. Labile coordinate bonds between metal centers [Pd(II) ] and pyridine rings (Py) make it possible to efficiently generate the catenanes. Components, metal centers and pyridine-based ligands, in a system are led to the most thermodynamically stable situations as the results of equilibration due to this coordinate bonds [Pd(II) -Py]. The other advantage point in the utilization of coordinate bonds is that each transition metals has unique properties on a length, strength, direction, and numbers of bonds between a metal center and a organic ligand. These properties make it useful to rationally design various well-defined structures. Many examples of well-defined structures are ascribed to the geometry or coordinate bonds. Charter 3 describes a new strategy based on pure coordination chemistry for constructing a 4 -crossing [2]catenane. A combination of two kinds of metal centers enabled us to obtain such a complex structure. The ligand used here contains a central 1, 10 -phenanthroline site attached to two pendent/ 4 -pyridyl groups. The central site is used to complex a copper(I) center, tetrahedral geometry, whereas the lateral pyridine groups are coordinated to palladium(II), square planar geometry. The stepwise complexation procedure is virtually quantitative. It can be carried out both ways (copper(I) followed by palladium(II) or reverse one). Interestingly, the complex is a chiral species incorporation 4 ligands, 2 copper(I) and 4 palladium(II) enters. The properties based on chirality are also mentioned. In contracts to geometries of coordination bonds, their strength should be also paid special attention. Normally, coordination bonds are classified into two parts, labile coordinate bonds and inert ones. In chapter 4, "a molecular lock" concept and its application to the synthesis of stable catenanes and square complexes. The molecular <b>lock</b> concept <b>stems</b> from the unique dual character of a Pt(II) -pyridine coordinate bond. That is, the Pt(II) -Py bond is inert under room temperature in watter. However the bond becomes labile in highly polar media at elevated temperature. Due to this behavior, the Pt(II) -Py coordinate bond can be locked and released and, hence, is likened to a lock. By the incorporation of this Pt(II) -Py bond or "molecular lock" into ring frameworks, the one-way formation of a [2]catenane is achieved. Application of molecular lock into the synthesis of kinetically stable tetranuclear square complex is also described. In chapter 5, the molecular lock concept is applied to the construction of a nano-sized cage complex. The reversibility of Pt(II) -pyridine coordinate bond can be controlled to labile bond from inert one by external stimuli. By incorporating Pt(II) -Py bond or "molecular lock" into the vicinity of cage structure, a kinetically stable nano-sized cage complex was obtained. A suitable guest molecule showed remarkable template effect for the generation of the cage compound. In addition, the assembled complex was revealed to have remarkable stability toward acidic or basic conditions...|$|R
