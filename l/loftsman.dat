50|$|Brendan Percival Hansen {{was born}} on 21 August 1922 in Maryborough, Queensland, the eldest son of Percy Hansen and Mary Ann (n√©e Rowley). His father, a {{shipwright}} by trade, had been Secretary of the Shipwrights Union in Brisbane and Maryborough, and {{was involved in the}} founding of the Queensland Council of Unions. Hansen was educated at the Granville State School and Christian Brothers College, Maryborough before becoming a shipwright and <b>loftsman</b> at the Walkers Limited shipyard. He joined the Labor Party in 1950 and served as Secretary of the Granville branch of the ALP.|$|E
5000|$|Charles Clifford Ogle (January 21, 1923 [...] - [...] c. August 12, 1964?) was an American {{businessman}} and aviator. Charles Ogle was a {{businessman and}} developer in Oakland, California, {{at the time}} of his disappearance. He had worked as a <b>loftsman</b> for the Tampa Shipbuilding Company in Tampa, Florida, before joining the U.S. Navy in 1943 during World War II where he received flight training in the CAA-WTS (Civil Aeronautics Administrative War Training Service). He also served on the USS John D. Ford. At the end of the war he worked as a securities salesman for the First California Company in Sacramento until 1950 when he joined the United States Marine Corps at the beginning of the Korean War. From 1954 to 1964 he was a developer and builder in the San Francisco Bay Area.|$|E
5000|$|The term lofting {{originally}} {{came from}} the shipbuilding industry where <b>loftsmen</b> worked on [...] "barn loft" [...] type structures to create the keel and bulkhead forms out of wood. This was then {{passed on to the}} aircraft then automotive industries who also required streamline shapes.|$|R
50|$|Ship design work, {{also called}} naval architecture, may be {{conducted}} using a ship model basin. Previously, <b>loftsmen</b> {{at the mould}} lofts of shipyards were responsible for taking the dimensions, and details from drawings and plans and translating this information into templates, battens, ordinates, cutting sketches, profiles, margins and other data. However, since the early 1970s computer-aided design (CAD) became normal for the shipbuilding design and lofting process.|$|R
50|$|Lofting is {{particularly}} useful in boat building, {{when it is}} used to draw and cut pieces for hulls and keels, which are usually curved, often in three dimensions. <b>Loftsmen</b> at the mould lofts of shipyards were responsible for taking the dimensions, and details from drawings and plans and translating this information into templates, battens, ordinates, cutting sketches, profiles, margins and other data.Since the early 1970s computer-aided design (CAD) became normal for the shipbuilding design and lofting process.|$|R
40|$|An {{algorithm}} is presented which {{is able to}} locate isolated bad points and correct them without contaminating {{the rest of the}} good data. This work has been greatly influenced and motivated by what is currently done in the manual loft. It is not within the scope of this work to handle small random errors characteristic of a noisy system, and it is therefore assumed that the bad points are isolated and relatively few when compared with the total number of points. Motivated by the desire to imitate the <b>loftsman</b> a visual experiment was conducted to determine what is considered smooth data. This criterion is used to determine how much the data should be smoothed and to prove that this method produces such data. The method utimately converges to a set of points that lies on the polynomial that interpolates the first and last points; however convergence to such a set is definitely not the purpose of our algorithm. The proof of convergence is necessary to demonstrate that oscillation does not take place and that in a finite number of steps the method produces a set as smooth as desired...|$|E

It is not within the scope of this work to handle small random errors characteristic of a noisy system, and it is therefore assumed that the bad points are isolated and relatively few when compared with the total number of points. Motivated by the desire to imitate the <b>loftsman</b> we conducted a visual experiment to determine what is considered smooth data by most people. This criterion is used to determine how much the data should be smoothed and to prove that our method produces such data. The method ultimately converges to a set of points that lies on the polynomial that interpolates the first and last points; however convergence to such a set is definitely not the purpose of our algorithm. The proof of convergence is necessary to demonstrate that oscillation does not take place and that in a finite number of steps the method produces a set as smooth as desired. The amount of work for the method described here is of order n. The one dimensional and two dimensional cases are treated in detail; the theory can be readily extended to higher dimensions...|$|E
