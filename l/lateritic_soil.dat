25|$|Warren has a hilly topography, {{caused by}} two factors: the {{underlying}} geology, {{which consists of}} infolded metamorphic rock of the Leeuwin Complex and Archaean granite of the Albany-Fraser Orogen; and the dissection of rivers such as the Blackwood, Warren, Shannon and Frankland. The western extent of the region takes in the Leeuwin Naturaliste Ridge, an 80 kilometre (50mi) long strip of coastal limestone {{on top of a}} ridge of granite, with an extensive cave system. There are a number of soil types, including hard setting loamy soil, <b>lateritic</b> <b>soil,</b> leached sandy soil and Holocene marine dunes.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the physical, chemical, and mineralogical composition of <b>lateritic</b> <b>soils</b> in order to use these soils as potential commercial products for industrial application in the future. Five <b>lateritic</b> <b>soils</b> derived from various parent materials in Taiwan, including andesite, diluvium, shale stone, basalt, and Pleistocene deposit, were collected from the Bt 1 level of soil samples. Based on the analyses, the Tungwei soil is an alfisol, whereas other <b>lateritic</b> <b>soils</b> are ultisol. Higher pH value of Tungwei is attributed to the large amounts of Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +. Loupi and Pingchen soils would be the older <b>lateritic</b> <b>soils</b> because of the lower active iron ratio. For the iron minerals, the magnetic iron oxides such as major amounts of magnetite and maghemite were found for Tamshui and Tungwei <b>lateritic</b> <b>soils,</b> respectively. Lepidocrocite was only found in Soka soil and intermediate amounts of goethite were detected for Loupi and Pingchen soils. After Mg-saturated and K-saturated processes, major amounts of mixed layer were observed in Loupi and Soka soils, whereas the montmorillonite was only detected in Tungwei soil. The investigation results revealed that the parent materials would play an important role during soil weathering process and physical, chemical, and mineralogy compositions strongly affect the formation of <b>lateritic</b> <b>soils...</b>|$|R

30|$|In general, the <b>lateritic</b> <b>soils</b> in {{the study}} area are {{yellowish}} to brown-reddish in color and contain high percentage of iron oxides as discussed later. These pigmentations are consistent with the observation of De Graff-Johnson (1972) and Tardy (1992) on the <b>lateritic</b> <b>soils</b> formed under oxidized conditions and good drainage. Their strong pigmentation may also indicate the good aggregation of the soils due to their strong surface charge properties (Tardy 1992).|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} <b>lateritic</b> <b>soils</b> to remove {{fluoride}} from {{water has been}} studied. Important issues considered in the study include {{the relation between the}} mineral composition of soils and their ability to remove fluoride, the effect of thermal treatment of the soil on fluoride removal; the predominant fluoride containing species remain in the treated water and the possible mechanism of fluoride removal by <b>lateritic</b> <b>soils.</b> The fluoride removal capacity of thermally treated <b>lateritic</b> <b>soils</b> used in this study is in the range of 22 to 47 mmol/kg. The maximum capacity of 47 mmol/kg was obtained for RGS fired at 500 o C. The results obtained indicate that there is strong correlation between fluoride removal capacity and gibbsite content of the soil. From this it can be concluded that gibbsite is the active component in <b>lateritic</b> <b>soils</b> that strongly influence the fluoride removal capability. Speciation analysis reveals that at low initial fluoride concentrations the dissolution of gibbsite is facilitated by the adsorption of fluoride onto gibbsite. This may result in the formation of aluminum fluoro complexes in water. DOI: [URL]...|$|R

40|$|This {{systematic}} {{soil survey}} covers {{an area of}} about 50, 000 sq. km, that consists of marshes, coastal plains, hills and mountains. Soils were classified as dry-land soils, marsh soils and peat soils, and subdivided as Residual and Sedimentary soils. Most soils are derived from liparitic, dacitic and andesitic volcanic rocks. All soils are influenced by recent fertile volcanic ash, which had rejuvenated these soils. Only 8 % of the area was cultivated; most land was covered with tropical rain- forest.
