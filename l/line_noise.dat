5|$|In 1991, Oslo Sporveier {{presented}} plans {{involving a}} rapid transit circle line in Oslo, connecting the newly built hospital Rikshospitalet {{with the rest}} of the city. A detailed suggestion was presented by Oslo Sporveier in August 1996. In the local newspaper Aftenposten Aften there was a debate on whether there should be a ring line from Berg along the National Road 150 towards Gaustad over Rikshospitalet, or whether the Ullevål Hageby Line should be extended from John Colletts plass to Rikshospitalet, thereby creating a correspondence with the Sognsvann Line at the new station Forskningsparken. In the first plans, Berg was meant to be a station on the new ring line. This plan was discarded since local residents feared noise pollution and destroyed lawns. Even though Berg was not made a station on the Ring <b>Line,</b> <b>noise</b> shields were put up along the Sognsvann Line.|$|E

2500|$|A typical {{complete}} filter {{will consist of}} a number of Zobel sections for roll-off, frequency dips and temperature followed by a flat attenuator section to bring the level down to a standard attenuation. [...] This is followed by a fixed gain amplifier to bring the signal back up to a usable level, typically 0dBu. [...] The gain of the amplifier is usually no more than 45dB maximum. [...] Any more and the amplification of <b>line</b> <b>noise</b> will tend to cancel out the quality benefits of improved bandwidth. [...] This limit on amplification essentially limits how much the bandwidth can be increased by these techniques. [...] It {{should also be noted that}} no one part of the incoming signal band will be amplified by the full 45dB. [...] The 45dB is made up of the line loss in the flat part of its spectrum plus the basic loss of each section. [...] In general, each section will be minimum loss at a different frequency band, hence the amplification in that band will be limited to the basic loss of just that one filter section, assuming insignificant overlap.

Adaptive noise removal is a technique which could be employed for removing line frequency without degrading the desired signal. In this paper <b>line</b> frequency <b>noise</b> has been eliminated on-line from a nuclear power measuring channel. The adaptive LMS algorithm has been used to cancel 50 Hz noise.

As a result the location of image points, the orientation of image lines and the length and orientation of image motion vectors are estimated erroneously. It is suggested that machine vision systems processing video should include statistical procedures to alleviate the bias.
