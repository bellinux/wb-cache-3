40|$|Agricultural <b>land</b> <b>packers</b> are {{generally}} used following the seeding operation. It {{has been found}} that fields which have been packed usually give higher yields than those which have not been packed, although the reasons for this result are not understood. A laboratory study was undertaken to determine the effect of packing and the effect to determine the effect of packing and the effect of packer weight on soil density and moisture loss. A soil bin system was designed and constructed for the proposed study. The bulk density of the soil in the box was measured with a gamma ray density system. A 12 -inch cultivator shovel was used to till the soil before packing. Two agricultural <b>land</b> <b>packers,</b> a crowfoot and a coil type were used to pack the soil. Four different weights of packers ranging from 60 pounds to 160 pounds per foot of width were used for both packers at three depths of cultivation and at two moisture levels. Based upon the theoretical analysis of gamma transmission, a linear relationship was found between the count rate and the moisture content, and between the count rate and the dry bulk density. These relationships were used in determining the undisturbed bulk density of soil. It was found that the packed density of the soil was essentially the same for all packer weights used. No differences in packed density were detected with changes in depth of cultivation, moisture level, or the type of packer. The packed density increased with depth. Based upon these results an equation of packing was developed which related packed density to Depth. Experimental results were then checked against the theoretical calculations based upon a pressure-sinkage equation. Laboratory compaction tests and consolidation tests were carried out with a Proctor density apparatus and a consolidation apparatus respectively. The results from the compaction tests were compared with the experimental values. The Bossinesq equation was used to draw iso-pressure curves. Densities were calculated by graphical integration of iso-pressure curves using the density-pressure relationship obtained from the consolidation tests. A comparison was made between the densities obtained graphically and experimentally. The trend of calculated values was {{similar to that of the}} experimental values to a depth of four inches. A comparison of the moisture loss from a sample of soil which was cultivated only to that from a sample which was cultivated and packed showed no difference during a period of seven days...|$|R

Known as [...] "Skook" [...] or [...] "Skookum" [...] Davidson {{because of his}} stature (big and strong), he is the namesake of Mount Skook Davidson and the Liard River landing Skooks Landing was so-named because it was where he would arrange to have supplies dropped for his Flying J Ranch, which lay up the Kechika River 150 miles from there. He moved to Vancouver in 1972 following a fire at the ranch. [...] The location is near Fireside, British Columbia and near it is an old construction camp used by crews building the Alaska Highway, the route of which he helped discover.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this article, adapted from the book Building the Beef Industry, is to summarize the 100 -yr history of the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association. Because {{the activities of the}} Association through the years largely parallel major developments in the beef industry, this is essentially a history of beef production in the United States. Early cattle industry leaders recognized that many problems—and opportunities—could be better addressed by working in concert with other cattle producers. Yet free-spirited cattle producers, known for their individualism and independence, were difficult to organize. Two attempts at national associations failed before the National Live Stock Association, organized in 1898, sustained and after several name changes became the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association. Some challenging areas that demanded cooperation by producers included roundups on the open range, disease control or eradication, development of export markets, restriction of competing imports, continued access to public <b>lands,</b> restrictions on <b>packer</b> monopoly and collusion, limited government help, resistance to government price controls and beef boycotts by consumers, expanded beef research, and self-help beef promotion. The oldest issue for western cattle producers has been the public domain. The “biggest cattle deal ever ” was the government purchase-andslaughter program in 1934, when 8. 3 million cattle were slaughtered, reducing the cattle population by 11 %. A “transportation revolution ” occurred when the railroads put trail drivers out of business; when trucks put the railroads out of the business of transporting cattle; when local auction markets, made viable by trucks and trailers, put terminal markets out of business; an...|$|R
