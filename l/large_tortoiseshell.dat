6000|$|At {{that time}} the portrait, in colours, of the great man {{occupied}} the post of honour above the mantelpiece in our sala, or drawing-room-- {{the picture of a}} man with fine clear-cut regular features, light reddish-brown hair and side-whiskers, and blue eyes; he was sometimes called [...] "Englishman" [...] on account of his regular features and blonde complexion. That picture of a stern handsome face, with flags and cannon and olive-branch--the arms of the republic--in its heavy gold frame, was one of the principal ornaments of the room, and my father was proud of it, since he was, for reasons to be stated by and by, a great admirer of Rosas, an out-and-out Rosista, as the loyal ones were called. This portrait was flanked by two others; one of Dona Encarnacion, the wife, long dead, of Rosas; a handsome, proud-looking young woman with a vast amount of black hair piled up on her head in a fantastic fashion, surmounted by a <b>large</b> <b>tortoiseshell</b> comb. I remember that as small children we used to look with a queer, almost uncanny sort of feeling at this face under its pile of black hair, because it was handsome but not sweet nor gentle, and because she was dead and had died long ago; yet it was like the picture of one alive when we looked at it, and those black unloving eyes gazed straight back into ours. Why did those eyes, unless they moved, which they didn't, always look back into ours no matter in what part of the room we stood?--a perpetual puzzle to our childish uninformed brains.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Lavender {{entered a}} room {{which had a}} {{considerable}} resemblance {{to the office of}} a lawyer save for the absence of tomes. It seemed furnished almost exclusively by the Minister, who sat with knees crossed, in a pair of <b>large</b> round <b>tortoiseshell</b> spectacles, which did not, however, veil the keenness of his eyes. He was a man with close cropped grey hair, a broad, yellow, clean-shaven face, and thrusting grey eyes.|$|R
50|$|The Ngatik {{massacre}} {{took place}} over two days of fighting on the atoll of Sapwuahfik in the Micronesian island chain in July 1837. Captain C. H. Hart and his crew of beachcombers of the Lampton from Sydney, Australia, massacred as many as 50 Sapwuafihk men. Hart had hoped to raid what he believed was a <b>large</b> stash of <b>tortoiseshell</b> on the island.|$|R

40|$|Loop {{took place}} at the Bankfield Museum in Halifax, an {{important}} museum and archive of textile history, housed in an industrialist’s mansion and curated by June Hill ([URL] The Loop exhibition was curated by Jane Langley, also curator of Spin (see outcome 1), and continued Spin’s area of research and investigation. I worked g closely with June Hill, curator at Bankfield, in the development of two works: a sculptural object and a wall piece. I was struck by Victorian assemblages of insects in glass domes and repeated use of butterfly and moth motives in textile decoration and design. On further investigation these depictions varied in accuracy, in terms of anatomical observation and species location from precision to wild exaggeration. Importantly, they also depicted landscape scenes that have vastly changed through human intervention or agricultural practice. ‘Golden Oldies’, is a work that reacts to scenes of pastoral success and patterns of equilibrium often found in floral design. It displays, on a prong of steel, four extinct British butterfly species. The work continued my focus on landscape in the investigation of specific sites and species. The <b>Large</b> <b>Tortoiseshell</b> species, for example, was made extinct when the ‘introduction’ of Elm disease led to the destruction of its larval food plant; hence ‘eaten out of town’. The Large Copper butterfly lived on the East Anglia fenlands and as habitats were drained this species also declined beyond recovery. The exhibition was opened with a public discussion of the works with the artists, curator, museum director and representatives from the Northern Arts Council. It was accompanied by a catalogue and essay by Janis Jefferies, Professor of Visual Art at Goldsmiths College: ‘Loop’ (ISBN No 1 85924 2855). Press articles are also available online ([URL]...|$|E
