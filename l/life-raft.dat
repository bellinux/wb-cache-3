After helping to free a <b>life-raft,</b> Sheean was wounded by two bullets. He {{made his way to}} the aft Oerlikon 20mm cannon and began to fire on the Japanese aircraft to protect those in the water. Sheean managed to shoot down one of the Japanese bombers, but was killed when Armidale sank. Many of the survivors credited their lives to Sheean and he was posthumously mentioned in despatches. In 1999, the submarine HMAS Sheean was named in his honour, and efforts have been made to have Sheean belatedly awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia.|$|E

60|$|The {{state of}} feeling in {{governmental}} circles, and the evidences of alarm and distrust which were becoming apparent in Congress {{and among the}} people, exerted an important influence in favour of the Syndicate. The Government caught at its proposition, not {{as if it were}} a straw, but {{as if it were a}} <b>life-raft.</b> The men who offered to relieve the executive departments of their perilous responsibilities were men of great ability, prominent positions, and vast resources, whose vast enterprises had already made them known all over the globe. Such men were not likely to jeopardize their reputations and fortunes in a case like this, unless they had well-founded reasons for believing that they would be successful. Even the largest amount stipulated to be paid them in case of success would be less than the ordinary estimates for the military and naval operations which had been anticipated; and in case of failure, the amount forfeited would go far to repair the losses which might be sustained by the citizens of the various States.|$|E

60|$|I {{will not}} trouble you with details {{of those three}} terrible days and nights when we drifted helplessly about {{at the mercy of}} the {{currents}} on our improvised <b>life-raft</b> up and down the English Channel. The first night was the worst. Slowly after that we grew used to the danger, the cold, the hunger, and the thirst. Our senses were numbed; we passed whole hours together in a sort of torpor, just vaguely wondering whether a ship would come in sight to save us, obeying the merciful law that those who are utterly exhausted are incapable of acute fear, and acquiescing in the probability of our own extinction. But however slender the chance--and as the hours stole on it seemed slender enough--Hilda still kept her hopes fixed mainly on Sebastian. No daughter could have watched the father she loved more eagerly and closely than Hilda watched her life-long enemy--the man who had wrought such evil upon her and hers. To save our own lives without him would be useless. At all hazards, she must keep him alive, on the bare chance of a rescue. If he died, there died with him the last hope of justice and redress.|$|E

Following the final incursion, Black Swan and the Cabal awoke in their <b>life-raft</b> when it landed on the patchwork planet called Battleworld. While Black Swan and the Cabal were fighting the Thor Corps, Sheriff Strange released the survivors of Earth-616 from their <b>life-raft</b> in hopes that they would confront the Cabal.

Black Swan was with God Emperor Doom's family when it came to the battle between Battleworld's inhabitants and God Emperor Doom's forces. When Black Swan confronted Star-Lord near the World Tree and defeated him, she was caught by surprise when Star-Lord managed to turn the World Tree into Groot, who defeated her.|$|E

5000|$|On 19 October, as {{the convoy}} {{approached}} the British Isles, Mackinnon sighted a U-boat 100 yards ahead. Assyrian went full ahead to ram her, making 10 knots {{for the first}} time in recent memory and chasing the enemy ship for 40 minutes. However, Assyrians main gun was astern, she was unable to bring any of her small guns to bear, and slowly the U-boat drew away. Now ahead of the convoy, with no escorts around, the old ship was vulnerable. Two torpedoes missed her but a third caught her on the starboard side stopping the engines and putting out her lights. Both ship's boats were damaged in the explosion and most of the surviving crew took to the <b>life-rafts.</b> A sinking merchantman drifted down upon the Assyrian, her pit props rolling off and further damaging the ship and sinking one of the <b>life-rafts</b> which had been launched. A small group including the ship's Master, the Chief Officer and Mackinnon were stranded aboard the sinking ship. They set to building a raft out of whatever they could find and launched it as the ship went down. The raft fell to bits as it hit the water. Mackinnon, then 58, went into the cold North Atlantic. He swam to a plank and hung on. The [...] found him at the very end of his strength, unable to swim or grasp a rope. They hoisted him aboard in a net.|$|R
