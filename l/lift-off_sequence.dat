5|$|A {{technical}} director worked out {{that to make}} Carl's house fly, he would require 23million balloons, but Docter realized that number made the balloons look like small dots. Instead, the balloons created were made to be twice Carl's size. There are 10,927balloons for shots of the house just flying, 20,622balloons for the <b>lift-off</b> <b>sequence,</b> and a varying number in other scenes.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{reports on}} carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNT) arrays grown on patterned catalysts by plasma-enhanced {{chemical vapor deposition}} (PECVD). CNT growth has been performed by low pressure high-density plasma process at 700 C in acetylene/ammonia mixture. Prior to CNT growth, a standard lift-off process {{has been used for}} catalyst patterning. The chemical impact of the <b>lift-off</b> <b>sequence</b> on the catalyst activity is discussed with respect to the amount of Ni pre-deposited. In particular, it discusses the impact of this wet treatment on CNT growth when the catalyst amount is lower than a threshold value...|$|E
40|$|We propose {{plasmonic}} Sierpinski gasket, a self-replicating fractal, with {{structural elements}} spanning from similar to 100 nm to similar to 5 mu m made by standard {{electron beam lithography}} (EBL), metal deposition, and <b>lift-off</b> <b>sequence.</b> Such structures demonstrate light field enhancement from visible to far-IR spectral range and can be scaled up towards THz band. Numerical simulations show that as the fractal order is increased, the optical extinction band broadens from the visible light towards far-IR, achieving a light field enhancement of more than four orders of magnitude in the nano-gap proximity. Such antennas are prospective for IR-THz filter, detection, and emission applications. (C) 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinhei...|$|E
50|$|The {{model of}} the Eagle used in filming was built in four scales: {{by the end of}} the series, there were three 44 in Eagle models, two 22 in Eagles, one 11 in Eagle, and a 5 in Eagle. The {{superstructure}} framework was composed of brass tubing on the larger-scale models and the command module was fiberglass, with landing gear pods made of a wooden core with Perspex cladding. Compressed freon streams were used to portray the vertical jets used in <b>lift-off</b> and landing <b>sequences</b> and, in Year Two, the exhaust from the main rockets. The special effects team worked in Bray Studios, a separate studio away from where the live action filming took place.|$|R
40|$|Quantification of {{subjectivity}} {{is essential to}} have a consistent quality in prints for further analysis of rocket lift-off view printed images. An experimental mathematical model has been derived to quantify the human visual response vis a vis print process controls in rocket <b>lift-off</b> view <b>sequence</b> photography. Subjective evaluation data of eight professional printing technicians was collected using pairwise comparison. They gave 16 kinds of evaluations for each print. Their data consistency was checked by the process clustering of the subjects and qualified for taking as a quantification model {{for the analysis of}} perception in print quality. After trying multi variant analysis and judgmental analysis, {{it was found that the}} problem is fuzzy in nature and involves multiple linkages and hence human like response is required. Hence, neural network model was selected which works on a simplistic non-linear weighted averages attached to inputs projected from dynamic modification of the target to reach the target output. The interdependency in the factor analysis output is linked up in a feed forward neural network. The 16 th attribute of the data evaluation (overall preference) parameter is taken as output. The inter linkages of the possible explanation from the contributors of the remaining parameters is explained by the performance of the neural network. The positive correlation of the factors confirms the data with that of the nationally acclaimed professional colour printing laboratory expert’s opinion...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{fabricate}} and characterise nanometer structures, silicon wafers were implanted with masks ranging from several m down to 200 nm in lateral dimensions. The masks were produced by an electron beam lithography, metal deposition and metal <b>lift-off</b> <b>sequence.</b> 10 keV 75 As+-ions were implanted to a fluence of 2. 5  1014 cm- 2 to create nanometer-sized doped and undoped volumes. Characterisation of the ion-implanted patterns {{was carried out}} by etching away the metal masks and subsequently using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning capacitance microscopy (SCM) images of the patterns. The simultaneous AFM and SCM measurements gave sharp contrasts between implanted and unimplanted regions, showing highly resistive swelled structures. The swelling also showed structure with a concave shape for implanted regions and a convex shape for unimplanted regions, which is most probably a result of damage evolution from the implantation...|$|E
