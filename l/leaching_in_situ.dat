40|$|Abstract. Driven by the world’s {{thirst for}} energy, {{the demand for}} uranium is rapidly increasing. Hence, {{producers}} of uranium are struggling {{to keep up with}} demands and are exploring more cost-effective methods of extraction. Uranium is currently mined via open pit and underground mining as well as with <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>leaching</b> methods, with <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>leaching</b> currently accounting for approximately 45 % of total uranium production. Studies have shown that the presence of uranium in soils strongly affects the composition and function of resident microbial communities. In view of the close association of biological processes and uranium geochemistry, it is surprising how little information is available on the effect of microbial communities on <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>leaching.</b> Hence, this review focuses on the possibility to exploit the properties of such microorganisms and identify opportunities to use natural microbial processes to improve uranium recovery and mine site rehabilitation...|$|R

In this study, {{the presence of}} some organic substances is identified from government-held CSG water-quality data from the Bowen and Surat Basins, Queensland. These records revealed the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in 27 % of samples of CSG water from the Walloon Coal Measures at concentrations < 1 µg/L, {{and it is likely}} these compounds <b>leached</b> from <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> coals. PAHs identified from wells include naphthalene, phenanthrene, chrysene and dibenz[a,h]anthracene. In addition, the likelihood of coal-derived organic compounds leaching to groundwater is assessed by undertaking toxicity leaching experiments using coal rank and water chemistry as variables. These tests suggest higher molecular weight PAHs (including benzo[a]pyrene) leach from higher rank coals, whereas lower molecular weight PAHs leach at greater concentrations from lower rank coal. Some of the identified organic compounds have carcinogenic or health risk potential, but they are unlikely to be acutely toxic at the observed concentrations which are almost negligible (largely due to the hydrophobicity of such compounds). Hence, this study will be useful to practitioners assessing CSG water related environmental and health risk...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{decision}} by the Department of Energy to pursue a hybrid option for the disposition of weapons plutonium has created {{the need for additional}} facilities that can examine and characterize waste forms that contain Pu. This hybrid option consists of the placement of plutonium into stable waste forms and also into mixed oxide fuel for commercial reactors. Glass and glass-ceramic waste forms {{have a long history of}} being effective hosts for containing radionuclides, including plutonium. The types of tests necessary to characterize the performance of candidate waste forms include: static leaching experiments on both monolithic and crushed waste forms, microscopic examination, and density determination. Frequently, the respective candidate waste forms must first be produced using elevated temperatures and/or high pressures. The desired operations in the glovebox include, but are not limited to the following: (1) production of vitrified/sintered samples, (2) sampling of glass from crucibles or other vessels, (3) preparing samples for microscopic inspection and monolithic and crushed static leach tests, and (4) performing and analyzing <b>leach</b> tests <b>in</b> <b>situ.</b> This paper will describe the essential equipment and modifications that are necessary to successfully accomplish the goal of outfitting a glovebox for these functions...|$|R

Bureau of Mines has {{developed}} tomographic computer programs for geophysical applications and is distributing them {{as part of}} a Bureau plan to facilitate the transfer of technology to potential users.

The Bureau has also applied them to assessing high-wall blast damage and examining the integrity of mine-related geological structures. This report describes the curved ray program BOMCMTR (Bureau of Mines curved ray tomographic reconstruction), tells how to run it, and gives examples with synthetic and field data. BOMCRATR provides optional mathematical constraints to counteract the nonuniqueness of tomographic reconstructions with crosshole data. These constraints include limiting the maximum and minimum velocities, fixing the velocity at any point to any value, and establishing layers in which velocity does not vary with horizontal position. The user can test for nonuniqueness by varying the initial velocity pattern, The program can perform either curved or straight ray analysis. Ray paths are calculated analytically in triangular pixels, which is faster than incremental numerical approximations...|$|R
40|$|Natural uranium (U) {{occurs as}} {{a mixture of}} three {{radioactive}} isotopes: 238 U, 235 U, and 234 U. Only 235 U is fissionable and makes up about 0. 7 % of natural U, while 238 U is overwhelmingly the most abundant at greater than 99 % of the total mass of U. Prior to the 1940 s, U was predominantly used as a coloring agent, and U-bearing ores were mined mainly for their radium (Ra) and/or vanadium (V) content; {{the bulk of the}} U was discarded with the tailings (Finch et al., 1972). Once nuclear fission was discovered, the economic importance of U increased greatly. The mining and milling of U-bearing ores {{is the first step in}} the nuclear fuel cycle, and the contact of residual waste with natural water is a potential source of contamination of U and associated elements to the environment. Uranium is mined by three basic methods: surface (open pit), underground, and solution mining (<b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>leaching</b> or <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> recovery), depending on the deposit grade, size, location, geology and economic considerations (Abdelouas, 2006). Solid wastes at U mill tailings (UMT) sites can include both standard tailings (i. e., leached ore rock residues) and solids generated on site by waste treatment processes. The latter can include sludge or ‘‘mud’’ from neutralization of acidic mine/mill effluents, containing Fe and a range of coprecipitated constituents, or barium sulfate precipitates that selectively remove Ra (e. g., Carvalho et al., 2007). In this chapter, we review the hydrometallurgical processes by which U is extracted from ore, the biogeochemical processes that can affect the fate and transport of U and associated elements in the environment, and possible remediation strategies for site closure and aquifer restoration. This paper represents the fourth in a series of review papers from the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) on geochemical aspects of UMT management that span more than three decades. The first paper (Landa, 1980) in this series is a primer on the nature of tailings and radionuclide mobilization from them. The second paper (Landa, 1999) includes coverage of research carried out under the U. S. Department of Energy’s Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action Program (UMTRA). The third paper (Landa, 2004) reflects the increased focus of researchers on biotic effects in UMT environs. This paper expands the focus to U mining, milling, and remedial actions, and includes extensive coverage of the increasingly important alkaline <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> recovery and groundwater restoration...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{effects of}} support {{calcination}} temperature, an important catalyst synthesis parameter, {{on the overall}} performance of the supported catalyst [silica ES 70 –nBuSnCl 3 /MAO/(nBuCp) 2 ZrCl 2], polymerizing ethylene without separately feeding the MAO cocatalyst, were studied. The silica was calcined at 250, 450, 600, and 800 8 C for 4 h. nBuSnCl 3 was used to functionalize the silica. Ethylene was polymerized using the synthesized catalysts at 8. 5 bar(g) in hexane for 1 h. No reactor fouling was observed. Free-flowing polymer particles with bulk density (0. 23 – 0. 27 g/ml) and a fairly spherical morphology {{similar to that of}} the catalyst particles were obtained. Also, the particle size distribution of the polymer resembled that of the catalyst. Therefore, the replication phenomenon from catalyst to polymer took place. The narrow PSD span (1. 41) indicates that the resulting polyethylenes are suitable for various mixing-intensive polymer applications. The MAO cocatalyst-free ethylene polymerization instantaneously formed a polymer film around the catalyst particle, which coated/immobilized the catalyst constituents; this is how <b>leaching</b> was <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> prevented which favored heterogeneous catalysis to occur. The catalysts showed fairly stable polymerization kinetics. The catalyst activity, as a function of the silica calcination temperature, varied as follows: 250 8 C > 600 8 C > 800 8 C > 450 8 C. This finding has been explained considering the relevant surface chemistry phenomena. The calcination temperature did not significantly affect the bulk density and the PDI (3. 4 PDI 3. 8) of the resulting polyethylenes. The low PDI substantiates the retention of single-site catalytic behavior of the experimental supported catalysts. # 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|Lead (Pb) {{and zinc}} (Zn) {{smelters}} produce high amount of granulated slags which are currently stored on unconfined slag heaps and exposed to weathering. The environmental risk related to slags disposals {{can be estimated}} through {{the results of a}} variety of characterization methods coupled with laboratory <b>leaching</b> experiments and <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> monitoring. The present study is focused on the Raman characterization and distribution at a microscopic scale of secondary products resulting to the alteration of glassy slags exposed to natural weathering for at least ten years. The slag alteration is characterized by the formation of a crack network around iron sulfide inclusions and Pb droplets embedded in the glassy matrix. The Raman images clearly point out the gradually weathering processes. The dissolution of the FeS species lead to the formation of Fe (oxy-hydr) oxide phases. The successive layer formation highlights a probable local pH/Eh changes. The fluids-containing sulfates issued from the alteration of sulfide species are conveyed in the crack network inducing a local alteration of the crack edges together with the formation of (Al,Fe) -hydroxide phases. The fluids-containing sulfates when in contact with Pb droplets induce a progressive dissolution of the droplets from the edge to the core to form Pb sulfate species (mainly basic lead sulfates) and Pb oxides in complex mixture. In a last step, carbonation occurs with local increasing pH due to the presence of CO 2 from air or HCO 3 - /CO 3 2 − in fluids originating from glassy matrix alteration...|$|R
