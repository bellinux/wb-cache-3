25|$|Outstanding debts became heavier, because {{prices and}} incomes fell by 20–50% but the debts {{remained}} at the same dollar amount. After the panic of 1929, and during the first 10 months of 1930, 744 U.S. banks failed. (In all, 9,000 banks failed during the 1930s). By April 1933, around $7 billion in deposits had been frozen in failed banks or those left unlicensed after the March Bank Holiday. Bank failures snowballed as desperate bankers called in loans which the borrowers {{did not have time}} or money to repay. With future profits looking poor, capital investment and construction slowed or completely ceased. In the face of bad loans and worsening future prospects, the surviving banks became even more conservative in their <b>lending.</b> <b>Banks</b> built up their capital reserves and made fewer loans, which intensified deflationary pressures. A vicious cycle developed and the downward spiral accelerated.|$|E

40|$|This paper uses panel data on banks, for {{the period}} 1991 - 98, to test the {{existence}} of a banklending channel in the Spanish economy.

Second, we analyse the response to an exogenous deposit-reducing shock (a taxinduced shift from deposits to mutual fund shares).

We estimate {{the effects of a}} negative shock to banks'' capital/assetratio on lending standards, which in turn affect consumer credit, mortgages, and corporate loans, and the corresponding components of private spending (consumption, residential investment and business investment). In addition, our empirical model allows for feedback from spending and income to bank capital adequacy and credit. Hence, we trace the full credit cycle. An exogenous fall in the bank capital/asset ratio by one percentage point reduces real GDP by some 1 Â½ percent through its effects on credit availability, while an exogenous fall in demand of 1 percent of GDP is gradually magnified to around 2 percent through financial feedback effects.
