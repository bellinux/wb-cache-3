5|$|The Nclass was {{designed}} by Maunsell in 1914 to provide a sturdy mixed-traffic locomotive with high route availability. Intended to replace several obsolete 0-6-0 types, the Nclass {{was the first step}} in the SECR's fleet standardisation programme, which also included the Kclass 2-6-4T passenger tank locomotive. Maunsell enlisted the help of former GWR engineer Harold Holcroft, who suggested that a 2-6-0 wheel arrangement would allow the class to run on the poor-quality track in north Kent. This arrangement allowed for a longer wheelbase with <b>leading</b> <b>axle</b> to permit greater stability at speed on tight track curves, which had constrained the size of locomotives operating on the SECR. A longer locomotive could also accommodate a larger boiler than an 0-6-0, giving the Nclass sufficient power to avoid double-heading of locomotives on heavier trains.|$|E
5|$|The 2-6-4 wheel {{arrangement}} {{was not in}} common use in Great Britain at this time, as many railway companies operated routes that required locomotives with greater fuel capacity, or short branch lines that necessitated smaller locomotives. The 2-6-4 tank engine design had only been used once before for standard gauge locomotives in Britain, on the Great Central Railway's 1Bclass freight locomotives of 1914. However, the configuration was ideal for the SECR, because of its shorter mainlines, and allowed for a long wheelbase with a <b>leading</b> <b>axle</b> to permit greater stability at speed on track curves. The tightness of the curves on the former LCDR mainlines had constrained the size of locomotives operating on the SECR, {{as they had been}} hastily erected during the nineteenth century to compete with those of the South Eastern Railway (SER). The longer locomotive could also accommodate a larger boiler than a 4-4-0, giving sufficient power to avoid double-heading of locomotives on heavier trains.|$|E
25|$|The key {{constraint}} in {{this approach}} was that it had limited traction because of the single driver. These locomotives were equally characterized by both axles, powered or unpowered, being of equal size. Even though the locomotive had the 2-2-0 designation, the <b>leading</b> <b>axle</b> was unpowered and not a lead truck.|$|E
5000|$|Two front <b>leading</b> <b>axles</b> grouped in a bogie, four driving axles, one {{trailing}} axle in a bogie, simple steam expansion, superheated steam, three-cylinders, for fast trains.|$|R
50|$|In the {{notation}} a locomotive with two <b>leading</b> <b>axles</b> (four wheels) in front, then three driving axles (six wheels) {{and then one}} trailing axle (two wheels) is classified as 4-6-2.|$|R
5000|$|A {{locomotive}} {{with two}} bogies, each with two <b>leading</b> <b>axles</b> and three individually powered axles. A number of Japanese electric locomotives used this wheel arrangement, including the JNR Class EF58, and the PRR GG1.|$|R
25|$|Two 2-4-0 {{passenger}} locomotives {{were built}} at Lochgram in 1877, followed by three 2-4-0 tank engines in 1878/9 for shunting and branch line duties. The tank engines were rapidly converted to 4-4-0s after {{problems with the}} <b>leading</b> <b>axle.</b> After two of the earlier 2-4-0 locomotives had been successfully converted into 4-4-0 for the Dingwall & Skye Railway, nine of the 4-4-0 'Skye Bogie' Class were built between 1882 and 1901. Eight 4-4-0 tender locomotives for main line services were built in 1886 by Clyde Locomotive Co., and a small 0-4-4 saddletank was built at Lochgorm for the Strathpeffer branch in 1890. The 'Strath' Class followed, twelve 4-4-0 locomotives built by Neilson in 1892 for the main-line, to an enlarged form of Jones' standard design. In 1892, Dübs & Co. sold the Highland two 4-4-0 tank engines that had been built for the Uruguay Eastern Railway but not delivered. These were followed by three more in the following year, and these locomotives were used on branch lines.|$|E
25|$|The next {{thoroughly}} {{new type}} was the TS6 from January 1933; this {{had all the}} improvements afforded to the contemporary TD3 Titan, including the neater front radiator and bonnet assembly, but the same wheelbase and overall-length as the TS1. For operators requiring 30ft long single–decks a TS6D or TS6T Tiger was made available from 1934, the TS6D was 6x4 and the TS6T 6x2 with only the <b>leading</b> <b>axle</b> in the rear bogie powered. The TS7 and TS8 (and three-axled variants) were similarly derived from the TD4 and TD5 Titans, adopting their features. The suffix c (e.g., TS8c) indicated a torque-converter transmission. The TS9 and TS10 Tigers were never released for sale but the TS11 was equivalent to the TD7 Titan and very few were built, most during World War II, during that war the SMT group of bus companies in Scotland converted many of their two and three-axle Tigers to Titan specification and fitted double-deck 55-seat bodies to them.|$|E
500|$|The Kclass design used a [...] "Bissel bogie" [...] <b>leading</b> <b>axle</b> and a plain {{trailing}} bogie. The trailing bogie {{permitted the}} use of a large coal bunker that was capable of sustaining the locomotive over the run between London Charing Cross and , and side water tanks of [...] capacity were used, negating the need for a tender. The coupled wheelbase between the rear and centre driving wheels was reduced from that used on the mechanically identical Nclass to [...] to accommodate the bogie. The cab was fully enclosed, although the set of four small front spectacle plates (the windows on the front face of the cab for forward visibility) were the same as those used on the Nclass.|$|E
50|$|In {{spite of}} their {{relatively}} simple design Klien-Lindner axles were not widely used. Derailments were common when they were used as <b>leading</b> <b>axles.</b> The axles often caused uneven, jerky running {{as a result of}} the resistance forces that arise from this type of Cardan joint, and they were expensive to maintain, something which was not offset by the reduced wear and tear on wheel flanges and rails.|$|R
50|$|The {{first digit}} {{corresponds}} {{to the number of}} <b>leading</b> unpowered <b>axles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Standard {{practice}} in the United Kingdom was to use the Whyte notation for steam locomotives. The Southern Railway used a system modified from the UIC method: Oliver Bulleid, the Chief Mechanical Engineer, numbered his 4-6-2 Battle of Britain class Pacifics 21C XXX, referring to <b>leading</b> <b>axles,</b> trailing axles and powered axles, UIC classification 2′C1′, Whyte 4-6-2.|$|R
500|$|In May 1925 Maunsell {{ordered a}} further ten {{locomotives}} from Brighton works (Nos.A800–A809), which only had vacuum brakes for the SECR stock on the Eastern section. They were delivered between July and December 1926. This group had modified suspension on the bogie and <b>leading</b> <b>axle,</b> {{in an attempt}} to address complaints from the crews of rough riding experienced with earlier members of the class. A further 20 members of the class were ordered in March 1926 (ten each from Ashford and Brighton works), despite strong reservations expressed by the Operating Department concerning [...] "the wisdom or desirability of placing so many large passenger tanks in service". These were allocated the numbers A610A629, and work had begun on building the frames and cylinders when the order was cancelled following an accident at Sevenoaks in 1927 involving locomotive No.A800. These numbers were later allocated to the first production batch of Uclass locomotives.|$|E
2500|$|Valve gear {{was of the}} low-maintenance Baker type, with (of course) power reverse. A {{front-end}} throttle was installed, {{with the}} distinctive linkage running along the boiler on the engineer's side. [...] A mechanical lubricator, driven from the crosshead on the engineer's side, fed oil to the cylinders, valves, guides {{and other parts of}} the running gear. Many of the locomotives were fitted with a speedometer, which was attached to the engineer’s side frontmost <b>leading</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|E
50|$|They were rebuilt as 4-4-0Ts in 1881-82 due {{to trouble}} with the single <b>leading</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|E
5000|$|After 1958, these {{locomotives}} were gradually {{converted to}} mixed fuel oil and coal firing, {{which resulted in}} improved steaming ability and better performance, particularly on mountainous lines. During their 35 years of service, they exhibited excellent performance and only minor problems were experienced, such as oval wearing of the <b>leading</b> <b>axle's</b> inside crank. After factory repair, one of these locomotives, no. 03.12, was preserved in the depot at Gorna Oryahovitsa and returned to operation for tourist trains.|$|R
2500|$|From 1900, the GNR {{adopted a}} system of {{classification}} based on a locomotive's wheel arrangemenent (using the Whyte Notation), with each arrangement being represented by a letter. Initially, the letters A to J were allocated in ascending order of driving axles and descending order of <b>leading</b> <b>axles.</b> Letters K to O were allocated later as new types were introduced and A was re-used once all the 4-2-2 locomotives had been withdrawn. The full list of letters used was as follows: ...|$|R
50|$|Most early {{electric}} locomotives shared commonalities with the steam engines of their time. These features included side rods and frame mounted driving <b>axles</b> with <b>leading</b> and trailing <b>axles.</b> The long rigid wheelbase and the <b>leading</b> and trailing <b>axles</b> reduced cornering stability and increased weight.|$|R
5000|$|One front <b>leading</b> <b>axle</b> in a bogie, four driving axles, {{saturated}} steam, four-cylinder machine, compound (double steam expansion), {{for passenger}} trains.|$|E
50|$|The Prussian Class P 6s were {{passenger}} locomotives {{operated by}} the Prussian state railways with a <b>leading</b> <b>axle</b> and three coupled axles.|$|E
5000|$|One front <b>leading</b> <b>axle</b> in a bogie, five driving axles, one rear {{trailing}} axle, simple steam expansion, superheated steam, two-cylinder machine, for freight trains, tank engine.|$|E
50|$|The {{high-pressure}} cylinder was outside {{and drove the}} middle coupled wheels, whilst the inside low-pressure cylinders drove the <b>leading</b> coupled <b>axle.</b> These two cylinders were slightly angled.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first of}} three {{locomotives}} based on these specifications, named John Stevens, was completed in 1849. Dripps wasn't too sure that the locomotive would prove effective on American railroads, and his reservations {{turned out to be}} correct. The locomotive's tractive effort was not sufficient for long term or heavy work. With only one driving axle and three unpowered <b>leading</b> <b>axles,</b> too much of the locomotive's weight was distributed over the unpowered lead three axles. Almost a century passed before a six-wheel leading truck was used again, on the PRR S1 and S2.|$|R
50|$|A major {{disadvantage}} of the Mark I mount {{was that the}} weight was distributed forward, placing weight on the <b>leading</b> <b>axles</b> that was above the normally allowable weight for French railways, and also caused axle bearings to overheat at any speed over 5-10 mph. The armored enclosed gun house lacked ventilation and caused condensation to form, which promoted rusting. The necessity to excavate a recoil pit was also not acceptable as a long-term solution of recoil control. Hence the Mark I, while functioning as designed, was seen as only a compromise measure necessitated by wartime time constraints.|$|R
5000|$|No front <b>leading</b> <b>axle,</b> four driving axles in a bogie, {{four more}} driven axles {{mounted in the}} frame (Mallet locomotive), {{superheated}} steam, four-cylinder machine, compound (double steam expansion), tank locomotive, for freight trains.|$|E
50|$|Between 1934 and 1941 a {{total of}} 691 G 8.1s were fitted with a <b>leading</b> <b>axle</b> {{in order to allow}} a higher top speed and to reduce the average axle load. The {{converted}} locomotives were redesignated as DRG Class 56.2-8.|$|E
50|$|Although {{examples}} {{were built}} {{as early as}} 1852-53 by two Philadelphia manufacturers, Baldwin Locomotive Works and Norris Locomotive Works, these first examples had their leading axles mounted directly and rigidly on {{the frame of the}} locomotive rather than on a separate truck or bogie. On these early 2-6-0 locomotives, the <b>leading</b> <b>axle</b> was merely used to distribute the weight of the locomotive over a larger number of wheels. It was therefore essentially an 0-8-0 with an unpowered <b>leading</b> <b>axle</b> and the leading wheels did not serve the same purpose as, for example, the leading trucks of the 4-4-0 American or 4-6-0 Ten-Wheeler types which, at the time, had been in use for at least a decade.|$|E
50|$|The chassis and {{bodyshell}} {{were built}} at the Bean works in Tipton. There were three axles and eight tyres. The two <b>leading</b> <b>axles</b> steered and were of varying track, so that each tyre ran on a clean surface rather than following a rut. The driven rear axle used twin tyres to reduce the load on them, a technique already used by Bluebird. Separate panels of polished silver Birmabright, a new aluminium alloy, clad the chassis. The body never had the aerodynamic refinement of the Railton Special and was distinctly blocky in appearance. At the rear was a large triangular tailfin, flanked {{by a pair of}} hydraulically activated air brakes.|$|R
50|$|After the abolishment {{of control}} of living space in 1960, Hans Kampffmeyer, {{the head of the}} social {{democratic}} planning department developed the concept of decentralising the inner city. The adjacent boroughs were to become an extension of the Westend. The so-called Fünf-Fingerplan of 1967 designated that through the Westend five <b>leading</b> <b>axles</b> - Mainzer Landstraße, Bockenheimer Landstraße, Reuterweg, Grüneburgweg and Eschersheimer Landstraße - should be developed under an intensive construction plan. From this came a wave of property speculation, numerous nineteenth century building were demolished in the following years, their long established tenants driven out by rough methods. Several hundred houses stood empty in the Westend of 1970, often in completely shabby condition.|$|R
5000|$|... "1B-1B" [...] {{means there}} are two trucks with a <b>leading</b> idler <b>axle</b> in front of two powered axles. This {{arrangement}} was used to upgrade the B-B arrangement of two EMC 1800 hp B-B locomotives owned by the Santa Fe Railroad in 1938, for greater stability at speed.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had a superheated, four-cylinder, {{compound engine}} and a bar frame, {{like most other}} Bavarian four-cylinder compounds, which simplified access to the inside driving gear. All four cylinders drove the second coupled axle. The <b>leading</b> <b>axle</b> was of the Adams type.|$|E
50|$|The DRB Class 50 is a German {{class of}} 2-10-0 locomotive, built from 1939 as a {{standard}} locomotive (Einheitsdampflokomotive) for hauling goods trains. It had one <b>leading</b> <b>axle</b> and five coupled axles {{and was one of}} the most successful designs produced for the Deutsche Reichsbahn.|$|E
5000|$|The Railway Inspectorate {{found that}} the <b>leading</b> <b>axle</b> of the {{locomotive}} had fractured and questioned both {{the use of a}} [...] "goods locomotive" [...] on passenger work, where they would travel at higher speeds than usual, and the locomotive having no leading bogie wheels.|$|E
50|$|A letter {{indicates}} {{the number of}} driving axles. Number of either <b>leading</b> and trailing <b>axles</b> or axles of tenders is disregarded.|$|R
2500|$|... "1B-1B" [...] {{means there}} are two trucks with a <b>leading</b> idler <b>axle</b> in front of two powered axles. [...] This {{arrangement}} was used to upgrade the B-B arrangement of two EMC 1800 hp B-B locomotives owned by the Santa Fe Railroad in 1938, for greater stability at speed.|$|R
50|$|There is {{similarly}} {{no evidence to}} support the claims that they had problems in service which led to their alleged demotion from express passenger use. The design of the fire grate and ash pan was very similar to, for example, the later Gresley K3 2-6-0s, and their fireboxes were deep and relatively large for their 26.5 sq ft grate area. Overheating troubles with axleboxes have been alleged, related to the large force from the inside cylinders. Robinson in fact took care to make the coupled boxes as large as possible, 9 x 9 in on the two <b>leading</b> <b>axles</b> and 8 x 12 in on the trailing set. In fact a more likely source of initial trouble was the marine-type big ends fitted to the first five, since the sixth reverted to strap and cotter type.|$|R
