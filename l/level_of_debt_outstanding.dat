40|$|The {{existing}} literature on international debt has analyzed {{the effects of}} different policies on the <b>debt</b> servicing problems <b>of</b> developing countries and these policies range from depreciation of the nominal exchange rate to creation of an export oriented trade regime. In a dynamic setting, this article analyzes the effects of yet another policy measure, namely creation of Free Trade Zones (FTZ), on the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>outstanding</b> <b>debt</b> <b>of</b> an economy. Our analysis shows that in the short run, if skilled labour is {{a substitute for the}} imported input and foreign capital in the FTZ, then production incentives to the FTZ through reduction in tariff rate on the imported input used by this zone (while maintaining the rate {{for the rest of the}} economy) reduce the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>outstanding</b> <b>debt.</b> In the long run, however, the effect of giving additional incentives to the FTZ on the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>outstanding</b> <b>debt</b> crucially depends upon one additional factor namely, the responsiveness of fiscal deficit to the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>outstanding</b> <b>debt.</b> The welfare <b>of</b> the country may also improve due to creation of an FTZ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{investigate}} the influence of political uncertainty, surrounding the Australian federal election cycle, on financial market uncertainty. Measures of political uncertainty are constructed and their relationship with market uncertainty, as measured by implied volatility, explored.

An increasing likelihood of the incumbent party, whose economic policies are presumably well-known, winning the election, reduces market uncertainty.

30|$|So far, firm {{valuation}} models {{capture the}} firm’s chosen refinancing/adjustment policy by offering two simple types of “debt policies” or “financing policies”. 3 The first policy assumes future debt levels {{to be certain}} (non-stochastic) [(see, Modigliani and Miller 1958) and 1963 henceforth termed MM)], whereas the second policy rests on certain leverage ratios based on market values <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> and equity (see, e.g., Miles and Ezzell 1980 and 1985; Harris and Pringle 1985) henceforth termed ME). When assuming constant absolute <b>debt</b> <b>levels</b> (in case <b>of</b> MM) and constant leverage ratios (in case of ME), both policies reflect different frequencies for the adjustment <b>of</b> the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>outstanding</b> <b>debt</b> towards future changes in firm value. Kruschwitz et al (2007) allow for {{a combination of the}} two policies and analyze a “hybrid” financing policy shifting one time from a MM policy towards a ME policy.

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{in this chapter}} establishes that while commercial Islamic finance is not yet formally practiced in Libya, most businesses have at least some knowledge about Islamic methods of finance. We can partly attribute this awareness to both knowledge of developments in other Muslim countries and {{to the fact that}} many commercial products and services offered by Islamic financial institutions bear close relation to informal financing and business arrangements already practiced among Muslims. These include Musharakah (full partnerships) and Quard Hassan (interest-free loans), with the latter practiced personally by about one-fifth of all business respondents. We find many firms are predisposed to Islamic finance, but those that do generally have less business experience, are smaller in terms of assets and the number of employees, have lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>outstanding</b> <b>debt</b> and fewer owners. In fact, only 5. 1 % of potential user firms have assets in excess of LYD 500, 000 compared to 73. 0 % of firms that are not potential users, and no potential user has liabilities exceeding LYD 200, 000.

40|$|Four Ugandan banks, {{including}} three domestic banks, were closed between September 1998 and May 1999 because of imprudent banking practices. This paper uses a unique bank-firm matched data set {{to estimate the}} effect of losing a banking relationship on firm performance. Employing a fixed effects difference-in-differences estimation that controls for unobservable firm heterogeneity, I find that firms that lost a banking relationship declined by 10 - 15 % relative to unaffected firms over the three years following the crisis. This result is robust to reverse causation; for a fairly well identified subset of firms, I find no evidence of firm decline causing banking failure. I investigate two potential explanations of this result: the information and looting views of relationship lending. I find evidence for both views for mutually exclusive sub-samples. Insider firms experience the sharpest decline in employment relative to all affected firms. The insider effect persists even after controlling for the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>outstanding</b> <b>debt</b> to failed banks. I interpret this {{as evidence of the}} looting view. In the set of potential non-looting firms, I find that older affected firms have larger declines in employment relative to younger affected firms. In addition, affected firms that do not produce hard information have the largest declines in employment relative to other affected firms. Moreover, affected firms that produce hard information have the same growth rate as unaffected firms. Finally, affected firms are more likely to report being credit constrained in the post crisis period. I interpret this as evidence for the information view...|$|R
40|$|A long-standing and {{fascinating}} puzzle in economics is {{the understanding of}} the determinants that make some countries poor while other rich. This question can be summarized by the following quote, taken from the Lucas' essay On the Mechanics of Economic Development, which reads as follows Is there some action a government of India could take that would lead the Indian economy to grow like Indonesia's or Egypt's? This thesis, from a macroeconomic perspective, has not the ambition to provide a full and clear answer to the above mentioned issues. Rather, it attempts to give a partial but sensible contribution dealing with two dierent but deeply intertwined topics. The first chapter studies the interplay between infrastructure, informality and high skilled migration through a macroeconomic model which aims to de- pict a developing stylized country. In fact, infrastructure and human capital are two widely recognized key ingredients to achieve development. Large informal sector and substantial high skilled migration ows characterize developing countries eventually preventing both infrastructure and human capital accumulation. Two dierent frameworks are considered. In the rst one high skilled migration ows are left exogenous to the model while in the second one the brain drain phenomena is fully accounted by the model. Theoretical results are derived along with dynamical properties of the model. Subsequently, the model is calibrated for 60 countries. Numerical experiments show that the informal sector slows down the infrastructure accumulation process while helping low skilled to escape from extreme poverty. A quantitative assessment of a bench- mark restrictive scal policy suggests that, in the long run, an increase in the tax rate would be benecial for high skilled individuals without worsening the welfare of low skilled individuals. The results are robust to the brain drain mechanism accounted. In the second chapter sovereign debt crisis are the object of the study. Initially, a brief review of the literature on sovereign debt crisis is provided, in light of the OLG model developed in the second part. I assume that the government default choice leads to a permanent drop in productivity and as a result, the government's choice is driven by a cost-benet analysis. It has been proved that when the economy starts with an initial <b>level</b> <b>of</b> capital lower than a threshold, the government nds it protable to bankrupt. As a consequence, the model predicts that economies with the same <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>outstanding</b> <b>debt</b> but dierent initial capital levels can have dierent default behaviors suggesting that developing countries may be credit constrained. </br...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{identifies the}} impact of various political institutions on public finance decisions in the United States. The particular institutions covered are the local voter initiative process, mayoral term limits, and political party allegiances; I utilize various econometric techniques to identify how each of these institutions influences the fiscal decisions at the state or municipal levels. Chapters 2 and 3 provide two different approaches to identifying {{the effects of the}} local initiative. The initiative process influences policy directly as citizens are able to implement their desired policies; however, the threat of initiative also has the potential to influence the policies that elected officials will pass. In Chapter 2, I explain the history and utilization of the local initiative in California. In particular, I identify the factors that are associated with citizen initiatives, and thus a stronger threat of citizen action. Using data from local elections and initiaitives in California, I find that a strong political majority increases the probability of bringing a citizen initiative to the ballot; the presence of a majority increases the probability of success. Racial diversity leads to an increase in governance initiatives; these areas have more diverse preferences and are thus more likely to be dissatisfied with governance, on average. These cities cannot agree on the specific policies they prefer (they propose no more tax, land use, or initiatives of other categories), but they can agree to limit the powers of government. I also find that the use of the local initiative does not lead to significantly altered fiscal outcomes. The exception to this is that governance initiatives are associated with higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>outstanding</b> <b>debt</b> and interest obligations, even when controlling for racial diversity and income. Chapter 3 provides a direct test of whether the availability of the local voter initiative and recall processes and term limits influences municipal fiscal decisions in the United States. Using an adaptation of the Campbell-Mankiw (1990) model of forward-looking decision making, I find that the threats of voter initiative and recall do not significantly influence local fiscal policies. This suggests that voter preferences and local fiscal policy are aligned in the absence of these institutions. Term limits lead to increased short-sighted decision making, by removing officials' accountability to voters. This effect is roughly equivalent to removing almost all access to municipal borrowing. The analysis improves upon previous studies of US municipal fiscal policy by utilizing a panel of annual observations of government fiscal choices between 1970 and 2004 for more than 500 local jurisdictions. In doing so, the research design identifies the extent to which cities act according to a rational tax-smoothing model or are short-sighted in their fiscal decision making over time. In addition to term limits, large and diverse populations are associated with short-sighted fiscal policies. Chapter 4 applies the probabilistic voting model to construct a measure of party allegiance for jurisdictions in the United States. This political score isolates underlying voter preferences from characteristics that uniquely influence each election and is used to test the core and swing voter hypotheses of intergovernmental transfers. I find that party ties are important determinants of state-to-local transfers in the North- eastern United States and in California. In particular, when Democrats gain seats in state legislatures, they tend to reward their core constituencies. In California, Democrats also reward swing constituencies. When Republicans gain seats in state legislatures, they reward swing constituencies...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the theory}} of debt-deflation, a key cause of {{economic}} crises is a high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt,</b> and a key cause of recovery from crises is when this debt level has decreased. Other than repayment (paying down debt) and default (not paying it), a key mechanism <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> reduction is inflation - because debts are general in nominal terms, inflation reduces the real <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt.</b> This effect is more pronounced the higher the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt,</b> {{in proportion to the}} <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt.</b> For example, if the debt to GDP ratio of a country is 300% and it experiences one year of 10% inflation, the debt level will be reduced by approximately [...] to 270%.

This estimation procedure has the advantage of quantifying the threshold <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> as compared to the ad hoc classification procedure of splitting the sample. Findings ‐ The results show that debt is only pertinent to the firm value up to a threshold <b>level</b> <b>of</b> 64. 33 per cent.
