25|$|Affected {{individuals}} can exhibit growth retardation, short stature, premature graying of hair, hair loss, wrinkling, prematurely aged faces, beaked noses, skin atrophy (wasting away) with scleroderma-like lesions, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> tissues, abnormal fat deposition leading to thin legs and arms, and severe ulcerations around the Achilles tendon and malleoli.

50|$|A {{major feature}} is {{lipodystrophy}} (a reduction in fat under the skin). The characteristic changes in facial appearance occur from the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> from the cheeks, {{and around the}} eyes. Dry eyes {{and the failure to}} close eyes during sleep can be a feature due to the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> around the eyes (rather than any excessive prominence of the eyeballs). Limbs appear very thin due to lack of fat storage and also reduced muscle mass. There is a large amount of fat within the abdominal cavity which, can be particularly marked in the liver (but not always) and surrounds the other organs. A major result of the lipodystrophy in some people is severe insulin resistance so insulin does not work very well leading to diabetes and high triglyceride levels in the blood. The effect of insulin resistance can be variable and may relate to progression of the lipodystrophy or may reflect variation between individuals.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} manifestations <b>of</b> body <b>fat</b> {{redistribution}} are accumulations <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> {{in the central}} body in the form <b>of</b> a <b>fat</b> pad {{on the back of}} the neck and an accumulation <b>of</b> visceral <b>fat</b> in the abdomen or belly.

50|$|The protein encoded by {{this gene}} is a zinc finger {{transcription}} factor.PRDM16 controls the cell fate between muscle and brown <b>fat</b> cells. <b>Loss</b> <b>of</b> PRDM16 from brown fat precursors causes a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> brown <b>fat</b> characteristics and promotes muscle differentiation.|$|R
50|$|Nesfatin-1 is a neuropeptide {{produced}} in the hypothalamus of mammals. It participates in the regulation <b>of</b> hunger and <b>fat</b> storage.

50|$|Lipoatrophy is {{the term}} {{describing}} the localized <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> tissue. This may occur {{as a result of}} subcutaneous injections of insulin in the treatment of diabetes, from the use of Human Growth Hormone or from subcutaneous injections of Copaxone used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. In the latter case, an injection may produce a small dent at the injection site. Lipoatrophy occurs in HIV-associated lipodystrophy, one cause of which is an adverse drug reaction that is associated with some antiretroviral drugs.|$|E
50|$|Other {{hormones that}} prevent the {{stimulation}} of lipogenesis in adipose cells are growth hormones (GH). Growth hormones result in <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> but stimulates muscle gain. One proposed mechanism {{for how the}} hormone works is that growth hormones affects insulin signaling thereby decreasing insulin sensitivity and in turn down regulating fatty acid synthase expression. Another proposed mechanism suggests that growth hormones may phosphorylate with STAT5A and STAT5B, transcription factors that {{are a part of}} the Signal Transducer And Activator Of Transcription (STAT) family.|$|E
50|$|WR is {{associated}} with abnormalities in bone maturation, and lipids and hormone metabolism.

50|$|This gene {{represents}} a candidate gene for human lipodystrophy, characterized by <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> body <b>fat,</b> fatty liver, hypertriglyceridemia, and insulin resistance.

5000|$|Lipodystrophy is a {{disorder}} {{in which the}} body is unable to produce fat.The medical condition is characterized by abnormal or degenerative conditions of the body's adipose tissue. ("Lipo" [...] is Greek for [...] "fat", and [...] "dystrophy" [...] is Greek for [...] "abnormal or degenerative condition".) A more specific term, lipoatrophy, is used when describing the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> from one area (usually the face).

50|$|High blood sugar, {{diabetes}} or worsening of diabetes, muscle pain, tenderness or weakness, and increased bleeding {{in people with}} hemophilia {{have been reported in}} patients taking protease inhibitor medicines like darunavir.

50|$|Medical {{diagnosis}} of CGL {{can be made}} after observing the physical symptoms of the disease: lipoatrophy (<b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> tissues) affecting the trunk, limbs, and face; hepatomegaly; acromegaly; insulin resistance; and high serum levels of triglycerides. Genetic testing can also confirm the disease, as mutations in the AGPAT2 gene is indicative of CGL1, a mutation in the BSCL2 gene is indicative of CGL2, and mutations in the CAV1 and PTRF genes are indicative of CGL3 and CGL4 respectively. Physical {{diagnosis of}} CGL is easier, as CGL patients are recognizable from birth, due to their extreme muscular appearance, which {{is caused by the}} absence of subcutaneous fat.|$|E

50|$|Ripping is {{considered}} a slow and sometimes painful process due to diet and exercise. A body builder will have to sacrifice many of their pleasures in life, in addition to increasing their workout intensity.

There are many types of performance enhancers that can help with the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> and the maintenance of muscle tissue. Of course, it is extremely unlikely that any performance enhancers or steroids will have an effect unless the person taking them is taking part in exercise or a specific diet plan.|$|E

40|$|In two studies, mice {{were fed}} diets {{containing}} either individual {{conjugated linoleic acid}} (CLA) isomers or a mixture of isomers in {{the presence or absence}} of dietary essential fatty acids. Mice fed the C 18 : 2 Δ 10, 12 CLA isomer lost as much body fat as mice fed a mixture of isomers. This effect was not observed when the mice were fed the C 18 : 2 Δ 9, 11 isomer or when feed intake was restricted. The <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> body <b>fat</b> was much greater in mice consuming an essential fatty acid deficient diet versus a control diet. This supports our hypothesis that for CLA to deplete body fat, it must first be metabolized in a manner similar to linoleic acid. Furthermore, we suggest that the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> body <b>fat</b> may be mediated by metabolism of CLA to an isomer of arachidonic acid. Understanding the mechanism by which CLA causes body fat loss, in pigs as well as mice, will allow for greater regulation <b>of</b> body <b>fat</b> content...|$|R
40|$|Defects in the DNA repair {{mechanism}} nucleotide excision repair (NER) {{may lead to}} tumors in xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) or to premature aging with <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> subcutaneous <b>fat</b> in Cockayne syndrome (CS). Mutations of mitochondrial (mt) DNA {{play a role in}} aging, but a link between the NER-associated CS proteins and base excision repair (BER) -associated proteins in mitochondrial aging remains enigmatic. We show functional increase of CSA and CSB inside mt and complex formation with mtDNA, mt human 8 -oxoguanine glycosylase (mtOGG) - 1, and mt single-stranded DNA binding protein (mtSSBP) - 1 upon oxidative stress. MtDNA mutations are highly increased in cells from CS patients and in subcutaneous <b>fat</b> <b>of</b> aged Csbm/m and Csa-/- mice. Thus, the NER-proteins CSA and CSB localize to mt and directly interact with BER-associated human mitochondrial 8 -oxoguanine glycosylase- 1 to protect from aging- and stress-induced mtDNA mutations and apoptosis-mediated <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> subcutaneous <b>fat,</b> a hallmark <b>of</b> aging found in animal models, human progeroid syndromes like CS and in normal human aging...|$|R
40|$|Seventy-eight healthy obese subjects, 40 premenopausal {{women and}} 38 men aged 27 - 51 yr {{received}} a 4. 2 MJ/day energy-deficit diet for 13 wk. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) and diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) were measured by indirect calorimetry. Abdominal subcutaneous and visceral fat areas were calculated from {{magnetic resonance imaging}} scans before and after weight loss. Before weight loss, visceral fat accumulation {{was positively correlated with}} higher levels of RMR (P < 0. 05) and DIT (P < 0. 01) in women but not in men. The mean weight reduction was 12. 2 +/- 3. 5 (SD) kg. In men but not in women, an initially large visceral fat depot was associated with a reduced <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> weight and total fat mass (P < 0. 05). Within each sex, an initial abundance <b>of</b> visceral <b>fat</b> was significantly related to a larger <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> visceral <b>fat</b> (P < 0. 001) and in men to a smaller <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> subcutaneous <b>fat</b> (P < 0. 05). These results suggest that there may be gender differences in the associations between visceral fat accumulation and components of energy expenditure (RMR and DIT) in obese subjects.
