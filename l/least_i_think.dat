500|$|Charlie McCollum for the Knight Ridder {{newspapers}} {{said that}} the first half fell flat on promises made to rejuvenate the series, adding that [...] "Storm Front" [...] represented [...] "a confusing premise, flat production and recycled stories." [...] Jamahl Epsicokhan, at his website Jammer's Reviews, gave both parts {{two and a half}} out of four stars. He wrote that the episode [...] "inherits so much nonsensical time-travel baggage from previous episodes (including last season's final 60 seconds) that the premise is all but indefensible" [...] and ultimately the episode [...] "breaks down the entire temporal war (at <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it does) to a single battle in Earth's past, that revolves around a single sci-fi MacGuffin: Vosk's conduit that the Nazis are constructing for him." ...|$|E
60|$|G. I suppose that's it. But it's not for myself. It's {{because of}} them. At <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it is.|$|E
6000|$|... "Philip, {{what are}} you doing? Those are my pet Australian carnations; at <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they are Australian. How can you destroy them like that?" ...|$|E
60|$|LORD GORING. He {{certainly}} has no secrets from me. At <b>least</b> <b>I</b> don’t <b>think</b> so.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear, {{how should}} I know? But at <b>least</b> <b>I</b> know--for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> {{can be sure}} of this--that he will not lack the will to help you; and to have the will, in a man like Captain Tremayne, is to find a way." ...|$|R
60|$|I was in {{the mood}} for being useful, or at <b>least</b> officious, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> for <b>I</b> now drew near him again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bella's a good sort," [...] {{returned}} Crestwick. [...] "She'll stop asking {{such questions}} by and by. At <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> she'll have some grounds for doing so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Why,’ replied Mr. Watkins Tottle evasively; for he trembled violently, {{and felt}} a sudden {{tingling}} throughout his whole frame; ‘why—I should certainly—at <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I should like—’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A man of {{the name}} of Simmons, I think, was the {{principal}} in the transaction. At <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that was the name on the bill of sale." ...|$|E
6000|$|Roberts: [...] "I--upon my word, <b>I</b> haven't the <b>least</b> idea. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> shall give {{up trying}} to {{identify}} the cook. Agnes must do it herself when she comes here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] he said, [...] "an American gentleman right enough. At <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> he {{was quite}} a gentleman, but a very civil person." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What I {{mean is that}} Mr. Greystock is,--at <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> so {{from what}} I hear,--the very last {{man in the world}} to marry for money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I expect I'll {{have to help}} on the farm--at <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I {{ought to}} help," [...] was the reply. [...] "You know this is the busy season." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{they just}} will fit in!" [...] cried Dave. [...] "At <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they will," [...] he added, more slowly. [...] "You say this mine {{is located in}} Montana?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh dear, oh dear!" [...] said she. [...] "No; I am not hurt; at <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> not--only just my arm a very little. Where is Emmeline? Is Emmeline hurt?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Passionately!" [...] exclaimed Charlotte; then, {{colouring}} to the eyes, she added, [...] "at <b>least</b> <b>I</b> sometimes <b>think</b> so, but <b>I</b> believe I am {{thought to}} be without taste." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now we {{are safe}} awhile," [...] {{she said with}} a sigh, [...] "or, at <b>least,</b> so <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> But <b>I</b> will lead you to where there is more light." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good. If {{you will}} make me say it, so do <b>I</b> also, at <b>least,</b> {{sometimes}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> so, {{when he is not}} dull," [...] and turning she fled from the room.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing {{to speak}} of, sir," [...] Reuben replied. [...] "At <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> not; but I feel rather queer from {{this loss of}} blood. I had better get myself bandaged up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was not a}} case of owing," [...] said Mr. Peacocke. [...] "At <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> not. I {{think she}} had learnt to love me as I had learnt to love her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "None! By Hathor, none--at <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> not. Yet I {{would have}} been free to search for such a one and take her when I found her, if she were but a fishergirl." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not very,' the Progenitor answered, in a {{somewhat}} embarrassed manner, surveying her curiously. 'At <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> not. He's gone to Holloway {{for an hour or}} two, but I fancy he'll be back for two o'clock luncheon, Miss----ur, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> caught your name, did I?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Too {{like the}} best electroplate! No; that is not fair, for it is not pretence, at <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> there was sound {{material}} below, and that never would brighten instead of dimming it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a very, {{very poor}} boy, father," [...] the girl replied. [...] "At <b>least</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> so; but <b>I</b> only {{looked at his}} face. He didn't speak like a poor boy at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] he replied; [...] "Mr. Pedgift {{informed}} me of all--at <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I may say so--of all the circumstances. I am to instruct, or perhaps, I {{ought to say}} to advise--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aaron's {{the man as}} bides in it," [...] Tommy {{continued}} hastily, [...] "at <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that's the name. Well, as you ken the house, you've maybe {{noticed a}} laddie that bides there too?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'O no,' said Somerset, {{shaking his}} head, and {{smiling at the}} minister's horror. 'She's not that; at <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> not.. [...] .. She's a woman; nothing more. Don't fear for her; all will be well.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know him--at <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> do. I've {{never seen}} him close enough to make sure. Maybe he's some fellow who belongs around here. I {{wanted to find out}} about him--just as {{everybody}} else wants to find out, that's all." ...|$|R
60|$|For I was {{so little}} {{inclined}} to sleep myself that night that I sat up working. It {{would not be}} worth mentioning for its own sake, but I was wakeful and rather low-spirited. I don't know why. At <b>least</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> know why. At <b>least,</b> perhaps <b>I</b> do, but <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> it matters.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{seems to}} go into it pretty deeply," [...] remarked Mr. Tolman, who had taken up the book. [...] "At <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> so, judging from all these calculations, and problems, and squares, and cubes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I detest him," [...] said Mrs. Carr to herself, [...] "at <b>least,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I do; but how neatly he put me down! There is {{no doubt}} about his being a gentleman, though insufferably conceited." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "’Prognotice,’ ses the skipper, at <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that’s {{the word}} he said. ’You keep {{perfectly}} still, an’ I’ll go an’ mix you up a draught, {{and tell the}} cook to get some strong beef-tea on.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's well," [...] {{continued}} Mrs. MacWhirr languidly. [...] "At <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> so. He never says." [...] She had {{a little}} laugh. The girl's face expressed a wandering indifference, and Mrs. MacWhirr surveyed her with fond pride.|$|E
5000|$|Roger Corman later {{claimed that}} [...] "all of the Poe films made money, but Tomb of Ligeia made the <b>least</b> amount. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{it was because}} the series was just running out of steam and also because it was overly complicated." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shan't {{give you}} away--at <b>least</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> so," [...] she promised cautiously. [...] "I shall see. Presently I will make terms, {{only this time}} I {{am not going to}} be left. I am going to have what I want." ...|$|R
60|$|These, if {{they are}} not all, are at <b>least</b> (as <b>I</b> <b>think)</b> the most {{considerable}} of those simple ideas which the mind has, out of which is made all its other knowledge; all which it receives only by the two forementioned ways of sensation and reflection.|$|R
