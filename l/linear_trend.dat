25|$|Starting with 15 {{men from}} eight nations at the inaugural 1896 Olympic 100m, {{participation}} in the event reached its peak at the 2000 Sydney Games, where 179 {{male and female athletes}} from 100 nations were present. The number of competitors and nations in the event has seen an increasing historical trend. This increase has been mostly linear, though participation dropped slightly in the 1904 and 1932 Olympics hosted in the United States (reflecting greater travel costs) and was also affected by the Olympic boycotts of 1976, 1980 and 1984.

40|$|The {{detrending}} {{moving average}} (DMA) algorithm {{is one of}} the best performing methods to quantify the long-term correlations in nonstationary time series. Many long-term correlated time series in real systems contain various trends. We investigate the effects of polynomial trends on the scaling behaviors and the performances of three widely used DMA methods including backward algorithm (BDMA), centered algorithm (CDMA) and forward algorithm (FDMA). We derive a general framework for polynomial trends and obtain analytical results for constant shifts and <b>linear</b> <b>trends.</b> We find that the behavior of the CDMA method is not influenced by constant shifts. In contrast, <b>linear</b> <b>trends</b> cause a crossover in the CDMA fluctuation functions. We also find that constant shifts and <b>linear</b> <b>trends</b> cause crossovers in the fluctuation functions obtained from the BDMA and FDMA methods. When a crossover exists, the scaling behavior at small scales comes from the intrinsic time series while that at large scales is dominated by the constant shifts or <b>linear</b> <b>trends.</b> We also derive analytically the expressions of crossover scales and show that the crossover scale depends on the strength of the polynomial trend, the Hurst index, and in some cases (<b>linear</b> <b>trends</b> for BDMA and FDMA) the length of the time series. In all cases, the BDMA and the FDMA behave almost the same under the influence of constant shifts or <b>linear</b> <b>trends.</b> Extensive numerical experiments confirm excellently the analytical derivations. We conclude that the CDMA method outperforms the BDMA and FDMA methods in the presence of polynomial trends. Comment: 13 Latex pages including 3 figure...|$|R

2500|$|Publicity has {{surrounded}} {{claims of}} a global warming hiatus during the period 1998–2013. [...] The exceptionally warm El Niño year of 1998 was an outlier from the continuing temperature trend, and so subsequent annual temperatures gave {{the appearance of a}} hiatus: by January 2006, it appeared to some that global warming had stopped or paused. A 2009 study showed that decades without warming were not exceptional, and in 2011 a study showed that if allowances were made for known variability, the rising temperature trend continued unabated. There was increased public interest in 2013 in the run-up to publication of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, and despite concerns that a 15-year period was too short to determine a meaningful trend, the IPCC included a section on a hiatus, which it defined as a much smaller increasing <b>linear</b> <b>trend</b> over the 15 years from 1998 to 2012, than over the 60 years from 1951 to 2012. Various studies examined possible causes of the short-term slowdown. Even though the overall climate system has continued to accumulate energy due to Earth's positive energy budget, the available temperature readings at the Earth's surface indicate slower rates of increase in surface warming than in the prior decade. [...] Since measurements {{at the top of the}} atmosphere show that Earth is receiving more energy than it is radiating back into space, the retained energy should be producing warming in the Earth's climate system.|$|E
2500|$|The {{author of}} an article, {{the history of}} {{education}} spending in Pakistan since 1972, argues that this policy target raises a fundamental question: What extraordinary {{things are going to}} happen that would enable Pakistan to achieve within six years what it has been unable to lay a hand on in the past six decades? The policy document is blank on this question and does not discuss the assumptions that form the basis of this target. Calculations of the author show that during the past 37 years, the highest public expenditure on education was 2.80 percent of GDP in 1987-88. Public expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP was actually reduced in 16 years and maintained in 5 years between 1972–73 and 2008-09. Thus, out of total 37 years since 1972, public expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP either decreased or remained stagnant for 21 years. The author argues if <b>linear</b> <b>trend</b> were maintained since 1972, Pakistan could have touched 4 percent of GDP well before 2015. However, it is unlikely to happen because the levels of spending have had remained significantly unpredictable and unsteady in the past. Given this disappointing trajectory, increasing public expenditure on education to 7 percent of GDP would be nothing less than a miracle but {{it is not going to}} be of godly nature. Instead, it is going to be the one of political nature because it has to be [...] "invented" [...] by those who are at the helm of affairs. The author suggests that little success can be made unless Pakistan adopts an [...] "unconventional" [...] approach to education. That is to say, education sector should be treated as a special sector by immunizing budgetary allocations for it from fiscal stresses and political and economic instabilities. Allocations for education should not be affected by squeezed fiscal space or surge in military expenditure or debts. At the same time, there is a need to debate others options about how Pakistan can [...] "invent" [...] the miracle of raising education expenditure to 7 percent of GDP by 2015.|$|E

The approach is described and its performance is compared with Cumulative Sum (CUSUM), Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), and Shewhart charts in detecting <b>linear</b> <b>trends</b> in the process mean. The results indicate that proposed approach is effective in detecting small to large trends. We also investigate the run length properties of the proposed approach under <b>linear</b> <b>trends</b> and compare its values with simulation results. Finally, we analyze the performance of the proposed approach in detecting the time when a drift occurs in the process and compare it with CUSUM and EWMA estimators. The results show that the proposed approach is more effective in detecting drift time for moderate and large trends...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} was to acquire information about consistency of ZTD (zenith total delay) <b>linear</b> <b>trends</b> and seasonal components between two consecutive GPS reprocessing campaigns. The analysis concerned two sets of the ZTD time series which were estimated during EUREF (Reference Frame Sub-Commission for Europe) EPN (Permanent Network) reprocessing campaigns according to 2008 and 2015 MUT AC (Military University of Technology Analysis Centre) scenarios. Firstly, Lomb–Scargle periodograms were generated for 57 EPN stations to obtain a characterisation of oscillations occurring in the ZTD time series. Then, the values of seasonal components and <b>linear</b> <b>trends</b> were estimated using the LSE (least squares estimation) approach. The Mann–Kendall trend test was also carried out to verify the presence of linear long-term ZTD changes. Finally, differences in seasonal signals and <b>linear</b> <b>trends</b> between these two data sets were investigated. All these analyses were conducted for the ZTD time series of two lengths: a shortened 16 -year series and a full 18 -year one. In the case of spectral analysis, amplitudes of the annual and semi-annual periods were almost exactly the same for both reprocessing campaigns. Exceptions were found for only a few stations and they did not exceed 1  mm. The estimated trends were also similar. However, for the reprocessing performed in 2008, the trends values were usually higher. In general, shortening of the analysed time period by 2 years resulted in a decrease of the <b>linear</b> <b>trends</b> values of about 0. 07  mm yr − 1. This was confirmed by analyses based on two data sets...|$|R

40|$|Around {{one million}} years ago the {{dominant}} frequency of glacial-interglacial cycles shifted from 41 to 100 kyr without apparent changes in insolation forcing. It has been demonstrated this shift, the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, can be simulated with a simple conceptual three-state climate model using only insolation as external forcing, remaining {{within the framework of}} classical astronomical theory. In order to produce the Mid-Pleistocene Transition the model uses two <b>linear</b> <b>trends</b> {{based on the assumption that}} atmospheric CO 2 decreased over time. In this research project we will reproduce this model and its results and we will improve the model by removing ad hoc assumptions and replacing the <b>linear</b> <b>trends</b> with continuous CO 2 forcing...|$|R
40|$|In {{his comment}} on Lindzen et al., Harrison {{found that the}} amount of {{high-level}} clouds, A, and the sea-surface temperature beneath clouds, T, averaged over a large oceanic domain in the western Pacific have secular <b>linear</b> <b>trends</b> of opposite signs over a period of 20 months. He found that when the <b>linear</b> <b>trends</b> are subtracted from the data, the correlation between the residual A and T is much reduced. His estimates of the confidence levels for the correlation indicate, moreover, that this correlation is not statistically significant. The domain-averaged A and, to a lesser degree, T, have distinct intra-seasonal and seasonal variations. These variations are influenced by the large-scale wind and temperature distributions and by the seasonal variation of insolation. To separate the local effect from the effect of slowly changing large-scale conditions, rather than subtracting 20 -month <b>linear</b> <b>trends</b> from the series, which has the potential to spuriously extrapolate intra-seasonal and seasonal variations to even longer time scales, we subtracted 30 -day running means of A and T from each time series; in effect, the data were high-pass filtered.
