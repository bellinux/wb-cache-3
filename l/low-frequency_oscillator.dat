25|$|A phaser is an {{electronic}} sound processor used to filter a signal {{by creating a}} series of peaks and troughs in the frequency spectrum. The position of the peaks and troughs of the waveform being affected is typically modulated so that they vary over time, creating a sweeping effect.

25|$|The {{limited edition}} package for Era Extraña {{came with the}} Pal198X, a mini analog {{synthesizer}} created by Palomo and the company Bleep Labs. With three oscillators, including two triangle waves and a square <b>low-frequency</b> <b>oscillator,</b> it is {{a modified version of}} the company's synth kit Pico Paso, with the addition of swappable controls. Some releases of the vinyl deluxe edition of Era Extraña also came with a 47-minute untitled mixtape, with only the text Neon Indian Mixtape labeled on the disc. The blog Disco Naïveté said that many of the mixtape tracks could have served as influences for Palomo in making Era Extraña. A 42-date North American tour for Era Extraña was announced on December 6, 2011. It premiered on December 31 at the Lights All Night festival in Dallas, Texas, and ended with a show at New York City's Terminal 5 on May 12, 2012.|$|E
500|$|One {{characteristic}} of certain strands of dubstep is the wobble bass, {{often referred to}} as the [...] "wub", where an extended bass note is manipulated rhythmically. This style of bass is typically produced by using a <b>low-frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> to manipulate certain parameters of a synthesiser such as volume, distortion or filter cutoff. [...] The resulting sound is a timbre that is punctuated by rhythmic variations in volume, filter cutoff, or distortion. This style of bass is a driving factor in some variations of dubstep, particularly at the more club-friendly end of the spectrum.|$|E
50|$|Two partials grouped {{together}} created a tone. Tones could be modified using {{up to three}} <b>low-frequency</b> <b>oscillators,</b> a pitch envelope, a programmable equalizer, and on-board effects such as reverberation and chorus. Two tones {{grouped together}} created a patch.|$|R
5000|$|In 2012, Teenage Engineering {{introduced}} several [...] "accessories" [...] for the OP-1. These {{can be used}} {{to manipulate}} the unit's macro effect knobs. One of the accessories makes the OP-1 compatible with Lego gears and motors, which {{can be used to}} mechanically modulate <b>low-frequency</b> <b>oscillators</b> and other effects.|$|R
5000|$|The {{former is}} termed the optical-spring effect and {{may lead to}} {{significant}} frequency shifts {{in the case of}} <b>low-frequency</b> <b>oscillators,</b> such as pendulum mirrors. In the case of higher resonance frequencies, [...] MHz, it does not significantly alter the frequency. For a harmonic oscillator, the relation between a frequency shift and a change in the spring constant originates from Hooke's law.|$|R
2500|$|A <b>low-frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> (LFO) is an {{electronic}} oscillator that generates a frequency below ≈20Hz. [...] This term is typically {{used in the}} field of audio synthesizers, to distinguish it from an audio frequency oscillator.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>low-frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> (LFO) generates an {{electronic}} signal, usually below 20Hz.

50|$|The {{modulation}} {{section of this}} synthesizer features four <b>low-frequency</b> <b>oscillators.</b> Three of these each have four available waveforms (sine, square, sawtooth and ramp), and these LFOs are dedicated to filter cutoff, and pitch {{of each of the}} two oscillators. These also have a programmable delay before their effect sets in. The fourth LFO is dedicated to pulse-width modulation of OSC1, and only its rate and depth are programmable.|$|R
50|$|Low-frequency {{oscillation}} (LFO) is {{an electronic}} signal {{which is usually}} below 20 Hz and creates a rhythmic pulse or sweep. This pulse or sweep {{is often used to}} modulate synthesizers, delay lines and other audio equipment in order to create effects used in the production of electronic music. Audio effects such as vibrato, tremolo and phasing are examples. The abbreviation LFO is also very often used to refer to <b>low-frequency</b> <b>oscillators</b> themselves.|$|R
50|$|The {{final output}} could be {{controlled}} by an organ-style keyboard as the primary user interface, but the notes—individual sounds—could also be triggered and/or modulated by a ribbon controller or by other modules such as white noise generators or <b>low-frequency</b> <b>oscillators.</b> The Moog modular systems were not designed as performance instruments, but were intended as sophisticated, studio-based professional audio systems {{that could be used}} as a musical instrument for creating and recording electronic music in the studio.|$|R

50|$|The chorus {{consists}} of two modules - a dual <b>low-frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> and the triple delay line oscillator. The <b>low-frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> puts out 0,6 Hz and 6 Hz mixed together as a tri-phase of the low-frequency oscillation to the delay line oscillator. The delay line oscillator {{consists of}} three TCA350 circuits - a chain of 185 MOS double transistor stages, which samples the audio signal, which is then modulated (FM) by the dual LFO so the output samples are shorter or longer.|$|E

The synthesizer was introduced at the 2012 NAMM Show. Despite pre-production uncertainty about sales, the MiniBrute sold well {{due to its}} low price point and expressive sound. In the following year, Arturia announced their next hardware synthesizer, the MicroBrute, a smaller and less expensive version of the MiniBrute with minikeys, a patch bank, and a sequencer. Both synthesizers received critical acclaim.|$|R

30|$|Furthermore, {{we present}} novel fast {{simulation}} models for a fading channel and diversity. It {{was reported in}} [16] that Jakes’ model [17] does not produce wide-sense stationary signals. The authors of [16] proposed to improve the model by randomizing the phase shifts of the <b>low-frequency</b> <b>oscillators.</b> We have modified Jakes’ model further by randomizing also the frequency shifts in the model. Several simulation studies are performed with the practical power control algorithms both in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and fading channels. The model is applicable to a multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) system with certain assumptions as discussed in Section  3. MIMO FxLMS algorithm has been recently studied for vibration control in [18].|$|R
40|$|Jakes' {{method is}} often used {{for the design of}} {{effective}} (Rayleigh) fading channel simulators, but only less is known about the achievable degree of accuracy. Our paper fills this gap by studying the statistical properties of Jakes' simulator. Therefore, analytical expressions are presented for the autocorrelation and cross-correlation function of inphase and quadrature components, {{as well as for the}} probability density function of envelope and phase. Moreover, an analytical investigation of the second order statistics (levelcrossing rate and average duration of fades) is also a topic of this paper. All these expressions are fundamental for the investigation of inevitable degradation effects due to a limited number of <b>low-frequency</b> <b>oscillators</b> or due to inherent insufficiencies of Jakes' method...|$|R

50|$|Each of the AX-60's 6 {{synthesizer}} voices {{consist of}} a single oscillator, which can output sawtooth, triangle, square, or sawtooth+triangle waveforms. Interestingly, pulse-width modulation is available for all four waveforms, with a dedicated <b>low-frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> (LFO) for this parameter. Pitch can be modulated by an LFO or the VCF cutoff frequency ADSR envelope generator, while the VCA volume has its own envelope generator.|$|E

5000|$|Early analog synthesizers used {{technology}} from electronic analog computers and laboratory test equipment. They were generally [...] "modular" [...] synthesizers, {{consisting of a}} number of independent electronic modules connected by patch cables into a patchbay that resembled the jackfields used by 1940s-era telephone operators. Synthesizer modules in early analog synthesizers included voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), voltage-controlled filters (VCFs), and voltage-controlled amplifiers (VCAs). The control voltage varied frequency in VCOs and VCFs, and attenuation (gain) in VCAs. Additionally, they used envelope generators, <b>low-frequency</b> <b>oscillators,</b> and ring modulators.Some synthesizers also had effects devices, such as reverb units, or tools such as sequencers or sound mixers. Because many of these modules took input sound signals and processed them, an analog synthesizer could be used both as a sound-generating and sound-processing system.|$|R

40|$|Integrated <b>low-frequency</b> <b>{{oscillators}}</b> {{can replace}} crystal oscillators as sleep-mode timers {{to reduce the}} size and cost of wireless sensors [1]. Since the timer {{is one of the few}} continuously functioning circuits, minimizing its power consumption can greatly reduce sleep-mode power of highly duty-cycled systems. Temperature stability of the oscillator is important in order to minimize timing uncertainly and guard time for the radios, and thus maximizing sleep time. The voltage-averaging feedback method described in [2] achieves high stability in the MHz frequencies, but when scaled to the kHz range, requires very large filters. On the other extreme, gate leakage-based timers have been designed for sub-nW power consumption, but operate in the sub-Hz frequencies [3]. In the past, high accuracy RC oscillators in the kHz range have been designed with feed-forward correction [1] and self-chopped operation [4]. In this work, an offset cancellation architecture achieves long-term frequency stability and temperature stability while operating at lower power...|$|R
