5000|$|In [...] "Melee", the {{objective}} is to earn as many slam points within a two-minute time period. For attack, a word bank that says [...] "Slam" [...] will fill up. Once the bank has filled up, the player can unleash a Slam Attack which can hit multiple opponents. For each opponent who's hit, the player will receive a Slam Point, but if a player get slammed, they'll lose one. The player with the most slam points after the time <b>limit</b> <b>stops</b> wins.|$|E

50|$|A {{student will}} begin the test after {{instruction}} from their proctors. The students will then have 4/5 hours {{to complete the}} test. For lunch, either a student is led to the appropriate place while the proctor locks up the tests in the test taking area, or their tests are confiscated for a 30-minute lunch period. The 4/5 hour time <b>limit</b> <b>stops</b> when the student is eating lunch and continues after lunch is over. However, if a student must get up to use the restroom, {{they will not be}} allowed extra time - they will lose time from their 4/5-hour time limit.|$|E
50|$|The parish {{is located}} in the western coast of the municipality, {{sandwiched}} between the parishes of Madalena and Candelária; a pie-shaped wedge that extends just to the base of Ponte do Pico to an area of about 2.75 kilometers at its maximum width. Unlike the other parishes with the municipality of Madalena, Criação Velha's borders does not extend to the top of Pico (its <b>limit</b> <b>stops</b> about 2 kilometers from the summit of the stratovolcano). The area is relatively hilly, sloping gradually from forested parcels into an area of semi-cultivatable land and then scrub pasture-lands. Most practical farming occurs around the central parish, since the forested lands are dense and impractical. The area is recognized for a series of grottos, with about 5 kilometers of extensions, carved from the dykes and subterranean lava fields along the island's history.|$|E
40|$|Instrument {{controls}} have haptic properties (force and compliance) {{to maximize}} the ease of use for vehicle occupants. A single force-feedback knob can emulate the feel of conventional control knobs (detents, <b>limit</b> <b>stops,</b> friction) and can produce new effects as well such as vibration, scrolling, and free-spin, all instantaneously reconfigurable under computer control. Such a haptic knob can simulate the functions of all instrument controls that it replaces and thus reduced to one device, {{the control of the}} dashboard provides the driver with instant access to all functions, quickly and ergonomically. The overall objective is to facilitate driver access to a growing array of electronic devices and vehicle functions for secondary control tasks, such as audio, climate, information and telematics without compromising the primary control task of driving. Several rotary force-feedback control knobs have been proposed for use in vehicular control that use a motor and a microprocessor controller to achieve the desired effect [1 - 4]. However, the magnitude of the torque available from these devices is limited {{by the size of the}} motor and its power consumption, both of which must be limited for practical use in a vehicle. This paper presents a novel haptic knob that additionally incorporates a brake to provide high torque capability in a small volume with low power consumption...|$|E

30|$|During {{the meeting}} several {{concerns}} arose, e.g., scope of issues is too extensive, {{the most important}} ones which were selected {{to be worked on}} will be discussed here. A major issue was that team members wanted to be more proactive when dealing with problems and bottlenecks. Although they identified a major bottleneck in their workflow, they ignored it for a while and waited for someone else to resolve it for them. This was mentioned by team members as both an advantage and disadvantage of Kanban. On the pro side problems and bottlenecks become visible quite early, but on the con side, if nobody feels responsible and the bottleneck is not resolved, the WIP <b>limit</b> <b>stops</b> the whole development process. We talked about this and it was explained to them, that this is one purpose of WIP limits, to make it impossible to ignore problems and bottlenecks so they have to be resolved and not linger on for all eternity. If they still choose to ignore it, they will soon see the consequences. They understood this explanation and consequently they made a time-phased plan how to resolve this bottleneck and immediately took the first steps. Another effect of this situation was, that they want to give the work on the project more priority, so this “Waiting for Godot” will not happen again. As this is a more vague resolution we plan on examining this strategy in the future.|$|E
40|$|Floating Production, Storage, and Offloading (FPSO) Systems {{are quite}} often {{subjected}} to stochastic sea wave loadings. In this thesis, a methodology is developed for estimating the fatigue life of topside structures. Proper Response Amplitude Operator (RAO) of the FPSO system, and the well-known Ochi-Hubble sea wave elevation spectrum are combined {{to provide the}} design spectrum at the deck level on topside FPSO. For ordinary Single-Degree-of-System (S-D-O-F) piece of equipment, the dynamic response is simulated by a time series model. A non-recursive Rainflow cycle counting method {{is applied to the}} equipment stress time history to identify significant cycles that produce fatigue damage in the time domain. The results of the Rainflow cycle counting method are supplemented by results from a power spectrum based, exclusively, approach. Further, pipe systems with/without <b>limit</b> <b>stops</b> on topside FPSO are modeled as Bernoulli-Euler beam. A Galerkin method is therefore employed in conjunction with the beam random vibration theory. Specifically, the statistical linearization technique is adopted to derive the equivalent linear system for the pipe example with nonlinear constraints. The applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated by the analysis of both a simple S-D-O-F piece of equipment and by an illustrative example of pipeline conveying fluid with/without nonlinear constraints subject to sea wave loading. The proposed in this thesis integrated approach can be used for the stochastic fatigue analysis of structures on topsides FPSO during preliminary design when piping system responses must be estimated analytically. Further work can consider the coupling between the transverse and the longitudinal response of the pipelines on topside of FPSO and related issues...|$|E

25|$|Local and limited-stop buses provide service {{within a}} single borough, {{or in some cases}} across two. While local buses make all stops along a route, limited-stop buses only make stops at busy {{transfer}} points, points of interest, and heavily used roadways. <b>Limited</b> <b>stop</b> service was first attempted with the M4 bus during rush hours in 1973, then expanded to other routes from there. The usual setup is that <b>limited</b> <b>stop</b> service runs the full route, while local services run only in the <b>limited</b> <b>stop</b> area, and the <b>limited</b> <b>stop</b> buses run local at the tail ends of the route not served by locals (similar to the operation of some subway services and the Staten Island Railway). There are also full-route limited-stop buses, with local variants that make <b>limited</b> <b>stops</b> along the entire route; limited-only buses with no local variants under the same route number; and limited-zone buses, with a semi-limited section (with smaller distances between stops than on regular limited routes) near the route's tail ends, and a non-stop section in the middle.|$|R
