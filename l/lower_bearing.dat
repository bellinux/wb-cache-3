40|$|Many {{cases of}} high {{vibration}} and changing vibration in reactor coolant pumps (RCPs) {{can be traced}} to one of several types of degradation in the <b>lower</b> motor guide <b>bearing.</b> This paper presents a comparison of the vibrational characteristics for several failure modes. Included in this list are loss of lubricant, bearing overloading, and time-varying shoe clearance. Each of the examples studied is from an actual pump which underwent a <b>lower</b> guide <b>bearing</b> failure. In each case the pump was operated for an extended period following the onset of the failure mechanism. This type of operation raises the question of its effect on the fatigue life of the pump shaft and other components. This paper provides a simple assessment {{of the extent to which}} fatigue life is impacted. I. Background I. 1 Design Considerations Experience has shown that one of the most common failures in nuclear main coolant pumps involves the <b>lower</b> motor <b>bearing.</b> Typically, the <b>lower</b> guide <b>bearing</b> is an oil-immersed, segmented shoe bearing. Figure 1 shows the arrangement for a typical Westinghouse, or similarly designed, reactor coolant pump. There are several reasons for the frequency of these failures compared to failures in the other bearings. Collectively, the reasons may be summarized in that main coolant pumps are three-bearing machines, wherein the <b>lower</b> guide <b>bearing</b> has the weakest design of the three. Therefore, under conditions such as misalignment where all the bearings have higherthan-normal loads, it is the <b>lower</b> motor <b>bearing</b> that is most likely to fail...|$|R

50|$|If left in {{standing}} water, pedestal pumps {{should be}} manually run {{from time to}} time, even if {{the water in the}} sump isn't high enough to trip the float switch. This is because these pumps are incapable of removing all the water in a sump and the <b>lower</b> <b>bearing</b> or bushing for the pump impeller shaft tends to remain submerged, making it prone to corrosion and eventually freezing the drive shaft in the bearing. In the alternative, a pedestal pump that is expected to remain idle for an extended time should be removed from the sump and stored out of water, or the sump should be mopped out to bring the level of the remaining water well below the lower shaft bearing.|$|E
50|$|The Willans {{engine was}} single-acting; steam {{pressure}} was only {{applied to the}} upper surface of the pistons. This was a common feature of high-speed engines at this time, in a measure to reduce knocking and increased wear, thus permitting higher operating speeds. The principle was that in a single-acting engine the forces on the connecting rod and its bearings always act to compress the rod, rather than reversing direction twice in every revolution, as for the double-acting engine. The <b>lower</b> <b>bearing</b> brasses, which carried a load only during starting, were smaller than the crankpin and the main working brasses above. Although single-acting engines produce only half the power of an equivalent double-acting engine, or else must run at twice their speed, this reduced knocking could allow them to run {{more than twice as}} fast.|$|E
50|$|The bimetal bushing, {{which is}} locked into the bore of the chock, {{has a high}} tin Babbitt lining in a steel shell. Loading of the bearing is always vertical, with the load bearing section {{at the top of}} the upper bearing and at the bottom of the <b>lower</b> <b>bearing.</b> The bearing lining is {{undercut}} on the horizontal centerline (the rebore) so that oil entering the bearing is drawn in by the rotation and eccentricity of the journal. Oil is generally supplied to the rebore following the minimum film thickness, then drawn through the unloaded half of the bushing before entering the load zone, where the hydrodynamic oil film and pressure field are formed. The total oil flow is specified to optimize the cooling of the bearing. Oil flow and feed pressure are specified for each individual mill during the design phase and each mill has specific documentation defining these parameters.|$|E

5000|$|Brazil officially {{opened the}} Resende {{enrichment}} plant in May 2006. Brazil's enrichment technology development, {{and the plant}} itself, involved substantial discussions with the IAEA and its constituent nations. The dispute came down to whether IAEA inspectors {{would be allowed to}} inspect the machines themselves. The Brazilian government did not allow the inspection of the centrifugal cascade halls, arguing that this would reveal technological secrets (probably relating to the use of a magnetic <b>lower</b> <b>bearing</b> in place of the more common mechanical bearing). The Brazilian authorities stated that, as Brazil is not part of any [...] "axis of evil", the pressure for full access to inspection - even in universities - could be construed as an attempt to pirate industrial secrets. They also claimed that their technology is better than that of the United States and France, mainly because the centrifugal axis is not mechanical, but electromagnetic. Eventually, after extensive negotiations, agreement was reached that while not directly inspecting the centrifuges, the IAEA would inspect the composition of the gas entering and leaving the centrifuge. Then-U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell stated in 2004 that he was sure that Brazil had no plans to develop nuclear weapons.|$|E
5000|$|A {{relatively}} recent development, integrated headsets {{do away with}} the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>bearing</b> cups on threadless headsets and instead seat the bearings directly against the head tube of the frame. Favored sometimes for their aesthetic appeal, integrated headsets reduce the number of parts involved in the headset assembly. Prominent standards for integrated headsets include Cane Creek's [...] "IS" [...] and Campagnolo's standard, which is nameless apart from the manufacturer name. Chris King, a leading headset manufacturer, offers a vehement argument against the implementation of integrated headsets. The basis of King's argument is that headtubes with bearing [...] "seats" [...] are far from being machined with reasonable precision. The headset cartridge bearings therefore sit somewhat loosely in the headtube of the bicycle (as opposed to being press fit). During use, the bearings, under thrust loads, will rock in their seats and will easily damage the softer frame material (often aluminum, although some titanium frames are manufactured for integrated headsets). Given enough damage to the frame, there would be no choice but to replace the frame, especially if the frame is made of an aluminum alloy (titanium and steel can potentially be repaired, but usually at great cost to the consumer).King also argues that the integrated headset is largely a cost-cutting measure for many of the larger bicycle manufacturers, since integrated headsets are somewhat cheaper and take less time to install.|$|E

40|$|For cast-in-place piling for railway structures, {{usually the}} Boring Hole (BH) method with normal {{circulation}} boring or TBH method with reverse circulation boring is applied. Small-sized machines {{can be used}} in piling with normal circulation boring; thus, the piling has high workability in narrow spaces with low overhead clearance. On the other hand, slurry generally cannot be managed in that method. Furthermore, due to the drilling mechanism of that method, slime easily accumulates at the pile head and mud cake often adheres to bore walls, <b>lowering</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity of piles and reliability of pile body quality. For that reason, the reverse circulation boring method where pile reliability is greater is applied to piles of main structure in railway civil engineering, although larger machines than for normal circulation boring are used.

30|$|Similarly, it {{is worth}} {{explaining}} why the gravity-based recentering mechanism of the RNC isolator is unique {{and it is not}} traditional. The integrated passive recentering mechanism of the RNC isolator can provide gravity-based recentering force without generating any undesired side effects. Several available traditional isolation devices [such as springs, elliptical and friction pendulum systems (FPS)] can provide some recentering forces but they are always accompanied by the generation of vertical accelerations out from the horizontal acceleration components, which leads to additional vertical vibration of structural elements, housed inner equipment and occupants discomfort. Moreover, the configurations that provide such recentering forces in elliptical and FPS isolation systems force the isolated structure to oscillate as a simple pendulum with a single vibration period, which may be close to the dominant period of the exciting earthquake causing resonance unlike the RNC isolator. In the RNC isolator, although the rolling core is ellipsoidal to provide adequate eccentricity for gravity-based recentering, the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>bearing</b> plates are provided with carefully designed inner curvatures (facing the rolling core) to exactly absorb any generated vertical displacement that arises from rolling of the elliptical core. This always keeps the vertical offset between the upper and the <b>lower</b> <b>bearing</b> plates unchanged during the RNC isolator motion, which theoretically prevents the generation of vertical motion component out from the horizontal one, leading to a unique recentering behavior of the RNC isolator.|$|E

Reasonable agreement was noted for theoretical values of damping for these same assemblies. Values of damping coefficients varied from 150 to 780 N sec/m.
