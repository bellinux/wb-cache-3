40|$|The {{atmospheric}} corrosion of lead is investigated, {{with the aim}} to improve {{the understanding of the}} environmental degradation of historical organ pipes. Fieldwork is combined with laboratory investigations. The field studies included characterization of the organ environment and exposures of lead coupons. The environment inside the organ wind system of instruments suffering corrosion was mapped and compared with instruments unaffected by corrosion, in five countries in Europe. In the heavily corroded organs, relatively high concentrations of acetic and formic acid vapours were present, and large amounts of carboxylates accumulated on the lead coupons. The organic acids are emitted from woodwork in the organs. The effect of acetic and formic acid vapours in the ppb range of the {{atmospheric corrosion}} of pure lead was investigated under well controlled conditions in the laboratory. The combined effect of acetic and formic acid vapours was also examined. The influences of temperature, relative humidity, inorganic air pollutants (NO 2 and SO 2) and particulates (NaCl) were studied as well. Corrosion rate was measured gravimetrically and the corrosion products were analysed by XRD, ESEM, FIB, ion chromatography and quantitative carbonate analysis. The mechanism of corrosion attack is addressed. Traces of acetic acid vapour strongly accelerate <b>lead</b> <b>corrosion.</b> Mass gain is linear with time and depends linearly on the acetic acid concentration. Corrosion showed a relatively weak dependence on relative humidity in the range 50 - 95 %. <b>Lead</b> <b>corrosion</b> was inversely related to temperature; mass gain was 50 % higher at 4. 0 ºC than at 22. 0 ºC. The corrosion rate increased with decreasing temperature in the range 22. 0 - 4. 0 ºC. It is proposed that lead suffers electrochemical corrosion in the presence of traces of acetic acid vapour. The corrosion products were unevenly distributed. Lead acetate oxide hydrate (Pb(CH 3 COO) 2 ∙ 2 PbO∙H 2 O), plumbonacrite (Pb 10 O(OH) 6 (CO 3) 6), litharge (a-PbO) and massicot (b-PbO) were identified by X-ray diffraction. Formic acid vapour is also corrosive towards lead, although somewhat less so than acetic acid. In this instance the corrosion products, consisting of plumbonacrite and lead formate hydroxide (Pb(HCOO) (OH)), are evenly distributed. The combination of acetic and formic acid has a slightly synergistic effect on <b>lead</b> <b>corrosion,</b> which resulted in a more localized attack than for the acetic and formic acid exposures. The results show that acetic and formic acid vapours emitted from woodwork in the organs are decisive in the corrosion of historical organs. Methods for mitigating organ corrosion are discussed.

40|$|Lead is a known toxin, {{with the}} ability to {{accumulate}} in the human body from as early as fetal development. Lead exposure is known to cause a myriad of health effects which are more prominent among children. Health effects upon exposure can range from renal and heart disease or potentially cancer in adults to neurotoxicity in children. The continued presence of old lead service lines and plumbing in distribution systems as well as lead-containing solders and brass fixtures in homes may contribute lead to drinking water. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of a predictor known as the chloride-to-sulfate mass ratio (CSMR) in controlling lead release. A ratio above 0. 5 – 0. 6 theoretically increases the aggressiveness of lead leaching in galvanic settings, while a lower ratio controls <b>lead</b> <b>corrosion.</b> A switch in coagulant type could significantly alter the ratio. However, a coagulant switch could also trigger changes in finished water turbidity and organics, including disinfection by-product (DBP) precursors, as well as impact sludge production. Anecdotal evidence from an Ontario water treatment utility suggested the potential applicability of a newly formulated polymer, cationic activated silica (CAS), in improving DBP precursor removal when used in concurrence with a primary coagulant. No previous scientific research had been dedicated to testing of the polymer. The present research had three primary objectives: The first was to investigate the effect of conventional coagulation with six different coagulants on the chloride-to-sulfate mass ratio as it pertains to <b>lead</b> <b>corrosion</b> in two Ontario source waters of differing quality. Additionally, the effect of coagulant choice on pH, turbidity, and organics removal was investigated. The second objective was aimed at testing potential reductions in CSMR and organics that could be brought about by the use of two polymers, cationic and anionic activated silica (CAS and AAS, respectively), as flocculant aids. Finally, the performance of a high-rate sand-ballasted clarification process was simulated at bench-scale to gauge its performance in comparison with conventional coagulation simulation techniques. The first series of jar-tests investigated the effectiveness of CAS as a primary coagulant on Lake Ontario water. In comparison with the conventional coagulants aluminum sulfate and polyaluminum chloride, CAS did not offer any apparent advantage with respect to turbidity and organics removal. Testing of CAS and AAS as flocculant aids was also conducted. Results from a full factorial experiment focused on CAS testing on Lake Ontario water showed that coagulant dose is the most significant contributor to CSMR, turbidity, DOC removal, and THM control. Generally, improvements resulting from CAS addition were of small magnitude (90 %) with both coagulants were achieved at the tested coagulant and AAS doses of 10 mg/L and 4 mg/L respectively. CSMR reductions in the presence of AAS were also attributable to sulfate contribution from sulfuric acid. Bench-scale simulation of a high-rate sand-ballasted clarification process on Grand River water showed comparable removal efficiencies for turbidity (80 – 90 % at 10 mg/L), and DOC (30 – 40 % at 50 mg/L). Finally, six different coagulants were tested on the two source waters for potential applicability in CSMR adjustment in the context of <b>lead</b> <b>corrosion.</b> The two chloride-containing coagulants polyaluminum chloride and aluminum chlorohydrate increased CSMR in proportion to the coagulant dose added, as would be expected. Average chloride contribution per 10 mg/L coagulant dose was 2. 7 mg/L and 2. 0 mg/L for polyaluminum chloride and aluminum chlorohydrate, respectively. Sulfate-contributing coagulants aluminum sulfate, ferric sulfate, pre-hydroxylated aluminum sulfate, and polyaluminum silicate sulfate reduced CSMR as coagulant dose increased, also as would be expected. The highest sulfate contributors per 10 mg/L dose were pre-hydroxylated aluminum sulfate (6. 2 mg/L) and ferric sulfate (6. 0 mg/L). The lowest CSMR achieved was 0. 6 in Lake Ontario water at a 30 mg/L dose and 0. 8 in Grand River water at a 60 mg/L dose. Highest DOC removals were achieved with the chloride-containing coagulants in both waters (35 – 50 %) with aluminum chlorohydrate showing superiority in that respect. DOC removals with sulfate-containing coagulants were less, generally in the range of 22 – 41 %. Specificity of critical CSMR values to source water needs to be investigated. Additionally, long term effects of sustained high or low CSMR values in distribution systems need to be further looked into. Finally, the effect of interventions to alter CSMR on other water quality parameters influencing <b>lead</b> <b>corrosion</b> such as pH and alkalinity still represent a research deficit...|$|E

40|$|Generation IV {{nuclear power}} {{technologies}} provide attractive {{solutions to the}} common issues related to conventional nuclear power plants currently in operation worldwide. Through a significant reduction of the long-term radiotoxicity of nuclear waste, a more efficient use of nuclear fuel resources, and implementation of inherent safety features, Generation IV will make nuclear power sustainable and thus increase the public acceptance of nuclear power. Due to its attractive safety features, the lead-cooled fast reactor (LFR) {{is one of the}} most studied Generation IV reactor concepts currently. It is well known that liquid lead is corrosive to steels at elevated temperatures, thus limiting the operation temperature of the LFR. The use of alumina-forming FeCrAl alloys has been proposed to mitigate oxidation and corrosion issues. Commercial FeCrAl alloys have Cr-concentrations typically about 20 wt. % and are thus prone to α-α’ phase separation and embrittlement at temperatures up to about 500 °C. Reducing the Cr-concentration to levels around 10 wt. % would theoretically resolve the said issue. However, the oxidation and corrosion resistance may be impaired. In the scientific literature, compositional limits indicating the formation of protective alumina layers at various temperatures have been presented. Long-term corrosion studies are however scarce. Moreover, in-depth studies on the compositional limits regarding α-α’ phase separation are lacking. In this thesis, the long-term (up to 10, 000 h) corrosion resistance and phase stability of alumina-forming alloys are studied at temperatures up to 550 °C. In addition, the influence of reactive elements (RE), e. g. Ti, Zr, and Y, on the liquid <b>lead</b> <b>corrosion</b> resistance of Fe 10 CrAl alloys is evaluated. By balancing the reactive element and the carbon content, with respect to carbide formation, it is demonstrated in this thesis that it is possible to form protective alumina layers on Fe 10 Cr 4 Al alloys from 450 °C, despite the low Al and Cr concentrations. It was found that the RE/carbon ratio needed to form protective alumina layers on Fe 10 Cr 4 Al alloys must be larger than unity to mitigate the detrimental effect of Cr-carbide formation.   The underlying phenomena are discussed, and a mechanism is suggested based on the outcome of the long-term oxidation studies. The phase stability of Fe 10 CrAl alloys was studied through thermal aging experiments in the temperature interval of 450 to 550 °C. In addition, the results were well reproducible using a developed Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) model of the FeCrAl system. Furthermore, the model indicated that the Cr-concentration should be limited to about 11 wt. % in a FeCr 4 Al alloy to mitigate α-α’ phase separation at all temperatures of interest for an LFR. The liquid <b>lead</b> <b>corrosion</b> resistance of alumina-forming austenitic stainless steels was shown to be superior compared to regular stainless steels, albeit the effect of ferrite stabilizing elements needs to be further addressed. The results included in this thesis provide a valuable input on the key issues related to the development of corrosion resistant alumina-forming alloys of interest for liquid lead applications. Moreover, the superior oxidation properties of the studied alumina-forming alloys make them of interest for use in other energy applications, where corrosion issues limits the operation temperature and thus the efficiency.   QC 20141217 </p...|$|E

Lead release caused by changes in water chemistry (e. g., redox conditions) is often due to the destabilization of lead carbonate and oxide solid phases. Although prior {{studies have examined the}} effects of varying water chemistry on the stability of β-PbO 2 (plattnerite), β-PbO 2 stability under depleting chlorine conditions is poorly understood. In addition little is known regarding the mechanisms by which Pb 3 O 4 (minium) dissolves under drinking water conditions. In this thesis, long-term batch dissolution experiments were performed for pure phase β-PbO 2 and Pb 3 O 4 under depleting chlorine conditions. Results indicate that the initial availability of free chlorine effectively depresses dissolved lead concentrations released from both solid phases. From the Pb 3 O 4 dissolution experiments, it was found that Pb 3 O 4 was first oxidized by free chlorine to form β-PbO 2. After chlorine was depleted, Pb 3 O 4 solvolytic disproportionation resulted in growth of β-PbO 2 and an increase in dissolved lead concentrations. The formation of lead carbonates controlled the final lead concentrations (~ 0. 1 mg/L) for Pb 3 O 4 dissolution. In contrast, for the β-PbO 2 dissolution experiments, the dissolved lead levels remained low (~ 0. 004 mg/L) even after free chlorine was depleted. Detailed characterization of solid samples collected during the β-PbO 2 experiments indicate that Pb 2 + impurities present in crystalline β-PbO 2 play a dominant role in the stability of this solid phase...|$|E

40|$|The study {{investigated}} the basic geomechanical and mineralogical evolution of the bentonite barrier under various experimental boundary conditions which replicated the near-field Thermo-Hydro-Chemico (THC) conditions in a repository. The relationships between the physicochemical alterations {{and changes in the}} geotechnical properties have seldom been studied, especially on a consistent dataset. This paper attempts to link the physicochemical properties of Na-bentonite (MX- 80) to the macro-scale engineering functionality of the bentonite post THC exposure. Experiments investigated the impact of THC variables on the engineering and physicochemical functionality of the bentonite with respect to its application within a High-Level Waste (HLW) engineered barrier system. Intrinsic alterations to the MX- 80 bentonite under relatively short-term exposure to hydrothermal and chemical conditions were measured. Additionally, two long-term tests were conducted under ambient conditions to consider the impact of exposure duration. The intrinsic measurements were then related to the overall performance of the bentonite as a candidate barrier material for application in a UK geological disposal facility. Findings indicate that exposure to thermo-saline-corrosion conditions (i. e., corrosion products derived from structural grade 275 carbon steel) inhibits the free swell capacity and plasticity of the bentonite. However, the measured values remained above the design limits set out for the Swedish multi-barrier concept, from which the UK concept may take a <b>lead.</b> <b>Corrosion</b> alone does not appear to significantly affect the geotechnical measurements compared with the influence of thermal loading and high saline pore water after relatively short-term exposure.

Corroded organ pipes from the field have been analyzed and the environment inside the organ wind system has been mapped. Comparably high concentrations of organic acid vapours are present in heavily corroded organs. In addition, acetaldehyde and formaldehyde are present in smaller amounts. To verify the connection between environmental parameters and corrosion effects, the field work is combined with laboratory investigations. The effect of sub-ppm concentrations of acetic and formic acid vapours on <b>lead</b> <b>corrosion</b> was investigated. The effect of NO 2 and SO 2 was also studied. The samples were exposed to synthetic air with careful control of relative humidity, temperature, concentration of air pollutants and flow conditions. Exposure times were between one and four weeks. Corrosion rate was measured gravimetrically and the corrosion products were analysed by X-ray diffraction, environmental scanning electron microscopy, ion chromatography and quantitative carbonate analysis. The atmospheric corrosion of lead is strongly accelerated by traces of acetic acid vapour. Mass gain is linear with time and depends linearly on the acetic acid concentration. It is suggested that the corrosion of lead in the presence of traces of acetic acid vapour is electrochemical in nature. The corrosion products detected by X-ray diffraction were plumbonacrite, Pb 10 O(OH) 6 (CO 3) 6, lead acetate oxide hydrate, Pb(CH 3 COO) 2 &# 8729; 2 PbO&# 8729;H 2 O, and lead oxide, PbO. Formic acid is slightly less corrosive than acetic acid. In this case, the main corrosion product were lead formate hydroxide, Pb(HCOO) (OH) and plumbonacrite. In comparison to the organic acids, NO 2 and SO 2 are far less corrosive towards lead. This implies that emissions of NO 2 and SO 2 from traffic and combustion of fossil fuels are of minor importance for the atmospheric corrosion of lead. The results imply that acetic and formic acid vapours emitted from woodwork in the organs are very important corrosive agents for lead pipes in historical organs.
