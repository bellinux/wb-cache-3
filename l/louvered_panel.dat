The gun fairing partially covered the gun and extended rearwards, replacing the windshield. This, however, seriously limited pilot vision to the front and, although retained on training aircraft, it was ordered removed on aircraft destined for front line units in France. The bulged engine access panel located under the exhaust pipe on British models was made of a solid sheet of metal, {{in place of the}} <b>louvered</b> <b>panel</b> fitted on French production models. Some British SPADs were also fitted with small spinners on the prop hub.|$|E

50|$|Uncertainty {{about the}} ability of a city the modest size of Spokane to create a {{successful}} event caused many nations and corporations to hesitate about making major investments in the fair. Kodak, General Motors, and Ford hosted pavilions at this fair but they were scaled down in size and presence compared to the exhibits constructed for the New York Worlds Fair ten years earlier. For {{the first time since the}} company's beginning, General Electric did not have a fair pavilion but it sponsored the musical group Up with People that performed during the summer at the fair. Pacific Northwest Bell had a pavilion that eliminated the use of air conditioning by using <b>louvered</b> <b>panels</b> on the roof. They demonstrated the use of TTY equipment and discussed the use of 911 for emergency telephone services.

50|$|Sited 20 {{feet above}} {{the banks of the}} Bayou Teche, the {{construction}} of Shadows-on-the-Teche, a two-and-a-half-story, sixteen room house, coincided with the apogee of the Greek Revival style in United States architecture. When following this style, builders minimized the installation of superfluous decorative elements such as cornices, moldings, and trim. Decorations were severely limited and were designed to blend into and set off the building's handmade red brick construction. The seven bay entrance facade is located on the south front and is made up of eight full-height Tuscan columns of white-plastered brick standing on high square bases, that support a second-floor gallery or veranda, and topped by a Doric frieze.

2500|$|The facades {{are similar}} with regular door and window {{openings}} and with small balconies to the second-floor openings. There {{is a small}} partial false gable roof of Spanish barrel red-clay tiles around the four sides and around the courtyard. On the front (south) facade, facing the ocean, there are five bays with a large elliptical arch-headed passageway large enough for vehicular traffic.

In the elliptical arch there is a simple fanlight window. Flanking the arched entrance are two large high windows on each side.
