25|$|The {{books of}} those that wrote before us survive, and {{therefore}} we are taught about what was written then. For this reason it is good that we also in our time, here among us, write some material from scratch, inspired by the example of these old customs; so that it might, when we are dead and elsewhere, {{be left to the}} world's ear in the time coming after this. But because men say, and it's true, that when someone writes entirely about wisdom, it often dulls a man's wit who reads it every day. For that reason, if you permit it, I would like to take the middle way, and write a book between the two, somewhat of passion, somewhat of instruction, that whether of high or low status, people may <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> write about.|$|E
500|$|Beltran {{said that}} he was not aware {{of the effects of the}} {{interactions}} this was having with the crew, and described the situation, saying, [...] "for me it was like, 'OK, you can fire me if you want to. Go ahead, and I'll leave.'" [...] He compared his experience on Voyager to working in a car factory, and said that the repetitive scenes meant that it limited his creativity. Beltran explained that it did not affect his relationship with the other actors, and in the end, he felt the producers decided to keep him on the cast as it did not make [...] "very much difference, except to a very, very small percentage of fans who maybe didn't <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> said." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone magazine, Franklin {{said she wanted to}} do [...] "a record with a younger sound to it.

500|$|Smith {{graduated}} from Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts in 1991 {{with a degree}} in philosophy and political science. [...] "Went straight through in four years", he explained to Under the Radar in 2003. [...] "I guess it proved to myself that I could do something I really didn't want to for four years. Except I did <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was studying. At the time it seemed like, 'This is your one and only chance {{to go to college and}} you had just better do it because some day you might wish that you did.' Plus, the whole reason I applied in the first place was because of my girlfriend, and I had gotten accepted already even though we had broken up before the first day." [...] After he graduated, he [...] "worked in a bakery back in Portland with a bachelor's degree in philosophy and legal theory".|$|E
500|$|In May 2010, Cooper {{felt that}} she had been sidelined by former {{producer}} Lucy Allan and that Jacqui had lost her identity. New executive producer Paul Marquess also felt that Cooper had been under used. He decided to split Jacqui away {{from the rest of the}} McQueens, his reason for which being that there was so much [...] "talent" [...] in terms of acting within the family, he felt Cooper or Jacqui didn't need that [...] "support system". He increased her role in storylines. This made Cooper delighted, of the changes she stated: [...] "he seemed to <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> did and he's worked on it and developed it. Paul has really taken me under his wing, he's worked me so hard and he's given me opportunities that I could only have dreamt of." [...] Speaking of her approach to playing Jacqui, Cooper has said: [...] "I try to tame Claire back because I'm a really emotional, sensitive person and very different from Jacqui, so I do work hard and I feel very privileged." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Townsend {{announced}} that he was using other guitars besides his Peavey models, including two Sadowsky Telecaster models and a number of Framus semi-hollow body guitars. In regard to this, Townsend stated on HeavyBlogIsHeavy.com: [...] "The Peavey situation was intense and a real eye opener in terms of how things REALLY work in the business side of endorsements, and I can’t say I really enjoyed it, but we got the guitar out and everyone is nice to each other so all good... I really like that V. However, I decided to use other guitars for other stuff as well, a Sadowsky Tele set, a Framus hollowbody group of guitars, and the V’s. No one is entirely happy with that decision, but I find it difficult to not be straight up with folks about what I want to play and do and have typically pissed people off as a result... The bottom line though is I <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> like and it is important to the music to be accurate with tones and vibe. The guitars I actually play, I really like, regardless of brand." ...|$|E
60|$|Your {{remarks on}} Chaucer pleased me very much. I am glad you <b>liked</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> did--or tried to do--and {{as to the}} criticisms, you were right--and they sha'n't be {{unattended}} to if the opportunity of correction be given to me.|$|R

500|$|In {{response}} to the news confirming the development of HeartGold and SoulSilver, fans posted their reactions and commentary on the Internet. In particular, IGN editor Jack DeVries reasoned that {{the primary reason for}} the updated games was to be compatible with Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, allowing players to collect old Pokémon species that were previously unobtainable in the new games. He also expressed skepticism that the new titles could match the quality of the originals; stating, [...] "For me, Gold/Silver were amazing because they introduced so many new features that have since become standards for the series. It was the first, and only, time the Pokémon games have made such a significant expansion. These days we're lucky if we get a new feature that invisibly changes the strategic elements of the game." [...] He reminisced over the qualities that made Gold and Silver truly unique, including the full color support, internal clock, Pokémon breeding, and PokéGear. Several months later, after DeVries had played through some of the game, he wrote, [...] "so far I <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> see, even if it all feels very familiar and formulaic at this point." ...|$|E
500|$|Similar {{to other}} artists that the {{director}} have worked with, Rolston usually brought his team of professionals along to the shooting, including make-up artist, wardrobe-hair stylist, dancers and choreographer. However, Rolston and his team turned out to cause a few creative conflicts with the group during production. One of them came from the original routine conducted by Watkins, {{the person who was}} in fact choreographed most of the group's early videos. She remembered Rolston's camp's choreographer Frank Gatson Jr. [...] "locked" [...] the girls out from providing ideas as they were practicing the new dance moves. The trio eventually dropped his choreograph because they thought his version wasn't their [...] "style of dancing." [...] But still, two of his moves were adapted in the final clip. [...] "To me, I didn't even think about, 'Well, can I really choreograph?' I was just like, 'Let me do my thing.' I just like to dance and I know when I <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> see. I like different kinds of stuff," [...] Watkins shared. The [...] "bend-down-and-jump-up" [...] dance that appears in the video was made up by Watkins to [...] "Foe Life", a song of Mack 10, the rapper whom she later married from 2000 to 2004.|$|E
500|$|Star Treks creator, Gene Roddenberry, who wielded {{significant}} influence despite his ill health, hated the script. Meyer's {{first meeting with}} Roddenberry resulted in Meyer storming {{out of the room}} within five minutes. As with Meyer's previous Star Trek film (The Wrath of Khan), the script had strong military overtones, with a naval theme present throughout. Far from being idealized, the characters were shown as bigoted and flawed. In contrast to Roddenberry's vision of the future, Meyer thought {{there was no evidence that}} bigotry would disappear by the 23rd century. When Roddenberry protested about the villainization of Saavik, Meyer replied that [...] "I created Saavik. She was not Gene's. If he doesn't <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> plan on doing with her, maybe he should give back the money he's made off my films. Maybe then I'll care what he has to say." [...] After the stormy first meeting, a group including Meyer, Roddenberry, and producer Ralph Winter discussed the revised draft. Roddenberry would voice his disapproval of elements of the script line by line, and he and Meyer would square off about them while Winter took notes. Overall, the tone of the meeting was conciliatory, but the producers ultimately ignored many of Roddenberry's concerns. By February 13, 1991, the film was officially put into production with the agreement it would be in theaters by the end of the year.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to Japanese musicians, several Irish artists contributed to Creid, including uilleann piper Davy Spillane—formerly of Moving Hearts and Riverdance—and Máire Breatnach, {{who had previously}} played fiddle on another Square album, Final Fantasy IV Celtic Moon. Mitsuda also asked guitarist Tomohiko Kira and singer Yoko Ueno to appear to the album after an acquaintance introduced him to them. [...] Hidenobu [...] "KALTA" [...] Ootsuki worked on the album as an arranger and felt his work was made easier by his familiarity with Mitsuda's music—Creid was his second arrangement project with Mitsuda, after , which he had worked on three years before. According to Ootsuki, Mitsuda and he were complementary in style, which resulted in an album leaving {{a lot of space}} and freedom for the listeners' imagination. He felt that, since Chrono Trigger, Mitsuda's musical style had changed to use less [...] "strong" [...] notes and include more sophistication; upon hearing the Xenogears tracks he [...] "literally" [...] "couldn't wait" [...] to arrange them. Mitsuda has described their collaborative style as that he would first create the [...] "basic backbone" [...] of the song and form the idea of how he wanted the song [...] "to turn out", then take the result to Ootsuki for them to arrange together. The end result would then be changed in the process of recording, as [...] "what sounds good on a synth module doesn't always sound good on live instruments", and occasionally the recording artists would [...] "ad-lib" [...] parts that would make it into the final product. Mitsuda generally also chose the specific percussion instruments to be used while recording, rather than beforehand; he feels that [...] "as long as the final product turns out to be <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want it to be, the process doesn't really matter too much". As working with the other artists gave him a sense of celebration, Mitsuda named the [...] "imaginary band" [...] of performers Millennial Fair and credited them as such in the album.|$|E
2500|$|A free {{relative}} clause, on {{the other}} hand, {{does not have an}} explicit antecedent external to itself. Instead, the relative clause itself takes the place of an argument in the matrix clause. For example, in the English sentence [...] "I <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> see", the clause what I see is a free relative clause, because it has no antecedent, but itself serves as the object of the verb like in the main clause. (An alternative analysis is that the free relative clause has zero as its antecedent.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, {{he founded}} the Silverlake Conservatory of Music, a school {{dedicated}} to help youth progress in music, because of this. [...] "I just wanted {{to fill the void}} that public education has cut from their curriculum. They've dropped the ball by cutting out music programs", Flea laments, [...] "I grew up in LA public schools and was in the music department. It was really an important thing for my life, it gave me something to hold onto, and it was an important access for me. Without music I would've gotten into a lot of trouble {{and there are a lot}} of kids like me out there. I just wanted to try to provide something <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> got." [...] Flea felt the public school system was seriously lacking in exposing children to music by drastically reducing, and sometimes eliminating, art-related programs.|$|E

5000|$|As a senior, Stone {{finished}} the season averaging 8.5 points, 7.5 rebounds, 5.3 assists, and 1.5 steals per game. In {{an article about}} the Legends Classic, a regular season tournament that UTEP participated in, Sports Illustrated writer Seth Davis commented that, [...] "I also <b>liked</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> saw out of 6-7 senior point guard Julyan Stone, though I'm mystified as to why he has not developed more of an offensive game.
