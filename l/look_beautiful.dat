5|$|It {{was against}} this {{backdrop}} that the Canadian Lady Corset Company had to act. In 1964, Moe Nadler died and his son, Larry Nadler inherited control of the company. Larry Nadler was a Harvard-trained MBA and brought modern marketing strategies to the industry. He commissioned market research that identified women's feelings about intimate apparel. Women did not hate their bras. Rather, they saw bras {{as a means to}} feel and <b>look</b> <b>beautiful,</b> to be fashionable and sexy, and to attract men. While women sometimes went braless, they were making a fashion choice and not a political statement. Canadian Lady's management knew that girdles were out, but bras would remain an essential part of women's wardrobes. So during the 1960s, while competitors were cutting back on their bra marketing and diversifying into other products, Canadian Lady aggressively pursued bra market share.|$|E

Vanderpump explained that they were contacted by Andy Cohen—who himself has a cameo appearance in [...] "G.U.Y."—from Bravo and were signed for side-roles in the video. Richards noticed that Gaga was a perfectionist on the set, with Vanderpump saying that the singer took charge of {{every detail of the}} production. They explained to The Hollywood Reporter that Gaga wanted the housewives to [...] "feel and <b>look</b> <b>beautiful</b> and fierce" [...] and during one of the homicide scenes she explained: [...] "I want you to whip that ponytail even more. Go back and really exaggerate your head-flipping'. I was like, 'Whatever you say'. [...] To get me into a lace bodysuit, there's not many people I'd do that for. I'm 53 years old, for God's sake. She said, 'This is what you're wearing'." [...] Richards personally wanted to play the guitar since she had been taking lessons.|$|E

In the [...] second line, Kathryn Duncan-Jones points out the reversal of the traditions of courtly love roles suggested most often.

After watching the first two minutes I had {{to turn it off}} and hide under the covers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Initially Davies and {{director}} Giacomo Campiotti clashed {{about how to}} present the material. Davies recalled, [...] "The first couple of weeks after Giacomo joined this project were horrendous for me because Zhivago {{has always been one}} of his very favorite books. He has always dreamed about filming it and has his own interpretation in his head. I can actually remember thinking after one long, long day, where we just didn't agree about a single thing, that it wasn't going to work—it's either got to be him or me. Somehow, we arrived at a compromise and I have almost forgotten what we were arguing about now, as now we are both very pleased with the script. I always knew that he would make it <b>look</b> <b>beautiful</b> because he has got a poet's vision and now, having seen the rushes and some cut footage, I feel like he is my favourite director of all time. Everything is delightful now... Giacomo Campiotti's direction makes it extraordinary." ...|$|E
2500|$|Channing {{made her}} {{television}} debut on Sesame Street {{in the role}} of The Number Painter's female victim.

For the role, Channing went through considerable transformation, with the syndicated column [...] "TV Scout" [...] reporting months later, [...] "It was a great make-up job — at least the part that made very pretty Stockard look so ugly. She had her cheeks puffed out with cotton and her nose was wadded, too, to make it thick and off-center. Very thick eyebrows were drawn on her face and she wore padded clothes to make her look fat. Making her <b>look</b> <b>beautiful</b> was easy." [...] The TV movie has gone on to enjoy cult status, becoming available on DVD in 2005.|$|E
