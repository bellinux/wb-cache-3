Usually this is not what the beginner programmer intended. Thus, SKILL novices usually incorrectly think of car (mylist) as a syntax error.|$|E

50|$|The Amstrad PCW family {{contains}} a Display <b>List</b> <b>function</b> called the 'Roller RAM'. This is a 512-byte RAM area consisting of 256 16-bit vectors into RAM, {{one for each}} line of the 720 × 256 pixel display. Each vector identifies the location of 90 bytes of monochrome pixels that hold the line's 720 pixel states. The 90 bytes of 8 pixel states are actually spaced at 8-byte intervals, so there are 7 unused bytes between each byte of pixel data. This suits how the text-orientated PCW constructs a typical screen buffer in RAM, where the first character's 8 rows are stored in the first 8 bytes, the second character's rows in the next 8 bytes and so on. The Roller RAM was implemented to speed up display scrolling {{as it would have}} been unacceptably slow for its 3.4 MHz Z80 to move up the 23 KB display buffer 'by hand' i.e. in software. The Roller RAM starting entry used {{at the beginning of a}} screen refresh is controlled by a Z80-writable I/O register. Therefore, the screen can be scrolled simply by changing this I/O register.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} generic recursion {{schemes for}} programs which recurse over multiple inductive structures simultaneously, such as equality, zip and the nth {{element of a}} <b>list</b> <b>function.</b> Such schemes have been notably absent from previous work. This paper defines a uniform mechanism for defining such programs and shows that these programs satisfy generic theorems. These theorems are the basis for an automatic improvement algorithm. This algorithm is an improvement over the algorithm presented earlier [14] because, in addition to inducting over multiple structures, it {{can be incorporated into}} any algebraic language and is no longer restricted to a "safe" subset. 1 Introduction In previous work [14, 15, 6, 4, 5] we have shown how programming algebraically with generic recursion schemes provides a theory amenable to program calculation [13]. This theory provides a basis for automatic optimization techniques which capture many well-known transformations. Unfortunately, these recursion sc [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work is to study the effects that supply and demand factors have on waiting lists. With this aim in mind, the authors discuss a model which explains the factors that can affect the production of healthcare, demand for healthcare, and finally, the inequalities between healthcare supply and demand. This analysis proves that, due to imbalances between supply and demand, there is an excess of demand that is equal to waiting lists. This demand excess is called the waiting <b>list</b> <b>function.</b> Hence, {{the second part of}} this paper develops an empirical analysis which estimates the function for the waiting lists of Spanish Public Hospitals for the period 1996 - 2009. As a result of the estimation, the supply and demand factors influencing waiting lists, as well as their evolution, are determined and studied. An imbalance between supply and demand reduces the supply and increases demand resulting in the amount traded by the market being less than potential demand...|$|E
40|$|Stream Fusion is {{a system}} for {{removing}} intermediate list data structures from functional programs, in particular Haskell. This entry adapts stream fusion to Isabelle/HOL and its code generator. We define stream types for finite and possibly infinite lists and stream versions {{for most of the}} fusible <b>list</b> <b>functions</b> in the theories List and Coinductive-List, and prove them cor-rect with respect to the conversion <b>functions</b> between <b>lists</b> and streams. The Stream Fusion transformation itself is implemented as a simproc in the pre-processor of the code generator. Brian Huffman’s AFP entry [3] formalises stream fusion in HOLCF for the domain of lazy lists to prove the GHC compiler rewrite rules correct. In contrast, this work enables Isabelle’s code generator to perform stream fusion itself. To that end, it covers both finite and coinductive lists from the HOL library and the Coinductive entry. The fusible <b>list</b> <b>functions</b> require specification and proof principles different from Huffman’s. ...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{successful}} programs of the UNESCO is the World Heritage Program, which aims to protect outstanding cultural and natural values. Being present on the World Heritage List is not only considered to be an honour, but it can also mean a significant economic advantage for a settlement. The sites on the List usually become the primary attractions of a country as they benefit from specific marketing and protection. Becoming famous at an international level usually raises the tourist’s attention in a greater extent and also makes the tourists show a greater aptitude for visiting these sites [MICHALKÓ 2007]. Whether the number of tourists actually increases depends to a great extend on the territories’ potentialities to receive tourists. Besides the accommodation and the supply various and enjoyable entertainment facilities and programs are also needed. It is a general view that the sites on the World Heritage <b>List</b> <b>function</b> as tourist attractions and consequently they cause {{a significant increase in the}} tourist traffic of the settlement and its surrounding territory as well.

The starting point {{of this study is to}} demonstrate how the pelvis is often subject to large power transmission through sports activities and thus may predispose athletes for sacroiliac joints dysfunction. Purpose and Objectives: Does manipulation of SA Joint in combination with supervised exercise and cognitive approach effect on long-term hamstring injury among soccer players? Material and Methods: We included two athletes (n = 2), but one got sick during the study (n = 1). It was used a "Single-Subject Experimental Design" (ssed) with 2 -week baseline, 7 weeks of intervention, and final measurements after 2 weeks. Interventions were, high velocity, low amplitude manipulation approaches (HVLA manipulation) / mobilization, with supervised exercise and cognitive approach. Participants logged adherence. Pain was recorded throughout the tests 11 -point numeric rating scale (11 PNRS), Maitland's lumbar slumps. Local function was measured by the Active Straight Leg Raise (ASLR), Oswestry <b>List</b> <b>function</b> limitations, version 2 (ODI), Straight Leg Raising (SLR). Results: The study shows a tendency for manipulation in combination with supervised exercise and cognitive approach may be effective in the rehabilitation of long-term hamstring injury. The results after a 7 -week intervention period showed that the subject had no pain, normal neural tension, normal local function and disability in daily life and about normal hamstring flexibility. Conclusion: The results of a ssed can not be generalized and range with only one test subject is very small. There is a need for RCTs in this area, including in relation to the classification of subgroups that can make lower back and pelvic girdle pain research more feasible...|$|E

40|$|Since its {{emergence}} in late December 2010, the Arab Spring narrative {{has sparked}} many controversies among researchers, commentators, analysts, and scholars from different disciplines {{around the world}} in terms of the causes and the reasons behind it and even its name: ‘Arab Spring’. This study explores the Arab Spring narrative from its emergence to its continuing dénouement in the English and Arabic mainstream news media from corpus-linguistic and critical discourse analytic perspectives. The Arab Spring bilingual corpus consists of two main sub-corpora, English and Arabic, compiled from LexisNexis and other news websites. Totalling 15, 088 articles and 11, 522, 846 words, the English sub-corpus consists of 7, 018 texts with total of 5, 901, 416 words, while the Arabic sub-corpus comprises 8, 070 news texts and a total of 5, 621, 430 words. Taken from prominent news media outlets from Western, Arab and Islamic countries, and divided into two major text types (news and editorials and opinions) with date range coverage from 15 June 2010 until 31 August 2013, it allows us to diachronically and synchronically examine the discursive construction of the Arab Spring narrative. Combining quantitative and qualitative methods associated with Corpus Linguistics (CL) and Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), the current study explores the key topics associated with the Arab Spring at both the linguistic as well as the semantic levels by means of frequency, keyword (KKW <b>list</b> <b>function</b> in my case), collocation list functions and concordance. Analysis also identifies the main news actors and news values. Actors and events are represented, negatively and positively by means of lexical choice, and the different presentation strategies indicate that many of the Arab Spring news stories are politically, socially, and ideologically polarized. The contrasting themes/concepts within the resulting semantic categories (by means of pairs of items with positive/negative connotations) are also prevalent. For example, at the lexical level the following contrasting pairs are revealed: democracy/dictatorship; religious, sectarian/secular; peace/ violence; government/regime; allies/enemy; corruption/ reform, opposition/ support. Similarly, at the grammatical level items, such as pro/anti, is/non- and not, also indicate the contrastive as well as the polarizing nature of the Arab Spring narrative...|$|E
40|$|Background: Myfood 24 {{is a new}} online 24 h dietary {{assessment}} tool developed for use among the UK population. Limited information {{is available on the}} usability and acceptability of such tools. Hence this study aims to determine the usability and acceptability of myfood 24 among British adolescents (11 - 18 y) before and after making the improvements. Methods: A total of 84 adolescents were involved in two stages. In stage-I (beta-version of myfood 24), 14 adolescents were recruited, 7 of whom (group- 1) were asked to enter standardized tasks in a testing room with screen capture software. The remaining 7 -adolescents (group- 2) were asked to report their previous food intake using myfood 24 at home. All participants then completed a usability and acceptability questionnaire. Stage-II was carried out after making amendments to the live-version of myfood 24 in which 70 adolescents were asked to enter their food intake for two days and then complete the same questionnaire. Thematic analysis was conducted of observer comments and open-ended questions. Results: Navigation, presentation errors and failure to find functions were the main usability issues identified in the beta-version. Significant improvements were found in the usability and acceptability of most functions after implementing certain features like a spell checker, auto-fill option, and adding ‘mouse hover’ to help with the use of some functions. Adolescents’ perceptions of searching food items, selecting food portion sizes and making a <b>list</b> <b>function</b> were significantly improved in the live-version. The mean completion time of myfood 24 reduced from 31 (SD[*]=[*] 6) minutes in the beta-version to 16 (SD[*]=[*] 5) minutes in the live-version. The mean system usability score (SUS) of myfood 24 improved from 66 / 100 (95 % CI 60, 73) in the beta-version to 74 / 100 (95 % CI 71, 77) in the live-version, which is considered as ‘good’. Of the adolescents in stage-II, 41 % preferred using myfood 24 to the interviewer-administered 24 h recall because myfood 24 was quicker, easier to use and provided the adolescents with privacy when reporting dietary intake. Conclusion: Considering adolescents’ feedback has helped in improving the usability and acceptability of the final-version of myfood 24. myfood 24 appears to support adolescents’ need in reporting their dietary intake, which may potentially improve the overall quality of adolescents’ self-reported dietary information...|$|E
