5|$|Some {{crop plants}} are hybrids from {{different}} genera (intergeneric hybrids), such as Triticale, × Triticosecale, a wheat–rye hybrid. Most modern and ancient wheat breeds are themselves hybrids; bread wheat, Triticum aestivum, is a hexaploid hybrid of three wild grasses. Several commercial fruits including <b>loganberry</b> (Rubus × loganobaccus) and grapefruit (Citrus × paradisi) are hybrids, as are garden herbs such as peppermint (Mentha × piperita), and trees {{such as the}} London plane (Platanus × acerifolia). Among many natural plant hybrids is Iris albicans, a sterile hybrid that spreads by rhizome division, and Oenothera lamarckiana, a flower that {{was the subject of}} important experiments by Hugo de Vries that produced an understanding of polyploidy.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of Scania belongs to the European hardwood vegetation zone, a considerable part of which is now agricultural rather than the original forest. This zone covers Europe west of Poland and north of the Alps, and includes the British Isles, northern and central France and the countries and regions {{to the south and}} southeast of the North Sea up to Denmark. A smaller north-eastern part of Scania is part of the pinewood vegetation zone, in which spruce grows naturally. Within the larger part, pine may grow together with birch on sandy soil. The most common tree is beech. Other common trees are willow, oak, ash, alder and elm (which until the 1970s formed a few forests but now is heavily infected by the elm disease). Also rather southern trees like walnut tree, chestnut and hornbeam can be found. In parks horse chestnut, lime and maple are commonly planted as well. Common fruit trees planted in commercial orchards and private gardens include several varieties of apple, pear, cherry and plum; strawberries are commercially cultivated in many locations across the province. Examples of wild berries grown in domesticated form are blackberry, raspberry, cloudberry (in the north-east), blueberry, wild strawberry and <b>loganberry.</b>|$|E

40|$|Oregon is {{the number}} one {{producer}} of blackberries, Boysenberries and <b>Loganberries</b> in the United States. The dominant type of blackberry grown in Oregon is the trailing type which has long, pliable canes and includes several popular cultivars. Other types of blackberries are the erect and semi-erect, but their acreage is small (about 6 % to 8 % of the total blackberry acreage). Boysenberries and <b>Loganberries</b> are also trailing berries but are hybrids (a cross between a blackberry and a raspberry) and are often grouped with blackberries because they have similar plant morphology, production practices, and pests. ● In 2001, Oregon growers produced 36. 1 million pounds of blackberries on 6, 160 acres, with a farm-gate value of $ 14, 042, 000; 4. 2 million pounds of Boysenberries on 1, 380 acres, with a value of $ 2, 583, 000; and 0. 1 million pounds of <b>Loganberries</b> on 70 acres, with a value of $ 50, 000. ● 90 to 95 % of the blackberry crop is processed (frozen, puree, jam, or canned) with the remainder being sold for fresh market. Fresh market berries are generally sold locally while processed berries are sold and used nationally and internationally. ● Average yield per acre of all blackberries is about 6, 000 to 8, 000 pounds, but differences between cultivars do occur and yields can range from 4, 000 to 10, 000 pounds per acre depending on the cultivar. Trailing blackberries are sensitive to cold winter temperatures and hot summer temperatures, each of which can have an adverse effect on yield. ● Production costs for established blackberries range from $ 3, 000 to $ 3, 700 per acre. Production Regions (11, 12) : Almost all of Oregon's blackberries are grown west of the Cascade Mountains in the Willamette Valley. Fertile soils, mild winters and cool summers allow growers to produce high quality berries with good flavor and color. Marion County has the most blackberry acreage in the state (approximately 50 %) ...|$|R

40|$|Rubus stunt is an {{economically}} important {{disease in the}} production of raspberries, blackberries, and <b>loganberries.</b> A fast, sensitive, and reliable diagnosis of phytoplasmas, the causal agent of the disease, is of prime importance to stop its spread by vegetative propagation and by insect vectors. Therefore, multiplex qPCR assays using TaqMan probes with different kinds of fluorophores in one reaction were developed, allowing the detection of phytoplasmas in general as well as a more specific detection of phytoplasmas belonging to group 16 SrV and host DNA (either plant or insect). This assay now provides a practical tool for the screening of motherplants and monitoring the presence and distribution of phytoplasmas in Rubus plants of different geographic origins, cultivars, and cultivation systems, as well as in putative insect vectors like leafhoppers...|$|R
50|$|Dandelion {{is popular}} as a salad {{ingredient}} in Slovenia {{and has been}} gathered in the fields for centuries. Even today dandelion and potato salad is highly valued. Since it can be picked only {{for a short time}} in early spring, much is made of it. Families go on dandelion picking expeditions, and pick enough for a whole week. In the Middle Ages people ate acorns and other forest fruits, particularly in times of famine. Chestnuts were valued, and served as basis for many outstanding dishes. Walnuts and hazelnuts are used in cakes and desserts. Wild strawberries, <b>loganberries,</b> blackberries, bilbeberries were a rich source of vitamins. Mushrooms have always been popular, and Slovenians liked picking and eating them. There are many varieties. Honey was used to a considerable extent.
