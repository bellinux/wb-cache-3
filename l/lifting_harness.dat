50|$|The {{deck of the}} Antietam {{served as}} the {{launching}} pad for the stratospheric balloon flight of Commander Malcolm D. Ross and Lieutenant Commander Victor A. Prather, both of the United States Navy, on 4 May 1961. This flight set an absolute official altitude record for manned balloons of 113,740 ft. The flight took place over the Gulf of Mexico. During recovery, Prather slipped from the rescue helicopter's <b>lifting</b> <b>harness,</b> fell into the ocean, and died from his injuries onboard Antietam. Commander Ross was successfully recovered.|$|E
50|$|Lifting {{equipment}}, {{also known}} as lifting gear, is a general term for any equipment {{that can be used}} to lift loads. This includes jacks, block and tackle, vacuum lifts, hoists, rotating screws, gantries, A frames, gin poles, shear legs, sheerleg, windlasses, <b>lifting</b> <b>harnesses,</b> fork <b>lifts,</b> hydraulic lifting pads, air lift bags, and cranes.|$|R
50|$|His {{favorite}} lifts {{were the}} Heavy Lifts, {{such as the}} <b>Harness</b> <b>Lift</b> and the Back Lift, and Finger Lifts. In front of witnesses, he lifted 3,985 pounds (1807 kg)in the <b>Harness</b> <b>Lift</b> and 4,140 pounds (1880 kg)in the Back Lift. In 1907, he lifted 667 pounds (303 kg) with one finger.|$|R
5000|$|The current balloon flight {{record was}} set by Malcolm Ross (USNR) and Victor Prather (USN), {{who took the}} Strato-Lab V balloon to 34,668 m (113,740 ft) on May 4, 1961 above the Gulf of Mexico. The balloonists landed successfully, but Victor Prather slipped from the {{helicopter}} <b>lift</b> <b>harness</b> while being transferred to a waiting aircraft carrier, and he drowned before US Navy divers could rescue him. Nicholas Piantanida, while attempting to set a new skydiving jump record, is claimed to have reached 123,800 feet (37.73 km) on February 2, 1966. Piantanida was unable to disconnect his breathing apparatus from the gondola, so the ground crew jettisoned the balloon at the flight ceiling. Piantanida's attempt did not set a flight record because he descended without the balloon.|$|R
50|$|Tripoli {{returned}} to Vietnam at Danang early in October and loaded 39 defective CH-46A helicopters for transportation to Okinawa, where their tail pylons {{were to be}} replaced. Shortly after she departed Danang on 7 October, her lookout spied an Air Force F-105 Thunderchief, which crashed into the sea about two miles (3 km) ahead. One of her helicopters flew to the scene, rescued the pilot, and returned him to the ship for medical treatment. Not long thereafter, her lookouts caught sight of a second survivor of the crash. By the time her helicopter arrived on the scene, an Air Force chopper had already picked up the man. Tripolis helicopter assisted in the operation by taking on board the Air Force crewman who had jumped in to assist the survivor into the <b>lift</b> <b>harness.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Bernese Mountain Dogs have {{an unusually}} high {{mortality}} due to musculoskeletal causes. Arthritis, hip dysplasia, and cruciate ligament rupture were reported {{as the cause of}} death in 6% of Bernese Mountain Dogs in the UK study; for comparison, mortality due to musculoskeletal ailments was reported to be less than 2% for pure-bred dogs in general. Owners of Bernese Mountain Dogs are nearly three times as likely as owners of other breeds to report musculoskeletal problems in their dogs; the most commonly reported being cruciate ligament rupture, arthritis (especially in shoulders and elbows), hip dysplasia, and osteochondritis. [...] The age at onset for musculoskeletal problems is also unusually low. In the U.S./Canada study, 11% of living dogs had arthritis at an average age of 4.3 years. [...] Most other common, non-musculoskeletal morbidity issues strike Berners at rates similar to other breeds. Prospective Bernese Mountain Dog owners should be prepared to cope with a large dog that may have mobility problems at a young age. Options to help mobility-impaired dogs may include ramps for car or house access, <b>lifting</b> <b>harnesses</b> and slings, and dog wheelchairs (ex: Walkin` Wheels). Comfortable bedding may help alleviate joint pain.|$|R

Unpublished manuscript, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS. Edwin BrokeshThe Kansas State University (KSU) Cadaver Dissection Team (CDT) {{is challenged}} to provide comprehensive human anatomy demonstrations to regular lab students. However, {{to see all}} structures adequately, the cadaver must be flipped over. Attempting to rotate a 300 -pound cadaver without proper aid may result in labor injury, cadaver tissue damage, compromised lab spaces, and lost preservatives. The Rotational Anatomy Senior Design team is creating a system to help the CDT lift and rotate their cadavers. This design project was broken into two categories: <b>harness</b> and <b>lift.</b> The <b>harness</b> interfaces with the cadavers, while the lift is the supporting structure connecting to the harness and instigating rotational movement. After designing multiple frameworks for the lift, the team ran numerous Finite Element Analysis (FEA) models representing a concentrated static force slightly larger than that produced by the maximum cadaver weight via SolidWorks Simulation. This showed that the lift designed was able to withstand {{the weight of a}} 330 -pound cadaver with minimal to no flexion. Rotational Anatomy also created a harness that distributes the cadaver's weight by wrapping around the legs and continuing up the shoulders, keeping the cadaver both stable and horizontal during lift and rotation. Upon installing the electric winch system, the <b>lift</b> and <b>harness</b> designs will be thoroughly tested with CDT's current cadavers and volunteer design team members. The criteria for successful testing are: 1) less than 1 / 16 " flexion for framework means it is safe and stable and 2) no tears or ripped seams on harness means it is durable and appropriate. Time permitting, the framework will undergo polishing touches: rubber trimming to mitigate wall damage, and a powder coating to deter rust after years of use. Upon timely and successful test results, both the <b>lift</b> and the <b>harness</b> will be implemented in the Cadaver Dissection Lab by May 2015...|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} things that can cause the warp threads not to {{separate}} cleanly, and thus produce a poor shed. A slack warp, threads set too closely in the reed, or increase of friction on the first foot or so of the warp where the threads were handled all cause poor sheds. Fuzzy yarns like mohair can also cause a poor shed. To get a better shed the weaver can <b>lift</b> the <b>harnesses</b> while the reed is against the fabric, or raise only one harness at a time. By weaving in a different manner sometimes a good shed can be created. The weaver can also insert a stick into the shed to clear it, and make way for the shuttle though this option is time-consuming.|$|R
50|$|Two {{different}} shedding {{methods were}} {{developed for the}} harness loom-one where any one harness or combination of <b>harnesses</b> was <b>lifted</b> while the other harnesses remained stationary. This type of loom {{is known as a}} rising shed loom, and examples include the table loom, dobby loom or the Jack loom. The other method used in harness looms is where some harnesses are raised while others are lowered. The second method lessened the effort of <b>lifting</b> the selected <b>harnesses</b> because they no longer needed to be raised as high as in a rising shed loom. Counterbalance and countermarch looms are of this second type.|$|R
50|$|When Reeves saw Bill Kazmaier win {{his third}} World's Strongest Man title in 1982, on BBC television, {{he decided that}} would be his aim, and took up weights. By 1986 he had become the Yorkshire and North East powerlifting {{champion}} in the superheavy class. In addition to powerlifting he had become actively involved in strength athletics and in 1986 won the National Truck Pulling Championships (sponsored by ASA/Bristol Street Motors) and came second to Peter Tregloan in 1986 in the Midland's Strongest Man competition. In 1987 he improved on his second-place finish by winning the Midland's Strongest Man ({{the first of three}} consecutive wins). That year he also won the first of three consecutive Yorkshire's Strongest Man competitions and won the England's Strongest Man competition also. In 1988 he took the title of East Britain's Strongest Man and entered John Smith's Trial of Strength, a competition organised by Geoff Capes and David Webster in order to find the successor to the retired Capes. He won the title, the equivalent that year of Britain's Strongest Man. Underlining his calibre, he then broke Tom Topham's 274-year-old record by <b>harness</b> <b>lifting</b> three beer barrels weighing a total of 845 kg.|$|R
