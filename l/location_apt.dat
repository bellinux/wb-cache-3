50|$|Shortly after Extended Jurisdiction {{came into}} force, the US September 11 attacks {{completely}} changed {{the national security}} landscape and al-Qaeda/Islamist terrorism became the MDP's principle threat. The MDP already extensively “working outside the wire” formed a number of Area Police Teams (APT), which were teams of mobile officers who would undertake mobile armed counter-terrorism patrols and local crime surge operations of the Defence Estate and defence interests. Prior to this, the force had been organised around Operational Command Units (OCU) based on static Defence <b>locations.</b> The <b>APTs</b> were never adequately funded and quickly, due to pressure on the Defence Budget in 2004, by both the Iraq and Afghanistan campaigns, these teams were rationalised to work at Divisional not Area level and became known as Divisional Support Groups (DSG) a role which continues today.|$|R
50|$|Much of the {{residential}} and commercial development in Toda is due to its proximity {{to the city of}} Tokyo and the efficient commuter rail links available. This has enabled Toda to act as a bedroom community of Tokyo and is thus an <b>apt</b> <b>location</b> of residence for those who wish to work in the Tokyo Metropolis. There has been a continuous increase in population since the construction of the three Saikyo Line stations in the 1980s and this has had a positive effect on the economy and development of the city.|$|R

50|$|It {{was officially}} {{launched}} on 5 January 2012 in Hyderabad. The first schedule was held in Hyderabad itself. The pooja and Muhurtham shot was done in IRCT College Gachibowli RTTC Bhavan Gachibowli. Exclusively for the songs the crew went to Bangkok and shot the songs in the most beautiful <b>locations</b> which are <b>apt</b> for the songs. Another large portion was filmed in Tirupathi for the want of the village environment & serenity. A parody song was shot with all {{the characters in the}} Movie in the sets of Manikonda Hyderabad. The CG work was done in Thinksmart a Post production company owned by Vishnu Manchu himself. A song featuring over 50 junior artists and Vishnu was shot in beaches of Bangkok. In fact most of the film was shot in sets of Manikonda which costed a whopping sum of more than 5 Crores. The shooting of this movie is going on in and around Hyderabad for past few days. The director is filming the climax scenes on Vishnu Manchu, Hansika Motwani, Kota Srinivasa Rao, Brahmanandam and the goons.With this schedule the completed except for songs and some talkie part. G.Nageswara Reddy, who has a brand name of comedy films director is directing this out and out comedy entertainer. Hansika Motwani is paired up with Vishnu Manchu {{for the first time in}} her career. Yuvan Shankar Raja & Chakri are scoring the music and audio of the movie will be released soon after the completion of shoot. Kona Venkat is the script writer for this film.

40|$|As {{with the}} {{majority}} of Johannesburg areas, the Newtown Electric Power Station Heritage Precinct does not fully realise its potential for spatial relations facilitating creative means of living. Creativity is a powerful tool to engage present and future possibilities. A Centre to stimulate creativity will benefit the direct area users, as well as contribute to the prominence of the historical and cultural richness of Newtown. The vacant site adjacent to the Sci-Bono Discovery Centre provides an <b>apt</b> <b>location</b> for the Creativity Centre as the intervening programme will activate, strengthen and define the presently underutilised street corner edges. The proposed architectural spaces aim to direct the site’s current movement routes created by pedestrian commuters, in order for creativity to become more ingrained in daily life. The proposed architectural elements aim to facilitate creative activities - both curatorial and organically inspired through community appropriation of specifically designed open, or adaptable, spaces. The Centre aims to become a creative community gathering hub: becoming integral to the existing creative individuals currently pursuing artistic practices in Newtown. Gesamtkunstwerk theoretically guides the project: in terms of the architectural intervention being comprised of singular elements all contributing to a greater whole. Gesamtkunstwerk also programmatically unites the entire Electric Power Station city block, through promoting the unification of art forms with life, as a holistic, creative entity. The Centre acts as a crucial beacon highlighting the importance of creativity in the contemporary South African situation where it is undervalued and underutilised. It also articulates that as a directorial element of societal authorisations and processes, architectural design should articulate the value of creativity through facilitating and inspiring creative modes of living.

40|$|Analysis of {{structural}} function can {{provide insight into}} the technological development of the skeleton frame. cation of a specific technology at a time when that technology was new and developing rapidly. The era of rapid development was the 1880 s and 1890 s. At the beginning of this period, all tall buildings had ex-terior bearing walls; at its end, few did. Examining the technology of tall build-ings during the 20 years after 1880 illustrates the introduction and develop-ment of steel-framing technology. By using primary examples from one city, the evolution of the types of frames can be illustrated without complications from different building codes. Examples from Philadelphia are used in this paper in keeping with the <b>location</b> of the <b>APT</b> Delaware Valley symposium where this analysis was first presented. The introduction of engineering into historical analysis of structures is gain-ing popularity. The typical analysis is reverse engineering, where the design parameters are determined from the object, but can include feasibility study and functional analysis. Justin Spivey has described in detail the fifth project in which the Historic American Engineer-ing Record used engineering analysis as part of a study and report, but the HAER examples focus on bridges, not buildings. 2 Similar analysis of historic buildings is a useful addition to conser-vation only when it takes into account the often-hidden load paths in building structures. Part of the acceptance and maturity of a specific technology is agreement among those involved on the meaning of the words and concepts that describe that technology. 3 In examining past developments it is important to make a distinction between the definitions of crucial terms {{at the time of the}} develop-ment and the definition of those same terms now, not only to avoid stumbling over preconceptions of what the devel...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2010 This {{collection}} of three manuscripts serves to improve methods for collecting, interpreting, and utilizing autocorrelated data from headwater stream networks. Each stream network {{is comprised of}} linear segments. These segments lie within a unique branching structure that connects the segments via flowing water, and the connectivity provided by water varies seasonally. These aspects separate stream networks from other landscapes, and provide unique challenges to the statistical analysis of stream-based phenomenon. Two chapters of this work relied on a unique and comprehensive set of data. These data constitute a complete census of habitat unit fish counts from 40 randomly selected headwater basins in western Oregon. The first objective of this work was to evaluate how different sampling designs captured spatial autocorrelation, given the samples were drawn from a population of spatially autocorrelated observations. Spatially distributed clusters of sampling <b>locations</b> were more <b>apt</b> to capture spatial autocorrelation than samples without clusters or small clusters located at tributary junctions. A similar investigation was made concerning sampling design performance in relation to estimating autocorrelation function values. All sampling designs lead generally to negatively biased estimates, and practical differences among the sampling designs were not observed. The second objective was to investigate spatial autocorrelation model range parameters as measures of patch sizes. It is common practice to use range parameters to infer the size of patches within spatially autocorrelated data, but this methodology lacks sufficient justification. The census data were used to compute range parameter values, and another proposed autocorrelative measure of patch size: the integral scale. The same data were used to compute patch sizes under several patch definitions, {{and the relationship of}} range parameters and integral scale values with patch sizes was explored. Range parameter values did not equal and were not strongly correlated with average patch sizes, though range parameter values were more correlated with maximum patch and gap sizes. Integral scale values matched the magnitude of, but were not strongly correlated with, average patch sizes. The third objective was to refine the analysis of temporally autocorrelated hydrology data from paired watershed studies. Paired watershed studies are used to evaluate forest harvesting effects on stream biota and hydrology (i. e. fish, amphibians, insects, stream flow, and sediment yield). Traditionally, treatment effects are discerned using prediction intervals. This work provided an improved method for constructing prediction intervals for use in change detection in paired watershed studies. The improved prediction intervals included variation associated with estimating linear and autocorrelation model parameters...|$|R
