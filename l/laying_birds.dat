Experiments has shown that feather pecking, cannibalism and nesting behaviour can be improved by selection. A search for alternative breeds/hybrids has not yet given the ideal "Organic hen".

50|$|All poultrymen {{should realize}} that there are no known {{substitutes}} for sunshine and young green grass in keeping poultry in the best possible state of health and in promoting growth and maintaining egg production. Where sunshine and green grass cannot be provided, {{as in the case of}} birds kept in strict confinement, the best possible substitutes must be provided. In the case of most farm and many commercial flocks, however, the growing stock is reared on range, and the adult birds are given yards or allowed to roam at will.If the staggering losses among growing chicks and <b>laying</b> <b>birds</b> that occur annually are to be reduced materially, better methods of flock management must be employed. The losses from mortality are due largely to internal parasites and diseases of one kind or another. Bare ground over which the chickens have run for some time, mud puddles, and stagnant water are the chief sources of the spread of diseases, most of which are filth borne....The mortality that usually occurs in growing and adult stock may be materially reduced by providing the birds with an alternate yarding system. Probably the best arrangement is to provide each colony brooder and each laying house with three yards (3 m) which the birds would be allowed to use every 3 or 4 weeks. By alternating the birds in the yards every 3 or 4 weeks each yard is kept reasonably sanitary, especially if the soil in the immediate vicinity of the house is cultivated and treated with lime, and young green grass is available for the birds throughout the season. The importance of clean range for both birds and adult stock cannot be emphasized too strongly... For adult stock a good grass sward can be maintained on fertile soil, allowing about 200 birds to the acre m² per hen.|$|E

There were differences between strains of <b>laying</b> <b>bird</b> in feed intake, rate of lay, egg and yolk weights and egg cholesterol content.

40|$|Reproductive success within populations often {{varies with}} the timing of breeding, {{typically}} declining over the season. This variation is usually attributed to seasonal changes in resource availability and/or differences in the quality or experience of breeders. In colonial species, the timing of breeding may be of particular importance because {{the costs and benefits}} of colonial breeding are likely to vary over the season and also with colony size. In this study, we examine the relationship between timing of breeding and reproductive performance (clutch size and nest success) both within and between variable sized colonies (n = 18) of fairy martins, Petrochelidon ariel. In four of these colonies, we also experimentally delayed laying in selected nests to disentangle the effects of laying date and individual quality/experience on reproductive success. Within colonies, later <b>laying</b> <b>birds</b> produced smaller clutches, but only in larger colonies. The general seasonal decline in nest success was also more pronounced in larger colonies. Late <b>laying</b> <b>birds</b> were generally smaller than earlier <b>laying</b> <b>birds,</b> but morphological differences were also related to colony size, suggesting optimal colony size also varies with phenotype. Experimentally delayed clutches were larger than concurrently produced non-delayed clutches, but only in larger colonies. Similarly, delayed clutches were more likely to produce fledglings, particularly later in the season and in larger colonies. We suggest that the reduced performance of late breeding pairs in larger colonies resulted primarily from inexperienced/low quality birds preferring to settle in larger colonies, possibly exacerbated by an increase in the costs of coloniality (e. g., resource depletion and ectoparasite infestations) with date and colony size. These findings highlight the importance of phenotype-related differences in settlement decisions and reproductive performance to an improved understanding of colonial breeding and variation in colony size. 12 page(s...|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of {{producing}} monoclonal antibodies to turkey prolactin, three monoclonal antibodies to turkey chromogranin A (CgA) were also produced, apparently arising from minor contamination of the turkey prolactin immunogen with peptide fragments of CgA. The identity of the antigen recognized by these antibodies was established by tandem mass spectrometry de novo sequencing of seven tryptic peptides from a turkey pituitary protein purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. These peptides showed high homology with distinctly separate regions of mammalian and ostrich CgA, and in silico cloned chicken CgA sequences. Chromogranin A immunostaining patterns on Western blots and pituitary tissue sections differed from those of prolactin, growth hormone, or luteinizing hormone (LH). Dual-label fluorescent immunohistochemistry revealed that CgA was co-localized with LH in most avian gonadotrophs in young chickens and turkeys, but not in adult, <b>laying</b> <b>birds.</b> Conversely, CgA {{was found in a}} majority of somatotrophs in <b>laying</b> <b>birds</b> but was absent from somatotrophs in young, growing chickens and turkeys. Lactotrophs contained no detectable CgA immunoreactivity in the tissues studied. These results suggest that CgA may modulate hormone secretion by gonadotrophs and somatotrophs in a manner that differs between cell type with age or reproductive state.

40|$|RECOGNITION of the {{importance}} of- the estimation of serum or plasma phosphatase as a somewhat earlier indica-tion {{of the severity of}} rickets than the con-centrations of calcium and phosphorus in the serum has resulted in considerable work on this enzyme. Though relatively few reports are avail-able which deal with the blood phosphatase of the fowl, our knowledge of the enzyme has been considerably broadened by numer-ous studies on mammals. The possible func-tion of phosphatase in the growth and dis-ease of bone has been reviewed by Kay (1932) and has received attention in a symposium on ossification (1933). It has been shown by Hall and King (1931) and King and Hall (1931) that the tissue phos-phatase extracts of fowls react in a man-ner similar to those of mammals.
