5|$|Cyathus stercoreus {{has been}} {{investigated}} {{for its ability to}} break down <b>lignin</b> and cellulose in agricultural byproducts, like wheat straw or grasses. It selectively breaks down <b>lignin,</b> leaving much of the cellulose intact, which increases the amount of digestible carbohydrate for ruminant mammals, and enhances both its value as a food source and its biodegradability. The enzymes responsible, laccase and manganese peroxidase, also have industrial applications for <b>lignin</b> degradation and removal in the pulp and paper industry. Liquid cultures of C.stercoreus have also been shown to biodegrade the explosive compound 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT).|$|E
5|$|Carrots are 88% water, 4.7% sugar, 0.9% protein, 2.8% {{dietary fiber}}, 1% ash and 0.2% fat. Carrot dietary fiber {{comprises}} mostly cellulose, with smaller proportions of hemicellulose, <b>lignin</b> and starch. Free sugars in carrot include sucrose, glucose and fructose.|$|E
5|$|The Amylostereaceae {{are white}} rot pathogens. They {{disintegrate}} the <b>lignin</b> {{of the host}} wood, whereby the infested wood parts become less stable and take a fibrous structure. The wood bleaches as fungal enzymes break down and remove the brown-pigmented <b>lignin.</b> The distribution in wood takes place mainly along the transport channels in the xylem. If the wood is crosscut, the red rot is vertically positioned, on which bleached, infested areas contrast with intact wood. Symptoms of infestion by the symbiotic partner—wood wasps—include circular exit holes in the crust and acute stress through dryness, common in hanging, falling or tanning needles.|$|E
40|$|Recycled {{polystyrene}} and Kraft <b>lignins</b> represent waste materials/by-products, {{generated in}} huge quantities worldwide, which remain inadequately valorized. In this study, unmodified and maleated Kraft <b>lignins</b> {{were used as}} fillers in recycled polystyrene (RPS) to produce composites at different concentrations (0, 10, 20 and 30 %) via melt blending. Also, RPS composites with 20 % of maleated Kraft <b>lignins</b> were prepared by applying a previous surface treatment to the maleated Kraft <b>lignins</b> with RPS in solution. A complete mechanical, thermal and morphological characterization {{was performed on the}} RPS based composites containing Kraft <b>lignins.</b> The morphological study revealed better compatibility with RPS for unmodified Kraft <b>lignins</b> than maleated Kraft <b>lignins</b> except for the composite where maleated <b>lignins</b> surface treatment was applied. In this case, the RPS was well incorporated in the porous structure of maleated Kraft <b>lignins.</b> The results also showed that addition of unmodified Kraft <b>lignins</b> led to better mechanical and thermal properties of the composites than when maleated Kraft <b>lignins</b> were added. For the composite formulated with 20 % maleated Kraft <b>lignins</b> with a previous surface treatment, the properties were improved to become comparable to those of composites with unmodified Kraf...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{significant}} need to characterize and classify <b>lignins</b> and sulfonated <b>lignins.</b> <b>Lignins</b> have so far received {{a good deal of}} attention, whereas this is not true for sulfonated <b>lignins.</b> There is a clear demand for a better understanding of sulfonated <b>lignins</b> on a chemical as well as physical level. Many of the analytical methods have been developed with different goals in mind, for example, detection of sulfonated <b>lignins</b> in pulp-mill effluents, elucidation of structural changes in lignosulfonates during a pulping process, or identification of properties that may affect a formulation when sulfonated <b>lignins</b> are used as a dispersant. When sulfonated <b>lignins</b> are used in industrial applications, analytical data obtained using different techniques may be necessary to enable prediction of their behavior in the target application.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is the {{characterization}} of <b>lignins</b> and pulps obtained from Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus globulus woods by organosolv pulping using formic acidi acetone mixture as cooking agent. The samples were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) and chemical techniques. The <b>lignins</b> were precipitated by water from the black liquors of the wood pulping with formic acid/acetone (7 : 3 v/v), at temperatures of 154 degrees C and 165 degrees C for eucalyptus and pine, respectively. The FTIR spectra of the pulps indicated an effective delignification which was corroborated by the kappa numbers. The IR spectra of the <b>lignins</b> showed that they are highly condensed, with condensation indeces higher in pine <b>lignins</b> than in those extracted from eucalyptus, which increased as the pulping temperature was increased. The strong absorbance at 1720 cm(- 1) in the spectra of the <b>lignins</b> indicated the presence of saponifiable ester groups, possibly formate. High polydispersity of the samples of <b>lignins</b> was observed, which was lower in the eucalyptus than in the pine <b>lignins.</b> The molecular masses of the formic acid-acetone <b>lignins</b> were relatively higher than those found for other organosolv <b>lignins...</b>|$|R
5|$|Vascular land plants make <b>lignin,</b> a polymer used to {{strengthen}} the secondary cell walls of xylem tracheids and vessels {{to keep them from}} collapsing when a plant sucks water through them under water stress. <b>Lignin</b> is also used in other cell types like sclerenchyma fibres that provide structural support for a plant and is a major constituent of wood. Sporopollenin is a chemically resistant polymer found in the outer cell walls of spores and pollen of land plants responsible for the survival of early land plant spores and the pollen of seed plants in the fossil record. It is widely regarded as a marker for the start of land plant evolution during the Ordovician period.|$|E
5|$|Amylostereum is {{the single}} genus in the fungal family Amylostereaceae. The genus {{currently}} comprises four saprotrophic and parasitic species, which live off living or dead wood. The Amylostereaceae cause white rot in the wood by disintegrating the tissue component <b>lignin.</b> They produce crust-like, partially wavy fruit bodies {{on the surface of}} infested trees, which are similar to those produced by Stereum species.|$|E
5|$|During this process, fungal spores {{germinate}} in the boreholes, {{a reaction}} {{caused by the}} dryness of the tree, creating an appropriate environment and an entry for air.

40|$|The {{imminent}} {{industrial production}} of cellulosic ethanol from annual plants will generate {{massive amounts of}} herbaceous <b>lignins</b> {{that will have to}} be valorized. However, the chemical and physical properties of herbaceous <b>lignins</b> are much less known than those of wood <b>lignins.</b> In the present study, organosolv <b>lignins</b> were extracted from wheat, triticale, corn, 02 ax, and hemp residues using microwave irradiation under similar conditions. The extracted <b>lignins</b> were extensively analyzed by FT-IR, 39 P NMR, gel permeation chromatography, thermogravimetric analysis, and elemental and carbohydrate analysis to determine their applicability in polymers. All <b>lignins</b> were of high purity with low sugar, sulfur, and ash content. Corn, hemp, and 02 ax <b>lignins</b> were found to contain high concentrations of non-methoxylated phenolic groups, syringyl phenolic groups, and aliphatic OH groups, respectively, making them promising candidates for production of phenolic resins, stabilization of polyole 01 ns, and polyurethane synthesis, respectively. Triticale or wheat <b>lignins</b> were less speci 01 c, with a balanced content of OH groups, which makes them applicable to polyester synthesis. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
30|$|<b>Lignins,</b> {{which are}} complex phenylpropanoid {{polymers}} typically accounting for 15 – 30 % of lignocellulosic biomass, display considerable structural heterogeneity. In general, <b>lignins</b> in gymnosperms (softwoods) are composed mainly of guaiacyl (G) aromatic units derived via polymerization of coniferyl alcohol, whereas <b>lignins</b> in angiosperms, i.e., in both eudicots (e.g., hardwoods) and monocots including grasses, incorporate G and syringyl (S) aromatic units from sinapyl alcohol; both gymnosperm and angiosperm <b>lignins</b> also contain {{a small amount}} of p-hydroxyphenyl (H) units from p-coumaryl alcohol [7]. Unlike eudicot <b>lignins,</b> grass <b>lignins</b> also contain γ-p-coumaroylated G and S units incorporated via polymerization of γ-p-coumaroylated coniferyl and sinapyl alcohol conjugates [8], as well as flavone tricin units derived via co-polymerization of tricin with monolignols [9]. In addition, abundant ferulates cross-link <b>lignins</b> and hemicelluloses (arabinoxylans) in grass cell walls [8], further making grass cell walls unique and more complicated than gymnosperm and eudicot cell walls.|$|R

5|$|<b>Lignin</b> is {{a complex}} {{polymeric}} chemical compound that is a major constituent of wood. Resistant to biological decomposition, its presence in paper makes it weaker and more liable to discolor when exposed to light. The species C.bulleri contains three lignin-degrading enzymes: <b>lignin</b> peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, and laccase. These enzymes have potential applications {{not only in the}} pulp and paper industry, but also to increase the digestibility and protein content of forage for cattle. Because laccases can break down phenolic compounds they may be used to detoxify some environmental pollutants, such as dyes used in the textile industry. C.bulleri laccase has also been genetically engineered to be produced by Escherichia coli, making it the first fungal laccase to be produced in a bacterial host. C.pallidus can biodegrade the explosive compound RDX (hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine), suggesting it might be used to decontaminate munitions-contaminated soils.|$|E
5|$|Mycena galopus is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and plays}} an important role in forest ecosystems as a decomposer of leaf litter. It has been estimated in the UK to account for a large portion of the decomposition of the autumn leaf litter in British woodlands. It is able to break down the <b>lignin</b> and cellulose components of leaf litter. Grown in axenic culture in the laboratory, the fungus mycelium has been shown to degrade (in addition to <b>lignin</b> and cellulose) hemicelluloses, protein, soluble carbohydrates, and purified xylan and pectin using enzymes such as polyphenol oxidases, cellulases, and catalase. It is particularly adept at breaking down <b>lignin,</b> which is the second most abundant renewable organic compound in the biosphere, after cellulose. Research also suggests that the fungus weathers soil minerals, making them more available to mycorrhizal plants. Phosphorus, an important macronutrient influencing plant growth, typically occurs in primary minerals like apatite, or other organic complexes, and its low solubility often results in low phosphorus availability in soil. The biological activity of M.galopus mycelium can increase the availability of phosphorus and other nutrients, both as a result of soil acidification due to cation uptake and via the release of weathering agents such low molecular mass organic acids. Studies have shown that the fungus is sensitive to low concentrations of sulphite (SO32−), a byproduct of sulphur dioxide pollution, suggesting that this pollution can be toxic to the growth of the fungus (and the subsequent decomposition of leaf litter) at environmentally relevant concentrations.|$|E

40|$|We have {{investigated}} {{the impact of the}} brown-midrib bm 5 mutation on <b>lignins</b> and on p-coumaric acid and ferulic acid ester-linked to maize (Zea mays L.) cell walls. Lignified stalks or plant aerial parts (without ears) collected at grain maturity were studied in three genetic backgrounds. Relative to the control, bm 5 mutants displayed lower levels of <b>lignins</b> and of p-coumarate esters but increased levels of ferulate esters. Thioacidolysis revealed that bm 5 <b>lignins</b> display an increased frequency of free-phenolic guaiacyl units. More importantly, thioacidolysis provided unusual amounts of 1, 2, 2 -trithioethyl ethylguaiacol, a marker compound diagnostic for the incorporation of free ferulic acid into <b>lignins</b> by bis 8 -O- 4 cross-coupling. As the resulting acetal bonding pattern is a chemically labile branch point introduced in maize <b>lignins</b> by the bm 5 mutation, this alteration is prone to facilitate the delignification pretreatments used in the cellulose-to-ethanol process...|$|R
