It compares the phases of two input signals and produces an error signal that {{is proportional to the}} difference between their phases. The error signal is then <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filtered</b> and used to drive a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) which creates an output frequency. The output frequency is fed through a frequency divider back to the input of the system, producing a negative feedback loop. If the output frequency drifts, the phase error signal will increase, driving the frequency in the opposite direction so as to reduce the error. Thus the output is locked to the frequency at the other input. This other input is called the reference and is usually derived from a crystal oscillator, which is very stable in frequency.

30|$|The <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filter</b> gives a {{blurring}} {{effect to}} an image as it filters out high frequency components from the image. The watermark is robust against <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filtering</b> {{as it is}} not embedded into high frequencies. The error correcting codes perform equally well for the <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filter</b> attack, the bit error rate is 0 (Figure 10 b) except for some cases of large filter dimensions (9 × 9) and no code protection. This is because the <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filter</b> starts filtering frequencies where the watermark is embedded but the error correcting codes provide enough robustness so that this error remains negligible. This robustness against <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filter</b> is a generic feature of transform domain watermarking schemes as usually transform domain watermarking schemes do not insert the mark in high frequencies.|$|R

30|$|The edge-sharpening {{is also an}} {{important}} topic in image processing, which enhances the visual quality of images [6 – 9]. One of the classical edge enhancement methods is to use the “unsharpening filter”, where an image is <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filtered</b> and subtracted from the original, which leaves the high band signal that contains the edges. The high band signal is then amplified and added to the <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filtered</b> image, which is the edge-sharpened result. When the Gaussian filter is used for the low pass filtering, its subtraction from the original is the Laplacian of Gaussian, and thus the subband images so formed are called the Laplacian Pyramids [6]. In this process, since the noise in the high band can also be amplified, it is necessary to denoise all the subband images in the Laplacian pyramid.|$|E

With a few exceptions [29, 30], analysis in the time domain usually starts with pre-processing which generally comprises decimation followed by a <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filter</b> with a cut-off frequency of around 200 Hz. The decimation decreases the computational load on the analysis module. <b>Low</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filtering</b> is used as pre-processing step as heart beat has characteristics of low frequency signal.

In this experiment we evaluated the hearing thresholds of three different signals (wide-band, <b>low</b> <b>pass</b> <b>filtered,</b> and high pass filtered noises) in presence of a high level low frequency masker (90 dB SPL, 220 Hz), and we decreased the transmission of both masker and signal by changing the middle ear stiffness in 42 normal subjects {{to determine whether or not}} their thresholds will change by the same amounts which leads to linear function or their thresholds will change by different amounts which will be related to nonlinear function of masking at high levels.

In conclusion, as the level of the tone was effectively decreased by changing the impedance, frequency tuning improves and the noise was less suppressed by the tone, making it easier to detect.
