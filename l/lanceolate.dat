5|$|The firm {{bark and}} <b>lanceolate</b> leaves of P.lanceolata {{distinguish}} it from P.levis, with which it can be confused; the latter species has flaky bark and asymmetrical leaves.|$|E
5|$|The basidia (spore-bearing cells) of T.tabacinus are {{club-shaped}} {{and measure}} 23.5–37.0 by 8.5–13.0μm. The pleurocystidia (cystidia {{found on the}} inner surface of the tubes) are 45.0–60.0 by 6.5–12.5μm, <b>lanceolate</b> (lance-shaped) to narrowly fusoid-ventricose (enlarged {{in the middle and}} somewhat spindle-shaped). Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the outer edges of the tubes) are absent. The caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) form the reticulations on the stem; they are usually club-shaped and measure 21.0–40.5 by 6.5–10.5μm.|$|E
5|$|Surrounding {{the floral}} tube and corona and reflexed (bent back) {{from the rest}} of the {{perianth}} are the six spreading tepals or floral leaves, in two whorls which may be distally ascending, reflexed (folded back), or <b>lanceolate.</b> Like many monocotyledons, the perianth is homochlamydeous, that is undifferentiated into separate calyx (sepals) and corolla (petals), but rather has six tepals. The three outer tepal segments may be considered sepals, and the three inner segments petals. The transition point between the floral tube and the corona is marked by the insertion of the free tepals on the fused perianth.|$|E

5|$|The oldest {{artifacts}} {{found in}} Iowa are Clovis points, large <b>lanceolate</b> points found occasionally {{in all parts}} of the state except for the Des Moines Lobe. Possible sources of game were giant Pleistocene megafauna, including mammoth, mastodon, and giant forms of bison, all of which are now extinct. While widespread, only two Clovis sites have been excavated in Iowa. The Rummells-Maske site is a Clovis site in Cedar County; unfortunately, this site was damaged by plowing, although 20 points and point fragments were recovered. The Carlisle Clovis Cache Site in Warren County contained 38 unfinished stone tools that appear to date to the Clovis period, but these results have not yet been published.|$|E
5|$|Golondrina points (formerly Plainview Golondrina) are <b>lanceolate</b> spear or dart {{projectile}} points, {{of medium}} size, dated to the transitional Paleo-Indian Period, between 9000–7000 BP. Golondrina points were attached on split-stem hafts {{and may have}} served to bring down medium-sized animals such as deer, as well as functioning as butchering knives. Distribution is widespread throughout most of Texas, and points have also been discovered in Arkansas and Mexico. The concentration of Golondrina specimens is highest across the South Texas Plains, where the point is the most prevalent of Paleo-Indian types and defines a distinctive cultural pattern for the region. The Golondrina point is so named for its flared basal corners ("ears"), which resemble a swallow's (golondrina in Spanish) split tail. Classification of Golondrina can be difficult because of its similarity to other types, particularly the Plainview point, to which it was originally thought to be related.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} layers at Mummy Cave {{yielded a}} few prismatic stone blades dating to about 7300BC. Several layers contained no artifacts and were defined by soot layers. By layer6 the first parallel-oblique points appeared. By Layer8, roughly corresponding to 6500BC, the cultural evidence became continuous. Layers8, 9, 10 and 12 produced <b>lanceolate</b> or leaf-shaped projectile points {{which have been}} interpreted as corresponding to Angostura-style points. This implies that the inhabitants of Mummy Cave during this era were big-game hunters from the Great Plains who adapted to the mountain environment. In layer16, radiocarbon dated to 5630BC, {{a new type of}} point appeared. These Blackwater side-notched points implied the arrival of a group from eastern Nebraska or western Iowa, replacing the previous group which may have moved to the north. The presence of such points suggests a connection with the Simonsen Site in northeastern Iowa, which has been dated to the Early Archaic period. This transition coincided with the climatic shift to the Altithermal. Side-notched points recovered from layers21, 24 and 28 imply a return of the previous inhabitants; the easterners had moved on to the central Columbian Plateau.|$|E

50|$|A {{different}} type of urticating hair was found during the study of Kankuamo marquezi. The spider was covered with rust-colored bristles, including an unusual oval patch of sharp-tipped barbed hairs. Some <b>lanceolated</b> barbs are arranged with their tips towards the penetration tip of the hair, opposite to the main barbs. These unique urticating hairs were put in {{a new type of}} urticating hair, type VII. They were considered to have evolved to defend the spider against direct contact.|$|R

Florets have <b>lanceolated</b> lemma which is 4 - 5 mm long and 1.5 - 2 mm wide. It is also chartaceous and way thinner above and where margins are.|$|R
25|$|It has thin scaly brown bark, {{covering}} {{a thin layer}} of off-white sap wood with a darker heartwood that varies in color from brown to a magenta/purplish hue.

25|$|Birdwings are {{typified by}} large size (up {{to a maximum}} body length of 7.6cm or 3inches and a {{wingspan}} of 28cm or 11inches in O. alexandrae), showy colouration (in contrasting shades of green, yellow, black, white, and sometimes blue or orange), and slender, <b>lanceolate</b> forewings. With few exceptions (i.e., the New Guinean O. meridionalis and O. paradisea), the hindwings lack tails. Sexual dimorphism is strong in Ornithoptera species only, where males are black combined with bright iridescent green, blue, orange, or yellow while the larger and less colourful females are overall black or dark brownish with white, pale brown, or yellow markings.|$|E
50|$|The {{species is}} bisexual, cespitose, {{perennial}} and is rhizomatous. The culms are 90 cm long and about 0.6 mm thick. They are also erect, decumbent, and scabrous {{at the same}} time.
