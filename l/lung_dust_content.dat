40|$|The {{relation}} between the profusion and predominant type of small rounded opacities on chest radiographs taken within four years of death and the postmortem counts of dust lesions in four classes (macules, "pinhead" fibrotic nodules, nodules 1 - 3 mm, and nodules greater than 3 - 9 mm in diameter) has been examined for 71 coalworkers without progressive massive fibrosis. The radiographs were categorised by four readers independently, according to the ILO classification. For subjects considered by each reader to present predominantly p type opacities, increasing opacity profusion was exclusively and significantly associated {{with an increase in}} the number of pinhead fibrotic nodules. Numbers of nodules measuring 1 - 3 mm and greater than 3 - 9 mm in diameter both showed significant linear associations with opacity profusion category in subjects presenting predominantly q opacities, the closer association being observed with the smaller lesions. These observations held true for all readers. Opacities of type r were rarely considered to be the predominant type. For the reader who recorded the maximum number of such cases, opacity profusion was not significantly related to the numbers of dust lesions in any of the lesion classes. Nevertheless, the closest association was observed with nodules measuring greater than 3 - 9 mm in diameter. An overall significant linear association between total <b>lung</b> <b>dust</b> <b>content</b> and opacity profusion was found to be due mainly to subjects presenting predominantly p type opacities and to a lesser extent to those with predominantly q opacities...|$|E

The variation characteristics of reflectance spectra of E. japonicus and foliar <b>dust</b> <b>content</b> were noted, and the differences of leaf reflectance and first derivative spectrum between leaves with and without dust were analyzed. The correlation between foliar <b>dust</b> <b>content</b> and leaf spectral reflectance was established. The results suggest that foliar dust increased the reflectance in specific ranges of the visible light spectrum, decreased the reflectance at near infrared regions, and had no change in red edge position, blue edge slope, yellow and blue edge area.

40|$|Objectives This {{study has}} {{researched}} {{the significance of}} histologically raised findings and <b>lung</b> <b>dust</b> analyses {{in the context of}} claiming the recognition of and thus compensation for an asbestos-associated occupational disease. Material and Methods For this approach, all findings from the German Mesothelioma Register in 2015 that included <b>lung</b> <b>dust</b> analyses were evaluated and were compared with information on asbestos fiber exposure at work based on fiber years, and with the results of radiological findings. Results For 68 insured persons, recognition of an asbestos-induced lung disease according to Section 4104 of the German Ordinance on Occupational Diseases (Berufskrankheitenverordnung – BKV) could be recommended {{solely on the basis of}} the histological examinations of lung tissues and complementary <b>lung</b> <b>dust</b> analyses. Neither did the calculation of the cumulative asbestos dust exposure at work yield 25 fiber years, nor could bridge findings (e. g., plaques) be identified. In addition, the autopsies of 12 patients revealed plaques that had not been diagnosed during radiological examinations. These results show that – irrespective of the prescribed working techniques and radiological diagnosis – pathological/anatomical and histological diagnostics are often the only way for the insureds to demonstrate the causal connection between asbestos and their disease. Even after long intervals of up to 40 years post last exposure, the asbestos fibers would still be easily detectable in the lung tissues evaluated. Conclusions Whenever suitable tissue is available, it should be examined for mild asbestosis with the aid of a <b>lung</b> <b>dust</b> analysis. Otherwise there is a risk that an occupational disease is wrongfully rejected. In the context of health insurance, the <b>lung</b> <b>dust</b> analysis and the resulting proof of the presence of asbestosis often constitute one option of providing evidence of an occupational disease.

Dust deposition provides rock-derived nutrients such as phosphorus (P) to terrestrial ecosystems. Over pedogenic timescales, as bedrock sources of P are depleted, dust sources of P may support productivity in certain ecosystems, but controls on the spatial variability of dust in montane forested systems are largely unknown. Here, we use neodymium (Nd) isotope ratios in 31 ridgetop surface soils to evaluate the spatial variability of dust contributions to soil across ~ 100 km² in the Luquillo Mountains, Puerto Rico. Dust from the Sahara–Sahel region of Africa carries a distinct isotopic signature of − 12 ε[Subscript Nd]. Local bedrock, in contrast, has a ε[Subscript Nd] value of ~+ 7. End-member mixing calculations based on εNd reveal a wide range in dust influence on surface soils, with between 0 % and 92 % of the top 20 cm of ridgetop soil Nd derived from African dust. Using ε[Subscript Nd] paired with both dust and soil Nd content, the current soil <b>dust</b> <b>content</b> was calculated, ranging from 0 to 8 %. There were no correlations between current <b>dust</b> <b>content</b> of soil and ¹⁰Be-based denudation rate, elevation, rainfall, longitude, or forest type. Current soil <b>dust</b> <b>content</b> in the Luquillo Mountains is significantly higher in soils developed on volcaniclastic sandstone, breccia and mudstone than in soils developed on quartz diorite bedrock, which we attribute to greater retention capacity in the volcaniclastic soils. Current soil <b>dust</b> <b>content</b> also increases with increasing ridge-width, implying that small-scale topographic effects and other factors such as wind speed and turbulence influence local dust deposition rates. Higher current <b>dust</b> <b>content</b> of soil is also positively correlated with biologically cycled fractions of soil P on quartz diorite bedrock (r² = 0. 24 and p = 0. 002 for sum of extractable NaHCO₃-P + NaOH-P), suggesting that atmospheric dust inputs contribute to the fertility of Luquillo Mountain ecosystems on the relatively P-poor quartz diorite bedrock...|$|R

40|$|During {{the early}} stages of galaxy evolution, the {{metallicity}} is generally low and nearby metal-poor star-forming galaxies may provide templates for primordial star formation. In particular, the <b>dust</b> <b>content</b> of such objects is of great importance since early molecular formation can take place on grains. To gain insight into primeval galaxies at high redshift, we examine the <b>dust</b> <b>content</b> of the nearby extremely low-metallicity galaxy SBS 0335 - 052 which hosts a very young starburst (< 10 Myr). In young galaxies, the dust formation rate in Type II supernovae governs the amount of dust, and by incorporating recent results on dust production in Type II supernovae we model the evolution of <b>dust</b> <b>content.</b> If the star-forming region is compact (< 100 pc), as suggested by observations of SBS 0335 - 052, our models consistently explain the quantity of dust, far-infrared luminosity, and dust temperature in this low-metallicity object.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the spectroscopic properties of a sample of 19 optically bright, low luminosity Flat Radio Spectrum (LL FRS) sources.

We have computed the nuclear stellar populations contributing to the spectra of our objects. The stellar population synthesis has been performed by using a very reliable mathematical method, which yields a Global Principal Geometrical solution. Our results show that, {{for most of the}} objects in the sample, the populations are composed of old stars of solar metallicity, or lower; the populations are mainly composed of late-type stars, i. e. G, K and M spectral types, the young component coming thus from supergiant stars; the <b>dust</b> <b>content</b> is weak. Both the stellar populations and the <b>dust</b> <b>content</b> are in agreement with what is usually observed in "normal" elliptical galaxies. Similar stellar content has equally been found in the nuclear regions of galaxies hosting a Low Ionization Nuclear Emission Line Region, or LINER. The present work is important in illustrating the different applications of stellar population synthesis in the study of low luminosity radio sources. In fact, the synthesis allows us not only to obtain valuable information about the stellar populations and <b>dust</b> <b>content</b> of the host galaxies, therefore providing material for further studies on the connection between host galaxy and active nucleus, but also to reveal the so-far unstudied optical emission-line features present in the spectrum of our objects.
