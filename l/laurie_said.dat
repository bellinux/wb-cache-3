500|$|During {{the filming}} of the episode, which took place before a studio {{audience}} at BBC Television Centre, Rowan Atkinson described sharing his character's dread of impending death and feeling a [...] "knot {{in the pit of}} my stomach", something that he had never experienced. Hugh <b>Laurie</b> <b>said</b> that filming was sad because [...] "even for comic effect, we were representing the deaths {{of hundreds of thousands of}} people". Regarding guest star Geoffrey Palmer, the producer John Lloyd said [...] " [...] probably could have given [...] more attention", calling him [...] "a wonderful actor" [...] who is [...] "really just delivering three or four plot lines [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Laurie later {{revealed}} that he initially thought the show's central character was Dr. James Wilson. He assumed that House was a supporting part, {{due to the nature}} of the character, until he received the full script of the pilot episode. Laurie, the son of medical doctor Ran <b>Laurie,</b> <b>said</b> he felt guilty for [...] "being paid more to become a fake version of [...] own father". From the start of season three, he was being paid $275,000 to $300,000 per episode, as much as three times what he had previously been making on the series. By the show's fifth season, Laurie was earning around $400,000 per episode, making him one of the highest-paid actors on network television.|$|E
500|$|Gay {{references}} {{have been}} made to {{the relationship between the two}} characters of the show. House has made a comment about the relationship ("I'm gay!...Oh that's not what you meant. It would explain a lot, though: no girlfriend, always with Wilson, the obsession with sneakers..."). [...] Barbara Barnett said that [...] "House is the needy one in the relationship, and Wilson the doormat" [...] Verne Gay of Newsday described House's love for Wilson as [...] "touching and genuine". However, Robert Sean Leonard compared the relationship between the two to that of Cesar Millan and his Pit Bull, while Hugh <b>Laurie</b> <b>said</b> that it's [...] "not just buddydom". The two characters appeared on the October 13, 2008, cover of TV Guide.|$|E
6000|$|... "To hear is to obey, but March is fairer far than May," [...] {{said little}} Parker, making a frantic {{effort to be}} both witty and tender, and getting {{promptly}} quenched by <b>Laurie,</b> who <b>said...</b>|$|R
5000|$|After a {{discussion}} of McQueen's work, the literary critic <b>Laurie</b> Clancy <b>said,</b> [...] "Although {{the best of his}} short stories are very fine, McQueen's limitations tend to be exposed more in the novels, with their formulaic characterizations." ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{a minute}} a hand came {{down over the}} page, {{so that she could}} not draw, and <b>Laurie's</b> voice <b>said,</b> with a droll {{imitation}} of a penitent child, [...] "I will be good, oh, I will be good!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Later in the evening, {{when his}} mind {{had been set}} at rest about the bootjack, <b>Laurie</b> <b>said</b> {{suddenly}} to his wife, [...] "Mrs. Laurence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, you didn't, {{you knew}} {{perfectly}} well I never cared for anyone but Jo," [...] <b>Laurie</b> <b>said</b> that in his old, impetuous tone, and turned his face away as he spoke.|$|E
6000|$|When <b>Laurie</b> <b>said</b> good-by, {{he whispered}} significantly, [...] "It won't do {{a bit of}} good, Jo. My eye is on you, so mind what you do, or I'll come and bring you home." ...|$|E
50|$|Since February 2009 TVS {{simultaneously}} streamed {{its service}} via the internet. At the time Chief Executive, <b>Laurie</b> Patton, <b>said</b> {{the decision to}} transmit live via the web {{was part of the}} station’s long term strategy to be available across all distribution platforms.|$|R
50|$|On Twitter, the {{political}} writer <b>Laurie</b> Penny <b>said</b> {{that she did}} not {{have a problem with the}} vandalism of the war memorial. Hopkins reacted to this negatively, suggesting that Penny be sent to join Islamic State. Penny's comments and Hopkins's reactions both received national media coverage.|$|R
6000|$|... "Play something, Amy. Let them {{hear how}} much you have improved," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Laurie,</b> with pardonable pride in his {{promising}} pupil.|$|R
60|$|He did {{not speak}} to her again till suppertime, {{when he saw her}} {{drinking}} champagne with Ned and his friend Fisher, who were behaving 'like a pair of fools', as <b>Laurie</b> <b>said</b> to himself, for he felt a brotherly sort of right to watch over the Marches and fight their battles whenever a defender was needed.|$|E
60|$|The pillow was gone, {{but there}} was a barricade, nevertheless, a natural one, raised by time, absence, and change of heart. Both felt it, and for a minute looked at one another as if that {{invisible}} barrier cast a little shadow over them. It was gone directly however, for <b>Laurie</b> <b>said,</b> with a vain attempt at dignity...|$|E
60|$|The {{song was}} {{considered}} a great success, and the singer retired covered with laurels. But a few minutes afterward, he forgot his manners entirely, and stared at Amy putting on her bonnet, for she had been introduced simply as 'my sister', {{and no one had}} called her by her new name since he came. He forgot himself still further when <b>Laurie</b> <b>said,</b> in his most gracious manner, at parting...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you like}} them so much, come down and see ours. Grandfather is out, so you needn't be afraid," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Laurie,</b> getting up.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good girl! Call Meg, {{and tell}} her you'll give in," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Laurie,</b> with an {{approving}} pat, which annoyed Amy more than the 'giving in'.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pin it round your neck, {{and then}} it will be useful," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Laurie,</b> looking down at the little blue boots, which he evidently {{approved}} of.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've got to {{stay for}} this confounded supper, but I shall be home early tomorrow. You'll come and meet me as usual, girls?" [...] <b>Laurie</b> <b>said,</b> as he put the sisters into the {{carriage}} after the joys of the day were over. He said 'girls', but he meant Jo, for {{she was the only}} one who kept up the old custom. She had not the heart to refuse her splendid, successful boy anything, and answered warmly...|$|E
60|$|For a year Jo and her Professor {{worked and}} waited, hoped and loved, met occasionally, and wrote such voluminous letters {{that the rise}} in the price of paper was {{accounted}} for, <b>Laurie</b> <b>said.</b> The second year began rather soberly, for their prospects did not brighten, and Aunt March died suddenly. But when their first sorrow was over--for they loved the old lady in spite of her sharp tongue--they found they had cause for rejoicing, for she had left Plumfield to Jo, which made all sorts of joyful things possible.|$|E
6000|$|If the Laurences {{had been}} what Jo called 'prim and poky', {{she would not}} have got on at all, for such people always made her shy and awkward. But finding them free and easy, she was so herself, and made a good impression. When they rose she {{proposed}} to go, but <b>Laurie</b> <b>said</b> he had something more to show her, and took her away to the conservatory, which had been lighted for her benefit. It seemed quite fairylike to Jo, as she went up and down the walks, enjoying the blooming walls on either side, the soft light, the damp sweet air, and the wonderful vines and trees that hung about her, while her new friend cut the finest flowers till his hands were full. Then he tied them up, saying, with the happy look Jo liked to see, [...] "Please give these to your mother, and tell her I like the medicine she sent me very much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{guess the}} princess {{gave him a}} posy, and opened the gate after a while," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Laurie,</b> smiling to himself, as he threw acorns at his tutor.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{made such}} {{quantities}} {{it would be}} hard to choose which I'd have," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Laurie,</b> lying flat and throwing cones at the squirrel who had betrayed him.|$|R
5000|$|As a producer, Leonard {{has also}} worked on albums for artists Donna Lewis (In the Pink), Ari Hest (The Fire Plays), Donnie Mortimer (Ten Eventful Years), the Czech band Čechomor (Mistečko), and Pamela Sue Mann. Of his {{playing on the}} latter's L'Oeuf, <b>Laurie</b> Anderson <b>said</b> [...] "I've always {{been a fan of}} Gerry Leonard's lush and groovy parts so that makes the {{listening}} experience even deeper." ...|$|R
6000|$|Nat {{was very}} fond of Mrs. Bhaer, but found {{something}} even more attractive in the good professor, who took fatherly care of the shy feeble boy, who had barely escaped with his life from the rough sea on which his little boat had been tossing rudderless for twelve years. Some good angel must have been watching over him, for, though his body had suffered, his soul seemed to have taken little harm, and came ashore as innocent as a shipwrecked baby. Perhaps his love of music kept it sweet {{in spite of the}} discord all about him; Mr. <b>Laurie</b> <b>said</b> so, and he ought to know. However that might be, Father Bhaer took pleasure in fostering poor Nat's virtues, and in curing his faults, finding his new pupil as docile and affectionate as a girl. He often called Nat his [...] "daughter" [...] when speaking of him to Mrs. Jo, and she used to laugh at his fancy, for Madame liked manly boys, and thought Nat amiable but weak, though you never would have guessed it, for she petted him as she did Daisy, and he thought her a very delightful woman.|$|E
60|$|It was {{not nearly}} so well done, {{but there was a}} life and spirit in it which atoned for many faults, and it {{recalled}} the past so vividly that a sudden change swept over the young man's face as he looked. Only a rough sketch of Laurie taming a horse. Hat and coat were off, and every line of the active figure, resolute face, and commanding attitude was full of energy and meaning. The handsome brute, just subdued, stood arching his neck under the tightly drawn rein, with one foot impatiently pawing the ground, and ears pricked up as if listening for the voice that had mastered him. In the ruffled mane, the rider's breezy hair and erect attitude, there was a suggestion of suddenly arrested motion, of strength, courage, and youthful buoyancy that contrasted sharply with the supine grace of the 'Dolce far Niente' sketch. <b>Laurie</b> <b>said</b> nothing but as his eye went from one to the other, Amy saw him flush up and fold his lips together as if he read and accepted the little lesson she had given him. That satisfied her, and without waiting for him to speak, she said, in her sprightly way...|$|E
6000|$|Then {{appeared}} the grand {{triumph of the}} piece. First, a rope was seen to flap on the floor, to tighten with a twitch as Emil's voice was heard to say, [...] "Heave, ahoy!" [...] and Silas's gruff one to reply, [...] "Stiddy, now, stiddy!" [...] A shout of laughter followed, for four large gray rats appeared, rather shaky as to their legs, and queer as to their tails, but quite fine about the head, where black beads shone in the most lifelike manner. They drew, or were intended to appear as if they did, a magnificent coach made of half the mammoth pumpkin, mounted on the wheels of Teddy's wagon, painted yellow to match the gay carriage. Perched on a seat in front sat a jolly little coachman in a white cotton-wool wig, cocked hat, scarlet breeches, and laced coat, who cracked a long whip and jerked the red reins so energetically, that the gray steeds reared finely. It was Teddy, and he beamed upon the company so affably that {{they gave him a}} round all to himself; and Uncle <b>Laurie</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "If I could find as sober a coachman as that one, I would engage him on the spot." [...] The coach stopped, the godmother lifted in the Princess, and she was trundled away in state, kissing her hand to the public, with her glass shoes sticking up in front, and her pink train sweeping the ground behind, for, elegant as the coach was, I regret to say that her Highness was rather a tight fit.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a fine old place, {{and will}} bring a {{handsome}} sum, for of course you intend to sell it," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Laurie,</b> as they were all talking the matter over some weeks later.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here comes Ned Moffat. What does he want?" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Laurie,</b> {{knitting}} {{his black}} brows {{as if he}} did not regard his young host in the light of a pleasant addition to the party.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm a {{great deal}} better for it, and ever so much obliged. I'm only afraid you are very tired of talking to me. It was so pleasant, I couldn't bear to stop," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Laurie</b> gratefully.|$|R
5000|$|CTEG {{spokesperson}} Henri <b>Laurie</b> <b>said</b> {{the conference}} was significant in that people from backgrounds that were potentially divisive had shown a willingness to work together. [...] "The amount of goodwill was remarkable and the delegates showed an enormous degree of solidarity on the environmental issue." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Laurie</b> <b>said</b> nearly 30 {{minutes of}} footage was deleted {{because it did}} not reflect {{intended}} themes of principles and leadership. Based on lack of enthusiasm in test screenings to the final scene where Laine addresses the House Judiciary Committee, and with Spielberg's advice, Lurie added music intended to be inspirational, which did receive a better response from test audiences.|$|E
50|$|Of Cornish descent, he {{was known}} as 'the Gentleman Boxer'. On the way home from the Olympics, a fellow {{passenger}} in the liner persistently asked Laurie to go a few rounds with him in the gym, eventually Laurie agreed and after two rounds, woke {{up to the fact that}} the fellow passenger was trying to knock him out, so that he could claim an Olympic Gold scalp. <b>Laurie</b> <b>said</b> 'enough Chum' and that was the end of a dream.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear soul! {{you look}} as if 'only loving' had been rather hard work sometimes," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Laurie,</b> {{stroking}} her thin cheek {{with a look of}} more tender admiration than he had ever given her as a girl.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll send my bill, by-and-by, {{and tonight}} I'll give you {{something}} that will warm the cockles of your heart better than quarts of wine," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Laurie,</b> beaming {{at her with a}} face of suppressed satisfaction at something.|$|R
6000|$|... "Na, na, <b>Laurie,</b> lad," [...] <b>said</b> Richie, [...] "I ken better what belangs to sifflications than I did yon day; and ye {{will say}} that yoursell, if ye will but get that bit note to the king's hand." ...|$|R
