5|$|Bats {{are natural}} {{reservoirs}} {{for a large}} number of zoonotic pathogens, including rabies, histoplasmosis both directly and in guano, Nipah Hendra viruses, and possibly ebola virus. Their high mobility, broad distribution, long <b>life</b> <b>spans,</b> substantial sympatry, and social behaviour make bats favourable hosts and vectors of disease. Compared to rodents, bats carry more zoonotic viruses per species, and each virus is shared with more species. They seem to be highly resistant to many of the pathogens they carry, suggesting a degree of adaptation to bats' immune systems. Furthermore, their interactions with livestock and pets, including predation by vampire bats, accidental encounters, and the scavenging of bat carcasses, compound the risk of zoonotic transmission.|$|E

Males of most species survive a few matings, limited mainly by their short <b>life</b> <b>spans.</b> Females weave silk egg-cases, each of which may contain hundreds of eggs. Females of many species care for their young, for example by carrying them around or by sharing food with them. A minority of species are social, building communal webs that may house anywhere from a few to 50,000 individuals. Social behavior ranges from precarious toleration, as in the widow spiders, to co-operative hunting and food-sharing. Although most spiders live for at most two years, tarantulas and other mygalomorph spiders can live up to 25years in captivity.|$|E
5|$|This nuthatch's {{responses}} to predators {{may be linked}} to a reproductive strategy. A study compared the white-breasted nuthatch with the red-breasted nuthatch in terms of the willingness of males to feed incubating females on the nest when presented with models of predators. The models were of a sharp-shinned hawk, which hunts adult nuthatches, and a house wren, which destroys eggs. The white-breasted nuthatch is shorter-lived than the red-breasted nuthatch, but has more young, and was found to respond more strongly to the egg predator, whereas the red-breasted showed greater concern with the hawk.

Nuthatches and other small woodland birds share the same predators: accipiters, owls, squirrels and woodpeckers. An American study showed that nuthatch responses to predators {{may be linked to}} reproductive strategies. It measured the willingness of males of two species to feed incubating females on the nest when presented with models of a sharp-shinned hawk, which hunts adult nuthatches, or a house wren, which destroys eggs.

Multiple mechanisms affect longevity, {{many of which are}} conserved across species, but the genetic networks underlying each mechanism and cross-talk between networks are unknown. We report the results of a screen for mutations affecting Drosophila <b>life</b> <b>span.</b> One third of the 1, 332 homozygous P-element insertion lines assessed had quantitative effects on life span; mutations reducing <b>life</b> <b>span</b> were twice as common as mutations increasing <b>life</b> <b>span.</b> We confirmed 58 mutations with increased longevity, only one of which is in a gene previously associated with <b>life</b> <b>span.</b> The effects of the mutations increasing <b>life</b> <b>span</b> were highly sex-specific, with a trend towards opposite effects in males and females. Mutations in the same gene were associated with both increased and decreased <b>life</b> <b>span,</b> depending on the location and orientation of the P-element insertion, and genetic background. We observed substantial [...] and sex-specific [...] epistasis among a sample of ten mutations with increased <b>life</b> <b>span.</b> All mutations increasing <b>life</b> <b>span</b> had at least one deleterious pleiotropic effect on stress resistance or general health, with different patterns of pleiotropy for males and females.

Therefore longevity has a large mutational target size; genes affecting <b>life</b> <b>span</b> have variable allelic effects; alleles affecting <b>life</b> <b>span</b> exhibit antagonistic pleiotropy and form epistatic networks; and sex-specific mutational effects are ubiquitous.

We demonstrate numerically that the duration of evolved postreproductive <b>life</b> <b>span</b> is indeed expected to increase with variability in <b>life</b> <b>span</b> duration. An unprecedented assay of 11 strains of the collembola Folsomia candida shows the existence of (1) postreproductive <b>life</b> <b>span</b> in the absence of parental care; (2) genetic variability in mean postreproductive <b>life</b> <b>span</b> and postreproductive <b>life</b> <b>span</b> variability itself; (3) strong genetic correlation between latter traits.

5|$|Stars {{generate}} {{energy by}} the nuclear fusion of elements. Unlike the Sun, massive stars possess the mass needed to fuse elements {{that have an}} atomic mass greater than hydrogen and helium, albeit at increasingly higher temperatures and pressures, causing increasingly shorter stellar <b>life</b> <b>spans.</b> The degeneracy pressure of electrons and the energy generated by these fusion reactions are sufficient to counter {{the force of gravity}} and prevent the star from collapsing, maintaining stellar equilibrium. The star fuses increasingly higher mass elements, starting with hydrogen and then helium, progressing up through the periodic table until a core of iron and nickel is produced. Fusion of iron or nickel produces no net energy output, so no further fusion can take place, leaving the nickel-iron core inert. Due to the lack of energy output creating outward pressure, equilibrium is broken and the core is compressed by the overlying mass of the star.|$|E

However, the triple deletion of stress-resistance genes MSN 2 /MSN 4 and RIM 15, which causes a major decrease in chronological <b>life</b> <b>span,</b> extends replicative <b>life</b> <b>span.</b> Similarly, the overexpression of superoxide dismutases, which extends chronological survival, shortens the replicative <b>life</b> <b>span</b> and prevents budding in 30 – 40 % of virgin mother cells.

The role of superoxide dismutases and of other stress-resistance proteins in extending the chronological <b>life</b> <b>span</b> of yeast, worms, and flies indicates that the negative effect of Sod 2, Msn 2 /Msn 4 /Rim 15 on the replicative <b>life</b> <b>span</b> of S. cerevisiae is independent of aging...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSir 2 is a conserved deacetylase that modulates <b>life</b> <b>span</b> in yeast, worms, {{and flies}} and stress {{response}} in mammals.
