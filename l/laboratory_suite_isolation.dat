40|$|The authors {{evaluated}} vaporized {{hydrogen peroxide}} {{as an alternative}} to formaldehyde for space biodecontamination in a containment level 3 <b>laboratory</b> <b>suite.</b> The <b>laboratory</b> air pressure during the biodecontamination process was maintained at a slightly negative pressure. This was done as a preventive measure to ensure that hazardous vaporized hydrogen peroxide would not escape during the process. Parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, vaporized hydrogen peroxide concentration, and pressure within the <b>laboratory</b> <b>suite</b> were monitored during the biodecontamination. The success of the decontamination process was validated using spores of G. stearothermophilus, the most resistant microorganism to vaporized hydrogen peroxide (Kokubo et al., 1998; Meszaros, 2005; Rickloff & Orelski, 1989). This research demonstrates the usefulness of vaporized hydrogen peroxide as a space biodecontaminant...|$|R

50|$|In the 1990s, the US medical {{biological}} defense research effort (part of the U.S. Army’s Biological Defense Research Program BDRP) was concentrated at USAMRIID at Fort Detrick. The army maintained state-of-the-art containment {{laboratory facilities}} there, {{with more than}} 10,000 ft2 of BSL-4 and 50,000 ft2 of BSL-3 laboratory space. BSL-4, the highest containment level, included <b>laboratory</b> <b>suites</b> that are isolated by internal walls and protected by rigorous entry restrictions, air-locks, negative-pressure air-handling systems, and filtration of all out-flow air through high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters. Workers in BSL-4 laboratories also wore filtered positive-pressure total body suits, which isolated the workers from the internal air of the laboratory. BSL-3 laboratories had a similar design, but do not require that personnel wear positive-pressure suits. Workers in BSL-3 suites were protected immunologically by vaccines. U.S. governmental standards provided guidance as to which organisms might be handled under various containment levels in laboratories such as USAMRIID.|$|R

40|$|Background: Platelets are {{involved}} in the thromboses that are central to myocardial infarctions and ischemic strokes. Such adverse cardiovascular events have day/night patterns with peaks in the morning (, 9 AM), potentially related to endogenous circadian clock control of platelet activation. The objective was to test if the human endogenous circadian system influences (1) platelet function and (2) platelet response to standardized behavioral stressors. We also aimed to compare the magnitude of any effects on platelet function caused by the circadian system with that caused by varied standardized behavioral stressors, including mental arithmetic, passive postural tilt and mild cycling exercise. Methodology/Principal Findings: We studied 12 healthy adults (6 female) who lived in individual <b>laboratory</b> <b>suites</b> in dim light for 240 h, with all behaviors scheduled on a 20 -h recurring cycle to permit assessment of endogenous circadian function independent from environmental and behavioral effects including the sleep/wake cycle. Circadian phase was assessed from core body temperature. There were highly significant endogenous circadian rhythms in platelet surface activated glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa, GPIb and P-selectin (6 – 17 % peak-trough amplitudes; p# 0. 01). These circadian peaks occurred at a circadian phase corresponding to 8 – 9 AM. Platelet count, ATP release, aggregability, and plasma epinephrine also had significant circadian rhythms but with later peaks (corresponding to 3 – 8 PM). The circadian effects on the platelet activation markers were always larger than that of any of the three behavioral stressors...|$|R
40|$|The {{most common}} {{procedures}} for characterizing the chemical components of lignocellulosic feedstocks use a two-stage sulfuric acid hydrolysis to fractionate biomass for gravimetric and instrumental analyses. The uncertainty (i. e., dispersion of values from repeated measurement) {{in the primary}} data is of general interest to those with technical or financial interests in biomass conversion technology. The composition of a homogenized corn stover feedstock (154 replicate samples in 13 batches, by 7 analysts in 2 laboratories) was measured along with a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) reference sugar cane bagasse, as a control, using this <b>laboratory's</b> <b>suite</b> of <b>laboratory</b> analytical procedures (LAPs). The uncertainty was evaluated by the statistical analysis of these data and is reported as the standard deviation of each component measurement. Censored and uncensored versions of these data sets are reported, as evidence was found for intermittent instrumental and equipment problems. The censored data are believed to represent the “best case” results of these analyses, whereas the uncensored data show how small method changes can strongly affect the uncertainties of these empirical methods. Relative standard deviations (RSD) of 1 − 3 % are reported for glucan, xylan, lignin, extractives, and total component closure with the other minor components showing 4 − 10 % RSD. The standard deviations seen with the corn stover and NIST bagasse materials were similar, {{which suggests that the}} uncertainties reported here are due more to the analytical method used than to the specific feedstock type being analyzed...|$|R
