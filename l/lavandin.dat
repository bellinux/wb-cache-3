In order to establish these possible bases, we compared the titers of stolbur phytoplasma in the leaves and shoots of different lavenders and <b>lavandins,</b> either sensitive or tolerant.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the possibility to organically cultivate lavender (Lavandula angustifolia Miller) and <b>lavandin</b> (Lavandula hybrida Reverchon), under the pedo-climatic conditions of central Italy. So, the growth and productive parameters {{as well as the}} essential oil content and composition of one lavender cultivar (Mailette) and three <b>lavandin</b> cultivars (Sumiens, Super A and Grosso) were assessed through 2 -year field experiment (2014 and 2015 growing season). The results showed that the cold sensitivity of both lavender and <b>lavandin</b> plants decreased with ageing. Along the two years of cultivation, stem and inflorescences yields remained stable, and the <b>lavandin</b> cultivar Super A showed always the higher yields in comparison with the other varieties. A slight increase of essential oil (EO) yield was observed for the three cultivars of <b>lavandin</b> during the second year of experiment (2015), while the EO yield of lavender showed a slight decrease. The composition of these essential oils highlighted an important variation which affected all the classes of compounds, except for oxygenated monoterpenes (OM).

40|$|The Lavandula genus, which {{includes}} lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) and <b>lavandin</b> (L. angustifolia x Lavandula latifolia), is cultivated worldwide for its essential oils, which find applications in perfumes, cosmetics, food processing and, more recently, in aromatherapy products. The chemical composition of lavender and <b>lavandin</b> essential oils, usually produced by steam distillation from the flowering stems, {{is characterized by}} the presence of terpenes (e. g. linalool and linalyl acetate) and terpenoids (e. g. 1, 8 -cineole), which are mainly responsible for their characteristic flavour and their biological and therapeutic properties. Lavender and <b>lavandin</b> distilled straws, the by-products of oil extraction, were traditionally used for soil replenishment or converted to a fuel source. They are mineral- and carbon-rich plant residues and, therefore, a cheap, readily available source of valuable substances of industrial interest, especially aroma and antioxidants (e. g. terpenoids, lactones and phenolic compounds including coumarin, herniarin, alpha-bisabolol, rosmarinic and chlorogenic acids). Accordingly, recent studies have emphasized the possible uses of lavender and <b>lavandin</b> straws in fermentative or enzymatic processes involving various microorganisms, especially filamentous fungi, for the production of antimicrobials, antioxidants and other bioproducts with pharmaceutical and cosmetic activities, opening up new challenging perspectives in white biotechnology applications...|$|E

40|$|Essential oils {{extracted}} from bay laurel (Laurus nobilis), bergamot (Citrus bergamia), fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) and <b>lavandin</b> (Lavandula hybrida) were tested for repellency against Sitophilus zeamais and Cryptolestes ferrugineus adults and Tenebrio molitor larvae. Composition of L. nobilis essential oil included {{large amounts of}} monoterpenes, mainly oxygenated derivatives, while in C. bergamia essential oil limonene was the main compound followed by linalyl acetate and g-terpinene and linalool. In <b>lavandin</b> oil there was a prevalence of linalool and linalyl acetate, while phenyl propanoids were the main compounds detected in fennel essential oil. Two kinds of bioassays were performed: filter paper tests, carried out in Petri dishes on all three coleopteran species and tests on treated kernels carried out only on S. zeamais adults. In filter paper bioassays, essential oils showed different activity: on S. zeamais, fennel after 3 h of exposure and bergamot after 24 h exerted the highest repellency, similar results were obtained for C. ferrugineus, but <b>lavandin</b> also showed good repellent activity, while for T. molitor larvae bay laurel was the most effective repellent. Repellency tests on kernels against S. zeamais adults suggested that bergamot and <b>lavandin</b> were the most efficient oils.

40|$|Cixiid planthoppers are {{considered}} of major economic importance, {{as they can}} transmit phytoplasmas responsible for many plant diseases. While thorougly studied in vineyards, the epidemiology of stolbur phytoplasma, transmitted by Hyalesthes obsoletus Signoret, was rarely investigated on minor crops as lavender, where it leads to ‘yellow decline’ disease and large economic losses. The objective {{of this paper is}} to understand the effect of the local landscape characteristics on the presence and density of H. obsoletus in the ‘Plateau de Valensole’, southern France. Potential host plants of H. obsoletus were surveyed in three contrasted zones (in terms of crops and disease intensity), by uprooting plants and capturing adults in emergence traps. The localization and potential movements of H. obsoletus from the host plants towards <b>lavandin</b> (infertile hybrid of lavender) were determined using yellow sticky traps. Clary sage plants were found as major hosts of H. obsoletus. Flying insects were also caught in fields of <b>lavandin,</b> although emergence traps and plant uprooting did not confirm this crop as a winter host, i. e., as a reservoir for the insect. Based on one zone, we showed that attractiveness may depend on crop (clary sage or <b>lavandin)</b> and on its age, as well as on the distance to the supposed source field. These results suggest that clary sage could be an important host of H. obsoletus, whose density largely varies between zones.
