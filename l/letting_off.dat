25|$|Nusrat Bhutto, {{the wife}} of the deposed Prime Minister, filed a suit against Zia's {{military}} regime, challenging the validity of the July 1977 military coup. The Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled, in what would later be known as the Doctrine of Necessity (not {{to be confused with the}} 1954 Doctrine of necessity) that, given the dangerously unstable political situation of the time, Zia's overthrowing of the Bhutto government was legal on the grounds of necessity. The judgement tightened the general's hold on the government. When Bhutto appeared personally to argue his appeal in the supreme court, he almost affirmed his concurrence with the judges present for not <b>letting</b> <b>off</b> a judgement without imposing some conditions on ruling military government.|$|E
25|$|The second {{mechanism}} {{is a force}} imbalance at the calving front due to thinning causing a substantial non-linear response. In this case an imbalance of forces at the calving front propagates up-glacier. Thinning causes the glacier to be more buoyant, reducing frictional back forces, as the glacier becomes more afloat at the calving front. The reduced friction due to greater buoyancy allows {{for an increase in}} velocity. This is akin to <b>letting</b> <b>off</b> the emergency brake a bit. The reduced resistive force at the calving front is then propagated up-glacier via longitudinal extension because of the backforce reduction. For ice streaming sections of large outlet glaciers (in Antarctica as well) there is always water {{at the base of the}} glacier that helps lubricate the flow.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{instances}} of conflict in recent years between some Roma supporters and fans of English clubs, and the subsequent violence outside the stadium which saw a number of Liverpool fans stabbed. Since then, there have been further instances of some English supporters being attacked and stabbed in Rome, including incidents in 2001 when Liverpool visited Roma twice and subsequent clashes with Middlesbrough fans in 2006 and Manchester United fans in 2007. In March 2009, a coach carrying Arsenal supporters was attacked by a group of Roma ultras just outside the Stadio Olimpico. The coach's windows were smashed and at least one person entered the vehicle, <b>letting</b> <b>off</b> a flare and stabbed a supporter in the knee.|$|E

25|$|On September 11, 2001, {{the station}} was shut down by the Port Authority after the first {{airplane}} hit the North Tower of the World Trade Center. In the minutes after the first plane hit at 8:46am, three PATH trains were pulling into the station. One was arriving from Newark and two others from Hoboken. The first Hoboken train turned around without stopping, not <b>letting</b> <b>off</b> passengers or opening any doors. The second Hoboken train arrived on track 3 at 8:52 a.m., was ordered to be evacuated, employees included. This train never left the World Trade Center complex and was found later in 2001 during the long recovery process. The train from Newark that came into the terminal at 8:55 a.m. stopped only to pick up passengers. An empty train {{was sent to the}} station at 9:10 a.m. to pick up a dozen PATH employees and a homeless individual, leaving the station empty.|$|E
25|$|Uhura recognizes Curate Prime as Gary Mitchell, {{a friend}} of James T. Kirk, who had been granted {{formidable}} mental power after passing through the galactic barrier forty years earlier. Insanely believing himself a living god, Mitchell was defeated by Kirk in the real timeline; in the altered timeline, with Kirk not there to stop him, Mitchell was able to kill {{the captain of the}} Enterprise – in this case, Christopher Pike – and take control of the United Federation of Planets, refounding it as the Galactic Order. As they escape into the ship, a fleet of Kittrick's allies, led by Captain Galt (Herbert Jefferson, Jr.) of the free ship Liberty, engages the Conqueror, with Curate Prime leading a fleet of his own to destroy Kittrick and his rebellion. While Chekov and Harriman take control of the Conqueror, Uhura transports to the surface. Mitchell follows her, believing her to be Chekov/Kittrick, and tortures her, demanding his location. Charlie Evans steps in to protect her, using his Thasian-granted powers to battle the godlike Mitchell. Beaten, Mitchell transports Janice Rand (Grace Lee Whitney) – the first woman Evans had ever met, when he was taken aboard the Enterprise – to distract him, <b>letting</b> <b>off</b> one last burst of energy before escaping to his flagship. Angered and weakened, Mitchell orders the firing of his ship's Omega device, which will destroy both the captured Conqueror and the planet.|$|E
500|$|The title's {{controls}} and overall gameplay {{were not as}} well-received, with certain critics questioning their accuracy and depth. MacDonald finished every level in first place within one hour using {{only one of the}} four initial characters. While the game also features a hard mode, MacDonald concluded that [...] "Sonic R has more in the personality department than in the depth department". MacDonald and Reiner cited finding the Chaos Emeralds and hidden coins as [...] "difficult", but MacDonald argued that such optional tasks offered little in return, because the hidden characters [...] "are mostly robot versions of the already playable ones". Moreover, Sackenheim noted that the game's controls initially [...] "take some practice to get used to", but added: [...] "Start sliding around corners and <b>letting</b> <b>off</b> the gas at the right times and you'll be finding all of the secrets that Sonic R conceals in no time". Likewise, Nutter called the controls [...] "initially tricky... but incredibly playable," [...] Next Generation stated [...] "the proper techniques, with time, can be learned," [...] and John concluded [...] "once you get used to it, you'll find a real solid game". The latter reviewer thought the game played better with the digital pad as opposed to Sega's analogue controller. Dan Elektro agreed that the controls were [...] "responsive", but [...] "to a fault": [...] "At high speeds, it's nearly impossible to run in a straight line".|$|E

Ali told the court {{that he intended to}} make a political statement by <b>letting</b> <b>off</b> a small device at Heathrow and scaring people, and that the plot did not involve attacking planes. All the accused, except for Gulzar, admitted plotting to cause a public nuisance. [...] Ali, Sarwar and Hussein also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to cause explosions.|$|E
2500|$|The SHAC {{campaign}} targeted {{anyone who}} worked for or did business with HLS. This could entail protesters standing outside homes, blowing whistles and <b>letting</b> <b>off</b> fireworks throughout the night, spraying graffiti on property, breaking windows, spreading rumours to neighbours that the target was a paedophile, and sending hoax bombs and obscene mail. Threats of violence were signed {{on behalf of the}} Animal Liberation Front or Animal Rights Militia. The police and courts regarded the SHAC campaign as an example of [...] "urban terrorism". Nicholson described it as [...] "a straightforward battle between good and evil, mercy and money, compassion and cruelty." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{was some}} initial cynicism among the Chinese {{public about the}} intent of the {{campaign}} and its effectiveness. Earlier on, domestic and international observers commented on the possibility that the campaign is an emblematic feature of Chinese political culture which has, since its imperial days, invariably attempted tackling corruption in a high-profile manner when a new leader comes to power. The 2014 ranking of countries by the Corruption Perceptions Index actually ranked China lower than a year before, falling to 100th from 80th place. [...] However, the extent and reach of the campaign has surprised even the most seasoned Chinese political observers. As of the second quarter of 2015, the campaign continues to plow ahead without any signs of <b>letting</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{next table}} had held {{a group of}} ten friends, but some had just left the table to return their meal trays and visit the gift shop. Bryant fired one shot that killed Kevin Vincent Sharp, 68. The second hit Walter Bennett, 66, passed through his body and struck Raymond John Sharp, 67, Kevin Sharp's brother, killing both. The three had their backs towards Bryant, and were unaware what was happening. They at first {{believed}} someone was <b>letting</b> <b>off</b> firecrackers. One of them made the comment [...] "That's not funny" [...] after hearing the first few shots, not realizing that they were real. The shots were all close range, with the gun at, or just inches away from, {{the back of their}} heads. Gerald Broome, Gaye Fidler and her husband John were all struck by bullet fragments, but survived.|$|E
2500|$|At 02:15, five British {{ships of}} the 13th Destroyer Flotilla under Captain James Uchtred Farie regrouped and headed south. At 02:25, they sighted {{the rear of}} the German line. [...] inquired of the leader [...] as to whether he thought they were British or German ships. Answering that he thought they were German, Farie then veered off to the east and away from the German line. All but Moresby in the rear followed, as through the gloom she sighted what she thought were four pre-dreadnought battleships [...] away. She hoisted a flag signal {{indicating}} that the enemy was to the west and then closed to firing range, <b>letting</b> <b>off</b> a torpedo set for high running at 02:37, then veering off to rejoin her flotilla. The four pre-dreadnought battleships were in fact two pre-dreadnoughts, Schleswig-Holstein and , and the battlecruisers Von der Tann and Derfflinger. Von der Tann sighted the torpedo and was forced to steer sharply to starboard to avoid it as it passed close to her bows. Moresby rejoined Champion convinced she had scored a hit.|$|E
2500|$|At the Doullens Conference (26 March), Haig {{accepted}} {{the appointment of}} Foch to coordinate reserves of all nationalities wherever he saw fit. In his typed diary Haig claimed {{much of the credit}} for Foch's appointment and to have insisted that he have wider powers over Petain than Clemenceau had wanted to grant him. However, the typed version of Haig's diary, although fuller, does not specifically contradict the handwritten original, and {{it has been suggested that}} Haig either needed to reconcile himself psychologically to the need to accept a French superior or else was simply <b>letting</b> <b>off</b> steam and wanted to give himself the credit he felt he deserved. Milner, who represented the British government at Doullens, recorded that Clemenceau was unhappy with Petain's recent efforts, but claimed that he himself had persuaded Haig to accept the appointment of Foch; Haig's official biographer Duff Cooper gave Haig the credit but commented that the idea had probably occurred to several participants simultaneously. Wilson recorded that Haig seemed [...] "10 years younger" [...] that evening after Doullens.|$|E

He thought it was Tom's ghost, you see.|$|R
2500|$|The 1963 {{game between}} Victoria and South Australia at the MCG was also of {{significance}} in the rivalry between the two states. [...] Before the game Jack Dyer was asked {{what he would do}} if he was coaching Victoria, and said, [...] "I'd give them a Pep Talk and go to the races". [...] Neil Kerley who was playing, was in an interview before the game when this was mentioned. [...] After it was said the interviewer said to Kerley [...] "what {{do you think of that}} young Kerley", in which he responded [...] "everyone is entitled to their opinion". Kerley angered by this, as a result told teammates before the game [...] "something is going to happen at the first Bounce" [...] and then put down a Victorian player with a [...] "Hip and Shoulder". [...] Kerley also injured another Victorian in the last quarter which saw him leave the field. [...] It was a drought breaking win for South Australia in Victoria. [...] When the South Australians returned to Adelaide they were greeted with a heroic welcome, with nearly 8,000 people attending in poor weather, with the crowd hurling streamers and <b>letting</b> <b>off</b> fire crackers, with hundreds surging onto the Tarmac.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were three}} {{conferences}} at Doullens on 26 March. The first was between Haig and his Army Commanders (except Gough). There {{was then a}} second with them and Wilson and Milner, {{who was able to}} bring assurances of French help from Clemenceau and Foch. The main conference was attended by Poincare, Clemenceau, Petain and Foch, as well as Haig, Wilson and Milner. Haig accepted the appointment of Foch to coordinate reserves of all nationalities wherever he saw fit. In his typed diary Haig claimed much of the credit for Foch’s appointment and to have insisted that he have wider powers over Petain across the whole front, not just the Amiens sector, than Clemenceau had wanted to grant him. The typed diary, although fuller, does not specifically contradict the handwritten original, and Sheffield's view is that Haig either needed to reconcile himself psychologically to the need to accept a French superior or else was simply <b>letting</b> <b>off</b> steam and wanted to give himself the credit he felt he deserved. Milner, who represented the British government at Doullens, recorded that Clemenceau was unhappy with Petain's recent efforts, but claimed that he himself had persuaded Haig to accept the appointment of Foch; Haig's official biographer Duff Cooper gave Haig the credit but commented that the idea had probably occurred to several participants simultaneously. In his diary for that day Haig accused Petain of [...] "funk". He was later to make the same accusation against the King on 29 March and Lloyd George on 3 April; Harris suggests that he was attributing to others an emotion of which he felt ashamed in himself. After the conference Haig went riding (his main form of relaxation) {{for the first time in}} days, and Wilson recorded that he seemed “10 years younger” that evening.|$|E
2500|$|On November 2, 1998, Saddle Creek {{released}} <b>Letting</b> <b>Off</b> the Happiness, a ten-track {{album that}} displayed a more focused and clearer sound {{than the previous}} album. According to the Saddle Creek press release, it features members of Lullaby for the Working Class, Neutral Milk Hotel, and of Montreal. Park Ave. bandmate Neely Jenkins also contributed vocals. It was predominantly recorded in the Oberst family basement in Omaha on an analog eight track reel to reel; with some work also done at keyboardist Andy Lemaster's Athens, Georgia studio. Although {{almost all of the}} tracks feature a full band, [...] "June on the West Coast" [...] is performed with only acoustic guitar and vocals. [...] "Padraic My Prince" [...] gives a dramatic fictional account of the death of his baby brother, a story with a multitude of symbolic meanings. Oberst has referenced the song [...] "Padraic My Prince" [...] more than once in his music. The song [...] "An Attempt To Tip the Scales" [...] on the album [...] "Fevers and Mirrors" [...] has a faux interview {{near the end of the}} track (Oberst voiced by Todd Fink), who was a labelmate and had played in other bands with Oberst. The interviewer is Matt Silcock, another labelmate on Saddle Creek Records. The interview was meant to be somewhat sarcastic and most of what the Oberst impersonator said was not true. At one point the interviewer asks the question: [...] "So some of these references like babies in bathtubs are not biographical?" [...] The Oberst impersonator replies: [...] "Well I did have a brother who died in a bathtub [...] [...] [...] he drowned. Well actually I had five brothers that drowned." [...] "No, I'm serious. My mother drowned one every year for five consecutive years. They were all named Padraic, and that's why they only got one song. It's kind of like walking out a door and discovering that it's a window." [...] Oberst also references the song in [...] "Cartoon Blues" [...] on the Four Winds EP.|$|E
