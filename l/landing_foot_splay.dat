40|$|Toxicol. 10, 413 - 424. 2, 4 -Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) is a {{commonly}} used herbicide and {{one component of}} Agent Orange. The subchronic neurobehavioral toxicity of 2, 4 -D-zj-butyl ester (2, 4 -D ester) was assessed in rats by monitoring performance in a battery of behavioral tests. 2, 4 -D ester was injected daily (150 - 250 mg/kg sc) in four successive 14 -day periods. Five-to eight-day exposure-free periods separated dosing escalations. All doses produced {{a significant decrease in}} schedule-controlled lever pressing and photocell locomotor activity while increasing <b>landing</b> <b>foot</b> <b>splay.</b> Peak effects occurred by the 3 rd injection, while tolerance developed by the 10 th injection. Neurobehavioral effects associated with 2, 4 -D ester exposure were rapidly reversible and disappeared within 24 - 48 hr. Brain and blood 2, 4 -D kinetics revealed that the compound accumulated in brain with repeated dosing. This observation indicates a cellular mechanism for tolerance development. Other neurobehavioral measures, rota rod and grip strength, were not consistently affected by 2, 4 -D ester. These studies confirm that 2, 4 -D ester produces behavioral toxicity, that tolerance develops to the 2, 4 -D ester-induced behavioral deficits with repeated exposures, and that a cellular mechanism appears to be responsible for the developed tolerance to 2, 4 -D ester. © 1988 Society of Toxicology...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of the}} {{international}} Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) Collaborative Study on Neurobehavioral Screening Methods {{was to determine the}} intra-and inter-laboratory reliability of a functional observational battery (FOB) and an automated assessment of motor activity in eight laboratories worldwide. The control data were crucial to the outcome of the studies in terms of sensitivity and reliability of the lest measures, which in turn impact on the between-laboratory comparisons of chemical effects. In addition, analyses of control data can aid in determining endpoints that may require modification to improve their sensitivity and reliability. The control data from the eight laboratories were examined in terms of the following parameters: 1) control variability within studies for each laboratory; 2) within-laboratory replicability of control values across studies; 3) within-laboratory stability of control values over the course of testing for a given study; and 4) between-laboratory comparisons of parameters (1), (2), and (3). The analyses indicated considerable differences across endpoints, wherein some measures showed high variability and little replicability, while others were extremely reproducible. Generally, there were similar ranges of variability and replicability of control data across laboratories, although in some cases one or two laboratories were markedly different from the others. The physiological (weight, body temperature) and neuromuscular (grip strength, <b>landing</b> <b>foot</b> <b>splay)</b> endpoints exhibited the least variability, whereas the subjective assessments of reactivity varied the most. These data indicate a reasonable degree of comparability in the data generated in the participating laboratories. (C) 1997 Intox Press, Inc...|$|E

50|$|Cats are {{commonly}} cow-hocked, with the hind legs angling inward {{at the knee}} and the <b>feet</b> <b>splaying</b> outward more than forward. Mild cow-hocking is negligible, and kittens often look a little cow-hocked, but if the defect is severe, the resulting poor alignment can damage the joints and spine. A similar deviation may occur in the vertical alignment of a dog's rear structure.|$|R
50|$|Those who overpronate tend to {{push off}} almost {{completely}} {{from the big}} toe and second toe. As a result, the shock from the foot’s impact doesn’t spread evenly throughout the foot and the ankle has trouble stabilizing {{the rest of the}} body. Additionally, an unnatural angle forms between the foot and ankle and the <b>foot</b> <b>splays</b> out abnormally. It is common even for people who pronate normally to have some angle between the foot and the ankle, but not to the extent seen in those who overpronate. In normal pronation the weight distributes evenly throughout the foot.|$|R

40|$|Brachyphalangy, {{polydactyly}} and tibial aplasia/hypoplasia syndrome (OMIM 609945) {{is a rare}} congenital disorder. Only seven {{patients have}} been reported to date, and the etiology of this syndrome is unknown. Autosomal dominant inheritance with variable expression has been suggested based on the presence of minor features in some parents and the fact that neither parental consanguinity nor pairs of affected siblings were observed. We report on the first patient with this syndrome who was born to consanguineous parents. Neither the mother nor the father, who were first cousins, had clinical features suggestive of a manifestation of brachyphalangy, polydactyly and tibial aplasia/hypoplasia syndrome. The patient had no siblings, and the family history was unremarkable. Clinical problems included brachydactyly of hands and <b>feet,</b> <b>splaying</b> of fingers and toes, preaxial polydactyly of feet, bilateral tibial aplasia, shortened radius and ulna, and characteristic facial dysmorphic signs. The detailed description of this patient adds to our knowledge of the clinical manifestations of brachyphalangy, polydactyly and tibial aplasia/hypoplasia syndrome and will eventually also contribute to the elucidation of the underlying gene defects...|$|R

5000|$|Temporary sheers {{comprise}} two upright spars, lashed {{together at}} {{their heads and}} their <b>feet</b> <b>splayed</b> apart. Unlike in a gyn, which has three legs and is thus stable without support, stability in sheers (derricks, and single-legged gin poles) is provided by a guy. [...] The heels of the spars are secured by splay and heel tackles. The point {{at the top of}} the sheers where the spars cross and are lashed together is the [...] "crutch", to which a block and tackle is attached. Unlike derricks, sheers need no lateral support, and only require either a foreguy and an aftguy or a martingale and a topping lift. Being made of two spars rather than one, sheers are stronger than a derrick of the same size and made of equivalent materials. Unlike the apex of a gyn, which is fixed, the crutch of a sheers can be topped up or lowered, via the topping lift, through a limited angle. In the era of sailing vessels, it was common for dockyards to employ a sheer hulk, an old floating ship's hull fitted with sheer legs, and used to install masts in other ships.|$|R
