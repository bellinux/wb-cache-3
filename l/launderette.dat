500|$|Throughout {{her time}} in EastEnders, many of Dot's scenes have been set in Walford's <b>launderette,</b> where the {{character}} has worked as an assistant for almost the entire duration of {{her time in}} EastEnders. Here, Dot was frequently featured with another long-running protagonist, fellow <b>launderette</b> colleague, Pauline Fowler, played by Wendy Richard from 1985–2006. Author Christine Geraghty has discussed the working environment the women inhabited, indicating that because {{the owner of the}} <b>launderette</b> is barely present, the [...] "working relationship hinges on the friendships (or otherwise) of the women who work in it". As with Ethel, Dot and Pauline's friendship was often used for comedic purposes; emphasis was placed on their differences, leading to numerous petty squabbles and in 2004 saw them [...] "buried alive" [...] underneath a collapsed fairground ride, {{in the midst of a}} cake-selling war.

It showed him coming into a <b>launderette</b> to wash his 501 jeans, wearing only white boxer shorts. As he strips down he is watched {{by a group of}} women in the <b>launderette.</b> The advertisement had immediate impact, with Levi's sales increasing by 800% and making it the number one jeans manufacturer. It also made Kamen a household name and a sex symbol. Singer Marvin Gaye's [...] "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" [...] was featured in the commercial and its sales were also boosted, resulting in the song reaching number eight on the UK Singles Chart.|$|E
500|$|Although Dot {{had been}} {{referred}} to since the very early episodes of the programme {{as the mother of}} villain Nick Cotton (John Altman), she did not actually appear on-screen until episode 40 in July 1985. Dot was conceptualised by show creators, Tony Holland and Julia Smith, along with the other original characters. Introduced as the [...] "bible thumping, arch-gossip" [...] of the <b>launderette,</b> Dot was a character who bridged the generations. The actress June Brown was given the role after being recommended by actor Leslie Grantham, who played original character, Den Watts.|$|E
500|$|He {{had always}} been a heavy drinker, but in 1987 he fell ill while working with Rod Clements and Marty Craggs, and was rushed to hospital, where he was told that he was [...] "as seriously ill as you can be without dying" [...] and that he had a choice of [...] "giving up alcohol or simply giving up." [...] He chose the former option: Colin Harper states that [...] "There {{can be no doubt that}} Bert's creativity, reliability, energy, {{commitment}} and quality of performance were all rescued dramatically by the decision to quit boozing." [...] Jansch and Clements continued the work they had started before Jansch's illness, resulting in the 1988 Leather <b>Launderette</b> album.|$|E

500|$|The Christmas Day episodes, {{written by}} Simon Ashdown, {{drew on the}} show's early history to mark the {{occasion}} of Pauline's exit, which was particularly emphasised {{by the use of}} flashback vocal snippets of several members of Pauline's deceased family. The critic for The Times, Tim Teeman, commented that [...] "Wendy Richard as Pauline had the air of the departing diva, queen of all she had loved, lost and laid waste to, her face set in a silent snarl." [...] In addition, her parting scene with the other EastEnders long-serving [...] "grand dame" [...] Dot Cotton (played by June Brown) has also been praised, with Teeman commenting: [...] "The really choking scene came in the <b>launderette</b> between Pauline and Dot... Here the two grand dames had worked, bitched and consoled for years. Richard and the wonderful June Brown played their final encounter as intensely as the characters deserved." ...|$|E
500|$|From the beginning, Smith {{considered}} the role ideal for Wendy Richard, {{with whom she}} had worked on the 1960s BBC soap, The Newcomers; [...] Holland and Smith decided to approach her about the role, even though their casting policy was not to use [...] "stars"—Richard was already well known in the UK for playing glamorous roles, such as Shirley Brahms in the successful sitcom Are You Being Served? At their first meeting, Tony Holland informed Richard that they were planning a programme that would not [...] "duck social issues but would be a hard-hitting drama including teenage pregnancy, drugs, racial conflict, prostitution, rape, mental illness, homosexuality, alcoholism, and muggings among its subjects." [...] In order to carry such controversial storylines, Richard was told that [...] "powerful characters to whom things just naturally happened" [...] had been invented, and two families, the Fowlers and the Beales, were to form the core of the soap's narrative. In her autobiography, Richard states, [...] "If I accepted, my character was to be Pauline Fowler. A middle-aged mother of two teenagers, with a late baby on the way, Pauline worked part-time at the <b>launderette,</b> voted Labour and supported Arsenal. She was married to Arthur, who was out of work and was really a bit of a failure, not much good at anything in life." [...] Richard thought it sounded like a challenging role.|$|E
500|$|Pauline is {{a member}} of the Beale family. Her storylines focus on drudgery, money worries and family troubles. The matriarchal stalwart of the fictional London {{community}} of Albert Square, she was [...] portrayed as a loving, doting [...] mother who was very family-oriented. In later years however, she became a more stoic, opinionated battle-axe who alienated her relatives through overbearing interference. Pauline's marriage to the downtrodden Arthur after finding out he had a one night stand with Christine Hewitt, which lead to her hitting him with a frying pan. Their marriage remained rocky until his death in 1996. She was used for comedic purposes in scenes with her <b>launderette</b> colleague, Dot Cotton, and scriptwriters included many feuds in her narrative, most notably with her daughter-in-law, Sonia, and Den Watts, a family friend who got her daughter, Michelle, pregnant at just 16. A famous episode in 1986, which included Pauline discovering that Den was the father of Michelle's baby, drew over 30million viewers, and was listed at Number 36 in The Times 1998 list of [...] "Top 100 cult moments in Film". Wendy Richard announced Pauline's retirement from the serial in July 2006, and the character was killed off in a [...] "whodunnit?" [...] murder storyline, with Richard making her final appearance on 25 December 2006. Pauline's voice is later heard during the episode broadcast on 24 December 2016.|$|E

500|$|Dorothy [...] "Dot" [...] Branning (also Cotton) is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the BBC soap opera, EastEnders, played by June Brown since 1985. Dot {{first appeared in}} EastEnders in July 1985 {{as the mother of}} criminal Nick Cotton (John Altman). The character has worked as a <b>launderette</b> assistant for most of that time along with original character Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard). Dot moved away with her son and his family in 1993. In reality, Brown left the show in 1993, unhappy with the axing of her co star Peter Dean, who played Pete Beale from the shows first episode to early 1993. Brown returned to the role in 1997, and Dot was shown moving back to Albert Square, and has continued since that time. On 28 April 2017, Dot overtook Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement) as the second longest-serving character in EastEnders, surpassed only by original character Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). In a special episode entitled EastEnders: Dot's Story (2003) a young Dot was played by Tallulah Pitt-Brown in flashbacks. In April 2012, Brown took a six-month break from the show to write her memoirs. Dot temporarily departed on 18 May 2012. She returned on 14 January 2013. In February 2015, Dot began appearing less frequently due to Brown gradually losing her eyesight; this aspect of her life was later written into her character the following year. In January 2016, it was announced that Brown had renewed her contract with the BBC until March 2017. Brown is now the oldest soap opera actress in Britain. In January 2017 it was reported that the BBC were offering Brown £300,000 for a one-year contract.|$|E
500|$|As well {{as being}} tragic, Dot is scripted as a comic character. Brown has {{discussed}} the humour she incorporates into her performances: [...] "I think Dot would be awfully boring if she weren't a bit comic [...] I always thought I had to put an edge on it, an edge of comedy, which just means doing it more seriously than you would do. If {{you want to play}} comedy then {{you have to be very}} intense about it [...] very, very serious." [...] Some of Dot's catchphrases are used for humour, such as [...] "Ooh I say!", uttered when she is [...] "stuck for words". In 2004, Brown discussed the origin of the saying: [...] "It was written once in the script and I quite enjoyed it, so I used to say it occasionally when it wasn't in the scripts. It was useful because it could be said in all different ways. Dot's very straight-laced, so it helped to express her horror at what went on." [...] Brown revealed in 2008 that she has tried to cut down the use of this, along with the mispronunciation of her employer, Mr Papadopolous, as she has become a little embarrassed by them now they are so known. Mr. Papadopolous is the owner of the <b>launderette</b> where Dot works. In a long-running joke, Dot has difficulty pronouncing his surname, and for much of the show's history he has been referred to as Mr. Oppodopolus, Oppydoppy, or varying other mispronunciations. Brown has said she enjoys playing the comical aspects of Dot, stating, [...] "She's not dreadfully funny but she's amusing and I like that because it lightens it up a bit." ...|$|E
