5|$|MercyMe {{wanted to}} get out of their comfort zone with the overall sound of the album, and brought in {{producer}} Dan Muckala. Millard has said that he initially wrote the songs on the album as poems and then the band worked on the music, meaning the band didn't think much about the overall length of the songs. MercyMe further developed the sound of the album by <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> work of The Beatles for inspiration.|$|E
5|$|The {{return of}} Lake and Hezmalhalch to America was an {{important}} turning point for the AFM. Le Roux was elected its president in 1913, a role he filled until 1943. During his leadership, the AFM distanced itself from the black Zionist movement with its distinctive taboos and dress and began <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Dutch Reformed heritage and respectability. During his leadership {{a large portion of}} the AFM's African constituency withdrew in 1919. Another schism occurred in 1928 when Maria Fraser led a number of AFM members to withdraw and form the Latter Rain Mission in South Africa. She and her followers, known as Blourokkies (Blue Dresses) for the dresses worn by female adherents, emphasized Holy Spirit-inspired prophecy to a degree seen as unbiblical, excessive and dangerous by AFM officials. The movement did, however, contribute to a re-emphasis on the work and presence of the Holy Spirit in the church and ministry.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} a closeup shot of Katy's face, {{surrounded}} by alternating red and blue lights, as she mouths the song's lyrics. It then changes to a mechanics' shop, where two young men are seen sitting, <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground. Shots of sparks then appear in the screen, which emerge from a car. Katy {{is sitting on the}} automobile's passenger seat, while looking to her love interest, who is repairing the car, seemingly worried. She is later seen being driven by her boyfriend's group in that car. Her boyfriend is seen lying on a bed, and looking at the mirror, looking distantly. The car seen before finally arrives in a car parking lot where other cars are driving in circles. They exit their cars while others start driving again. The video's final scenes take place at the car parking lot, while the cars keep driving, with shots of women and other men sitting on the cars. The visual finally closes with a similar shot to that seen in the beginning, of Katy's face surrounded by lights, though now, her face is mixed with her love interest's.|$|E

30|$|We {{hypothesized}} that if prediction error is higher near event boundaries, then our index of predictive looking would be effective; specifically, we predicted that <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> target {{object in the}} interval before contact would be less frequent or would tend to be later (closer to object contact) when objects were contacted near event boundaries than when objects were contacted during the middles of events. This amounts to predicting a main effect on <b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> target object (an overall reduction), an interaction (<b>looks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> target object shifting to be relatively later in time), or both.|$|R

25|$|The 1950s {{also saw}} Syria and Egypt attempt to unify as the United Arab Republic, {{and this was}} {{reflected}} in the Syrian Air Force with growth in personnel and aircraft. The union did not last. With the ascent to power of the Baath Party and Hafez Al-Assad, himself a former SAF Commander-in-chief, Syria began <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> members of the Warsaw Pact for help and built closer ties with the USSR. This in turn led to a huge influx of Eastern-made equipment to the Syrian Armed Forces, including the Air Force.|$|E

He returned to the athletics scene and continued his national success, winning in 1941 and 1943, although Henri Maignan took the title in 1942. He gradually moved towards training other athletes and he received his final selection for the national team in 1945, the year that France returned to international competition.|$|E
25|$|Extinction {{frequency}} {{may also}} be affected by reporting method, due to how visual processing interacts {{with the rest of}} the brain. Reported extinctions drop when the patient is told to relay the extinction news by a method other than speaking – particularly, the use of the eyes in a feedback loop (<b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> side if there is a single stimuli, and up if there are two). This may work by eliminating the need for hemispheric transfer of information – routing the response to the motor cortex instead of the visual cortex – and so shortening the path and response time, a conclusion supported by increased detection of isolated contralesional stimuli under such circumstances.|$|E

25|$|The British {{government}} accuses Moorthy of provoking {{the townspeople}} to inflict violence and arrests him. Though {{the committee is}} willing to pay his bail, Moorthy refuses their money. While Moorthy spends the next three months in prison, the women of Kanthapura take charge, forming a volunteer corps under Rangamma's leadership. Rangamma instills a sense of patriotism among the women by telling them stories of notable women from Indian history. They face police brutality, including assault and rape, when the village is attacked and burned. Upon Moorthy's release from prison, he is greeted by the loyal townspeople, who are now united regardless of caste. The novel ends with Moorthy and the town <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> future and planning to continue their fight for independence.|$|E

25|$|An {{illustration}} {{of the burden of}} proof is given in Howard Marine and Dredging Co Ltd v A Ogden & Sons (Excavations) Ltd, where a shipping company told a client that its barge for hire would hold 1600 tonnes. This is what the Lloyd's Register of ships said. But the ships own documents, accessible to the shipping company, said the barge could only take 1055. The Court of Appeal (Lord Denning MR dissenting) held that in preferring a more convenient source (the Lloyd's Register) over another (the shipping documents), the shipping company had not been reasonable. It was up to the shipping company to positively prove this, and in the circumstances <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> register was not reasonable. It is likely that a company's own standards and practices will be relevant to what constitutes reasonable grounds for a belief.|$|E
