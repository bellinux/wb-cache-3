500|$|Poulenc, {{a highly}} {{accomplished}} pianist, usually composed {{at the piano}} and wrote many pieces for the instrument throughout his career. In Henri Hell's view, Poulenc's piano writing {{can be divided into}} the percussive and the gentler style reminiscent of the harpsichord. Hell considers that the finest of Poulenc's music for piano is in the accompaniments to the songs, a view shared by Poulenc himself. The vast majority of the piano works are, {{in the view of the}} writer Keith W Daniel, [...] "what might be called 'miniatures'". Looking back at his piano music in the 1950s, the composer viewed it critically: [...] "I tolerate the Mouvements perpétuels, my old Suite en ut , and the Trois pieces. I <b>like</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> my two collections of Improvisations, an Intermezzo in A flat, and certain Nocturnes. I condemn Napoli and the Soirées de Nazelles without reprieve." ...|$|E
500|$|Stephen, born on Christmas Eve {{and named}} for the first martyr of Christianity, dreams as a child that [...] "in some queer way she [...] Jesus". When she discovers that Collins, object of her {{childhood}} crush, has housemaid's knee, she prays that the affliction be transferred to her: [...] "I would like to wash Collins in my blood, Lord Jesus– I would <b>like</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> to be a Saviour to Collins– I love her, and I want to be hurt like You were". This childish desire for martyrdom prefigures Stephen's ultimate self-sacrifice for Mary's sake. After she tricks Mary into leaving her– carrying out a plan that leads Valérie to exclaim [...] "you were made for a martyr!"– Stephen, left alone in her home, sees the room thronged with inverts, living, dead and unborn. They call on her to intercede with God for them, and finally possess her. It is with their collective voice that she demands of God, [...] "Give us also the right to our existence".|$|E

2500|$|A former Israeli diplomat, Itamar Rabinovich, criticised the {{efficacy}} of the force saying [...] "UNIFIL, I'm afraid, is a joke. They’ve been there for 26 years and since then, {{there have been so many}} skirmishes [...]" [...] Prime Minister Ehud Olmert also said [...] "We didn’t <b>like</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> UNIFIL which was very useless and very helpless. Look what happened. Did you hear of any particular efforts of the United Nations UNIFIL force in the south of Lebanon to prevent the attacks against Israel in the first place. So they were not useful and that is why we were unhappy with them." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Fool, a [...] "psychedelic fantasy", {{according}} to Clapton, was {{the brainchild of}} Marijke Koger who, along with Simon Postuma, was a founding member of The Fool collective. In early 1967, the collective were contacted by Robert Stigwood, then manager of Cream, to work on instruments and costumes for the band, which was about to leave London for a tour of the United States. Koger and Postuma painted Clapton's Gibson SG, a drum kit for Ginger Baker, and a Fender Bass VI for Jack Bruce, which he did not <b>like</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> and played only on TV performances.|$|E
2500|$|Unfortunately, Voigt {{caught the}} flu {{when she was}} to perform, yet went on with the show; the {{photograph}} caption for the New York Times review was, [...] "Deborah Voigt, even with the flu, led a Collegiate Chorale concert performance on Tuesday." [...] The reviewer wrote, [...] "she did some impressive work, singing with power, gleaming sound and sensitive phrasing, though she clearly struggled. Often her voice sounded congested and her top range tight ... her voice nearly gave out, {{and she had to}} drop down an octave to get though a phrase." [...] The review reserved judgment but noted that some fans were [...] "disappointed." [...] Another reviewer wrote, [...] "One would <b>like</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> to hear Voigt undertake this dramatic role again when she is in peak form." ...|$|E

I can't stand {{the idea that}} two million people are in {{imminent}} danger of starving to death, many of them children, [...] not because there isn't tons of food sitting in the northern port of Shoa. It can't be distributed. Last spring, Red Cross and UNICEF workers were ordered out of the northern provinces because of two simultaneous civil wars... I went into rebel country and saw mothers and their children who had walked for ten days, even three weeks, looking for food, settling onto the desert floor into makeshift camps where they may die. Horrible. That image {{is too much for}} me. The 'Third World' is a term I don't <b>like</b> <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> because we're all one world.

2500|$|Many {{commentators}} {{have pointed out}} that the 1953 English translation of The Second Sex by H. M. Parshley, frequently reissued, is poor. The reviewer from The New York Times described the zoologist hired to do the translation as having [...] "a college undergraduate’s knowledge of French." [...] The delicate vocabulary of philosophical concepts is frequently mistranslated, and great swaths of the text have been excised. [...] The English publication rights to the book are owned by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc and although the publishers had been made aware of the problems with the English text, they long stated that there was really no need for a new translation, even though Beauvoir herself explicitly requested one in a 1985 interview: [...] "I would <b>like</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> for another translation of The Second Sex to be done, one that is much more faithful; more complete and more faithful." ...|$|E
2500|$|Schuldiner was the {{youngest}} of three children: he had an older brother named Frank and an older sister named Bethann. He started playing guitar at the age of 9; his 16-year-old brother had died and his parents bought him a guitar, thinking it would help with his grief. He took classical lessons for less than a year in which his teacher taught him [...] "Mary had a Little Lamb", which he did not <b>like</b> <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> and almost stopped completely, until his parents saw an electric guitar at a yard sale and bought it for him. The young Schuldiner immediately took to the instrument. After getting amps, he never stopped playing, writing and teaching himself. Schuldiner was known to spend the weekend in the garage or his room playing his guitar, but was limited to three hours on weekdays when school was in session. Schuldiner first played in public in his early teens.|$|E
