Results showed that irrigation after 50 mm evaporation from pan class A, and plant inoculated with G. intraradices produced the highest grain yield (1678. 5 kg/ha and 1537. 6 kg/ha, respectively), total dry <b>weight,</b> <b>leaf</b> dry <b>weight,</b> <b>leaf</b> area index, crop growth rate, relative growth rate and net assimilation rate. In Contrast, irrigation after 200 mm evaporation from class A pan and non-inoculated treatment produced the lowest grain yeild (1159. 2 and 1301. 9 kg/ha, respectively). Reducing the irrigation distance led {{to an increase in}} total dry <b>weight,</b> <b>leaf</b> dry <b>weight,</b> <b>leaf</b> area index, crop growth rate, relative growth rate and net assimilation rate.

Ratios computed using these genetic parameters indicated the presence of partial dominance and unequal distribution {{of positive and negative}} alleles in the parents. The correlation between Wr + Vr and Yr was positive and significant only for petiole weight.

Vertical farming has proven to use less land and water than traditional farming while reducing fossil-fuel emissions and fertilizer waste. This study evaluated the production of Black Seeded Simpson lettuce, Lactuca sativa, to test the performance of two hydroponic tower systems, a commercially available tower and a student-designed tower in an indoor farming system in Richmond, KY. Each tower contained 24 plant compartments. The commercial tower compartments were evenly spaced on an eight-inch diameter, four-foot-tall pipe; the student-designed tower compartments were dispersed on two four-inch-diameter pipes that were four feet tall.
