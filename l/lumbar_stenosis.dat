50|$|There {{are several}} types of spinal stenosis, with <b>lumbar</b> <b>stenosis</b> and {{cervical}} stenosis being the most frequent.

5000|$|A {{laminotomy}} {{is typically}} used to relieve {{pressure from the}} spinal canal. Excessive pressure in the spinal canal causes the spinal canal and spinal nerves to be compressed which can be very painful and can impair motor control and/or sensation. A common disorder that causes increased pressure in the spinal canal is lumbar spinal stenosis. Lumbar spinal stenosis is formally defined as a decline in diameter length of either the neural foramina, lateral recess, or spinal canal. Stenosis is classified as a decaying disease because it causes the canal to gradually {{become more and more}} narrow which can cause pain or loss of function. Common symptoms of <b>lumbar</b> <b>stenosis</b> are pain, fatigue, weakness of the muscle and numbness. Stenosis can be caused by old age or an injury to the vertebral column and usually requires a CT scan or MRI to diagnose. Performing a laminotomy can relieve pressure in the spinal canal caused by <b>lumbar</b> <b>stenosis</b> and therefore alleviate symptoms.|$|E

40|$|Aim: <b>Lumbar</b> spinal <b>stenosis</b> is {{the most}} common cause of low back pain in the elderly. <b>Lumbar</b> spinal canal <b>stenosis</b> {{develops}} as a result of degenerative changes in the posterior canal including bone proliferation of the facet joints and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy. With this study, We aimed to contribute to the literature by demonstrating that ligamentum flavum hypertrophy in <b>lumbar</b> spinal <b>stenosis</b> may be directed by increased concentrations of TGF-β 1, at the stenosis site. Materials and Methods: In our study, TGF-βl concentrations in the ligamentum flavum samples taken from patients with lumbar disk hernia and <b>lumbar</b> spinal <b>stenosis</b> during surgical intervention. In addition, thickness of ligamentum flavum in these patients was calculated by averaging the lumbar MRI-tissue thickness, and all these results were statistically compared among the patients. Results: Ligamentum flavum thickness values in two groups were 3. 46 ± 1 mm in lumbar disk hernia and 5. 63 ± 1. 35 mm in <b>lumbar</b> spinal <b>stenosis</b> and the differences were statistically significant (p= 0. 000).

50|$|A {{study from}} Georgetown University {{reported}} on one-hundred {{patients who had}} undergone decompressive surgery for <b>lumbar</b> <b>stenosis</b> between 1980 and 1985. Four patients with postfusion stenosis were included. A 5-year follow-up period was achieved in 88 patients. The mean age was 67 years, and 80% were over 60 years of age. There was {{a high incidence of}} coexisting medical diseases, but the principal disability was <b>lumbar</b> <b>stenosis</b> with neurological involvement. Initially there was a high incidence of success, but recurrence of neurological involvement and persistence of low-back pain led to an increasing number of failures. By 5 years this number had reached 27% of the available population pool, suggesting that the failure rate could reach 50% within the projected life expectancies of most patients. Of the 26 failures, 16 were secondary to renewed neurological involvement, which occurred at new levels of stenosis in eight and recurrence of stenosis at operative levels in eight. Reoperation was successful in 12 of these 16 patients, but two required a third operation. The incidence of spondylolisthesis at 5 years was higher in the surgical failures (12 of 26 patients) than in the surgical successes (16 of 64). Spondylolisthetic stenosis tended to recur within a few years following decompression. Because of age and associated illnesses, fusion may be difficult to achieve in this group.|$|E

40|$|<b>Lumbar</b> <b>stenosis</b> is a {{well-defined}} pathologic condition with excellent surgical outcomes. Empiric evidence {{as well as}} randomized, prospective trials has demonstrated the superior efficacy of surgery compared to medical management for <b>lumbar</b> <b>stenosis.</b> Traditionally, <b>lumbar</b> <b>stenosis</b> is decompressed with open laminectomies.

To update our previous systematic review on the diagnostic accuracy of tests used to diagnose <b>lumbar</b> spinal <b>stenosis.</b> Summary of Background Data. A {{wide range of}} clinical, radiological, and electrodiagnostic tests are used to diagnose <b>lumbar</b> spinal <b>stenosis.</b> An accurate diagnosis is vital, because <b>lumbar</b> spinal <b>stenosis</b> may require specific medical advice and treatment. Therefore, {{it is important to}} know the accuracy of these diagnostic tests currently available. Methods. A comprehensive literature search was conducted for original diagnostic studies on <b>lumbar</b> spinal <b>stenosis,</b> in which one or more diagnostic tests were evaluated with a reference standard, and diagnostic accuracy was reported or could be calculated. Our previous systematic review included studies up to March 2004; this review is current up to March 2011. Included studies were assessed for their methodological quality using the QUADAS tool. Study characteristics and reported diagnostic accuracy were extracted. Results. Twenty-two additional articles in addition to the 24 included in the previous review met the inclusion criteria. Combined, this resulted in 20 articles concerning imaging tests, 11 articles evaluating electrodiagnostic tests, and 15 articles evaluating clinical tests. Estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of the tests differed considerably. Conclusion. There is a need for a consensus on criteria to define and classify <b>lumbar</b> spinal <b>stenosis.</b> At present, the most promising imaging test for <b>lumbar</b> spinal <b>stenosis</b> is magnetic resonance imaging, avoiding myelography because of its invasiveness and lack of superior accuracy. Electrodiagnostic studies showed no superior accuracy for conventional electrodiagnostic testing compared with magnetic resonance imaging.

40|$|Abstract: Purpose: The {{surgical}} {{methods of}} degenerative <b>lumbar</b> spinal <b>stenosis</b> include spinal decompression {{with or without}} instrumented or non-instrumented spinal fusion. Previous meta-analysis and systematic reviews have reported the contrast between surgical management and nonsurgical management for degenerative <b>lumbar</b> spinal <b>stenosis,</b> while no literature did among surgical managements. And it is evidenced that whether fusion should be added to spinal decompression in patients of <b>lumbar</b> spinal <b>stenosis</b> is still divisive. So our purpose is to identify whether spinal fusion with or without decompression has a better effect than decompression alone for patients with degenerative <b>lumbar</b> spinal <b>stenosis.</b> Methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for reports before November 2014 and PubMed, EMBASE, GOOGLE SCHOLAR for those before Decem-ber 2014.
