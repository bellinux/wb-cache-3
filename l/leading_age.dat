40|$|Background and objective: {{cardiovascular}} diseases are increased in {{each year in}} India. Cardiovascular diseases more are occurred in the economically productive age group. This will affect their family and also the nation. Aim {{of the study is}} to find out the different types of heart diseases and the case fatality rate of cardiovascular disease from 1 st April 2005 to 31 st March 2010 in a teaching hospital. Materials and Methods: The retrospective study conducted on hospitalized patients admitted with {{cardiovascular diseases}} from 1 st April 2005 to 31 st March 2010. Medical records department follows the guide lines of International Classification of Diseases (ICD) - 10 coding for entering the data, from that data were collected. Results: Of 10427 cases, 6324 (60. 65 %) were males and 4103 (39. 35 %) females. Cardiovascular disease was more among males than females. It was more occurred in ≥ 60 years. Most of them were occurred due to cerebrovascular disease (33. 7 %). Ischemic heart disease was more among males than females. Total number of deaths due to cardiovascular disease was 797. Of them 525 (65. 87 %) were males and 272 (34. 13 %) females. Case fatality due to cardiovascular diseases was 7. 64 %. Case fatality among males (8. 3 %) were more than females (6. 63 %) (P= 0. 00). Conclusion: This study mentioned that most of the cases and deaths were occurred in 60 and above years. Second <b>leading</b> <b>age</b> group is 25 - 59 years. Accident in economically productive people was high. It will affect their family and also the nation. Hence it can be reduced by conducting health awareness programme...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the world}} is in transition, the English {{language}} has taken new forms itself. Everywhere it is at the <b>leading</b> <b>age</b> of technological and scientific development, new thinking in economics and management, new literature and entertainment genres. Nevertheless; the language is, in another way, at a critical moment in this global career. Within a decade or so, {{the number of people who}} speak English as a second language and foreign language will exceed the number of native speakers (Graddol, 2000). There are three kinds of English speakers: those who speak it as a first language, those for whom it is a second language or an additional language, and those who learn it as a foreign language. Native speakers may feel the language ¨belongs to them¨, but those who speak English as a second or foreign language will be the ones who will determine its world future. Since 2004, many international companies have been investing high amounts of money in order to provide many job opportunities. Among all these companies it can be mentioned Sykes that launched its first building in May 2004. Expecting to hire at the end of the year 1, 200 Salvadorian employees no matter the age, constraints, or social status, the only requirements were to have a good technical knowledge (e. g. To type 30 English words per minute on the computer, to know how to search on the internet and handle an e-mail account) and good speaking English skills. (La Prensa Gráfica’s website). In April 13 th 2005, Erick Dithmer, the manager of one of the most powerful companies of the world, Dell, said; “we want to have around 500 hundred employees per story, so we expect the building to be finished by the end of the year”. Claudia Hurtado, a Salvadorian psychologist, suggests that if a person wants to be part of the current labor market, they need to have a well domain of the English language and good computer skills. Due to the brisk globalization, many multinational companies invest on big enterprises and incorporate foreign techniques. Walter Palacios, labor minister of El Salvador has expressed, “There is an important fact; in the last years, the international and local employers have changed the profile of the employees. Now, the facts of being bilingual and knowing how to use computer-tools are not a plus in the curriculum of those who are looking for a job, but at the present time they are a must and a requirement to find a good job...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe propose an {{investigation}} combining numerical and analytical tools {{to estimate the}} ageing viscoelastic properties of cement-based materials within a multiscale framework. With analytical homogenization the properties at the cement paste and mortar scales are estimated {{by a combination of}} Generalized Self-Consistent (GSC) and Mori–Tanaka (MT) schemes. With numerical homogenization the effective properties at the concrete scale are estimated. Numerical homogenization has the advantage of allowing assessing local information and to study more complex geometries. This combined strategy constitutes a promising tool to investigate how different mechanisms <b>leading</b> to <b>ageing</b> at the hydrated products scale, as well as other features of cement-based materials such as the Interfacial Transition Zone (ITZ), affect the viscoelastic behaviour at superior scales. In this context, we study the solidification of non-ageing constituents as the mechanisms <b>leading</b> to the <b>ageing</b> behaviour combined or not with a space-filling process in C–S–H. Relaxation and creep results are presented...|$|R
