40|$|Tropical {{architecture}} of Le Corbusier, {{one of the}} masters of modern architecture, has made immense influences worldwide. This paper tries to rediscover the master architect in terms of inputs he obtained from the context while designing for the Indian subcontinent. The nourishment obtained from the nature {{as well as the}} culture and society helped shape the work of the western architect to a considerable degree. His expressions were modern and his very own, but fitted well with the climate and the society of the place. Daylight and temperature during different times and seasons, monsoon rain, prevailing breeze, immediate and extended landscape, all were considered by the architect with due respect. The paintings, the music and the poetry of the subcontinent helped Le Corbusier to create visual and mental image of the place. A part of the architect's work was influenced from the studies made during his visits to the built environments - urban and rural. He had turned to the sources of local wisdom in devising environment-modifying features for his subcontinental designs. The paper draws upon resources from the doctoral thesis of the author on the environmental performance of buildings designed by Le Corbusier where an in-depth study was made on the environmental features of both <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> <b>buildings</b> and traditional buildings of the subcontinent. It highlights the influences of the traditional strategies in the buildings of the master architect in terms of solutions to climatic problems. References are also made to the factors influencing Le Corbusier's design such as social, cultural and political aspects. Thus the paper helps in getting a fuller understanding of how the works of the modern master from the West were integrated with the total context of climate and culture of the subcontinent...|$|E
50|$|Sights {{include the}} spacious parks and quais with various sculptures {{including}} Jean Tinguely's Heureka, Chinagarten Zürich at Blatterwiese, {{and in the}} northeast the last by <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> designed <b>building,</b> the formerly named Heidi-Weber-Museum respectively Pavillon <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier.</b> On the southeastern side of the delta is the Strandbad Tiefenbrunnen located. The Restaurant Fischstube was built {{as part of the}} Swiss national exhibition 1939, it acclaims to be the only house within the city of Zürich with a thatched roof.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} recent {{experiments on}} 3 D morphing of buildings. A genealogical tree is created out of cross-morphing buildings showing {{their children and}} grandchildren. The resulting children-buildings share characteristics of the formal properties of their parents. There are two methods used here to morph buildings: face-to-face mapping and object-to-object mapping. All morphed buildings are shown as real-time animation. A series of experiments will be presented. Some experiments investigate the implementation of architecture or art theories. For example, how would it look like to morph a Hedjuk <b>building</b> into a <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> <b>building?</b> How would the resulting child look like in a cubist world? Or how would a building look like as it is extrapolated beyond its target and instead of lines and points it is represented as letters and colors? The computer system that {{was developed by the}} author for this paper is called "zhapes" and is a Java-based 3 D-experimentation system. It resides at the address [URL] where it can be downloaded for explorations...|$|R
50|$|The Pavillon <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> is a Swiss {{art museum}} in Zürich-Seefeld at Zürichhorn {{dedicated}} {{to the work of}} the Swiss architect <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier.</b> In 1960 Heidi Weber had the vision to establish a museum designed by <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> - this <b>building</b> should exhibit his works of art in an ideal environment created by the architect himself in the then Centre <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> or Heidi Weber Museum. In April 2014 the building and museum went over to the city of Zürich, and was renamed in May 2016.|$|R
50|$|The Secretariat Building has 39 {{stories and}} was {{completed}} in 1952. The building was designed by the Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer and the Swiss-French architect <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier.</b> This <b>building</b> {{is connected to the}} Conference Building to the north that houses the General Assembly, the Security Council, among others, and a library building to the south. The building houses the administrative functions of the UN, including day-to-day duties such as finance and translation. As part of the UN complex, the building is subject to an agreement between the United Nations and its host country, the United States.|$|R
50|$|The {{limits to}} freedom of {{panorama}} in France have a drastic effect on Wikipedia articles about French architecture. Wikimedia Commons editors routinely delete any images of recent French architecture, despite {{the changes in the}} law. For example, on February 1, 2017 the image of the new Philharmonie de Paris concert hall by architect Jean Nouvel, opened in 2015, was deleted as a violation of freedom of panorama. There is no clear image of the Louis Vuitton Foundation building by Frank Gehry, opened in Paris in 2016; only a poor quality image where the building is unidentifiable, and another where it mostly hidden by trees. There is no image of the <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> Foundation <b>building</b> by French architect <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier,</b> and no clear image of the Centre Pompidou Museum.|$|R
5|$|Professor Johannes Krahn, {{who built}} several churches and early skyscrapers {{such as the}} Beehive House in Frankfurt am Main, {{designed}} a space recalling elements of an early Romanesque Basilica. In a simple shape, a single long nave is concluded by a semicircle choir around the altar. On the right side the wall opens to a side chapel, reminiscent of a transept. The outer walls are sandstone, visible both inside and outside. Light flows in from a band of windows under the plain wooden ceiling. The combination of materials {{has been compared to}} <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier.</b> The <b>building</b> recalls the austere style of sacred architecture of the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|Japan, like Europe, had an {{enormous}} shortage of housing after the war, due to the bombing of many cities. 4.2 million housing units needed to be replaced. Japanese architects combined both traditional and styles and techniques. One of the foremost Japanese modernists was Kunio Maekawa (1905-1986), {{who had worked for}} <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> in Paris until 1930. His own house in Tokyo was an early landmark of Japanese modernism, combining traditional style with ideas he acquired working with <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier.</b> His notable <b>buildings</b> include concert halls in Tokyo and Kyoto and the International House of Japan in Tokyo, all in the pure modernist style.|$|R
50|$|Each {{region of}} Switzerland began to {{incorporate}} local traditional materials and designs into modern houses, apartment buildings, hotels, schools and even industrial buildings. Heimatstil architects included Nicolaus Hartmann in Graubünden, Armin Witmer-Karrer in Zürich, Karl Indermühle in Bern, Alphonse Laverrière in Lausanne und Edmond Fatio in Geneva. In La Chaux-de-Fonds, René Chapallaz and his better known pupil <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> built several <b>buildings</b> that connected Heimatstil and Art Nouveau, including Villa Fallet which was Le Corbusier's first commission.|$|R
40|$|<b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> 2 ̆ 7 s early {{education}} {{encouraged him to}} think of architecture in idealistic and metaphoric terms: architecture not as building, but as representation. Schooled in the neomedieval beliefs of John Ruskin and Owen Jones, and in the organic similes of art nouveau, {{he was convinced that}} art and industry, like art and craft in former times, ought naturally to ally. For <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier,</b> a <b>building</b> was always like something else. His La Chauxde- Fonds houses were like the nature that surrounded them, with their roofs designed as curves and folded gables to echo the shape of local ftr trees. 1 The Salvation Army building was like a beached ocean liner, the Unites like ftling cabinets or wine racks. Continuous ribbon buildings projected for Rio de Janeiro and Algiers were like bridges or aqueducts or even like the Great Wall of China, and the polychrome Nestle Pavilion was like a collage painting into which the viewer could walk...|$|R
5000|$|If the {{skylights}} {{favored by}} Victor Horta are rather absent {{in his work}} (except in his 1910 Mezzara Hotel), Guimard made noteworthy experiments in space and volume. Some of these include the Coilliot House and its disconcerting double-frontage (1898), La Bluette and its beautiful volumetric harmony (1898), and especially the Castel Henriette (1899) and the Castel d’Orgeval (1905), radical demonstrations of a vigorous and asymmetrical [...] "free plan", twenty-five years before the theories of <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier.</b> But other <b>buildings</b> of his, like the splendid Nozal Hotel, (1905), employ a rational, symmetrical, square-based style like that of Viollet-le-Duc.|$|R
50|$|Construction methods {{similar to}} those applied by the {{designers}} of Octopus were employed by renowned architects throughout the world. The buildings created according to those methods include Shukhov Tower (hyperbolic steel gridshell), the famous Philips Pavilion (1958) designed by Iannis Xenakis and <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier,</b> the beautiful <b>buildings</b> constructed by Félix Candela using hyperbolic paraboloid structure, John F. Kennedy (JFK) Airport designed by architect Eero Saarinen, Geodesic Domes by R. Buckminster Fuller, Sydney Opera House by Jorn Utzon, striking constructions by the famous Swiss engineer Heinz Isler, the bus terminal by Eladio Dieste, seaside pavilions by the East German engineer Ulrich Muther and many other well-known buildings.|$|R
5000|$|Modernist {{architects and}} designers, such as Frank Lloyd Wright and <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier,</b> {{believed}} that new technology rendered old styles of <b>building</b> obsolete. <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> thought that <b>buildings</b> should function as [...] "machines for living in", analogous to cars, which {{he saw as}} machines for traveling in. Just as cars had replaced the horse, so modernist design should reject the old styles and structures inherited from Ancient Greece or from the Middle Ages. Following this machine aesthetic, modernist designers typically rejected decorative motifs in design, preferring to emphasize the materials used and pure geometrical forms. The skyscraper is the archetypal modernist building, and the Wainwright Building, a 10-story office building built 1890-91, in St. Louis, Missouri, United States, is among the first skyscrapers in the world. Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's Seagram Building in New York (1956-1958) is often regarded as the pinnacle of this modernist high-rise architecture. Many aspects of modernist design still persist within the mainstream of contemporary architecture, though previous dogmatism {{has given way to}} a more playful use of decoration, historical quotation, and spatial drama.|$|R
25|$|In the 20th century, French-Swiss {{architect}} <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> designed several <b>buildings</b> in France. More recently, French architects {{have combined}} both modern and old architectural styles. The Louvre Pyramid {{is an example}} of modern architecture added to an older building. The most difficult buildings to integrate within French cities are skyscrapers, as they are visible from afar. For instance, in Paris, since 1977, new buildings had to be under 37 meters (121 feet). France's largest financial district is La Defense, where a significant number of skyscrapers are located. Other massive buildings that are a challenge to integrate into their environment are large bridges; an example of the way this has been done is the Millau Viaduct. Some famous modern French architects include Jean Nouvel, Dominique Perrault, Christian de Portzamparc or Paul Andreu.|$|R
500|$|George H. Douglas {{writes that}} the {{building}} [...] "remains {{one of the most}} appealing and awe-inspiring of skyscrapers". Architect <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> called the <b>building</b> [...] "hot jazz in stone and steel". Ada Louise Huxtable, an architectural critic, noted that the building had [...] "a wonderful, decorative, evocative aesthetic", while another architectural critic, Paul Goldberger, notes the [...] "compressed, intense energy" [...] of the lobby, the [...] "magnificent" [...] elevators, and the [...] "magical" [...] view from the crown. The city's Landmarks Preservation Commission says that the tower [...] "embodies the romantic essence of the New York City skyscraper". The travel guide Frommer's gave the building an [...] "exceptional" [...] recommendation, with author Pauline Frommer writing, [...] "In the Chrysler Building we see the roaring-twenties version of what Alan Greenspan called 'irrational exuberance'—a last burst of corporate headquarter building before stocks succumbed to the thudding crash of 1929." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the BBC series, Brand {{is highly}} {{critical}} of the entire modernist approach to architecture. He fully rejects the [...] "center out" [...] approach of design, where a single person or group designs a building for others to use, in favor of an evolutionary approach where owners can change a building over time to meet their needs. He focuses specific criticisms on modernist innovators like Buckminster Fuller for making round buildings that do not allow any kind of additions or internal divisions, Frank Gehry for making buildings that were hard to maintain, and <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier</b> for making <b>buildings</b> that did not take into consideration the needs of families. Brand was also critical of French development during the 1980s which did not take local conditions into account and ended up not serving their purpose, like the central Library which had to take money away from buying new books to deal with the heat produced by so many windows.|$|R
50|$|At the {{northern}} side, along the park, there are mansions and small luxury buildings {{that reflect the}} eclectic architecture of Lyon from the late 19th until the mid-20th century (Napoleon III, Art Nouveau, 1930s styles, <b>Le</b> <b>Corbusier...).</b> Legally, the <b>buildings</b> may not have more than three storeys {{in this part of}} the street. Until No. 63 which is in front of the large tropical greenhouses of the Parc de la Tête d'Or, the odd numbers houses are separated from the park only by a grid and their own garden. These belong to the richest inhabitants of Lyon and only the initials of these people are mentioned on the plaques of doors. There are two yellow stone mansions at No. 33 and two identical buildings paved with marble at No. 35 and 37. In front of the rue Duquesne and the Rue de la Tête d'Or, there are two flags adorned with figures surrendering the green gates with golden lions sculpted that overlook the park. After the Avenue Verguin, a small square, then early 20th-century buildings can be seen.|$|R
