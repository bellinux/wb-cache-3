5|$|A pure browser, the <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu</b> {{feeds on}} foliage from bushes and trees, shoots, twigs, and herbs. Despite {{seasonal}} and local variations, foliage from {{trees and shrubs}} constitute 60–80% of the diet throughout the year. The <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu</b> is mainly active at night and during the dawn, and seeks shelter in dense thickets just after the sunrise. The <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu</b> exhibits no territorial behaviour, and fights are rare. While females are gregarious, adult males prefer being solitary. No fixed breeding season is seen; births may occur {{at any time of}} the year. The <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu</b> inhabits dry, flat, and heavily forested regions.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, {{the genus}} Ammelaphus was {{established}} {{for just the}} <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu</b> by American zoologist Edmund Heller, the type species being A. strepsiceros. However, today the <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu</b> is placed in Tragelaphus instead of Ammelaphus.|$|E
5|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu</b> browses {{primarily}} at dusk or at dawn, and {{is associated with}} the gerenuk and the impala. The <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu</b> and the gerenuk might compete for evergreen species in the dry season. However, unlike the gerenuk, the <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu</b> rarely prefers Acacia species and does not stand on its hindlegs while feeding. The <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu</b> does not have a great requirement for water, and can browse in arid environments. It eats succulent plants, such as the wild sisal, Sansevieria, and Euphorbia species in the dry season, and drinks water when sources are available.|$|E
5|$|The lesser kudu's shyness and {{its ability}} to {{camouflage}} itself in dense cover has protected it from the risks of poaching. For instance, the <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu</b> is widespread in the Ogaden region, which is rich in dense bush, despite reckless hunting by local people. However, rinderpest outbreaks, to which the <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu</b> is highly susceptible, have resulted in a steep decline of 60% in the animal's population in Tsavo National Park in Kenya. Overgrazing, human settlement, and loss of habitat are some other threats to the survival of the <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Sandi Willows-Munro (of the University of KwaZulu-Natal) {{and colleagues}} {{carried out a}} {{mitochondrial}} analysis of the nine Tragelaphus species. mtDNA and nDNA data were compared. The {{results showed that the}} tribe Tragelaphini is monophyletic with the <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu</b> basal in the phylogeny, followed by the nyala (T. angasii). On the basis of mitochondrial data, studies have estimated that the <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu</b> separated from its sister clade around 13.7 million years ago. On the other hand, the nuclear data shows that <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu</b> and nyala form a clade, and collectively separated from the sister clade 13.8 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu</b> has 38 diploid chromosomes. However, unlike {{others in}} the {{subfamily}} Tragelaphinae, the X chromosome and Y chromosome are compound and each is fused with one of two identical autosomes.|$|E
5|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu</b> is gregarious in nature. No {{distinct}} {{leader or}} any hierarchy is {{noted in the}} social structure; with no territorial behavior, fights are uncommon. While fighting, the lesser kudus interlock horns and try pushing one another. Mutual grooming is hardly observed. Unlike most tragelaphines, females can be closely associated for several years. One to three females, along with their offspring, may form a group. Juvenile males leave their mothers when aged a year-and-a-half, and may form pairs. However, {{at the age of}} four to five years, males prefer a solitary lifestyle and avoiding one another, though four or five bulls may share the same home range. <b>Lesser</b> <b>kudu</b> do not usually associate with other animals, except when they feed in the same area.|$|E
5|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu</b> is {{native to}} Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda, but it is extinct in Djibouti. Largely {{confined}} to the Horn of Africa today, the species historically ranged from Awash (Ethiopia) southward through southern and eastern Ethiopia, and most parts of Somalia (except {{the north and the}} northeast) and Kenya (except the southwest). It also occurred in southeastern Sudan and northeastern and eastern parts of Uganda and Tanzania. The only evidence for its existence in the Arabian peninsula is a single set of horns obtained in 1967 from an individual shot in South Yemen and another in Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|Distinct {{signs of}} sexual {{dimorphism}} {{are seen in}} the antelope. The male is considerably larger than the female. The females, as well as juveniles, have a rufous coat, whereas the males become yellowish grey or darker {{after the age of}} two years. The male has a prominent black crest of hair on the neck, but this feature is not well-developed in the female. One long white stripe runs along the back, with 11–14 white stripes branching towards the sides. The chest has a central black stripe, and there is no throat beard. A black stripe runs from each eye to the nose and a white one from each eye to the centre of the dark face. A chevron is present between the eyes. The area around the lips is white, the throat has white patches, and two white spots appear {{on each side of the}} lower jaw. The underparts are completely white, while the slender legs are tawny and have black and white patches. The <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu</b> is characterised by large, rounded ears. Its tracks are similar to the greater kudu's. Females have four teats. The average lifespan is 10 years in the wild, and 15 years in captivity.|$|E
25|$|On September 11, 2011, a <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu</b> {{escaped from}} its {{enclosure}} {{for about half}} an hour and then returned to its enclosure once a zoo worker opened the gate.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} a few studies which supportted {{alternative}} arrangements. One being a sister relationship between the nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus) and spiral-horned antelopes. Historically the nilgai was classified as a tragelaphine by some scientists. Benirschke et al. (1980) work on karyotypes on the <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu</b> found the them {{to share with the}} nilgai in having their X chromosome in a fusion with autosome 14. Another study that analyzed the COII gene found the nilgai and <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu</b> being sister species (although the support was low and had limited species sampling). Majority of other molecular and morphological work do not support the placement of the nilgai in Tragelaphini, as it contradicts with their data and results.|$|E
25|$|At Antelope House {{the species}} present are the addax, babirusa, Banteng, Bactrian camel, gerenuk, Grevy's zebra, Indian muntjac, <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu,</b> {{mountain}} bongo, okapi, reticulated giraffe, Somali wild ass, Speke's gazelle, Sichuan takin, Soemmerring's gazelle, Transcapsian urial, and Visayan warty pig. Non-ungulates {{found in the}} Red Rocks include the marsupials red kangaroo and tammar wallaby, {{as well as several}} birds in mixed-exhibits with the ungulates, such as the ostrich, Stanley crane, and grey crowned crane.|$|E
25|$|Formerly {{known as}} Heart of Africa, {{these are two}} of the park's major exhibits. Visitors go down a trail which {{replicates}} habitats in Africa. The exhibit begins in African Woods with scrub animals - vultures, <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu,</b> and giant eland. It then progresses to forest (okapi, duikers, and wattled cranes). The path then leads to African Outpost, which features plains animals - bontebok, common warthogs, ground hornbills, and cheetahs - against a backdrop of the open-range East Africa exhibit. A central lagoon has lesser and greater flamingos, waterfowl, an island with colobus monkeys, and an interpretive research camp on a separate island.|$|E
25|$|However recent {{molecular}} {{studies have}} shown a different arrangement. According to the molecular work on the nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA, the <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu</b> and the nyala are the basal most living species. Then around 10 million years ago {{there has been a}} split between forest-dwelling, gracile species and larger, open-plains species. This renders Tragelaphus paraphyletic in respect to Taurotragus, which either means to make the latter genus into a junior synonym of the former genus or split Tragelaphus into several genera to maintain Taurotragus. In a 2011 large scale taxonomic study on ungulates by Groves and Grubb, they have found support of cryptic species and should be split into several distinct species. This was based on intensive morphological comparisons between the species (in particular the dimensions of the skull elements and skin colorarion) and defined species based on phylogenetic species concept. Groves and Grubb (2011) furthermore support in the establishment of several new genera in light of Tragelaphus being paraphyletic. Their taxonomy is concurrent with the molecular work, though they have a slight different arrangement among the species in Tragelaphus sensu stricto. Other scientists have mix reactions to this proposal, with some preferring the traditional number of species to be seven and others preferring the new taxonomy from Groves and Grubb (2011).|$|E

500|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu</b> {{is mainly}} active {{at night and}} during the dawn, and seeks shelter in dense {{thickets}} just after the sunrise. It can camouflage so well in such dense vegetation that only its ears and tail can indicate its presence. The midday is spent in rest and rumination in shaded areas. The animal spends about 35% of daytime foraging, 36% standing and lying, and 29% in roaming. As the thinnest tragelaphine, the <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu</b> can move through dense vegetation with ease. The <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu</b> is a shy and wary animal. When alarmed, the animal will stand motionless, confirming any danger. If it senses any approaching predator, it will give out a short sharp bark, similar to the bushbuck's. The <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu</b> would then make multiple leaps of up to [...] height with an upraised tail. If captured by the predator, the victim gives a loud bleat.|$|E
500|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu</b> inhabits dry, flat, {{and heavily}} forested regions. It is closely {{associated}} with Acacia and Commiphora thornbush in semiarid areas of northeastern Africa.

500|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu</b> is Tragelaphus imberbis. The animal is classified under the genus Tragelaphus in family Bovidae. It was first described by the English zoologist Edward Blyth in 1869. The generic name, Tragelaphus, derives from Greek word tragos, meaning a male goat, and elaphos, which means a deer, while the specific name imberbis comes from the Latin term meaning unbearded, referring to this kudu's lack of mane. The vernacular name kudu (or koodoo) could have originated either from the Afrikaans koedoe or the Khoikhoi kudu. The term [...] "lesser" [...] denotes the smaller size of this antelope {{as compared to the}} greater kudu.|$|E
500|$|A pure browser, the <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu</b> {{feeds on}} foliage from bushes and trees, shoots, twigs and herbs. It also eats flowers and fruits if available, and takes small {{proportions}} of grasses, {{usually in the}} wet season. Despite seasonal and local variations, foliage from trees and shrubs constitutes 60-80% of the diet throughout the year. Foliage from creepers and vines (such as Thunbergia guerkeana and some species of Cucurbitaceae and Convulvulaceae) forms 15-25% of the diet in the wet season. Fruits are consumed mainly in the dry season. Olfactory searching, much in the same posture as grazing, is used to find fallen fruits (such as Melia volkensii and Acacia tortilis), while small fruits (such as [...] Commiphora species) are directly plucked from trees. The size and structure of its stomach also suggests its primary dependence on browse.|$|E
2500|$|The {{chromosome}} number of various species varies. This correlates {{nicely with the}} evolutionary relationships among the spiral-horned antelopes. The ancestral Y chromosome was subacrocentric but a pericentric inversion occurred making it submetacentric after {{the separation of the}} <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu</b> and nyala. Ancient hybridization also played a key part {{in the evolution of the}} chromosomes in all species. Below is a listing of the diploid number 2n as follows (male/female): ...|$|E
2500|$|Among the {{varieties}} are the greater and <b>lesser</b> <b>kudu</b> (both rather rare); the duiker, gemsbuck, hartebeest, gerenuk (the most common—it has long thin legs and a camel-like neck); klipspringer, {{found on the}} high plateaus {{as well as in}} the lower districts; and the dik-dik, the smallest of the antelopes, its weight rarely exceeding , common in the low countries and the foothills.
