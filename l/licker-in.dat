50|$|The {{simplest}} machine carder is {{the drum}} carder. Most drum carders are hand-cranked {{but some are}} powered by electric motor. These machines generally have two rollers, or drums, covered with card clothing. The <b>licker-in,</b> or smaller roller meters fibre from the infeed tray onto the larger storage drum. The two rollers are connected to each other by a belt- or chain-drive so that their relative speeds cause the storage drum to gently pull fibres from the <b>licker-in.</b> This pulling straightens the fibres and lays them between the wire pins of the storage drum's card cloth. Fibre is added until the storage drum's card cloth is full. A gap in the card cloth facilitates removal of the batt when the card cloth is full.|$|E
40|$|Carding {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} preparatory processes in the short-staple spinning of yarn from a raw material such as cotton. The main purpose of carding is to individualise fibres thoroughly so that they can be spun into yarns. Therefore, the quality of the yarns spun and the quality of fabrics produced from them is largely determined by the effectiveness of the carding process. The design of the <b>licker-in</b> zone determines the degree of pre-opening, and so plays a major role in determining the carding efficiency. This work investigates and evaluates the influence and effectiveness of <b>licker-in</b> design in determining the quality of carded yarns and the fibre configurations in yarn with the two <b>licker-in</b> designs in use today, viz. the single and triple <b>licker-in</b> designs. Two Indian cotton fibre varieties with widely differing characteristics were processed on a commercial high-production card using the single and triple <b>licker-in</b> systems. The quality of yarns spun revealed that <b>licker-in</b> design indeed has a bearing on fibre, yarn and fabric quality. Test results show that whilst the triple <b>licker-in</b> system demonstrated a relative improvement in the yarn quality when processing the medium staple cotton of average fineness, the single <b>licker-in</b> was observed to be more suitable for the longer and finer variety. The analysis of the fibre configuration in yarns indicates that <b>licker-in</b> designs as well as the processing parameters such as <b>licker-in</b> speed and carding rate have an influence on the fibre configuration. Yarns spun using the material processed through the triple <b>licker-in</b> showed more disorder than those of the single <b>licker-in.</b> Finally, an investigation into the fibre opening at the <b>licker-in</b> using high-speed video photography indicates that the degree of opening and the fibre orientation on the <b>licker-in</b> surface before fibre transfer to the main carding cylinder is different between the two <b>licker-in</b> systems. The degree of opening and fibre orientation were also found to depend on the cotton variety, the production rate and <b>licker-in</b> parameters such as speed.

40|$|Abstract. Effect of {{different}} gauge of pin carding plate and saw-tooth carding plate respectively installed under the <b>licker-in</b> of carding machine on polyester yarn hairiness was studied. The hairiness of polyester yarns {{produced in the}} condition of installing pin carding plate and saw-tooth carding plate under the <b>licker-in</b> at four different gauges were tested by YG 172 yarn hairiness tester. The {{results show that the}} two kinds of carding plate at the gauge of 0. 7 mm are most beneficial to reducing the number of polyester yarn hairiness. When the pin carding plate gauge is 1. 0 mm and the saw-tooth carding plate gauge is 0. 3 mm, the number of polyester yarn hairiness is the most. As a whole, installing saw-tooth carding plate under the <b>licker-in</b> is more favorable for reducing the number of polyester yarn hairiness...|$|E
40|$|Carding is {{the most}} vital process in spinning, which infl uences the sliver quality and the {{resulting}} yarn characteristics. The eff ect of carding on single fibre and bundle fibre properties were studied by employing advanced fibre information system (AFIS) and diff erences in properties are reported. For a good quality yarn, the process parameters and setting in the carding are needed to be selected properly. The paper presents the results due {{to the effect of}} points per square inch (PPSI) in stationary flats of <b>licker-in</b> side (SFL). The effect of setting between the flats and cylinder was also studied. The sample was prepared using LMW spinning line using LC- 333 carding machine. After regulatory changing the PPSI in SFL, the neps in the carded sliver were reduced. The experimentation led to the reductions in the total imperfection in yarn...|$|E
