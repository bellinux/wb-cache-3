5000|$|In a more {{detailed}} review in January 1982, BYTE called the IBM PC [...] "a synthesis of the best the microcomputer industry has offered to date ... as well designed on the inside {{as it is on}} the outside". The magazine praised the keyboard as [...] "bar none, the best ... on any microcomputer", describing the unusual Shift key locations as [...] "minor problems compared to some of the gigantic mistakes made on almost every other microcomputer keyboard". The review also complimented IBM's manuals, which it predicted [...] "will set the standard for all microcomputer documentation in the future. Not only are they well packaged, well organized, and easy to understand, but they are also complete". Observing that detailed technical information was available [...] "much earlier ... than it has been for other machines", the magazine predicted that [...] "given a reasonable period of time, plenty of hardware and software will probably be developed for" [...] the computer. The review stated that although the IBM PC cost more than comparably configured Apple II and TRS-80 computers, and the insufficient number of slots for all desirable expansion cards was its most serious weakness, [...] "you get a <b>lot</b> more <b>for</b> <b>your</b> money" [...] and concluded, [...] "In two years or so, I think it {{will be one of the}} most popular and best-supported ...

40|$|An {{instance}} {{theory of}} attention and memory (ITAM) is presented that integrates formal theories {{of attention and}} memory phenomena by exploiting commonalities in their formal structure. The core idea in each theory is that performance depends on a choice process that can be modeled as a race between competing alternatives. Attention and categorization are viewed as different perspectives on the same race. Attention selects objects by categorizing them; objects are categorized by attending to them. ITAM incorporates each of its ancestors as a special case, so it inherits their successes. Imagine yourself on your way home from work. You walk into the parking <b>lot</b> and look <b>for</b> <b>your</b> car. It takes you a second, perhaps. Now imagine your colleagues analyzing {{the simple act of}} cognition underlying that look. A student of attention would be interested in how your gaze went to the cars rather than other structural features. A student of categorization would be interested in how you knew those were cars in the parking lot. And a student of memory would be interested in how you did (or did not) pick your own car out of the group. These differences in perspectiv...|$|R
