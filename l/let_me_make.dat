500|$|Grey's Anatomy {{has been}} well {{received}} among critics. The show holds an average of 71% positive score on Rotten Tomatoes and 7.7/10 score at IMDB site. The A.V. Club gave an insight on both the overwhelming success and lows {{in the quality of}} the hit medical drama saying, [...] "The quality arc for the show is all over the place, starting with a steady build in the first season, then skyrocketing into phenomenon in season two, then leveling off and dipping in season three, before having some seriously bumpy moments in seasons four (interrupted by the writers’ strike) and five. The climb begins again in season six" [...] Samantha Highfill of Entertainment Weekly in a review wrote, [...] " [...] I believe the show’s best season to date is season 2. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>make</b> it clear that I’m not saying seasons 3 through 9 were bad. In my opinion, there have only been a few lulls in the show’s history, and most of them didn’t last a full season." [...] adding, [...] "I still enjoy the show, and I’ll honestly never stop watching. By any standards, Grey’s Anatomy has been successful television, ranking highly in the ratings for nine seasons and entering the cultural lexicon via phrases as cloying yet catchy as [...] "McDreamy.", the show has had its periods of being intensely irritating, and it has had its periods when it seems as if Shonda Rhimes has taken leave of her faculties, but it’s also got an amazingly high batting average, particularly with every solid season that passes along in this second act of its run." [...] The site lauded the show saying, [...] "On average, it’s been very good TV, filled with interesting, driven characters who run the gamut of professions within the show’s hospital setting. It’s been, by turns, a good soap, a good romantic comedy, a good medical drama, and a good interpersonal show about an unexpected workplace family." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We {{finally got}} this opportunity," [...] said Michael Jaffe. [...] "I had chased the rights {{numerous}} times. One {{of the reasons}} that I never actually tried to make it as a series was that I didn't believe a network would ever let us make it the right way. Then A came along, and Allen Sabinson. I've known him for years and years. He swore he'd <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>make</b> it the right way.|$|E
2500|$|On immigration, Carswell {{appears to}} favour {{moderate}} levels of immigration based on skill and work-capacity. Shortly after joining UKIP, Carswell wrote on his blog: [...] "On {{the subject of}} immigration, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>make</b> it absolutely clear: I'm not against immigration. The one thing more ugly than nativism is angry nativism." [...] He has also said: [...] "We should welcome those that {{want to come here}} to contribute ... There's hardly a hospital, GP surgery or supermarket in the country that could run without that skill and drive." ...|$|E

Then I came to your room that night, I wanted to complain of Mrs. Vostrand for not <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> know about the engagement; and I wasn't man enough to acknowledge that what you said would account for their <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>make</b> a fool of myself. But I believe I am now, and I want to say it." ...|$|R

2500|$|In December 2012, Hart {{embarked}} on a short tour of Ireland with a new lineup, Colm O' Herlihy on guitar, Dan Walsh on drums and Simon Dargan on bass In a recent Facebook Q, Hart commented [...] "I love playing with these guys. They <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>make</b> music rather than getting bogged down administrating a band's business. They make it a joy with their self-starting ways" [...] He confirmed this lineup for his upcoming European and USA dates. Most recently, Hart released the double album The Argument (based on John Milton's Paradise Lost) {{in the summer of}} 2013.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2009, Palin {{threatened}} to sue any media outlet that printed rumors {{that she was being}} investigated by the FBI on corruption charges involving inappropriate contracts. The head of the FBI in Alaska said that she was not being investigated. Some sources have noted however, that the statute of limitations on the contract incident would have passed. She also criticized the media in an op-ed in The Washington Post in which she said [...] "many in the media would rather focus on the personality-driven political gossip of the day than on the gravity of these [...] challenges. So, at risk of disappointing the chattering class, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>make</b> clear what is foremost on my mind and where my focus will be." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} examples of the Band's [...] "grittily distinctive" [...] sound coming together, according to Hoskyns. Its author, Robertson, has explained that it was based on an actual Yazoo Street in a town in Arkansas, Helm's home state: [...] "I thought, 'Wow, they don't have streets like that in Canada. There's no streets up there called Yazoo!' It was like, 'Jesus, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>make</b> up a little story here about stuff going on in this kind of almost red light district.' Everything was lit in red in that song for me." [...] Initially, Robertson recorded the lead vocal for the first version of this song, but because it was set in the South, the Hawks decided that Levon Helm would be a more appropriate singer, employing what Hoskyns describes as his [...] "best redneck-wildcat yelp".|$|E

"The truth is, Brodrick," [...] {{said the}} Carmarthen attorney, with that gleam of triumph {{in his eye}} which had been so often seen there since the will had tumbled out {{of the volume of}} sermons in the book-room, [...] "the whole of this matter has been such a {{pleasure}} to me that I don't care a straw about the costs. If I paid for it all from beginning to end out of my own pocket, I should have had my whack for my money. Perhaps Miss Isabel will recompense <b>me</b> by <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>make</b> her will some day." ...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>make</b> {{one other}} point clear {{for the benefit of}} the {{millions}} in cities who have to buy meats. Last year the Nation suffered a drought of unparalleled intensity. If there had been no Government program, if the old order had obtained in 1933 and 1934, that drought on the cattle ranges of America and in the corn belt would have resulted in the marketing of thin cattle, immature hogs and the death of these animals on the range and on the farm, and if the old order had been in effect those years, we would have had a vastly greater shortage than we face today. Our program – we can prove it – saved the lives of millions of head of livestock. They are still on the range, and other millions of heads are today canned and ready for this country to eat." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band {{expected}} a less personal {{treatment for the}} film and were at times uncomfortable with {{the extent to which}} Guggenheim probed into their history. Responding to the band's concerns, Guggenheim said, [...] "I tell the story that's in front of me, warts and all. In the rock 'n' roll business, it's about adding layers. My process strips layers away. Rock stars are more comfortable creating an aura and mystique." [...] Despite U2's discomfort, they allowed Guggenheim to have creative control over the film. He remarked, [...] "They said from the beginning, we want you to make the movie that you want to make and they <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>make</b> the movie I wanted to make. It was pretty astounding. I think part of it is the trust we gained doing It Might Get Loud, they sort of let me have a free hand." [...] Bono said that it was the least involved the band had ever been in a U2 project. Additional filming took place on 27 May at Burton Cummings Theatre in Winnipeg during the band's rehearsals for the Glastonbury Festival 2011. A rough cut of the movie was shown to the group in July, much to their satisfaction. According to Guggenheim, [...] "They were over the moon. They loved it." [...] The only request the band made was that the film should be shortened in length, and Guggenheim agreed.|$|E
