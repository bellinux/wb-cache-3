5|$|The sixth set of episodes also stayed {{below the}} 4 million mark, {{but in an}} evening that saw ITV beat BBC One's {{audience}} share in the evening by 19.6% to 19%, including the earlier episode of Red of Black? gaining 3.8m viewers, while the later show was viewed by slightly more with 3.9m. However, in direct competition with the later show was BBC One's Would I <b>Lie</b> <b>to</b> <b>You?</b> which had slightly more viewers, with 4m tuning in. On the return of Red or Black? to Saturday night, the show climbed above 4 million {{for the first time}} in three days, to 4.63m for the first show and then up to 5.67m for the second. This enabled ITV to beat BBC One in the primetime ratings overall, by 23.3% to 21%, even though the first episode of series 8 of Strictly Come Dancing was broadcast on BBC. However Red or Black? individually placed behind both Strictly and Doctor Who, with the overnights for the BBC shows being 7.6 and 6.0 million, respectively. Overall through the week the main ITV channel had a higher share of the ratings during primetime than BBC One on five out of the seven occasions, a turnaround from the previous week where it only won on a single evening.|$|E

500|$|Mitchell {{has become}} a regular {{participant}} on many panel shows, leading The Independents James Rampton to christen him [...] "if not king, then certainly prince regent of the panel games."

500|$|During the 2003 Iraq War, {{he started}} touring with the United Service Organizations to {{entertain}} troops overseas while remaining against the war, leading him to once cause a stir at {{a base in}} Kyrgyzstan when he told the crowd: [...] "Your commander would never <b>lie</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> That's the vice president's job." [...] Rollins believes {{it is important that}} he performs to the troops so that they have multiple points of contact with the other parts of the world, stating that [...] "they can get really cut loose from planet earth." [...] He has made eight tours, including visits to bases in Djibouti, Kuwait, Iraq, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan (twice), Egypt, Turkey, Qatar, Honduras, Japan, Korea and the United Arab Emirates.|$|E
500|$|In the hospital, as Buffy {{listens to}} the doctor confirm how Joyce died, the doctor says something, but the words [...] "I have to <b>lie</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> {{to make you feel}} better" [...] are spoken discordantly, as though, {{according}} to cinema scholar Katy Stevens, Buffy [...] "constructs what she believes to be an unmentionable truth—her culpability in her mother's death". In the same scene, Dawn is shot with a hand-held camera that drifts, giving her a slightly unreal moment as she struggles to believe, unlike what Buffy already knows, that her mother's body is down the hall on a steel table. The scene with Buffy and Tara sitting in the waiting room was noted by Rhonda Wilcox for its reality in showing Gellar as ragged and distinctly unglamorous, particularly because she had been presented in a specific way to attract male viewers and was a spokeswoman for Maybelline while Buffy aired. Buffy sits with circles under her eyes, unflattering hair, and slumped posture next to Tara, who had been criticized for being too heavy, despite her body type being more typical of women her age.|$|E
5000|$|Mad editor John Ficarra {{acknowledges}} {{that changes in}} culture have made the task of creating fresh satire more difficult, telling an interviewer, [...] "The editorial mission statement {{has always been the}} same: 'Everyone is <b>lying</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> including magazines. Think for yourself. Question authority.' But it's gotten harder, as they've gotten better at lying and getting in on the joke." ...|$|R

5000|$|Pulitzer Prize-winning art comics maven Art Spiegelman said, [...] "The message Mad had {{in general}} is, 'The media is <b>lying</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> {{and we are}} part of the media.'

[...] William Gaines offered his own view: when asked to cite Mads philosophy, his boisterous answer was, [...] "We must never stop {{reminding}} the reader what little value they get for their money!" ...|$|R
500|$|In September 2007, Gavin Hood, {{director}} of , speculated {{that there would}} be a sequel, which would be set in Japan. During one of the post-credits scenes Logan is seen drinking at a bar in Japan. Such a location was the subject of Chris Claremont and Frank Miller's 1982 limited series on the character, which was not in the first film as Jackman felt [...] "what we need to do is establish who [...] is and find out how he became Wolverine". Jackman stated the Claremont-Miller series is his favorite Wolverine story. Of the Japanese arc, Jackman also stated, [...] "I won’t <b>lie</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> I have been talking to writers... I’m a big fan of the Japanese saga in the comic book." [...] Before X-Men Origins: Wolverines release, Lauren Shuler Donner approached Simon Beaufoy to write the script, but he did not feel confident enough to commit. By May 4, 2009, Jackman's company Seed Productions was preparing several projects, including a sequel to X-Men Origins: Wolverine to be set in Japan, but neither Jackman nor Seed has a production credit on the completed 2013 sequel. On May 5, 2009, just days after the opening weekend of X-Men Origins: Wolverine, the sequel was officially confirmed.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the console}} used 32-bit {{processing}} and {{was capable of}} better graphics and sound than the Genesis alone, most games for the 32X did {{not take advantage of}} its hardware. Doom for the 32X received near perfect reviews from gaming magazines upon launch, but was later noted for being an inferior version of the game compared to releases for the PC and the Atari Jaguar, with the 32X version criticized for missing levels, poor graphic and audio quality, chuggy movement, and running within a window on the screen. Though the system had enhanced audio capabilities, 32X games did not use this, which Franz believes was due to developers being unwilling to invest in designing games to work with the new audio enhancements. [...] One source of these issues was the rush to release games on time for the 32X's launch; former Sega of America executive producer Michael Latham explained, in reference to 32X launch title Cosmic Carnage, [...] "We were rushed. [...] We had to get games out for the 32X and {{it was going to be}} such a close cycle. [...] When Cosmic Carnage showed up, we didn't even want to ship it. [...] It took a lot of convincing, you know, to ship that title." [...] Likewise with Doom, id Software's John Carmack rushed to have the port ready for release at the 32X's launch and had to trim out a third of the game's levels in order to meet the deadline for the port to be published on time. [...] Because of time limitations, game designs were intentionally conservative and did not show what the 32X hardware was able to do. In an interview at the end of 1995, Sega vice president of marketing Mike Ribero, while insisting that Sega was not abandoning the 32X, acknowledged that first party software support for the system had been lackluster: [...] "I won't <b>lie</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> we screwed up with 32X. We overpromised and underdelivered." ...|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} God's promise to Jacob in [...] "The land whereon you <b>lie,</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> will I give it, {{and to your}} seed," [...] caused Jacob to ask Joseph in [...] "Bury me not, I pray, in Egypt." [...] The Midrash taught that God's promise in [...] "The land whereon you <b>lie,</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> will I give it, and to your seed," [...] implied that if Jacob lay in the land, it would be his, but if not, {{it would not be}} his.|$|E

"Yes, that's <b>to</b> steady her. <b>You</b> see, {{when she}} gets into the trough between these great waves, the lower sails are almost becalmed; and we are obliged to show {{something}} above them, to keep a little way on her.

If her head was to fall off a few points, and one of these waves took her on the beam, she would go down like a stone.|$|R

6000|$|... "I have no {{intention}} of <b>lying</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> Nombe, about this or any other matter, though I think that sometimes in the past <b>you</b> have lied <b>to</b> me.

2500|$|In the Homestar Runner cartoons, debuting in the Strong Bad E-Mail [...] "for kids", Homsar (A very unintelligent {{version of}} Homestar) hosts a kids show, [...] "Whaddaya Know, Haddi-Man?" [...] In this show, {{there seems to}} be a [...] "letter of the day". In the episode snippet viewers saw, the letter of the day was [...] "G", which may have come from Sesame Street episodes that were brought to you by a letter of the alphabet. However, Homsar's comment on the letter G was, [...] "I'm not gonna <b>lie</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> that's a healthy piece of real estate!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Reading [...] "Bury me not, I pray, in Egypt", a Midrash {{explained}} that Jacob wanted his bones {{to be carried}} away from Egypt, lest Jacob's descendants remain there, arguing that Egypt must be a holy land, or Jacob {{would not have been}} buried there. The Midrash taught that Jacob also wanted his family quickly to rejoin him in the Land of Israel, as Jacob trusted God to fulfill God's promise in [...] "He shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers." [...] Alternatively, a Midrash taught that Jacob feared that when God afflicted the Egyptians with the Plagues, they would surround Jacob's sepulcher and beseech him to intercede for them. If he did intercede, he would be helping God's enemies. If he did not, he would cause God's Name to be profaned by the Egyptians, who would call Jacob's God inefficacious. Alternatively, a Midrash taught that God promised Jacob in [...] "The land whereon you <b>lie,</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> will I give it, and to your seed," [...] (and this implied) that if Jacob lay in the land, it would be his, but if not, it would not be his.|$|E
2500|$|A {{music video}} {{for the single}} was shot and {{directed}} by Chris Robinson. The president of Young Money Entertainment, Mack Maine, told MTV News, [...] "We're still {{trying to work out}} the date for the next video with [...] and Drake for the 'Moment 4 Life' video. That's the next project." [...] "Moment 4 Life" [...] is the first music video shot in a string of music videos to be released for promotion. In an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Minaj revealed that Roman Zolanski's mother, Martha Zolanski, will make a physical debut in the music video. In an interview with MTV news, Minaj discussed the marriage concept of the music video between her and her label-mate Drake, stating [...] "Obviously, Drake and I, we’ve played around so much with the whole marriage thing and stuff like that, so people have come to be kind of intrigued about us and it’s where we’re shooting the video together. So I was like, {{there has to be some}} sort of romantic storyline. It’s Drake and me." [...] Drake additionally added [...] "I mean, it’s a fantasy video. You’ve got a very regal environment, and you’ve got Nicki doing what she does—big outfits, big everything. Yeah, I love that girl, man. I’m not going to <b>lie</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> The twist of it, the concept of it, I don’t want to give it all away." ...|$|E
