50|$|Hänsch {{introduced}} intracavity {{telescopic beam}} expansion to grating tuned <b>laser</b> <b>oscillators</b> thus producing the first narrow-linewidth tunable laser. This {{development has been}} credited with having had a major influence {{in the development of}} further narrow-linewidth multiple-prism grating <b>laser</b> <b>oscillators.</b> In turn, tunable narrow-linewidth organic lasers, and solid-state lasers, using total illumination of the grating, have had a major impact in laser spectroscopy.|$|R
5000|$|Multiple-prism grating <b>laser</b> <b>oscillators,</b> or MPG <b>laser</b> <b>oscillators,</b> use multiple-prism beam {{expansion}} {{to illuminate}} a diffraction grating mounted either in Littrow configuration or grazing-incidence configuration. Originally, these narrow-linewidth tunable dispersive oscillators were introduced as multiple-prism Littrow (MPL) grating oscillators, or hybrid multiple-prism near-grazing-incidence (HMPGI) grating cavities, in organic dye lasers. However, these designs were quickly adopted for {{other types of}} lasers such as gas lasers, diode lasers, and more recently fiber lasers.|$|R
5000|$|This {{improved}} {{gain medium}} {{was central to}} the demonstration of the first tunable narrow-linewidth solid-state dye <b>laser</b> <b>oscillators,</b> by Duarte, which were later optimized to deliver pulse emission in the kW regime in nearly diffraction limited beams with single-longitudinal-mode laser linewidths of [...] ≈ 350 MHz (or [...] ≈ 0.0004 nm, at a laser wavelength of 590 nm). [...] These tunable <b>laser</b> <b>oscillators</b> use multiple-prism grating architectures yielding very high intracavity dispersions that can be nicely quantified using the multiple-prism grating equations.|$|R

5000|$|From {{the mid-1980s}} to early 1990s Duarte and {{scientists}} from the USArmy Missile Command developed ruggedized narrow-linewidth <b>laser</b> <b>oscillators</b> tunable directly in the visible spectrum. [...] This constituted the first disclosure, in the open literature, of a tunable narrow-linewidth laser tested on a rugged terrain. This research led to experimentation with polymer gain media and in 1994 Duarte reported on the first narrow-linewidth tunable solid state dye <b>laser</b> <b>oscillators.</b> [...] These dispersive oscillator architectures were then refined to yield single-longitudinal-mode emission limited only by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.|$|R
40|$|Under some conditions, {{spontaneous}} coherent pulsations {{are known}} {{to occur in the}} output beams of inhomogeneously broadened <b>laser</b> <b>oscillators.</b> These <b>lasers</b> typically operate with a Gaussian transverse field distribution, while the corresponding theoretical models assume a uniform-plane-wave field. The effects of a Gaussian field on the stability criteria of single-mode inhomogeneously broadened ring <b>laser</b> <b>oscillators</b> are considered in this study. It is found that in comparison to a plane wave a Gaussian field variation still permits low-threshold spontaneous pulsations but reduces the parameter space over which these pulsations can be observed...|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} {{criteria for}} single-mode standing-wave <b>laser</b> <b>oscillators</b> in the homogeneously broadened limit are reported, and {{two types of}} criteria are distinguished. The first type (type 1) corresponds to the minimum value of the threshold parameter for which an infinitesimal perturbation away from steady state grows into an oscillatory solution. A second type (type 2) corresponds to the minimum value of threshold parameter for which large-amplitude oscillations do not decay to the steady-state solution. Undamped pulsations in single-mode homogeneously broadened standing-wave <b>laser</b> <b>oscillators</b> are found to occur {{at a much higher}} excitation level than in ring-laser oscillators with homogeneous broadening. The effects of detuning on the stability criteria are also investigated...|$|R

40|$|The {{dependence}} of the beam quality of tapered <b>laser</b> <b>oscillators</b> and amplifiers on the modal optical gain is demonstrated experimentally and theoretically for the first time. Tapered devices with high-(HMG) and low-modal gain (LMG) structures are compared in terms of output power and beam quality. At high-output powers the beam quality of LMG devices is {{by a factor of}} ten better than the beam quality of high-modal gain devices. The beam quality remains nearly unchanged up to power levels of more than 2 -W continuous-wave (CW) where a beam quality factor of M(2) < 3 is achieved for both, tapered <b>laser</b> <b>oscillators</b> and tapered amplifiers...|$|R

In this paper we review {{the achievements of}} mode-locked thin disk lasers in terms of average power and pulse energy. Stable mode locking requires single transverse mode operation even at the highest average power, which is challenging and therefore addressed in more detail.

50|$|Following {{his arrival}} to Macquarie University {{in the late}} 1970s, from Oxford, Piper {{established}} {{one of the first}} laser research centres in Australia. Initially he directed his research towardgas lasers, continuous wave metal ion lasers, cyclic pulsed metal vapour lasers, and metal ion recombination lasers. He also added a laser development program on high-power tunable dye lasers for various applications including atomic vapor laser isotope separation. In this area of research he is co-author, with Frank Duarte, of a number of papers on tunable <b>laser</b> <b>oscillator</b> physics.|$|E
5000|$|The tunable narrow-linewidth <b>laser</b> <b>oscillator</b> configurations, {{introduced}} by Duarte and Piper, were adopted by various research groups working on uranium atomic vapor laser isotope separation (AVLIS). [...] This work {{was supported by}} the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. During the course of this research, Duarte writes that he did approach the then federal minister for energy, Sir John Carrick, to advocate for the introduction of an AVLIS facility in Australia. In 2002, he participated in research that led to the isotope separation of lithium using narrow-linewidth tunable diode lasers.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} type of laser uses {{feedback}} from an optical cavity—a pair of mirrors on either end of the gain medium. Light bounces {{back and forth between the}} mirrors, passing through the gain medium and being amplified each time. Typically one of the two mirrors, the output coupler, is partially transparent. Some of the light escapes through this mirror. Depending on the design of the cavity (whether the mirrors are flat or curved), the light coming out of the laser may spread out or form a narrow beam. In analogy to electronic oscillators, this device is sometimes called a <b>laser</b> <b>oscillator.</b>|$|E

50|$|Organic lasers are {{inherently}} tunable and when configured as optimized multiple-prism grating <b>laser</b> <b>oscillators</b> can yield efficient single-transverse mode, and single-longitudinal-mode, emission with laser linewidths as narrow as 350 MHz (approximately 0.0004 nm at a wavelength of 590 nm), in the high-power pulsed regime.|$|R
40|$|High power InGaAs/GaAs tapered <b>laser</b> <b>oscillators</b> with a {{new type}} of carbon doping in the p-cladding layers grown by MBE are presented. In these devices carbon {{partially}} replaces the common beryllium p-dopant near the core region. SIMS depth profiles show, that the carbon doped layer serves as an efficient diffusion barrier for the beryllium in the p-cladding and contact layers. Thus, the previously observed severe beryllium redistribution from the p-cladding layer into the core region of the laser diodes is completely suppressed. In single quantum well (WQW) lasers this doping profile results in low internal losses of 2. 6 cm(exp - 1).

50|$|The {{gain medium}} of a laser is {{normally}} a material of controlled purity, size, concentration, and shape, which amplifies the beam {{by the process}} of stimulated emission described above. This material can be of any state: gas, liquid, solid, or plasma. The gain medium absorbs pump energy, which raises some electrons into higher-energy ("excited") quantum states. Particles can interact with light by either absorbing or emitting photons. Emission can be spontaneous or stimulated. In the latter case, the photon is emitted {{in the same direction as}} the light that is passing by. When the number of particles in one excited state exceeds the number of particles in some lower-energy state, population inversion is achieved and the amount of stimulated emission due to light that passes through is larger than the amount of absorption. Hence, the light is amplified. By itself, this makes an optical amplifier. When an optical amplifier is placed inside a resonant optical cavity, one obtains a <b>laser</b> <b>oscillator.</b>|$|E
50|$|Research {{in nuclear}} pumped lasers {{started in the}} early 1970s when {{researchers}} were unable to produce a laser with a wavelength shorter than 110 nm with the end goal of creating an x-ray laser. When laser wavelengths become that short the laser requires {{a huge amount of}} energy which must also be delivered in an extremely short period of time. In 1975 it was estimated, by George Chapline and Lowell Wood from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, that “pumping a 10-keV (0.12-nm) laser would require around a watt per atom” in a pulse that was “10−15 seconds x the square of the wavelength in angstroms.” As this problem was unsolvable with the materials at hand and a <b>laser</b> <b>oscillator</b> was not working, research moved to creating pumps that used excited plasma. Early attempts used high-powered lasers to excite the plasma to create an even more highly powered laser. Results using this method were unsatisfying, and fell short of the goal. Livermore scientists first suggested using a nuclear reaction as a power source in 1975. By 1980 Livermore considered both nuclear bombs and nuclear reactors as viable energy sources for an x-ray laser. On November 14, 1980, the first successful test of the bomb-powered x-ray laser was conducted. The use of a bomb was initially supported over that of the reactor driven laser because it delivered a more intense beam. Livermore’s research was almost entirely devoted to missile defense using x-ray lasers. The idea was to mount a system of nuclear bombs in space where these bombs would each power approximately 50 lasers. Upon detonation these lasers would fire and theoretically destroy several dozen incoming nuclear missiles at once. Opponents of this plan found many faults in such an approach and questioned aspects such as the power, range, accuracy, politics, and cost of such deployments. In 1985 a test titled ‘Goldstone’ revealed the delivered power to be less than believed. Efforts to focus the laser also failed.|$|E

50|$|In {{the case}} of {{amplification}} of optical signals, the lasing frequency is called signal frequency.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{a method that}} enables accurate timing jitter spectral density characterization of free-running mode-locked <b>laser</b> <b>oscillators</b> over more than 10 -decade of Fourier frequency from mHz to tens MHz range. The method is based on analyzing both the input voltage noise to the slave laser and the output voltage noise from the balanced optical cross- correlator (BOC), when two mode-locked lasers are synchronized in repetition rate by the BOC. As a demonstration experiment, timing jitter spectrum of a free-running mode-locked Er-fiber laser with a dynamic range of > 340 dB is measured over Fourier frequency ranging from 1 mHz to 38. 5 MHz (Nyquist frequency). The demonstrated method can resolve different noise mechanisms that cause specific jitter characteristics in free-running mode-locked <b>laser</b> <b>oscillators</b> for a vast range of time scales from 1000 -s.
