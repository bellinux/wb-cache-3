In all 99 accessions belonging to 51 taxa were sampled from 29 collecting sites. Rare crops for Italy were found e. g. Citron melon [Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. et Nakai subsp. lanatus var. citroides (Bailey) Mansf. ex Greb. ], old landraces of root chicory (Cichorium intybus L.), Artemisia umbelliformis La. cultivated, ancient populations of rye selected for straw, rutabaga (Brassica napus L. var. napobrassica [L. ] Rchb.), 'bleu potatoes' (Solanum sp.), etc. In conclusion the Occitans and Ladin <b>linguistic</b> <b>islands</b> still conserve worthy crop genetic resources but similar to other Italian regions inhabited by ethnic minorities, the traditional customs and language are losing importnace. This phenomenon also negatively affects the cultivation of landraces causing their genetic erosion and, in many cases, extinction.

40|$|Studying groups {{subject to}} {{barriers}} to gene flow provides {{a unique opportunity}} to understand how inbreeding, genetic drift and selection have shaped the structure of human genetic diversity. Currently, the consequences of genetic isolation may be better studied using genome wide approaches (GWA), such as those based on SNP microarrays which enable the simultaneous analysis of very large numbers of loci distributed across chromosomes. Despite the considerable body of knowledge on human genetic isolates, variation occurring among individuals within isolated populations has not been yet thoroughly investigated. This issue is worth exploring since events of recent admixture and presence of sub-structure could potentially disrupt the genetic homogeneity which is expected when isolation is prolonged and constant over time. In a previous study, we have compared intra and inter- population variation measures combining novel and literature data relative to 87, 818 autosomal SNPs in 14 open populations and 10 geographic and/or linguistic European isolates. Here, we expand our dataset to a total of 27 groups and move our focus to the variation among individual genomes within populations. Using four measures of within population diversity (homozygosity, identity-by-state and length and number of runs of homozygosity), we observed a significantly higher level of variation among the German-speakers of the <b>linguistic</b> <b>islands</b> of Sappada, Sauris and Timau and North Sardinians.

50|$|Due to its {{strategic}} {{position on the}} Mediterranean Sea, Alghero had been developed into a fortified port town by 1102, built by the Genoese Doria family. The Dorias ruled Alghero for centuries, apart from a brief period {{under the rule of}} Pisa between 1283-84. Algheros population later grew because of the arrival of Catalan colonists. In the early 16th century Alghero received papal recognition as a bishopric and the status of Kings City (ciutat de lAlguer) and developed economically.Historically, the city was founded in the early twelfth century between 1102 and 1112, when the noble Doria family of Genoa was allowed to build the first historical nucleus into an empty section of the coast of the parish of Nulauro in Judicature of Torres (Sassari). For two centuries remained in the orbit of the Maritime Republics, first and foremost the Genoese apart from 1283-1284 when the Pisans were able to control it for a year. It is plausible that at this time the town shared, given its commercial and multi-ethnic nature, a language similar to the nascent Sassarese. The village was conquered by force by the Crown of Aragon, at the behest of Peter IV dAragona, who later actively promoted colonisation of the town and the surrounding area, sending numerous families from different counties and provinces of the then Crown of Aragon, including Valencia, Majorca, Catalonia and Aragon. These were granted enticing privileges, and in fact replaced the original population some of whom were sent to the Iberian Peninsula and Majorca as slaves. The dialects these families spoke in Alghero, were all very similar and derived from the same linguistic family. Over time it settled on its current form of Catalan, despite the subsequent decline of the Crown of Aragon. Alghero today is struggling to retain the use of Catalan, which is a <b>linguistic</b> <b>island</b> and only 10-15% of its inhabitants speak it in its Alghero variant. The language is recognized by both the Italian Republic and Sardinia as a minority language. Nowadays it is poorly spoken by young people. The city is trying for some time to protect this dialect, through education programs and official use within the local authority. The citizens currently residing in Alghero however, are mostly from the surrounding territories and prefer either the Italian language or Sardinian and Sassarese. Alghero still maintains a small representation at the Generalitat de Catalunya (the autonomous government of Catalonia), without actually having any institutional power in the territory apart from providing assistance to the preservation of Catalan culture. The city, one of the principal of Sardinia and the fifth most populated region, is one of the gateways to the Island thanks to the nearby airport. It is the capital of the Riviera del Corallo, whose name derives from the fact that its waters provide an abundant supply of precious red coral of the finest quality. Historically the processing and sale of the material has been of great importance to the economy and a branch of coral is inserted in the emblem of the city.|$|E

These factors can shape their genetic makeup both at the individual and population level. However, {{is it possible to}} identify patterns relating genomic diversity and demographic history? To answer this question we analyzed approximately 90, 000 autosomal ancestry informative markers (AIMs) as part of the Genochip (National Geographic Society, Washington, DC & Family Tree DNA, Houston, Texas, USA) in eight Italian populations, all subject to geographic and/or cultural isolation factors. Four were from Sardinia (old and large isolates) and as many from the eastern Alps (young and small isolates). The same panel of AIMs was analyze d in literature data relative to both open and isolated European groups, for a total of 24 populations. Alpine isolates (German-speaking <b>linguistic</b> <b>islands</b> of Sappada, Sauris and Timau) showed stronger signals of genetic isolation [i. e. frequency and size of Runs of Homozygosity, LD decay and intra-group distributions of Identity by State (IBS) ] than older and larger groups (Sardinians, Basques and Orcadians). Rather unexpectedly, the ADMIXTURE and PCA analyses, as well as the comparison of intra-group IBS distributions, highlighted a noticeable genetic heterogeneity within Sappada, Sauris and Timau, likely due to relatively recent admixture events. This pattern, undetected in any other population sample, is at odds with the conventional view of a substantial genetic homogeneity within population isolates.

40|$|The {{identification}} of isolation signatures {{is fundamental to}} better understand the genetic structure of human populations and to test the relations between cultural factors and genetic variation. In contrast to the methodological advancements achieved in the study of isolation in natural populations, current approaches in human population genetics are based on the evaluation of within and among-group diversity, but it remains difficult to distinguish between the effects of reduced sample size, purifying selection and differential admixture and the consequences of long-term isolation. To overcome these limitations, we have integrated the analysis of classical genetic diversity measures with a Bayesian method to estimate gene flow and have carried out simulations based on the coalescent with the aim to test whether a short history of cultural and geographical isolation may have left detectable genetic signatures in some Italian populations. The investigation has been primarily conducted using mitochondrial and Y chromosome polymorphisms, that continue to represent today important tools to study human isolates. The research has been conducted in Italy {{due to the fact that}} its history of migrations has determined a degree of ethno-cultural heterogeneity of the most complex in the European continent. However, all these migration events explain at least part of the genetic structure of extant Italian populations, the understanding of which needs to take into account the important component of the historic ethno-linguistic minorities, most of them are concentrated within the Alpine environment. This study has been first focused on the analysis of the genetic structure of four <b>linguistic</b> <b>islands</b> of the Eastern Italian Alps (Lessinia, Sappada, Sauris and Timau) integrated with the estimation of incoming and outgoing gene flow under an isolation with migration model using mitochondrial DNA data between the populations that show robust signatures of isolation and a neighbor or a Central Western European population. The study has been extended by the investigation of high resolution data on Y chromosomal variation in three distinct Alpine ethno-linguistic groups (Italian, Ladin and German), in order to understand how their genetic diversity is patterned. Combining unilinear polymorphisms, we used coalescent simulation to test the role of effective size and gene flow in determining their genetic diversity. We extended the dataset with numerous Italian populations in order to evaluate the association of linguistic and geographic factors with genetic isolation. Furthermore, a comparison of the extent of genetic diversity observed in Italy and Europe were performed taking into account both open populations and geographically and/or linguistically isolated groups. Finally, we tested the usefulness of a panel of 15 autosomal microsatellite loci usually used in forensic genetics to understand the effects of physical barriers and linguistic diversity on the genetic structure of Alpine populations. The comparison between mitochondrial, Y chromosomal and autosomal patterns of variation observed suggests that not only geographic factors and linguistic diversity, but also socially aspects (e. g. residence rules, marital behaviours, inheritance and succession systems) should be taken into account when studying the genetic structure of Alpine populations. 	 From an anthropological point of view, this research highlights the important contribution of the so called “linguistic islands” (e. g. German speaking groups of Sappada and Luserna from the Eastern Italian Alps) to the genetic diversity of Italy. Notably, the aims of this project have not been limited to scientific outputs, having also included the development of a community-based participatory research protocol, which also takes into account the importance of the return of scientific results to the involved communities...|$|R
