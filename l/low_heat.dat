Malawach is a thin circle of dough toasted in a frying pan. Kubaneh is a yeast dough baked overnight and traditionally served on Shabbat morning. Lahoh is a spongy, pancake-like bread made of fermented flour and water, and fried in a pan. Jews from Ethiopia make a similar bread called injera from millet flour.|$|E

40|$|Stainless steel powders (303 L, 304 L, 310 L and 316 L) {{were formed}} into tensile test bars using the “press and sinter” process. Most {{processing}} parameters, except heating rate, were kept constant. During the heating {{of the experimental}} speci-mens from 700 °C to the sintering temperature of 1300 °C, heating rates were varied, e. g., 2. 5, 5. 0, and 10. 0 °C/min. Experimental results showed that a material <b>heated</b> with a <b>low</b> <b>heating</b> rate tended to have higher sintered density and tensile strength. However, the <b>low</b> <b>heating</b> rate caused grain growth in the sintered material. These results are in contradiction with the improved densification of some ceramics by ultra rapid heating. The reasons for contradiction are as follows. First, the heat-ing rates employed in this work are not very different. The second is attributed to small thermal gradients generated in the thin metal powder compacts. Because of these reasons, densification of the sintered stainless steels series 300 is controlled by an isothermal condition. The <b>low</b> <b>heating</b> rate allows longer time for atomic diffusion, which is an important sintering factor. This means more atoms move to points of contact between powder particles to form necking and to cause necking growth. This results in better sintering. However, the <b>low</b> <b>heating</b> rate means that the materials are exposed to heat for longer time and thus their grains {{have a tendency to}} grow...|$|R

30|$|Pyrolysis is an {{advanced}} thermal treatment that converts a material into a syngas at temperatures around 1000 °C {{and in the}} absence of oxygen. Pyrolysis also can be described as the direct thermal decomposition of the organic matrix that could obtain solid, liquid and gas products [35 – 37]. Temperature is the most important factor for the product distribution of pyrolysis, most interesting range for the production of the pyrolysis products is between 625 and 775  K. The charcoal yield decreases as the temperature increases. Yield of products resulting from biomass pyrolysis can be maximized as follows: charcoal (a <b>low</b> temperature, <b>low</b> <b>heating</b> rate process), liquid products (a <b>low</b> temperature, high <b>heating</b> rate, short gas residence time process), and fuel gas (a high temperature, <b>low</b> <b>heating</b> rate, long gas residence time process) [8, 38, 39].|$|R

25|$|UV {{disinfection}} is {{most effective}} for treating high-clarity, purified reverse osmosis distilled water. Suspended particles are a problem because microorganisms buried within particles are shielded from the UV light and pass through the unit unaffected. However, UV systems can be coupled with a pre-filter to remove those larger organisms that would otherwise pass through the UV system unaffected. The pre-filter also clarifies the water to improve light transmittance and therefore UV dose throughout the entire water column. Another key factor of UV water treatment is the flow rate—if the flow is too high, water will pass through without sufficient UV exposure. If the flow is too <b>low,</b> <b>heat</b> may build up and damage the UV lamp.|$|E

25|$|Type IV Portland cement is {{generally}} {{known for its}} <b>low</b> <b>heat</b> of hydration. Its typical compound composition is: 28% (C3S), 49% (C2S), 4% (C3A), 12% (C4AF), 1.8% MgO, 1.9% (SO3), 0.9% ignition loss, and 0.8% free CaO. The percentages of (C2S) and (C4AF) are relatively high and (C3S) and (C3A) are relatively low. A limitation on this type is that the maximum percentage of (C3A) is seven, and the maximum percentage of (C3S) is thirty-five. This causes the heat given off by the hydration reaction to develop at a slower rate. However, as a consequence {{the strength of the}} concrete develops slowly. After one or two years the strength is higher than the other types after full curing. This cement is used for very large concrete structures, such as dams, which have a low surface to volume ratio. This type of cement {{is generally}} not stocked by manufacturers, but some might consider a large special order. This type of cement has not been made for many years, because Portland-pozzolan cements and ground granulated blast furnace slag addition offer a cheaper and more reliable alternative.|$|E
500|$|The {{level of}} heat input also affects weld quality.

If {{there is too much}} heat input, however, the weld bead grows in width while the likelihood of excessive penetration and spatter increase. Additionally, if the welding torch is too far from the workpiece the shielding gas becomes ineffective, causing porosity within the weld. This results in a weld with pinholes, which is weaker than a typical weld.|$|E
500|$|The surface {{heat flow}} anomaly around the Hawaiian Swell is {{only of the}} order of 10mW/m2, far less than the {{continental}} United States range of 25 to 150mW/m2. This is unexpected for the classic model of a hot, buoyant plume in the mantle. However, {{it has been shown that}} other plumes display highly variable surface heat fluxes and that this variability may be due to variable hydrothermal fluid flow in the Earth's crust above the hotspots. This fluid flow advectively removes heat from the crust, and the measured conductive heat flow is therefore lower than the true total surface heat flux. The <b>low</b> <b>heat</b> across the Hawaiian Swell indicates that it is not supported by a buoyant crust or upper lithosphere, but is rather propped up by the upwelling hot (and therefore less-dense) mantle plume that causes the surface to rise through a mechanism known as [...] "dynamic topography".|$|E

Child labor was common in the industry: until well into the nineteenth century children eight years old and younger worked 16 hours per day, and children four years old stacked and carried bricks for hours at a stretch.
