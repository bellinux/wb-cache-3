5000|$|A [...] "liner train", or [...] "freightliner", is a UK {{term for}} a train {{carrying}} intermodal containers.

50|$|However, the {{construction}} of the yard was opposed by Gerry Fiennes, appointed BR Chief Operating Officer in 1961, on the basis that it was not justified either {{from the point of view}} of existing or potential traffic or as a means of handling the traffic that there was. He effectively put an end to the plans by refusing to send any East Coast Main Line traffic there. At the time, the need for marshalling yards was in question as the movement of goods traffic by the wagonload was gradually being rationalised in favour of the <b>liner</b> <b>train</b> system which would not require the extensive storage facilities provided by marshalling yards. Horwood House, which had been purchased at a cost of £30,000, was subsequently given over to the General Post Office. The old station is to be demolished as part of the EWR western section.

30|$|A {{small-scale}} intermodal {{freight train}} {{system has been}} implemented in Switzerland. Innovatrain - a <b>liner</b> <b>train</b> with stops at many terminals over short distances - is a push‐pull train capable of operating in either direction [21]. It can either run on the electrical main track, at speeds up to 120  km/h, or drive into a private railway siding by using its diesel power. For horizontal transhipment, the ContainerMover system is used, between the train and the truck. The device is mounted on the truck, which makes transhipment possible at every terminal, or small terminal/ siding. Another system for horizontal transfer of unit loads is the CarConTrain (CCT), consisting of a wagon that travels parallel with the track, equipped with arms for transferring freight horizontally [28]. The system can transfer unit loads fitted with corner castings from 2.5 to 3.6 metres wide and 3 to 12 metres long. Since it can be fully automated, {{it could be used}} in unmanned terminals and warehouses. The train can be unloaded regardless of whether the truck is available and can arrive at any time, since no personnel are required. The terminal cost can be reduced and thus the cost of the overall transport chain.|$|E
40|$|The global {{trend of}} {{urbanization}} is evident and also valid in Sweden {{and for the}} Stockholm-Mälaren region, {{also referred to as}} the Mälaren valley, a region consisting of metropolitan Stockholm and areas around the lake of Mälaren. In this context, efficient urban freight transportation has emerged as essential for sustainable development of urban areas. Geographic regions are being expanded {{due to the fact that}} rapid transport options have expanded the range of action of people and businesses. Metropolitan regions require freight transports that are often categorized by an inflow of consumables and an outflow of waste and recyclable material. Within urban areas there are ports, terminals and storage facilities that require incoming and outgoing transport. Altogether, these shipments have led to increased congestion on the road network within urban areas, which is a contributing factor to why a shift to intermodal land transports have been advocated both in Europe and in Sweden, thus encouraging more freight to be moved from road to rail. Another contributing factor is the relatively low impact on the environment generated by rail transportation. Efficient use of resources and low emissions of greenhouse gases are factors that are in favor of the train as a transport mode. Furthermore, conventional rail freight is commonly competitive on long distances and in end-point relations between two nodes. However, an intermodal <b>liner</b> <b>train,</b> as a transport system for freight differs from conventional rail freight transport systems, as it similar to a passenger train makes stops along the route for loading and unloading. Due to the stops made at intermediate stations it enables the coverage of a larger market area. For regional or inter-regional relations, the concept has the potential of reducing drayage by truck to and from intermodal terminals and to make rail freight competitive also over medium and short distances. The main aim of this thesis project has been to analyze under which conditions a combined transport system with the railway as a base can be implemented in the Stockholm-Mälaren region. Based on a case study for a shipper distributing daily consumables in the region, the feasibility of creating a regional rail freight transport system has been evaluated. This study provides a methodology for evaluating the feasibility, regarding costs and emissions, of concepts and technologies within freight transportation chains. This has been accomplished by the development of a cost modal, Intermodal Transport Cost Model (ITCM). From the results of the case study one can conclude that a regional rail based intermodal transport system regarding costs is on the threshold of feasibility in the studied region. As for emissions, all evaluated intermodal transport chains contribute to a significant decrease in CO 2 emissions compared to unimodal road haulage. The loading space utilization of the train and the transshipment cost are the most critical parameters. The latter restricting the competitiveness of intermodal services to long distances as it is not proportional to transported distance but rather to the utilization rate of resources. Hence, the concept of cost-efficient small scale (CESS) terminals is introduced in this study. A main prerequisite in order to make the intermodal <b>liner</b> <b>train</b> efficient is a stable and balanced flow of goods with optimized loading space utilization along the route. As the objective is to consolidate small flows, imbalances along the route will constitute an obstacle for the <b>liner</b> <b>train</b> to be competitive. Thus regarding loading space utilization it is necessary to consolidate other freight flows in the train in order to achieve high loading space utilization and a balanced flow along the route. The third parameter which is critical for the results are the fuel prices, where a sensitivity analysis of the results shows that if diesel prices would increase so would the feasibility of the intermodal option. The same is also valid for train length increase as long as the loading space utilization is maintained. The results of the feasibility study indicate that the evaluated transshipment technologies are closing the gap for intermodal transport to unimodal road haulage regarding transport cost over short- and medium distances and that they contribute to a substantial reduction of CO 2 emissions. However, it is essential that also the transport quality is ensured, especially regarding reliability and punctuality. Thus a demonstration project is recommended as these aspects require operational testing. This is particularly crucial regarding novel transshipment technologies.   QC 20130530 Regional kombitransportsystem i Mälardale...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, {{intermodal}} transport has a medium to high market share for large flows over long distances while {{the short and}} medium distances (less than 500 km) mainly remain a domain of the road transport sector. In order to allow {{intermodal transport}} {{to compete in the}} medium distance and high quality market segment, alternative network operations that allow for an intensification of rail services and expansion of geographical coverage are needed. Intermodal liner trains that operate in corridor network designs with intermediate stops between start and end terminals are regularly advocated by intermodal transport researchers as a means to compete with all-road transport on small volumes and short distance markets. Innovative transhipment technologies facilitating fast and efficient transhipments are a necessity for intermodal liner trains since the conventional terminals are not appropriate for intermediate terminals where freight volumes are low and train dwelling times need to be short. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyse the transhipment unit cost’s effect on the modal shift potential of intermodal liner trains based on fast and efficient transhipments. In a theoretical case study the cost and potential modal share for an intermodal <b>liner</b> <b>train</b> on a corridor in Sweden is analysed. The method is based on modelling a competitive situation between traditional road transport and intermodal road-rail transport. The results confirm that in theory intermodal liner trains can provide competitive services on short and medium transport distances in case transhipment costs are kept low. Fast and efficient transhipment technologies can open business opportunities for operators and cost savings potential for shippers in a market segment which is dominated by road transport...|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{intermodal}} {{rail freight}} transport systems have proved themselves competitive and able to offer cost-leadership on long distances and in endpoint relations between two nodes. Several studies within intermodal transports have made contributions in finding the minimum distance, the “break-even” distance that an intermodal door-to-door shipment can compete with unimodal road. The results for European conditions {{are found in the}} range 300 - 800 km. The main aim of this doctoral thesis has been to analyse under which conditions a short haul transport system with the railway as a base can be considered a feasible solution. This has been conducted within the framework of two research projects. In the main research project of this thesis; REGCOMB (Regional Combined Transport System – A system study in the greater Stockholm-Mälaren region), the feasibility is evaluated in a bi-sectional manner; first a quantitative assessment is carried out where costs and CO 2 emission are estimated for a set of transport alternatives in the greater Stockholm region, Sweden. The project involves a case study of a shipper’s distribution of daily consumables in the Stockholm-Mälaren region. The case study evaluates the concept of an intermodal <b>liner</b> <b>train,</b> which differs from other conventional rail freight systems, as it similar to a passenger train makes stops along the route for loading and unloading. The quantitative assessment has been accomplished by the development of a cost model, Intermodal Transport Cost Model (ITCM). The most critical parameters are the train’s loading space utilization and the transshipment. The time and cost spent for transshipment of unit loads restrict the competitiveness of intermodal services on shorter distances as these parameters are not proportional to transported distance but rather to the utilization rate of resources. Hence, the concept of cost-efficient small scale (CESS) terminals is introduced and evaluated in this study. Second, a qualitative assessment of the socio-technical system is carried out regarding stakeholders’ perspectives and requirements; based on the participative research i. e. experts involved in in-depth interviews, workshops and a survey. The system must satisfy broader policy objectives of local authorities and commercial corporate interests in order to be adopted. The business model that represents the conceptual idea of the study is identified as ‘the local cooperation model’, where the intermodal transport service is organized by several local actors along a transport route. Regions where cost-leadership coincides with a strong will from local authorities to implement regulations in the freight transport market that promote intermodal transports have created a foundation for implementing short haul intermodal rail freight services. Two operational examples are presented in this thesis; the E&S system in Japan and the Innovatrain system in Switzerland. In the minor research project of the thesis; BIOSUN (Sustainable Intermodal Supply Systems for Biofuel and Bulk Freight), an evaluation is carried out regarding rail-based multimodal transportation of wood biofuels. In essence, it is the factors affecting rail transportation of biofuel and the inherent capability of the rail mode that are addressed. The qualitative evaluation consists of STEEP analysis for the external factors influencing the transport system and sustainability analysis for the internal factors. These methods are complemented by quantitative analysis of a case study, which offered an opportunity to model a rail-based multimodal transport chain for the supply of a heating plant in Gothenburg, Sweden. The results of the case study show that the break-even distance is considerably lower for biofuel transport chains than for other commodities; 180 - 250 km, which is mainly due to the requirement of road-road transshipment as well as the fact that intermodal terminals can be combined with wood processing facilities.

30|$|Shuttle freight trains - {{by their}} nature direct - {{generally}} run between hubs where multiple wagons are consolidated or unbundled for different destination terminals [25]. The shuttle trains generally run with scheduled path allocations. The rail terminals {{may be linked}} with services such as marshalling yards, for consolidating SWLs. Thus, an efficient and effective operation of marshalling yards {{is at the heart}} of the future SWL and other types of freight service in Europe. Instead of a conventional hub and spoke system, we can consider a system of <b>liner</b> <b>trains</b> - a similar concept to liner shipping - where the trains run on a main route and wagons are picked up and dropped at stations along the way.|$|R
30|$|For an {{intermodal}} service, {{the terminal}} cost and time are critical.

Most trailers currently in use are not designed to be lifted onto a railway wagon, so solutions must be found to roll trailers on and off; this will considerably widen the market opportunity.|$|R

30|$|Bärthel and Woxenius [20] have {{suggested}} that, in freight transport markets, intermodal road-rail services {{work best for}} large flows over long distances. Behrends and Flodén 2010 suggest that intermodal <b>liner</b> <b>trains</b> can provide competitive services on short and medium transport distances if transhipment costs are kept low. Speed of travel 1 is a characteristic where rail freight is {{out of step with}} rail passenger trains, although it is still able to compete with road on overall transit times over long distances, as demonstrated on rail freight corridor services such as RETRACK, run by Transpetrol [11]. The average practical speed of a freight train is in the range of 60 - 65  km per hour (versus a theoretical speed of over 100  km/hour). In contrast, the average practical speed of a passenger train is much higher, at 90 – 120  km/hour for regional trains and 180 - 200  km/hour for high-speed trains.|$|R
30|$|Achieving {{modal shift}} from road to rail {{will rely on}} a mixture of both {{customer}} and market related requirements and the necessary associated improvements to the EU’s rail systems. Much of today’s freight rail system {{is based on an}} old standard 3 – 4  MW locomotive, which means trains of 1500 gross tonnes and a length of 650 – 750 metres. However, modern locomotives have a tractive power of 5 – 6  MW, capable of hauling 2000 – 2500 tonne trains, of up to 1000  m in length. In Europe, train lengths up to 850  m are already in operation and experiments have been made with 2 [*]×[*] 750  m[*]=[*] 1500  m long trains. With a higher axle load, the operation of heavier trains can be achieved. Duo-locomotives have been introduced, equipped with both normal electric traction and diesel traction, which can shunt wagons at a marshalling yard, or in an un-electrified siding. Operators thus need only one loco instead of two, also making it possible to introduce <b>liner</b> <b>trains</b> that can stop along the line and change wagons.|$|R
