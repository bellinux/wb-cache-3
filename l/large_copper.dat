5|$|The north half is an unornamented {{vertical}} mass of purple-brown brick, flaring gently out at {{the base}} and top, with vertically continuous bay windows projecting out. The south half is vertically divided by brickwork at the base and rises to a <b>large</b> <b>copper</b> cornice at the roof. Projecting window bays in both halves allow large exposures of glass, giving the building an open appearance despite its mass. The Monadnock {{is part of the}} Printing House Row District, which also includes the Fisher Building, the Manhattan Building, and the Old Colony Building.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Hartnell's grave, {{the grave}} of Private William Braine was largely intact. When he was exhumed, the survey team saw signs that his burial had been hasty. His arms, body, and head had not been {{positioned}} carefully in the coffin, {{and one of his}} undershirts had been put on backwards. The coffin seemed too small for him; its lid had pressed down on his nose. A <b>large</b> <b>copper</b> plaque with his name and other personal data punched into it adorned his coffin lid.|$|E
5|$|Like Castile soap, {{the chief}} {{ingredients}} of Nabulsi soap are virgin olive oil, water, and an alkaline sodium compound. The compound {{is made by}} mixing the powdered ashes of the barilla plant (qilw) which grows {{along the banks of}} the River Jordan with locally supplied lime (sheed). The sodium compound is then heated with water and the olive oil in <b>large</b> <b>copper</b> vats over fermentation pits. The solution of water and the sodium compound becomes increasingly concentrated in a series of 40 cycles repeated over eight days. During that time, an oar-shaped wooden tool known as a dukshab is used to stir the liquid soap continuously. The liquid soap is then spread in wooden frames to set. After setting, it is cut into the classic cube shape of Nabulsi soap and stamped with the company's trademark seal. The soap cubes then undergo a drying process which can last from three months to a year and involves stacking them in ceiling-high structures resembling cones with hollow centers which allow the air to circulate around the cubes.|$|E

5|$|Copperbelt was a {{province}} in Northern Rhodesia which was rich in deposits of the mineral. Cecil John Rhodes, a British capitalist and empire builder, {{was the leading}} light of British expansion north of the Limpopo River into south-central Africa. In 1895, Rhodes asked his American scout Frederick Russell Burnham to look for minerals and how to improve river navigation in the region; during this trek, Burnham discovered <b>large</b> <b>copper</b> deposits along the Kafue River. Rhodes brought British influence into the region by obtaining mineral rights from local chiefs through questionable treaties. The Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1891, signed in Lisbon on 11 June 1891 by the United Kingdom and Portugal, fixed the boundary between territories administered by the British South Africa Company (BSAC) in North-Eastern Rhodesia and Portuguese Mozambique. It also fixed {{the boundary between the}} BSAC-administered territory of North-Western Rhodesia (now in Zambia) and Portuguese Angola, although the boundary with Angola was not marked on the ground until later. The northern border of the British territory in North-Eastern Rhodesia and the British Central Africa Protectorate was agreed in an 1890 Anglo-German treaty which also fixed the (very short) boundary between North-Western Rhodesia and German South-West Africa, now Namibia. The boundary between the Congo Free State and British territory was fixed by an 1894 treaty, although minor adjustments were made until the 1930s. The border between the British Central Africa Protectorate and North-Eastern Rhodesia was fixed in 1891 at the drainage divide between Lake Malawi and the Luangwa River, and the boundary between North-Western Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia became the Zambezi River in 1898. Northern Rhodesia was under BSAC control until 1924, when it became part of the British Empire.|$|E

25|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} the Basilica's exterior is the <b>large</b> <b>copper</b> dome. The dome, measuring 165 feet in height, was second in size only to the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C. {{at the time of}} its completion in 1926. Over the years, the dome's original copper has aged to a green patina, as expected. Four copper angel statues playing trumpets, measuring 18 feet tall, are mounted on the dome.|$|E
25|$|By 1904, {{there were}} three <b>large</b> <b>copper</b> {{smelters}} and one lead smelter in the Salt Lake valley. The sulfur dioxide gas emissions from the smokestacks caused significant crop damage to neighboring crops. During the 1904-1905 winter, the farmers gathered together and decided to file suit against the smelters in the United States District Court of Utah. In 1906, Federal Court Judge Marshall ruled that the smelters could not smelt ores containing more than 10% sulfur, effectively closing all of the aforementioned smelters.|$|E

25|$|On hot days, hinged wooden panels {{fold down}} to expose <b>large</b> <b>copper</b> screens {{to provide a}} great deal of ventilation. These panels and {{numerous}} windows cover most of the outside perimeter of the cabins. From the 1960s through 1980s, they hardly seemed necessary, for the hemlock trees formed a thick canopy and kept the shaded grounds cool. However, in the early 1990s, the hemlock woolly adelgid began destroying the hemlock trees, so the surrounding forest is again scattered with dead and fallen trees as in Hoover's day.|$|E
25|$|In 1987 Cominco Alaska Exploration (CAE) (which {{subsequently}} became Teck Resources) collected mineralized surface samples at the Pebble {{site from}} color anomalies visible from aircraft. The first two exploration holes were drilled in 1988; in 1989 twelve more drill holes, soil sampling, and geophysical surveys {{indicated that the}} Pebble West occurrence (originally named Pebble Beach) {{was part of a}} <b>large</b> <b>copper</b> porphyry system. CAE continued drilling and other work through 1992, with a second drill campaign in 1997, with the resource doubled from 500M short tons to 1B short tons.|$|E
25|$|The central Parliament Building {{was built}} to be visible and is topped with several <b>large</b> <b>copper</b> domes. The {{interior}} was decorated by 38 artists {{from every corner of}} the country. Three major themes tied all the works together. The first theme, national history, is represented by events and persons from Swiss history. This includes the Rütlischwur or the foundation of Switzerland in 1291 and figures such as William Tell, Arnold von Winkelried and Nicholas of Flüe. The second theme is the fundamental principles that Switzerland was founded on; including independence, freedom, separation of government powers, order and security. The final theme is the cultural and material variety of Switzerland; including politically (represented by Canton flags), geographically and socially.|$|E

25|$|The {{main part}} of the {{sculpture}} is located in the northwest corner of the New Headquarters Building courtyard, outside of the Agency's cafeteria. The sculpture comprises four <b>large</b> <b>copper</b> plates with other elements consisting of water, wood, plants, red and green granite, white quartz, and petrified wood. The most prominent feature is a large vertical S-shaped copper screen resembling a scroll or a piece of paper emerging from a computer printer, half of which consists of encrypted text. The characters are all found within the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet, along with question marks, and are cut out of the copper plates. The main sculpture contains four separate enigmatic messages, three of which have been deciphered.|$|E
25|$|Khoruhva {{was mostly}} of a crimson color {{embroidered}} with coats of arms, saints, crosses, and others. It was always carried {{in front of}} the army next to the hetman or otaman. A badge (znachok) was a name for a kurin's or company's (sotnia) banners. There was a tradition when the newly elected colonel was required at his own expense prepare palanka's banner. One of the banners was preserved until 1845 in Kuban and was made out of tissue in two colors: yellow and blue. Kettledrums (lytavry) were <b>large</b> <b>copper</b> boilers that were fitted with a leather which served for transmission of various signals (calling cossacks to a council, raising an alarm etc.).|$|E
25|$|Campbell River prospered after 1912 and {{it became}} a supply point for {{northern}} Vancouver Island, Quadra Island and Cortes Island. The E and N Railway was surveyed to Campbell River, yet it only reached Courtenay, forty miles south; in its original conception {{it would have been the}} last leg of the transcontinental railway, which had been proposed to run down Bute Inlet after cross the British Columbia Interior, connecting to Vancouver Island just north of Campbell River at Seymour Narrows. After the Second World War, Campbell River became a boom town and industrial centre with the building of the John Hart Dam, Elk River pulp mill, and nearby mills in Tahsis and Gold River. Logging and mining in the area prospered. There is a lead zinc mine nearby, and coal mines, while a <b>large</b> <b>copper</b> mine operated to the north.|$|E

25|$|Iron ore {{reserves}} {{are found in}} most provinces, including Hainan. Gansu, Guizhou, southern Sichuan, and Guangdong provinces have rich deposits. The largest mined {{reserves are}} located north of the Yangtze River and supply neighboring iron and steel enterprises. With the exception of nickel, chromium, and cobalt, China is well supplied with ferroalloys and manganese. Reserves of tungsten are also known to be fairly <b>large.</b> <b>Copper</b> resources are moderate, and high-quality ore is present only in a few deposits. Discoveries have been reported from Ningxia. Lead and zinc are available, and bauxite resources {{are thought to be}} plentiful. China's antimony reserves are the largest in the world. Tin resources are plentiful, and there are fairly rich deposits of gold. China is the world's fifth largest producer of gold and in the early 21st century became an important producer and exporter of rare metals needed in high-technology industries.|$|E
500|$|Until it was removed, the {{original}} lightning protection system {{was connected to}} the tops of the four iron columns supporting the elevator with <b>large</b> <b>copper</b> rods. Even though the aluminum apex is still connected to the columns with <b>large</b> <b>copper</b> rods, it is no longer part of the lightning protection system because it is now disconnected from the present lightning rods which shield it. The two lightning rods present since 2013 are connected to the iron columns with two large braided aluminum cables leading down the surface of the pyramidion near its southeast and northwest corners. They enter the pyramidion at its base, where they are tied together (electrically shorted) via large braided aluminum cables encircling the pyramidion [...] above its base. The bottom of the iron columns are connected to ground water below the monument via four <b>large</b> <b>copper</b> rods that pass through a [...] square well half filled with sand {{in the center of the}} foundation. The effectiveness of the lightning protection system has not been affected by a significant draw down of the water table since 1884 because the soil's water content remains roughly 20% both above and below the height of the water table.|$|E
