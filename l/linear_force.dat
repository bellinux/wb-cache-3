These periodic piecewise <b>linear</b> <b>forces</b> are selected in the range [− 1, 1] to establish an exact comparison with harmonic forces.

40|$|Drift wave {{turbulence}}, {{in general}} {{a balance between}} E x B drift turbulence in planes perpendicular to, and dissipative wave dynamics parallel to, a background magnetic field, is a hallmark example of nonlinearity in plasma physics. The turbulence generally has the same basic character in a sheared magnetic field lying in closed surfaces whether linear instabilities are present or not. Only when the <b>linear</b> <b>forcing</b> terms are dominant does this situation not prevail; it is not analogous to neutral fluid turbulence where pure <b>linear</b> <b>forcing</b> is balanced by pure nonlinear mixing and decorrelation. Detailed computations show that two types of nonlinearity are simultaneously present: advection of fluid vorticity by the E x B flows, which tends to have a scattering character, and E x B advection of pressure disturbances, which has the familiar diffusive mixing character. The vorticity nonlinearity excites the turbulence, acting against the mostly linear parallel dynamics which constrains it, while the pressure nonlinearity provides dissipation via transfer to ever smaller scales. The practical {{result is that the}} saturated level of the turbulence and the resulting averaged thermal energy transport are controlled principally by these nonlinear mechanisms even when moderate linear instabilities are present. The model is mostly applicable to tokamak edge turbulence, for which the <b>linear</b> <b>forcing</b> effects are sufficiently moderate that the nonlinear physics is allowed to operate...|$|R

2500|$|The Transrapid maglev {{system uses}} a {{synchronous}} longstator linear motor for both propulsion and braking. It {{works like a}} rotating electric motor whose stator is [...] "unrolled" [...] along {{the underside of the}} guideway; instead of producing torque (rotation) it produces a <b>linear</b> <b>force</b> along its length. The electromagnets in the maglev vehicle which lift it also work as the equivalent of the excitation portion (rotor) of this linear electric motor. Since the magnetic travelling field works in only one direction, if there were to be several maglev trains on a given track section, they would all travel in the same direction thereby reducing the possibility of collision between moving trains.|$|E

50|$|In 2015, Shred {{introduced}} one of {{the first}} helmet systems designed to not only address the <b>linear</b> <b>forces</b> of impact energy, but also its rotational forces. Historically, helmets only mitigated the effects of <b>linear</b> <b>forces,</b> leaving skiers, bikers, and snowboarders more susceptible to injury. Shred’s patent pending Rotational Energy System (RES) mimics the natural cushioning behavior of the fluid between the skull and the brain. RES redirects rotational forces by allowing a small amount of relative movement between the helmet and the head during impacts from any direction. This reduces rotational energy transferred to the head. Since its inception, RES has been notable for its ability to offer protection from rotational energy in all directions. Unlike other systems, it has no preferential directions that compromise the protection the helmet affords. It also has minimal impact on the helmet’s weight and dimensions.|$|R

40|$|Stationary {{isotropic}} turbulence is often studied numerically {{by adding a}} forcing term to the Navier-Stokes equation. This is usually done {{for the purpose of}} achieving higher Reynolds number and longer statistics than is possible for isotropic decaying turbulence. It is generally accepted that forcing the Navier-Stokes equation at low wave number does not influence the small scale statistics of the flow provided that there is wide separation between the largest and smallest scales. It will be shown, however, that the spectral width of the forcing has a noticeable effect on inertial range statistics. A case will be made here for using a broader form of forcing in order to compare computed isotropic stationary turbulence with (decaying) grid turbulence. It is shown that using a forcing function which is directly proportional to the velocity has physical meaning and gives results which are closer to both homogeneous and non-homogeneous turbulence. Section 1 presents a four part series of motivations for <b>linear</b> <b>forcing.</b> Section 2 puts <b>linear</b> <b>forcing</b> to a numerical test with a pseudospectral computation...|$|R
50|$|When an {{unbalanced}} system is rotating, periodic <b>linear</b> and/or torsional <b>forces</b> are generated which are {{perpendicular to the}} axis of rotation. The periodic nature of these forces is commonly experienced as vibration. These off-axis vibration forces may exceed the design limits of individual machine elements, reducing the service life of these parts. For instance, a bearing may be subjected to perpendicular torsion forces that would not occur in a nominally balanced system, or the instantaneous <b>linear</b> <b>forces</b> may exceed {{the limits of the}} bearing. Such excessive forces will cause failure in bearings in short time periods. Shafts with unbalanced masses can be bent by the forces and experience fatigue failure.|$|R
