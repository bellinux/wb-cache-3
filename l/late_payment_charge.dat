It was a self declaration tax with no bills being issued to property owners, leaving many caught unaware. The scheme was abandoned in 2014 with first and final bills/letters being issued to home owners. Severe penalties were attached to these letters, a <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> <b>charge</b> which amounted to 600 per cent of the premium (€1,000). [...] In 2014 home owners, of which a significant number were non-resident in Ireland, were facing NPPR penalties up to €7,230 which remains as a permanent charge on the property until fully paid. There was uproar {{about the size of the}} penalties, especially from people who live overseas [...] and who say they knew nothing about the NPPR charge until they got these letters. Many feel the 600 per cent penalty charge to be unconstitutional and some have taken their case to the Ombudsman.|$|E

40|$|A thesis submittedThe poor trust {{culture in}} the {{construction}} sector is often considered an inhibiting factor to collaboration success in the United Kingdom (UK) despite reform efforts. Numerous reform initiatives tend to have focused on improvements in client and main contractor aspects of construction supply chain relationships, prompting claims that failure to integrate subcontractors, suppliers and consultants into collaborative arrangements remains a major shortcoming. Main contractor and subcontractor relationships therefore continue to be typified by such problems as <b>late</b> <b>payments,</b> <b>charging</b> fees to tender for work, award of contracts based on cheapest price rather than best value, negative margins and demand of retrospective discounts and cash rebates; all of which negatively impact on trust. Some main contractor organisations however, continue to embed supply chain management practices as a strategy for levering value from subcontractors. Such collaborative practices and their implications for inter-organisational trust development, and indeed overall project outcomes, have nonetheless received limited attention in construction management research, raising significant questions on the empirical basis for their implementation. This research was thus undertaken to investigate strategic supply chain management practices adopted by UK main contractors {{and its implications for}} inter-organisational trust development during projects. The study adopts a multiple case study design so as to unravel complex subtleties of inter-organisational trust development in the main contractors’ supply chain during projects. With four purposefully selected UK main contractor organisations that had implemented strategic supply chain management, data was gathered through a supply chain workshop, semi-structured interviews, passive observations and documentary analysis. From analysis of the data, it was revealed that strategic supply chain management practices of the main contractors were instrumental for trust manifestation across cognition, system and relational based dimensions. These practices served as constitutive elements of face-to-face interactions through which inter-organisational trust developed, whilst providing the institutional framework to which respective supply chain parties directed their psychological expectations. These findings highlight the importance of maintaining a core of subcontractors from which the main contractor can leverage long-term value irrespective of economic climate. This can be achieved by adequately prioritizing relationally trusted subcontractors for sensitive and high risk work packages whilst ensuring that strategic supply chain management principles can be used to engender impersonal (cognition and system-based) trust dimensions amongst other subcontractors used on a project. Accordingly, a supply chain management oriented framework for engendering inter-organisational trust during projects has been developed based on the study findings and evaluated through semi-structured interviews with selected target participants. This framework does not only provide a systematic and coherent approach for implementing or benchmarking strategic supply chain management in a main contractor’s organisation, but {{can also be used to}} prioritize and promote different trust dimensions and their associated behavioural consequences on projects, depending on perceived work package risks...|$|R

40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} data are examined {{in an analysis}} of habitual <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> of trade credit by UK small firms. Multivariate logistic regression is employed to test the influence of variables expected to discriminate between small firms which pay late habitually and those which never or only occasionally pay late. Case studies extend quantitative analysis by validating interpretation of the results and providing explanations for unexpected outcomes. The results provide strong evidence of a financing demand for habitual <b>late</b> <b>payment.</b> There is a positive relationship between habitual <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> and difficulty obtaining bank finance and <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> by debtors and a negative relationship with the use of long term sources of finance. The influence of relationships between customer and supplier is shown to be complex. A concentrated supplier base is shown to be positively associated with <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> and case studies provide evidence that this is because increased knowledge of suppliers' credit management procedures is used to pay late without penalties.

This led to the study’s problem statement that stipulates that, the construction industry; particularly emerging contractors generally experience <b>late</b> <b>payments</b> from clients and employers. This {{is due to the}} fact that emerging contractors are vulnerable to failing as these contractors have limited financial resources and experience. The primary objective of the study was to develop a better understanding of the implications of <b>late</b> <b>payments</b> by the government on emerging construction contractors. The study therefore investigated the experiences of emerging construction contractors in the Eastern Cape. The secondary objectives of the study were: to identify the reasons for <b>late</b> <b>payments</b> by the public sector; determine the payment norms applicable to, and expectations of emerging construction contractors; establish construction contractors’ experiences with government payment methods; and to examine the implications of <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> on emerging contractors and their businesses. The study was conducted within a qualitative research paradigm. The participants were identified through non-probability snowball sampling. The sample consisted of five emerging construction contractors mainly from the Civil Engineering and General Building sectors in the Eastern Cape. The data was collected using semi-structured interviewing and was analysed using Tesch’s qualitative analysis explained by Hesse-Biber & Leavy (2011 : 201). The key results of the empirical study show that <b>late</b> <b>payments</b> have incapacitating effects on the development of emerging contractors.

40|$|We study {{mechanism}} design {{where the}} objective is to maximize the residual surplus, i. e., the total value of the outcome minus the <b>payments</b> <b>charged</b> to the agents, by truthful mechanisms. The motivation comes from applications where the <b>payments</b> <b>charged</b> are not in the form of actual monetary transfers, but take the form of wasted resources. We consider a general mechanism design setting with m discrete outcomes and n multidimensional agents. We present two randomized truthful mechanisms that extract an O(logm) fraction of the maximum social surplus as residual surplus. The first mechanism achieves an O(logm) -approximation to the social surplus, which is improved to an O(1) -approximation by the second mechanism. An interesting feature of the second mechanism is that it optimizes over an appropriately restricted space of probability distributions, thus achieving an efficient tradeoff between social surplus and the total amount of <b>payments</b> <b>charged</b> to the agents.
