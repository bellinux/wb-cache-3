5|$|Luciferin-luciferase {{reactions}} {{are not the}} only way that organisms produce light. The parchment worm Chaetopterus (a marine Polychaete) makes use of another photoprotein, aequorin, instead of <b>luciferase.</b> When calcium ions are added, the aequorin's rapid catalysis creates a brief flash quite unlike the prolonged glow produced by <b>luciferase.</b> In a second, much slower, step luciferin is regenerated from the oxidised (oxyluciferin) form, allowing it to recombine with aequorin, in readiness for a subsequent flash. Photoproteins are thus enzymes, but with unusual reaction kinetics.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescent {{organisms are}} {{a target for}} many areas of research. <b>Luciferase</b> systems are widely used in genetic {{engineering}} as reporter genes, each producing a different colour by fluorescence, and for biomedical research using bioluminescence imaging. For example, the firefly <b>luciferase</b> gene was used as early as 1986 for research using transgenic tobacco plants. Vibrio bacteria symbiose with marine invertebrates such as the Hawaiian bobtail squid (Euprymna scolopes), are key experimental models for bioluminescence. Bioluminescent activated destruction is an experimental cancer treatment. See also optogenetics which {{involves the use of}} light to control cells in living tissue, typically neurons, that have been genetically modified to express light-sensitive ion channels, and also see biophoton, a photon of non-thermal origin in the visible and ultraviolet spectrum emitted from a biological system.|$|E
5|$|Carbon dioxide (CO2), {{adenosine}} monophosphate (AMP) and phosphate groups (PP) are released as waste products. <b>Luciferase</b> catalyzes the reaction, {{which may be}} mediated by cofactors such as calcium (Ca2+) or magnesium (Mg2+) ions, and for some types of luciferin (L) also the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The reaction can occur either inside or outside the cell. In bacteria such as Aliivibrio, the expression of genes related to bioluminescence {{is controlled by the}} lux operon.|$|E
5|$|In {{a general}} sense, the {{principal}} chemical reaction in bioluminescence involves some light-emitting molecule and an enzyme, generally called the luciferin and the <b>luciferase,</b> respectively. Because these are generic names, the luciferins and luciferases are often distinguished by including the species or group, i.e. Firefly luciferin. In all characterized cases, the enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of the luciferin.|$|E
5|$|In some species, the <b>luciferase</b> {{requires}} other cofactors such as calcium or magnesium ions, {{and sometimes}} also the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In evolution, luciferins vary little: one in particular, coelenterazine, {{is found in}} eleven different animal (phyla), though in some of these, the animals obtain it through their diet. Conversely, luciferases vary widely between different species, and consequently bioluminescence has arisen over forty times in evolutionary history.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes serve a {{wide variety}} of {{functions}} inside living organisms. They are indispensable for signal transduction and cell regulation, often via kinases and phosphatases. They also generate movement, with myosin hydrolyzing ATP to generate muscle contraction, and also transport cargo around the cell as part of the cytoskeleton. Other ATPases in the cell membrane are ion pumps involved in active transport. Enzymes are also involved in more exotic functions, such as <b>luciferase</b> generating light in fireflies. Viruses can also contain enzymes for infecting cells, such as the HIV integrase and reverse transcriptase, or for viral release from cells, like the influenza virus neuraminidase.|$|E
5|$|In evolution, luciferins {{generally}} vary little: one in particular, coelenterazine, is {{the light}} emitting pigment for nine ancient phyla (groups of very different organisms), including polycystine radiolaria, Cercozoa (Phaeodaria), protozoa, comb jellies, cnidaria including jellyfish and corals, crustaceans, molluscs, arrow worms and vertebrates (ray-finned fish). Not all these organisms synthesize coelenterazine: {{some of them}} obtain it through their diet. Conversely, <b>luciferase</b> enzymes vary widely and tend to be different in each species. Overall, bioluminescence has arisen over forty times in evolutionary history.|$|E
5|$|Tbr1 forms {{a complex}} with CASK and regulates gene {{expression}} in cortical development. Tbr1 binds to the guanylate kinase (GK) domain of CASK. It {{was determined that}} the C-terminal domain of Tbr1 in crucial and solely capable of this process. Through <b>luciferase</b> reporter assays of neurons in the hippocampus, {{it was found that}} increased Tbr1/CASK complex expression results in enhanced promoter activity in genes downstream of TBR1 such as NMDAR subunit 2b (NMDAR2b), glycine transporter, interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) and OX-2 genes. NMDAR2b experienced the greatest change in activity.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{bioluminescence}} {{is caused}} by the action of luciferases, enzymes that produce light by the oxidation of a luciferin (a pigment). Several studies have evaluated the biochemical basis of light production in Panellus stipticus, and concluded that there is no specific fungal <b>luciferase.</b> The fungus was shown in 1988 to contain the sesquiterpene panal, which has a cadinene keto-aldehyde chemical structure. Later, two additional precursors were isolated, PS-A (1-O-decanoylpanal) and PS-B (1-O-dodecanoylpanal). If these compounds are treated with salt of ammonia or primary amines in the presence of iron(II), hydrogen peroxide, and a cationic surfactant, light is emitted by a chemiluminescence reaction, suggesting that panal and its derivatives are fungal luciferins, and that the chemiluminescence reaction is the cause of in vivo bioluminescence. In the fungus, the level of activity of the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) appears to {{play a critical role in}} the amount of light emission. SOD quenches the effect of the superoxide (O2−) anion required in the reaction, and thus SOD activity has to be inhibited for the reaction to occur.|$|E
25|$|Light {{production}} in fireflies {{is due to}} a type of chemical reaction called bioluminescence. This process occurs in specialized light-emitting organs, usually on a firefly's lower abdomen. The enzyme <b>luciferase</b> acts on the luciferin, in the presence of magnesium ions, ATP, and oxygen to produce light. Gene coding for these substances has been inserted into many different organisms (see <b>Luciferase</b> – Applications). Firefly <b>luciferase</b> is used in forensics, and the enzyme has medical uses — in particular, for detecting the presence of ATP or magnesium.|$|E
25|$|Luminescent Bacteria: Hastings {{investigations}} of luminous bacteria {{acted as a}} catalyst for the discoveries of the biochemical mechanisms involved in their light production, the discovery of a flavin to be a substrate in its <b>luciferase</b> reaction, the determination of gene regulation of the luciferases, and the first evidence for quorum sensing, a form of bacterial communication. In quorum sensing (initially termed autoinduction), the bacteria release a substance into the medium, the autoinducer. Once the concentration of this substance reaches a critical level (a measure of the number of bacteria in a limited area), transcription of specific other genes that had been repressed are turned on. Once the sequenced autoinducer gene was found to occur widely in gram-negative bacteria quorum sensing became accepted in the early 1990s. It is now known that in many pathogenic bacteria, there is delayed production of toxins, which serve to greatly augment their pathogenicity, this is similar to what happens for <b>luciferase</b> proteins. By curtailing their toxin output until the bacterial populations are substantial, these bacteria can generate massive quantities of toxin quickly and thereby swamp the defences of the host.|$|E
25|$|Different glands {{specialize}} {{for different}} pheromones produced for finding mates. Pheromones from species of Rutelinea are produced from epithelial cells lining the inner {{surface of the}} apical abdominal segments or amino acid based pheromones of Melolonthinae from eversible glands on the abdominal apex. Other species produce different types of pheromones. Dermestids produce esters, and species of Elateridae produce fatty-acid-derived aldehydes and acetates. For means of finding a mate also, fireflies (Lampyridae) utilized modified fat body cells with transparent surfaces backed with reflective uric acid crystals to biosynthetically produce light, or bioluminescence. The light produce is highly efficient, as it is produced by oxidation of luciferin by the enzymes <b>luciferase</b> {{in the presence of}} ATP (adenosine triphospate) and oxygen, producing oxyluciferin, carbon dioxide, and light.|$|E
25|$|Except for Bentheuphausia amblyops, krill are bioluminescent animals having organs called photophores {{that can}} emit light. The light is {{generated}} by an enzyme-catalysed chemiluminescence reaction, wherein a luciferin (a kind of pigment) is activated by a <b>luciferase</b> enzyme. Studies indicate that the luciferin of many krill species is a fluorescent tetrapyrrole similar but not identical to dinoflagellate luciferin and that the krill probably do not produce this substance themselves but acquire {{it as part of}} their diet, which contains dinoflagellates. Krill photophores are complex organs with lenses and focusing abilities, and can be rotated by muscles. The precise function of these organs is as yet unknown; possibilities include mating, social interaction or orientation and as a form of counter-illumination camouflage to compensate their shadow against overhead ambient light.|$|E
25|$|Other {{luminescent}} systems: Early in {{his career}} Hastings developed techniques to quantify the level of oxygen required in a luminescent reaction for several different species including bacteria, fungi, fireflies and ostracod crustaceans. This work showed that oxygen gating is the mechanism for firefly flashing. In other work {{when he was in}} the McElroy lab he examined the basic biochemical mechanism of firefly <b>luciferase</b> and demonstrated that coenzyme A stimulates light emission. His lab first demonstrated that the green in vivo coelenterate bioluminescence occurs because of energy transfer from the luminescent molecule (aequorin), which alone emits blue light, to a secondary green emitter which they termed green fluorescent protein (GFP). Once characterized and cloned, GFP has become a crucial molecule used as a reporter and tagging tool for studying gene activation and developmental patterns. Osamu Shimomura, Martin Chalfie and Roger Tsien received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2008 for their work on this remarkable molecule.|$|E

500|$|Bioluminescence is the {{production}} of light, such as by the photophores of marine animals, and the tails of glow-worms and fireflies. Bioluminescence, like other forms of metabolism, releases energy derived from the chemical energy of food. A pigment, [...] luciferin is catalysed by the enzyme <b>luciferase</b> to react with oxygen, releasing light. Comb jellies such as Euplokamis are bioluminescent, creating blue and green light, especially when stressed; when disturbed, they secrete an ink which luminesces in the same colours. Since comb jellies are not very sensitive to light, their bioluminescence {{is unlikely to be}} used to signal to other members of the same species (e.g. to attract mates or repel rivals); more likely, the light helps to distract predators or parasites. Some species of squid have light-producing organs (photophores) scattered all over their undersides that create a sparkling glow. This provides counter-illumination camouflage, preventing the animal from appearing as a dark shape when seen from below.|$|E
500|$|Scientists at Oxford University {{reported}} the self-assembly of four short strands of synthetic DNA into a cage which can enter cells and survive {{for at least}} 48 hours. [...] The fluorescently labeled DNA tetrahedra were found to remain intact in the laboratory cultured human kidney cells despite the attack by cellular enzymes after two days. [...] This experiment showed the potential of drug delivery inside the living cells using the DNA ‘cage’. [...] A DNA tetrahedron was used to deliver RNA Interference (RNAi) in a mouse model, reported {{a team of researchers}} in MIT. [...] Delivery of the interfering RNA for treatment has showed some success using polymer or lipid, but there are limits of safety and imprecise targeting, in addition to short shelf life in the blood stream. [...] The DNA nanostructure created by the team consists of six strands of DNA to form a tetrahedron, with one strand of RNA affixed to each of the six edges. [...] The tetrahedron is further equipped with targeting protein, three folate molecules, which lead the DNA nanoparticles to the abundant folate receptors found on some tumors. [...] The result showed that the gene expression targeted by the RNAi, <b>luciferase,</b> dropped by more than half. [...] This study shows promise in using DNA nanotechnology as an effective tool to deliver treatment using the emerging RNA Interference technology.|$|E

2500|$|The glow is {{the result}} of a {{chemical}} reaction that involves luciferin, the substrate; <b>luciferase,</b> the enzyme that acts upon luciferin; adenosine triphosphate, the energy molecule; and oxygen. [...] It occurs in modified excretory organs known as Malpighian tubules in the abdomen.|$|E
2500|$|Fluorescence is not {{the only}} type of {{luminescence}} achievable in biological systems: Chemiluminescence, the generation of light by means of chemical reactions, is produced by some protein, such as Aqueorin from symbiont in jellyfish and <b>luciferase</b> from symbiont in fireflies. These have been used to make glucose sensors: Daunert makes a -split Aqueorin sensor and Koji Sode in 2009 made [...] -luciferase with Asp459Asn (Glc not Gal).|$|E
2500|$|Other {{commonly}} used reporter genes are {{green fluorescent protein}} (GFP), which produces cells that glow green under blue light, and the enzyme <b>luciferase,</b> which catalyzes a reaction with luciferin to emit light. [...] The recombinant DNA may also be detected using other methods such as nucleic acid hybridization with radioactive RNA probe, while cells that expressed the desired protein from the plasmid may also be detected using immunological methods.|$|E
2500|$|Luminescent Dinoflagellates: In early 1954 at Northwestern University, Hastings, his {{students}} and colleagues studied cellular and molecular aspects of bioluminescence in dinoflagellates [...] They elucidated {{the structures of}} the luciferins and luciferases, the organization and regulation of their associated genes, temporal control mechanisms, and the actual sub-cellular identity and location of the light emitting elements, which they termed scintillons. They demonstrated that the reaction is controlled by a drop in pH when an action potential leads to the entry of protons via voltage-activated membrane channels in the scintillons. Through immunolocalization studies the Hastings lab showed that scintillons are small peripheral vesicles (0.4 μm) that contain both the <b>luciferase</b> and the luciferin-binding protein. More recently, the lab found that the <b>luciferase</b> gene in Lingulodinium polyedrum and other closely related species contains three homologous and contiguous repeated sequences {{in a kind of}} [...] "three-ring circus with the same act in all three." [...] However, another luminescent, but heterotrophic, dinoflagellate, Noctiluca scintillans, has but a single protein, which appears to possess both catalytic and substrate binding properties in a single, rather than separate proteins.|$|E
2500|$|Reporter genes: Some vectors {{may contain}} a {{reporter}} gene {{that allow for}} identification of plasmid that contains inserted DNA sequence. [...] An example is lacZ-α which codes for the N-terminus fragment of β-galactosidase, an enzyme that digests galactose. [...] A multiple cloning site is located within lacZ-α, and an insert successfully ligated into the vector will disrupt the gene sequence, resulting in an inactive β-galactosidase. [...] Cells containing vector with an insert may be identified using blue/white selection by growing cells in media containing an analogue of galactose (X-gal). Cells expressing β-galactosidase (therefore doesn't contain an insert) appear as blue colonies. White colonies would be selected as those that may contain an insert. Other commonly used reporters include green fluorescent protein and <b>luciferase.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The DNA {{transmission}} {{capabilities of}} Agrobacterium have been vastly explored in biotechnology {{as a means}} of inserting foreign genes into plants. Marc Van Montagu and Jeff Schell, (University of Ghent and Plant Genetic Systems, Belgium) discovered the gene transfer mechanism between Agrobacterium and plants, which resulted in the development of methods to alter the bacterium into an efficient delivery system for genetic engineering in plants. The plasmid T-DNA that is transferred to the plant is an ideal vehicle for genetic engineering. [...] This is done by cloning a desired gene sequence into the T-DNA that will be inserted into the host DNA. [...] This process has been performed using firefly <b>luciferase</b> gene to produce glowing plants. [...] This luminescence has been a useful device in the study of plant chloroplast function and as a reporter gene. It is also possible to transform Arabidopsis thaliana by dipping flowers into a broth of Agrobacterium: the seed produced will be transgenic. Under laboratory conditions, the T-DNA has also been transferred to human cells, demonstrating the diversity of insertion application.|$|E

50|$|BRET {{has also}} been {{implemented}} using a different <b>luciferase</b> enzyme, engineered from the deep-sea shrimp Oplophorus gracilirostris. This <b>luciferase</b> is smaller (19 kD) and brighter than the more commonly used <b>luciferase</b> from Renilla reniformis. Promega has developed this <b>luciferase</b> variant under the product name NanoLuc.|$|E
50|$|Dinoflagellate <b>luciferase</b> is {{a single}} protein with three <b>luciferase</b> domains.|$|E
50|$|<b>Luciferase</b> {{can also}} be used to detect the level of {{cellular}} ATP in cell viability assays or for kinase activity assays. <b>Luciferase</b> can act as an ATP sensor protein through biotinylation. Biotinylation will immobilize <b>luciferase</b> on the cell-surface by binding to a streptavidin-biotin complex. This allows <b>luciferase</b> to detect the efflux of ATP from the cell and will effectively display the real-time release of ATP through bioluminescence. <b>Luciferase</b> can additionally be made more sensitive for ATP detection by increasing the luminescence intensity by changing certain amino acid residues in the sequence of the protein.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} see whether p53 re-expression in cancer cells (that have lost p53 expression) has the suppressive effect on the {{promoter}} of the survivin gene, a <b>luciferase</b> reporter construct was made. The isolated survivin promoter was placed upstream of the <b>luciferase</b> reporter gene. In a <b>luciferase</b> reporter assay, if the promoter is active, the <b>luciferase</b> gene is transcribed and translated into a product that gives off light that can measured quantitatively and, thus, represents {{the activity of the}} promoter. This construct was transfected into cancer cells that had either wild-type or mutant p53. High <b>luciferase</b> activity was measured in the cells with mutant p53 and significantly lower <b>luciferase</b> levels were measured for cells with wild-type p53.|$|E
50|$|Evidence also {{suggests}} that bacterial <b>luciferase</b> contributes to the resistance of oxidative stress. In laboratory culture, luxA and luxB mutants of Vibrio harveyi , which lacked <b>luciferase</b> activity, showed impairment of growth under high oxidative stress compared to wild type. The luxD mutants, which had an unaffected <b>luciferase</b> but were unable to produce luminescence, showed little or no difference. This suggests that <b>luciferase</b> mediates the detoxification of reactive oxygen.|$|E

50|$|As a {{pioneering}} chronobiologist, Millar {{is known for}} his use of <b>luciferase</b> reporters for the purpose of studying plant circadian biology. Millar began experimenting with the firefly <b>luciferase</b> reporter gene as a graduate student at The Rockefeller University. In 1992, Millar and colleagues fused the Arabidopsis cab2 promoter and the firefly <b>luciferase</b> gene to establish a real-time reporter for circadian-regulated gene expression in plants. Millar tracked the rhythm of transcription from the cab2 promoter using a low-light video imaging system which tracks <b>luciferase</b> bioluminescence. Millar hypothesized that this model could be used to isolate mutants in the plant circadian clock.|$|E
