25|$|Recovery time {{following}} {{laparoscopic surgery}} is shorter and less painful than following traditional abdominal surgery. Instead {{of opening the}} pelvic cavity with a wide incision (laparotomy), a laparoscope (a thin, <b>lighted</b> <b>tube)</b> and surgical instruments are inserted into the pelvic cavity via small incisions. Rectopexy and anterior resection have been performed laparoscopically with good results.|$|E

50|$|Transurethral biopsy is {{a biopsy}} {{procedure}} {{in which a}} sample of tissue {{is removed from the}} prostate for examination under a microscope.

50|$|Breast duct {{endoscopy}} is {{a method}} {{used to examine the}} lining of the lactiferous ducts to look for abnormal tissue. A very thin, flexible, <b>lighted</b> <b>tube</b> attached to a camera is inserted through the nipple, and threaded into the breast ducts deep in the breast. Tissue and fluid samples may be removed during the procedure.|$|E
50|$|Laparoscopic proceduresRecovery time {{following}} {{laparoscopic surgery}} is shorter and less painful than following traditional abdominal surgery. Instead {{of opening the}} pelvic cavity with a wide incision (laparotomy), a laparoscope (a thin, <b>lighted</b> <b>tube)</b> and surgical instruments are inserted into the pelvic cavity via small incisions.

50|$|Endoscopy: the esophageal mucosa can be visualized {{directly}} by passing a thin, <b>lighted</b> <b>tube</b> {{with a tiny}} camera known as an endoscope attached through the mouth to examine the esophagus and stomach. In this way, evidence of esophageal inflammation can be detected, and biopsies taken if necessary. Since an endoscopy allows a doctor to visually inspect the upper digestive tract the procedure may help identify any additional damage to the tract {{that may not have}} been detected otherwise.|$|E

50|$|Another one is Endoscopic surgery. This less {{invasive}} form {{of surgery}} isn't {{an option for}} everyone. But in certain cases, the surgeon may use a <b>lighted</b> <b>tube</b> (endoscope) inserted through one or two small scalp incisions over the affected suture. The surgeon then opens the suture to enable your baby's brain to grow normally. Endoscopic surgery usually takes about an hour, causes less swelling and blood loss, and shortens the hospital stay, often to one day after surgery.|$|E
50|$|Generally, {{a biopsy}} {{is needed to}} confirm a {{diagnosis}} of malignant mesothelioma. A doctor removes a sample of tissue for examination under a microscope by a pathologist. A biopsy may be done in different ways, depending on where the abnormal area is located. If the cancer is in the chest, the doctor may perform a thoracoscopy. In this procedure, the doctor makes a small cut through the chest wall and puts a thin, <b>lighted</b> <b>tube</b> called a thoracoscope into the chest between two ribs. Thoracoscopy allows the doctor to look inside the chest and obtain tissue samples. Alternatively, the chest surgeon might directly open the chest (thoracotomy). If the cancer is in the abdomen, the doctor may perform a laparoscopy. To obtain tissue for examination, the doctor makes a small incision in the abdomen and inserts a special instrument into the abdominal cavity. If these procedures do not yield enough tissue, an open surgical procedure may be necessary.|$|E
40|$|Colonic {{cancer is}} the second {{leading cause of death}} among cancers in the Western world. Early {{detection}} greatly improves the chances of survival. Colonoscopy is a non-invasive detection method through natural access, making it possible to look inside the colon, take biopsies and remove small polyps that can develop into cancer. Colonoscopy is often experienced as a painful and uncomfortable procedure. A cause for the pain a patient experiences is the buckling of the colonoscope, a long, <b>lighted</b> <b>tube</b> with camera and biopsy canal, that stretches the colonic wall. This buckling occurs because the colonoscope has to take difficult bends while being pushed from behind. In order to prevent this buckling, a device is presented that pulls the colonoscope from the front. The presented design is that of a device that uses a rolling mucoadhesive films to create friction with the colonic surface to pull itself forward into the colon. A demonstration model was constructed and tested in vitro in the colon of a pig. Tests showed {{that it is possible to}} move a device through the colon by using a rolling mucoadhesive films. It can be concluded that the presented design is a step forward to come to an improved design of a colonoscope that is not only pushed from behind but also pulled forward from the front.

50|$|Molded plastic <b>light</b> <b>tubes</b> are {{commonly}} used in the electronics industry to direct illumination from LEDs on a circuit board to indicator symbols or buttons. These <b>light</b> <b>tubes</b> typically take on a highly complex shape that uses either gentle curving bends as in an optic fiber or have sharp prismatic folds which reflect off the angled corners. Multiple <b>light</b> <b>tubes</b> are often molded from {{a single piece of}} plastic, permitting easy device assembly since the long thin <b>light</b> <b>tubes</b> are all part of a single rigid component that snaps into place.|$|R
