5|$|After a {{prolonged}} power struggle, Khrushchev was finally ousted {{from his post}} as First Secretary in October 1964, charged with the failure of his reforms, his obsessive re-organizations of the Party and Government apparatus, his disregard for Party and Government institutions, and his one-man domineering <b>leadership</b> style. The Presidium (Politburo), the Central Committee and other important Party–Government bodies had grown tired of Khrushchev's repeated violations of established Party principles. The Soviet <b>leadership</b> also believed that his individualistic <b>leadership</b> style ran contrary to the ideal collective <b>leadership.</b> Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin succeeded Khrushchev in his posts as First Secretary and Premier respectively, and Mikhail Suslov, Andrei Kirilenko, and Anastas Mikoyan (replaced in 1965 by Nikolai Podgorny), were also given prominence in the new <b>leadership.</b> Together they formed a functional collective <b>leadership.</b>|$|E

5|$|Design {{managers}} often {{operate in}} the area of design leadership; however, design management and design <b>leadership</b> are interdependent rather than interchangeable. Like management and <b>leadership,</b> they differ in their objectives, achievements of objectives, accomplishments, and outcomes. Design <b>leadership</b> leads from creation of a vision to changes, innovations, and implementation of creative solutions. It stimulates communication and collaboration through motivation, sets ambitions, and points out future directions to achieve long-term objectives. In contrast, design management is reactive and responds to a given business situation by using specific skills, tools, methods, and techniques. Design management requires design <b>leadership</b> to know where to go and design <b>leadership</b> requires design management to know how to get there.|$|E
