25|$|Milk {{is added}} {{in various forms}} to an espresso: steamed milk makes a caffè <b>latte,</b> equal parts steamed milk and milk froth make a cappuccino, and a dollop of hot foamed milk on top creates a caffè macchiato. A flat white is {{prepared}} by adding steamed hot milk (microfoam) to espresso so that the flavour is brought out and the texture is unusually velvety. It has less milk than a <b>latte</b> but both are varieties of coffee to which the milk can be added {{in such a way}} as to create a decorative surface pattern. Such effects are known as <b>latte</b> art.|$|E
