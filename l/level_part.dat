25|$|Construction {{has started}} on the road <b>level</b> <b>part</b> between station K1 and K5 so far. This should be a tram based LRT and {{although}} the official Transportation Department claims that this line is still under planning, work has been ongoing since April 2016. From station K6 to K9 the tracks will be elevated. The initial work between station K6 and K7 have been done and is clearly visible on Google maps. It's passing through a cemetery and will be going across Ankang Road. It's currently unknown when this line is planned to open, but as it connects to station Y7 on the circular line (also known as line 6) which is still under construction, it's unlikely to open until that line is finished.|$|E
500|$|The {{rectangular}} bailey forms a courtyard, the <b>level</b> <b>part</b> {{of which}} is called the Castle Green. When first built, the bailey was protected by earth ramparts, until a later stone curtain wall was built around it, protected by at least three mural towers, the foundations of some of which still survive. Much of the wall, including the south-eastern tower–called the Watch or Witch Tower–has been destroyed, although around a stretch [...] long survives on the south-west side. The foundations of various, mostly 13th-century buildings excavated during the 20th century can be seen within the bailey, including the great hall, [...] across; a long narrow hall, possibly used as a courtroom; and a large kitchen. A Victorian cottage is positioned by the south gatehouse, probably {{on the site of}} the earl's hall and chamber.|$|E

2500|$|Mt. Moriah had {{a plateau}} at the {{northern}} end, and steeply declined on the southern slope. It was Herod's plan that the entire mountain {{be turned into a}} giant square platform. The Temple Mount was originally intended to be 1600 feet wide by 900 feet broad by 9 stories high, with walls up to 16 feet thick, but had never been finished. To complete it, a trench was dug around the mountain, and huge stone [...] "bricks" [...] were laid. [...] Some of these weighed well over 100 tons, the largest measuring 44.6 feet by 11 feet by 16.5 feet and weighing approximately 567 to 628 tons, while most were in the range of 2.5 by 3.5 by 15 feet (approximately 28 tons). King Herod had architects from Greece, Rome and Egypt plan the construction. The blocks were presumably quarried by using pickaxes to create channels. Then they hammered in wooden beams and flushed them with water to force them out. Once they were removed, they were carved into precise squares and numbered at the quarry to show where they would be installed. The final carving would have been done by using harder stones to grind or chisel them to create precise joints. They would have been transported using oxen and specialized carts. Since the quarry was uphill from the temple they had gravity on their side but care needed to be taken to control the descent. Final installation would have been done using pulleys or cranes. Roman pulleys and cranes weren't strong enough to lift the blocks alone so they may have used multiple cranes and levers to position them. As the mountainside began to rise, the western side was carved away to a vertical wall and bricks were carved to create a virtual continuation of the brick face, which was continued for a while until the northern slope reached ground <b>level.</b> <b>Part</b> of the Antonian hill to the north of Moriah was annexed to the complex and the area between was filled up with landfill.|$|E

60|$|Being now so {{near their}} journey's end, the winged horse {{gradually}} descended with his rider; {{and they took}} advantage of some clouds that were floating over the mountain-tops, in order to conceal themselves.
