He's always so positive and so sure and he never wants to repeat himself. Like, 'How can I make something different and new and not like anything else?' I look back at that whole record, and I think, 'Wow I wish there was more time to do more singles.' You only get {{so many things that}} people hear.|$|E

Keef's {{contributions to the}} track were praised by musician Lou Reed, with Reed stating, [...] "'Hold My Liquor' is just heartbreaking, and particularly coming from where it's coming from – <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> incredibly poignant hook from a tough guy like Chief Keef, wow." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2012 {{interview}} with NME magazine, frontman Alex Turner cited John Lennon {{as a major}} influence lyrically. When speaking about Lennon, Turner said; [...] "I remember when I first started writing songs, and writing lyrics, I {{really wanted to be}} able to write an [...] "I Am the Walrus" [...] type song, and I found it very difficult. You <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> and it sounds like it's all nonsense, but it's difficult to write that sort of thing and make it compelling. Lennon definitely had a knack for that".|$|E

500|$|When Dylan played Shelton the song, {{shortly after}} {{recording}} it, he claimed, [...] "This {{is the best}} song I've ever written." [...] Around the same time, Dylan enthused to journalist Jules Siegel, [...] "Just <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>that!</b> That's old-time religious carnival music!" [...] However, in 1969, Dylan confessed to Rolling Stones editor, Jann Wenner, [...] "I just sat down at a table and started writing... And I just got carried away with the whole thing... I just started writing and I couldn't stop. After a period of time, I forgot {{what it was all}} about, and I started trying {{to get back to the}} beginning [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Shira is {{frequently}} shown playing the accordion, which Hadas Yaron {{did not know}} how to play. She described it as a [...] "very difficult instrument" [...] and stated, [...] "There was so much noise in [...] It was like rrrrrrnnnnngh , I was faking the melody and it was ugly, very weird stuff. I had to really switch this button [...] like don't listen to it and feel what you’'re feeling. It took a while because at the beginning, I was very aware of playing this horrible melody, if you could call it a melody, and I knew I had to feel something. It took a few takes because I thought, 'oh, how could [...] <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>that?</b> The cinematographer!' It took a while to ignore that and just be in the moment." ...|$|E
500|$|Kim Manners called [...] "Grotesque" [...] his {{favorite}} third-season episode and praised David Duchovny's performance on this episode, saying [...] "Duchovny drove himself, {{and he was}} brilliant in that show." [...] Manners also said of the episode: [...] "I think 'Grotesque' is a frightening show. I {{think it is a}} disturbing show, and I think that's why—for me—it's such a good show. We pulled it off making the viewer feel uneasy. I even found it a difficult show to watch. Yeah, it was a pretty dark hour of television and I would like to do more of those." [...] In order to get a proper feel for the episode, Manners listened to the music from the 1990 film Jacob's Ladder until his wife [...] "finally asked, 'Do we have to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> (bleeping) CD again?'" [...] Manners also theorized that the episode may have been the template for the show Millennium, which premiered on Fox the following television season.|$|E

500|$|On October 24, {{the band}} {{mentioned}} {{that they had}} nearly finishing recording the album and would start the mixing process shortly afterwards. On November 6, the band announced they were [...] "still putting the finshing [...] touches on the album". The recordings were mixed by Tom Lord-Alge with Fernio Hernandez at South Beach Studios in Miami, Florida. Ted Jensen mastered the recordings at Sterling Sound in New York City. In retrospect, Lazzara called Kahne [...] "a good producer," [...] but didn't think he was [...] "the right fit" [...] for the group. He added that what the group aimed to accomplish was [...] "just different than what he had envisioned both sonically and {{with all of that}} stuff". Reyes said he was [...] "pre-warned about working with him and I didn't <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>that.</b> ... It was kind of very blank. I think I put my guitar tracks on and then I flew back home and that was it." ...|$|E
500|$|Carey wrote [...] "Mine Again" [...] {{alongside}} producer James Poyser. The ballad has {{electronic keyboard}} notes, a rhythmic vinyl sound, and melodies from gospel and R genres. [...] "Stay the Night" [...] {{was produced by}} Carey and Kanye West, and samples a piano loop from Ramsey Lewis's 1971 cover version of [...] "Betcha by Golly, Wow". In the lyrics, the protagonist faces the dilemma of spending the night with an ex-lover, although he is in another relationship. [...] "Get Your Number" [...] samples the hook from British band Imagination's 1982 single [...] "Just an Illusion", and derives its production from [...] "'80s-esque synthesizers" [...] and computerized musical instruments. Lawrence Ferber from the Windy City Times described [...] "Shake It Off" [...] as a [...] "playful approach to bitterness—and, more specifically, a cheatin' bad apple", with lyrics such as [...] "I gotta shake you off / Just like a Calgon commercial". In an interview with Ferber, Carey described the track as her favorite from The Emancipation of Mimi: [...] "'Shake It Off' can apply to anything. Whatever personal dramas we go through, put that song on and you lose the anxiety or intensity of the moment. I'll <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> song when I've {{just come out of}} an annoying meeting. I gotta shake this off." [...] Editor Jon Pareles from The New York Times felt that the album follows a formula that was most apparent on [...] "Shake It Off": [...] "On this album, the verses stay in a narrow range, the choruses glide higher, and at the ends of some songs, Ms. Carey gives herself a few of her old sky-high notes as a background flourish." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Shake It Off" [...] was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews from music critics. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine picked [...] "Shake It Off" [...] as a top pick from the album. Michael Paoletta, writing for Billboard, gave the song a positive review, complimenting its lyrics, production and Carey's vocals. He concluded his review with his assurance that the song would be a success, writing [...] "After 'We Belong Together' {{brought her back to}} radio big time, 'Shake It Off' will take Carey's good fortune to the next step." [...] Some critics compared the song heavily to Usher's material from his 2004 album, Confessions. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine wrote [...] "Mariah too heavily bites on the styles of her successors: Usher by way of Dupri on 'Shake It Off'," [...] while Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music UK said the song was [...] "Usher-lite". Lawrence Ferber from the Windy City Times described [...] "Shake It Off" [...] as a [...] "standout" [...] track from the album. When discussing the track with Ferber, Carey described the song as her favorite from The Emancipation of Mimi: [...] "Shake it off can apply to anything. Whatever personal dramas we go through, put that song on and you lose the anxiety or intensity of the moment. I'll <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> song when I've just come out of an annoying meeting. I gotta shake this off." [...] While Todd Burns from Stylus Magazine described it as [...] "sultry", a writer from the Fort Worth Star-Telegram called it [...] "lyrically crude" [...] and [...] "ghetto". Similarly, The Michigan Dailys Chris Gaerig criticized Carey's [...] "airy vocals" [...] and wrote [...] "Carey sounds like a 13-year-old boy going through puberty, singing love songs to a grade school crush." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert {{praised the}} narration. [...] "These words sounded {{verbatim}} {{to me from}} No Country for Old Men, the novel by Cormac McCarthy", he said. [...] "But I find they are not quite. And their impact has been improved upon in the delivery. When I get the DVD of this film, I will <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> stretch of narration several times; Jones delivers it with a vocal precision and contained emotion that is extraordinary, and it sets up the entire film." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tinderbox {{would be}} later hailed by Jean-Benoît Dunckel of Air. He {{selected}} Tinderbox for his [...] "5 albums forever" [...] list, saying, [...] "They played so well together; I saw them in concert and I never forgot that moment". Billy Howerdel of A Perfect Circle rated {{it as his}} all-time favourite album [...] Howerdel described it as [...] "one of the spookiest records I've ever heard. Some of the songs on there have such a dense atmosphere. Sometimes when I'm stuck, I'll <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>that.</b> It's like sometimes when you have no inspiration and {{you go out and}} look at the moon, that's kind of what that record is for me". Jenny Lee Lindberg [...] of Warpaint cited the band among her influences, as well as the song [...] "Umbrella", initially included in the track listing of the 1986 CD version. She said: [...] "This is a song that my husband and I bonded over – we’d definitely heard it individually before, but one day we were just playing the album and that song stopped us in our tracks… played it on repeat for the whole night. I understand why some people can hear a little Siouxsie in what we do." ...|$|E
2500|$|In addition, {{while he}} was the Vatican's chief astronomer, Fr. George Coyne, issued a {{statement}} on 18 November 2005 saying that [...] "Intelligent design isn't science even though it pretends to be. If you want to teach it in schools, intelligent design should be taught when religion or cultural history is taught, not science." [...] Cardinal Paul Poupard added that [...] "the faithful have the obligation to <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> which secular modern science has to offer, just as we ask that knowledge of the faith be taken in consideration as an expert voice in humanity." [...] He also warned of the permanent lesson we have learned from the Galileo affair, and that [...] "we also know the dangers of a religion that severs its links with reason and becomes prey to fundamentalism." [...] Fiorenzo Facchini, professor of evolutionary biology at the University of Bologna, called intelligent design unscientific, and wrote in the January 16–17, 2006 edition L'Osservatore Romano: [...] "But it is not correct from a methodological point of view to stray {{from the field of}} science while pretending to do science.... It only creates confusion between the scientific plane and those that are philosophical or religious." [...] Kenneth R. Miller is another prominent Catholic scientist widely known for opposing Young Earth Creationism and Intelligent Design. He writes, concerning Emeritus pope Benedict XVI, that [...] "The Holy Father's concerns are not with evolution per se, but with how evolution is to be understood in our modern world. Biological evolution fits neatly into a traditional Catholic understanding of how contingent natural processes can be seen as part of God's plan...a careful reading suggests that the new pope will give quarter neither to the enemies of spirituality nor the enemies of evolutionary science. And that's exactly as it should be." ...|$|E
