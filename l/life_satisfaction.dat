5|$|A {{follow-up}} study conducted 14 {{months after the}} original psilocybin session confirmed that participants continued to attribute deep personal meaning to the experience. Almost one-third of the subjects reported that the experience was the single most meaningful or spiritually significant event of their lives, and over two-thirds reported it among their five most spiritually significant events. About two-thirds indicated that the experience increased their sense of well-being or <b>life</b> <b>satisfaction.</b> Even after 14 months, those who reported mystical experiences scored on average 4 percentage points higher on the personality trait of Openness/Intellect; personality traits are normally stable across the lifespan for adults. Likewise, in a recent (2010) web-based questionnaire study designed to investigate user perceptions of the {{benefits and harms of}} hallucinogenic drug use, 60% of the 503 psilocybin users reported that their use of psilocybin had a long-term positive impact on their sense of well-being.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are also}} {{affected}} by societal expectations, such as notions about masculinity and sexual prowess. Men from some traditional backgrounds may feel performance pressure {{that emphasizes the}} ability to have erections and sexual intercourse. Men who have strong sexual desire but who {{are not able to}} perform sexually may be at increased risk for depression, particularly when they believe strongly in traditional masculine gender norms with sexual function as core to the male identity. Men who strongly believe in these traditional roles may feel sexually inadequate, unmanly, insecure, and less satisfied with life. Since sexual dysfunction has this negative impact on self-esteem, treatment of erectile dysfunction can have a psychological benefit even though it does not help with physical sensation. SCI may necessitate reappraisal and rejection of assumptions about gender norms and sexual function in order to adjust healthily to the disability: those who are able to change the way they think about gender roles may have better <b>life</b> <b>satisfaction</b> and outcomes with rehabilitation. Counseling is helpful in this reassessment process.|$|E
40|$|Administration of {{the same}} Quality of <b>Life</b> Enjoyment and <b>Satisfaction</b> Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q) in major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD) and in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) before and after treatment allowed us to compare quality of <b>life</b> enjoyment and <b>satisfaction</b> in these two disorders and to compare outcome based on symptoms versus functioning. Q-LES-Q and symptom-specific Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) data from eight randomized, 8 -week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials with escitalopram were used. MDD (n= 1, 140) or GAD (n= 1, 045) patients report a substantial degree of quality of <b>life</b> enjoyment and <b>satisfaction</b> impairment (baseline scores 64 % and 76 % of community norm, respectively). Treatment resulted in statistically and clinically significant improvement in quality of <b>life</b> enjoyment and <b>satisfaction.</b> The improvement was greater in patients treated with escitalopram than with placebo. In MDD, the majority of remitters (MADRS<or= 12) reached 'normal' quality of <b>life</b> enjoyment and <b>satisfaction</b> levels, whereas in GAD, 67 % of remitters (HAMA<or= 7) reached 'normal' quality of <b>life,</b> enjoyment, and <b>satisfaction.</b> A strong correlation between the symptom-specific scales and the Q-LES-Q was observed. These analyses suggest that remission with scores of 6 on the MADRS and 5 on the HAMA correspond with a quality of <b>life</b> enjoyment and <b>satisfaction</b> found in community comparison patients (Q-LES-Q score of 58 +/- 10 %). Treatment with escitalopram results in a significant improvement of quality of <b>life</b> enjoyment and <b>satisfaction</b> in patients with MDD or GAD. Both response and remission in patients with GAD and remission in patients with MDD are correlated with a 'normal' quality of <b>life</b> enjoyment and <b>satisfaction.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|This study aims {{to analyze}} and explain the {{influence}} of spiritual leadership to ethical behavior, quality of work <b>life,</b> job <b>satisfaction,</b> organizational commitment and employee performance. The sample {{in this study was}} 160 employees working at the Bank of North Sillawesi. Structural Equation Modeling was used as a tool of analysis in this study. The results showed that spiritual leadership had significant influence directly to ethical behavior, but no significant effect on the quality of work <b>life,</b> job <b>satisfaction,</b> organizational commitment and employee performance. Ethical behavior has a direct significant effect on the quality of working <b>life,</b> job <b>satisfaction,</b> and organizational commitment, and indirectly significant effect on employee performance.

40|$|In this study, the {{relationship}} between (a) doctor's and patients' communication and (b) doctors' patient-centredness during the oncological consultation and patients' quality of <b>life</b> and <b>satisfaction</b> was examined. Consultations of 96 consecutive cancer patients were recorded and content analysed {{by means of the}} Roter Interaction Analysis System. Data collection (mailed questionnaires) took place after 1 week and after 3 months. Oncologists' behaviours were unrelated to patients' quality of life. Their socio-emotional behaviours related to both patients' visit-specific and global satisfaction. Patients' behaviour related to both patient outcomes although mostly to satisfaction. Multiple regression analyses showed that patients' quality of <b>life</b> and <b>satisfaction</b> were most clearly predicted by the affective quality of the consultation. Surprisingly, oncologists' patient-centredness was negatively related to patients' global satisfaction after 3 months.

40|$|Abstract] Background. Due {{to recent}} {{improvements}} in colorectal cancer survival, patient-reported outcomes, including health-related quality of <b>life</b> and <b>satisfaction</b> with care, have become well-established endpoints {{to determine the}} impact of the disease on the lives of patients. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine prospectively, in a cohort of colorectal cancer incident cases: a) health-related quality of <b>life,</b> b) <b>satisfaction</b> with hospital-based care, and c) functional status. A secondary objective is to determine whether diagnostic/therapeutic delay influence quality of <b>life</b> or patients’ <b>satisfaction</b> levels. Methods/design. Single-centre prospective follow-up study of colorectal cancer patients diagnosed during the period 2011 – 2012 (n[*]=[*] 375). This project was approved by the corresponding ethics review board, and informed consent is obtained from each patient. After diagnosis, patients are interviewed by a trained nurse, obtaining information on sociodemographic characteristics, family history of cancer, first symptoms, symptom perception and reaction to early symptoms. Quality of life is assessed with the EORTC QLQ-C 30 and QLQ- CR 29 questionnaires, and patients’ satisfaction with care is determined using the EORTC IN-PATSAT 32. Functional status is measured with the Karnofsky Performance Status Scale. Clinical records are also reviewed to collect information on comorbidity, tumour characteristics, treatment, hospital consultations and exploratory procedures. Symptoms-to-diagnosis interval is defined as the time from the date of first symptoms until the cytohistological confirmation of cancer. Treatment delay is defined as the time between diagnosis and surgical treatment. All the patients will be followed-up for a maximum of 2 years. For survivors, assessments will be re-evaluated at one and two years after the diagnosis. Multiple linear/logistic regression models will be used to identify variables associated with the patients’ functional status, quality of <b>life</b> and <b>satisfaction</b> with care score. Changes in quality of life over time will be analysed with linear mixed-effects regression models. Discussion. The results will provide a deeper understanding of the impact of colorectal cancer from a more patient-centred approach, allowing us to identify groups of patients in need of additional attention, as well as areas for improvement. Special attention will be given to the relationship between diagnostic/therapeutic delay and patients’ quality of <b>life</b> and <b>satisfaction</b> with the care received.

25|$|There are two {{components}} of SWB. One is Affective Balance {{and the other}} is <b>Life</b> <b>Satisfaction.</b> An individual's scores on the two measures are summed to produce a total SWB score. In some cases, these scores are kept separate.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of domains that are thought to {{contribute}} to subjective well-being. In a study by Hribernik and Mussap (2010), leisure satisfaction was found to predict unique variance in <b>life</b> <b>satisfaction,</b> supporting its inclusion as a distinct life domain contributing to subjective well-being. Additionally, relationship status interacted with age group and gender on differences in leisure satisfaction. The relationship between leisure satisfaction and <b>life</b> <b>satisfaction,</b> however, was reduced when considering the impact of core affect (underlying mood state). This suggests that leisure satisfaction may primarily be influenced by an individual's subjective well-being level as represented by core affect. This has implications for possible limitations in the extent to which leisure satisfaction may be improved beyond pre-existing levels of well-being and mood in individuals.|$|E

25|$|The Tripartite {{model of}} {{subjective}} well-being (SWB) {{is a theory}} developed by Diener which describes how people experience {{the quality of their}} lives and includes both emotional reactions and cognitive judgments. Psychologists have defined happiness as a combination of <b>life</b> <b>satisfaction</b> and the relative frequency of positive and negative affect. SWB therefore encompasses moods and emotions as well as evaluations of one's satisfaction with general and specific areas of one's life. Concepts encompassed by SWB include positive and negative affect, happiness, and <b>life</b> <b>satisfaction.</b> Positive psychology is particularly concerned with the study of SWB. SWB tends to be stable over time and is strongly related to personality traits.
