5|$|The Berne Convention for the Protection of <b>Literary</b> <b>and</b> <b>Artistic</b> <b>Works</b> has {{protected}} the copyrights on literary, scientific, and artistic works since 1886. Article 9 of the Convention states that: Authors of <b>literary</b> <b>and</b> <b>artistic</b> <b>works</b> protected by this Convention shall have the exclusive right of authorising {{the reproduction of}} these works, {{in any manner or}} form.... Any sound or visual recording shall be considered as a reproduction {{for the purposes of this}} Convention. This means a composer has performing rights and control over how derivative works should be used, and the rights are retained at least 50 years after death, or even longer. Even if a song is a traditional arrangement in the public domain, performing rights can still be violated. Where they exist, performers rights may have a shorter duration than full copyright; for example, the Rome Convention sets a minimum term of twenty years after the performance. This created a market for bootleg CDs in the late 1980s, containing 1960s recordings.|$|E

The unique conception of Petar Milosavljević, reached by metacritical relation toward previous conception, is that <b>literary</b> <b>and</b> <b>artistic</b> <b>work</b> is a unity of text and context. The author expanded his conception in the book Theory of Belletristic, in the chapter The Eventuality of a Belletristic Text, where <b>literary</b> <b>and</b> <b>artistic</b> <b>work</b> as a unity of text and context should also be considered as an event with its own structure and elements - the constituent facts of text and context. ...|$|R

500|$|Copyright law, {{throughout}} its history, {{has sought to}} protect not only the financial interests of the authors but also their personality rights. Evolving from the French droit moral, moral rights protect the personality and reputation of the copyrighted work's author. Under the Berne Convention for the Protection of <b>Literary</b> <b>and</b> <b>Artistic</b> <b>Works,</b> providing protection for moral rights is a requisite part of member states' legal systems. The actual rights provided vary from nation to nation; French law treats moral rights as supreme and perpetual, and German law gives both moral and economic rights the same weighting, but the British legal system has traditionally [...] "manifested a certain scepticism towards claims that authors deserve special protection in law", and until the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, there was little protection. Even {{with the passage of}} the 1988 Act, academics still debate over how far the rights should go.|$|E
500|$|Australia's first celebrity sportsman, Wills {{began to}} fade from public {{consciousness}} within his own lifetime. His dark reputation and suicide, and his links to convictism and frontier violence—sources of cultural cringe—have been posited as reasons for his descent into obscurity. Academic Barry Judd called him [...] "a ghost inhabiting the margins of written history". Coinciding with a revival of interest in Australia's colonial past, Wills has risen [...] "almost to a vogue", and {{is seen as a}} forerunner of today's self-destructive star athletes, some of those qualities that alienated his peers [...] "being less shocking to a generation that likes its heroes flawed". [...] The subject of scholarly, <b>literary</b> <b>and</b> <b>artistic</b> <b>works,</b> his story has been likened to bushranger Ned Kelly's as an epic and quintessentially Australian narrative. After several attempts by different authors since the 1930s, a definitive biography was published in 2008, Greg de Moore's Tom Wills: First Wild Man of Australian Sport.|$|E
500|$|The {{right of}} {{integrity}} protects authors from having their copyrighted works altered {{in such a}} fashion as to constitute a [...] "distortion" [...] or [...] "mutilation" [...] of the original work, or {{in a way that}} harms the author's reputation or honour. Cases vary as to how the right of integrity should be interpreted, with some judges saying that [...] "distortion" [...] or [...] "mutilation" [...] should be taken {{to be part of the}} wider clause on reputation and honour to avoid subjective decisions, and others interpreting each clause as distinct types of violation. The right to object to false attribution protects individuals from being identified as the authors of works they have not contributed to; unlike the other moral rights it exists only for the individual's lifetime and the 20 years after death, not for the full term of copyright. The United Kingdom's law on moral rights has been criticised for failing to correctly implement the Berne Convention for the Protection of <b>Literary</b> <b>and</b> <b>Artistic</b> <b>Works,</b> and for being unreasonably narrow in the types of creative works it covers.|$|E

The results were published in his Voyage dans la basse et la haute Egypte (Journey in Lower and Upper Egypt), published as two volumes in 1802. The work crowned his reputation both as an archaeologist and as an artist, and sparked the Egyptian Revival in architecture and decorative arts.

She left nearly all her property to the National Trust, including over 4000 acre of land, sixteen farms, cottages and herds of cattle and Herdwick sheep.

5000|$|The name [...] "Romanticism" [...] {{itself was}} derived from the medieval genre chivalric romance. This {{movement}} contributed to the strong influence of such romances, disproportionate to their actual showing among medieval literature, on the image of Middle Ages, such that a knight, a distressed damsel, and a dragon is used to conjure up the time pictorially. The Romantic interest in the medieval can particularly be seen in the illustrations of English poet William Blake and the Ossian cycle published by Scottish poet James Macpherson in 1762, which inspired both Goethe's Götz von Berlichingen (1773), and the young Walter Scott. The latter's Waverley Novels, including Ivanhoe (1819) and Quentin Durward (1823) helped popularise, and shape views of, the medieval era. The same impulse manifested itself in the translation of medieval national epics into modern vernacular languages, including Nibelungenlied (1782) in Germany, The Lay of the Cid (1799) in Spain, Beowulf (1833) in England, The Song of Roland (1837) in France, which were widely read and highly influential on subsequent <b>literary</b> <b>and</b> <b>artistic</b> <b>work.</b>|$|R
