A {{synthesis}} {{study of}} W 2 B 5 powder {{was carried out}} by double self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (D-SHS) from CaWO 4, Mg and B 2 O 3 mixture and followed by HCl leaching methods. In the first stage of SHS reaction, molar composition ratio of CaWO 4 :B 2 O 3 :Mg mixture was selected as 1 : 1 : 8 (SHS- 1) and 1 : 2. 5 : 8 (SHS- 2).

50|$|This is {{achieved}} in practice {{through a process}} called double leaching. The calcine is first leached in a neutral or slightly acidic solution (of sulfuric acid) in order to leach the zinc out of the zinc oxide.

The result of this process is a solid and a liquid; the liquid contains the zinc and is often called leach product; the solid is called leach residue and contains precious metals (usually lead and silver) which are sold as a by-product. There is also iron in the <b>leach</b> <b>product</b> from the strong acid leach, which is removed in an intermediate step, in the form of goethite, jarosite, and haematite.

40|$|The {{effect of}} Fe 2 +/Fe 3 + ratio on {{chalcopyrite}} bacterial and chemical leaching {{has been studied}} by X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. The leaching results indicate a high Fe 2 +/Fe 3 + ratio, which keeps the Eh at a relatively low range (350 - 480 mV vs. Ag/AgCl), can significantly promote the dissolution of chalcopyrite during either bioleaching or chemical leaching. Jarosite was found as a major <b>leaching</b> <b>product</b> that accumulated more rapidly with higher initial Fe 2 +/Fe 3 + ratio and at higher temperature. Elemental sulfur was also found as an intermediate that was effectively eliminated by sulfur-oxidizing bacteria.

The elemental composition confirmed the presence of minerals like Si (1.21  wt%), Al (0.90  wt%) and traces of calcium. On treating the sample with HF solution (40  %), particles of kaolinite and bassanite were extensively removed, showing {{a significant decrease in}} surface brightness (Fig.  13). Chemical leaching thus resulted in morphological changes to the surface by removing the inorganic minerals. The chemical composition indicated that, the surface consists of 98.23  wt% carbon and 1.77  wt% oxygen for sub-bituminous coal (Fig.  13). The elemental percentages of bituminous sample were found to be 81.1 and 18.85  wt%.

40|$|The {{influence}} of oxidation-reduction (redox) pretreatment on the pulverization of Panzhihua ilmenite during hydrochloric acid leaching to obtain synthetic rutile {{was investigated in}} detail. We observed the dissociation of incompact TiO 2 products formed via the dissolution-hydrolysis of Ti ions, which {{was caused by the}} fast dissolution of FeTiO 3 during the leaching process and was the fundamental reason for pulverization for the raw Panzhihua ilmenite. A stirring operation during the acid leaching aggravated the pulverization phenomenon. The formation and consumption of insoluble rutile grains during the redox pretreatment {{played a key role in}} preventing the pulverization of pre-treated ilmenites. The rutile network formed during the pre-oxidation was retained and served as a nucleus for the hydrolyzed product during the successive leaching process, providing the <b>leaching</b> <b>products</b> of the pre-oxidized ilmenite with less hydrolyzed TiO 2, higher mechanical strength, and thus an excellent resistance to pulverization, even with stirred leaching. Because the following weak reduction process (reduction of ferric iron to ferrous state) at relatively low temperatures (e. g., 873 K) did not destroy the rutile network that was formed by the pre-oxidation, it did not change the ability of the pre-oxidation to prevent the pulverization of ilmenite. However, the weak reduction process at high temperatures (e. g. 1023 K) weakened the effect of pre-oxidation because most of the futile grains that were formed by the pre-oxidation were consumed and formed FeTiO 3.

This suggested that the pipeline interior had become a secondary source of Tl contamination, promoting its mineralogical and geochemical study. Rust scales samples taken from several pipeline segments, as well as <b>leaching</b> <b>products</b> obtained from these samples, were investigated through scanning electron microscopy, X-ray fluorescence chemical analyses, inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Thallium-rich rust scales (up to 5. 3 wt% Tl) have been found only in pipeline samples taken downstream the water treatment plant, whereas the sample taken upstream contains much less Tl (~ 90 μgg- 1). The Tl-rich nature of such scales is related to the occurrence of nano- and micro-spherules of Tl 2 O 3 and less abundant nanocrystalline μm-sized encrustations of TlCl. Leaching experiments on Tl-rich rust scales indicate that a fraction of the available Tl is easily dissolved in tap water; X-ray absorption spectroscopy suggests that monovalent thallium occurs in water equilibrated with the rust scales, probably related to the dissolution of TlCl encrustations. Therefore, Tl dissolved as Tl+ only in the water from the Molini di Sant'Anna spring was partially removed through oxidative precipitation of Tl 2 O 3 and precipitation of TlCl. This highlights the critical role played by the addition of chlorine-based oxidants in water treatment plants that could favour the deposition of Tl-rich coatings within the pipelines, giving rise to unexpected secondary sources of contamination...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} related the low {{recovery}} of nickel and cobalt in the Caron roast-leach process {{to the formation}} of less reactive sulfides during roasting and/or the passivation or surface blockage of ferronickel by oxides and/or sulfides. This study examines the different types of reactions and background reagents which may affect the dissolution of nickel and ferronickel alloy in oxygenated NH 3 /NH 4 +/HCO 3 - solutions at 45 °C based on equilibrium constants and measured leach results at a low solid/liquid ratio of 1 g/dm 3. Some of the additives tested in the present study represent interim <b>leach</b> <b>products.</b> Initial <b>leaching</b> rates of nickel during oxygenation of presoaked Fe-Ni alloys decreases with increasing iron mole fraction. The Fe-Ni(45 %) alloy continues to react and dissolve about 90 % Ni over the first 15 - 40 min, depending upon the additives. In contrast, iron leaching reaches a broad maximum of ~ 10 % over 20 - 35 min, or a sharp maximum of 6 % after 5 min in the absence or presence of additives, respectively. This is followed by a decrease in iron extraction to ≤ 2 % after 45 - 60 min due to the precipitation of red/black oxides and sulfides. Direct involvement of S 2 O 32 - and redox mediation by Cu(II) or Co(III) is evident from the enhanced initial rates of nickel leaching from Fe-Ni(45 %) alloy in the order: O 2 /HS - O 2 < O 2 /S 2 O 32 - < O 2 /Co(III) /S 2 O 32 - < O 2 /Cu(II) /S 2 O 32 -. While the added S 2 O 32 - has a detrimental effect on iron leaching, HS- retards the leaching of both iron and nickel from Fe-Ni(45 %) alloy to < 1 %.
