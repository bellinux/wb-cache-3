5|$|Different studies {{generally}} find varying {{values for}} elemental abundances. This is often because spectrographs attached to telescopes do not collect all {{the light from}} objects being observed, instead gathering <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> slit or small aperture. Therefore, different observations may sample {{different parts of the}} nebula.|$|E
5|$|Lloyd's mirror generates {{interference}} fringes {{by combining}} direct <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> source (blue lines) and {{light from the}} source's reflected image (red lines) from a mirror held at grazing incidence. The result is an asymmetrical pattern of fringes. Interestingly, the band of equal path length, nearest the mirror, is dark rather than bright. In 1834, Humphrey Lloyd interpreted this effect as proof that the phase of a front-surface reflected beam is inverted.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Oregon, Mulder and Skinner {{travel to}} the woods, {{equipped}} with lasers for finding the UFO. Noticing a spot where the lasers cease in mid-air, Mulder walks through the force field. He finds and joins a group of abductees, including Billy and Theresa, standing below a pillar of <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> UFO; they are soon accosted by the Bounty Hunter. Mulder is abducted with the group while a stunned Skinner witnesses the UFO's departure.|$|E

5|$|In the {{particular}} {{version of the}} experiment shown here, Hoek used a prism P to disperse <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> slit into a spectrum which passed through a collimator C before entering the apparatus. With the apparatus oriented parallel to the hypothetical aether wind, Hoek expected the light in one circuit to be retarded 7/600mm {{with respect to the}} other. Where this retardation represented an integral number of wavelengths, he expected to see constructive interference; where this retardation represented a half-integral number of wavelengths, he expected to see destructive interference. In the absence of dragging, his expectation was for the observed spectrum to be continuous with the apparatus oriented transversely to the aether wind, and to be banded with the apparatus oriented parallel to the aether wind. His actual experimental results were completely negative.|$|E
5|$|Over time, the Universe and its {{contents}} have evolved; for example, the relative population of quasars and galaxies has changed and space itself has expanded. Due to this expansion, scientists on Earth can observe the <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> galaxy 30 billion light years away even though that light has traveled for only 13 billion years; the very space between them has expanded. This expansion {{is consistent with the}} observation that the light from distant galaxies has been redshifted; the photons emitted have been stretched to longer wavelengths and lower frequency during their journey. Analyses of Type Ia supernovae indicate that the spatial expansion is accelerating.|$|E
5|$|Helium was {{discovered}} in 1868 by French astronomer Pierre Janssen, who first detected the substance as an unknown yellow spectral line signature in <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> solar eclipse. In 1903, large reserves of helium {{were found in the}} natural gas fields of the United States, which is by far the largest supplier of the gas. The substance is used in cryogenics, in deep-sea breathing systems, to cool superconducting magnets, in helium dating, for inflating balloons, for providing lift in airships, and as a protective gas for industrial uses such as arc welding and growing silicon wafers. Inhaling a small volume of the gas temporarily changes the timbre and quality of the human voice. The behavior of liquid helium-4's two fluid phases, helium I and helium II, is important to researchers studying quantum mechanics and the phenomenon of superfluidity in particular, and to those looking at the effects that temperatures near absolute zero have on matter, such as with superconductivity.|$|E

5|$|The Twyman–Green {{interferometer}}, {{invented by}} Twyman and Green in 1916, is {{a variant of}} the Michelson interferometer widely used to test optical components. The basic characteristics distinguishing it from the Michelson configuration are the use of a monochromatic point light source and a collimator. It {{is interesting to note that}} Michelson (1918) criticized the Twyman-Green configuration as being unsuitable for the testing of large optical components, since the light sources available at the time had limited coherence length. Michelson pointed out that constraints on geometry forced by limited coherence length required the use of a reference mirror of equal size to the test mirror, making the Twyman-Green impractical for many purposes. Decades later, the advent of laser light sources answered Michelson's objections. (A Twyman-Green interferometer using a laser light source and unequal path length is known as a Laser Unequal Path Interferometer, or LUPI.) Fig.14 illustrates a Twyman-Green interferometer set up to test a lens. <b>Light</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> monochromatic point source is expanded by a diverging lens (not shown), then is collimated into a parallel beam. A convex spherical mirror is positioned so that its center of curvature coincides with the focus of the lens being tested. The emergent beam is recorded by an imaging system for analysis.|$|E

5|$|Masaccio's use {{of light}} was also revolutionary.

25|$|French {{physicist}} and engineer Augustin-Jean Fresnel developed the multi-part Fresnel lens {{for use in}} lighthouses. His design allowed {{for the construction of}} lenses of large aperture and short focal length, without the mass and volume of material that would be required by a lens of conventional design. A Fresnel lens can be made much thinner than a comparable conventional lens, in some cases taking the form of a flat sheet. A Fresnel lens can also capture more oblique <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> light source, thus allowing the <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> lighthouse equipped with one, to be visible over greater distances.|$|E
