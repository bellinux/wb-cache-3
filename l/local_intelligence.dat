25|$|Wellington aimed {{his main}} assault {{at the lower}} Bidasoa, while sending {{additional}} troops to attack Soult's center. Believing his coastal sector secure, Soult held the right flank with a relatively weak force while concentrating most of his strength on his left flank in the mountains. However, the British general obtained <b>local</b> <b>intelligence</b> that indicated that water levels on the lower river were {{much lower than the}} French suspected. After careful planning, Wellington launched a surprise assault which easily overran the French left flank defenses. In the center, his army also won through the French defenses, though his Spanish allies were repulsed in one attack. At the beginning of the fighting, Soult realized that his left flank was in no danger, {{but it was too late}} to reinforce his positions on the right. Some French generals were shocked at how poorly their soldiers fought.|$|E
2500|$|On 27 September 2004, it was {{reported}} that British spies across the Balkans, including a SIS was chief officer in Belgrade and another spy in Sarajevo, were moved or forced to withdraw after they were publicly identified in a number of media reports planted by disgruntled <b>local</b> <b>intelligence</b> services – particularly in Croatia and Serbia. A third individual was branded a British spy in the Balkans and left the office of the High Representative in Bosnia, whilst a further 2 British intelligence officers working in the Zagreb, remained in place despite their cover being blown in the local press. The exposure of the agents across the three capitals has markedly undermined the British intelligence operations in the area, including SIS efforts to capture The Hague's most wanted men, which riled many <b>local</b> <b>intelligence</b> agencies in the Balkans, some of which are suspected of continuing ties to alleged war criminals. They were riled due to MI6 operating [...] "not so much a spy network as a network of influence within Balkan security services and the media," [...] said the director of the International Crisis Group in Serbia and Bosnia, which caused some of them to be [...] "upset". In Serbia, the SIS station chief was forced to leave his post August 2004 after a campaign against him led by country's DB intelligence agency, where his work investigating the 2003 assassination of the reformist prime minister Zoran Djindjic won him few friends.|$|E

2500|$|In 1996, HRW {{concluded}} that [...] "Order 200-05/91 {{laid the groundwork}} for continuing an illegal, covert partnership between the military and paramilitaries and demonstrates that this partnership was promoted by the military high command in violation of [...] Decree 1194, which prohibits such contact. Although the term [...] "paramilitaries" [...] is not used in the order, the document lays out a system similar to the one present under the name of MAS and its military patrons in the Middle Magdalena." [...] HRW argued that the restructuring process solidified linkages between members of the Colombian military and civilian members of paramilitary groups by incorporating them into several of the <b>local</b> <b>intelligence</b> networks and by cooperating with their activities. For HRW, the resulting situation allowed the Colombian government and military to plausibly deny links or responsibility for human rights abuses committed by members or associates of these networks. HRW considered that the intelligence networks created by the U.S. reorganization appeared to have increased violence, citing massacres in Barrancabermeja as an example.|$|E

[...] This sector {{was under the}} overall command of Lieutenant-Colonel Aarne Sihvo and consisted of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Karelian Regiments totaling some 7000 troops. [...] The Red forces had failed to make any substantial gains against Sihvo's energetic defense so they enacted a change in their tactics. [...] The Reds planned to use the Petrograd railway, that remained under their control, to transport approximately 3000 reinforcements from Petrograd to Rautu. [...] The reinforcements would then be used to turn Sihvo's left flank by crossing the Vuoksijoki River at Kiviniemi. [...] Fortunately for the White Finns, <b>local</b> <b>intelligence</b> {{picked up on the}} Red's intentions and alerted the local commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Georg Yrjo Elfvengren of the 1st Karelian Regiment. [...] Elfvengren deployed 500 troops and destroyed two rail bridges and one water tower south of the frontier. [...] However, an attack against the Raasuli rail station failed in large part due to the Reds deploying an armored train. [...] This train traveled frequently between Raasuli and Rautu rail stations carrying supplies to the isolated Rautu station. [...] Elfvengren now called for reinforcements. [...] On 30 March, Captain Oesch was ordered to the Karelian front with his newly formed 8th Jaeger Battalion in support of Elfvengren's operations.|$|E

The main problem that occurred in Lake Limboto is extensive sedimentation and reduction of the lake area. When these issues are not resolved well, the Lake Limboto would bring flood problems and local environment extinction. This research is conducted for obtaining strategic countermeasure for lake age elongation and conservation against sedimentation problems. The methodologies are literature studies, field investigations, field measurements, and collecting of community's aspirations (<b>local</b> <b>intelligences).</b> The recent Limboto Lake Countermeasure Plan should be enhanced by considering original natural function of the lake as flood inundation basin.
