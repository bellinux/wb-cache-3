50|$|The {{escape wheel}} has {{two sets of}} teeth (hence the name 'duplex'); long locking teeth project {{from the side of}} the wheel, and short impulse teeth stick up axially from the top. The cycle starts with a <b>locking</b> <b>tooth</b> resting against the ruby disk. As the balance wheel swings {{counterclockwise}} through its center position, the notch in the ruby disk releases the tooth. As the escape wheel turns, the pallet is in just the right position to receive a push from an impulse tooth. Then the next <b>locking</b> <b>tooth</b> drops onto the ruby roller and stays there while the balance wheel completes its cycle and swings back clockwise (CW), and the process repeats. During the CW swing, the impulse tooth falls momentarily into the ruby roller notch again, but isn't released.|$|E

50|$|Breguet {{realised}} {{that this}} problem (more serious {{at the time}} because of the rather poorer oils then available) could be removed {{and many of the}} advantages of the detent escapement retained if an impulse were given in both directions of the balance. In order to do this he geared two escape wheels together, one escape wheel driven by the fourth wheel of the wheel train, which in turn was geared to and drives a second escape wheel. A pivoted detent swings freely between them and locks each escape wheel in turn on a coaxial set of <b>locking</b> <b>teeth.</b>|$|R
50|$|Silvery mole-rats are {{territorial}} {{and fairly}} aggressive, driving off other mole-rats. When cornered, they adopt a defensive stance with head thrown back and incisors exposed.

Courtship can be quite vocal and is initiated by the male, which follows the female about, sniffing at her genital region. When he is accepted, they face each other and <b>lock</b> <b>teeth</b> or nibble each other gently with their elongated incisors before copulating. The gestation period is between 87 and 101 days, and the litter size is usually between two and five.|$|R
40|$|Here we {{describe}} an unusual trauma case. A recently erupted permanent upper-right incisor sustained a lateral luxation when a 5 -year-old girl on a playground climbing net dropped off, catching the right upper incisor in the net. The tooth was laterally luxated in vestibular direction, {{and no other}} signs of injury occurred. A dental practitioner could not reposition the bony <b>locked</b> <b>tooth.</b> Four days later, the girl came to our clinic, and we performed an incomplete repositioning of the tooth and made a flexible splint. Controls were made at 1, 6, and 12 weeks and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months later. The 24 -month follow-up clinical examination revealed the patient to be asymptomatic and the tooth to be completely functional, and the recall radiograph showed further apical root growth. The implications of a late incomplete reposition of laterally luxated permanent teeth with immature apices are discussed...|$|R

60|$|Though {{the fire}} of her past fever had raged again through her veins, and though startling visions of the murders at Aquileia had flashed before her mind as the wild {{lightning}} before her eyes, she had traced {{her way through the}} suburbs and along the high-road, and down the little path to the farm-house gate, without straying, without hesitating. Regardless of the darkness and the storm, she had prowled about the house, had raised the latch, had waited for a loud peal of thunder ere she passed the door, and had stolen shadow-like into the darkest corner of the room, with a patience and a determination that nothing could disturb. And now, when she stood at the goal of her worst wishes, even now, when she looked down upon the two beings by whom she had been thwarted and deceived, her fierce self-possession did not desert her; her lips quivered over her <b>locked</b> <b>teeth,</b> her bosom heaved beneath her drenched garments, but neither sighs nor curses, not even a smile of triumph or a movement of anger escaped her.|$|R

50|$|After {{the exit}} <b>tooth</b> <b>locks,</b> the balance wheel rotates anti-clockwise, free of {{interference}} from the escapement until the balance spring pulls it back clockwise, and the impulse pin re-enters the fork. This will unlock the escapement, releasing the escape wheel {{so that the}} exit tooth can slide over the impulse plane of the exit pallet, which transfers a clockwise impulse to the balance wheel's impulse pin via the lever fork, while pushing the lever up against the left banking pin. The escape wheel drops again until the entrance <b>tooth</b> <b>locks</b> on the entrance pallet now being {{held in place by}} the left banking pin via the lever.

In the church, where we had wandered photographing, we were startled by a sudden piercing outcry. The scene, looking forth from the doors of that great hall of shadow, was unforgettable. The palms, the quaint and scattered houses, the flag of the island streaming from its tall staff, glowed with intolerable sunshine. In the midst two women rolled fighting on the grass. The combatants were the more easy to be distinguished, because the one was stripped to the ridi and the other wore a holoku (sacque) of some lively colour.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} development of a self-referenced optical frequency comb (OFC) based on a Ti:Sa femtosecond (fs) laser, to be employed in frequency comparisons between a strontium optical lattice clock and other frequency references, both in the radio-frequency (RF) and in the optical domain. The Ti:Sa mode-locked laser, which employs external fiber broadening (EB) for the generation of octave-spanning spectrum, has been stabilized by <b>locking</b> an OFC <b>tooth</b> to a clock laser with high spectral purity, operating at 698 nm and resonant with the clock transition $^ 1 $S$_ 0 $-$^ 3 $P$_ 0 $ in neutral strontium atoms. The frequency stability of this EB OFC has been tested both in the RF domain by comparison with a high-quality quartz oscillator slaved to the global positioning system (GPS) signal, and in the optical domain with a second stabilized diode laser at 689 nm slaved at long term to the intercombination transition $^ 1 $S$_ 0 $-$^ 3 $P$_ 1 $ in atomic strontium. We perform a frequency noise and intensity-related dynamics characterization of the free-running fs Ti:Sa EB OFC and implement these results for optimizing the phase [...] lock of the OFC to a Hz-wide 698 nm semiconductor laser. Based on the frequency noise of the beatnote between the clock laser and corresponding EB OFC tooth $f_{b 698 }$ we expect that the short term frequency stability of the 698 nm clock laser is then transferred to each tooth of the octave-spanning EB OFC. Moreover, the noise transfer processes between the pump laser and the Ti:Sa laser have been studied in detail, both comparing the resulting frequency noise of the EB OFC output spectrum with a single-mode Coherent Verdi V 5 and a multi-mode Spectra Physics Millennia Xs 532 nm pump lasers. In particular, in the latter case we demonstrate that the implementation of an additional control loop for the stabilization of carrier-envelope offset (CEO) frequency $f_{CEO}$ allowed us to stabilize this signal at mHz level, that is compatible with $f_{CEO}$ stabilization results with the single-mode pump laser case. Moreover, we show that, with our optical standard operated at a wavelength 698 nm the impact of $f_{CEO}$ frequency noise on the frequency noise of any EB OFC tooth is negligible when compared with the frequency noise of the $f_{b 698 }$. Despite the OFCs are used typically for precision frequency measurements, we demonstrate an approach to perform an absolute frequency measurement of unstable frequency by the EB OFC. Most of this thesis is devoted to the EB OFC. However, I also present characteristics and our first stabilization results of the OFC working at quasi octave-spanning regime...|$|R

Osim putem arheoloških nalaza, ovo pitanje se pokušava rasvijetliti i na temelju etnološke literature. This paper {{focuses on}} the custom of {{enclosing}} coins in the graves of the deceased on late mediaeval and early modern cemeteries in northern Croatia. The main problem encountered while studying this custom {{is the lack of}} multidisciplinary research of the cemeteries of the mentioned time period and especially the lack of high quality publications. The discoveries from the graves can mainly be divided into three categories: 1. parts of traditional costumes, 2. jewellery and 3. objects tied to religious beliefs. The last category can further be divided into two groups. One group would consist of devotionals (crosses, rosaries, medallions of saints [...] .) which were relatively frequent in early modern graves and depict the personal religiousness of the deceased within the regular Catholic system. The other group consists of objects which can be linked to superstitious or popular beliefs which were maintained parallel with the official religion. This group of symbolic objects is comprised of scissors, knives, sickles, <b>locks,</b> keys, animal <b>teeth</b> and coins. Regardless of the Christian (mainly Catholic) ban of enclosing contributions in graves, coins can be found in many cemeteries from this time period. Coins are commonly connected to the Greek myth about Haron in archaeological literature. The ethnological data, which is much closer to the observed graves in terms of time and culture, gives a much more diverse range of reasons for the monetary contributions - so the deceased can pay for their house, to pay for peace on Earth, to pay for their space, to prevent them from becoming a vampire, to not return, to not leave empty handed, to be paid out, to pay out for the remaining estate or cattle so the deceased would not pull it with them. The coins also served as a reward for paying for the transport, crossing the river, transport to the island of the Blessed, for paying off space or a house in the other world or so that the deceased can pay off his sins. Within the Christian context, as we can see, money and other objects which are occasionally included get a new purpose and serve as a help to the deceased in the passage from life to death and on their journey through purgatory and renewed life during Judgment Day. Based on the archaeological and ethnological data, we can therefore cite several reasons for enclosing coins in a grave on late mediaeval and early modern graves: 1. coins ended up in the grave by accident. 2. coins were placed in the grave next to the deceased on purpose. In this case, the coins had a symbolic role and served {{for the protection of the}} living from the deceased or for numerous necessities the deceased may have had in the other world. 3. coins served as decoration, they were placed in the grave because they were sewn onto clothing or repurposed for jewellery 4. coins which are the personal ownership of the deceased. They were placed into the grave as part of a sack on a belt or sewn/hidden in the clothing of the deceased. 5. other reasons which cannot be interpreted to date...|$|R

O presente estudo teve como objetivo reportar a eficÃcia clÃnica e a seguranÃa terapÃutica da MepivacaÃna 2 % com Epinefrina 1 : 100. 000 (MEPI-E) e MepivacaÃna 2 % com Norepinefrina 1 : 100. 000 (MEPI-N) em infiltraÃÃo anestÃsica de dentes caninos superiores em voluntÃrios saudÃveis. Realizou-se um estudo do tipo ensaio clÃnico, prospectivo, randomizado, cruzado, triplo cego. Trinta pacientes foram randomizados e receberam 0, 6 mL de ambas as soluÃÃes anestÃsicas, por meio de anestesia {{terminal}} infiltrativa, em caninos superiores. Foi avaliado o grau de dor durante a infiltraÃÃo anestÃsica por meio da escala visual analÃgica de dor (EVA). O tempo de induÃÃo anestÃsica foi mensurado pelo teste elÃtrico pulpar mensurando assim, o tempo necessÃrio para a efetivaÃÃo do bloqueio. Os dentes foram submetidos a testes elÃtricos em ciclos periÃdicos e avaliados por 60 minutos com a finalidade de verificar a eficÃcia anestÃsica em tecido dentÃrio. O teste de picada foi utilizado para mensurar a eficÃcia clÃnica em tecido mole, nos seguintes sÃtios: gengiva inserida vestibular, mucosa alveolar superior, mucosa labial superior e pele. TambÃm foi verificada difusÃo vestÃbulo-palatina da soluÃÃo anestÃsica. PressÃo arterial sistÃlica e diastÃlica, frequÃncia cardÃaca, saturaÃÃo de oxigÃnio e glicemia serviram como parÃmetros sistÃmicos de avaliaÃÃo da seguranÃa terapÃutica. Estabeleceu-se o nÃvel de significÃncia em 0, 05 (5 %), foram utilizados os software GraphPad PrismÂ e o software SPSSÂ. Foram analisados um total de 60 punÃÃes anestÃsicas em 30 voluntÃrios do estudo. O grupo MEPI-N apresentou menor nÃvel de dor e desconforto durante a infiltraÃÃo anestÃsica, com diferenÃa estatisticamente significante (P = 0, 0106) quando comparado ao grupo MEPI-E. 86, 7 % dos pacientes quando anestesiados com MEPI-N se apresentaram negativos ao teste elÃtrico num tempo &# 8804; 30 segundos, contra 43, 3 % do grupo MEPI-E (P = 0, 002). Na avaliaÃÃo da eficÃcia anestÃsica pulpar, resultados estatisticamente significantes foram observados nos tempos de 40, 50 e 60 minutos de avaliaÃÃo (P = 0, 031, P = 0, 021, P = 0, 039 respectivamente) mostrando maior potÃncia ao grupo MEPI-N, na anÃlise da eficÃcia anestÃsica em lÃbio superior nos tempos 30, 35 e 40 minutos (P = 0, 031) a superioridade tambÃm foi atribuÃda a soluÃÃo MEPI-N. NÃo houve diferenÃa estatÃstica na anÃlise intergrupos sob os parÃmetros de seguranÃa terapÃutica. NÃo foi observada significÃncia estatÃstica na anÃlise intergrupo em relaÃÃo aos parÃmetros sistÃmicos. Na anÃlise intragrupo observou-se que a pressÃo arterial sistÃlica e diastÃlica, a frequÃncia cardÃaca foram significantemente menores que a basal para alguns tempos em ambos os grupos. A mÃdia glicÃmica aos 30 minutos foi superior e estatisticamente significante ao basal. Resultados apontam que bloqueios anestÃsicos com MepivacaÃna 2 % com Norepinefrina 1 : 100. 000 sÃo capazes de conferir um melhor padrÃo anestÃsico sem contudo resultar em alteraÃÃes sistÃmicas. Local anesthetics are {{the most}} widely drugs used in dental practice. The present study aimed to report the clinical efficacy and safety of therapeutic Mepivacaine 2 % with Epinephrine 1 : 100, 000 (MEPI-E) and Mepivacaine 2 % with 1 : 100, 000 norepinephrine (MEPI-N) in infiltration anesthesia of upper canine teeth in healthy volunteers. We conducted a clinical trial, prospective, randomized, crossover, triple blind. Thirty patients were randomly and received either 0. 6 ml of both anesthetic solution through terminal infiltrative anesthesia in canines. The degree of pain during anesthetic infiltration was made by visual analog scale of pain (VAE). The induction time was measured by measuring electrical test pulp thus the time required for ensuring the <b>locking.</b> The <b>teeth</b> were subjected to electrical tests in periodic cycles and evaluated by 60 minutes in order to verify the effectiveness of anesthesia in dental tissue. The prick {{test was used to}} measure the clinical efficacy in soft tissue, at the following sites: buccal gingiva, upper alveolar mucosa, superior labial mucosa and skin. We also observed vestibular-palatal diffusion of the anesthetic. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation and blood glucose were used as parameters for assessing the systemic therapeutic safety. Established the significance level of 0. 05 (5 %) were used GraphPad Prism Â and SPSS Â. Were analyzed a total of 60 punctures anesthetic in 30 study volunteers. The MEPI-N group showed lower levels of pain and discomfort during the anesthetic infiltration, which was statistically significant (P = 0. 0106) when compared to the MEPI-E. 86. 7 % when anesthetized with MEPI-N the electric test were negative a time &# 8804; 30 seconds, against 43. 3 % of MEPI group-E (P = 0. 002). In evaluating the anesthetic efficacy pulp, statistically significant results were observed in intervals of 40, 50 and 60 minutes of evaluation (P = 0. 031, P = 0. 021, P = 0. 039 respectively) showing greater power to the MEPI-N group, in analyzing the effectiveness anesthesia in the upper lip at 30, 35 and 40 minutes (P = 0. 031) showed superiority was also attributed to MEPI-N solution. There was no statistical difference between groups in the analysis under the parameters of therapeutic safety. There was no statistical significance in the intergroup analysis in relation to systemic parameters. Intragroup analysis showed that the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate were significantly lower than baseline for some time in both groups. The mean glucose at 30 minutes was higher and statistically significant at baseline. Results indicate that anesthetic blocks with 2 % Mepivacaine with 1 : 100, 000 norepinephrine are able to provide a better standard anesthetic but without result in systemic changes...|$|R
