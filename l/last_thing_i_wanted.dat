[...] Many grunge artists were uncomfortable with their success and the resulting attention it brought. Nirvana's Kurt Cobain told Michael Azerrad, [...] "Famous is the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to be." [...] Pearl Jam also felt the burden of success, with much of the attention falling on frontman Eddie Vedder.|$|E
500|$|Tallahatchie County Sheriff Clarence Strider, who {{initially}} positively identified Till's body {{and stated that}} the case against Milam and Bryant was [...] "pretty good", on September 3 announced his doubts that the body pulled from the Tallahatchie River was that of Till. He speculated that the boy was probably still alive. Strider suggested that the recovered body had been planted by the NAACP: a cadaver stolen by T.R.M.Howard, who colluded to place Till's ring on it. Strider changed his account after comments {{were published in the}} press denigrating the people of Mississippi, later saying, [...] "The <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to do was to defend those peckerwoods. But I just had no choice about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Takei {{declared}} {{it was not}} a decrease on the series profitability that was the reason for its cancellation, but a [...] "fatigue" [...] he had been through because he was no more able to follow his fans' wishes. In the author's opinion, Shaman King was being [...] "normalized" [...] by the desire of his readers with the introduction of typical shōnen aspects and losing its originality. In 2007 he revealed he was planning to end the series with the final he initially envisioned to be published in another Shueisha magazine in {{the end of the year}} or in the beginning of 2008. Eventually the entire series was reprinted in 27 kanzenban volumes with the title Shaman King Kanzen-Ban (or [...] "Perfect Edition"), concluding with the [...] "true ending" [...] to the series. The new series finale was also posted on the official Kanzen-Ban website, in addition to the print editions. The first volume of the Perfect Edition was released on March 4, 2008, with the last (volume 27) being published on April 3, 2009. Five years after the end of the series, when the Shaman King Kanzen-Ban was finished, Takei said, [...] "After making the readers [...] so much for this, the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to do was to disappoint them". He thought the ending was a [...] "huge responsibility". This edition served to make corrections and adjustments and, for Takei, it was something [...] "fun," [...] as it was different from scratch.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2006, Miller {{stated that}} he {{intended}} to make Fury Road and that the film was never going to involve Gibson: [...] "There's a real hope. The <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to do is another Mad Max, but this script came along, and I'm completely carried away with it." [...] The film's screenplay was co-written with cult British comic creator Brendan McCarthy, who also designed many of the new characters and vehicles. Miller again confirmed his intention to make another Mad Max at the 2007 Aurora filmmaker initiative. However, he {{stated that he}} thought Gibson would not be interested in the film because of his age. Heath Ledger was reportedly considered for the lead before his death in 2008. On 5 March 2009, it was announced that an R-rated 3D animated feature film was in pre-production and would be taking much of the plot from Fury Road, although Gibson would not be in the film and Miller was looking for a [...] "different route", a [...] "renaissance" [...] of the franchise. Miller cited director Akira Kurosawa as an inspiration for {{what he wanted to do}} with the franchise. Miller was also developing an action-adventure tie-in video game based on the fourth film, along with God of War II video game designer Cory Barlog. Both projects were expected to take two to two-and-a-half years, according to Miller, with a release date of either 2011 or 2012. Fury Road was going to be produced at Dr. D Studios, a digital art studios founded in 2008 by Miller and Doug Mitchell.|$|E

60|$|I {{remember}} one splendid morning, all blue and silver, {{in the summer}} holidays when I reluctantly tore myself away from the task of doing nothing in particular, {{and put on a}} hat of some sort and picked up a walking-stick, and put six very bright-coloured chalks in my pocket. I then went into the kitchen (which, {{along with the rest of}} the house, belonged to a very square and sensible old woman in a Sussex village), and asked the owner and occupant of the kitchen if she had any brown paper. She had a great deal; in fact, she had too much; and she mistook the purpose and the rationale of the existence of brown paper. She seemed to have an idea that if a person wanted brown paper he must be wanting to tie up parcels; which was the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to do; indeed, it is a thing which I have found to be beyond my mental capacity. Hence she dwelt very much on the varying qualities of toughness and endurance in the material. I explained to her that I only wanted to draw pictures on it, and that I did not want them to endure in the least; and that from my point of view, therefore, it was a question, not of tough consistency, but of responsive surface, a thing comparatively irrelevant in a parcel. When she understood that I wanted to draw she offered to overwhelm me with note-paper, apparently supposing that I did my notes and correspondence on old brown paper wrappers from motives of economy.|$|E
