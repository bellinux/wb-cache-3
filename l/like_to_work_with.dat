25|$|The {{idea of a}} {{planetary}} collision was inspired by websites with theories about such events. Von Trier decided from the outset {{that it would be}} clear from the beginning that the world would actually end in the film, so audiences would not be distracted by the suspense of not knowing.

Cruz wrote that she would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> von Trier, and spoke enthusiastically about the play The Maids by Jean Genet. As von Trier subsequently tried to write a role for the actress, the two maids from the play evolved into the sisters Justine and Claire in Melancholia. Much of the personality of the character Justine was based on von Trier himself. The name was inspired by the 1791 novel Justine by Marquis de Sade.|$|E
