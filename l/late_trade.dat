25|$|Injuries {{quickly became}} a challenge, as the team lost more players to {{injuries}} in their first preseason game than they did during the entire 22-game (preseason through playoffs) 1979 season. The secondary, particularly the safety position, was hit especially hard. Mark Cotney was lost for {{the season with a}} knee injury, Curtis Jordan suffered a broken collarbone, and Cedric Brown missed some time with a bruised shoulder. Cotney was expected to have lost his starting role to Colzie, but was valued as a backup. Jordan was lost to the team when, upon being activated from injured reserve later in the season, he was claimed off of procedural waivers by the Washington Redskins. An injury to Dave Reavis during the same game required arthroscopic surgery that left him sidelined into the regular season, and left the team with only two offensive tackles. As the team had opened training camp with a small roster, McKay had to trade draft picks to the Philadelphia Eagles and Los Angeles Rams to augment the roster with safeties Zac Henderson and Jeff Delaney, and tackle Rick Dozier. Ray Snell was also sidelined, for the second consecutive year, with severe headaches which were attributed to high blood pressure. Rick Berns, the 1979 third-round draft pick who was a capable runner but ineffective as a blocker and passer and who {{had never been able to}} recover from McKay's , was released late in camp. An unexpected shakeup of the receiving corps took place when ex-Steeler Theo Bell and ex-49er James Owens, both among the NFL's leading returners, were brought in with an eye toward improving the special teams. This resulted in the displacement of former FSU star Mike Shumann and original Buccaneer Isaac Hagins, who were promptly released with the hope that they would still have time to catch on with another team. Owens, an Olympic sprinter, came to the team in a <b>late</b> <b>trade,</b> as did Dallas Cowboys starting cornerback Aaron Mitchell, a tough tackler brought in to fill Cotney's role in run support. Adjustments were made to the team's defensive philosophy, with the secondary moving to a more aggressive style of play intended to cut down on opponents' success in the short passing game. The secondary also benefited from an improved pass rush, with Hugh Green's presence preventing blockers from concentrating their efforts on Lee Roy Selmon. James Wilder emerged as a reliable receiver, leading the team in catches during the preseason. McKay reported being happy with the team's preseason performance, saying that they were playing with the intensity and enthusiasm that had been missing the previous year.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper uses daily fund {{flow data}} {{to examine the}} extent of <b>late</b> <b>trading</b> in the U. S. mutual fund industry. Trading {{decisions}} that are {{required by law to}} have been made before 4 PM Eastern Time are correlated with market movements from 4 to 9 PM that evening. The cross-sectional variation in this correlation is consistent with <b>late</b> <b>trading</b> being its primary cause and inconsistent with alternative explanations. For example, apparent <b>late</b> <b>trading</b> ceases in September 2003 after the announcement of the investigation into mutual fund trading practices, it is three times greater in fund families that have been cited by regulators for allowing <b>late</b> <b>trading,</b> and it is greater in funds and asset classes that are also receiving heavy stale price arbitrage flows. In my sample, which includes 75 percent of non-specialized equity mutual funds and 48 percent of assets, <b>late</b> <b>trading</b> led to average annual shareholder dilution from 1998 to 2003 of 3. 8 and 0. 9 basis points in international and U. S. equity funds, respectively. If these dilution rates prevailed industry wide, they would imply shareholder losses of about $ 400 million per year. Furthermore, there is statistically significant evidence of <b>late</b> <b>trading</b> in the funds of 39 of 66 fund families...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses daily fund {{flow data}} {{to examine the}} extent of <b>late</b> <b>trading</b> in the mutual fund industry. Using data from a 10 - 15 percent {{subsample}} of the industry, I find annual long-term shareholder losses due to <b>late</b> <b>trading</b> of about 5 basis points in international equity funds and 0. 6 basis points in domestic equity funds in 2001, and similar dilution rates in a separate dataset for February to July 2003. If these dilution rates prevail industry-wide, it would imply shareholder losses of about $ 400 million per year. Although shareholder losses due to <b>late</b> <b>trading</b> are smaller than those due to market timing, international fund inflows are almost as sensitive to 4 PM to 7 PM market movements {{as they are to}} pre- 4 PM movements, suggesting that the practice is almost as widespread as the timing of international funds. Furthermore, there is statistically significant evidence of <b>late</b> <b>trading</b> in the international funds of 15 out of 50 fund families in the sample. ...|$|R

In a subsequent episode, [...] "Eli's Coming", Dan learns Bobbi is not wrong, but her appearance was different at the time, and Dan knew her as [...] "Roberta".|$|E
50|$|Although Houk did {{his part}} {{to assist the}} Yankees' surge by making a <b>late</b> <b>trade</b> with the Cleveland Indians early in September for Pedro Ramos, {{bringing}} some badly needed help to the bullpen, {{he and the other}} front-office executives did not share the players' newfound respect for Berra. The Harmonica Incident had dominated the sports pages just as news of the team's proposed sale to CBS had broken, a sale which was both controversial in and of itself, as not only was it the first time a major corporation had taken a majority stake in a Major League Baseball team, but there were also issues with the potential conflict of interest with a television network having a vote on the sport's lucrative television contract. White Sox owner Arthur Allyn, Jr. had voted against the deal because he said he had been given only three hours {{in the middle of the}} night to consider it before voting; while his vote (along with that of the Kansas City A's Charlie Finley, who had a longtime grudge against the Yankees) was not enough to stop the deal, the negative publicity convinced the league to hold another vote later in the month, with the result remaining the same.|$|E

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulators have recently identified two significant types of trading abuses [...] market timing and late trading [...] in the mutual fund industry. The more widespread abuse was market timing, which involved situations where investment advisers (firms that may manage mutual funds) entered into undisclosed arrangements with favored customers who were permitted to trade frequently in contravention of stated trading limits. These arrangements harmed long-term mutual fund shareholders by increasing transaction costs and lowering fund returns. Late trading, a significant but less widespread abuse, occurs when investors place trades after the mutual fund has calculated the price of its shares, usually at the 4 : 00 p. m. Eastern Time close of financial markets, but receive that day's fund share price. Investors who <b>late</b> <b>trade</b> {{have an opportunity to}} profit, which is not available to other investors.
