He was privately educated at Prestfelde Public School, London Road. On his 14th birthday his father treated him to a five-shilling, 15-minute flight with Sir Alan Cobham's Air Circus. Unlike most teenagers, Lock was unimpressed by flying and had soon <b>lost</b> <b>interest.</b> At 16 he left school and joined his father's business.|$|E

5|$|Iles {{remained}} as superintendent until 1957, and {{proved to be}} a good publicist for the zoo, taking part in radio and television programmes such as Children's Hour. A new attraction was introduced in 1963, a Chimps' Tea Party, which proved to be very popular. The zoo's last superintendent, Peter Grayson, took over in 1971, but by then the owners of Belle Vue had <b>lost</b> <b>interest</b> in the zoo, and closure seemed imminent.|$|E
5|$|In an interview, Auerbach {{confessed that}} he <b>lost</b> <b>interest</b> in big-time {{managing}} in the early 1990s, preferring {{to stay in the}} background and concentrating on his pastimes, racquetball and his beloved cigar-smoking. He would, however, stay on with the Celtics as president until 1997, as vice chairman until 2001, and then became president again, a position he held until his death, although in his final years, he was weakened by heart problems and often used a wheelchair.|$|E
5|$|Primarily {{created to}} block further {{communist}} gains in Southeast Asia, SEATO {{is generally considered}} a failure because internal conflict and dispute hindered general use of the SEATO military; however, SEATO-funded cultural and educational programs left long-standing effects in Southeast Asia.

5|$|Since 1923, Macaulay had run a cricket outfitters in Leeds and Wakefield {{with his}} Yorkshire team-mate Herbert Sutcliffe, {{borrowing}} £250 {{from his mother}} to help establish the business. During the winter of 1924–25, the shop became a limited company and Macaulay one of its directors. According to Sutcliffe's biographer Alan Hill, Macaulay quickly <b>lost</b> <b>interest,</b> and the partnership was dissolved a year later, but Sutcliffe made the lone venture a success. Macaulay received £900 from the outfitters upon his resignation.|$|E
5|$|When {{it came to}} {{building}} up a new newspaper, Kringen had a certain personal drive, as he ran for parliament in 1909. When he lost the election, he also <b>lost</b> <b>interest</b> to a certain degree. He resigned in 1912 and Ole Holmen, {{a member of the}} Vang municipal council, took over as chief editor. However, he ran afoul of other people involved with the newspaper and was fired in 1913.|$|E
5|$|A serialised {{novelisation}} of Quatermass II, {{written by}} Kneale, {{ran in the}} Daily Express newspaper in the UK from 5 December to 20 December 1955, although Kneale was forced to draw the storyline to a premature conclusion as the paper <b>lost</b> <b>interest</b> in the project. The television scripts were released by Penguin Books in 1960, with a selection of stills from the production also included. The book was re-released in 1979, with a new introduction by Kneale, {{to coincide with the}} transmission of the Thames Television serial.|$|E

5|$|Alright, Still is {{the debut}} studio album by English singer and {{songwriter}} Lily Allen, released on 13 July 2006 by Regal Recordings. After being rejected by several labels, Allen signed to London Records, who eventually <b>lost</b> <b>interest</b> in Allen, leading her to meet production duo Future Cut and sign to Regal Recordings. Recording for the album began in 2004 with sessions between Allen and Future Cut, and Allen's work garnered publicity on the Internet as she posted demos to her Myspace account {{before they were}} officially released. Allen later travelled to the United States to work with Greg Kurstin and Mark Ronson, to complete the final half of the album in 2006.|$|E
5|$|By September 1963, Waters and Mason had <b>lost</b> <b>interest</b> {{in their}} studies and moved into the lower flat of Stanhope Gardens, owned by Mike Leonard, a {{part-time}} tutor at the Regent Street Polytechnic. Waters, Mason and Wright first played music together in late 1963, in a band formed by vocalist Keith Noble and bassist Clive Metcalfe. They usually called themselves Sigma6, but also used the name the Meggadeaths. Waters played rhythm guitar and Mason played drums, Wright played on any keyboard he could arrange to use, and Noble's sister Sheilagh provided an occasional vocal accompaniment. In the early years the band performed during private functions and rehearsed in a tearoom {{in the basement of}} Regent Street Polytechnic.|$|E
5|$|By early 1952, Robey was {{becoming}} noticeably frail, and he <b>lost</b> <b>interest</b> {{in many of}} his sporting pastimes. Instead, he stayed at home and drew comic sketches featuring the Prime Minister of Mirth. In May he filmed The Pickwick Papers, in which he {{played the role of}} old Tony Weller, a part which he had initially turned down on health grounds. The following year, and in aid of the games fund, he starred as Clown in a short pantomime at the Olympic Variety Show at the Victoria Palace Theatre. Organisers asked for him to appear in the Prime Minister of Mirth costume instead of the usual clown garb, a request the comedian was happy to fulfil.|$|E

5|$|Election Special was {{released}} by Perro Verde Records and Nonesuch Records on August 16, 2012, one week before the 2012 Republican National Convention. It received generally positive reviews from critics, who complimented its topical protest songs and Cooder's musicianship. The album peaked at number 164 on the Billboard 200 chart in the US, but charted significantly higher in other countries. Cooder did not tour in promotion of the album, citing a <b>lost</b> <b>interest</b> in both playing large concert venues and the commercial aspect of releasing records.|$|E
5|$|From 1898, the {{newspapers}} that had encouraged so many {{to travel to}} the Klondike <b>lost</b> <b>interest</b> in it. In the summer of 1899, gold was discovered around Nome in west Alaska, and many prospectors left the Klondike for the new goldfields, marking the end of the rush. The boom towns declined and the population of Dawson City fell. Gold mining activity lasted until 1903 when production peaked after heavier equipment was brought in. Since then the Klondike has been mined on and off, and today the legacy draws tourists to the region and contributes to its prosperity.|$|E

5|$|Hanson {{eventually}} dropped out, {{but with}} the financial success of My Best Friend's Wedding (1997), P. J. Hogan entered discussions with Warner Bros. to direct in January 1998. Mike Myers signed on to replace Sean Penn, who vacated the lead role. However, negotiations with Hogan fell through; Sam Mendes, David Fincher and Darren Aronofsky all became interested in taking over the director's position. Fincher and Myers were ing production for Confessions in April 2000 but Fincher dropped out and, by that October, Brian De Palma was attached to direct with Renaissance Pictures co-financing. Later that month, Warner Bros. put the project in turnaround, and Myers <b>lost</b> <b>interest.</b> Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, and Edward Norton had also been attached to the film in the early development stages.|$|E
5|$|In 1880 Sienkiewicz wrote a {{historical}} novella, Niewola tatarska (Tartar Captivity). In late 1881 he became editor-in-chief {{of a new}} Warsaw newspaper, Słowo (The Word). This substantially improved his finances. The year 1882 saw him heavily engaged in {{the running of the}} newspaper, in which he published a number of columns and short stories. Soon, however, he <b>lost</b> <b>interest</b> in the journalistic aspect and decided to focus more on his literary work. He paid less and less attention to his post of editor-in-chief, resigning it in 1887 but remaining editor of the paper's literary section until 1892.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, {{after making}} 24 {{memorial}} tablets for the project, William De Morgan abandoned the ceramics business {{to become a}} novelist, and the only ceramics firm able to manufacture appropriate further tiles was Royal Doulton. Dissatisfied with Royal Doulton's designs, and preoccupied with {{the management of the}} Watts Gallery and Watts Mortuary Chapel in Compton, Surrey, Mary Watts <b>lost</b> <b>interest</b> in the project. Work to complete it was sporadic and ceased altogether in 1931 with only 53 of the planned 120 tiles in place. In 2009, the Diocese of London consented to further additions to the memorial, and the first new tablet in 78 years was added.|$|E
