5000|$|Toyota Progrès (pronounced [...] "Prog-Ray") is a Toyota <b>midsize</b> <b>luxury</b> <b>sedan</b> {{which was}} sold in Japan from May 1998 to June 2007, {{replacing}} the Toyota Corona EXiV. The engine which the Toyota Progrès used is an inline 6-cylinder of 2.5L or 3.0L with VVT-I. Since April 2001 Toyota put in Progres direct injection (D4) engines 1JZ-FSE (2.5L) and 2JZ-FSE (3.0L). It was exclusive to Toyota Japan dealerships Toyopet Store, while its twin the Brevis was exclusive to Toyota Store locations, and shared a marketing approach used on the Toyota Vista Store alternative, called the Toyota Verossa. The width and engine displacement exceed Japanese Government regulations concerning exterior dimensions and engine displacement, and therefore it classified in the larger [...] "passenger car" [...] tax bracket. Two engine sizes were offered to allow Japanese buyers which annual road tax {{they were willing to}} pay; the larger engine did offer higher levels of standard equipment and luxury features.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{on the design of}} a {{parameter}} space based robust PID steering controller. This controller is used for automated steering in automated path following of a <b>midsized</b> <b>sedan.</b> Linear and nonlinear models of this <b>midsized</b> <b>sedan</b> are presented in the paper. Experimental results are used to validate the longitudinal and lateral dynamic models of this vehicle. This paper is on automated steering control and concentrates on the lateral direction of motion. The linear model is used to design a PID steering controller in parameter space that satisfies D-stability. The PID steering controller that is designed is used in a simulation study to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

50|$|The {{release of}} the AMG Hammer sedan in 1986, based on the W124 E-Class, took AMG's {{performance}} modifications for a fast <b>midsized</b> <b>sedan</b> to a new level. AMG made the world's fastest passenger sedan at the time, nicknamed the Hammer, by squeezing Mercedes 5.6-litre V8 tuned by AMG to 360 hp into a <b>midsized</b> <b>sedan.</b> It was very aggressive for the era, with 32-valve cylinder heads and twin camshafts, and said to be faster than the Lamborghini Countach from 60 to 120 mph. Later models were even more powerful and introduced the 17-inch AMG Aero 1 Hammer wheels. 1986 was also the year Mercedes introduced the 560 M117 engine. This provided yet another opportunity for customers to order the largest AMG displacement available at the time, the 6L 100 mm bore SOHC or DOHC engines available for both the W126 coupe and sedans.|$|R
50|$|In {{the family}} <b>midsize</b> <b>sedan</b> {{category}} in North America, the 2008 Nissan Altima {{has been described}} as the sportiest in its classification, compared to the Honda Accord or Toyota Camry.

50|$|Known as the New <b>Midsize</b> <b>Sedan</b> (NMS) {{before its}} {{unveiling}} in January 2011, this unique larger model {{designed specifically for}} the North American market replaces the B6 Passat sedan and wagon for the 2012 model year in Canada, the United States and Mexico. It is also sold in China alongside the Passat Lingyu and Magotan. North American and South Korean models will be built at its Chattanooga Assembly Plant, while Chinese market versions are built by Shanghai-VW in 2011.|$|R
50|$|Production {{started on}} March 3, 1924, as an {{alternative}} production site for the Model T to the River Rouge Plant. It switched to Model A production in 1928, and built M8 Greyhound and M20 Armored Utility Car armored cars during World War II. It {{was the site of}} pickup truck production for 40 years before that operation stopped in 1964. In 1985, it was selected as the site of production for the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable <b>midsize</b> <b>sedans.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Tempra's engine {{range was}} {{similar to that of the}} Tipo. Initially 1.4- and 1.6-litre models had {{carburettor}} engines. Both of these models were discontinued in 1992, due to the new European emission standards, and thus all models from 1992 on had catalytic converters and electronic injection. Transmission was a standard five speed manual, but for the first time a <b>midsize</b> <b>sedan</b> was offered as with a continuously variable transmission which was previously available on the Fiat Uno, Panda, Ritmo and Tipo.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Principal {{component}} analysis (PCA) {{is applied to}} characterize the underlying structures of the acceleration gain surface (AGS) of 15 <b>midsize</b> <b>sedans</b> and to link them with customer preference. The AGS can be characterized by two principal components (PCs), the first PC representing the overall slope of AGS and the second PC representing the linearity of AGS. Findings indicate that customer preference {{is associated with the}} AGS linearity. PCA thus proves itself a valuable method for translating the voice of the customer as well as for setting effective and efficient vehicle acceleration gain targets...|$|R
50|$|The first-generation EcoSport was {{designed}} by the Ford-US Truck Vehicle Center (program code BV226) and {{was based on the}} Cologne-built European Fiesta and Ford Fusion (not {{to be confused with the}} North American Fusion <b>midsize</b> <b>sedan).</b> Because of this, the project used the Ford B3 platform.The EcoSport became one of Ford's best-seller models in Brazil (consistently appearing on the 20 best-selling vehicles), Argentina, Venezuela, and Mexico. Its main competitors were the Fiat Palio Weekend Adventure and Volkswagen CrossFox. The EcoSport sold well and in 2011 sales reached 700,000.|$|R
50|$|The 2012 Volkswagen Passat (formerly {{known as}} the Volkswagen New <b>Midsize</b> <b>Sedan,</b> or NMS while under development) is a mid-sized sedan which replaces the previous-generation Passat B6 in the North American market. The model is also shipped {{overseas}} to South Korea.The Passat NMS was officially announced in January 2011 at the Detroit Auto Show. Built at the Volkswagen Chattanooga Assembly Plant, the new Passat allows building and shipping costs to be reduced significantly over its predecessor making it more competitive to offerings from competitors at the $20K mark.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{important}} to note, as with the NHTSA's frontal impact test, vehicles across different weight categories may not be directly compared. This is because the heavier vehicle is generally considered to have an advantage if it encounters a lighter vehicle or {{is involved in a}} single-vehicle crash. The IIHS demonstrated this by crashing three <b>midsize</b> <b>sedans</b> with three smaller [...] "Good" [...] rated minicars. All three minicars were rated [...] "Poor" [...] in these special offset head-on car-to-car tests, while the midsize cars rated [...] "Good" [...] or [...] "Acceptable".|$|R
5000|$|With {{the revised}} version, Volkswagen {{promotes}} the CC as having [...] "sports car" [...] dynamics, but road tests indicate that [...] "calling the CC a sport sedan is completely misleading." [...] Compared to other <b>midsize</b> <b>sedans</b> in the marketplace, the 2013 Volkswagen CC was evaluated by Edmunds as [...] "attractive and higher-quality alternative ... though its smallish backseat and trunk may be deal-breakers ... and the sport-tuned suspension {{is on the}} firm side." [...] Automotive journalists describe the CC sedan's ride as [...] "nearly sports car firm, with every bump and undulation sent directly to your backside." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, {{sales of the}} Taurus {{declined}} as it lost market share to Japanese <b>midsize</b> <b>sedans</b> and as Ford shifted resources towards developing SUVs. It was discontinued in 2006, with production initially ending on October 27, 2006, and 2007 being the last model year. Ford had decided to replace the Taurus with the fullsize Five Hundred and <b>midsize</b> Fusion <b>sedans,</b> as well as replacing the Taurus wagon with the Freestyle crossover SUV. However, Ford revived the Taurus name during the 2007 Chicago Auto Show {{a few months later}} by renaming two new models that had been intended to be updated versions of the Five Hundred and the Freestyle, the [...] "2008 Taurus" [...] and [...] "2008 Taurus X", respectively. A new model of fullsize Taurus was then released for the 2010 model year, and the 2013 mid-generational refresh (minor model update) was unveiled at the New York Auto Show with minor exterior changes and interior technology options.|$|R
50|$|The Honda Accord was {{the first}} vehicle from a foreign brand that became the top selling car in the United States in 1989. From then on, Japanese {{manufacturers}} designed their <b>midsize</b> <b>sedans</b> to primarily appeal to the lucrative family sedan sector in the United States, with their sales in Japan and other markets an afterthought. Toyota launched the first Camry that exceeded Japanese width restrictions in 1991, a successful attempt that saw them surpass the Accord and Ford Taurus for best-selling passenger car in the United States, and Honda launched a bespoke Accord for the North American market in 1997 that was not sold in Japan or Europe.|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{the larger}} {{size of the}} Altima {{compared}} to the previous model, the new Altima weighs about 120 pounds less. The Altima {{continues to be the}} lightest <b>midsize</b> <b>sedan</b> in its class; this is mostly due to its efficient use of high strength steel and aluminum in areas such as the trunk, hood, and roof. The front end shares the same new corporate grille as the 2012 Versa with more angular headlights than the Versa's rounded ones. It draws many styling influences from [...] "coke bottle styling", an appearance that was popular during the 1960s and 1970s, a return to an appearance Nissan used during that time.|$|R
50|$|The 1977 {{model year}} marked the {{beginning}} of a downsizing of all vehicles, so that cars such as the AMC Concord and the Ford Fairmont that replaced the compacts were re-classified as mid-size, while cars inheriting the size of the Ford Pinto and Chevrolet Vega (such as the Ford Escort and Chevrolet Cavalier) became classified as compact cars. And even after the reclassification vehicles like the Ford Fairmont were far larger than international <b>midsize</b> <b>sedans</b> and rather on par with large cars such as the Ford Granada (Europe). It would not be until the 1980s that American cars were being downsized to truly international dimensions.|$|R
5000|$|For the 1997 model year, Honda {{released}} the [...] "Special Edition" [...] {{version of the}} Accord (not {{to be confused with}} the SE). It was offered in three colors: Heather Mist Metallic, San Marino Red and Dark Currant Pearl. The Special Edition received a factory installed security system with keyless entry, single-disc CD player, body colored side molding, distinctive alloy wheels and a sunroof. It was offered in an automatic transmission only and was fitted with the same engine as the LX. Acclaimed for its handling, the 1996 Accord has been known as one of the best handling Japanese <b>midsized</b> <b>sedans</b> of all time, posting impressive lateral g figures of up to [...]89 g's.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to TMMK, Toyota added Camry production at Subaru of Indiana Automotive, Inc. in 2007 {{to keep up}} with demand for the new Camry and increase production capacity of the Camry Hybrid prior to the decline in the automotive industry in the U.S. On 13 November 2013, Toyota announced it will end the contract with Subaru of Indiana Automotive in 2016. [...] SIA's Camry production was reabsorbed by TMMK, largely because of declines in <b>midsize</b> <b>sedan</b> sales, meaning that all Camry models sold in the US continue to be American-made cars as they have since the 2012 model year. Prior to the 2012 model year, a small amount of Camry models sold in the US were imported from Toyota's Tsutsumi plant in Japan.|$|R

50|$|Hyundai {{has created}} {{vehicles}} {{that run on}} biofuels such as ethanol. The vehicle uses E85, which is 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline. They have also come out with hybrid electric vehicles such as the recent Hyundai Sonata. This is a <b>midsize</b> <b>sedan</b> hybrid which uses primarily a gasoline engine, but also has a lithium-ion polymer battery. This battery is 30 percent lighter than its competitors. Hyundai has also tested Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles such as the Hyundai Tucson. Hyundai partnered with ChevronTexaco Corporation in design and production of the fuel cells for Hyundai. In 2008 Hyundai introduced the i-Blue concept car which was a purely Fuel Cell vehicle.
