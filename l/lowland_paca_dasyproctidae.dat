40|$|During 2009 – 2012, {{wild animals}} were sampled in two areas within the Amazon biome of Brazil, {{in the states}} of Mato Grosso and Pará. Animal tissues and blood were molecularly tested for the {{presence}} of Piroplasmida (genera Babesia, Theileria, Cytauxzoon) or Hepatozoon DNA. Overall, 181 wild animals comprising 36 different species (2 reptiles, 5 birds, and 29 mammals) were sampled. The following Piroplasmida agents were detected: Cytauxzoon felis in one ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), Theileria cervi in two red brocket deer (Mazama americana), Theileria spp. in three nine-banded-armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus), one agouti (Dasyprocta sp.), and four <b>lowland</b> <b>pacas</b> (Cuniculus paca), Babesia spp. in one common opossum (Didelphis marsupialis) and one white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari). The following Hepatozoon agents were detected: Hepatozoon sp. (possibly Hepatozoon caimani) in three spectacled caimans (Caiman crocodilus), Hepatozoon felis in an ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), and Hepatozoon spp. in one scorpion mud turtle (Kinosternon scorpioides) and one <b>lowland</b> <b>paca</b> (Cuniculus paca). Phylogenetic analyses inferred by the 18 S rRNA gene partial sequences supported these results, highlighting at least five novel Piroplasmida agents, and two novel Hepatozoon agents. This study screened the presence of tick-borne protozoa in a number of wildlife species from the Amazon for the first time. Our results indicate that a variety of genetically distinct Piroplasmida and Hepatozoon organisms circulate under natural conditions in the Amazonian wildlife...|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the large}} mammals of the {{ecoregion}} still survive, despite the human pressure, although some are reduced to small populations.Surviving mammals probably include mantled howler (Alouatta palliata), white-fronted capuchin (Cebus albifrons), jaguar (Panthera onca), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), margay (Leopardus wiedii), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), red brocket (Mazama americana), <b>lowland</b> <b>paca</b> (Cuniculus paca) and Central American agouti (Dasyprocta punctata).Endangered reptiles include green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) and hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata).|$|R

50|$|The {{park was}} {{originally}} covered in mixed montane rainforest, {{but due to}} human exploitation little of the original coverage remains.It is presently {{in the process of}} regeneration.There are fragments of the original Araucaria Forest, which contain species such as Brazilian walnut (Ocotea porosa), Paraná pine (Araucaria angustifolia), yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis), cedar (Cedrela fissilis) and Brazilian oak (Roupala brasiliensis).Fauna include crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous), brocket deer (Mazama species), Brazilian squirrel (Sciurus aestuans), azure jay (Cyanocorax caeruleus), jacu (Penelope species) and endangered species such as <b>lowland</b> <b>paca</b> (Cuniculus paca) and oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus).|$|R
50|$|There is much {{confusion}} in the nomenclature of this and related species; see agouti. In particular, the popular term agouti or common agouti normally refers to species of the distinct Dasyprocta genus (such as the Central American agouti, Dasyprocta punctata). Sometimes the word agouti is also used for a polyphyletic grouping uniting the families Cuniculidae and Dasyproctidae, which, besides the pacas and common agoutis, includes also the acouchis (Myoprocta). Cuniculus is the appropriate genus name instead of Agouti based on a 1998 ruling of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature as the <b>Lowland</b> <b>Paca's</b> genus.|$|R
50|$|The {{town has}} several cooperatives of local {{residents}} operating tourism related businesses. One is Escudo Jaguar, which provides boat trips to Yaxchilan and more extensive tours to ruins farther away. There are some small simple hotels {{as well as}} camping areas. Nueva Alianza has cheaper and more rustic lodging along with small boats to Yaxchilan. It is operated by the Sociedad Cooperativa de Bienes y Servicios Nueva Alianza, which is a Ch’ol organization. The cooperative has wildlife, a nursery for crocodiles, <b>lowland</b> <b>pacas</b> and deer. There are other smaller cooperatives just along the docks with also provide boating services.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lowland</b> <b>paca</b> has coarse fur without underfur, {{dark brown}} to black {{on the upper}} body and white or {{yellowish}} on the underbelly. It usually has three to five rows of white spots along its sides, against a dark grey background. It has thick strong legs, with four digits in the forefeet and five in the hind feet (the first and fifth are reduced); the nails function as hooves. The tail is short and hairless. The zygomatic arch is expanded laterally and dorsally and {{is used as a}} resonating chamber - a unique feature among mammals.|$|R
50|$|As at {{the other}} sites on the Altiplano Cundiboyacense, {{the main part of}} the diet of the people was formed by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Other mammals {{included}} little red brocket (Mazama rufina), guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), crab-eating fox (Dusicyon thous), spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus), ocelot (Felis pardalis), puma (Felis concolor), <b>lowland</b> <b>paca</b> (Agouti paca), Agouti taczamawskii, Dasyprocta, ring-tailed coati (Nasua nasua), western mountain coati (Nasuella olivacea), common opossum (Didelphis marsupialis) and collared anteater (Tamandua tetradactyla). Reptiles consisted of the turtle Kinosternon postinginale and remains of caimans, indicating hunting in terrains much farther to the west; the Magdalena River.|$|R
50|$|The lagoon {{has many}} caxeta trees, a light wood {{used to make}} wooden shoes, pencils, wooden spoons and craft items.The lagoon has {{abundant}} fish, and is the largest breeding place for marine life in Guaratuba Bay.It forms an environment like the Pantanal, where birds and small animals forage.It {{is said to be}} the area with greatest biodiversity on the coast of Paraná.Capybaras may be seen in the lagoon.Other animals are broad-snouted caiman, <b>lowland</b> <b>paca</b> and common agouti, as well as birds such as herons, ducks and neotropic cormorants.The wattled jacana is a common bird in the ponds and swamps of Brazil.The marsh antwren is rare and considered endangered, a small creeping species identified only recently.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lowland</b> <b>paca</b> (Cuniculus paca), {{also known}} as the spotted paca, is a large rodent found in {{tropical}} and sub-tropical America, from East-Central Mexico to Northern Argentina.

It is {{also known as}} the gibnut in Belize, where it is prized as a game animal, labba in Guyana, lapa in Venezuela, and lappe on the island of Trinidad.|$|R
50|$|The Colombian fino Hound is {{a hunting}} dog {{developed}} in Colombia from pack hounds {{along with some}} pointing dogs imported from Continental Europe, Great Britain and North America in Colonial days. Due to their ability as hunters, they became popular with all the social classes from Presidents of the Republic and the upper class because of their interest in hunting and sporting events, to the farmers and humble classes as {{they were used to}} hunt in order to find food.Due to geographic isolation suffered by the country over its history, it has been led to a great diversity of hounds still preserved and used for hunting of <b>Lowland</b> <b>paca</b> and others rodents. For over 200 years these hunting dogs have been used in Colombia to find their prey and they are equally adapted to the diverse geographical areas and climates of the country.|$|R
50|$|Many of the {{products}} here are from Europe, Asia {{and the rest of}} the Americas. Of particular note is the wide variety of meat products found. Fresh meat from many different animals, both from Mexico and abroad can be found. These meats include those from iguanas, skunks, deer, rabbit, suckling pigs, goat, wild boar and <b>lowland</b> <b>paca.</b> One very unusual specialty is lion meat, from animals raised for those purpose in Zumpango and sells for about 850 pesos per kilo. Fresh meats are from both Mexican and international sources, primarily Central America and the United States, with the most popular being rabbit, venison, wild boar and crocodile. Poultry includes Cornish hens, duck, pigeon, goose, turkey, doves as well as the eggs from various types of birds. The market also has some of the finest seafood selections in the city, both Mexican and imported, including caviar that sells for more than 6,000 pesos a kilo.|$|R
