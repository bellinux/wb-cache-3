25|$|On {{the other}} hand, though it's fetishistic and personal, I {{like to think}} that my fetishes aren't that obscure. Who doesn't want to see girls running down the {{trenches}} of World War One wreaking havoc? I'd always had an interest in those worlds comic books, fantasy art, animated films. I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>this,</b> that's how I approach everything, and then keep pushing it from there.|$|E
500|$|The BBC Foreign Affairs Editor John Simpson {{encountered}} similar difficulties on {{the issue}} of censorship while reporting from Iraq during the Gulf War in 1990–91. [...] "When I worked in Baghdad, officials there always used to mention our Sinn Féin ban if you criticised their censorship. I don't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> country appearing {{on the same side of}} the dividing line as Saddam Hussein on anything at all." [...] At a conference on the reporting of Northern Ireland-related issues at the University of London in November 1993, chaired by the Irish journalist Mary Holland, several participants claimed it was undermining the practice of investigative reporting.|$|E
2500|$|United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon [...] said [...] "Denying {{historical}} facts, {{especially on}} such an important subject as the Holocaust, is just not acceptable. Nor is it acceptable to call {{for the elimination of}} any State or people. I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> fundamental principle respected both in rhetoric and in practice by {{all the members of the}} international community. [...] United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan himself visited Iran and had a series of dialogues with the Iranian leadership and other senior-level people. Wherever and when, and if the situation requires me to do, I am also prepared to engage in dialogue with the Iranian leadership." ...|$|E

60|$|After this speach, the old genlmn sunk {{down on the}} sofa, {{and puffed}} as much smoke {{out of his mouth}} as if he'd been the chimley of a steam-injian. I was pleased, I confess, with the sean, and <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> venrabble and virtuous old man a-nocking his son about the hed; just as Deuceace had done with Mr. Richard Blewitt, as I've before shown. Master's face was, fust, red-hot; next, chawk-white: and then sky-blew. He looked, for all the world, like Mr. Tippy Cooke in the tragady of Frankinstang. At last, he mannidged to speek.|$|R

6000|$|... "Those are {{certainly}} clouds, not smoke," [...] said Whopper. [...] "Oh, I {{hope it does}} rain and puts out the fire. I shouldn't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> fine forest destroyed." ...|$|E

6000|$|It was Mrs. Clavering who {{suggested}} to Mr. Saul {{that perhaps he}} would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Fanny. <b>This</b> she did when her story had been told, and he was preparing to leave her. [...] "Certainly, if she will come to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, not I, but I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> whither <b>this</b> branch trends, {{and what}} it is like; besides, the {{divergence}} will not cost us much time, as we can cross at any point we have a mind to, and come at the main river again through the woods." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Be serious, now. I want {{it settled}} before Easter. I must {{go down to}} my lord then, and even before; and I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> settled before we separate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{friends would}} <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> trap," [...] said the hermit, who, of course, acted {{the part of}} {{interpreter}} wherever they went, being well acquainted {{with most of the}} languages and dialects of the archipelago.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{something}} more in it than that," [...] said the other, positively. [...] "I don't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> love-your-enemy business with you, Jem; it ain't natural to you. Has your health been all right while I've been away?" ...|$|E

5000|$|When, at 80 {{years of}} age, Cagney was asked which {{of his films}} [...] - [...] outside of Yankee Doodle Dandy [...] - [...] that he'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> again, <b>this</b> was the film he chose.

6000|$|He protested, [...] "I don't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you do <b>this.</b> Don't {{give up your}} plans. I'll hitch up and we'll {{start out}} and keep going till we find you a school." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Bring {{him to me}} when he comes, Baron. I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> young fire eater, who thrust {{himself so}} boldly into a matter {{in which he had}} no concern, solely because he heard a woman's voice calling for help.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to help them get the bucket out of the captain's well," [...] he continued. [...] "As it is so very deep I may be useful. And I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> Miss Vye--not so much for her good looks as for another reason." ...|$|E

O how I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you <b>this</b> very day.|$|R
50|$|The European Union (EU) only {{allows the}} use of source {{separated}} urine in conventional farming within the EU, but not yet in organic farming. This is a situation that many agricultural experts, especially in Sweden, would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> changed. <b>This</b> ban may also reduce the options to use urine as a fertilizer in other countries {{if they wish to}} export their products to the EU.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's too {{bad that}} you don't {{get some kind of}} message." [...] Plum lowered his voice. [...] "I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you alone <b>this</b> noon or to-night. I--er--want to talk {{something}} over with you," [...] he whispered.|$|R
6000|$|... "Feudalism," [...] said Job. [...] "I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> estate managed on {{the same}} {{principles}} as they do their great establishments {{in the north of}} England. Instead of feudalism, I would substitute the commercial principle. I would have long leases without covenants; no useless timber, and no game." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "An' he may {{send the}} barons naked home {{as he did}} the King's soldiers," [...] laughed Bertrade de Montfort.

We determined that it {{should not be allowed to}} fall into ruins. There are already too many ruins in Ireland." [...] He also bought the land in front of the castle from the trustees [...] "in order that it should never be built on and the castle would be seen in all its dignity and splendour". The handover ceremony also marked the foundation of The Butler Society , a still thriving organisation that connects, preserves and unites a family once dominant in the British Isles. Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull turned up at the castle hand over party, with Jagger telling the newspapers [...] "We just came to loon about." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> countryman of yours, Andrew and to {{hear his}} news from himself directly.

6000|$|... "Why, look here, Bromfield!" [...] said Bellingham for {{the second}} time. [...] "Why don't you let me manage this affair for you?

6000|$|... "The man {{mentioned}} bernicle and I'd {{expect to}} find them on the outer end of the flat, because it's soft ground and bernicle get their food in the mud. Besides, I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how <b>this</b> channel runs as the sands dry; there's more water than I thought. Suppose we leave the punt and walk down the edge?

"We would <b>like</b> much <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> {{wonderful}} Kablunet," [...] remarked the jovial big hunter Simek, with a bland {{look at the}} company, [...] "but Ujarak knows best.

6000|$|She was comfortably crying now, the {{defensive}} altogether abandoned. [...] "It's love, Daddy.... Oh! love!.... He's going tomorrow." [...] For {{a minute or}} so neither spoke. Scrope's mind was entirely made up in the matter. He approved altogether of his daughter. But the traditions of parentage, his habit of restrained decision, made him act a judicial part. [...] "I'd <b>like</b> just <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> boy," [...] he said, and added: [...] "If it isn't rather interfering...." ...|$|R
