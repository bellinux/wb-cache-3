50|$|It is {{understood}} that rearrangement occurs between specific {{sites on the}} DNA called recombination signal sequences (RSSs). The signal sequences are composed of a conserved palindromic heptamer and a conserved AT- rich nonamer. These signal sequences are separated by non-conserved spacers of 12 or 23 base pairs called one-turn and two-turn respectively. They are within the <b>lambda</b> <b>chain,</b> k-chain and The processes of rearrangement in these regions are catalyzed by two recombination-activating genes: RAG-1 and RAG-2 and other enzymes and proteins. The segments joined due to signals generated RSSs that flank each V, D, and J segments. Only genes flank by 12 -bp that join to the genes flank by 23-bp spacer during the rearrangements and combinations to maintain VL-JL and VH-DH-JH joining.|$|E
50|$|Raji {{cell line}} is the first {{continuous}} human cell line from hematopoietic origin. The cell lines produce an unusual strain of Epstein-Barr virus which will both transform cord blood lymphocytes and induce early antigens in Raji cells. Translocations between chromosomes 8 and 22 have occurred in all three lines, but the cells synthesize immunoglobulin M with light chains of the kappa type, {{in contrast to the}} usual concordance between a translocation involving chromosome 22 and <b>lambda</b> <b>chain</b> synthesis. Both kappa genes and one lambda gene are rearranged. These findings indicate either that translocation may occur as a separate event from immunoglobulin gene rearrangement or that the proposed hierarchical sequence of immunoglobulin gene rearrangements is not always adhered to. The data also imply that in cells containing a translocation between the long arm of chromosome 8 and a chromosome bearing an immunoglobulin gene, alteration of cellular myc expression may occur regardless of the immunoglobulin gene that is expressed. Raji cell is widely used as a transfection host and also to understand the hematopoietic and other cell malignancies. It also used for detection of immune complex because it possesses and expresses several receptors for certain complement components, as well as Fc receptors for immunoglobulin G.|$|E

40|$|A {{patient with}} {{multiple}} myeloma (MM), who initially {{presented with a}} predominant IgG lambda and a minor IgD lambda paraprotein pattern, is described. After chemotherapy, levels of the IgD lambda protein increased and the IgG lambda levels decreased. The following results were obtained when serum IgD was predominant. In the bone marrow, there were three plasma cell populations: a major one containing only delta chains, a minor one containing only gamma chains, and another minor one containing both delta and gamma chains. All these plasma cell populations contained <b>lambda</b> <b>chains.</b> Stimulation of circulating mononuclear cells with pokeweed mitogen (PWM) achieved differentiation of circulating B lymphocytes into plasma cells: 30 % with only cytoplasmic delta <b>lambda</b> <b>chains</b> and 10 % with only cytoplasmic gamma <b>lambda</b> <b>chains.</b> These IgG-containing plasma cells showed cytoplasmic reactivity with rabbit antiserum raised against monoclonal IgD which was shown to contain specificities recognizing both delta chains and idiotypic determinants present in both serum IgD lambda and IgG lambda. Circulating B lymphocytes were 'monoclonal': almost all expressed surface delta <b>lambda</b> <b>chains,</b> and {{a small proportion of}} them expressed both delta gamma and <b>lambda</b> <b>chains.</b> High levels of IgD were detected in the supernatants of all cultures, but high concentrations of IgG were only detected in those from PWM-stimulated cultures with very low levels of IgM and IgA. These findings suggest that plasma cells producing either IgD or IgG were derived from a common B-cell clone.

40|$|Detection {{of total}} free light chains (FLC) of {{immunoglobulins}} and their ratio (kappa/lambda quotient) {{are used in}} diagnostics and monitoring of multiple myeloma and other gammapathies, primary amyloidosis and multiple sclerosis. Previously described immunoassays with monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) against cryptic and constantly exposed epitopes of FLC failed to recognize rare variants of lambda Bence-Jones proteins and {{a significant proportion of}} <b>lambda</b> <b>chains</b> excreted with urine. Aiming to improve this approach, a novel murine Mab (IgG 2 b coded as 1 C 8) was employed, which specifically binds free <b>lambda</b> <b>chains</b> but doesn’t interact with native IgA, IgG, and IgM. The novel Mab recognized an epitope exposed at free <b>lambda</b> <b>chains</b> in peripheral blood of healthy donors and patients with multiple myeloma. It is not destroyed or masked upon renal filtration. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine basic features of improved assay system, and to estimate its potential in diagnostics of monoclonal gammapathies. The mixtures of three Bence-Jones proteins of either kappa- or lambda- types purified from the urine of multiple myeloma patients were used as calibrator samples. Improved immunometric assay is able to detect free kappa and <b>lambda</b> <b>chains</b> in serum and urine at a scale of 1 to 100 ng/ml, thus being three orders more sensitive than, e. g., detection levels of Freelite method based on polyclonal antibodies. A novel assay allows to detect free kappa and <b>lambda</b> <b>chains</b> at comparable levels in serum or urine, and to deduce kappa/lambda ratio. The proposed assay is able to detect FLC in 10, 000 -fold excess of whole IgG molecules. The calibrating plots for both antigens are linear on log-log scales, with very similar slopes. Detection thresholds for kappa or <b>lambda</b> <b>chains</b> proved to be 5 and 3 ng/ml, respectively. Mean concentrations of free kappa chains in sera of healthy donors were 6. 7 ± 2. 1, in urine, 4. 2 ± 3. 8 mcg/ml. Mean concentrations of free <b>lambda</b> <b>chains</b> were 4. 7 ± 1. 96, and 1. 6 ± 1. 0 mcg/ml, respectively. This method, if applied to serum and urine samples from multiple myeloma patients, revealed free light chains were similar to the paraproteins detected by means of electrophoresis/immunofixation.

5000|$|Dry eye is {{the most}} common eye disease, {{affecting}} 5 - 6% of the population. Prevalence rises to 6 - 9.8% in postmenopausal women, and as high as 34% in the elderly. [...] Tears lubricate the lid and are important for the refraction of light. Tears also promote epithelial health. Only {{a small fraction of the}} estimated 1543 proteins in tears are differentially deficient or upregulated in dry eye. Analysis of lacritin requires 1D or 2D SDS PAGE to differentiate monomer from tissue transglutaminase inactivated polymer. Accordingly, lacritin monomer was reported to be differentially downregulated in mild to severe aqueous deficient dry eye, and in contact lens-related dry eye. In a larger trial, 95% of tears from patients with aqueous deficient dry eye were lacritin monomer deficient. In Sjogren's syndrome dry eye, lacritin monomer deficiency appears to be linked with corneal staining and nerve pathology. Two studies that did not differentiate monomer from multimer did note any change of lacritin in dry eye. Topical treatment of eyes of dry eye mice (Aire knockout mouse model of dry eye) restored tearing, and suppressed both corneal staining and the size of inflammatory foci in lacrimal glands. Lacritin monomer deficiency in tears of patients with blepharitis was also reported. [...] Blepharitis is an inflammation of the eyelid often associated with dry eye. In climatic droplet keratopathy, N119 appears to be un-glycosylated. Also a normal breast cancer localization reported by some has not been replicated in Unigene (the 'mammary gland' hit is for breast cancer) and gene array studies, but some breast cancers appear to display elevated expression or LACRT gene amplification. iTRAQ analysis of tears from diabetics at different stages of disease detected relatively more lacritin, lysozyme, lipophilin A, lipocalin 1, immunoglobulin <b>lambda</b> <b>chain</b> and lactotransferrin in tears of patients with diabetic retinopathy. The analysis did not distinguish lacritin monomer from polymer, and proposed the application of all as biomarkers. Tear lacritin monomer is barely detectable in the initial stage of infection by Fusarium solani in fungal keratitis. [...] Also down regulated are tear lipocalin-1 and cystatin S. [...] Fungal keratitis accounts for half of all corneal ulcers in Africa and India - the primary source of blindness in these countries.A double-masked, randomized, multicenter phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of 'LacripepTM' in dry eye subjects with Sjogren's syndrome is currently underway at 27 US sites.

Yet, some free Ig <b>lambda</b> light <b>chains</b> are secreted {{despite the presence}} of an unpaired cysteine (Cys 214). This is due largely to the presence of a flanking acidic residue: substitution of Asp 213 for Gly or Lys increases pre-Golgi retention and degradation of free lambda.

In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), <b>lambda</b> <b>chains</b> form covalent complexes with many proteins through Cys 214. These complexes are absent from the Golgi.

To investigate the molecular mechanism for isotypic kappa-lambda exclusion, {{in particular the}} role of the Ig kappa intron enhancer, we replaced this enhancer by a neomycin resistance (neoR) gene in embryonic stem (ES) cells.
