40|$|Abstract For the {{protection}} of <b>commercial</b> <b>interests,</b> licensing bodies such as the EMA and health technology assessment institutions such as NICE restrict full access to unpublished evidence. Their respective policies on data transparency, however, lack a systematic account of (1) what kinds of <b>commercial</b> <b>interests</b> remain relevant after market approval has been granted, (2) what the specific types of public interest are that may override these <b>commercial</b> <b>interests</b> post approval, and, most importantly, (3) what criteria guide the trade-off between public interest and legitimate measures for {{the protection}} of <b>commercial</b> <b>interest.</b> Comparing potential <b>commercial</b> <b>interests</b> with seven specifications of relevant public interest reveals the lack of proportionality inherent in the current practices of EMA and NICE. </p...|$|R
40|$|Preventing money {{laundering}} {{is a major}} international problem. Several attempts, from the national to the international level, {{have been made to}} address and prevent {{money laundering}}. These are often frustrated by the dynamic nature of the crime itself. However, regardless of its reach and dynamism in illegal or legal transactions, which are often intertwined, individual nations need {{to address the issue of}} money laundering to signify to an international audience and <b>legitimate</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>interests</b> their intent to tackle money laundering and thus illustrate that public and private state run organisations in the financial and law enforcement sectors are honest and professional, and that their country is a ‘place to do business’. This thesis, therefore, presents an evaluation of the strategies and future directions of money laundering in Dubai, as it is a ‘new’, dynamic place in which to conduct business and the financial centre of the Middle East. It examines the various ways in which legislation and law enforcement in Dubai are struggling with and tackling the issues and problems of money laundering in the face of organised crime and terrorism. In this thesis, the concepts of money laundering and financial crimes in Dubai, with a special focus on strategies as well as future direction of control, are explored in some depth. This work has established that Dubai has a substantial anti-money laundering framework; however, it suffers from some weaknesses. These weaknesses are caused by the poor relationship between anti-money laundering units, the Anti-Organised Crime Department of the Dubai police, the financial sector and the Central Bank of Dubai. This situation is particularly evident when it comes to sharing information on those suspected of money laundering in Dubai. The ‘lack of a relationship’ is illustrated by primary research, as is the fact that other nations have (i. e. the UK) developed a more intelligence-led approach and partnerships in their quest to prevent money laundering where possible in their jurisdiction. This thesis highlights the progress that is needed in Dubai and the UAE to prevent money laundering, and as such is an original contribution to knowledge in an under-researched field in the Middle East...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The European Union is the world’s biggest trader and player, {{accounting}} for 20 % of global imports and exports, and promotes trade benefits for all. EU has open trade {{among its members}} and has brought growing prosperity to all its member states, agreeing that trade can boost the economic growth and productive capacities of all nations, including the poor ones. 1. The European Union as a world trade player. European Union has now a population of 450 million – more than the United States and Russia combined. It is the world’s biggest trader and generates one quarter of global wealth. Its currency, the euro, comes {{second only to the}} US dollar in international financial markets. The EU did not set out to become a world power. Born in the aftermath of World War II, its first concern was bringing together the nations and peoples of Europe. But as the Union expanded and took on more responsibilities, it had to define its relationships {{with the rest of the}} world. Just as it has worked to remove trade barriers, develop poorer regions and promote peaceful cooperation within its frontiers, so the Union works with other countries and international organisations to bring everyone the benefits of open markets, economic growth and stability in an increasingly interdependent world. At the same time, the EU defends its <b>legitimate</b> economic and <b>commercial</b> <b>interests</b> in the international arena. The European Union shows, besides playing a world’s peacemaker role, how countries can successfully pool economic and political resources in the common interest. It serves as a model for integration between countries in other regions of the world. Since its birth in the 1950 s, the European Union has been developing relations with the rest of the world through a common policy on trade, development assistance and formal trade and cooperation agreements with individual countries or regional groups. The EU’s common trade policy operates at two levels. Firstly, within the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the European Union is actively involved in setting the rules for th...|$|R
