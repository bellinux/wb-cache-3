2500|$|Bighorn ewes have {{a six-month}} gestation. In {{temperate}} climates, {{the peak of}} the rut occurs in November with one, or rarely two, lambs being born in May. Most births occur in {{the first two weeks of}} the <b>lambing</b> <b>period.</b> Pregnant ewes of the Rocky Mountains migrate to alpine areas in spring, presumably to give birth in areas safer from predation, but are away from areas with good quality forage. Lambs born earlier in the season are more likely to survive than lambs born later. Lambs born late may not have access to sufficient milk, as their mothers are lactating at a time when food quality is lower. Newborn lambs weigh from [...] and can walk within hours. The lambs are then weaned when they reach four to six months old. The lifespan of rams is typically 9–12 years, and 10–14 years for ewes.|$|E
40|$|Domestic sheep {{ranching}} is {{an important}} agricultural industry in the United States and coyote (Canis latrans) depredation on lambs and ewes continues to challenge ranchers and agencies responsible for protecting sheep. Lethal methods used in controlling coyote depredation include aerial gunning, toxicants, trapping, and calling and shooting. Nonlethal methods include frightening devices, fences, livestock protection animals, and stringent husbandry practices. Ranchers and agencies responsible for controlling coyote depredation need frightening devices that are more effective than those currently available. We describe a field evaluation of 2 animal-activated frightening devices: an acoustic device and an acoustic device with a pop-up scarecrow and strobe light. We conducted the evaluation on open range in western Wyoming during the <b>lambing</b> <b>period.</b> No coyote kills were reported during 6, 087 sheepnights at 3 sites protected by the acoustic devices or during 6, 598 sheepnights at 3 sites protected by the acoustic scarecrow devices.

40|$|In many species, females show reduced {{expression}} of a trait that is under sexual selection in males, and this expression {{is thought to be}} maintained through genetic associations with the male phenotype. However, there is also the potential for the female trait to convey an advantage in intrasexual conflicts over resources. We tested this hypothesis in a feral population of Soay sheep, in which males and females have a polymorphism for horn development, producing either full (normal horned), reduced (scurred) or no (polled, females only) horns. During the <b>lambing</b> <b>period,</b> females who possessed horns were more likely to initiate and win aggressive interactions, independent of age, weight and birthing status. The occurrence of aggression was also context dependent, decreasing over the <b>lambing</b> <b>period</b> and associated with local density.

Lambs were fed concentrate (180 g/kg CP, 18. 7 MJ of GE/kg DM) and barley straw ad libitum until the slaughter weight (25 SEM = 1. 4 kg BW). Lambs were distributed in 9 pens per period in groups of 4 or 5 <b>lambs</b> (<b>Period</b> 1) and 7 <b>lambs</b> (<b>Period</b> 2) according to their weaning BW and age, and BW and concentrate and straw intakes as well as water consumption were measured weekly. Blood samples to determine glucose and insulin concentrations were obtained at 2 and 4 wk of the study, and carcass weight was recorded at the slaughterhouse. At slaughterhouse a sample of rumen mucosa of the caudal sac of the ventral zone was obtained {{to determine the number}} of rumen papillae, and a sample of the Longissimus dorsi from ten female lambs per treatment was obtained to analyse fatty acid profile of the meat. None of the parameters measured in lambs were affected by the glycerine content of concentrates. The only differences observed were in meat fatty acid composition. The C 12 (P= 0. 08) and C 17 (P= 0. 06) tended to be greater in lambs fed concentrates with glycerine than without glycerine. In contrast, total amount of C 18 : 1 cis in muscle tended (P= 0. 10) to be greater in lambs consuming a concentrate without glycerine than in lambs receiving concentrates with glycerine.

Pregnant twin bearing ewes and non-pregnant ewes were then allocated to four periods of treatment, infection timed {{relative to the}} post-parturient changes in host susceptibility to nematode infection. These commenced either 4 weeks prior to <b>lambing</b> (<b>period</b> 1), at <b>lambing</b> (<b>period</b> 2), 6 weeks after <b>lambing</b> (<b>period</b> 3) or 12 weeks after <b>lambing</b> (<b>period</b> 4). Within each period of infection, pregnant ewes were further allocated to four groups (n= 6) viz initial slaughter (group A); the remaining animals were treated with anthelmintic and given either a single infection with 20, 000 larvae of Ostertagia circumcincta (group B) followed by slaughter after 21 days, 4000 /larvae per day for 50 days (group C) or no infection (group D). Groups C and D were again dosed with anthelmintic and give a single infection with 20, 000 larvae on day 57 and slaughtered 21 days later. Non-breeding ewes (group BA -n= 6) were challenged on day one of each period with 20, 000 larvae and slaughtered 21 days later. All ewes were housed indoors and offered a pelleted diet. Faecal egg counts were determined weekly, and ewe liveweight, food intake, milk production and serum pepsinogen measured weekly. Total Worm counts and numbers of eggs in utero were determined from samples obtained at slaughter. A relaxation in the immune response to infection was apparent during late pregnancy (period 1) and early lactation (period 2) as judged by faecal egg counts, but appeared to be greatest around parturition when maximum worm burdens occurred (period 2). Significantly higher worm burdens were found in response to challenge in breeding ewes compared to non-breeding ewes at all times, except period 4. By 12 weeks after lambing worm burdens in breeding ewes {{were similar to those}} found in non-breeding ewes throughout the experiment. From mid-lactation (periods 2. 3), increasing signs of host resistance to infection were evident Host suppression of faecal egg output was seen during periods 2 and 3, with egg output being reduced by 50 % and 95 % respectively, compared to that seen during period 1. Numbers of eggs in utero per adult worm were 25, 45 and 37 eggs/worm in period 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Faecal egg counts (period 1) and worn burdens (period 1 and 2) of previously infected ewes were lower than their initially non-exposed counterparts. Indicating that the effect of larval stimulus during late pregnancy and lactation (periods 1 & 2), evoked a substantial immune response in lactating ewes after rechallenge at day 57. Parasitism reduced milk production by 10 - 59 % and wool staple strength by 44 - 29 %.

40|$|Labour {{influences}} the liveability of organic sheep farms and {{the sustainability of}} this activity on rural areas. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse work flexibility of organic suckler sheep farms using the criterion 'room for manoeuvre in time'. A survey about work organisation was conducted on 14 organic sheep farms in the central region of France to quantify work durations and tasks carried out by different categories of workers in order to calculate the room for manoeuvre in time. Statistical analysis was performed to analyse variability in room for manoeuvre. A cluster analysis conducted on four variables describing room for manoeuvre in time over the year classified the farms into three groups. The results show that the room for manoeuvre in time per person displayed a broad variability according to the farms (396 to 1, 199 h per year). The amount of routine work per person of the basic group was one factor explaining the differences. Results show different ways to obtain room for manoeuvre in time and its temporal distribution over the year, among organic suckler sheep farms. Three repartitions were identified. Group 1 was characterised by a low room for manoeuvre in winter, corresponding to the <b>period</b> of <b>lambing</b> in the sheep barn. The high routine workload was carried out self-sufficiently by the basic group. Group 2 had a high room for manoeuvre over the year. The farmers delegated a part of the routine work during holidays.

Statistical analysis revealed a significantly lower risk of goats housed indoors all year-round to be infected by SBV than for goats kept outside day and night. The low intra-herd seroprevalence demonstrates that German goat flocks are still at risk of SBV infection.

In addition, potentially harmful drug residues in food-animal products and antimicrobial resistance in bacteria may be associated with extra-label drug use (ELDU). No data had been documented on drug use, specifically antimicrobial use (AMU), in Ontario sheep, although it was thought that much use was extra-label. This study investigated AMU and ELDU on 49 lamb-producing Ontario sheep farms. Data were prospectively collected over 12 months from the participating farms, and farm-level practices were ascertained with a questionnaire. Treatment-level and farm-level variables were investigated for associations with rates of AMU by means of Poisson rate regression models fit with a generalized estimating equation to control for clustering at the farm level. Antimicrobials with high mean exposure rates included chlortetracycline (in feed), penicillins, and oxytetracycline. The exposure rate in lambs was significantly lower (P < 0. 01) with antimicrobial treatment of systemic signs, respiratory disease, or wound or injury than with treatment of other reported diseases or conditions; it was also significantly lower with 3 or more <b>lambing</b> <b>periods</b> per year (α = 0. 05). The exposure rate in adult sheep was significantly lower with treatment of 5 of the 6 most prevalent diseases or conditions (α = 0. 05) and significantly higher with producer decision to treat and producer experience of 20 y or greater. Rates of using antimicrobials not licensed for use in sheep were high, as was extra-label use of licensed antimicrobials.

The model maximises the number of ewes to clooked after over the <b>lambing</b> <b>period,</b> when constrained by labour availability for various key tasks and by a pre-determined level of sheep welfare. The results show a trade-off between welfare level and labour input per sheep. Dropping tasks with less significant welfare and productivity consequences is an effective way of increasing carrying capacity (from 977 ewes/shepherd to 1428), as is working longer hours (1174 ewes/shepherd) or only doing the legal minimum of welfare checking (labour reduced from 0. 68 min/ewe to 0. 44 min/ewe).

Environmental Protection Agency under {{authority}} of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, as amended, granted the California Department of Food and Agriculture an experimental permit to obtain data to support registration of sodium cyanide as a predacide. The program was implemented by the Tehama County Department of Agriculture. The experimental permit provided for use of not more than 300 sodium cyanide spring-loaded ejector mechanisms (SCSLEM) and 1, 800 sodium cyanide capsules. The permit was issued April 1, 1974 and expired June 1, 1975. The program objectives were to: (l) measure {{the usefulness of the}} SCSLEM as a method of reducing domestic livestock losses due to predation by coyotes; (2) measure the effectiveness and economics of reducing livestock losses from coyotes only during the principal <b>lambing</b> <b>period</b> from September through May; (3) determine the cost of controlling coyotes with SCSLEM 2 ̆ 7 s as compared to trapping, shooting, and denning; (4) evaluate the effect of SCSLEM 2 ̆ 7 s on non-target species; (5) evaluate the selectivity of SCSLEM 2 ̆ 7 s when used to control coyotes; (6) measure the amount of coyote control that can be achieved through the use of SCSLEM 2 ̆ 7 s without causing unreasonable adverse effects on the environment; and (7) evaluate the use of SCSLEM 2 ̆ 7 s with regards to human safety...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate ewe and lamb performance in an accelerated lamb production system, and to compare the performance and lamb output between a conventional and an accelerated lamb production system. In the “Conventional” system, ewes were bred in March to lamb in August. The “Accelerated” system was based on the “STAR” system (Lewis et al., 1996), in which there were five breeding periods within each year. In the current experiment these were 14 th January, 28 th March, 9 th June, 21 st August and 2 nd November. Progesterone was used to synchronise the breeding periods and during the non-breeding season, eCG was used to induce reproductive activity. Lambing began on each of these dates and weaning was 73 days later, coinciding with the next breeding period. The experiment ran over a three-year period beginning with breeding in March 2003 and was complete with the weaning of lambs from the January 2006 -bred ewes. This resulted in 15 <b>lambing</b> and breeding <b>periods</b> over the three years in the Accelerated system and three <b>lambing</b> and breeding <b>periods</b> in the Conventional system. Average pregnancy rates were lower in the Accelerated system than in the Conventional system. Lamb growth rates were similar between the two systems, although lamb live weights at weaning were lower in the Accelerated system due to the age of the lambs at weaning (average = 69 vs 96 days). More lambs were born and weaned, resulting in more kilograms of lamb weaned in the Accelerated system relative to the Conventional system over the experimental period (26, 200 vs 24, 300 kg). Labour input was 35 % higher in the Accelerated system, or 13 % higher per lamb weaned. Average annual ewe energy requirements were 6 % higher in the Accelerated system. Ewe energy requirements per kilogram of lamb weaned was lower (6 %) in the Accelerated system due to more breeding and <b>lambing</b> <b>periods</b> per ewe per year. Laparoscopic observation of ewes’ ovaries at each breeding period revealed that most ewes had active ovaries and were therefore capable of successfully producing a viable foetus. In a subsequent experiment, blood samples were collected for analysis of progesterone concentrations from ewes bred during the spring and autumn breeding periods. Observations of data indicated that a small number of ewes conceived and lost their conceptus, or had abnormal corpora lutea. Results suggested that pregnancies were failing due to a lack of an appropriate signal from the embryo to the dam/uterus. Exposing Romney ewes to an artificial lighting regimen was unsuccessful for inducing reproductive activity during spring. In another experiment, melatonin implants administered to Romney ewes in spring and used in conjunction with eCG and progesterone, resulted in 61 % more lambs born per ewe treated, compared to eCG and progesterone alone. This result indicated that melatonin implants, used with eCG and progesterone may be a suitable method for improving reproductive performance in sheep bred out of season in New Zealand. Delaying weaning of lambs and breeding lactating ewes can be used to obtain heavier lamb weaning weights in the Accelerated system. Spring-bred ewes had lambs weaned at either 69 days post partum or 90 days post partum. Reproductive performance was similar between the two groups of ewes, and lamb live weights in the later weaned group were heavier when lambs were 90 and 120 days of age. This research has shown that accelerated or out-of-season lamb production is an option for some New Zealand sheep farmers. However, the mechanisms associated with reproductive seasonality and methods of successfully circumventing this seasonality require further attention in order to achieve optimum reproductive performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{control of}} Q fever, a {{zoonotic}} disease {{caused by the}} Coxiella burnetii bacterium, remains a scientific challenge. Domestic ruminants are considered the main reservoir, shedding C. burnetii essentially through parturition products during abortion or birth. Sheep are particularly frequently associated with human outbreaks, but there are insufficient field data to fully understand disease dynamics and instigate efficient control measures. A longitudinal follow-up study of a naturally infected sheep flock was performed in order to: (a) investigate relationships between seropositivity and bacterial shedding in the vaginal mucus, (b) describe the kinetics of antibodies, including responses to vaccination, (c) monitor maternal antibodies in ewe lambs, and (d) compare serological results in milk and serum samples. For eight months, we collected blood samples every three weeks from 11 aborting and 26 non-aborting dairy ewes, 20 non-aborting suckler ewes and nine ewe lambs. Individual milk samples were also obtained from lactating females. All serum and milk samples were tested by ELISA whereas vaginal swabs were tested by quantitative PCR. We found that some dairy females did not seroconvert although they shed C. burnetii in their vaginal mucus or despite vaccination. Overall, antibody levels in adult females were found to remain stable over time, with exceptions during the mating and <b>lambing</b> <b>periods.</b> Maternal antibodies decreased during the first month after birth. Interestingly, antibody levels in milk were correlated with those in serum. This study provides valuable field data that will help improve Q fever surveillance and within-flock management measures. Importance Field data are necessary to improve the surveillance, diagnosis and sanitary management of Q fever in livestock. Here, we provide extensive serological data obtained from serum and milk samples of infected and vaccinated ewes belonging to a naturally infected flock of sheep. We show that antibody levels are stable over time and that seropositivity and vaginal shedding are not clearly correlated, whereas antibody levels in milk are strongly correlated with those in serum. Accordingly, we find that antibody levels in bulk tank milk {{are consistent with the}} variations observed in the serum of dairy females over time. For the first time, we report the existence of maternal antibody transmission to ewe lambs and we show that the presence of maternal antibodies at birth does not impact the serological response to vaccination at the age of 4 months. Finally, we report that adult ewes generally seroconvert after vaccination, including during pregnancy...|$|R
40|$|Two {{trials were}} {{conducted}} {{to evaluate the use}} of dried poultry waste as a source of degradable intake protein in growing and finishing ruminant diets. Trial 1 utilized eight-eight crossbred lambs (62 lb) in a 60 -day growing period and subsequent 60 -day growing period and subsequent 60 -day finishing period. In the growing <b>period,</b> <b>lambs</b> were fed seven levels of degradable intake protein, 5. 6 to 7. 7 % of diet DM (7. 6 to 9. 7 % CP) from either urea or dried poultry waste. In the finishing <b>period,</b> <b>lambs</b> (71 lb) were fed a control diet containing no added N, 4. 1 % degradable intake protein (9. 6 % CP) or six levels of degradable intake protein, 4. 7 to 8. 5 % (10. 1 to 12. 6 % CP) from either urea or dried poultry waste. In the growing phase, no response to level of degradable intake protein was observed. Feed efficiencies for urea and dried poultry waste were equal. In the finishing phase, dried poultry waste was equal to urea as a source of degradable intake protein. In Trial 2, four ruminally-fistulated crossbred yearling steers (642 lb) were used to evaluate rumen ammonia concentration from feeding dried poultry waste or urea. Steers were ruminally dosed with. 08 lb of nitrogen from either urea or dried poultry waste. Steers dosed with urea had greater ammonia concentration at two and four hours compared to those dosed with dried poultry waste. Dried poultry waste was utilized a effectively as urea in growing and finishing lamb trials and concentration of ammonia in the rumen was less for dried poultry waste...|$|R
40|$|While {{seasonality}} {{has often}} been investigated with respect to reproduction, seasonality of mortality has received less attention. We investigated whether a seasonal signal of mortality exists in wild ruminants kept in zoos, using data from 60, 591 individuals of 88 species. We quantified the mortality in the 3 consecutive months with the highest above-baseline mortality (3 MM). 3 MM {{was not related to}} relative life expectancy of species, indicating that seasonal mortality does not necessarily impact husbandry success. Although 3 MM was mainly observed in autumn/winter months, there was no evidence for an expected negative relationship with the latitude of the species’ natural habitat and no positive relationship between 3 MM and the mean temperature in that habitat, indicating no evidence for species from lower latitudes/warmer climates being more susceptible to seasonal mortality under zoo conditions. 3 MM was related to reproductive biology, with seasonally reproducing species also displaying more seasonal mortality. This pattern differed between groups: In cervids, the onset of seasonal mortality appeared linked to the onset of rut in both sexes. This was less evident in bovids, where in a number of species (especially caprids), the onset of female seasonal mortality was linked to the <b>lambing</b> <b>period.</b> While showing that the origin of a species from warmer climate zones does not constrain husbandry success in ruminants in terms of an increased seasonal mortality, the results suggest that husbandry measures aimed at protecting females from rutting males are important, especially in cervids...|$|E
40|$|The aim was {{to study}} the polymorphisms of the {{melatonin}} receptor 1 A gene (MTNR 1 A) and its relationship with seasonal reproduction in the Sarda sheep breed. Four-thousand multiparous ewes reared under natural photoperiod were randomly chosen. Genomic DNA was extracted and subjected to PCR for the amplification of {{the main part of}} exon II of the ovine MTNR 1 A gene (GenBank U 14109). PCR products were subjected to restriction enzymes MnlI and RsaI and placed into +/+, +/- or -/- group for MnlI and C/C, C/T or T/T group for RsaI. Samples were cloned and sequenced. The sequences were aligned with the U 14109 sequence of GenBank. Data were subjected to allelic frequency analysis and to the x 2 test in order to evaluate the link between genotype and reproductive activity. After MnlI digestion, allelic frequency was 0. 78 for allele +and 0. 22 for allele -; genotype frequency of the +/+ homozygote was 68 %, 20. 5 % for +/- and 11. 5 % for -/-. After RsaI, allelic frequency was 0. 66 for allele C and 0. 34 for allele T; genotype frequency of the C/C homozygote was 53. 5 %, 26 % for C/T and 20. 5 % for T/T. The population was in Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium both for the MnlI and RsaI. Lambing frequency of +/+ genotype ewes was higher in the period September-December while for -/- genotype in January-April (P< 0. 01). Lambing of C/C genotype ewes showed a higher frequency in September-December while for T/T genotype in January-April (P< 0. 01). Results confirmed that the polymorphism of the MTNR 1 A locus was also present in the Sarda with a higher incidence of the +/+ and C/C genotypes. The animals that carried one of these two gene isoforms showed a not seasonal reproductive activity with the <b>lambing</b> <b>period</b> in September-December...|$|E
40|$|Much {{research}} has been conducted on the life cycle of T. gondii by means of investigation of experimentally infected animals. However, much less has been achieved in studies of naturally infected populations. In particular, controversy surrounds the relative importance of congenital transmission, which is generally believed to be very low. I report a detailed analysis of T. gondii transmission, with specific reference to congenital transmission, in a naturally infected sheep population. Nucleic acid amplification methods (PCR) were developed for use in the detection of T. gondii from artificially and naturally infected tissue samples. PCR amplification of both the SAG 1 gene and TOX element were optimised to enable definitive detection of T. gondii in tissue samples from a range of animals including experimentally infected mice and naturally infected sheep. A study of the relationship between lamb mortality and T. gondii was carried out at a farm in Worcestershire (Average lamb mortality for Suffolk Cross was 10. 5 %). A single study of a <b>lambing</b> <b>period</b> in spring 1999, using PCR amplification techniques, demonstrated that congenital transmission was occurring in 61 % of lambings (n= 88) (Duncanson et al, 2001). To further confirm these results, a three-year longitudinal study was conducted using a sample of 255 ewe pregnancies. This extended study also revealed high levels of congenital transmission (59 %). Separate studies on two independent flocks (Suffolk Cross and Charollais) showed levels of congenital transmission at 61 % and 53 % respectively. One implication of these high levels of congenital transmission is that a significant number of lambs may be born infected with T. gondii but show no significant detrimental effects to health. Due to the lack of clinical disease demonstrated in live born lambs congenitally infected with T. gondii, these animals enter the food chain for consumption and potential transmission of the parasite to humans.

40|$|The {{influence}} of perennial ryegrass endophyte on sheep reproduction and early lamb growth was studied in a 3 -year grazing experiment at the AgResearch regional station at Gore (46 ” 07 ’S, 168 ” 54 ’E). The trial consisted of 8 paddocks sown in endophyte-infected (+E) or endophyte-free (-E) Grasslands Nui perennial ryegrass, with (+C) or without Grasslands Huia white clover. Endophyteinfected ryegrass delayed the lamb drop and reduced lamb weight gains during the lactation <b>period.</b> <b>Lamb</b> drop was delayed {{by an average}} of 3 - 5 days especially in the presence of clover. This may be due to an extended gestation period or delayed mating.

40|$|Evaluating {{the feeding}} value of wet okara as a protein {{supplement}} for lactating ewes with twin lambs was the objective. A 4  ×  4 Latin square replicated 2 × (4 sheep, 4 treatments, 4 periods per square; 2 squares) {{was conducted to}} examine the influence of concentrate mix (okara or not) and type of forage (silage or hay) on ewe milk composition and growth of their lactating <b>lambs.</b> Treatment <b>periods</b> were 14 days (7 days adaptation and 7 days collection). Ewes (55 to 74. 8  kg BW) were fed 1 of 4 diets: wheat middling and corn concentrate with mixed grass hay (TSH), okara and corn with mixed grass hay (OSH), soybean and wheat middlings with hay crop silage (TSS), and okara and corn with hay crop silage (OSS). Ewes fed hay diets had lower forage dry matter intakes than ewes fed silage. Intake of okara supplement was higher (P <  0. 05) with OSH (3. 64  kg/d) than with OSS (1. 70  kg/d). There {{was no difference in}} supplement intake between TSH and TSS. There were no differences among diets for lamb daily gains or in ewe milk compositions among the diets.

40|$|Growth rate (G), {{body weight}} (W) and metabolizable energy intake (Mei) of 33 {{imported}} Mongolian ram lambs {{were used to}} estimate requirements for maintenance (MEm) and gain during 2 periods each 4 weeks long. The diet contained 2. 7 Mcal ME/kg DM and was individually fed at 24, 30 and 36 g DM/kg W/day. Growth rate means for the low and medium feed levels were slower (P> 0. 05) by 10. 6 and 9. 4 %, respectively in period I than in period II. On the other hand, growth rate means indicated there was a compensatory gain for those lambs on high feed level in period I, but gain was limited in period II. W and G were related (P< 0. 05) to MEi, Mcal/day in period I and II. Multiple regression equation for period I was Mei= 1. 367 + 0. 021 (W, kg) + 4. 105 (G, kg).
