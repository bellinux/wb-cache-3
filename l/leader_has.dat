5|$|A Project Leader {{is elected}} once per {{year by the}} developers.

Delegates make decisions as they think is best, taking into account technical criteria and consensus. By way of a General Resolution, the developers may recall the leader, reverse a decision made by the leader or a delegate, amend foundational documents and make other binding decisions. The voting method is based on the Schulze method (Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping).|$|E

5|$|The story {{takes place}} in the year 2011, where a radical <b>leader</b> <b>has</b> {{executed}} the president of an unnamed country in the Middle East, and an ultranationalist movement ignites a civil war in Russia. The conflicts are seen from the perspectives of a U.S. Force Reconnaissance Marine and a British SAS commando, and are set in various locales, such as the United Kingdom, the Middle East, Azerbaijan, Russia, and Ukraine. The multiplayer portion of the game features various game modes, and contains a leveling system that allows the player to unlock additional weapons, weapon attachments, and camouflage schemes as they advance.|$|E
5|$|In the Jamiltepec {{region of}} Mexico, there exists {{perhaps the most}} {{colorful}} version {{of that kind of}} dance, the Chareos dance. It represents a battle between Moors, led by Pilate, and Christians, led by James, the apostle. Sixteen male dancers take part and the dancer who plays the part of James appears as a horse rider and wears a costume that incorporates a white horse. The dancers wear ostrich feathers on their heads, a peacock feather at the front, white cotton square over their shoulders, velvet trousers decorated with gold brocade over white cotton pants and carry a machete. In addition, the <b>leader</b> <b>has</b> a hat with a small mirror and a white feather headdress. Two men at the front carry two red flags and two white flags, red symbolizing the blood spilt by James' soldiers and white symbolizing the peace that reigned after the Christian victory. The sounds of drums and flutes accompany the dance. These dances that pit Christian against Moor are almost certainly Christianized versions of earlier, pre-Cortez dances that ritualized the battle between the tiger and the eagle.|$|E
5|$|The {{competition}} {{itself is}} composed of two rounds. In round one, all 40 qualified athletes complete a single jump in the aforementioned World Cup order. After points for distance and style are achieved, only the top 30 scorers from the first round proceed to the second, while the rest are eliminated from the event. In round two, the starting order is instead {{based solely on the}} points gained in the first round: the lowest scoring athlete jumps first, while the <b>leader</b> <b>has</b> the very last jump of the competition. The athlete with the most points from both rounds wins that competition. For the second competition, the starting order for round one uses the results from the first competition – no longer based on World Cup ranking – with athletes again jumping in ascending order of points. After the second (and final) round, the athlete with the most points accumulated from both competitions is declared the Ski Flying World Champion.|$|E

Although {{he had only}} one first place vote on the ten ballots, he was ranked ahead of Okafor and Stanley Johnson who {{combined}} for seven first place votes. Alexander and Mudiay were the only players named on 9 of the 10 ballots. The preseason points <b>leader</b> <b>has</b> gone {{on to win the}} award in four of the prior five years. His November 15 verbal commitment announcement was scheduled on the same date as Okafor, Jones and Stanley Johnson. According to ESPN, all four were among the top 10 in the national class (Okafor #1, Alexander #3, Jones #4 and Johnson #9). On the eve of his announcement, Kansas and Illinois were the favorites for his services. He made his verbal commitment on ESPNU to Kansas basketball on November 15. He was flanked by his father (Clifton Terry) and mother (Latillia Alexander). Prior to his senior season, USA Today named him to its 10-man preseason All-USA team along with Stanley Johnson, Jones, Trey Lyles, Emmanuel Mudiay, Malik Newman, Okafor, Oubre, D'Angelo Russell, and Turner.

25|$|However, {{this very}} fact (that the {{follower}} would play non-Stackelberg if the leader were to play Stackelberg) means that this profile {{is not a}} Nash equilibrium of the subgame starting when the <b>leader</b> <b>has</b> already played Stackelberg (a subgame off the equilibrium path). If the <b>leader</b> <b>has</b> already played Stackelberg, the best response of the follower is to play Stackelberg (and therefore {{it is the only}} action that yields a Nash equilibrium in this subgame). Hence the strategy profile - which is Cournot - is not subgame perfect.|$|E

25|$|If, {{after the}} leader had {{selected}} its equilibrium quantity, the follower deviated from the equilibrium and chose some non-optimal quantity {{it would not}} only hurt itself, {{but it could also}} hurt the leader. If the follower chose a much larger quantity than its best response, the market price would lower and the leader's profits would be stung, perhaps below Cournot level profits. In this case, the follower could announce to the leader before the game starts that unless the leader chooses a Cournot equilibrium quantity, the follower will choose a deviant quantity that will hit the leader's profits. After all, the quantity chosen by the leader in equilibrium is only optimal if the follower also plays in equilibrium. The leader is, however, in no danger. Once the <b>leader</b> <b>has</b> chosen its equilibrium quantity, it would be irrational for the follower to deviate because it too would be hurt. Once the <b>leader</b> <b>has</b> chosen, the follower is better off by playing on the equilibrium path. Hence, such a threat by the follower would not be credible.|$|E
25|$|Firms may {{engage in}} Stackelberg {{competition}} {{if one has}} some sort of advantage enabling it to move first. More generally, the leader must have commitment power. Moving observably first is the most obvious means of commitment: once the <b>leader</b> <b>has</b> made its move, it cannot undo it - it is committed to that action. Moving first may be possible if the leader was the incumbent monopoly of the industry and the follower is a new entrant. Holding excess capacity is another means of commitment.|$|E
