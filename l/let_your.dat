5|$|The poet W. H. Auden {{taught for}} {{three years in the}} 1930s at The Downs School, in the Malvern Hills. He wrote many poems there, including: This Lunar Beauty; <b>Let</b> <b>Your</b> Sleeping Head; My Love, Fish in the Unruffled Lakes; and Out on the Lawn I Lie in Bed. He also wrote the long poem about the hills and their views, called simply The Malverns.|$|E
5|$|The {{best thing}} of all is that the Greeks should not {{go to war with}} each other at all, but give the gods hearty thanks if by all {{speaking}} with one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a stream, {{they may be able to}} repel the attacks of barbarians and save themselves and their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the present juncture at least we ought to be unanimous and on our guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against the danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. You will do this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult on the contrary for their good as you would for your own person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your eyes to the west, and <b>let</b> <b>your</b> thoughts dwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of you to postpone your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once you allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon Greece, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or war, and in a word all these games which we are now playing against each other, will be so completely knocked out of the hands of us all, that we shall be praying heaven to grant us only this power of making war or peace with each other at our own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.|$|E

25|$|The Argumenty i Fakty {{articles}} {{prompted a}} response from Pravda observer Viktor Kozhemyaka {{in the form of}} an article titled Fifty years after her death Zoya is tortured and executed again. In the article, Kozhemyaka criticized Sinyavskaya's theory and upheld the official expert conclusion about the identity of the executed partisan. Later the Institute for Criminal Expertise and the Department of Justice of the Russian Federation issued an official conclusion stating that the family photographs of Kosmodemyanskaya belong to the same person as the Pravda photograph of the hanged partisan. The article ended in emotional sentences <b>Let</b> <b>your</b> names be sacred for centuries, Tanya, Zoya, Lila! So many of you gave for us the most precious thing you had; your lives. And we cannot, should not, and indeed have no right to forget or betray you.|$|E

500|$|The last recitative, [...] "" [...] (Lord, <b>let</b> <b>Your</b> {{faithful}} {{love for}} me), is secco, but closes as an arioso {{on the words}} [...] "" [...] (and considers your love constantly).

500|$|The work {{ends with}} a harmonically complex four-part setting of the chorale, [...] "" [...] (Ah, Lord, <b>let</b> <b>Your</b> dear little angel). It is a prayer to be sent an angel to carry the soul in Abraham's Bosom, and a promise to praise God eternally. Bach's setting is {{remarkable}} for its final two bars: the trumpets and timpani create a [...] "magnificent blaze of sound". Bach chose the same stanza of Schalling's chorale to end his St John Passion, in the work's first and last version.|$|E

500|$|The mélodies {{are very}} short; in the piano edition, each takes up two pages, except the first, {{for which the}} {{instrumental}} prélude takes up a full page. [...] The fourth mélodie, [...] "La petite tortue ...", is only seventeen measures long—the number of syllables in a Japanese haiku. [...] Alexis Roland-Manuel remarked on this mélodie: [...] "Do not <b>let</b> <b>your</b> modesty make you forget a certain fable by La Fontaine.

500|$|Harrison's musical biographer, Simon Leng, {{describes}} the lyrics as being among its composer's [...] "most tactile", full of [...] "sexual passion" [...] and [...] "images {{of sight and}} touch".

Leng also notes the [...] "clear climactic overtones" [...] evident in the choruses, where Harrison urges his lover to [...] "Let your hair hang all around me... / <b>Let</b> <b>your</b> love flow and astound me." [...] Musically, the composition features contrasting moods between the ethereal, ballad-like verses and the more strident choruses.|$|E

She took an interest in mitigating the emotional effects of the attacks on children, particularly the disturbing images repeatedly replayed on television. On the one-year anniversary, she encouraged parents to instead read to their children, and perhaps light a candle in memoriam, saying, [...] "Don't <b>let</b> <b>your</b> children see the images, especially on September 11, when you know it'll probably be on television again and again – the plane hitting the building or the buildings falling." ...|$|E

When the band started to write the songs for the album, they joined the character of 'Mr. Lovewell' and the concept of 'loving well', creating the overall message of love that is present in the album.

500|$|Kershaw {{started the}} 2010 season by posting a 3.07 ERA in April, but {{did so by}} walking 22 batters in 29 innings. On May 4, he had his worst start of his career against the Milwaukee Brewers at Dodger Stadium, {{throwing}} just 57 pitches in 1 innings, while retiring only four of the 13 batters he faced—including the pitcher. He was booed loudly upon being pulled from the game. Kershaw said after the game, [...] "I didn't give our team any kind of chance.

500|$|According to this theory—one of many—for {{as long as}} Prospero {{is battling}} with these qualities and lost in books, he is banished from Milan.
