40|$|<b>Light-emitting</b> <b>diode</b> (LED) {{lighting}} {{should be}} considered for lighting efficiency enhancement, however, waste heat from <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diode</b> (LED) lighting increases the internal cooling load during the summer season. In order {{to solve this problem}} we propose a thermal management system for <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diode</b> (LED) lighting with a heat exchanger module integrated with the building’s heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system to move the lighting’s waste heat outdoors. An experiment was carried out to investigate the thermal effects in a test chamber and the heat exchange rate between the heat sink and the duct air. The heat generated by the <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diode</b> (LED) lighting was calculated as 78. 1 % of <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diode</b> (LED) input power and the heat exchange rate of the lighting heat exchange module was estimated to be between 86. 5 % and 98. 1 % according to the <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diode</b> (LED) input power and the flow rate of air passing the heat sink. As a result, the average <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diode</b> (LED) lighting heat contribution rate for internal heat gain was determined as 0. 05; this value was used to calculate the heating and cooling energy demand of the office building through an energy simulation program. In the simulation results, the cooling energy demand was reduced by 19. 2 % compared with the case of conventionally installed <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diode</b> (LED) lighting...|$|R

To make a comparison, a typical commercial chip on board–type <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diode</b> array using a copper-based plate which has the same chip layout and the same power input was also investigated. The surface temperature distribution and total thermal resistance corresponding to these two high-power <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diode</b> modules were measured using a thermal infrared camera and a MicReD T 3 Ster.

The average temperatures of <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diode</b> copper- and vapor chamber–based plates are 100. 5 °C and 41. 5 °C at 100 [*]W power input, respectively. In addition, the maximal temperature difference of the 100 -W <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diode</b> array vapor chamber–based plate is 2. 2 °C far less than 31. 7 °C of copper-based plate.

5|$|ZnO is {{a wide-bandgap}} {{semiconductor}} of the II-VI semiconductor group. The native doping of the semiconductor due to oxygen vacancies or zinc interstitials is n-type. This semiconductor has several favorable properties, including good transparency, high electron mobility, wide bandgap, and strong room-temperature luminescence. Those properties are valuable in emerging applications for: transparent electrodes in liquid crystal displays, energy-saving or heat-protecting windows, and electronics as thin-film transistors and <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diodes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Whereas mechanical, {{electrical}} and electrochemical (supercapacitor) {{properties of the}} carbon nanotubes are well established and have immediate applications, the practical use of optical properties is yet unclear. The aforementioned tunability of properties is potentially useful in optics and photonics. In particular, <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diodes</b> (LEDs) and photo-detectors based on a single nanotube have been produced in the lab. Their unique feature is not the efficiency, which is yet relatively low, but the narrow selectivity in the wavelength of emission and detection of light {{and the possibility of}} its fine tuning through the nanotube structure. In addition, bolometer and optoelectronic memory devices have been realised on ensembles of single-walled carbon nanotubes.|$|E
5|$|Indium {{has many}} semiconductor-related applications. Some indium compounds, such as indium {{antimonide}} and indium phosphide, are semiconductors with useful properties: one precursor is usually trimethylindium (TMI), {{which is also}} used as the semiconductor dopant in II–VI compound semiconductors. InAs and InSb are used for low-temperature transistors and InP for high-temperature transistors. The compound semiconductors InGaN and InGaP are used in <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diodes</b> (LEDs) and laser diodes. Indium is used in photovoltaics as the semiconductor copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), also called CIGS solar cells, a type of second-generation thin-film solar cell. Indium is used in PNP bipolar junction transistors with germanium: when soldered at low temperature, indium does not stress the germanium.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} {{was an attempt to}} {{establish}} a suitable method for the effective diagnosis of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis in Bangladesh. In this regard, detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from 390 different extra-pulmonary specimens was performed by Bright-Field microscopy, <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diode</b> fluorescence microscopy and Lowenstein–Jensen culture methods, followed by an extensive comparison among these methods. M. tuberculosis was detected in 53 cases through the conventional Lowenstein–Jensen culture method; 49 cases were detected under Bright-Field microscope, whereas the <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diode</b> fluorescence microscopy detected 64 cases. Out of 53 culture-positive isolates, 12 were found to be multi-drug resistant. <b>Light-emitting</b> <b>diode</b> fluorescence microscopy was found to be more sensitive and effective than both the Bright-Field microscopy and the Lowenstein–Jensen culture methods.

5|$|Silicon carbide (SiC), {{also known}} as {{carborundum}} , is a semiconductor containing silicon and carbon with chemical formula SiC. It occurs in nature as the extremely rare mineral moissanite. Synthetic silicon carbide powder has been mass-produced since 1893 for use as an abrasive. Grains of silicon carbide can be bonded together by sintering to form very hard ceramics that are widely used in applications requiring high endurance, such as car brakes, car clutches and ceramic plates in bulletproof vests. Electronic applications of silicon carbide such as <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diodes</b> (LEDs) and detectors in early radios were first demonstrated around 1907. SiC is used in semiconductor electronics devices that operate at high temperatures or high voltages, or both. Large single crystals of silicon carbide can be grown by the Lely method; they can be cut into gems known as synthetic moissanite. Silicon carbide with high surface area can be produced from SiO2 contained in plant material.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic diamond has {{potential}} uses as a semiconductor, {{because it can}} be doped with impurities like boron and phosphorus. Since these elements contain one more or one less valence electron than carbon, they turn synthetic diamond into p-type or n-type semiconductor. Making a p–n junction by sequential doping of synthetic diamond with boron and phosphorus produces <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diodes</b> (LEDs) producing UV light of 235nm. Another useful property of synthetic diamond for electronics is high carrier mobility, which reaches 4500cm2/(V·s) for electrons in single-crystal CVD diamond. High mobility is favourable for high-frequency operation and field-effect transistors made from diamond have already demonstrated promising high-frequency performance above 50GHz. The wide band gap of diamond (5.5 eV) gives it excellent dielectric properties. Combined with the high mechanical stability of diamond, those properties are being used in prototype high-power switches for power stations.|$|E
