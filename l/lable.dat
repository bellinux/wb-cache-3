40|$|Bibliography: leaves 194 - 227. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the role of anger on managerial effectiveness. To this end, a sample of male managers in a South African financial organisation completed questionnaires on the experience of anger, the expression of anger, and Type A behaviour. Managerial effectiveness was assessed in terms of the behavioural dimensions of the organisation's assessment centre and performance appraisal, as well as a managerial achievement quotient. A factor analysis computed separately for the 11 assessment centre dimensions and the 11 performance appraisal criteria revealed three orthogonal factors in both analyses. Product moment correlation coefficients were calculated between all the variables, including the new factor scores. The performance appraisal factor <b>labled</b> "Emphasising Quality in Solution and Production" was significantly correlated with trait anger, and the performance appraisal factor <b>labled</b> "Maintaining Supportive Interpersonal Relationships" was significantly correlated with state anger, trait anger, anger expression, and Type A behaviour. The assessment centre factors <b>labled</b> "Making and Communication Decisions" and "Interpersonal Planning" correlated significantly with anger expression and trait anger, respectively. Finally, the managerial achievement quotient correlated positively and significantly with Type A behaviour. The conceptual and methodological issues confronted in the present research may provide new insight for future investigations regarding stress and organisational psychology...|$|R

50|$|Siewert {{has been}} living in Vienna since the age of 10. He studied guitar at the University of Music and Performing Arts Graz. As a guitarist, he started his public {{performances}} in 1995. In his early performances, he played with Herwig Gradischnig, Freier Fall, Franz Hautzinger and his own band Duckbilled Platypus. With this band, he published two albums under the <b>lable</b> Extraplatte. Almost like other musicians in Vienna in that time (Boris Hauf, Dieb13, Hautzinger, Werner Dafeldecker or Hilga Hinteregger), he began to free himself from jazz idiom and developed an abstract sound by guitar. Soon, he became a member of Efzeg (with Burkherd Stangl and Hauf) and Komfort. He invited Dafeldecker, Hinteregger, Wayne Horvitz and Tony Buck to the group Komfort. In the group Trapist, he played with Joe Williamson and Martin Brandlmayr. In My Kingdom for a lullably, he played with Christof Kurzmann, Axel Dörner and with the video artist of Efzeg, Billy Roisz. He also performed as member of guitar quartet SSSD. Other members of SSSD were Taku Sugimoto, Werner Dafeldecker and Burkhard Stangl.

5000|$|Near {{the end of}} 2008, it {{was rumored}} that JoJo had parted ways with Da Family Entertainment and Blackground Records, and had signed a new record {{contract}} with Interscope Records. In early 2009, JoJo denied the rumor, saying {{that she was still}} signed to Blackground Records. Later in June 2009, JoJo confirmed that the album had been fully completed and will begin its promotion as soon as her record label finalized a new distribution deal. JoJo, after having waited almost two years to get her album released, decided to file a lawsuit against her label in August 2009. She was asking to be released from Da Family Records and to receive US$500,000 for her troubles. JoJo won the case, and in October 2009 Blackground Records reached a distribution deal with Interscope Records. When speaking of the <b>lable</b> issues JoJo says [...] It was very frustrating. For a while I felt like, why am I continuing to go into the studio constantly if it's never going to be released? It was a very frustrating, stagnant place. I got discouraged at some points, but I just kept believing in what we kept trying to make happen and what I've been working my whole life towards. I was able to release music less through less nontraditional means, but I {{had to find a way}} to stay creative and express myself in spite of the legalities.|$|E

40|$|Background. Sunscreens usually {{protect the}} skin against {{harmful effects of}} sunlight. These {{products}} contain two effective physical and chemical components, which protects the skin from sunlight. Sun protection factor (S. P. F) is a critical factor indicating the effect of sunscreen against sunlight. &# 13; Methods. To measure S. P. F of sunscreens, various in-vivo and in-vitro methods have been established. In this study, two in-vitro methods were used. In 'Transpore tape' method, sunscreen product was dispersed uniformly on the substrate to obtain a surface coverage of 2 mg/cm 2 of the product. Transmittance measured spectrophotometerically, and then S. P. F was calculated. In the second method (solvent method) different concentrations of test products were prepared in methanol. The sample's transmittance were measured to evaluate S. P. F. &# 13; Results. Results of the first method indicated a good linear relationship between measured S. P. F and the <b>labled</b> S. P.
