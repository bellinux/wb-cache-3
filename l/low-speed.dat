5|$|A {{data packet}} {{consists}} of the PID followed by 0–1,024bytes of data payload (up to 1,024bytes for high-speed devices, up to 64bytes for full-speed devices, and at most eightbytes for <b>low-speed</b> devices), and a 16-bit CRC.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{configuration}} of the Circuit de Monaco, with its low average speed and abundance of <b>low-speed</b> corners, allied to the low-grip nature of the public road surface, the teams all set their cars up to produce the maximum amount of downforce and mechanical grip possible. Benetton modified their car's suspensions to work better on the circuit's <b>low-speed</b> corners. The Minardi cars came equipped with a new titanium cast gearbox and new rear suspensions. McLaren brought an additional spare car to the event, with four in total being shared between Häkkinen and Coulthard.|$|E
5|$|In {{starting}} a motor, a VFD initially applies a low frequency and voltage, thus avoiding high inrush current associated with direct-on-line starting. After {{the start of}} the VFD, the applied frequency and voltage are increased at a controlled rate or ramped up to accelerate the load. This starting method typically allows a motor to develop 150% of its rated torque while the VFD is drawing less than 50% of its rated current from the mains in the <b>low-speed</b> range. A VFD can be adjusted to produce a steady 150% starting torque from standstill right up to full speed. However, motor cooling deteriorates and can result in overheating as speed decreases such that prolonged <b>low-speed</b> operation with significant torque is not usually possible without separately motorized fan ventilation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Low-speed</b> (LS) rate of 1.5Mbit/s {{is defined}} by USB1.0. It {{is very similar to}} full-bandwidth {{operation}} except each bit takes 8 times as long to transmit. It is intended primarily to save cost in low-bandwidth human interface devices (HID) such as keyboards, mice, and joysticks.|$|E
5|$|The engine can {{accommodate}} high-load operating conditions {{and has been}} designed for <b>low-speed</b> operation. It can carry up to 260kilograms. The hovercraft is equipped with GPS and the construction costs are lower than usual {{for this type of}} vehicle.|$|E
5|$|For <b>low-speed</b> (1.5Mbit/s) and full-speed (12Mbit/s) devices the {{shortest}} {{time for a}} transaction in one direction is 1ms. High-speed (480Mbit/s) uses transactions within each micro frame (125µs) where using 1-byte interrupt packet results in a minimal response time of 940ns. 4-byte interrupt packet results in 984ns.|$|E
5|$|The XF4H-1 was {{designed}} to carry four semi-recessed AAM-N-6 Sparrow III radar-guided missiles, and to be powered by two J79-GE-8 engines. As in the McDonnell F-101 Voodoo, the engines sat low in the fuselage to maximize internal fuel capacity and ingested air through fixed geometry intakes. The thin-section wing had a leading edge sweep of 45° and was equipped with blown flaps for better <b>low-speed</b> handling.|$|E
5|$|Having {{just nine}} turns, the fewest on the Formula One calendar, the circuit offers very few <b>low-speed</b> {{sections}} and gave teams {{an opportunity to}} push their power units to their potential. As in the previous year's event, and {{for the third straight}} event overall, the yellow-banded soft compound tyre were the prime dry selection while the red-banded supersoft compound were the option dry selection. Pirelli also supplied two wet weather compounds: the green-banded intermediate compound and the blue-banded full wet compound.|$|E
5|$|Hoping {{to attract}} a {{proposed}} ZAP electric vehicle manufacturing plant {{to the city of}} Franklin, Kentucky, Beshear issued an executive order permitting <b>low-speed</b> vehicles on many Kentucky roads in August 2008. The state also offered the company $48 million in tax incentives, contingent upon its delivering a promised 4,000 jobs. Construction of the proposed plant stalled, however, when GE Capital, a primary investor, pulled out of the project. ZAP officials maintained their intention to build the plant, but said they would also consider other states' proposals if they could not replace the $125 million commitment from GE.|$|E
5|$|In development, {{significant}} {{attention was}} given to the Tornado's short-field take-off and landing (STOL) performance. Germany, in particular, encouraged this design aspect. For shorter take-off and landing distances, the Tornado can sweep its wings forwards to the 25-degree position, and deploy its full-span flaps and leading edge slats to allow the aircraft to fly at slower speeds. These features, in combination with the thrust reverser-equipped engines, give the Tornado excellent <b>low-speed</b> handling and landing characteristics.|$|E
5|$|King George V {{had four}} sets of Parsons geared {{turbines}}. Two main turbines were arranged in series and drove a shaft through double helical gears. An astern turbine was incorporated in the exhaust casing of the low-pressure turbine, and a cruising turbine was coupled directly to the high-pressure turbine. A speed of 28.5 knots was expected at standard displacement and 27.5 knots at full-load displacement on normal output; corresponding speeds at overload condition were 29.25 and 28.25 knots respectively. The turbine unit was a <b>low-speed</b> type (2,257 rpm) coupled to a single reduction gear which produced 236 rpm at the propeller shaft.|$|E
5|$|Later {{production}} Tu-144 versions {{were more}} refined and competitive. They had retractable canards for better <b>low-speed</b> control, turbojet engines providing nearly the fuel efficiency {{and range of}} Concorde and {{a top speed of}} Mach 2.35. Passenger service commenced in November 1977, but after the 1978 crash the aircraft was taken out of service. The aircraft had an inherently unsafe structural design as a consequence of an automated production method chosen to simplify and speed up manufacturing.|$|E
5|$|On 1 October 1956 the Ministry of Supply asked Morgan {{to form a}} {{new study}} group, the Supersonic Transport Advisory Committee (STAC), with the {{explicit}} goal of developing a practical SST design and finding industry partners to build it. At the very first meeting, on 5 November 1956, {{the decision was made to}} fund the development of a test bed aircraft to examine the <b>low-speed</b> performance of the slender delta, a contract that eventually produced the Handley Page HP.115. This aircraft would ultimately demonstrate safe control at speeds as low as 69mph, about ⅓ that of the F-104 Starfighter.|$|E
5|$|A {{design team}} {{was formed in}} 1946 under the {{leadership}} of chief designer Ronald Bishop, who had been responsible for the Mosquito fighter-bomber. A number of unorthodox configurations were considered, ranging from canard to tailless designs; all were subsequently rejected. The Ministry of Supply was, however, interested in the most radical of the proposed designs and ordered two experimental tailless DH 108s to serve as proof of concept aircraft for testing swept-wing configurations in both <b>low-speed</b> and high-speed flight. During flight tests, the DH 108 gained a reputation for being accident-prone and unstable, leading de Havilland and BOAC to gravitate to conventional configurations and, necessarily, designs with less technical risk. The DH 108s were later modified to test the DH 106's power controls.|$|E
5|$|During {{the flight}} test program, unlike the YF-23, weapon firings and high (60°) {{angle of attack}} (AoA, or high-Alpha) flights were carried out on the YF-22. Though not a requirement, the {{aircraft}} fired AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles from internal weapon bays. Flight testing also demonstrated that the YF-22 with its thrust vectoring nozzles achieved pitch rates more than double that of the F-16 at <b>low-speed</b> maneuvering. The first prototype, PAV-1, achieved Mach1.58 in supercruise, while PAV-2 reached a maximum supercruise speed of Mach1.43; maximum speed was in excess of Mach 2.0. Flight testing continued until 28December1990, by which time 74 flights were completed and 91.6 airborne hours were accumulated. Following flight testing, the contractor teams submitted proposals for ATF production.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} the Tornado to perform well as a {{low-level}} supersonic strike aircraft, it was considered necessary for it to possess good high-speed and <b>low-speed</b> flight characteristics. To achieve high-speed performance, a swept or delta wing is typically adopted, but these wing designs are inefficient at low speeds. To operate at both high and low speeds with great effectiveness, the Tornado uses a variable-sweep wing. This approach had been adopted by earlier aircraft, such as the American General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark strike fighter, and the Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 fighter. The F-111 has many similarities with the smaller Tornado; however, the Tornado differs in being a multi-role aircraft with more advanced onboard systems and avionics.|$|E
5|$|The Collins-class {{submarines}} {{experienced a}} wide range of problems during their construction and early service life. Many of these were attributed to the submarines being a new, untested design, and were successfully addressed as they were discovered. Most systems and features worked with few or no problems, while the boats' maximum speed, manoeuvrability, and <b>low-speed</b> submerged endurance were found to exceed specifications. The ship control system, which during development had been marked as a major potential problem, functioned beyond positive expectation: for example, the autopilot (which aboard Collins was nicknamed 'Sven') was found to be better at maintaining depth during snorting than most helmsmen.|$|E
5|$|The Texas Chain Saw Massacre {{was mainly}} shot using an Eclair NPR 16mm camera with fine-grain, <b>low-speed</b> film that {{required}} {{four times more}} light than modern digital cameras. Most of the filming {{took place in the}} farmhouse, which was filled with furniture constructed from animal bones and a latex material used as upholstery to give the appearance of human skin. The house was not cooled, and there was little ventilation. The crew covered its walls with drops of animal blood obtained from a local slaughterhouse. Art director Robert A. Burns drove around the countryside and collected the remains of cattle and other animals in various stages of decomposition, with which he littered the floors of the house.|$|E
5|$|The first XF-104 (Lockheed 083-1001, s/n 53-7786) was {{transported to}} Edwards AFB amidst high secrecy {{during the night}} of 24–25 February, where Lockheed test pilot Tony LeVier was to do the initial testing. On 28 February 1954, the XF-104 made a planned hop of about five ft off the ground during a {{high-speed}} taxi, but its first official flight took place on 4 March. During that flight, the landing gear did not retract, and LeVier landed after a <b>low-speed</b> flight of about 20 minutes. Adjustments and further flights discovered that the problem was low pressure in the hydraulic system. Bad weather kept the XF-104 on the ground until 26 March, when further flights were carried out with the landing gear retracting normally.|$|E
5|$|The lack {{of modern}} {{conventional}} attack capability prompted {{calls for a}} specialized attack aircraft. On 7 June 1961, Secretary of Defense McNamara ordered the air force to develop two tactical aircraft, one for the long-range strike and interdictor role, and the other focusing on the fighter-bomber mission. The former became the Tactical Fighter Experimental, or TFX, which emerged as the F-111, while the second was filled by {{a version of the}} U.S. Navy's F-4 Phantom II. While the Phantom would go on {{to be one of the}} most successful fighter designs of the 1960s, and proved to be a capable fighter-bomber, its lack of loiter time was a major problem, and to a lesser extent, its poor <b>low-speed</b> performance. It was also expensive to buy and operate, with a flyaway cost of $2 million in FY1965, and operational costs over $900 per hour.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 study {{conducted}} by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists have higher incidence rates for hybrid electric vehicles than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in <b>low-speed</b> vehicle maneuvers such as reversing or leaving a parking zone. These accidents commonly occurred in zones with low speed limits, during daytime and in clear weather. The study found that a HEV was two {{times more likely to be}} involved in a pedestrian crash than was a conventional ICE vehicle when a vehicle is slowing or stopping, backing up, or entering or leaving a parking space. Vehicle maneuvers were grouped in one category considering those maneuvers that might have occurred at very low speeds where the difference between the sound levels produced by the hybrid versus ICE vehicle is the greatest. Also the study found that the incidence rate of pedestrian crashes in scenarios when vehicles make a turn was significantly higher for HEVs when compared to ICE vehicles. Similarly, The NHTSA study also concluded that the incidence rate of bicyclist crashes involving HEVs for the same kind of maneuvers was significantly higher when compared to conventional vehicles.|$|E
5|$|On 8 September 1966, General McConnell {{ordered that}} a {{specialized}} CAS aircraft be designed, developed, and obtained; on 22 December, a Requirements Action Directive (RAD) was issued for the A-X CAS airplane, and the Attack Experimental (A-X) program office was formed. On 6 March 1967, the Air Force released {{a request for}} information to 21 defense contractors for the A-X. The objective {{was to create a}} design study for a low-cost attack aircraft. In 1969, the Secretary of the Air Force asked Pierre Sprey to write the detailed specifications for the proposed A-X project; Sprey's initial involvement was kept secret due to his earlier controversial involvement in the F-X project. Sprey's discussions with Skyraider pilots operating in Vietnam and analysis of aircraft used in the role indicated the ideal aircraft should have long loiter time, <b>low-speed</b> maneuverability, massive cannon firepower, and extreme survivability; possessing the best elements of the Ilyushin Il-2, Henschel Hs 129, and Skyraider. The specifications also demanded that each aircraft cost less than $3million. Sprey required that the biography of World War II Luftwaffe attack pilot Hans-Ulrich Rudel be read by people on the A-X program.|$|E
5|$|By the 38th lap, {{drivers who}} made their stops during the safety car period entered into their {{electrical}} energy conservation phase. Andretti chose {{to allow their}} drivers {{to remain on the}} circuit {{for as long as possible}} and their strategy allowed Félix da Costa and Frijns to catch and overtake d'Ambrosio and Turvey for the fifth and sixth positions in the event's closing period. Félix da Costa then attempted to catch the fourth-placed Prost but was unable to get close to him. As the field began the final lap, di Grassi, Heidfeld and Prost had five percent of usage electrical energy remaining and Buemi was unchallenged for the remainder of the race to secure the victory. Di Grassi finished second, ahead of Heidfeld in third. Prost was fourth and Félix da Costa fifth. Frijns, d'Ambrosio, Turvey, Engel and Sarrazin rounded out the top ten points-scoring positions. Piquet, Carroll filled the next two positions. Bird was fast enough to unlap himself by passing the race leaders, despite spinning his tyres at the circuit's <b>low-speed</b> exit turns, and finished in 13th. Duval and Rosenqvist were the last of the classified finishers. It was Buemi's first victory of the season and the seventh of his career. There were three lead changes in the race; four drivers reached the front of the field. Buemi led once for a total of 20 laps, more than any other competitor. Of the two other retirements, Vergne stopped with an overheating battery, and Abt lost all electrical energy in his car after 34 laps.|$|E

25|$|The <b>low-speed</b> concept {{allowed the}} design to {{dispense}} with several features normally found on jet aircraft, notably the sweptback wing. By using a conventional rectangular wing the high-speed drag was greatly increased (see wave drag) but the <b>low-speed</b> lift was likewise greatly increased. Further, the rectangular planform allowed the twin wing spars to be single pieces, {{and all of the}} engines, landing gear and cargo could be attached directly to the spar. With a swept wing this would place considerable torque loads on the point where the wings met the fuselage.|$|E
25|$|Living {{streets and}} {{complete}} streets {{provide for the}} needs of car drivers secondarily to the needs of users of the street as a whole. They are designed to be shared by pedestrians, playing children, bicyclists, and <b>low-speed</b> motor vehicles.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese Linimo HSST, cost {{approximately}} US$100 million/km to build. Besides offering improved {{operation and}} maintenance costs over other transit systems, these <b>low-speed</b> maglevs provide ultra-high levels of operational reliability and introduce little noise and generate zero air pollution into dense urban settings.|$|E
25|$|The {{units were}} also fitted with {{batteries}} {{to allow them}} to operate over the short-distance of non-electrified line at the quayside. The batteries allowed the units to be used at <b>low-speed</b> for 20–30 minutes, and could be recharged when the unit was taking power from 750V DC third-rail.|$|E
25|$|The Galilean transformations {{and their}} {{consequent}} commonsense law of addition of velocities {{work well in}} our ordinary <b>low-speed</b> world of planes, cars and balls.
