5|$|By 900 BC, Archaic {{people lived}} at Atlatl Cave and like sites. They <b>left</b> <b>little</b> {{evidence}} of their presence in Chaco Canyon. By AD 490, their descendants, of the Late Basketmaker II Era, farmed lands around Shabik'eshchee Village and other pit-house settlements at Chaco.|$|E
5|$|Certain areas began {{preparing}} for the storm along Florida's west coast. Hospitals set up emergency facilities in case of power failure, and some coastal residents left their homes. Initially, the storm was forecast to strike the Tampa area, but missed to the north as it weakened. It reportedly <b>left</b> <b>little</b> damage in the sparsely populated land where it made landfall.|$|E
5|$|During the 2004–05 lockout, Henrik {{returned}} to Sweden {{to play for}} Modo with Daniel and their Canucks teammate Markus Näslund. During a game against Mora IK on 20 November 2004, Henrik received a slash that required a minor amputation to his <b>left</b> <b>little</b> finger. He finished the season with 36points in 44games, third in team scoring behind Peter Forsberg and Mattias Weinhandl.|$|E

5|$|In Jamaica, the {{hurricane}} dropped heavy rainfall but <b>left</b> <b>little</b> damage. Rains in the Dominican Republic caused flooding in the country's southwest portion. Flooding around Les Cayes in southwestern Haiti destroyed 60percent of the rice, corn, and banana plantations, while high waves wrecked several houses in Cavaellon.|$|E
5|$|Like their garage rock predecessors, {{these local}} scenes were {{facilitated}} by enthusiastic impresarios who operated nightclubs or organized concerts in venues such as schools, garages, or warehouses, advertised via inexpensively printed flyers and fanzines. In some cases, punk's {{do it yourself}} ethic reflected an aversion to commercial success, {{as well as a}} desire to maintain creative and financial autonomy. As Joe Harvard, a participant in the Boston scene, describes, it was often a simple necessity—the absence of a local recording industry and well-distributed music magazines <b>left</b> <b>little</b> recourse but DIY.|$|E
5|$|Paleoenvironmental {{evidence}} shows that between the 9th and 11th centuries the area around Buckton Castle was cleared of woodland. This <b>left</b> <b>little</b> timber, and may have factored into the use of stone as a building material. The earliest castles in England typically used timber, at least {{when they were first}} built, and building in stone was more expensive than earth and timber. It became more common to use stone in 12th-century castles, and Buckton is amongst the earliest masonry castles in North West England.|$|E

5|$|Pierce {{was finally}} {{allowed to return}} to Concord in late December 1847. He was given a hero's welcome in his home state and issued his {{resignation}} from the Army, which was approved on March 20, 1848. His military exploits elevated his popularity in New Hampshire, but his injuries and subsequent troubles in battle led to accusations of cowardice which would long follow him. He had demonstrated competence as a general, especially in the initial march from Vera Cruz, but his short tenure and his injury <b>left</b> <b>little</b> for historians to judge his ability as a military commander.|$|E
5|$|The West Pier Trust {{now owns}} the pier and has {{proposed}} various plans to renovate it. Some schemes have been opposed by local residents {{and the owners}} of the nearby Palace Pier, who have claimed unfair competition. The pier gradually collapsed during the early 21st century. Major sections collapsed in late 2002, and two fires in March and May 2003 <b>left</b> <b>little</b> of the original structure. Subsequently, English Heritage declared it to be beyond repair. Structured demolition took place in 2010 {{to make way for the}} observation tower i360; further structural damage from storms has occurred since.|$|E
5|$|The {{duration}} of the pandemic and the war could have also played a role. The disease would usually only affect a certain area for a month before leaving, while the war, which most had initially expected to end quickly, had lasted for four years {{by the time the}} pandemic struck. This <b>left</b> <b>little</b> time for the disease to {{have a significant impact on}} the economy.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} of the fort was artificially raised by the Romans, using earth dug from the foundation ditch, {{to bring it up}} {{to the level of the}} projecting step on the back of the wall. No evidence of significant buildings within the fort has been found by excavators. A number of Roman hearths are situated at regular intervals in the centre of the fort's interior, suggesting that they may have been the site of wooden barrack blocks. The buildings are conjectured to have been largely timber-framed wattle and daub structures which have <b>left</b> <b>little</b> trace.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} storm {{of the season}} was Hurricane Eloise, a Category3 hurricane that struck the Florida Panhandle at peak intensity, after bringing severe flooding to the Caribbean. Eloise caused 80fatalities, including 34in Puerto Rico, 7in Dominican Republic, 18in Haiti, and 21in the United States, with 4in Florida. The hurricane left about $560million in damage in the United States. Hurricane Gladys, a Category4 hurricane, was the most intense tropical cyclone of the season, but <b>left</b> <b>little</b> impact on land. Two tropical depressions also caused damage and fatalities. Collectively, the tropical cyclones of this result resulted in 87deaths and about $564.7million in damage.|$|E
5|$|Barrowclough's {{opportunity}} {{for a return to}} duty overseas came following the death of Mead in an aircraft crash in July 1942. At the time of Mead's death, the Pacific Section was being recalled to New Zealand for reorganisation into a division for offensive operations in the South Pacific. In August, Barrowclough was named as commander of what was now known as the 3rd New Zealand Division. He immediately overhauled its structure and removed many officers who he considered too old for frontline duty, replacing them with personnel who had experience with the 2NZEF in Greece, Crete or North Africa. He also implemented training programs for his new command; most of its personnel had been engaged in the construction of fortifications while in Fiji, which had <b>left</b> <b>little</b> {{opportunity for}} intensive tactical training and exercises.|$|E

5|$|During her lifetime, Sarah drafted twenty-six wills, {{the last}} of which was only written {{a few months before}} her death; and had {{purchased}} twenty-seven estates. With a wealth of over £4 million in land; £17,000 in rent rolls; and a further £12,500 in annuities, she made financial bequests to rising Whig ministers such as William Pitt, later the first Earl of Chatham, and Philip Stanhope, the fourth Earl of Chesterfield. Although she <b>left</b> <b>little</b> to the poor and even less to charity, she left her servants annuities far above the average for the time: her favourite, Grace Ridley, received £16,000, equivalent to approximately £1.32million in today's money.|$|E
5|$|Lyfjaberg {{is where}} the goddess sits {{surrounded}} by her helpful spirits. Although healing by a goddess—or indeed by a god either—has <b>left</b> <b>little</b> mark on Norse myths as they have come down to us, {{there is no doubt}} that the healing power of goddesses was of enormous importance in daily life in the pre-Christian period, as was that of many women saints in Christian times. The goddess who presided over childbirth was held to possess power over life and death, and was revered as a lifegiver, both in the family home and in the courts of kings, though she might also pass sentence of death.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} tropical cyclone of the season, {{known as the}} Matagorda hurricane, developed on August23. After striking the Yucatán Peninsula, the storm entered the Gulf of Mexico and intensified into a Category3 hurricane on Saffir–Simpson scale, becoming the only major hurricane of the season. The hurricane devastated southern Texas, with damage as far inland as San Antonio. Eight fatalities and about $26.5million in damage were reported. Several of the proceeding tropical systems <b>left</b> <b>little</b> impact on land, though {{the remnants of the}} ninth tropical storm contributed to severe flooding in Virginia. In November, a hurricane caused extensive impact in several coastal communities of Belize (then known as British Honduras). The hurricane left nine deaths and about $4million in damage.|$|E

5|$|Though {{inhabited}} {{prior to}} the 16th century, {{little is known about}} Barbadian music before the arrival of the Portuguese in 1536 and then the English in 1627. The Portuguese <b>left</b> <b>little</b> influence, but English culture and music helped shape the island's heritage. Irish and Scottish settlers emigrated in the 17th century, working in the tobacco industry, bringing still more new music to the island. The middle of the 17th century saw the decline of the tobacco industry and the rise of sugarcane, as well as the introduction of large numbers of African slaves. Brazilian exiles however, along with sugarcane introduced Samba to the island which featured a mixture of Latin music with African influences which soon developed into Soca-Samba which is indigenous to Barbados. Modern Barbadian music is thus largely a combination of English and African elements, with Irish, Scottish, and modern American and Caribbean (especially Jamaican) influences as well.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Elena brought {{flooding}} to the Greater Houston area, {{with five}} deaths and about $10million in damage. However, little impact was reported elsewhere. Hurricane Henri remained offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and disrupted efforts {{to stop the}} Ixtoc I oil spill. Henri also caused flooding in portions of Mexico. In mid and late-September, a tropical depression caused flooding in the Southern United States, especially Texas. Four deaths were reported, two in Texas and two in Kentucky. Toward the end of October, a brief subtropical storm struck Newfoundland, but <b>left</b> <b>little</b> impact. Other than Tropical Depression One and the tropical depression that brought flooding to the Southern United States in mid and late-September, {{none of the other}} depressions caused significant effects of land. Collectively, the tropical cyclones of the season resulted in $4.63billion in damage and at least 2,136deaths. Pacific Storm Blanca originated in the basin.|$|E
5|$|Commoners are {{estimated}} to have comprised over 90% of the population, but relatively {{little is known about}} them. Their houses were generally constructed from perishable materials, and their remains have <b>left</b> <b>little</b> trace in the archaeological record. Some commoner dwellings were raised on low platforms, and these can be identified, but an unknown quantity of commoner houses were not. Such low-status dwellings can only be detected by extensive remote-sensing surveys of apparently empty terrain. The range of commoners was broad; it consisted of everyone not of noble birth, and therefore included everyone from the poorest farmers to wealthy craftsmen and commoners appointed to bureaucratic positions. Commoners engaged in essential production activities, including that of products destined for use by the elite, such as cotton and cacao, as well as subsistence crops for their own use, and utilitarian items such as ceramics and stone tools. Commoners took part in warfare, and could advance socially by proving themselves as outstanding warriors. Commoners paid taxes to the elite in the form of staple goods such as maize flour and game. It is likely that hard-working commoners who displayed exceptional skills and initiative could become influential members of Maya society.|$|E
