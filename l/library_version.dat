500|$|In the US three {{publishers}} {{turned the}} book down before Macmillan Publishing Co offered Fleming a deal. Casino Royale was published on 23 March 1954 in the US, but sales were poor, totalling only 4,000 copies {{across the entire}} US {{during the course of}} the year. When the novel was released as a US paperback in 1955, it was re-titled by publisher American Popular Library; Fleming's suggestions for a new title, The Double-O Agent and The Deadly Gamble, were disregarded in favour of You Asked for It, but this marketing ploy failed to raise the interest. The Popular <b>Library</b> <b>version</b> also changed Bond's name, calling him [...] "Jimmy Bond".|$|E
2500|$|Package {{management}} {{systems such as}} NPM and Bower are popular with JavaScript developers. Such systems allow a developer to easily manage their program's dependencies upon other developer's program libraries. Developers trust that the maintainers of the libraries will keep it secure and up to date, {{but that is not}} always the case. A vulnerability has emerged because of this blind trust. Relied upon libraries can release an update that causes bugs or vulnerabilities to appear in all programs that rely upon the library. Inversely, a library can go unpatched with known vulnerabilities out in the wild. In a study done looking over a sample of 133k websites, researchers found 37% of the websites included a library with at-least one known vulnerability. [...] "The median lag between the oldest <b>library</b> <b>version</b> used on each website and the newest available version of that library is 1,177 days in ALEXA, and development of some libraries still in active use ceased years ago." [...] Another possibility is that the maintainer of a library may remove the library entirely. This occurred in March 2016 when Azer Koçulu removed his repository from NPM. This caused all tens of thousands of programs and websites depending upon his libraries to break.|$|E

5000|$|Windows File Protection {{introduced}} in Windows 2000 prevented applications from overwriting system DLLs. Developers were instead encouraged to use [...] "Private DLLs", copies of libraries per application in the directory of the application. This uses the Windows search path characteristic {{that the local}} path is always prioritized before the system directory with the system wide libraries. This allows easy and effective shadowing of <b>library</b> <b>versions</b> by specific application one, therefore preventing dependency hell.|$|R

50|$|A {{key feature}} of this {{interface}} is to produce top quality EI spectra from compounds dissolved in a liquid phase. In this case, quality is intended {{as a measure of}} the degree of success in a virtual comparison with thousands of spectra stored in the electronic libraries. Identification capability in real-world applications, when peaks are small and noise is high, can be greatly influenced by the quality of ionization. A NIST <b>library</b> <b>version</b> 2.0d was used for comparison. In this case, identification capability is not compromised by the presence of solvent vapor residues and matching quality tops that of a typical GC-MS system.|$|E
