40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma {{thesis is}} to {{describe}} various methods for examining <b>loci</b> <b>of</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> given properties. I have chosen both the classical approach and new technologies such as dynamic geometry software GeoGebra or a programme from CAS (Computer Algebra System). The topic <b>loci</b> <b>of</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> given properties is often very difficult for pupils to understand, therefore {{it is important to}} look at it from various <b>points</b> <b>of</b> view, to choose interesting application tasks and thus motivate learners in their studies. In this paper I present several suggestions for more attractive and amusing ways of teaching this issue at primary, secondary and university level of education...|$|R

25|$|An {{interval}} {{can also}} {{be defined as a}} <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> <b>points</b> at a given distance from the centre, and this definition can be extended from real numbers to complex numbers. As it is the case with computing with real numbers, computing with complex numbers involves uncertain data. So, given the fact that an interval number is a real closed interval and a complex number is an ordered pair of real numbers, {{there is no reason to}} limit the application of interval arithmetic to the measure of uncertainties in computations with real numbers. Interval arithmetic can thus be extended, via complex interval numbers, to determine regions of uncertainty in computing with complex numbers.|$|E
25|$|Abu Ali al-Hasan ibn al-Haytham {{is known}} in the West as Alhazen, born in 965 in Persia and dying in 1039 in Egypt. He {{is known as the}} father of optics for his {{writings}} on, and experiments with, lenses, mirrors, refraction, and reflection. He correctly stated that vision results from light that is reflected into the eye by an object, not emitted by the eye itself and reflected back, as Aristotle believed. He solved the problem of finding the <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> <b>points</b> on a spherical mirror from which light will be reflected to an observer. From his studies of refraction, he determined that the atmosphere has a definite height and that twilight is caused by refraction of solar radiation from beneath the horizon.|$|E

2500|$|In his {{influential}} mathematics book Geometry, Descartes solves {{a problem}} that was worked on by Apollonius of Perga and Pappus of Alexandria. Given n lines L and a point P(L) on each line, find the <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> <b>points</b> Q such that the lengths of the line segments QP(L) satisfy certain conditions. [...] For example, when n = 4, given the lines a, b, c, and d and a point A on a, B on b, and so on, find the <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> <b>points</b> Q such that the product QA*QB equals the product QC*QD. When the lines are not all parallel, Pappus showed that the loci are conics, but when Descartes considered larger n, he obtained cubic and higher degree curves. To show that the cubic curves were interesting, he showed that they arose naturally in optics from Snell's law.|$|E

2500|$|Manifolds {{need not}} be closed; thus a line segment without its end points is a manifold. And they are never countable, unless the {{dimension}} of the manifold isnbsp&0.

2500|$|If {{the field}} F is not algebraically closed, {{the point of}} view of {{function}} fields is a little more general than that of considering the <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> <b>points,</b> since we include, for instance, [...] "curves" [...] with no points on them. For example, if the base field F is the field R of real numbers, then x2+y2=−1 defines an algebraic extension field of R(x), but the corresponding curve considered as a subset of R2 has no points. The equation x2+y2=−1 does define an irreducible algebraic curve over R in the scheme sense (an integral, separated one-dimensional schemes of finite type over R). In this sense, the one-to-one correspondence between irreducible algebraic curves over F (up to birational equivalence) and algebraic function fields in one variable over F holds in general.|$|E

2500|$|Since O(4) acts on R4 by {{orthogonal}} transformations, we {{can move}} the [...] "standard" [...] Clifford torus defined above to other equivalent tori via rigid rotations. [...] These are all called [...] "Clifford tori". The six-dimensional group O(4) acts transitively on the space of all such Clifford tori sitting inside the 3-sphere. [...] However, this action has a two-dimensional stabilizer (see group action) since rotation in the meridional and longitudinal directions of a torus preserves the torus (as opposed to moving it to a different torus). [...] Hence, there is actually a four-dimensional space of Clifford tori. In fact, there is a one-to-one correspondence between Clifford tori in the unit 3-sphere and pairs of polar great circles (i.e., great circles that are maximally separated). [...] Given a Clifford torus, the associated polar great circles are the core circles {{of each of the}} two complementary regions. Conversely, given any pair of polar great circles, the associated Clifford torus is the <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> <b>points</b> of the 3-sphere that are equidistant from the two circles.|$|E
