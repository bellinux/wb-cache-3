40|$|Modern {{software}} development and run-time environments, such as Java and the Microsoft. NET Common Language Runtime (CLR), {{have adopted a}} declarative form of access control. Permissions are granted to code providers, and during execution, the platform verifies compatibility between the permissions required by a security-sensitive operation and those granted to the executing code. While convenient, configuring the access-control policy of a program is not easy. If a code component is not granted sufficient permissions, authorization failures may occur. Thus, security administrators tend to define overly permissive policies, which violate the Principle of Least Privilege (PLP). A considerable body of research {{has been devoted to}} building program-analysis tools for computing the optimal policy for a program. However, Java and the CLR also allow executing code under the authority of a subject (user or service), and no program-analysis solution has addressed the challenges of determining the policy of a program in the presence of subjects. This paper introduces Subject Access Rights Analysis (SARA), a novel analysis algorithm for statically computing the permissions required by subjects at run time. We have applied SARA to 348 libraries in IBM WebSphere Application Server - a commercial enterprise application server written in Java that consists of > 2 million lines of code and is required to support the Java permission- and subject-based security model. SARA detected 263 PLP violations, 219 cases of policies with missing permissions, and 29 bugs that <b>led</b> <b>code</b> to be unnecessarily executed under the authority of a subject. SARA corrected all these vulnerabilities automatically, and additionally synthesized fresh policies for all the libraries, with a false-positive rate of 5 % and an average running time of 103 seconds per library. SARA also implements mechanisms for mitigating the risk of false negatives due to reflection and native code; according to a thorough result evaluation based on testing, no false negative was detected. SARA enabled IBM WebSphere Application Server to receive the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation Assurance Level 4 certification...|$|E

50|$|The Alpha {{architecture}} has a two-step {{approach to}} unaligned loads and stores. The {{first step is}} to load the upper and lower memory words into separate registers. The second step is to extract or modify the memory words using special low/high instructions similar to the MIPS instructions. An unaligned store is completed by storing the modified memory words back to memory. The reason for this complexity is that the original Alpha architecture could only read or write 32-bit or 64-bit values. This proved to be a severe limitation that often <b>led</b> to <b>code</b> bloat and poor performance. To address this limitation, an extension called the Byte Word Extensions (BWX) was added to the original architecture. It consisted of instructions for byte and word loads and stores.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the years}} that {{radioactive}} material (RAM) transportation risk estimates have been calculated using the RADTRAN code, demand for improved geographic resolution of route characteristics, especially density of population neighboring route segments, has <b>led</b> to <b>code</b> improvements that provide more specific route definition. With the advent of geographic information systems (GISs), the achievable resolution of route characteristics is theoretically very high. The authors have compiled population-density data in 1 -kilometer increments for routes extending over hundreds of kilometers without impractical expenditures of time. Achievable resolution of analysis is limited, however, by the resolution of available data. U. S. Census data typically have 1 -km or better resolution within densely-populated portions of metropolitan areas but census blocks are much larger in rural areas. Geographic resolution of accident-rate data, especially for heavy/combination trucks, are typically tabulated on a statewide basis.

40|$|Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) {{strengthening}} {{offers many}} well-documented {{benefits for the}} retrofit of existing reinforced concrete (RC) structures. The main drawback in using FRP for such applications, however, is the reduction in ductility capacity after strengthening. This loss in ductility has <b>led</b> worldwide <b>codes</b> to not consider redistribution of bending moments in continuous FRP-strengthened RC beams. This implies that an unstrengthened continuous RC beam that was previously designed under assumptions of moment redistribution (MR) and is to be strengthened with FRP must now be redesigned according to full elastic distribution of bending moments. This could lead to onerous conditions in such strengthening applications. This paper sets out a rationale for the possible appropriate use of redistribution principles for FRP-strengthened beams. Analytical results show that if a section can develop a curvature ductility capacity, greater than 2. 0, {{it is likely that}} redistribution in the order of at least 7. 5 % can be achieved.

Another purpose is to put the coding into the larger framework of information theory. And a third is to report on how the methodology for image compression was applied in a clinical setting where the medical issue was the measurement of major blood vessels in the chest and the tedhnology magnetic resonance imaging (MR). Measuring the sizes of blood vessels, other organs, and tumors is fundamental to evaluating aneurysms, especially prior to surgery. We argue for digital approaches to imaging in general, two benefits being improved archiving and transmission, and another improved clinical usefulness through the application of digital image processing.
