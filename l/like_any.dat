5|$|Borscht, <b>like</b> <b>any</b> other soup in East Slavic cuisines, {{is seldom}} eaten by itself, but rather {{accompanied}} by a side dish. At a minimum, spoonfuls of borscht are alternated with bites of a slice of bread. Buckwheat groats or boiled potatoes, often topped with pork cracklings, are other simple possibilities, but a range of more involved sides exists as well.|$|E
5|$|Demonstratives are {{similarly}} considered nominals in Wagiman, {{and take the}} same case suffixes depending on their semantic and syntactic roles; their function within the sentence. That is, the demonstrative mahan 'this', or 'here' (root: mayh-), may take case just <b>like</b> <b>any</b> other nominal.|$|E

5|$|Israeli {{historian}} Omer Bartov, {{writing for}} The New York Times Book Review, judged The Holocaust Industry to be marred {{by the same}} errors he denounces in those who exploit the Holocaust for profit or politics:It is filled with {{precisely the kind of}} shrill hyperbole that Finkelstein rightly deplores in much of the current media hype over the Holocaust; it is brimming with the same indifference to historical facts, inner contradictions, strident politics and dubious contextualizations; and it oozes with the same smug sense of moral and intellectual superiority... <b>Like</b> <b>any</b> conspiracy theory, it contains several grains of truth; and <b>like</b> <b>any</b> such theory, it is both irrational and insidious.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>any</b> organism, {{marine mammals}} are {{susceptible}} to viral infections. In 1988 and 2002, thousands of harbour seals were killed in Europe by phocine distemper virus.

5|$|A typical day-to-day {{traditional}} {{vegetarian meal}} of Uttar Pradesh, <b>like</b> <b>any</b> other North Indian thali, consists of roti (flatbread), chawal, dal, sabji, raita and papad. Many people still drink the traditional drink chaach (traditional Butter milk) with meals. On festive occasions, usually 'tava' (flat pan for roti) is considered inauspicious, and instead fried foods are consumed. A typical festive thali consists of Puri, Kachauri, sabji, pulav, papad, raita, salad and desserts (such as sewai or Kheer).|$|E
5|$|Apple {{claims that}} the battery can provide up to 10hours of video, 140hours of audio playback, or one month on standby; people say the battery lasts about 8hours doing normal tasks. <b>Like</b> <b>any</b> {{rechargeable}} battery, the iPad's battery loses capacity over time. However, the iPad's battery is not user-replaceable. In a program similar to iPod and iPhone battery-replacement programs, Apple promised to replace an iPad that does not hold an electrical charge with a refurbished unit for a fee of US$99 plus $6.95 shipping. User data is not preserved/transferred. The refurbished unit comes with a new case. The warranty on the refurbished unit may vary between jurisdictions.|$|E

5|$|Carrots {{benefit from}} {{strongly}} scented companion plants. The pungent odour of onions, leeks and chives help repel the carrot root fly, and other vegetables that team well with carrots include lettuce, tomatoes and radishes, {{as well as}} the herbs rosemary and sage. Carrots thrive in the presence of caraway, coriander, chamomile, marigold and Swan River daisy. They can also be good companions for other plants; if left to flower, the carrot, <b>like</b> <b>any</b> umbellifer, attracts predatory wasps that kill many garden pests.|$|E

5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>any</b> alliance, NATO is {{ultimately}} governed by its 29 member states.

Several countries have diplomatic missions to NATO through embassies in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>any</b> other mint the New Orleans Mint was {{a factory}} to make coins.

Until it {{was taken over by}} the Confederacy in 1861 it {{produced}} many different denominations, all of which were either silver or gold: silver three-cent pieces (1851 only), half dimes, dimes, quarters, half dollars, silver dollars, gold dollars, $2.50 quarter eagles, three-dollar pieces, $5 half-eagles, $10 eagles, and $20 double eagles.|$|E
5|$|Modern historiographical {{practice}} {{distinguishes between}} chattel slavery (personal possession, where the slave {{was regarded as}} a piece of property as opposed to a mobile member of society) versus land-bonded groups such as the penestae of Thessaly or the Spartan helots, who were more like medieval serfs (an enhancement to real estate). The chattel helot is an individual deprived of liberty and forced to submit to an owner, who may buy, sell, or lease them <b>like</b> <b>any</b> other chattel.|$|E

5|$|The album's cover was, like {{several other}} Pink Floyd albums, {{designed}} by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. It {{consists of a}} photograph of a man sitting in a tree which has been taken out of focus to the point of complete distortion. Hipgnosis viewed a number of stills from the film on a 35mm projector, and liked the visual effect when the slide jammed. Schroeder later said the band did not want to make the cover particularly good as The Dark Side of the Moon would have to compete with it, but Thorgerson insisted it was given proper consideration <b>like</b> <b>any</b> other Floyd album.|$|E
5|$|The {{alveolar}} bone is the bone of the jaw which forms the alveolus around teeth. <b>Like</b> <b>any</b> other bone {{in the human}} body, {{alveolar bone}} is modified throughout life. Osteoblasts create bone and osteoclasts destroy it, especially if force is placed on a tooth. As is the case when movement of teeth is attempted through orthodontics, an area of bone under compressive force from a tooth moving toward it has a high osteoclast level, resulting in bone resorption. An area of bone receiving tension from periodontal ligaments attached to a tooth moving away from it has {{a high number of}} osteoblasts, resulting in bone formation.|$|E
