5|$|The Briarcliff Farms office, Walter Law's {{personal}} office, {{was also}} the first dairy building; it burned down in 1901, and was rebuilt the following year. From Briarcliff Manor's 1902 incorporation to the construction of its first municipal building in 1913, the office housed the village government. During the 1960s the building was redesigned, rebuilt and became a <b>local</b> <b>union</b> headquarters for the International Union of Operating Engineers. The farm was enclosed, and its pastures were divided by stone walls from within the farm; the stones were also used for roadbeds, and for walls of the farm buildings, office, and Law's house.|$|E
5|$|George Orwell's book The Road to Wigan Pier was {{illustrated}} by {{a photograph of}} homes in the Rosehall area of Coatbridge. In 1934 there was an exodus to Corby in England when the <b>local</b> <b>Union</b> Plant relocated. This {{had the effect of}} a hammer blow impact on the town's iron industry and ushered in the end of serious iron production. The decline of the Clydeside shipbuilding industry in the 1950s meant the demand for iron finally collapsed. A legacy of 'devastating' unemployment, appalling housing conditions and some of the worst overcrowding in Scotland left its stamp on the Coatbridge of the early 1930s. As late as 1936 Coatbridge was the most overcrowded place in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Haywood {{observed}} {{how the government}} frequently took the side of business to defeat the tactics and the aspirations of the miners. During an 1899 organizing drive in Coeur d'Alene, with pay cuts as a motivating issue, the company hired spies and then fired organizers and pro-union miners. Some frustrated miners responded with violence and when two men were killed, martial law was declared. As they had done in a strike in Coeur d'Alene seven years earlier, soldiers acted as strike breakers. They rounded up hundreds of union members without formal charges {{and put them in}} a filthy, vermin-infested warehouse without sanitation services for a year. They were so crowded that the soldiers locked the overflow of prisoners in boxcars. One <b>local</b> <b>union</b> leader was imprisoned for 17 years.|$|E
50|$|Many <b>local</b> <b>unions</b> are {{affiliated}} with municipal, provincial, state, regional or national bodies. Often, these bodies levy their own dues on <b>local</b> <b>unions,</b> and a union member's dues may include the dues these other union organizations impose.|$|R

5|$|In 2008, Triumph International {{came under}} fire after a female {{president}} of a <b>local</b> <b>union</b> was dismissed in Thailand. She had appeared on a Thai evening television program with a T-shirt on which a political statement could be seen. The company's management had {{the view that the}} appearance had harmed their public image and therefore laid off the staff member in question. The international work council of the company, Triumph International Labor Union, protested and collected 2,500 signatures to petition for the rehiring of the union president, supported in solidarity in Germany, inter alia, by the ver.di youth. In November 2008, the Labor Court in Bangkok found the lay-off to have been lawful.|$|E
5|$|Melvin never married. He was {{a member}} of the Wheeling Shakespeare Club and was active in several Union veterans' {{organizations}} and reunions. In October 1871, Melvin delivered an address to welcome the soldiers and attendees of the Army of West Virginia Soldiers' Reunion in Wheeling. He was later a member of the Society of the Army of West Virginia, later known as the Army of West Virginia Association. In 1883, and again on September 9, 1897, Melvin was elected a vice president of the organization. Melvin was also a member of the 1st West Virginia Association, of which he was elected president on September 6, 1894. In addition, Melvin belonged to the Holliday Post of the Grand Army of the Republic and participated in the decoration of <b>local</b> <b>Union</b> graves on Memorial Day in 1897, 1898, and 1899.|$|E
5|$|This {{practice}} was replaced in 1900 by {{a far more}} complex system of assessments and donations designed {{to raise the money}} to support strikes. This system was replaced in 1901 because it was impractical. The 1901 system required every <b>local</b> <b>union</b> and the central committee to create strike funds. Local unions would receive support for strikes from Berlin under certain circumstances, and the central Business Committee's fund would be replenished by all member organizations in amounts proportional to their membership and the average wage of their members. This system, too, proved problematic because it penalized the larger, wealthier unions— especially the construction workers in Berlin who had higher wages but also higher costs of living. From 1901 to 1903, many small organizations joined the federation, yet the FVdG's membership fell as the punitive strike support system drove some larger unions out. In 1903, the federation not only changed its name to the Free Association of German Trade Unions but also decided to return to the old system of voluntary contributions. This system remained in place until 1914. The Business Committee worked to ensure that unions contributed as much as they could. Often the committee resorted to threatening unions with expulsion in order to raise funds for a strike. Fritz Kater called this a dictatorship necessary for the movement, but local organizations still had far more autonomy than their counterparts in other German labor federations.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{reason for}} the failure of <b>local</b> <b>unions</b> was due to a policy that {{required}} corporations to eliminate labor leaders from their ranks. [...] They did this by offering incentives to labor leaders. These included higher wages and promotions to superintendents. This method was successful in several localities and played a prominent role in the dismantling of <b>local</b> <b>unions.</b>|$|R

5|$|On July 23, 1864, Anderson led 65 men to Renick, Missouri, robbing {{stores and}} tearing down {{telegraph}} wires on the way. They {{had hoped to}} attack a train, but its conductor learned of their presence and turned back before reaching the town. The guerrillas then attacked Allen, Missouri. At least 40 members of the 17th Illinois Cavalry and the Missouri State Militia were in town but took shelter in a fort. The guerrillas were only able to shoot their horses before reinforcements arrived, killing three of Anderson's men. In late July, the Union military sent a force of 100 well-equipped soldiers, and 650 other men, after Anderson. On July 30, Anderson and his men kidnapped the elderly father of the <b>local</b> <b>Union</b> militia's commanding officer. They tortured him until he was near death and sent word to the man's son in an unsuccessful attempt to lure him into an ambush, before releasing the father with instructions to spread word of his mistreatment. On August 1, while searching for militia members, Anderson {{and some of his}} men stopped at a house full of women and requested food. While they rested at the house, a group of local men attacked. The guerrillas quickly forced the attackers to flee, and Anderson shot and injured one woman as she fled the house. This action angered his men, who saw themselves as the protectors of women, but Anderson dismissed their concerns, stating that such things were inevitable. They chased the men who had attacked them, killing one and mutilating his body. By August 1864, they were regularly scalping the men that they killed.|$|E

25|$|These {{assumptions}} doomed {{the organizing}} drive. The AFL did {{not account for}} the hardening anti-union attitudes of U.S. Steel executives and plant managers, and the federation had no real plan to counterbalance the vast financial resources the company would pour into anti-union espionage, strikebreaking and union avoidance measures. When the AFL did organize a <b>local</b> <b>union,</b> the federation's patronizing attitudes and management style alienated workers and left the <b>local</b> <b>union</b> powerless.|$|E

25|$|The {{fundamental}} unit of UE is the <b>local</b> <b>union.</b> Because UE {{was founded by}} existing independent local unions, the union is structured to provide {{a higher degree of}} autonomy to locals than in many other national unions. <b>Local</b> <b>union</b> members elect their local officers, negotiators, stewards, and delegates to the regional council and national convention; set policies for their local, including financial decisions; suggest bargaining demands and vote to approve the union’s full list of contract proposals; vote to ratify or reject contracts and supplemental agreements with the employer; and decide whether to strike, and when to end a strike, by majority vote.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, {{a number}} of AFSCME <b>local</b> <b>unions,</b> {{composed}} primarily of caseworkers, disaffiliated from that union and joined the CIO. The CIO allowed these <b>local</b> <b>unions</b> to form the State, County, and Municipal Workers of America (SCMWA), and charged the new organization with competing with AFSCME {{at the state and}} local levels for membership. Most of the leaders and many of the members of these <b>local</b> <b>unions</b> were strongly sympathetic to the beliefs and goals of the Communist Party USA. Former AFSCME executive board member Abram Flaxer was appointed the new union's president, and former AFSCME Secretary-Treasurer David Kanes held the same post in SCMWA. SCMWA membership grew quickly: It more than doubled the number of <b>local</b> <b>unions</b> (from 12 to 28) in a year, and its members rose from 25,000 in 1937 to more than 48,000 in 1946.
