They also have their own musical notation: not with <b>linear</b> <b>notation,</b> but with special signs—kriuki or znamena ("hooks" [...] or [...] "banners"; see Znamenny Chant). Old Believers practise several different types of Znamenny Chant: Stolpov Chant, Great Znamenny Chant, Lesser Znamenny Chant, Putevoi Chant, Pomorsky Chant (or Khomov Chant), Demestvenny Chant, etc. In this respect it represents a tradition that parallels the use of Byzantine chant and neumatic notation.|$|E

Each sign may {{include the following}} components: a large black hook or a black stroke, several smaller black 'points' and 'commas' and lines near the hook or crossing the hook. Some signs may mean only one note, some 2 to 4 notes, and some a whole melody of more than 10 notes with a complicated rhythmic structure.|$|E

50|$|The Russian {{influence}} on the music life in Kazakhstan {{can be seen in}} two spheres:First, the introduction of musical academic institutions such as concert houses with opera stages, conservatories, where the European music was performed and taught, second, by trying to incorporate Kazakh traditional music into these academic structures.Controlled by the Russian Empire and then the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan's folk and classical traditions became connected with ethnic Russian music and Western European music. Prior to the 20th century, Kazakh folk music was collected and studied by ethnographic research teams including composers, music critics and musicologists.

The notation requires a prior canonical numbering of the graph nodes based on the lengths of a longest path and path branches, and uses locants to designate branch positions and cyclicity.

An index which measures the similarity of a pair of graphs is defined based on a comparison of their linear codes...|$|E
40|$|The <b>linear</b> <b>notations</b> {{are more}} compact than {{connection}} tables {{so they can}} be useful for storing and transmitting large number of chemical structures. Implicitly they contain the information needed to compute all kinds of molecular structures and, thus, molecular properties derived from these structures. In this DOSM is a new method of obtaining a rough description of 2 D molecular structure from its 2 D connection graph in the form of character string. Our method is based on the fragmentation of DOSM strings into overlapping substrings of a defined size that we call LINGO-DOSM. The integral set of LINGO-DOSM derived from a given DOSM string, LINGO-DOSM allows rigorous structure specification using very small and simple rule. In this paper, we study the possibility of using the textual descriptor for describing the 2 D structure of the molecule. Simulated virtual screening experiments with the MDDR database show clearly the superiority of the LINGO-DOSM descriptor compared to many standard descriptors tested in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- Recently {{there are}} several reports that {{carbohydrate}} molecules take important biological roles in intercellular signal transduction, cell growth and differentiation. As a consequence, the analysis of carbohydrate sugar chains, or glycans are {{becoming one of the}} major problems in computational molecular biology. Collaboration among scientists are difficult because of the tree-like structure of glycans, which makes searching much more difficult than proteins or DNA. This paper presents a graphical user interface for MGrid-based Glyco-MGrid portal system, which is currently still in development, that supports simulation database for glycoconjugates. We also discuss a <b>linear</b> <b>notation</b> for glycan structure and an intuitive method to perform glycan structure matching...|$|E

The recog-nition of XMTEX commands as <b>linear</b> <b>notations</b> has led to the concept of the XM notation, which has further grown into XMML (XMMarkup Language) as a markup language for characterizing chemical structural formulas. XML (Ex-tensible Markup Language) documents with XMML are converted into HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) documents with XM notations, which are able to display chemical structural formulas in the Internet by means of the XMJava system developed as a Java applet of an internet browser. On the other hand, the same XML documents with XMML are converted into LATEX documents with XMTEX commands (the same as XMnotations), which are able to print out chem-ical structural formulas of high quality. Functions added by the latest version (4. 04) of XMTEX have enhanced abilities of drawing complicated structures such as steroids. LATEX documents with XMTEX formulas can be converted into PDF (Portable Document Format) documents directly or via PostScript document. Ap-plications of suchPDFdocuments in online or semi-online submission to scientific journals have been discussed. ...|$|R

Subtree pushdown automata [1] represent a complete index {{of a tree}} for subtrees. Subtree oracle pushdown automata, as inspired by string factor oracle automaton [2], have the number of states equal to n+ 1, where n is {{the length of a}} corresponding <b>linear</b> <b>notation</b> of the tree. This makes the space complexity very low. By analogy with the string factor oracle automaton the subtree oracle automata can also accept some subtrees which are not present in the given subject tree.

The presented pushdown automata are input–driven and therefore they can be determinised. I...|$|E

40|$|With {{growing amount}} of {{experimental}} data, {{the number of}} known protein structures also increases continuously. Classification of protein structures helps to understand relationships between protein structure and function. The main classification methods based on secondary structures are SCOP, CATH and TOPS, which all classify under different aspects, and therefore can lead to different results. We developed a mathematically unique representation of protein structure topologies at a higher abstraction level providing new aspects of classification and enabling for a fast search through the data. Protein Topology Graph Library (PTGL; [URL] aims at providing a database on protein secondary structure topologies, including search facilities, the visualization as intuitive topology diagrams {{as well as in}} the 3 D structure, and additional information. Secondary structure-based protein topologies are represented uniquely as undirected labeled graphs in four different ways allowing for exploration under different aspects. The <b>linear</b> <b>notations,</b> and the 2 D and 3 D diagrams of each notation facilitate a deeper understanding of protein topologies. Several search functions for topologies and sub-topologies, BLAST search possibility, and links to SCOP, CATH and PDBsum support individual and large-scale investigation of protein structures.
