25|$|A {{controversy}} over the assortment of operation theories {{dates back to the}} 18th century, when Benjamin Franklin himself stated that his <b>lightning</b> <b>protectors</b> protected buildings by dissipating electric charge.

Anyone struck by lightning was considered chosen by the god and, if they survived, a sheep was sacrificed in their honour. His festival was celebrated in the summer with the sacrifice of a lamb and a bull and the drinking of specially brewed beer. On that day women baked bread in silence as a mark of reverence.|$|R

5000|$|A {{lightning}} rod (or <b>lightning</b> <b>protector)</b> is a metal strip or rod connected to earth through conductors and a grounding system, {{used to provide}} a preferred pathway to ground if lightning terminates on a structure. The class of these products are often called a [...] "finial" [...] or [...] "air terminal". A {{lightning rod}} or [...] "Franklin rod" [...] in honor of its famous inventor, Benjamin Franklin, is simply a metal rod, and without being connected to the lightning protection system, as was sometimes {{the case in the}} old days, will provide no added protection to a structure. Other names include [...] "lightning conductor", [...] "arrester", and [...] "discharger"; however, over the years these names have been incorporated into other products or industries with a stake in lightning protection. Lightning arrester, for example, often refers to fused links that explode when a strike occurs to a high voltage overhead power line to protect the more expensive transformers down the line by opening the circuit. In reality, it was an early form of a heavy duty surge protection device (SPD). Modern arresters, constructed with metal oxides, are capable of safely shunting abnormally high voltage surges to ground while preventing normal system voltages from being shorted to ground.|$|E
25|$|An object {{outside the}} {{critical}} distance {{is unlikely to}} be struck by the leader if there is a solidly grounded object within the critical distance. Locations that are considered safe from lightning can be determined by imagining a leader's potential paths as a sphere that travels from the cloud to the ground. For lightning protection, it suffices to consider all possible spheres as they touch potential strike points. To determine strike points, consider a sphere rolling over the terrain. At each point, a potential leader position is simulated. Lightning is most likely to strike where the sphere touches the ground. Points that the sphere cannot roll across and touch are safest from <b>lightning.</b> <b>Lightning</b> <b>protectors</b> should be placed where they will prevent the sphere from touching a structure. A weak point in most lightning diversion systems is in transporting the captured discharge from the lightning rod to the ground, though. Lightning rods are typically installed around the perimeter of flat roofs, or along the peaks of sloped roofs at intervals of 6.1 m or 7.6 m, depending on the height of the rod. When a flat roof has dimensions greater than 15m by 15m, additional air terminals will be installed {{in the middle of the}} roof at intervals of 15m or less in a rectangular grid pattern.|$|R

The altar has a modern polychrome ceramic decoration by Vitali da Foligno and an organ from the 18th century.

The ceiling has a fresco painted by the Caprari of Osimo depicting a veduta of town of Santa Maria Nuova in the 1920s, {{as well as}} three saints venerated by peasants and herders: San Vincenzo Ferreri (<b>Protector</b> against <b>Lightning),</b> Sant'Emidio (<b>Protector</b> against earthquakes) e Sant'Antonio Abate (Protector of farm animals).|$|R
40|$|A {{cable system}} carries {{one or more}} {{insulated}} conductors completely enclosed within a shield having one end connected to ground. A <b>lightning</b> <b>protector</b> network connects {{the other end of}} the shield to ground. The protector network is normally open circuited and becomes only short circuited in response to a momentary abnormal surge voltage induced in the shield. The protector network's open to short impedance change completes a conductive circuit path between the shield and the two grounded ends for conducting a shield current which has the desired effect of protecting the signal carrying conductors in the cable from the large surge voltage...|$|E

In order to protect this highly sensitive equipment, a telephone <b>lightning</b> <b>protector</b> (MOV) has to be installed in the telephone set.

40|$|Purpose. Investigation of the {{formation}} of space charge in the region of the apex of lighting rod, under the action of the electric field of a thunderstorm cloud, to evaluate the efficiency of elements of lighting protection systems. Methodology. We have applied the mathematical simulation of electromagnetic field distribution on the top of metal rod by different forms. As a mathematical apparatus, we use the finite element method. We considered two forms of the rod section: round and square. The round (cylindrical) rod has a sharp apex. The square rod has a flat top. The experimental study investigates the features of corona discharge formation. A high-voltage test equipment is created an electric field. Experiments carried out using a configuration consisting a potential plate and vertical rod electrode on grounded plate. The electric field strength varied from 1 kVm- 1 to 100 kVm- 1. This range corresponds to the thunderstorm condition. Results. We have obtained a correlation between the corona current and the strength of the electric field for various shapes of the rod top. The results of experimental studies confirmed the correctness of the conclusions of theoretical estimates. We show that the time parameters of streamer current pulses vary by no more than 30 %, but a streamer charge increase to three time with increasing electric field strength. We proposed and applied a method for measuring the velocity of motion of a streamer in the discharge gap. As a result, it is established that the streamer speed is nonlinear in time. For a discharge gap of 1. 2 m, the speed varies from 1. 8 ∙ 104 m/s to 1. 1 ∙ 106 m/s. Originality. For the first time, we have carried out a complex of studies of corona discharge parameters from <b>lightning</b> <b>protector</b> rod to apply for the certification procedure of ESE terminals. Practical value. Based on the set of obtained results, it is obviously that the standard NF C 17 - 102 : 2011 will not be introduced as a national standard of Ukraine before full introduction of scientifically justified data will be include into the requirements of the standard...|$|E
