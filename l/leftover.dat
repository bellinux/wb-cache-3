5|$|These {{ideas can}} be {{illustrated}} by drawing objects in pairs. It {{is difficult to}} depict zero groups of two, or to emphasize the nonexistence of a <b>leftover</b> object, so it helps to draw other groupings and to compare them with zero. For example, {{in the group of}} five objects, there are two pairs. More importantly, there is a <b>leftover</b> object, so 5 is odd. In the group of four objects, there is no <b>leftover</b> object, so 4 is even. In the group of just one object, there are no pairs, and there is a <b>leftover</b> object, so 1 is odd. In the group of zero objects, there is no <b>leftover</b> object, so 0 is even.|$|E

40|$|Food waste {{results in}} {{nutritional}} losses, ecological damage, and environmental pollution. This survey is conducted in Beijing and aims {{to determine whether}} food waste can be reduced by food packing when <b>leftovers</b> are produced at the dining table and to identify factors that affect food packing behavior {{and the use of}} <b>leftovers.</b> Based on statistical and econometric analyses of the relationship between <b>leftovers</b> packing and possible factors, this study finds that the age, educational level, employment status, farming experience, environmental protection consciousness, food saving advertisement, families with old members, and reasons for dining out significantly influence the food packing behavior of the consumers. Moreover, the dining environment {{plays an important role in}} <b>leftovers</b> packing. People with intimate relationships, such as families, friends, classmates, or colleagues, are more willing to take <b>leftovers</b> home. Business partners do the opposite. Finally, almost all packed <b>leftovers</b> (91. 59 %) are eaten by people and animals. Therefore, packing <b>leftovers</b> is an excellent approach to reduce food waste...|$|R
50|$|Although {{originally}} {{released as}} a separate release, The <b>Leftovers</b> EP was later packaged together with Taste the Secret and released in 2004 as Combo Meal: Taste the Secret/The <b>Leftovers</b> EP on the Emperor Norton/Rykodisc record label.|$|R
5|$|Before her death, Aaliyah {{had planned}} to embark on the largest concert tour of her career to support the album. Her {{recording}} sessions for Aaliyah produced many <b>leftover</b> tracks that were posthumously archived by Blackground and mostly left unreleased because of internal conflicts and legal complications between the label, Aaliyah's family, and the producers. The compilation album I Care 4 U was released in 2002 and featured six previously unreleased songs from the sessions for Aaliyah.|$|E

5|$|Matangi {{is often}} {{associated}} with pollution, especially left-over or partially eaten food (Ucchishta or Ucçhishṭa, उच्छिष्ट) considered impure in Hinduism. She is often offered such polluted left-over food and is in one legend described to be born from it. Matangi is herself described as the <b>leftover</b> or residue, symbolizing the Divine Self that is left over after all things perish. As the patron of left-over food offerings, she embodies inauspiciousness and the forbidden transgression of social norms.|$|E

5000|$|The Flex-Able <b>Leftovers</b> album, {{released}} on November 10, 1998 on Sony Records, contains five bonus tracks and {{is quite different}} from the original Flex-Able <b>Leftovers</b> EP. Unlike Steve Vai's other albums, which are mostly instrumental, almost all copies of Flex-Able <b>Leftovers</b> feature a Parental Advisory label, as a result of the song [...] "Fuck Yourself" [...] containing multiple profanities and sexual references. Other differences from the original version include the recording of live drums on [...] "You didn't break it!" [...] (Original was drum machine) and the complete re-editing and mixing of the songs.|$|R
5|$|The {{album was}} {{completed}} on November 2013, and a bonus disc was also {{made for the}} album, containing the <b>leftover</b> material from the main album as well as songs from Ghost 2, the unreleased compilation of <b>leftover</b> tracks from Ghost. Originally in 2012, Townsend stated that this album will be the sixth and the last album in the Devin Townsend Project series, but he ultimately confirmed that Casualties of Cool is its own project. Townsend also started a crowdfunding campaign through PledgeMusic to support {{the release of the}} album. The funding quickly reached its goal, and all additional funds were put directly to Townsend's upcoming projects. Casualties of Cool was released on May 14, 2014. The album was re-issued worldwide on January 15, 2016 containing an additional DVD with live footage from the 2014 concert at the Union Chapel in London.|$|E
5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. The {{incoming}} material, food, enters {{the body and}} is concocted into blood; waste is excreted as urine, bile, and faeces, and the element fire is released as heat. Blood is made into flesh, the rest forming other earthy tissues such as bones, teeth, cartilages and sinews. <b>Leftover</b> blood is made into fat, whether soft suet or hard lard. Some fat {{from all around the}} body is made into semen.|$|E
5|$|Within the UK, {{the most}} common {{variation}} is to use lamb instead of mutton. Gloucester Squab pie did not require lamb and suggests any <b>leftover</b> meat could be used. Other ingredients can be included, for example Agatha Christie produced a variant which included hard-boiled eggs and another recipe took the concept of serving with clotted cream and adds cream to thicken.|$|E

5|$|Construction of both Have Blue demonstrators used <b>leftover</b> tools {{from the}} C-5 program. Final {{assembly}} of HB1001 was originally scheduled {{to end in}} August 1977, before being ground tested until mid-October. The secret roll-out was envisaged to occur on 23October, after which the aircraft would be dismantled and flown to the test area. On 1September, however, with HB1001 partially complete, Lockheed machinists went on a four-month strike. A group of managers instead took over the job of assembly, which was completed in six weeks, with ground tests beginning on 17October.|$|E
5|$|In 1942 Coastal Command's {{problems}} did not abate. Experienced {{crews were}} siphoned off to Malta, to undertake ASO against German and Italian shipping in the Mediterranean. Hudson, Blenheim and Beaufighter squadrons had shortfalls of 69, 28 and 20 aircrews by January 1942. The <b>leftover</b> crews, some 75 percent, were {{far off the}} 200 operational hours considered for a pilot to be experienced. Efficiency fell among squadrons. The mixing of experienced crews and the inexperienced damaged morale and accident rates increased.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the US Government Accountability Office said a {{shortage}} of lithium-7 critical to the operation of 65 out of 100 American nuclear reactors “places their ability to continue to provide electricity at some risk”. The problem stems from the decline of US nuclear infrastructure. The equipment needed to separate lithium-6 from lithium-7 is mostly a cold war <b>leftover.</b> The US shut down most of this machinery in 1963, when it had a huge surplus of separated lithium, mostly consumed during the twentieth century. The report {{said it would take}} five years and $10 million to $12 million to reestablish the ability to separate lithium-6 from lithium-7.|$|E

5|$|The RTV-A-2 Hiroc (high-altitude rocket) was the United States' {{first attempt}} at an {{intercontinental}} ballistic missile (ICBM). The project was initially under the name MX-774, however the project was canceled in 1947, and <b>leftover</b> funds were used to build and launch three missiles, which were renamed to RTV-A-2 Hiroc. The design included several innovations; the gimballed engine provided guidance control, the internal gas pressure was used to support the airframe and the nose cap was separable. All of these concepts were later used on the Atlas missile.|$|E
5|$|The floodwaters {{from the}} {{hurricane}} combined with raw sewage in many poor areas of southwestern Mexico, {{leading to a}} widespread threat for a spread of tropical diseases. As a result, government health workers opened vaccination centers in several cities along the Guerrero and Oaxaca coasts. Thousands were inoculated for typhoid fever and tetanus. Officials noted a potential threat for dengue and cholera {{as a result of}} the spoiled water. Health workers also stated mosquitos possessing malaria and dengue fever were likely to breed in large areas of <b>leftover</b> water. In Acapulco, about two days after the hurricane passed, the first day of sun in a week evaporated the areas of <b>leftover</b> water, spreading dust across the region with the deadly diseases. Residents were warned to boil their food and water for 30minutes due to the threat for contamination by the dust. At least twenty cases of cholera and at least six cases of dengue fever were reported. Most significantly, there were 14,630cases of malaria in 616villages in Oaxaca due to Pauline; this represented about 80% of the malaria cases in Mexico during 1998. Army soldiers distributed chlorine tablets to disinfect water pools and wheelbarrows to remove rotting mud and sewage from their damaged homes. Two C-130 Hercules planes and twenty helicopters airlifted food and water to smaller villages south of Acapulco that were stranded for nearly a week after the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|The {{trailing}} {{edge of the}} transmitter pulse was not perfectly sharp and caused the receiver signals to ring {{for a short time}} even if they were turned on after the pulse was ostensibly complete. This <b>leftover</b> signal caused a large permanent blip known as the transmitter break through which appeared at the short-range end of the tubes (left and bottom). A control known as the Oscillator Bias allowed the exact timing of the receiver's activation relative to the transmitter pulse to be adjusted, normally so the remains of the pulse were just visible.|$|E

5|$|There are {{types of}} planets {{that do not}} exist in the Solar System: super-Earths and mini-Neptunes, which could be rocky like Earth or a mixture of {{volatiles}} and gas like Neptune—a radius of 1.75 times that of Earth is a possible dividing line between the two types of planet. There are hot Jupiters that orbit very close to their star and may evaporate to become chthonian planets, which are the <b>leftover</b> cores. Another possible type of planet is carbon planets, which form in systems with a higher proportion of carbon than in the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|While {{the core}} was under construction, a {{corridor}} was left open {{leading into the}} shaft where the grave chamber was built separately and later covered by <b>leftover</b> stone blocks and debris. This construction strategy is clearly visible in later unfinished pyramids, in particular the Pyramid of Neferefre. This technique also reflects the older style from the 3rd Dynasty seemingly coming back into fashion after being temporarily abandoned by the builders of the five great pyramids at Dahshur and Giza during the 4th Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|As an adult, {{the house}} sparrow mostly feeds on {{the seeds of}} grains and weeds, but it is {{opportunistic}} and adaptable, and eats whatever foods are available. In towns and cities, it often scavenges for food in garbage containers and congregates in the outdoors of restaurants and other eating establishments to feed on <b>leftover</b> food and crumbs. It can perform complex tasks to obtain food, such as opening automatic doors to enter supermarkets, clinging to hotel walls to watch vacationers on their balconies, and nectar robbing kowhai flowers. In common with many other birds, the house sparrow requires grit to digest the harder items in its diet. Grit can be either stone, often grains of masonry, or the shells of eggs or snails; oblong and rough grains are preferred.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{addresses}} the cutting stock/leftover problem (CSLP), which {{differs from the}} ordinary cutting stock problem (CSP) by retaining stock <b>leftovers</b> that can be cut {{in the future to}} meet new demands. Therefore, <b>leftovers</b> are not considered waste in the current period. A new mathematical model for the CSLP is presented to capture a well-used strategy in the practice of cutting, which consists of partially cutting the objects in stock, and keeping the <b>leftovers</b> to be cut in the next periods. Computational experiments were made for the one-dimensional case, although other dimensions can be considered straightforward...|$|R
