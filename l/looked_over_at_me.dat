2500|$|Groove metal group Five Finger Death Punch had an {{incident}} when, during the song [...] "White Knuckles" [...] {{at a concert}} in Hartford Connecticut, a young man received a compound fracture on his ankle in a mosh pit. Ivan L. Moody, the band's lead singer, stopped the show, leaped into the crowd with Zoltan Bathory, the band's rhythm guitarist, and carried the injured fan onto the stage, where {{he was taken to}} the hospital. Moody has been quoted as saying: [...] "I looked him square in the face and asked him if he was okay, or if there was anything I could do for him. He <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> still in shock, and said 'You guys fucking rock!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{captain said}} nothing to Alan, but he <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with an ugly look. [...] "David," [...] said he, [...] "I'll mind this"; {{and the sound of}} his voice went through me with a jar.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{answered}} her friend, [...] "I {{would not be}} so wicked as to do that. All imitations of Nature seem to me a mock of God's handiwork, which no mortal brush can hope to equal. I shall never be so audacious, I hope. But a photograph is a pure reflex of Nature, and my caricatures, which are merely bits of harmless fun, furnish us now and then a spark of humor to make us laugh, and laughter is good for the soul. I often laugh at my own sketches, as you know. Sometimes I laugh at their whimsical conception, before ever I put pencil to paper. Lots of caricatures I make secretly, laughing over and then destroying them for fear they might be seen and hurt the feelings of their innocent subjects. Why, Mary Louise, I drew your doleful face only yesterday, and it was so funny I shrieked with glee. You heard me and <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a smile that made the caricature lie, so I promptly tore it up. It had served its purpose, you see." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 2014, when Beatty {{was asked}} whether Petrino had ever {{discussed}} giving him a job on his previous staffs, Beatty said, “I’m {{not going to say}} that I haven’t, but it hasn’t presented itself yet, so we’ll worry about that if the time comes.” Beatty {{went on to say that}} he has been grateful that Petrino has “always treated high school coaches with the utmost respect” and been willing to swap ideas with them. According to Beatty “There have been times I would go to (U of L’s) practice, and all of a sudden I’ll see something that I’ve done (at Trinity), and he’ll <b>look</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and say, ‘Hey, where did I get that?’” ...|$|R

5000|$|Sammy Cahn {{has said}} of the {{conception}} of the sixteen-bar song: [...] "This song was written one night in Palm Springs. When I sang the last line, Jule Styne <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and said, 'So. That's it.' I knew he felt we could have written on, but I felt I had said {{all there was to}} say, and if I had it to do over, I would stop right there again." ...|$|E
5000|$|From that point, Alphin's career took off, {{both as a}} {{songwriter}} {{and as part of}} the duo Big & Rich. Several years after the incident, he played some of his songs for McGraw. [...] "I'll never forget the day I played him the song," [...] Alphin said. [...] "We were at Blackbird Studio and Tim was making a new album. As we sat together in my truck, I played him a couple of the songs that I was recording. The second song I played was [...] "Last Dollar." [...] He <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and said, [...] "Are you gonna let me record that?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The book {{presents}} {{methods for}} discovering truths behind advertising, politics, media, family and social relationships. Kasten {{has described the}} genesis of the book as his experiences in a rural community [...] "It was 1970, and my family had recently moved from the San Francisco Bay Area to a town in the San Joaquin Valley…One evening I found myself sitting on a couch at my friend Earl's house…Walter Cronkite was finishing up a newscast with a bit of commentary. He spoke about the dangers of making up one's mind too quickly and labeling events before fully understanding them…His concluding phrase was something like, [...] "Let's not be too quick to use the label-making device." [...] Earl <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "Do you know what the crap he was talking about?" [...] Kasten has said the book is an attempt to answer that question.|$|E

[...] "Waves," [...] he said; [...] "and a remarkably neat schooner. I'd swear that was Bellows' voice. Hullo!" [...] He shouted suddenly {{at the top of his}} voice.|$|R
500|$|... "Life's a Glitch, Then You Die" [...] {{was written}} and {{conceived}} by Hauge. In DVD commentary for the episode, Hauge stated that, when writing the segment, {{he knew it}} would not age well. [...] "I was aware of it at the time, that it wouldn't last forever" [...] he said, [...] "But I wanted to capture that moment." [...] According to director Michels, the rocket which transported the [...] "best and brightest" [...] of the population was drawn to resemble a popsicle. The Simpsons staff had a lot of trouble finding a guest star for the second rocket, and the only person who agreed to participate was American actor Tom Arnold. In the episode, Arnold is depicted as an annoying, [...] "not-so-great" [...] celebrity. Although he was mostly in on the joke, Arnold did [...] "bust [...] chops" [...] a little bit when recording his lines. [...] "He would say a line and then they'd yell cut and he'd <b>look</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and take a shot at me" [...] Hauge said. Still, Hauge found Arnold's performance [...] "fantastic" [...] and Scully said that he was a [...] "good sport". The segment also features television personality Dick Clark as himself. A few months after the episode aired, Hauge discussed the segment with Clark in a Fox studio. According to Hauge, Clark said that the episode gave the [...] "biggest response" [...] he had ever gotten from anything he had ever done. [...] "After the career that he had in television for so long, just to give him a highlight was a highlight for me" [...] Hauge said in the episode's DVD commentary.|$|R

5000|$|... 'At {{what would}} turn out to be my last darshan of Maharaj-ji's {{physical}} body, I was petrified with fear about returning to the U.S. after so many years. I hadn't worn a pair of jeans or shoes for such a long time that I couldn't imagine what it would be like. I didn't want to ask Maharaj-ji what I should do in America, but all of a sudden I blurted out in anguish, 'Maharaj-ji! How can I serve you in America?''He looked at me with mock disgust and said, 'What is this? If you ask how you should serve then it is no longer service. Do what you want.' I couldn't believe my ears. How could doing what I wanted to do be of service to him? I didn't have that kind of faith. I just sat there, stunned. Then after a minute or so he <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> smiling sweetly, and asked, 'So, how will you serve me?''My mind was blank. It was time for me to leave for Delhi, to catch the plane back to the States. He was looking at me and laughing. I bent down and touched his feet for the last time and when I looked up, he was beaming at me, 'So, how will you serve me in America?' I felt like I was moving in a dream. I floated across the courtyard and bowed to him one more time from a distance. As I did, the words came to me, 'I will sing to you in America.''Soon afterwards, during the full moon in September, Neem Karoli Baba left his body. Now he had to be found within. The chanting, the meditation, the puja and all the wonderful time spent with Maharaj-ji turned out to be seeds that he himself had planted in my heart... seeds that would keep growing and blossom by his Grace.|$|E
60|$|What {{on earth}} was he,--man or beast? What {{did he want}} with me? I had no weapon, not even a stick. Flight would be madness. At any rate the Thing, {{whatever}} it was, lacked the courage to attack me. Setting my teeth hard, I walked straight towards him. I was anxious not to show the fear that seemed chilling my backbone. I pushed through a tangle of tall white-flowered bushes, and saw him twenty paces beyond, <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and hesitating. I advanced a step or two, looking steadfastly into his eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not of Jarndyce and Jarndyce?" [...] said Mr. Kenge, <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> {{his glasses}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and softly turning the case about and about {{as if he}} were petting something. [...] "Not of one of the {{greatest}} Chancery suits known? Not of Jarndyce and Jarndyce--the--a--in itself a monument of Chancery practice. In which (I would say) every difficulty, every contingency, every masterly fiction, every form of procedure known in that court, is represented over and over again? It is a cause that could not exist out of this free and great country. I should say that the aggregate of costs in Jarndyce and Jarndyce, Mrs. Rachael"--I was afraid he addressed himself to her because I appeared inattentive"--amounts at the present hour to from SIX-ty to SEVEN-ty THOUSAND POUNDS!" [...] said Mr. Kenge, leaning back in his chair.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose I wasn't on {{the landing}} a moment before he found out I was there. He turned on me sharply, and I saw {{the face of an}} {{immature}} young man, a weak nose, a scrubby little moustache, a feeble chin. So for an instant we stood--he <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and regarded one another. Then he seemed to remember his high calling. He turned round, drew himself up, projected his face, raised his arms, spread his hands in approved ghost fashion--came towards me. As he did so his little jaw dropped, and he emitted a faint, drawn-out 'Boo.' No, it wasn't--not a bit dreadful. I'd dined. I'd had a bottle of champagne, and being all alone, perhaps two or three--perhaps even four or five--whiskies, so I was as solid as rocks and no more frightened than if I'd been assailed by a frog. 'Boo!' I said. 'Nonsense. You don't belong to THIS place. What are you doing here?' ...|$|R
60|$|I can {{say nothing}} of what took place to right or left of me during the ruffle, for indeed {{there were so many}} {{pressing}} upon us, and the fight was so hot, that it was all that each of us could do to hold our own. The very number of our assailants was in our favour, by hampering their sword-arms. One burly miner cut fiercely <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with his scythe, but missing me he swung half round with the force of the blow, and I passed my sword through his body before he could recover himself. It {{was the first time that}} I had ever slain a man in anger, my dear children, and I shall never forget his white startled face as he <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder <b>at</b> <b>me</b> ere he fell. Another closed in with me before I could get my weapon disengaged, but I struck him out with my left hand, and then brought the flat of my sword upon his head, laying him senseless upon the pavement. God knows, I did not wish to take the lives of the misguided and ignorant zealots, but our own were at stake. A marshman, looking more like a shaggy wild beast than a human being, darted under my weapon and caught me round the knees, while another brought a flail down upon my head-piece, from which it glanced on to my shoulder. A third thrust <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a pike, and pricked me on the thigh, but I shore his weapon in two with one blow, and split his head with the next. The man with the flail gave back at sight of this, and a kick freed me from the unarmed ape-like creature at my feet, so that I found myself clear of my assailants, and none the worse for my encounter, save for a touch on the leg and some stiffness of the neck and shoulder.|$|R
5000|$|Originally {{scheduled}} {{to play in}} 24 countries over a ten-month period, the tour was curtailed after the Hurricane Festival performance in Scheeßel, Germany on 25 June 2004, {{as a result of}} Bowie being diagnosed with an acutely blocked artery that required an angioplasty procedure. In 2016, bassist Gail Ann Dorsey, who was on stage with Bowie, recalled what happened {{at the end of the}} tour: the second-to-last show, in Prague I remember we were playing the song [...] "Reality." [...] He was supposed to be singing at the very end of the song, and he wasn't. I was kind of watching him from behind. Everyone was soaking wet because it was really hot in there, but his shirt was just drenched. He was just soaking wet and holding the microphone out with his left hand straight out. And he was just standing there, posturing, but not singing. And I was thinking, [...] "Why is he not singing the last bit?"Then he <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> his shoulder <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and he was just white, pale, translucent almost. His eyes were wide and he was kind of gasping for air a little bit, having trouble catching his breath. And then I remember looking down at the audience, and I could see their expressions in the front row, looking up at him, had changed. They went from joy and dancing to looking kind of concerned. At that point, his bodyguard and helper guy saw the same thing. He ran onto the stage and took him off. ... We went back on and played a few more songs. He asked for a stool and he sat down. He just hated to cancel shows. There were some nights he was so sick he had a bucket on the side of the stage where he'd go between songs to puke, but he never wanted to cancel anything. And we didn't know he was having a heart attack until four or five days later.the last show, at the Hurricane Festival in Hamburg, Germany I remember walking down the stairs behind him after we finished. When he got to the bottom, he actually collapsed. He was so tired and so sick. They rushed him to the hospital and we sat and waited in Hamburg for a few days, and that was the end. The last show.|$|R
