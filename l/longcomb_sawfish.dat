50|$|The <b>longcomb</b> <b>sawfish</b> thrashes its rostrum from {{side-to-side}} {{to dislodge}} prey from the seabed and to stun fish. It {{is believed to}} feed on crustaceans, fish and squid. Little is known of its breeding habits but they are probably similar to the better studied largetooth sawfish (Pristis microdon) which produces a litter of live young after a gestation period of about five months and which gives birth in alternate years. It is known that <b>longcomb</b> <b>sawfish</b> pups measure about 60 to 108 cm at birth.|$|E
5000|$|The Dangerous Lagoon is an {{underwater}} tunnel with a moving side walk, {{which is the}} aquarium's largest tank. Some of the featured animals in this exhibit include sand tiger shark, sandbar shark, roughtail stingray, <b>longcomb</b> <b>sawfish,</b> green sea turtles.|$|E
50|$|The <b>longcomb</b> <b>sawfish</b> has a shark-like {{body and}} an elongated, blade-like snout {{known as a}} rostrum that has triangular, saw-like teeth on either side. This is the largest sawfish in the genus Pristis and can reach as much as 7.3 m long with a rostrum {{measuring}} 1.66 m. The dorsal (upper) surface is greenish-brown, the dorsal fins are yellowish-grey and the flanks are yellowish fading to a creamy-white colour on the ventral (under) surface. The rostral teeth are greyish-yellow and {{the central part of}} the rostrum is a darker shade. These teeth are slender and sharply pointed and usually number 23 to 37 pairs and this enables the <b>longcomb</b> <b>sawfish</b> to be distinguished from the otherwise similar knifetooth sawfish (Anoxypristis cuspidata) which has fewer rostral teeth, triangular in shape and blunt.|$|E
50|$|Apart from birds, {{threatened}} animals recorded {{from the}} bay and its surrounds include northern quolls, Mertens' water monitors, argus monitors, flatback and olive ridley turtles, dwarf and <b>longcomb</b> <b>sawfish,</b> and Dodd's azure butterflies. Feral pigs and water buffaloes are present. There is an ongoing program to monitor and remove saltwater crocodiles {{from the bay}}.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>longcomb</b> <b>sawfish</b> {{is listed}} by the IUCN as [...] "Critically Endangered" [...] in its Red List of Threatened Species. The {{population}} {{is believed to}} have declined by 80% over three generations, with the main threat being fishing. It is not usually the target species but easily gets entangled in fishing nets, and is retained as bycatch for its meat, fins and rostrum.|$|E
50|$|The <b>longcomb</b> <b>sawfish</b> {{or green}} sawfish (Pristis zijsron) is a sawfish {{of the family}} Pristidae, found in {{tropical}} waters of the Indo-West Pacific oceans, from the Red Sea and east Africa to Papua New Guinea, north to southern China, and south to New South Wales, Australia, between latitudes 21° N and 37° S. This critically endangered species can reach a length of up to 7.3 m.|$|E
50|$|The <b>longcomb</b> <b>sawfish</b> is {{native to}} the western Indo-Pacific. Its range extends from {{the east coast of}} Africa, the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea to India, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and {{northern}} Australia. It is also known from southern China, Vietnam, the Philippines and Papua New Guinea. It is found in shallow marine habitats down to a depth of about 5 m on sandy and muddy seabeds. It frequents estuaries and can enter rivers, an individual having once been found 150 mi inland in the Northern Territory of Australia.|$|E
