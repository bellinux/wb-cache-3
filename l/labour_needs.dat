25|$|The 'Betawi' (Orang Betawi, or 'people of Batavia') are the {{descendants}} of the people living in and around Batavia, and are recognised as an ethnic group from around the 18th–19th century. The Betawi people are mostly descended from various Southeast-Asian ethnic groups brought or attracted to Batavia to meet <b>labour</b> <b>needs,</b> and include people from different parts of Indonesia. Betawi people are a creole ethnic group that came from various parts of Indonesia and intermarried with Chinese, Arabs, and Europeans. Nowadays, most Betawi live in the fringe areas of Jakarta and there are hardly any Betawi-dominated areas in central Jakarta.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{its large}} {{population}} and {{in contrast to}} the other larger islands of Indonesia, Java is comparatively homogeneous in ethnic composition. Only two ethnic groups are native to the island—the Javanese and Sundanese. A third group is the Madurese, who inhabit the island of Madura off the north east coast of Java, and have immigrated to East Java in large numbers since the 18th century. The Javanese comprise about two-thirds of the island's population, while the Sundanese and Madurese account for 20% and 10% respectively. The fourth group is the Betawi people that speak a dialect of Malay, they are the descendants of the people living around Batavia from around the 17th century. Betawis are creole people, mostly descended from various Indonesian archipelago ethnic groups such as Malay, Sundanese, Javanese, Balinese, Minang, Bugis, Makassar, Ambonese, mixed with foreign ethnic groups such as Portuguese, Dutch, Arab, Chinese and Indian brought to or attracted to Batavia to meet <b>labour</b> <b>needs.</b> They have a culture and language distinct from the surrounding Sundanese and Javanese.|$|E

50|$|After {{the end of}} slavery, the West Indian sugar colonies {{tried the}} use of emancipated slaves, {{families}} from Ireland, Germany and Malta and Portuguese from Madeira. All these efforts failed to satisfy the <b>labour</b> <b>needs</b> of the colonies due to high mortality of the new arrivals and their reluctance to continue working {{at the end of}} their indenture. On 16 November 1844, the British Indian Government legalised emigration to Jamaica, Trinidad and Demerara (Guyana). The first ship, the Whitby, sailed from Port Calcutta for British Guiana on 13 January 1838, and arrived in Berbice on 5 May 1838. Transportation to the Caribbean stopped in 1848 due to problems in the sugar industry and resumed in Demerara and Trinidad in 1851 and Jamaica in 1860.|$|E

50|$|The island {{soon became}} a centre of {{production}} of tobacco. The planters grew prosperous. However, when the colony of Virginia began to dominate world tobacco production and profits started declining, the island switched to producing sugar cane, starting in 1640.

The slaves had very harsh living conditions, and thousands perished working the fields.|$|R
40|$|The labour stencil {{representing}} the expected cervimetric progress of normal labour {{was used in}} 741 consecutive spontaneous labours to identify high-risk <b>labours</b> which <b>needed</b> oxytocic stimulation.

According to the protocol used 36 % of primigravid and 13 % of multigravid <b>labours</b> <b>needed</b> acceleration. The remaining patients did not need any oxytocic interference during the first stage. This selection of patients is important to prevent a major obstetric advance being abused and discredited {{at a time when}} the profession and public are questioning the safety of active labour...|$|R
5000|$|Given {{the small}} amounts of {{saleable}} wheat and flour, and the rarity of cash, some have questioned how market oriented these early farmers were. Instead of depending on the market to meet their needs, many of these farmers depended on networks of shared resources and cooperative marketing. For example, rather than hire labour, they met their <b>labour</b> <b>needs</b> through [...] "work bees." [...] such farmers {{are said to be}} 'subsistence oriented' and not to respond to market cues; rather, they engage in a moral economy seeking 'subsistence insurance' and a 'just price'. The Children of Peace in the village of Hope (now Sharon) are a well documented example. They were the most prosperous agricultural community in Canada West by 1851.|$|E
5000|$|An October 2016 {{study of}} Canadian values by pollster Angus Reid [...] gave a {{conflicting}} picture: Although 68% {{of those polled}} said they wanted minorities {{to do more to}} fit into the mainstream, the same number also said they were nonetheless happy with how the immigrants they knew were integrating themselves into the community. Further, 79% of Canadians believe immigration policy should be based on the country's economic and <b>labour</b> <b>needs,</b> rather than on the needs of foreigners to escape crises in their home countries. In an analysis of the survey, Reid wrote that although Canadians' commitment to multiculturalism is not increasing, nevertheless their attitudes on immigration have no white-preference racism, and {{that the vast majority of}} newcomers feel that they are treated fairly and equally as [...] "Canadians".|$|E
5000|$|In 1988, Rhodes University {{professor}} Julian Cobbing advanced {{a controversial}} new hypothesis {{on the rise}} of the Zulu state; he contended the accounts of the Mfecane were a self-serving, constructed product of apartheid politicians and historians. According to Cobbing, apartheid historians had mischaracterised the Mfecane as a period of internally induced black-on-black destruction. Instead, Cobbing argued that the roots of the conflicts could be found exclusively in the <b>labour</b> <b>needs</b> of the Portuguese slave traders operating out of Delagoa Bay, in modern-day Mozambique, and of the British colonists in the Cape. The resulting pressures led to massive displacement, famine, and war in the interior, allowing later Afrikaner settlers to seize control of most land.

5000|$|This {{time it was}} the Portuguese {{who became}} the next racialized {{agricultural}} group in the Okanagan agricultural industry. However, the Portuguese were not nearly as discriminated against as the previous groups had been, largely due to their country of origin, which was less feared and more acceptable to the primarily white settler population in the Okanagan. From about the 1960s when Portuguese agricultural labour began to decline, migrant labour of young [...] "Québécois"French Canadians began to be prominent in the Okanagan agricultural sector. [...] However, this labour force too eventually waned, leaving yet another agricultural labour gap. This time labour is coming from much farther away, however, {{many of the same}} issues that characterized the Racialized labour of the 20th century remain in the migrant <b>labour</b> <b>needs</b> of fruit tree agriculture of the Okanagan.|$|E

40|$|Bibliography: pages 84 - 88. This study {{focuses on}} the nature and degree of {{articulation}} between Technikon education and <b>labour</b> market <b>needs</b> in South Africa. More specifically, it examines {{the effectiveness of the}} assessment of <b>labour</b> market <b>needs</b> as well as the influence of institutional needs and dynamics within the formal decision-making process which governs the introduction of new programmes. The research {{takes the form of a}} case study in which the researcher examines the decision-making process relating to the introduction of a particular programme - the ND: Education: Home Economics - at a particular Technikon. Data consisted of official records and documents as well as transcripts of interviews with key participants in the decision-making process. The data was used to reconstruct and analyse the decision-making process as implemented in the case of this programme. The study argues that, in this case, the formal, prescribed process which purported to assess <b>labour</b> market <b>needs</b> did not effectively engage with the actual dynamics of the market place. The mechanisms designed to assess <b>labour</b> market <b>needs</b> were largely symbolic and highly bureaucratised. In addition to being weak in design, assessment procedures were not stringently implemented. While the introduction of new programmes is explicitly justified on the grounds of <b>labour</b> market <b>needs,</b> the decision-making process was in this case, strongly - though implicitly and informally - influenced by institutional needs and dynamics within the Technikon itself. This study points to the weaknesses in the design and control of the official prescribed process which guides decisions regarding the introduction of all new programmes at South African Technikons. On a theoretical level, it also calls into question an assumption on which much literature pertaining to Technikon education is premised, that is, the assumption that there is a relatively smooth articulation between the supply of Technikon graduates and <b>labour</b> market <b>needs...</b>|$|R
