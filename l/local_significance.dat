5|$|In 2011, Petersen Rock Garden {{was named}} one of Oregon's Most Endangered Places by the Historic Preservation League of Oregon (now known as Restore Oregon). In 2012, {{accidental}} damage {{to one of the}} stone bridges by a contractor catalyzed an effort to document the garden using laser scanning and other technologies. The garden was closed temporarily in 2013 to undergo repair and review for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Petersen has been praised for his creative work, and the garden has received a positive reception for its uniqueness and <b>local</b> <b>significance.</b> Listing on the National Register was achieved on October 30, 2013.|$|E

25|$|Burebista's Dacian {{state was}} {{powerful}} enough to threaten Rome, and Caesar contemplated campaigning against the Dacians. Despite this, the formidable Dacian power under Burebista lasted only {{until his death in}} 44 BC. The subsequent division of Dacia continued for about a century until the reign of Scorilo. This was a period of only occasional attacks on the Roman Empire's border, with some <b>local</b> <b>significance.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Duchy and {{eventually}} Principality of Benevento in southern Italy developed a unique Christian rite in the 7th and 8th centuries. The Beneventan rite is {{more closely related}} to the liturgy of the Ambrosian rite than to the Roman rite. The Beneventan rite has not survived in its complete form, although most of the principal feasts and several feasts of <b>local</b> <b>significance</b> are extant. The Beneventan rite appears to have been less complete, less systematic, and more liturgically flexible than the Roman rite.|$|E

25|$|The Union House, {{along with}} being the first brick house built in Orangeville, is the only example of Gothic Revival {{architecture}} found in the village. It is important locally because it was constructed by the village founder, John Bower. The house {{is also a good}} example of the crossover from Greek to Gothic Revival and blends elements from both style. The house's <b>local</b> <b>significance,</b> combined with its architectural importance qualified it for listing on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on May 11, 2000.|$|E
25|$|At the preface, I H Qureshi {{addresses}} the common {{question as to}} whether it is possible to disentangle the history of Pakistan from the history of India. He maintains that although for certain periods Pakistan shares common history with modern day India, there are periods of regional history with <b>local</b> <b>significance</b> that were actually dominated by the events outside the South Asia, especially in Central Asia and Iranian plateau. There have also been times when the region actually became arbiter of the South Asia's historical destiny.|$|E
25|$|The Augustów Canal remained, after completion, an inland {{waterway}} of <b>local</b> <b>significance</b> {{that was used}} for commercial shipping and to transport wood {{to and from the}} Vistula River and Neman River. The canal was used to transport the flour, salt, grain, chalk, gypsum, etc. In Augustów a large port was built in addition to a number of tow paths for horses to pull barges upstream. The canal was designed for the passage of vessels up to 40 m long, up to 5 m in width and capable of carrying up to 10 tons of cargo.|$|E

25|$|Central House is commercially {{significant}} for {{its role as}} meeting place for citizens of Orangeville and travelers alike. It provided lodging and dining facilities for more than 60 years, and its construction was {{with the intention of}} being the central commercial building in Orangeville. The building remains one of the oldest surviving buildings in Orangeville and is the village's only hotel in its history. It is also the only three-story building within the Orangeville central business district. For its <b>local</b> <b>significance</b> in the area of architecture the building was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on May 20, 1999.|$|E
25|$|The Franklin Hotel was {{nominated}} for the National Register of Historic Places due to its <b>local</b> <b>significance</b> {{in the history of}} Kent under criteria A and B. The building is first significant in the area of Commerce and Community Planning and Development of Criterion A because of the mobilization {{on the part of the}} Kent business community it is the result of. It is also significant under the area of Social History in Criterion B for its association with key government and business figures in the history of Kent and the early development of Kent State University.|$|E
25|$|On 4 July 2012 {{both of the}} CERN {{experiments}} {{announced they}} had independently made the same discovery: CMS of a previously unknown boson with mass 125.3 ± 0.6 GeV/c2 and ATLAS of a boson with mass 126.0±0.6GeV/c2. Using the combined analysis of two interaction types (known as 'channels'), both experiments independently reached a <b>local</b> <b>significance</b> of 5 sigma — implying that the probability of getting at least as strong a result by chance alone is less than 1 in 3 million. When additional channels were taken into account, the CMS significance was reduced to 4.9 sigma.|$|E

25|$|The Malvern Roller Mill {{was added}} to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on August 4, 1995 because of its <b>local</b> <b>significance</b> in the areas of {{industry}} and commerce. The building operated as a grinding mill for farmers and the nearby community of Malvern from its construction until it closed in 1942. It is the only known mill in northwestern Illinois that retains all of its equipment for an all roller and no grindstone process. If the millrace and turbines are clean the mill could operate as it did when it was in business. The Malvern Roller Mill provides a glimpse at the complexity of late 19th century milling operations.|$|E
25|$|The age and stratigraphic {{equivalents}} of the Hoy sandstone sequence are {{a matter}} of continuing debate. Traditionally {{the presence of an}} unconformity {{at the base of the}} lavas beneath these sandstones on southwestern Hoy has been interpreted to mark a major time break. More recent studies have suggested that this unconformity is of only <b>local</b> <b>significance</b> as a hiatus of this age has not been recognised elsewhere in the Orcadian Basin sequence. It has been proposed that the Hoy sandstones are the lateral equivalents of the Eday Group, the thickness and associated facies changes being caused by active extensional faulting during deposition. The presence of lavas within the Eday Flagstone Formation has been used to lend support to this idea, but differences in the chemistry between these lavas and those on Hoy mean that such a correlation remains uncertain.|$|E

Moon Publications {{described it as a}} [...] "full-fledged rock fantasy" [...] and a [...] "rock garden to end all rock gardens", with a [...] "funky" [...] museum.

For the HL-LHC we find limits on BR(h→μτ) and BR(h→ e τ) ≲O(0. 5) % and on BR(h → e μ) ≲O(0. 02) %. For an ILC with center-of-mass energy of 1 TeV we expectBR(h → e τ) and BR(h→μτ) to be measurable down toO(0. 2) %...|$|R
