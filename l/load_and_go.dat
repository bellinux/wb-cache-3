40|$|Background: An {{effective}} {{management of the}} healthcare's organization on one disaster site is considered as a condition in order to decrease damages and suffering at them as been hit of an accident. In KAMEDO-reports is described true accidents, how among other thing organizational parts been implemented and evaluations of which importance different decisions had. Aim: The aim {{of the study was}} to examine KAMEDO-reports concerning prehospital medical management on disaster sites. Method: Eight KAMEDO-reports was examined with focus on organization and management. Results: Four areas in which all could be influenced by the healthcare personnel in leading position was described: Management and Co-operation, <b>Load</b> <b>and</b> <b>Go</b> - Stay and Play, Priority and Triage. In most cases, the personnel that arrived in the first ambulance took the initial management responsibility. In seven of eight reports the principle of <b>Load</b> <b>and</b> <b>Go</b> was used which mainly depended on good transport possibilities and short distances to hospitals. A tendency could be discerned that the use of priority markings and damage cards was poorly used. About triage to the hospitals became correct in order to avoid overload depended in big part on how well the management functioned on the disaster site. Conclusion: It is important that personnel that is surely familiar with working on a disaster site also remains in conductive position in case of a big accident...|$|E

40|$|First {{we discuss}} some early work of Ulrike Feudel on {{structure}} formation in nonlinear reactions including ions and {{the efficiency of}} the conversion of chemical into electrical energy. Then we give some survey about energy conversion from chemical to higher forms of energy like mechanical, electrical and ecological energy. We consider examples of energy conversion in several natural processes and in some devices like fuel cells. Further, as an example, we study analytically the dynamics and efficiency of a simple "active circuit" converting chemical into electrical energy and driving currents which is roughly modeling fuel cells. Finally we investigate an analogous ecological system of Lotka - Volterra type consisting of an "active species" consuming some passive "chemical food". We show analytically for both these models that the efficiency increases with the load, reaches values higher then 50 percent in a narrow regime of optimal <b>load</b> <b>and</b> <b>goes</b> beyond some maximal load abrupt to zero.

60|$|One {{sees that}} music has {{its place in}} thought, but hardly as yet in language. When the Muse arrives, we {{wait for her to}} remould language, and impart to it her own rhythm.

Homer and Shakespeare and Milton and Marvell and Wordsworth are but the rustling of leaves and crackling of twigs in the forest, and there is not yet the sound of any bird. The Muse has never lifted up her voice to sing. Most of all, satire will not be sung. A Juvenal or Persius do not marry music to their verse, but are measured fault-finders at best; stand but just outside the faults they condemn, and so are concerned rather about the monster which they have escaped, than the fair prospect before them. Let them live on an age, and they will have travelled out of his shadow and reach, and found other objects to ponder.|$|R

5000|$|The first option, making <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> stores <b>go</b> in-order, avoids RAW dependences {{because there}} is no {{possibility}} of a load executing before its producer store and obtaining incorrect data. Another possibility is to effectively break <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> stores into two operations: address generation and cache access. With these two separate but linked operations, the CPU can allow <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> stores to access the memory system only once all previous <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> stores have had their address generated and buffered in the LSQ. After address generation, there are no longer any ambiguous dependencies since all addresses are known, <b>and</b> so dependent <b>loads</b> will not be executed until their corresponding stores complete. This scheme still allows for some [...] "out-of-orderness"—the address generation operations for any in-flight <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> stores can execute out-of-order, and once addresses have been generated, the cache accesses for each load or store can happen in any order that respects the (now known) true dependences.|$|R

50|$|Memory {{barriers}} are necessary because most modern CPUs employ performance optimizations {{that can result}} in out-of-order execution. This reordering of memory operations (<b>loads</b> <b>and</b> stores) normally <b>goes</b> unnoticed within a single thread of execution, but can cause unpredictable behaviour in concurrent programs and device drivers unless carefully controlled.

Quite certain that no one was left on the sinking steamer, all I had to do was to row after the other boats, and to overtake them as soon as possible. I thought it would not take me very long to do this, but after rowing for half an hour, Mrs. Aleshine remarked that the lights seemed as far off, if not farther, than when we first started after them. Turning, I saw that this was the case, and was greatly surprised. With only two passengers I ought soon to have come up with those heavily laden boats. But after I had thought over it a little, I considered that as each of them was probably pulled by half a dozen stout sailors, it was not so very strange that they should make as good or better headway than I did.|$|R
