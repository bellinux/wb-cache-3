50|$|The mean of any {{function}} {{refers to}} the average value. In the case of mean piston speed, taken in a narrow mathematical sense, it is zero because half {{of the time the}} piston is moving up and half of the time the piston is moving down; this is not useful. The way the term is usually used is to describe the distance traveled by the piston per unit of time, taking distance positive in both up and down senses. It is related to the rate that friction work is done on the cylinder walls, and thus the rate that heat generated there.This is sort of a non-puzzle. It represents a specification to be designed to rather than as a result of. I'm not an ME but I have built many engines of various types over the years and the mean piston velocity {{is a function of the}} revolutions per minute, that is, the piston at a specific rpm is going to be the same at the peak of the graph as it is at the trough, that is at 286.071 degrees on the crankshaft if the rpm is held consistent. At 0 and 180 degrees, the piston velocity is zero.Piston velocity is a test of the strength of the piston and connecting rod subassembly. The alloy used to make the piston itself is what determines the maximum velocity that the piston can reach before friction coefficients, heat levels and reciprocating stress overcome the maximum levels that the piston can sustain before it begins to fail structurally. As the alloy tends to be fairly consistent across most manufacturers, the maximum velocity of the piston at a given rpm is determined by the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stroke,</b> that is, the radius of the journal of the crankshaft.The most common engine types in production are built to square, or below square. That is, a square engine has the same diameter of cylinder bore as the total <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stroke</b> from 0 to 180 degrees, whereas in an undersquare engine, the total <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stroke</b> is less than the diameter of the bore. The latter is mostly used in higher performance engines where the torque curve approaches the peak of the maximum piston velocity. Generally in this type of engine, the volume of the cylinder can be artificially enhanced with turbochargers or superchargers, increasing the amount of fuel/air available for combustion.An example is found in Formula 1 racing engines, where the cylinder diameter is substantially greater than the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stroke,</b> resulting in higher available rpm but necessitating greater requirements of the strengths of connecting rods and pistons and higher temperature tolerances for bearings. The cylinder diameter in these engines are fairly small (under 45 mm) and the stroke is less than that, depending on the torque curve and maximum available rpm as designed by the builder. Peak torque is reached at higher rpm and is spread over a wider range of rpm. The specifications of these are known factors and can be designed to.Torque is a function <b>of</b> the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stroke,</b> the shorter the stroke, the less available torque at lower rpm, but the piston velocity can be taken to much greater speeds, meaning higher engine rpm. These types of engines are much more delicate and require a much higher level of precision in the moving parts than square or oversquare engines. Up until the early 1960s, the focus by designers was on torque rather than piston velocity, probably due to material considerations and machining technologies. As materials have improved, engine rpm has increased.|$|R

The objective {{of this paper is to}} compare the impact of the referral to the Project versus being discharged home, in the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> stay <b>of</b> <b>stroke</b> patients between 2010 and 2011. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study of patients admitted to the Neurology Infirmary A and <b>Stroke</b> Unit <b>of</b> Coimbra's University Hospital, in 2010 and 2011. The cases analyzed were 1 209, featuring demographic data, <b>length</b> <b>of</b> stay, Rankin Score (mRS) and destination after discharge. The data was analyzed comparing the two years concerning the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> stay <b>of</b> <b>stroke</b> patients referred to the Project and those discharged home, given the their Rankin Score. RESULTS: In 2011, the number patients referred to the National Post Hospital Care Project was higher, 23. 5 % compared to 21. 4 %. The <b>length</b> <b>of</b> stay for the same Rankin Score of the patients referred to National Post Hospital Care Project, remained higher than those discharged home: for a Rankin Score of 1 : 11, versus 26 days for the Project; Rankin Score 2 : 13, versus 29 days for the project; Rankin Score 3 : 13, versus 23 days for the Project; Rankin Score 4 : 17, to 33 days for the Project, Rankin Score 5 : 27, versus 39 days to the Project. After comparison between the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> stay of patient discharged of and those referred to the National Post Hospital Care Project, it was estimated that the referral represented an hospitalization excess of 1 718 days in 2010 and 1 198 days in 2011...|$|R

In this study, conversion of mechanical vibration into electricity using piezoelectric vibration-to-electricity converter is undertaken with a focus to quantify the amount of power that can be generated and identify electronic devices that can fully utilize this power.

40|$|Spasticity, {{contracture}} {{and muscle}} weakness often occur together poststroke and cause considerable motor impairments to stroke survivors. The underlying changes in contractile properties of muscle fascicles {{are still not}} clear. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the contractile property changes of the medial gastrocnemius muscle fascicles poststroke. Ten stroke survivors and ten healthy subjects participated in the study. The medial gastrocnemius fascicular length was measured at various combinations of ankle and knee positions using ultrasonography, with the muscle activated selectively using electrical stimulation. The stimulation intensity was kept constant across different ankle and knee positions to establish the active force-length relationship of the muscle fascicles. It was found that stroke survivors showed a shift of the force-length curve with a significantly shorter optimal fascicle length (33. 2 ± 3. 2 mm) compared with that of healthy controls (47. 4 ± 2. 7 mm) with P < 0. 001. Furthermore, the width span of the fascicular force-length curve of stroke survivors was significantly narrower with steeper slopes than that of controls (P ≤ 0. 001), suggesting reduced number of sarcomeres along the fascicles and/or reduced sarcomere length poststroke. Regression analysis showed that the medial gastrocnemius fascicular <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>stroke</b> survivors varied significantly less with ankle and knee flexions (P ≤ 0. 001) than that of controls, suggesting shorter and stiffer muscle fascicles poststroke, which might be attributed to muscle architectural adaptation. This study showed that there are considerable changes in the contractile properties of muscle fascicles poststroke, which may contribute directly to the joint-level changes of decreased range of motion, increased stiffness, muscle weakness, and impaired motor functions in stroke survivors...|$|E
40|$|Determining {{similarity}} of two point sequences (strokes) {{is a fundamental}} task in gestural interfaces. Because the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> each <b>stroke</b> is arbitrary, mapping to a fixed-dimension feature space is often done to allow for direct comparison.

The sequence of these angles can be mapped to a k-dimensional feature space by quantizing the unit circle into k ranges, and taking a normalized count of the number <b>of</b> <b>stroke</b> angles in each range. The Euclidean distance between strokes in this feature space gives a measure <b>of</b> <b>stroke</b> similarity.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} effects on balance and walking of three models of stroke rehabilitation: early {{supported}} discharge with rehabilitation in a day unit or at home, and traditional uncoordinated treatment (control). Design: Group comparison study within a randomised controlled trial. Setting: Hospital stroke unit and primary healthcare. Participants: Inclusion criteria: a score of 2 – 26 on National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, assessed with Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke (PASS), and discharge directly {{home from the hospital}} stroke unit. Interventions: Two intervention groups were given early supported discharge with treatment in either a day unit or the patient’s own home. The controls were offered traditional, uncoordinated treatment. Outcome measures: Primary: PASS. Secondary: Trunk Impairment Scale—modified Norwegian version; timed Up-and-Go; 5 m timed walk; self-reports on problems with walking, balance, ADL, physical activity, pain and tiredness. The patients were tested before randomisation and 3 months after inclusion. Results: From a total of 306 randomised patients, 167 were tested with PASS at baseline and discharged directly home. 105 were retested at 3 months: mean age 69 years, 63 men, 27 patients in day unit rehabilitation, 43 in home rehabilitation and 35 in a control group. There were no group differences, either at baseline for demographic and test data or for <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>stroke</b> unit stay.
