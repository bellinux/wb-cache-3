500|$|Word spaces, {{preceding}} or following punctuation, {{should be}} optically adjusted {{to appear to}} be of the same value as a standard word space. [...] If a standard word space is inserted after a full point or a comma, then, optically, this produces a space of up to 50% wider than that of other word spaces within a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>type.</b> [...] This is because these punctuation marks carry space above them, which, when added to the adjacent standard word spaces, combines to create a visually larger space. [...] Some argue that the [...] "additional" [...] space after a comma and full point serves as a [...] "pause signal" [...] for the reader. [...] But this is unnecessary (and visually disruptive) since the pause signal is provided by the punctuation mark itself.|$|E
50|$|Proofing typeset galleys is an {{important}} step after developing the photo paper. Corrections can be made by typesetting a word or <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>type</b> and by waxing the back of the galleys, and corrections can be cut out with a razor blade and pasted on top of any mistakes.|$|E
50|$|A {{subscript}} or superscript is {{a character}} (number, letter or symbol) that is (respectively) set slightly below or above the normal <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>type.</b> It is usually smaller {{than the rest of}} the text. Subscripts appear at or below the baseline, while superscripts are above. Subscripts and superscripts are perhaps most often used in formulas, mathematical expressions, and specifications of chemical compounds and isotopes, but have many other uses as well.|$|E
5000|$|In typography, leading ( [...] ) {{refers to}} the {{distance}} between the baselines <b>of</b> successive <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>type.</b> The term originated in the days of hand-typesetting, when thin strips of lead were inserted into the forms to increase the vertical distance between <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>type.</b> The term is still used in modern page-layout software such as QuarkXPress and Adobe InDesign.|$|R
5000|$|The word {{comes from}} lead strips that were put between set <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> lead <b>type,</b> hence the {{pronunciation}} [...] "ledding" [...] and not [...] "leeding". When type was set by hand in printing presses, slugs, or strips of lead of appropriate thicknesses were inserted between the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>type</b> to add vertical space, improving legibility.|$|R
50|$|In {{typesetting}} by hand compositing, a sort or type {{is a piece}} <b>of</b> <b>type</b> {{representing a}} particular letter or symbol, cast from a matrix mould and assembled with other sorts bearing additional letters into <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>type</b> {{to make up a}} form from which a page is printed.|$|R
50|$|In 1998 {{the company}} collaborated with Cirrus Design (now called Cirrus Aircraft) {{to develop the}} first {{recovery}} parachute system to be used on a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>type</b> certified aircraft, the Cirrus SR20, followed by the Cirrus SR22 in 2001. They named the design the Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS). In 2002 BRS received a supplemental type certificate to install their parachute system in the Cessna 172, followed by the Cessna 182 in 2004 and the Symphony SA-160 in 2006.|$|E
5000|$|An agate (US) or ruby (UK) is {{a unit of}} {{typographical}} measure. It is 5.5 typographical points, {{or about}} [...] inch (1.81 mm). It can refer to either {{the height of a}} <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>type</b> or to a font that is 5.5 points. An agate font is commonly used to display statistical data or legal notices in newspapers. It is considered to be the smallest point size that can be printed on newsprint and remain legible.|$|E
5000|$|Compartments {{also held}} spacers, which are blocks of blank type used to {{separate}} words and {{fill out a}} <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>type,</b> such as em and en quads (quadrats, or spaces. A quadrat is a block of type whose face {{is lower than the}} printing letters so that it does not itself print.). An em space was the width of a capital letter [...] "M" [...] - as wide as it was high - while an en space referred to a space half the width of its height (usually the dimensions for a capital [...] "N").|$|E
5000|$|In the 1880s-90s, [...] "hot lead" [...] {{typesetting}} was invented, {{in which}} type was cast {{as it was}} set, either piece by piece (as in the Monotype technology) or in entire <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>type</b> at one time (as in the Linotype technology).|$|R

5000|$|Wayne's line of truck-based {{ambulances}} ("Sentinel" [...] Suburbans starting for the 1968 model year, [...] "Vanguard" [...] Chevrolet vans for 1971, and [...] "Medicruiser" [...] Dodge vans for 1973) {{were built}} in the Blytheville facility. The Sentinel Suburbans received a headroom increase for 1971, but were only built through the 1972 model year. After that, the Sentinel brand name was used on Wayne's <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>Type</b> I (pickup chassis) modular ambulances. Body shells were produced at the Richmond, Indiana bus plant for Care-O-Van ambulance units, based upon cutaway chassis and Wayne Busette body.|$|E
5000|$|The {{label of}} the ration carton was printed across {{the lid of}} the {{rectangular}} box in three rows. The first row always read [...] "MEAL, COMBAT, INDIVIDUAL". The second row indicated the name of the meat unit in bold capital block letters (e.g., [...] "TURKEY LOAF") and the third row indicated the [...] "B"-unit number (either B-1, B-2 or B-3 Unit) in bold capital block letters. Sometimes there was a smaller fourth <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>type</b> at the very bottom of the cover that either indicated the contractor who made the ration or the manufacturer that made the cardboard box itself.|$|E
5000|$|Another problem Mergenthaler solved was in {{justifying}} the type, giving flush margins {{on the left}} and right. Hand compositors did this by using spaces of different widths in a line, to ensure that the lines all ended at the same point. Mergenthaler adapted the [...] "space band" [...] (patented by J. W. Schuckers), a device consisting of two wedges of metal connected loosely. When a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>type</b> was being justified, all the space band wedges would be pushed up in two passes to spread the line out to the full measure being cast. The space bands were stored for reuse in a different location from the matrices.|$|E

5000|$|Ottmar Mergenthaler (May 11, 1854 [...] - [...] October 28, 1899) was a German-born {{inventor}} who {{has been}} called a second Gutenberg, as Mergenthaler invented the linotype machine, the first device that could easily and quickly set complete <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>type</b> for use in printing presses. This machine revolutionized the art of printing.|$|R
50|$|Steam-powered {{printing}} presses became {{popular in the}} early 19th century. These machines could print 1,100 sheets per hour, but workers could only set 2,000 letters per hour. Monotype and linotype typesetting machines were introduced in the late 19th century. They could set more than 6,000 letters per hour and an entire <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>type</b> at once. There have been numerous improvements in the printing press. As well, the conditions for {{freedom of the press}} have been improved through the gradual relaxation of restrictive censorship laws. See also intellectual property, public domain, copyright. In mid-20th century, European book production had risen to over 200,000 titles per year.|$|E
5000|$|The Monotype machine {{worked by}} casting letters from [...] "hot metal" [...] (molten metal) as pieces of type. Thus {{spelling}} mistakes could be corrected by adding or removing individual letters. This was particularly useful for [...] "quality" [...] printing - such as books. In contrast, the Linotype machine formed a complete <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>type</b> in one bar. Editing these required replacing an entire line (and if the replacement ran onto another line, {{the rest of}} the paragraph). But Linotype slugs were easier to handle if moving a complete section of text around a page. This was more useful for [...] "quick" [...] printing - such as newspapers.|$|E

50|$|The {{invention}} {{of a machine}} to replace the labor-intensive task of setting type by hand was one that many inventors had tackled during the 19th Century. The difficulty was not in creating the text, but in returning the characters to a proper position for future use. Mergenthaler solved this problem by placing type molds {{on the sides of}} specially keyed matrices. The matrices would be lined up and hot lead alloy forced to fill the matrices, creating the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>type.</b> Then the matrices would progress through the machine, where a special keying system {{on one end of the}} matrix, unique for each character, would allow the matrix to drop only into the correct storage slot, ready for future use.|$|E
5000|$|The primary {{functional}} {{differences between}} a Ludlow Typograph and a Linotype {{is that the}} latter uses a keyboard to compose each <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>type,</b> whereas Ludlow uses hand-set mats, and that an ordinary Linotype was limited to faces smaller than twenty-four point, whereas Ludlow made whole alphabets up to 96 point and figures as large as 240 point. [...] The machine is much simpler and takes up less floor space, and the initial investment in the machine and mats is more affordable for a small print shop than a Linotype, primarily used by larger printers and formerly in newspapers. (Neither the Ludlow Typograph nor the Linotype is currently made; however, both machines can still be serviced, and parts and mats are readily available.) ...|$|E
