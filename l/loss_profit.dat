40|$|Data mining is the {{technique}} to find hidden patterns {{from a very}} large volume of historical data. Association rule {{is a type of}} data mining that correlates one set of items or events with another set of items or events. Another data mining strategy is clustering technique. This technique is used to create partitions so that all members of each set are similar according to a specified set of metrics. Both the association rule mining and clustering helps in more effective individual and group decision making for optimal inventory control. Owing to the above facts, association rules are mined from each cluster to find frequent items and then <b>loss</b> <b>profit</b> is calculated for each frequent item. Initially, the clustering algorithm is used to partition the transactional database into different clusters. Apriori, a classic data mining algorithm is utilized for mining association rules from each cluster to find frequent items. Later the <b>loss</b> <b>profit</b> is calculated for each frequent item. The obtained <b>loss</b> <b>profit</b> is used to rank frequent items in each cluster. Thus, the ranking of frequent items in each cluster using the proposed approach greatly facilitate optimal inventory control. An example is illustrated to validate the results...|$|E
40|$|We {{document}} {{a failure}} of the market to price the implications of a current <b>loss</b> (<b>profit)</b> for a future <b>loss</b> (<b>profit).</b> In a 120 -day window following the quarterly earnings announcement date, a portfolio of firms with extreme losses (profits) exhibits a - 6. 58 percent (3. 55 percent) abnormal return. These patterns in stock returns translate into an annualized return of approximately 21 percent on a hedge portfolio that takes a long position in an extreme profit firm quintile and a short position in an extreme loss firm quintile. The results also demonstrate that this loss/profit anomaly is incremental to, and more pronounced than previously documented accounting-related anomalies. In an effort to explain this finding, we show that this mispricing is related to differences between conditional and unconditional probabilities of losses/profits, as if stock prices do not fully reflect conditional probabilities in a timely fashion. A battery of sensitivity tests shows that this loss/profit anomaly is robust to alternative risk adjustments, distress risk, short sales constraints, transaction costs, and sample periods. ...|$|E

For this purpose, a PBUC model has been developed and utilized, using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). Simulations are {{used to determine the}} relationship between the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of a certain price forecast and the <b>loss</b> of <b>profit,</b> for four different types of power plants.

A classic thermal power plant (coal fired) and cascade hydro unit are less affected by incorrect forecasts, with only 2. 4 % and 2. 0 % <b>profit</b> <b>loss,</b> respectively, at the same price forecast MAPE.

However, many variables especially indirect cost in cost estimation is subject to uncertainty.

We study its efficiency under demand uncertainty: we solve for equilibrium and optimum as benchmarks, and evaluate the efficiency of possible regulatory policies for private road operators. We obtain analytic solutions for simple networks and numerical simulation results for more complex ones. For two serial links and two parallel links, self-financing still holds in expected terms for the first-best case, even though the capacity is higher than the capacity for the deterministic demand equal to the expected value. When forced to apply the second-best optimal pricing, the private supplier makes an expected <b>loss</b> (<b>profit)</b> if there is an untolled substitute (complement) in the network. In contrast to the deterministic counterpart of the problem we study, regulation by competitiv e auction cannot replicate the second-best zero-profit result.
