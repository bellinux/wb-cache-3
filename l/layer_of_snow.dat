5|$|Icings â€“ Roofs {{must also}} be {{designed}} to avoid ice dams, which result from meltwater running under the snow {{on the roof and}} freezing at the eave. Ice dams on roofs form when accumulated snow on a sloping roof melts and flows down the roof, under the insulating blanket of snow, until it reaches below freezing temperature air, typically at the eaves. When the meltwater reaches the freezing air, ice accumulates, forming a dam, and snow that melts later cannot drain properly through the dam. Ice dams may result in damaged building materials or in damage or injury when the ice dam falls off or from attempts to remove ice dams. The melting results from heat passing through the roof under the highly insulating <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} locations {{featured in the}} Kanon story, though the location names are seldom mentioned explicitly in Key's works. The events of the story occur during winter, and since it often snows periodically {{over the course of}} the entire story, the city is always presented covered in a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow.</b> The shopping district is featured throughout the story when the characters go into town, and especially whenever Ayu appears in the early story. The high school where Yuichi and the other main characters attend, including the school grounds, is shown predominantly in Shiori's and Mai's stories, and is otherwise a general setting where Yuichi interacts with other characters.|$|E

25|$|The {{location}} of the incident {{did not have any}} obvious signs of an avalanche having taken place. An avalanche would have left certain patterns and debris distributed over a wide area. The bodies found within ten days of the event were covered with a very shallow <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> and, had there been an avalanche of sufficient strength to sweep away the second party, these bodies would have been swept away as well; this would have caused more serious and different injuries in the process and would have damaged the tree line.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the film}} is set in Washington, D.C., many {{interior}} scenes were shot {{in various parts of}} New York City. The MacNeil residence interiors were filmed at CECO Studios in Manhattan. The bedroom set had to be refrigerated to capture the authentic icy breath of the actors in the exorcism scenes. The temperature was brought so low that a thin <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> fell onto the set one morning. Blair, who was only in a thin nightgown, says to this day she cannot stand being cold. Exteriors of the MacNeill house were filmed at 36th and Prospect in Washington, using a family home and a false wall to convey the home's thrust toward the steps.|$|E

25|$|Cape May had {{reported}} nearly 15inches <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> {{after the storm}} had moved out to sea.

The match was played at the Kennington Oval, London in atrocious weather conditions with the team captains agreeing to play only 30 minutes in each half. The match report in The Times said [...] "In {{spite of the fact that}} a thick <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> covered Kennington-oval on Saturday, the match between England and Wales, announced for that day, was played." [...] England scored twice in the first half, with Davies scoring the Wales reply in the 47th minute; Davies, [...] "with his usual brilliant dash landed the first goal for Wales, amidst tremendous cheering". According to Philip Gibbons, [...] "England were surprised by the level of skill shown by the Welsh team." ...|$|E
60|$|To {{keep out}} the cold, Dick crawled {{to the top of}} the opening and bound in the cedar limbs closer than ever. He also got some brush-wood and some vines, and on these placed a thick <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow.</b>|$|E

50|$|So, {{according}} to their model, if the polar regions had a subsurface lake perhaps formed originally through friction as a subglacial lake at times of favourable axial tilt, then supplied by accumulating <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> on top as the ice sheets thickened, they suggest that it could still be there. If so, it could be occupied by similar lifeforms to those that could survive in Lake Vostok.|$|R
50|$|Hope {{came for}} the actualization of opening Temerity in the 77-78 season, when the natural {{avalanche}} chutes of Steeplechase opened. Steeplechase was made safe by a bootpacking program whereby hikers were paid to march {{up and down the}} slopes, mashing down the early-season snow so it would hold throughout the season. Constant skier traffic effectively mashed down the subsequent <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> so that avalanche conditions would never be reached.|$|R
50|$|Snowpack forms from <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> that {{accumulate}} in geographic regions and high altitudes where the climate includes cold weather {{for extended periods}} during the year. Snowpacks are an important water resource that feed streams and rivers as they melt. Therefore, snowpacks are both the drinking water source for many communities and a potential source of flooding (in case of sudden melting). Snowpacks also contribute mass to glaciers in their accumulation zone.|$|R
60|$|Anon, {{the midnight}} walker reached the open. Here {{a carpet of}} coarse grass peeping through the thin <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> gave {{insecure}} foothold. He stumbled as he pursued his way. He was walking {{in the teeth of}} the northwesterly blast now and he could scarcely breathe, for the great gusts caught his throat, causing him to choke.|$|E
60|$|When {{the spring}} sun melted {{the snow in}} the woods the big pile remained, {{settling}} slowly as the days warmed. At midday the top <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> would melt and trickle down through the chips; by night it would freeze hard, gradually changing the snow within to soft ice. When all the snow in the woods was gone, that in the chip pile remained, kept from melting by the thick wooden blankets that covered it; and the longest summer would hardly be sufficient to melt {{it down to the}} bottom layer, which represented the first fall of snow in the previous autumn.|$|E
60|$|The day contrasted greatly {{with any}} he had yet experienced. Gray clouds {{obscured}} {{the walls of}} rock a few miles to the west, and Shefford saw squalls of snow like huge veils dropping down and spreading out. The wind cut with the keenness of a knife. Soon he was chilled to the bone. A squall swooped and roared down upon him, and the wind that bore the driving white pellets of snow, almost like hail, was so freezing bitter cold that the former wind seemed warm in comparison. The squall passed as swiftly as it had come, and it left Shefford so benumbed he could not hold the bridle. He tumbled off his horse and walked. By and by the sun came out and soon warmed him and melted the thin <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> on the sand. He {{was still on the}} trail of the Indian girl, but hers were now the only tracks he could see.|$|E
500|$|An ice core is a {{core sample}} that is {{typically}} removed from an ice sheet or a high mountain glacier.

5000|$|Flaine is {{situated}} on a geological plate of rock called the [...] "DÃ©sert de PlatÃ©". [...] This type of rock formation is extremely rugged and cracked looking. It {{is no surprise}} therefore that there an unusually large number of crevasses and potholes in the area, which are particularly visible in summer. Due to most of them being covered by thin <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow,</b> they are not visible in the winter. This makes skiing off piste in the Flaine area fairly dangerous.|$|R
500|$|It snowed heavily {{before the}} game, {{to the point}} where players for both teams had to clear <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> off <b>of</b> the field, making large piles <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> along the sides of the playing ground.The first half of the game went scoreless; the Baltimore American {{reported}} that [...] "the visitors pushed Navy every place but over the goal line in the first half".

60|$|Two {{days later}} they started, four llamas having {{been added to}} the caravan. Dias {{explained}} {{that it would not be}} necessary to take any natives to attend to these animals, as, once started, they would follow the mules without difficulty, especially if they were fed with them before starting. Three days' travelling brought them to the little town, which lay very high up in the hills. The cold here was bitter, and the party needed all their wraps, and were glad to get in motion as soon as it was light. Passing over a range of mountains above Paucartambo, where a thin <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> crunched under their feet, they began the tremendous descent into the plain. In a short time the morning mist cleared away. The road led through a tropical forest. It took them over three hours to reach the river Chirimayu, a descent of eleven thousand feet in the course of eight miles.|$|E
60|$|We will, after Taine's method, {{take one}} fact {{and let it}} speak for itself. Napoleon left a legacy in a codicil to his will {{to a man who}} tried to assassinate Wellington. There is the mediaeval Italian again! He was no more a Corsican than the Englishman born in India is a Hindoo. Read the lives of the Borgias, the Sforzas, the Medicis, and of all the lustful, cruel, broad-minded, art-loving, talented despots of the little Italian States, {{including}} Genoa, from which the Buonapartes migrated. There at once you get the real descent of the man, with all the stigmata clear upon him--the outward calm, the inward passion, the <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> above the volcano, everything which characterized the old despots of his native land, the pupils of Machiavelli, but all raised to the dimensions of genius. You can whitewash him as you may, but you will never get a layer thick enough to cover the stain of that cold-blooded deliberate endorsement of his noble adversary's assassination.|$|E
6000|$|Such fantasies, intermixed among graver toils of mind, {{have made}} the winter's day pass pleasantly. Meanwhile, the storm has raged without abatement, and now, as the brief {{afternoon}} declines, is tossing denser volumes to and fro about the atmosphere. On the window-sill there is a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> reaching halfway up the lowest pane of glass. The garden is one unbroken bed. Along the street are two or three spots of uncovered earth where the gust has whirled away the snow, heaping it elsewhere to the fence-tops or piling huge banks against the doors of houses. A solitary passenger is seen, now striding mid-leg deep across a drift, now scudding over the bare ground, while his cloak is swollen with the wind. And now the jingling of bells--a sluggish sound responsive to the horse's toilsome progress through the unbroken drifts--announces {{the passage of a}} sleigh with a boy clinging behind and ducking his head to escape detection by the driver. Next comes a sledge laden with wood for some unthrifty housekeeper whom winter has surprised at a cold hearth. But what dismal equipage now struggles along the uneven street? A sable hearse bestrewn with snow is bearing a dead man through the storm to his frozen bed. Oh how dreary is a burial in winter, when the bosom of Mother Earth has no warmth for her poor child! ...|$|E

40|$|Observations of {{precipitation}} {{performed with the}} five-channel passive Scanning Microwave Spectrometer of Nimbus 6 are discussed. It is shown that, at centimeter wavelengths, the rain emission is generally dominated by absorption processes except in the cores of intense precipitation cells where the wavelength dependence can shift markedly. The observations of rainfall over the ocean exhibit considerable long-range order in both instantaneous and two-week average maps. The observations <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> and ice also reveal interesting systematic behavior associated with the inhomogeneities and loss tangent of the bulk subsurface material.

60|$|One day, a {{week from}} Christmas, he had {{occasion}} to ride to Helston on some trifling affair. For half a week a blizzard had whirled about the coast, {{and he had been}} kept chafing indoors what time layer upon <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> was spread upon the countryside. On the fourth day, the storm being spent, the sun came forth, the skies were swept clear of clouds and all the countryside lay robed in a sun-drenched, dazzling whiteness. Sir Oliver called for his horse and rode forth alone through the crisp snow. He turned homeward very early in the afternoon, but when a couple of miles from Helston he found that his horse had cast a shoe. He dismounted, and bridle over arm tramped on through the sunlit vale between the heights of Pendennis and Arwenack, singing as he went. He came thus to Smithick and the door of the forge. About it stood a group of fishermen and rustics, for, {{in the absence of any}} inn just there, this forge was ever a point of congregation. In addition to the rustics and an itinerant merchant with his pack-horses, there were present Sir Andrew Flack, the parson from Penryn, and Master Gregory Baine, one of the Justices from the neighbourhood of Truro. Both were well known to Sir Oliver, and he stood in friendly gossip with them what time he waited for his horse.|$|E
60|$|Snow-houses.--Few {{travellers}} have habitually made snow-houses, except Sir J. Franklin's {{party and}} that of Dr. Rae. Great praises are bestowed on their comfort by all travellers, but skill and practice are required in building them. The mode of erection of these dome-shaped buildings is as follows:--It is to be understood that compact, underlying snow {{is necessary for the}} floor of the hut; and that the looser textured, upper <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow,</b> is used to build the house. First, select and mark out the circular plot on which the hut is to be raised. Then, cut out of that plot, with knives, deep slices of snow, 6 inches wide, 3 feet long, and of a depth equal to that of the layer of loose snow, say one or two feet. These slices are to be of a curved shape, so as to form a circular ring when placed on their edges, and of a suitable radius for the first row of snow-bricks. Other slices are cut on the same principle for the succeeding rows; but when the domed roof has to be made, the snow-bricks must be cut with the necessary double curvature. A conical plug fills up the centre of the dome. Loose snow is next heaped over the house, to fill up crevices. Lastly a doorway is cut out with knives; also a window, which is glazed with a sheet of the purest ice at hand. For inside accommodation there should be a pillar or two of snow to support the lamps.|$|E
60|$|The steel-trap {{used by the}} Indians {{is almost}} similar to the {{ordinary}} rat-trap of England, with this difference, {{that it is a}} little larger, is destitute of teeth, and has two springs in place of one. A chain is attached to one spring for the purpose of fixing a weight to the trap, so that the animal caught {{may not be able to}} drag it far from the place where it was set. The track in the snow enables the hunter to find his trap again. It is generally set so that the jaws, when spread out flat, are exactly on a level with the snow. The chain and weight are both hid, and a thin <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> spread on top of the trap. The bait (which generally consists of chips of a frozen partridge, rabbit, or fish) is then scattered around in every direction; and, with the exception of this, nothing distinguishes the spot. Foxes, beavers, wolves, lynx, and other animals are caught in this way, sometimes by a fore leg, sometimes by a hind leg, and sometimes by two legs at once, and occasionally by the nose. Of all these ways the Indians prefer catching by two legs, as there is then not the slightest possibility of the animal escaping. When foxes are caught by one leg, they often eat it off close to the trap, and escape on the other three. I have frequently seen this happen; and I once saw a fox caught which had evidently escaped in this way, as one of its legs was gone, and the stump healed up and covered again with hair. When they are caught by the nose they are almost sure to escape, unless taken out of the trap very soon after being caught, as their snouts are so sharp or wedge-like that they can pull them from between the jaws of the trap without much difficulty.|$|E
