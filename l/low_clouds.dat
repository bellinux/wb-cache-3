With a large swirl of <b>low</b> <b>clouds</b> and little convection, the system tracked westward for two weeks across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, before crossing Central America on August22. On August29, the system became better organized, consisting of a broad low pressure area and thunderstorm activity.

In this study, {{we examine}} marine <b>low</b> <b>cloud</b> cover {{variability}} in the Southeast Pacific and its association with lower-tropospheric stability (LTS) across a spectrum of timescales. On both daily and interannual timescales, LTS and <b>low</b> <b>cloud</b> amount are very well correlated in austral summer (DJF). Meanwhile in winter (JJA), when ambient LTS increases, the LTS–low cloud relationship substantially weakens. The DJF LTS–low cloud relationship also weakens in years with unusually large ambient LTS values.

Thus the LTS– <b>low</b> <b>cloud</b> relationship is strongly modulated by the seasonal cycle and the ENSO phenomenon.

30|$|Equilibrium climate {{sensitivity}} (ECS) to doubling of atmospheric CO 2 concentration {{is a key}} index for understanding the Earth’s climate history and prediction of future climate changes. Tropical <b>low</b> <b>cloud</b> feedback, the predominant factor for uncertainty in modeled ECS, diverges both in sign and magnitude among climate models. Despite its importance, the uncertainty in ECS and <b>low</b> <b>cloud</b> feedback remains a challenge. Recently, researches based on observations and climate models have demonstrated a possibility that the tropical <b>low</b> <b>cloud</b> feedback in a perturbed climate can be constrained by the observed relationship between cloud, sea surface temperature and atmospheric dynamic and thermodynamic structures. The observational constraint on the tropical <b>low</b> <b>cloud</b> feedback suggests a higher ECS range than raw range obtained from climate model simulations. In addition, newly devised modeling frameworks that address both spreads among different model structures and parameter settings have contributed to evaluate possible ranges of the uncertainty in ECS and <b>low</b> <b>cloud</b> feedback. Further observational and modeling approaches and their combinations may help to advance toward dispelling the clouds of uncertainty.|$|R

5|$|Along {{with wind}} direction, cloud cover {{is one of}} the oldest {{atmospheric}} conditions to be coded on a station model. The circle in the middle of the station model represents cloud cover. In the United Kingdom, when the observation is taken from an automated weather observation site, the shape is a triangle. If the shape is completely filled in, it is overcast. If conditions are completely clear, the circle or triangle is empty. If conditions are partly cloudy, the circle or triangle is partially filled in. The cloud cover shape has different looks depending upon how many oktas (eighths of the sky) are covered by cloud. A sky half full of clouds would have a circle that was half white and half black. Below the shape indicating sky cover, the station model can indicate the coverage of <b>low</b> <b>clouds,</b> in oktas, and the ceiling height in hundreds of feet. The ceiling height is the height at which more than half the sky is covered by clouds.|$|E

The two Corsair squadrons were assigned to No. 6 Naval Fighter Wing aboard the carrier on 14 August. The first attack was {{on the morning of}} 22 August when Formidable launched 24 Corsairs and 12 Barracudas against the German battleship and nearby targets, all of which returned. A smoke screen again protected the Tirpitz and no damage was inflicted. Another attack scheduled for the afternoon had to be cancelled because of <b>low</b> <b>clouds.</b> A further attack could not be mounted until 24 August because of bad weather. The carrier contributed 23 Corsairs and 16 Barracudas, and 3 of the fighters were shot down over the target. The Tirpitz was lightly damaged by two bomb hits during this attack.

5|$|On 6 January, the Japanese convoy {{carrying}} Okabe's force {{set out for}} Lae from Rabaul. Forewarned by Ultra, USAAF and RAAF aircraft spotted, shadowed {{and attacked}} the convoy, which was shielded by <b>low</b> <b>clouds</b> and Japanese fighters. The Allies claimed to have shot down 69 Japanese aircraft {{for the loss of}} 10 of their own. A P-38 pilot, First Lieutenant Richard Bong claimed three, becoming an ace. A RAAF Catalina of No. 11 Squadron RAAF under the command of Flight Lieutenant David Vernon made a night bombing attack on the convoy which sank the transport Nichiryu Maru. Destroyers rescued 739 of the 1,100 troops on board, but the ship took with it all of Okabe's medical supplies. Another transport, Myoko Maru, was so badly damaged at Lae by USAAF B-25s {{that it had to be}} beached. Nonetheless, the convoy succeeded in reaching Lae on 7 January and landing about 4,000 troops.

5|$|The {{invasion}} planners specified a set {{of conditions}} regarding {{the timing of the}} invasion, deeming only a few days in each month suitable. A full moon was desirable, as it would provide illumination for aircraft pilots and have the highest tides. The Allies wanted to schedule the landings for shortly before dawn, midway between low and high tide, with the tide coming in. This would improve the visibility of obstacles the enemy had placed on the beach while minimising the amount of time the men had to spend exposed in the open. Specific criteria were also set for wind speed, visibility, and cloud cover. Eisenhower had tentatively selected 5 June as the date for the assault. However, on 4 June, conditions were clearly unsuitable for a landing; high winds and heavy seas made it impossible to launch landing craft, and <b>low</b> <b>clouds</b> would prevent aircraft from finding their targets.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between satellite-derived <b>low</b> <b>cloud</b> frequency and {{the occurrence of}} tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF) in Taiwan was investigated. From daily MODIS cloud mask products between 2003 and 2012 the <b>low</b> <b>cloud</b> class was extracted and mean <b>low</b> <b>cloud</b> frequency was calculated for Taiwan. This <b>low</b> <b>cloud</b> frequency map was blended with an existing plot-based vegetation classification for Taiwan to analyze the {{relationship between}} <b>low</b> <b>cloud</b> frequency and TMCF occurrence. Receiver operating characteristics curves and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) were used to analyze if a relationship exists. No relationship was found for all four TMCF types taken together (AUC = 0. 61) and for the dominant TMCF type, Quercus montane evergreen broad-leaved cloud forest (AUC = 0. 5). Strong relationships were found for the two spatially-restricted TMCF types, Fagus montane deciduous broad-leaved cloud forest (AUC = 0. 91) and Pasania-Elaeocarpus montane evergreen broad-leaved forest (AUC = 0. 84), {{as well as for}} the second dominant type Chamaecyparis montane mixed cloud forest (AUC = 0. 74). The results show that <b>low</b> <b>cloud</b> frequency thresholds might be associated with specific cloud forest types in Taiwan. Further studies should incorporate information about cloud base height, cloud density, and cloud immersion time as well as satellite-based cloud frequency information with a higher temporal resolution. Combination with satellite-based land cover classifications for Taiwan would allow quasi-continuous observation of TMCF changes.

Sunshine and synoptic cloud records both indicate that the global total cloud cover has increased during the past century. This increase in total cloud cover argues against a dominating role by solar activity (via GCR) over cloud formation on centennial time scales. Either the predicted <b>low</b> <b>cloud</b> decrease has not occurred or the medium-high level cloud has increased {{to a greater extent}} than <b>low</b> <b>cloud</b> has decreased.

He had also logged 52 hours of instrument flying training, although had passed only his written examination, and was not yet qualified to operate in weather that required flying solely by reference to instruments. He and Dwyer Flying Service itself were certified to operate only under visual flight rules, which essentially require that the pilot must be able to see where he is going. However, {{on the night of the}} accident, visual flight would have been virtually impossible due to the <b>low</b> <b>clouds,</b> the lack of a visible horizon, and the absence of ground lights over the sparsely populated area.|$|E

40|$|Representations of Boundary Layer Cloudiness and Surface Wind Probability Distributions in Subtropical Marine Stratus and Stratocumulus Regions Yanping He 153 pages Directed by Dr. Robert E. Dickinson A simple <b>low</b> <b>cloud</b> cover {{scheme is}} {{developed}} for the subtropical marine stratus and stratocumulus (MSC) regions. It {{is based on a}} modified CIN concept named the Lower Troposphere Available Dry Inhibition Energy (ADIN). The e-folder time for the local change of ADIN is found to be approximately 6 to 7 hours. On monthly and longer timescales, local productions of ADIN are balanced by local destructions of ADIN within lower troposphere. Dynamical transport of environmental dry static energy and surface evaporation lead to the variations of cloud top radiative cooling, which is a linear function of <b>low</b> <b>cloud</b> cover. Data analysis suggests that total ADIN dynamical transport plays the most important role in determining the seasonal variations and spatial variations of <b>low</b> <b>cloud</b> amounts¡£ The new scheme produces realistic seasonal and spatial variations of both EECRA ship observation and satellite observations in all MSC regions. It explains 25 % more covariance than that using Klein-Hartmann (KH) scheme for monthly ISCCP <b>low</b> <b>cloud</b> amount near the Peruvian and Canarian region during the period from 1985 to 1997 £¬it better represents the relationship between ENSO index and <b>low</b> <b>cloud</b> cover variations near the Peruvian region. When implemented into NCAR CAM 3. 1, it systematically reduces the model biases in the summertime spatial variations of <b>low</b> <b>cloud</b> amount and downward solar radiation in the Peruvian, California, and Canarian regions. Model simulated summertime cloud liquid water path, large scale precipitation, and surface fluxes are also significantly changed. A single predictor named Lower troposphere available thermal inhibition energy (ATIN) is also shown to be more skillful than the lower tropospheric stability in diagnosing <b>low</b> <b>cloud</b> stratiform clouds in the monthly and seasonal timescales. On synoptic timescale, dynamical transport of available dry inhibition energy and surface evaporation are better correlated with marine <b>low</b> <b>cloud</b> amount variations than ATIN and lower troposphere stability. The influence of boundary layer clouds, ocean surface SST, and large scale divergence on the stochastic dynamics of local ocean surface winds are addressed using QuikSCAT and AIRS satellite observations and a simple conceptual model in the southeast Pacific. The ocean surface pressure gradient depends on both the boundary layer height and temperature inversion strength. Marine boundary clouds are diagnosed using the cloud cover scheme developed in Chapter 2. The model successfully reproduces the observed mean state, the standard deviation, and skewness of local surface wind speeds in the southeast Pacific. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Dr. Robert E.
