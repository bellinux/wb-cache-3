40|$|The greater omentum {{has been}} known to possess a potent angiogenic effect, when it is {{transposed}} to the peripheral areas of the body. The factor responsible for the angiogenesis was reported to be present in the lipid fraction extracted from the omentum and was confirmed to be identical to PGE 2. However, PGE 2 does not enhance the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells in vitro, but is known to generally suppress cell proliferation. In the present study, the endothelial cell growth factor was extracted from the <b>bovine</b> greater <b>omentum,</b> and purification and characterization of the factor were performed. The lipid fraction derived from the <b>bovine</b> <b>omentum</b> exhibited no significant growth-promoting activity when tested with bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). However, the lipids appear to indirectly stimulate neovascularization when injected in vivo. The present work demonstrated the presence of vascular endothelial cell growth factor in the water-soluble extracts of <b>bovine</b> <b>omentum.</b> Gel permeation chromatography of the acid-treated extracts gave two peaks of growth promoting activity apparently corresponding to the molecular weights (MW) of 96, 000 and 21, 000. The MW 21, 000 growth factor is a dominant component, and this factor was partially purified, approximately 120 -fold, by ammonium sulfate precipitation (30 - 80 % saturation), acid treatment, hydroxylapatite chromatography, Sephadex G- 100 gel exclusion chromatography, and finally phenyl-sepharose chromatography. Heparin affinity chromatography revealed that the factor had no affinity for heparin. The MW 21, 000 growth factor exhibited no additive effect when tested in the presence of heparin. The factor had no growth promoting effect without fetal bovine serum. The activity of MW 21, 000 growth factor was stable at trypsin treatment, but inactivated by heating at 100 ℃ for 2 min, or by acid (pH 2. 3) and alkaline (pH 11. 2) treatments. These properties clearly distinguish the MW 21, 000 growth factor from other well-documented heparin binding growth factor (HBGF). The MW 21, 000 growth factor is quite likely distinct from other vascular endothelial cell growth factors, so far described for various tissues and cells. We postulate that the MW 21, 000 growth factor detected in the present work contributes to the potent angiogenic activity of the omentum...|$|R

In mixed films, evidence {{was found that}} the two components were miscible. On the other hand, at higher surface pressures, phase separation occurs in the cases of PC and sulphatides. Measuring the area requirement and the collapse pressure the stability of both lipid and the peptide was increased in particular due to ganglioside-valinomycin interaction. The addition of 10 − 5 M calcium into the subphase at 20 and 37 °C and surface pressures of 10 and 20 mN/m led to a condensing effect in ganglioside mixtures, with formation of aggregates as indicated also by the nearly ideal behaviour of two component monolayers...|$|R

The primary outcome was being alive and extubated at 48 hours post-randomization. Secondary outcomes included need for re-dosing, duration of respiratory support and oxygen, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, mortality and complications during administration. Three centers recruited 87 infants (mean 26. 7 weeks and 906 grams) at a mean age of 5. 9 hours, between March 2013 and December 2015. 21 / 42 (50 %) were alive and extubated at 48 hours in the poractant alfa group vs 26 / 45 (57. 8 %) in the <b>bovine</b> <b>lipid</b> extract surfactant group; adjusted OR 0. 76 (95 % CI 0. 30 - 1. 93) (p = 0. 56).

40|$|The {{effect of}} acetic acid on hepatic lipid {{metabolism}} in ruminants differs significantly {{from that in}} monogastric animals. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate the regulation mechanism of acetic acid on the hepatic lipid metabolism in dairy cows. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway plays a key role in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism. In vitro, bovine hepatocytes were cultured and treated with different concentrations of sodium acetate (neutralized acetic acid) and BML- 275 (an AMPKα inhibitor). Acetic acid consumed a large amount of ATP, resulting in an increase in AMPKα phosphorylation. The increase in AMPKα phosphorylation increased the expression and transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α, which upregulated the expression of lipid oxidation genes, thereby increasing <b>lipid</b> oxidation in <b>bovine</b> hepatocytes. Furthermore, elevated AMPKα phosphorylation reduced the expression and transcriptional activity of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 c and the carbohydrate responsive element-binding protein, which reduced the expression of lipogenic genes, thereby decreasing <b>lipid</b> biosynthesis in <b>bovine</b> hepatocytes. In addition, activated AMPKα inhibited the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Consequently, the triglyceride content in the acetate-treated hepatocytes was significantly decreased. These results indicate that acetic acid activates the AMPKα signaling pathway to increase lipid oxidation and decrease <b>lipid</b> synthesis in <b>bovine</b> hepatocytes, thereby reducing liver fat accumulation in dairy cows...|$|R

The tilted-condensed phase consisted of domains {{not only on the}} micrometer scale, as detected previously by fluorescence microscopy, but also on the nanometer scale, which is below the resolution limits of conventional optical methods. The nanodomains were embedded uniformly within the liquid-expanded phase. On compression, the microdomains broke up into nanodomains, thereby appearing to contribute to tilted-condensed and liquid-expanded phase remixing. Addition of surfactant protein A altered primarily the nanodomains and promoted the formation of multilayers. We conclude that the nanodomains play a predominant role in affecting the biophysical properties of PS monolayers and the monolayer-to-multilayer transition...|$|R
40|$|Pulmonary {{surfactant}} is {{a complex}} mixture of lipids and proteins that forms a surface-active film at the air-water interface of alveoli capable of reducing surface tension to near 0 mN/m. The role of cholesterol, the major neutral lipid component of pulmonary surfactant, remains uncertain. We studied the physiological effect of cholesterol by monitoring blood oxygenation levels of surfactant-deficient rats treated or not treated with <b>bovine</b> <b>lipid</b> extract surfactant (BLES) containing zero or physiological amounts of cholesterol. Our results indicate {{no significant difference between}} BLES and BLES containing cholesterol immediately after treatment; however, during ventilation, BLES-treated animals maintained higher PaO 2 values compared to BLES + cholesterol-treated animals. We used a captive bubble tensiometer to show that physiological amounts of cholesterol do not have a detrimental effect on the surface activity of BLES at 37 °C. The effect of cholesterol on topography and lateral organization of BLES Langmuir-Blodgett films was also investigated using atomic force microscopy. Our data indicate that cholesterol induces the formation of domains within liquid-ordered domains (Lo). We used time-of-flight-secondary ion mass spectrometry and principal component analysis to show that cholesterol is concentrated in the Lo phase, where it induces structural changes...|$|R

The {{mechanism by which}} PS monolayers reach such low surface tensions and maintain film stability remains unknown.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} 0 – 3 % (v/v) ethanol and {{acetonitrile}} on water diffusional permeability of bovine and chicken {{red blood cells}} (RBCs) was studied using a pulse 1 H-T 2 NMR technique. Transmembrane water diffusional exchange times, τexch, of 9. 2 ± 0. 46 ms and 18. 3 ± 1. 0 ms were determined for bovine and chicken erythrocytes at 27. 5 ° C, respectively. Arrhenius activation energies Ea of water diffusion were 20. 4 and 35. 8 kJ mol− 1. Ethanol, and acetonitrile being 2 -fold more effective, markedly increased both τexch and Ea in bovine RBC {{as compared to the}} well-known mercurial inhibitor of water channels, p-chloromercuribenzene sulfonate. Chicken RBCs that have no protein water channels, were found to be completely insensitive for either agent. It was suggested that ethanol and acetonitrile partitioning into the <b>lipid</b> phase of <b>bovine</b> RBC membrane affects the permeability of CHIP 28 water channel but not the lipid confined water diffusion. The results suggest that the inhibition of transmembrane movement of water via CHIP 28 channels might be involved in the anti-hemolytic action of anaesthetics such as ethanol...|$|R
40|$|AbstractExposing <b>bovine</b> <b>lipid</b> extract {{surfactant}} (BLES), {{a clinical}} surfactant, to {{reactive oxygen species}} arising from hypochlorous acid or the Fenton reaction resulted {{in an increase in}} lipid (conjugated dienes, lipid aldehydes) and protein (carbonyls) oxidation products and a reduction in surface activity. Experiments where oxidized phospholipids (PL) were mixed with BLES demonstrated that this addition hampered BLES biophysical activity. However the effects were only moderately greater than with control PL. These results imply a critical role for protein oxidation. BLES oxidation by either method resulted in alterations in surfactant proteins SP-B and SP-C, as evidenced by altered Coomassie blue and silver staining. Western blot analyses showed depressed reactivity with specific antibodies. Oxidized SP-C showed decreased palmitoylation. Reconstitution experiments employing PL, SP-B, and SP-C isolated from control or oxidized BLES demonstrated that protein oxidation was more deleterious than lipid oxidation. Furthermore, addition of control SP-B can improve samples containing oxidized SP-C, but not vice versa. We conclude that surfactant oxidation arising from reactive oxygen species generated by air pollution or leukocytes interferes with surfactant function through oxidation of surfactant PL and proteins, but that protein oxidation, in particular SP-B modification, produces the major deleterious effects...|$|R
40|$|AbstractGangliosides, added exogenously at {{concentrations}} of 10 – 100 μM, inhibit intrinsic protein kinase activities in purified rat brain myelin. Multivalent neoganglioproteins – gangliosides covalently attached, via their <b>lipid</b> moieties, to <b>bovine</b> serum albumin – {{were much more}} potent, inhibiting myelin protein phosphorylation half-maximally at a concentration of 100 nM. Different ganglioside conjugates varied 10 -fold in inhibitory potency; GT 1 b-conjugates being the most potent and GM 3 -conjugates being the least. Conjugates of ganglioside oligosaccharides, lacking the lipid moiety, did not inhibit myelin protein phosphorylation, whereas conjugates of sphingosine inhibited nearly as potently as GT 1 b conjugates. Conjugate-mediated inhibition of myelin protein phosphorylation was due to inhibition of a protein serine kinase activity rather than activation of a phosphatase activity. We conclude that (i) clustered gangliosides or sphingosine are potent myelin protein kinase inhibitors, and (ii) sphingolipid metabolism is not required for myelin protein kinase inhibition. In contrast to their effects on myelin protein phosphorylation, ganglioside conjugates stimulated phosphorylation of a presumptive axon membrane protein. The data support the conclusion that gangliosides and other sphingolipids, when appropriately clustered, are potent modulators of central nervous system protein phosphorylation...|$|R
