40|$|AbstractAdditive {{manufacturing}} (AM) is most used in prototype {{production and}} other processes upstream of series production. However, {{in recent years}} additive manufacturing has also moved into series production environments substituting for established systems. With AM, {{it is possible to}} improve production in terms of material consumption, manufacturing costs, and lightweight design. Accordingly, it is possible to create complexly arched <b>laminating</b> <b>moulds</b> directly from the CAD-model instead of milling them from solid material as is frequently done for the production of carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) components in autoclaves. This work analyses the potential of CFRP-laminating moulds as rapid tooling moulds generated by fused deposition modeling. A rounded cuboid will be considered with different reinforcement patterns as well as various wall thicknesses. Normal autoclave conditions will be simulated with pressure variation and high temperature stress varying over time. In conclusion, the results prove the capability of rapid tooling thermoplastic <b>laminating</b> <b>moulds</b> for manufacturing CFRP components in autoclaves...|$|R

A linear thermoelastic {{approach has been}} applied to predict the related residual stress state before demoulding, giving an estimate of the stress induced by polymerisation strain. The results from the linear approach are confirmed by a viscoelastic finite element model including the cure conversion and related change in viscosity. It is concluded that the curvature measurement of unsymmetrical laminates is an accurate method for the prediction of the transverse residual stress, making it suitable as a benchmark for complex stress modelling. keyterms: residual stress, thermoset, cure shrinkage, viscoelastic, finite elements...|$|R
40|$|Regular {{composite}} production moulds {{often lack}} material and energy efficiency. These moulds either milled out of solid blocks or laminated over a master model, {{take long to}} produce and come at a high cost. In addition, the durability of <b>laminated</b> <b>moulds</b> is limited. The goal {{of this research is}} the development and technical-economical validation of faster producible, cheaper, longer lasting and material and energy efficient moulds based on plastically deformed metal sheets. Two equally spaced metal sheets are used to create a cavity through which a heat transferring fluid can flow, ensuring fast and homogenous cooling or heating resulting in reduced residual stresses in the produced composite material. Since the sheets are reasonably thin, less material has to undergo temperature changes resulting in a faster and a more energy efficient process with material-efficient moulds. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{high cost}} of raw materials, high labour costs and lengthy cycle times have limited the use of {{conventional}} ply-based composites in the automotive industry. This thesis seeks to identify the potential of using low cost discontinuous fibre composites (DFCs) for structural applications. Properties of DFCs are governed by the degree of homogeneity of the reinforcement and discontinuities at the fibre ends, which cause stress concentrations; thereby limiting the mechanical performance of the material. This work focuses on material characterisation of <b>laminates</b> <b>moulded</b> from discontinuous carbon fibre preforms manufactured by a robotic spray process. Through the culmination of this work, a suitable design methodology for automotive applications has been identified. Design procedures for aerospace have also been considered. An analytical model has been developed to determine the tensile stiffness and strength of a discontinuous carbon fibre preform composite. The model can be used within automotive and aerospace design methodologies to define material properties, {{but a number of}} other factors must be considered. Areal mass of the preform has been identified as the governing factor in achieving target compaction levels. Poor homogeneity in thin parts prevents the ability to achieve high volume fractions, which determines mechanical performance. It has been demonstrated that the matrix has a greater influence on the properties of DFCs when compared to continuous fibre composites. Toughened resins were particularly effective in improving tensile strength of DFCs that exhibited poor homogeneity. Damage tolerance of DFCs has been evaluated through open-hole and compression after impact testing. Higher property retention was observed compared to continuous fibre equivalents. Greater damage tolerance of DFCs could lead to increased weight-saving in structural applications. However, current safety factors based on conventional laminates may be too conservative and could lead to over-engineering thus limiting the potential of the material...|$|R

40|$|Seamless bra cup {{moulding}} is {{an important}} manufacturing technique for the apparel industry,and in particular,for bra production. Polyurethane(PU) foams and/or fabric-foam <b>laminated</b> sheets are <b>moulded</b> into a desirable cup shape in order to fit the three-dimensional(3 D) breast contour. Such foam cups not only provide {{a wide range of}} designs combined with different levels of softness and support,but also reduce production costs with minimum cutting and sewing of seams. In this study,two selected PU foam and fabric materials typically used for bra cup moulding were examined. Their respective performance behaviour in relation to different moulding temperatures and time changes were recorded and analyzed. The results reveal that cup heights are greatly affected by the use of foam and/or fabric-foam <b>laminated</b> materials. High <b>moulding</b> temperatures and/or prolonged dwell time could be required when deforming laminated materials and setting large cup sizes. Nevertheless,cup height cannot be taken as the only criteria to determine the optimal moulding conditions,and this is especially the case for large cup sizes. The design of mould heads is a major factor that affects the dimension changes of foam cups. In this respect,to control the foam moulding process,it is suggested that bra manufacturers examine the fabric/foam material properties to determine the optimal moulding condition,and quantify the shape of foam cups to enhance the design and development process of aluminum mould heads.

40|$|The {{increasingly}} high {{capital investment}} required for large autoclaves, ovens and facilities for the processmg of large composite components creates {{a number of}} financial constraints for the development and manufacturing of larger composite aircraft products. This thesis has investigated the use of heated tooling {{as an alternative to}} the use of autoclave and oven curing. A design and development methodology for heated tools has been proposed while a number of heated tooling options have been identified and described. Three representative heated tool options using heater mats, electro-conductive textiles and wire heater elements have been evaluated. The curing capability of a prototype heated tool incorporating wire heater elements has been proved by carrying out a number of curing tests on RFI (Resin Fihn Infusion) <b>laminates.</b> The <b>moulded</b> <b>laminates</b> indicate that a 78 - 83 % extent of cure is achieved prior to post-cure. The fibre and void content of cured laminates has also been verified through acid digestion and microscopy, where an acceptable fibre volume fraction (Vf) of 55 - 57 % and a void content of less than 2 % have been achieved. The usefulness of ID and 3 D thermal Finite Element Analysis for the design and simulation of heated tooling has also been studied. A manufacturing and cost analysis study carried out has identified potential production implications, while the cost effectiveness of heated tooling compared to oven and autoclave processmg has been indicated. Cost reductions are noted in capital investments, operational costs and production set-up costs per part. The work described in this thesis gives valuable information for the implementation of heated tooling as a new processing method for aerospace composite products.

40|$|Autoclave {{technology}} {{is one of}} the most popular techniques for manufacturing polymer-based composite materials for aeronautical and automotive applications. During the process, consolidation of the composite takes place by applying a temperature and pressure cycle to the laminate, which has been preshaped according to the desired part, located on a tool and bagged. Autoclave manufacturing of composite materials is chosen when a medium/low manufacturing rate product with high long fiber content, low dimensional tolerances and repeatable material properties is required. The autoclave essentially is a pressurized cylindrical oven to achieve the prescribed program of pressure and temperature to obtain the final high performances composite product. The autoclave molding {{technology is}} a pressure forming technology where the work piece to be realized is sealed by a vacuum bag and its shape is defined by the supporting tool. In particular, the combination of the vacuum applied upon the work piece with the pressure exerted by the fluid pressure inside the autoclave allows to obtain a minimal presence of voids within the laminate and to achieve the highest mechanical performance now achievable with a composite material.

40|$|Abstract. LARCTM-SCI (Langley Research Center- Semi-Crystaline polyImide) is an {{aromatic}} polyimide {{based on}} 3, 40 -oxydianiline and 3, 30, 4, 40 -biphenyl tetracarboxylic dianhydride. This polyimide was synthesized and evaluated {{for use as}} a neat resin and a matrix resin for advanced composites. Three 30 % w/w solids polyamic acid/N-methypyrrolidone solutions were prepared using 2, 3 and 4 % stoichiometric imbalances end-capped with phthalic anhydride to provide polyimides with theoretical number average molecular weights of approximately 22 800, 15 100 and 11 400 g mol− 1 respectively. Unidirectional IM 7 carbon fibre prepreg was prepared from these three resins using the Langley multipurpose tape machine. Thermal and rheological properties and the solvent/volatile depletion rates along with crystallization kinetics were characterized for the resin scraps taken from the prepreg tapes. Processing characteristics of the LARCTM-SCI resin were thoroughly understood from these results, and a workable moulding cycle was designed for this composite. Composite <b>laminates</b> were <b>moulded</b> at 410 C at either 200 or 300 psi, which consistently yielded good consolidation and high-quality panels as measured by C-scan, acid digestion and optical photomicrography. The composite mechanical properties were also obtained. Short beam shear strength was 15 ksi at RT. Longitudinal flexural strength was 295 ksi at RT and 200 ksi at 177 C. Excellent fracture toughness of 6. 9 in-lb/in 2 was obtained. Excellent values of transverse flexural strength and longitudinal tensile strength indicated a good translation of fibre properties into the composite. Un-notched longitudinal compression strength of 163 ksi was comparable to typical thermoplastic composites. An open hole compression strength of 55 ksi suggested good damage tolerance for this composite. 1...|$|R
40|$|Reinforced {{and plain}} {{polymers}} are highly elastic. In order to measure strain of parts made of these, strain sensors {{have to be}} highly elastic too. Such sensors, certainly for cyclic loading conditions with high amplitudes, are not available. Pseudoelastic shape memory alloys are used to realise high performance strain sensors with high elasticity. These sensors can be elastically strained up to 80, 000 µm/m. In cyclic loading conditions strain levels or amplitudes of about 20, 000 µm/m are possible. The high elasticity stems from the stress-induced phase transformation of the SMA. This phase transformation involves a comparably strong specific electrical resistivity change together with long elastic strain variations. The determined gauge factor exceeds 5 and is {{higher than that of}} most of the conventional metallic strain gauges. Sensor structures can be made of wires. These can be embedded into plastics and fibre reinforced plastics. The integration of sensors is possible via injection <b>moulding,</b> <b>laminating</b> and infiltrating processes.

40|$|A {{research}} was conducted to discover the screw withdrawal resistance of <b>moulded</b> <b>laminated</b> veneer lumbers made from oil palm trunks (MLVOP). The MLVOPs were manufactured separately with three different veneer arrangements namely S 100 % (each ply came from the superior part), SS-CI (surface superior and core inferior) and S-I (alternate superior and inferior parts). The veneers {{were divided into two}} groups. One group of veneers was bonded with urea formaldehyde (UF) resin to MLVOPs and the other was bonded with phenol formaldehyde (PF). The veneers were pressed at a temperature of 110 ºC for 20 min. The pressures applied to press the veneers to MLVOPs were 1500 psi, 2000 psi and 2500 psi. The study showed that the pressures and S-I veneer arrangement gave significant effects to the screw withdrawal resistance of UF-bonded and PF-bonded MLVOPs. MLVOPs with S-I veneer arrangement achieved the highest mean screw withdrawal resistance values when they were bonded with UF resin then pressed with 1500 psi and 2500 psi and bonded with PF resin and pressed with 1500 psi.

40|$|Conformal cooling {{channels}} {{follow the}} cavity shape and {{can provide a}} better cooling performance in injection <b>moulds.</b> <b>Laminated</b> tooling {{is one of the}} techniques for manufacturing injection moulds with conformal cooling systems. A laminated tool is made by stacking metal sheets of varying thicknesses from which pre–calculated profiles have been cut. The stacked sheets result in a jagged die surface that has to be finished before use. Although larger number of small thickness sheets result in small irregularities that can be finished easily, it increases the cost of profile cutting process. Therefore, one of the issues in laminated tooling is determination of sheet thicknesses so that the laminated die can be made optimally. In this paper, an optimization method is presented to find the best size of the various laminas based on CAD model surface geometry such that the surface jaggedness and the number of slice is reduced at the same time. The final mould is fabricated based on suggested optimization method. It is then tested to show the improvement in cooling performance as compared to the same die with conventional cooling channels.

40|$|Needle fibre calcite {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{ubiquitous}} habits of calcite in vadose environments (caves deposits, soil pores, etc.). Its origin, either through inorganic, indirect or direct biological processes, has long been debated. In this study, investigations at 11 sites in Europe, Africa and Central America support arguments for its biogenic origin. The wide range of needle morphologies is the result of a gradual evolution of the simplest type, a rod. This rod is the elementary brick which, by aggregation and welding, builds more complex needles. The absence of cross-welded needles implies that they are welded in a mould, or under a longitudinal and unidirectional constraint, before being released inside the soil pores. The difference between the lengthening of the needles and the c axis can be explained by the existence of needles observed under a scanning electron microscope in organic sleeves, which can act as a <b>mould</b> during <b>rod</b> growth. Complex morphologies with epitaxial outgrowths on straight rods cannot have grown entirely inside organic microtubes; they must result from soil diagenesis after the release of straight rods in a soil-free medium. Whisker crystals are interpreted as the result of growth and coalescence of euhedral crystals on a rod. Rhomb chains are considered to be the consequence of successive epitaxial growth steps on a needle during variations in growth conditions. Isotopic signatures for needle fibre calcite vary from - 16. 63 [per mille] to + 1. 10 [per mille] and from - 8. 63 [per mille] to - 2. 25 [per mille] for Delta 13 C and Delta 18 O, respectively. The absence of high Delta 18 O values for needle fibre calcite precludes a purely physicochemical origin (evaporative) for this particular habit of calcite. As epitaxial growth cannot precipitate in the same conditions as initial needles, needle fibre calcite stable isotopic signatures should be used with caution as a proxy for palaeoenvironmental reconstructions. In addition, it is suggested that the term needle fibre calcite should be kept for the original biogenic form. The other habit should be referred to as epitaxial forms of needle fibre calcite...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of peristaltic pumps is mainly governed by their tubing or hose materials. Research {{and development in}} this area is therefore very important for peristaltic pump manufacturers to keep in front of the competition and to open up new applications to enable further market penetration. Another aspect of this is of course price; performance and cost have to be in balance. As an approach to fabricate a new tube material, the field of negative Poisson's ratio (or: auxetic) materials is explored. The combined deformations of tensile, compression and shear in a peristaltic pump tube may well benefit from the specific characteristics of auxetic materials. Materials can be designed to keep their dimensions constant in directions perpendicular to an applied load. This is referred to as "auxetic balancing". Finite element modelling shows that lowering the Poisson's ratio will rapidly decrease the maximum stresses in the cross-section of an occluded tube. Optimum values for the Poisson's ratio are found to be between - 0. 1 and + 0. 1, preferentially being o. The re-entrant honeycomb structure is selected for initial trials, but manufacturing of this structure at the desired dimension proved to be too difficult at this time. Instead, electrospun nanofibre membranes are selected as the reinforcement structure. A liquid silicone elastomer is used as the matrix material. Key characteristics for the new material are derived from baseline test results on existing tubing. Laminates are manufactured from electrospun nylon 6 nanofibre membranes coated with a liquid silicone rubber. Compression moulding is used to cure the nylon 6 - silicone rubber laminate, to give two effects: it ensures impregnation of the membrane and the compression deforms the nanofibre structure {{in such a way that}} it will become auxetic through-the-thickness. Flat sheet laminates of 2 mm thickness are manufactured with 14 layers of reinforcement. A reinforcing effect and substantial lowering of the through-the-thickness Poisson's ratio is observed for the laminates at low strains. At higher strains (> 50 %) the effect of the reinforcement diminishes and the Poisson's ratio of the laminate and pure silicone rubber equalises. Finally, tubular laminates are manufactured and the resulting tubes are tested in a peristaltic pump with some promising results (> 1 million occlusions before failure). Tube performance is not yet at the required level, but with further optimisation of the <b>laminating</b> process, <b>mould</b> design and (post-) curing large steps forward can be made.

40|$|Wear {{behaviour}} of sand cast Cu- 11 Ni- 6 Sn alloy was studied using pin-on-disc wear tester with {{alloy steel}} disc as counterpart on dry sliding wear conditions. The alloy was prepared from pure elements and melted in an electric furnace under argon atmosphere and cast into sand <b>moulds.</b> The cast <b>rods</b> were homogenized, solution heat treated and aged. Specific wear rate and {{coefficient of friction}} were measured in a sliding speed of 191 rpm, 287 rpm and 382 rpm and different normal forces of 10 N, 15 N and 20 N. Hardness of the specimen was found to increase by the aging process and it reached its maximum value, after which it decreased. The specific wear rate was found to increase {{with the increase in}} normal load and it decreased with the increase in speed. Co-efficient of friction is independent of hardness of the alloy and dependent on both applied load and speed. The strength of the material is increased by a technique called spinodal decomposition and aging process. In the case of Cu-Ni-Sn system the various alloy composition was not tested for tribological behaviour. Only few alloy compositions are studied. So in this case we have taken Cu- 11 Ni- 6 Sn alloy composition.

40|$|In recent years, the {{compression}} moulding of E-glass/polypropylene commingled composites has been thoroughly investigated. In particular, in the University of Nottingham, {{a number of}} studies have been carried out, trying to correlate moulding parameters with mechanical properties and microstructural void content. However, some aspects of commingled composites have received less coverage so far and are therefore dealt with in this paper. These concern the effect of the processing conditions of these materials on interlaminar shear strength and impact properties and the influence of the synergy between processing, microstructure and properties on the impact performance of commingled composite structures. With this aim, flat plaques of E-glass/polypropylene commingled composites with a different fibre architecture (two-and three-dimensional) were non-isothermally compression moulded under various moulding conditions and then tested. The test programme included falling weight impact tests with a staircase procedure, Charpy impact tests and interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) tests. To evaluate the consolidation of the laminates, void content measurement using optical microscopy was related to ILSS and impact test results. In particular, the specific issues arising in <b>moulding</b> <b>laminates</b> with added three-dimensional fibres were studied. These include correct placement of the tow, sufficient preheating of thick laminates and nesting of the layers during moulding. The results of these tests are discussed in the light of the moulding conditions and quality, and conclusions are drawn regarding optimum moulding conditions for impact performance. Finally, indications on the reliability and possible improvement of the moulding procedure to yield a sufficient moulding quality, even with large thickness, are also provided. The knowledge acquired on material consolidation properties is applied in the manufacture of an automotive side intrusion beam: problems due to the scale effect are also discussed...|$|R

The methods of segregating veneers quality were defined. The superior veneers were obtained by peeling the billets until their diameters left approximately 12 inches, meanwhile the inferior veneers were obtained by further peeling the same billets used for obtaining superior veneers until their diameters left 4 inches. The mean densities for superior veneer as well as inferior veneer were about 478. 8 kg/m 3 and 385. 1 kg/m 3 respectively.   The mean moisture content of both superior and inferior veneers was approximately 11 %. The veneers were arranged with 5 layers into three types of moulded shapes of furniture components namely i) 100 % S ii) alternate S and I and iii) surface S & core I. The suitable pressure, temperature and time were set as important parameters. The arrangements of veneer quality were pressed using V-shape mould through hot press machine with three parameters pressure 1500 psi, 2000 psi and 2500 psi.

40|$|National audienceWe {{report on}} the primary and {{secondary}} acoustic forces exerted by ultrasonic standing waves on the motion of air bubbles in microfluidic devices. Bubbles are generated in a flow-focusing device and various sizes are obtained by adjusting the air to water plus surfactant flow rates. Ultrasounds are brought in channel through the resonance modes of a glass <b>rod</b> <b>moulded</b> near the channel. A CCD camera is used for optical measurements and to record bubble trajectories. Primary Bjerknes forces cause the very compressible bubbles entering the standing wave region to be deflected and attracted either towards the nodes or the anti-nodes, depending on the relative value of the standing wave frequency and the bubbles resonance. This acoustic force of a few hundreds of nanoNewtons in amplitude {{can be used to}} drive bubbles in a lab-on-a chip device, by a proper choice of the applied frequency, using moderate sound amplitudes of order of 10 kPa. Secondary Bjerknes forces between two or more bubbles oscillating in the main pressure field are seen for large pressure amplitudes and/or when the bubbles come close enough. In this case, we observe superimposed to the primary force an additional effect due to the pressure field radiated from one pulsating bubble acting on the second, that makes them either to agglomerate, or to repulse. Size sorting experiments using this principle will be presented. Last, a new phenomenon has been evidenced for moderate incident field amplitudes that manifests by a self-organisation of the bubbles into a periodic lattice. In order to explain the existence of this bubble crystal that moves independently of the acoustic standing wave, existence parameters (size of the bubbles, acoustic amplitude, frequency) have been systematically investigated, leading to a new phenomenological and theoretical description based on bubble-bubble interactions mediated by acoustic waves...|$|R
