Support and <b>lock</b> <b>brackets</b> for individual bicycles are horizontally disposed fork arrangements formed by two joined U-shaped members. Oppositely extending <b>locking</b> <b>brackets</b> allow pairs of bicycles to be conveniently placed along a series of evenly spaced posts and cross-bars...|$|R

40|$|Solar array {{rotation}} mechanism provides a hinged joint between the solar panel and satellite body, smooth {{rotation of the}} solar array into deployed position and its fixation in this position. After unlocking of solar panel (while in orbit), rotation bracket turns towards ready-to-work position under the action of driving spring. During deployment, once reached the required operating angle (defined by power subsystem engineer), the rotation bracket collides with the fixed bracket that is mounted on body of the satellite, to stop rotation. Due {{to the effect of}} collision force that may alter the {{rotation mechanism}} function, design of centrifugal brake is essential. At stoppage moment micro-switches activate final position sensor and a stopper <b>locks</b> the rotation <b>bracket.</b> Design of spring and centrifugal brake components, static finite element stress analysis of primary structure body of rotation mechanism at stoppage moment have been obtained. Last, reliability analysis of rotation mechanism is evaluated. The benefit {{of this study is to}} aid in the design of rotation mechanism that can be used in micro-satellite applications.

5000|$|The {{test program}} at Goodyear's {{facilities}} near Wingfoot Lake, Akron, Ohio {{showed that the}} inflation could be accomplished with as little as 8 psi (544 mbar), less than a car tire. The flight test program had a fatal crash when Army aviator Lt. [...] "Pug" [...] Wallace was killed. The aircraft was in a descending turn {{when one of the}} control cables under the wing came off the pulley and was wedged in the pulley <b>bracket,</b> <b>locking</b> the stick. The turn tightened until one of the wings folded up over the propellor and was chopped up. With the wings flapping because of loss of air, one of the aluminum wing tip skids hit the pilot alongside the head, as was clear from marks on his helmet. Wallace was pitched out over the nose of the aircraft and fell into the shallow lake. His chute never opened. He may have been knocked unconscious and rendered unable to open it. Only 12 Goodyear Inflatoplanes were built, but development continued until the project was cancelled in 1973.|$|R
2500|$|For {{a variety}} of reasons, many cyclists choose to convert {{freewheel}} bicycles to fixed gear. Frames with horizontal dropouts are straightforward to convert, frames with vertical dropouts less so. One method is to simply replace the rear wheel with a wheel that has a track/fixed hub. Another {{is to use a}} hub designed for use with a threaded multi-speed freewheel. [...] Such a hub only has the normal right-handed threads for the cog and not the reverse threads for the lockrings used on track/fixed hubs. [...] The sprocket on a hub without a lockring may unscrew while back pedalling. Even if a bottom bracket lockring is threaded onto the hub, along with a track sprocket, because the bottom-bracket lockring is not reverse threaded, the possibility still exists that both the sprocket and locknut can unscrew. [...] Therefore, it is recommended to have both front and rear brakes on a fixed-gear bicycle using a converted freewheel hub in case the cog unscrews while back pedaling. It is also advisable to use a thread sealer for the cog and bottom <b>bracket</b> <b>locking.</b> The rotafix (or [...] "frame whipping") method may be helpful to securely install the sprocket.|$|R
