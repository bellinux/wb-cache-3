50|$|Almost all {{attributes}} of a European patent in a Contracting State, i.e. ownership, validity, and infringement, are determined independently under respective national law, {{except for the}} opposition procedure, <b>limitation</b> <b>procedure,</b> and revocation procedure as discussed above. Though the EPC imposes some common limits, the EPC expressly adopts national law for interpretation of all substantive {{attributes of}} a European patent in a Contracting State, with a few exceptions. Thus, almost all post-grant proceedings - including renewal, revocation proceedings (when initiated by somebody else than the proprietor), and infringement enforcement are determined under national law.|$|E
50|$|A {{requester}} may {{request to}} restrict the claims with respect to one or more, but not all, Contracting States. The limitation would then result in claims being different in different Contracting States. This may however only be done in some special cases, one of them being {{in order to avoid}} conflict with national prior rights (a national prior right is a national patent filed before the filing date - or priority date - of the European patent subject to the <b>limitation</b> <b>procedure</b> but published after the filing date - or priority date - of the European patent).|$|E

"Limitation {{proceedings}} {{would enable}} patentees to narrow down the protection conferred by a patent post-grant {{by means of}} a simple, quick and inexpensive administrative procedure. For example, {{it may be necessary to}} limit a granted patent if, because of prior art which was not known during the examination proceedings or prior national rights not taken into account in these proceedings, the extent of the protection conferred is too great. Using the <b>limitation</b> <b>procedure,</b> patent proprietors may themselves reduce the extent of the protection claimed in a manner which is binding, and thus generally preclude disputes over the validity of a patent. Postgrant limitation is also in the public interest, because it limits the protection claimed by the patentee with effect for the general public. This creates legal certainty and facilitates access by competitors to the freely available prior art." ...|$|E
50|$|Until a {{decision}} of the Enlarged Board of Appeal of the EPO of 1994, namely G 9/93 (reverting earlier {{decision of the}} same instance of 1985, namely G 1/84), {{it was possible for}} the proprietor of a European patent to oppose its own patent with the aim of centrally limiting it. Decision G 9/93 however deprived patent proprietors of this opportunity. This means that, after G 9/93, the only possibility for the proprietor of a European patent to voluntarily limit the scope conferred by its patent (e.g. for instance to strengthen the patent in view of some newly discovered prior art documents and/or in advance of envisaged litigation) was to request such limitation at the national level, i.e. before the national patent offices or competent courts of the Contracting States, if permitted. The EPC of 1973 made no provision for a <b>limitation</b> <b>procedure,</b> and a fortiori no provision for centrally limiting a European patent before the EPO after the nine-month period for filing an opposition (nine months as from the date of grant of the European patent).|$|E
30|$|The CMP {{distribution}} has quickly {{grown in}} popularity {{because of its}} ability to model count data in a flexible manner. Methodological developments are vast, including works in distribution theory (Sellers 2012; Sellers and Shmueli 2013; Borges et al. 2014), regression analysis (Sellers and Shmueli 2009; 2010; Sellers and Raim 2016), control chart theory (Sellers 2012; Saghir and Lin 2014 a; 2014 b), stochastic processes (Zhu et al. 2017), and multivariate data analysis (Sellers et al. 2016). The model has further been applied for various data problems including fitting word lengths (Wimmer et al. 1994), modeling online sales (Boatwright et al. 2003; Borle et al. 2006) and customer behavior (Borle et al. 2007), analyzing traffic accident data (Lord et al. 2008), and for use as a disclosure <b>limitation</b> <b>procedure</b> to protect individual privacy (Kadane et al. 2006).

40|$|When data is {{released}} to the public it is important to find the data alteration method with high confidentiality that provides satisfactory data quality. This paper focuses on developing methods of measuring data quality when the distribution of data is unknown but is postulated to be multivariate non-normal. We treat the data util-ity as a problem of evaluating similarities of original data structure to masked data structure. The data utilities we present here are rooted in the cumulative distribute function, clustering and propensity score approaches. When the distribution is de-parted from normal, simulations {{for a wide variety of}} data structures show how these measures can be used for evaluating disclosure <b>limitation</b> <b>procedures...</b>|$|R
40|$|Information {{organizations}} (IOs) {{must provide}} data {{products that are}} both useful and have low risk of confidentiality disclosure. Recognizing that deidentification of data is generally inadequate to protect their confidentiality against attack by a data snooper, concerned IOs can apply disclosure limitation techniques to the original data. Desirably, the resulting restricted data have both high data utility U to users (analytically valid data) and low disclosure risk R (safe data). This article shows {{the promise of the}} R-U confidentiality map, a chart that traces the impact on R and U of changes in the parameters of a disclosure <b>limitation</b> <b>procedure.</b> Theory for the R-U confidentiality map is developed for additive noise applied to univariate data under various scenarios of data snooper attack. These scenarios are predicated on different knowledge states for the data snooper. A demonstration is provided of how to implement the theory for a real database. Through simulation methods, this leads to an empirical R-U confidentiality map. Application is made to data from a National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) survey, th...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The second-order Van-Leer MUSCL schemes are {{actually}} {{one of the most popular}} high order scheme for fluid dynamic computations. In the frame work of the Euler equations, we introduce a new slope <b>limitation</b> <b>procedure</b> to enforce the scheme to preserve the invariant region: namely the positiveness of both density and pressure as soon as the associated first order scheme does it. In addition, we obtain a second-order minimum principle on the specific entropy and second-order entropy inequalities. This new limitation is developed in the general framework of the MUSCL schemes and the choice of the numerical flux functions remains free. The proposed slope limitation can be applied to any change of variables and we do not impose the use of conservative variables in the piecewise linear reconstruction. Several examples are given in the framework of the primitive variables. Numerical 1 D and 2 D results are performed using several finite volume methods. Key words.

40|$|To protect confidentiality, {{statistical}} agencies typically alter data before releasing {{them to the}} public. Ideally, although {{generally not}} done, the agency also provides a way for secondary data analysts to assess the quality of inferences obtained with the released data. Quality measures can help secondary data analysts to identify inaccurate conclusions resulting from the disclosure <b>limitation</b> <b>procedures,</b> as well as have confidence in accurate conclusions. We propose a framework for an interactive, web-based system that analysts can query for measures of inferential quality. As we illustrate, agencies seeking to build such systems must consider the additional disclosure risks from releasing quality measures. We suggest some avenues of research on limiting these risks. ...|$|R
