50|$|Programmers could {{mitigate}} {{these problems}} by using machine code, to an extent, but this in {{itself was a}} tedious process with a rather steep learning curve. So to address these shortcomings Commodore created the Super Expander cartridge. It provided extra BASIC commands to facilitate using graphics and sound on the VIC-20. It also had commands to read the joystick and <b>lightpen,</b> and unlocked the use of function keys.|$|E
5000|$|The {{best known}} art package was perhaps KoalaPainter, {{primarily}} because of its own custom graphics tablet user interface - the KoalaPad. Another popular drawing program for the C64 was Doodle!. A Commodore 64 version of The Print Shop existed, allowing users to generate signs and banners with a printer. [...] "The Newsroom" [...] was a desktop publishing suite. Lightpens and CAD drawing software were also commercially produced, such as the Inkwell <b>Lightpen</b> and related tools.|$|E
50|$|Several of the inputs were {{directly}} wired to specific registers {{in order to}} allow the hardware to do some of the heavy lifting. For example, the light-pen input would directly halt a counter which was started by the start of the vertical sweep of each display refresh, making calculation of where the <b>lightpen</b> was touching the screen little more than a simple divide/remainder operation. Likewise, the motor control relay for the audio cassette tape was controlled by a simple command and could be readily used in numerous control applications.|$|E
50|$|The TRS-80 Model I used three {{identical}} 5-pin DIN connectors for its AC adapter, video output, {{and tape}} recorder, {{making it easy}} to destroy the unit if the plugs were confused. Almost the same could be seen on Soviet Elektronika BK home computers, where four 5-pin DIN connectors were used for tape recorder, B/W video output, RGB video output and AC adapter. The Geneve 9640 uses an 8 pin DIN for its composite video, analog RGB, audio, and +12 V for an RF modulator. On the Colour Genie, three 5-pin DIN connectors were used for the cassette recorder interface, the <b>lightpen</b> interface and the RS232 interface.|$|E
5000|$|According to {{an article}} {{published}} in Sinclair User magazine, Loki was to have a 7 MHz Z80H CPU, a minimum of 128 KiB of RAM and two custom chips providing much enhanced video and audio capabilities compared to the ZX Spectrum, but with a compatibility mode. The video chip, referred to as the [...] "Rasterop" [...] chip, would have blitter-type functionality and three different modes: 512×256 pixels with 16 colours, 256×212 with 256 colours, or 256×212 with 64 colours and two bits per pixel used for [...] "blitter objects". Comprehensive peripheral support was also claimed, including MIDI, <b>lightpen,</b> joystick and floppy disk. A version of the SuperBASIC language from the Sinclair QL was to be provided in place of the old ZX Spectrum BASIC and support for the CP/M operating system was also intended. On top of this, the computer would cost as little as ₤200.|$|E
50|$|Serious Commodore 64 {{business}} users, however, {{were drawn}} to GEOS. Due to its speed, ease of use, and full suite of office applications and utility software, GEOS provided a work environment {{similar to that of}} an early Apple Macintosh. Arguably the best office applications appeared on GEOS because it was graphically advanced and not limited by the Commodore 64's screen area of 40-columns. Being a fully-fledged OS, GEOS brought the arrival of many add-on fonts, accessories, and applications. It also supported most Commodore 64 peripherals and models of third-party printers. KoalaPad and <b>Lightpen</b> users could use GEOS too, which greatly increased the amount of clip art available for the platform. GEOS proved very popular because of low price for the necessary hardware (and of course the capability of the OS). This was {{due in part to the}} aggressive pricing of the Commodore 64 as a games machine and home computer (With rebates, the C64 was going for as little as US$100 at the time). This was in comparison to a typical PC for US$2000 (which required MS-DOS, and another $99 for Windows 1.0) or the venerable Mac 512K Enhanced also $2000.|$|E
50|$|Being {{able to hold}} 14 {{megabytes}} of RAM, which equates to about a three-minute long stereo sample, Series III was the first sampler {{to be able to}} create sounds with 16-bit, 44.1 kilohertz sample files, as well as 16-voice polyphonic patches. Its design, graphics, and editing tools were also improved, such as the addition of a tablet next to the QWERTY keys for the <b>lightpen</b> to point on instead of on the screen; this change was done due to arguments from users regarding arm aches from having to hold the pen on the screen. A enhanced version of the Page R sequencer called Composer, Arranger, Performer, Sequencer, or CAPS, as well as Eventsync, a post-production utility based on SMPTE timecode linking, were also added to the Series III computer. However, while many people were still using CMIs, sales were starting to diminish significantly due to much lower-cost, MIDI-based sequencers and samplers including the Atari ST and Akai's S612, S900 and 1000 samplers in the market. Paine stopped releasing copies of the CMI in the United Kingdom because of this. The Fairlight company was becoming more focused on post-production products, a market Paine had a hard time getting used to, and when HHB Communications Ltd took over distribution for the United Kingdom, they failed to sell any copies.|$|E

The algorithm reduces the dimensionality of the problem by projecting each point into a plane. This plane is presented to the user on a computer graphics console screen. The operator picks a point on the screen with a <b>lightpen</b> and chooses a "direction of movement" to achieve or increase separation, thereby causing an iteration of the algorithm. Each iteration {{is in fact a}} reorientation of the plane into which the data points are projected. Iterations continue until satisfactory separation is achieved. The algorithm is not restricted by the dimensionality of the data, nor are any distributional assumptions required. Results from six case studies indicate that the algorithm is a useful tool for the analysis of multidimensional data. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|Single crystal silicon photoactive devices using a {{low-temperature}} {{thin-film transistor}} (TFT) compatible process were designed and manufactured on bulk silicon and silicon-on-insulator (SOT) substrates at the Semiconductor and Microsystems Fabrication Laboratory (SMFL) at RIT.

The photoactive devices were integrated in active pixel sensor (APS) arrangements to determine feasibility of integration into large-field SOT or Silicon on Glass (SiOG) applications. Currently most APS sensors fabricated using standard bulk silicon processes are incompatible with TFT processing due to temperature constraints; standard TFT processing does not exceed ~ 66 O°C.

40|$|Interest in {{optimized}} human-computer interfaces {{has resulted}} {{in the development of a}} number of interesting devices that allow the computer and human operator to interact through a common drawing surface. These devices include the <b>lightpen,</b> lightgun (Goodwin, 19751, and a variety of touch-sen-sitive display overlay devices. Although touch devices were being investigated as early as 1965 (Orr and Hopkin, circa 19661, behavioral and performance data are scarce in relation to other sources of human-machine interface data. Availability of these devices has increased in the last 10 years and it is now possible to re-trofit such devices to a wide variety of video display terminals at a reasonable cost. With the possibility of increased use looming on the horizon, it would be quite useful to examine the ergo-nomics of such devices and the behavioral adaptation or maladaptation that occurs for each user. Performance data available at this point from previous studies suggests that some positive incre-ments in performance can be expected for graphic-based tasks while no serious decrements should be expected for discrete data entry tasks (Beringer, 1980; Stammers and Bird, 1980). The performance gains expected from this format of interaction are not to be won without som...|$|E

The computer presents displays which instruct the student on-line lo exercise control of the computer system using a Wpewriter or a <b>lightpen</b> located at the console work station. INTRODUCXION The advancing technology of computers brings with it important problems of man-machine com-munication. If computer technology is not to out-strip man’s ability to harness that technology, communication between the man and the machine must improve to permit effective use of the com-puter by novice as well as sophisticated users. For the novice user a computer is often an enig-ma, a formidable array of equipment possessing omnipotence as well as various and changing mystical qualities. Too often he expects the com-puter to be a mindreader. When making com-puters available to novice users, therefore, a basic rule is to keep the man-computer interaction sim-ple, regardless of the complexities of the programs being used. Even a simple interaction must be learned, however, and one approach to the problem is the use of the computer as a teaching aid. If the com-puter presents instructions which the student is generally able to carry out successfully, the first major barrier between man and computer has been hurdled. Learning from the computer how to use the computer positively reinforces the stu-dent. He no longer need fear “the machine. ” The incorporation of computer-aided instmc-tion within a man-computer data processing sys-tem {{is the subject of this}} paper. The computer. based system chosen is AESOP (An Evolutionary System for On-line Processing), a management in-formation control system developed at Th...|$|E
40|$|The work {{presented}} {{is concerned}} with investigations into {{the use of a}} refreshable graphical display for the solution of design and analysis problems in engineering. Effort has been devoted to the study and implementation of a variety of applications in an attempt to identify the most suitable techniques, form of program organization and hardware configuration for this type of equipment. General topics pertinent to these investigations, including data structuring, graphical communication and some general principles of software design, are discussed. The applications which are presented are: (a) LUISA, a system for finite element analysis of two-dimensional engineering structures, (b) TDD, a set of programs for three-dimensional drawing, written to investigate a number of methods of communicating with a three-dimensional model, (c) BAID, a program for aiding the architect with the design of high density housing layouts, (d) An outline of a system for generating the data input for three-dimensional finite element analysis of solid and shell structures. A detailed description is included of a paging scheme used to segment the data structure. The data structure employed and scope of facilities provided are described for each of the applications. Discrete representation of engineering components is shown to be ideally suited to the organization of data in structured form both in the computer core store and on secondary storage. A description is given of some devices, provided by software and making use of the <b>lightpen,</b> which allow development of dynamic techniques for graphical communication with a digital model. A modular approach to software design is advocated, with advantage being taken of general packages, wherever possible, for administration of interaction handling and data organization. Proposals are made about the re-arrangement of the applications dealt with in order to implement them on a remote satellite computer configuration. Suggestions are made about the size of such a configuration and the organization of software in the two machines...|$|E
