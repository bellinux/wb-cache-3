5000|$|<b>Lofexidine</b> {{is not an}} opioid, whereas {{methadone}} is. Some opioid detox programs use methadone in decreasing {{amounts in}} their detox protocol, whereas other detox programs use <b>lofexidine.</b> The drugs are completely chemically unrelated, and their physiological effects are completely unrelated, although both are used {{as part of an}} opioid detoxification protocol. Whereas <b>lofexidine</b> cannot stop opioid withdrawal and merely eases some symptoms of withdrawal, methadone—being an opioid itself—will completely ameliorate all withdrawal symptoms in a sufficient dose. Indeed, one suggested use for <b>lofexidine</b> is to ease withdrawal symptoms of methadone dependence. While abstaining from opiates and taking <b>lofexidine,</b> effective detoxification can succeed in as little as 3 days, although the standard duration of detoxification using <b>lofexidine</b> is 10 days. The [...] of <b>lofexidine</b> is 77 mg/kg. <b>Lofexidine</b> is not currently available in the United States. Britannia Pharmaceuticals has licensed <b>lofexidine</b> to be sold by US World Meds for sale in North America, and clinical trials are currently underway to secure approval for sale in the United States by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). An additional benefit of <b>lofexidine</b> treatment is that it is given as part of an outpatient, or ambulatory regimen, and can be completed without a hospital stay. This reduces costs for both healthcare provider and patient, and keeps specialist hospital beds free for particularly difficult withdrawal cases.|$|E
50|$|In the United Kingdom, the {{hydrochloride}} form, <b>lofexidine</b> HCl, {{has been}} licensed and sold since 1992 for opiate withdrawal relief in tablet form as BritLofex by Britannia Pharmaceuticals. BritLofex is only available by prescription. <b>Lofexidine</b> is also {{commonly used in}} conjunction with the opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone in rapid detoxification cases. When these two drugs are paired, naltrexone is administered to induce an opioid-receptor blockade sending the subject into immediate withdrawal and accelerating the detoxification process, while <b>lofexidine</b> is given to relieve the symptoms associated with the withdrawal including chills, sweating, stomach cramps, muscle pain, and runny nose.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lofexidine</b> is {{structurally}} {{analogous to}} clonidine, another α2 adrenergic receptor agonist used {{for treatment of}} opioid withdrawal symptoms. A comparison of the two structures is shown at right. Both contain an imidazole ring and a 2,6-dichlorinated phenyl ring. The differences in structure are shown in red, while the similarities are in black. In addition to the structural differences, administration of <b>lofexidine</b> in heroin addicts {{has been shown to}} be more effective for a longer duration, with fewer withdrawal symptoms than clonidine even after one day. However, clonidine is often preferred as it is substantially cheaper than <b>lofexidine</b> when purchased with a private (non-NHS) prescription. This factor is exacerbated by the considerable number of and quantities of medications prescribed to alleviate the constellation of withdrawal signs and symptoms. Additionally, clonidine has been shown to significantly lower blood pressure. Therefore, although similar to <b>lofexidine,</b> clonidine is most frequently prescribed to treat high blood pressure.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lofexidine</b> {{inhibits}} {{the release}} of norepinephrine in the central and peripheral nervous system, thereby reducing some of the withdrawal symptoms, but it has no documented effect on drug craving and endogenous opioid levels.|$|E

50|$|Columbia University, in {{collaboration}} with the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), is undertaking a clinical trial that looks at the effects of combined medication on cannabis dependency, to see if <b>lofexidine</b> in combination with dronabinol is superior to placebo in achieving abstinence, reducing cannabis use and reducing withdrawal in cannabis-dependent patients seeking treatment for their marijuana use.

50|$|The driving {{principle}} behind ORT is the program's {{capacity to}} facilitate a resumption of stability in the user's life, while the patient experiences reduced symptoms of drug withdrawal and less intense drug cravings; a strong euphoric effect is not experienced {{as a result of}} the treatment drug. In some countries (not the US, or Australia), regulations enforce a limited time period for people on ORT programs that conclude when a stable economic and psychosocial situation is achieved. (Patients suffering from HIV/AIDS or Hepatitis C are usually excluded from this requirement.) In practice, 40-65% of patients maintain complete abstinence from opioids while receiving opioid replacement therapy and 70-95% are able to reduce their use significantly. Along with this is a concurrent elimination or reduction in medical (improper diluents, non-sterile injecting equipment), psychosocial (mental health, relationships), and legal (arrest and imprisonment) issues that can arise from the use of illegal opioids. Clonidine or <b>lofexidine</b> can help treat the symptoms of withdrawal.|$|E
50|$|Norepinephrine has higher {{affinity}} for the α2 receptor than has epinephrine, and therefore relates less to the latter's functions. Nonselective agonists include the antihypertensive drug clonidine, used to lower blood pressure and hot flashes associated with menopausal symptoms. Clonidine has also been successfully used in indications that exceed what would be expected from a simple blood-pressure lowering drug: it has recently shown positive results in children with ADHD who suffer from tics resulting from the treatment with a CNS stimulant drug, such as Adderall XR or methylphenidate; clonidine also helps alleviate symptoms of opioid withdrawal. The hypotensive effect of clonidine was initially attributed through its agonist action on presynaptic α2 receptors, which act as a down-regulator {{on the amount of}} norepinephrine released in the synaptic cleft, an example of autoreceptor. However, it is now known that clonidine binds to imidazoline receptors with a much greater affinity than α2 receptors, which would account for its applications outside the field of hypertension alone. Imidazoline receptors occur in the nucleus tractus solitarii and also the centrolateral medulla. Clonidine is now thought to decrease blood pressure via this central mechanism. Other nonselective agonists include dexmedetomidine, <b>lofexidine</b> (another antihypertensive), TDIQ (partial agonist), tizanidine (in spasms, cramping) and xylazine. Xylazine has veterinary use.|$|E

40|$|Background: We {{hypothesised}} {{that the}} orally-active 2 -adrenoceptor agonist <b>lofexidine</b> hydrochloride would ameliorate chronic pelvic pain in women. Methods: A randomized placebo-controlled parallel group trial was {{undertaken in the}} University Hospital Gynaecology Clinic. Women with pelvic pain of at least 6 months duration were eligible, and were randomized using a sealed envelope system to receive up to 600 mg <b>lofexidine</b> hydrochloride twice daily over 8 weeks or placebo.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{prompted}} by the growing interest in and demand for non-opiate alternatives to methadone detoxification, such as the 2 -adrenergic agonist <b>lofexidine.</b> <b>Lofexidine</b> acts centrally to suppress the opiate withdrawal syndrome and offers a non-opiate, rapid withdrawal treatment from opiates, without the risk of dependency. The study aims to identify an appropriate alternative model for a Community Detoxification Team for implementation in Clondalkin, an urban area where there are high levels of opiate misuse. The review of the relevant literature provided a conceptual and practical base of knowledge to inform the study. The review found that <b>lofexidine</b> can be used safely in a community stetting and therefore could provide a viable, safe alternative to methadone. Qualitative research techniques were employed to illicit key informants ’ experiences and views of <b>lofexidine</b> detoxification. 20 people participated in two focus groups, while 11 participated in individual semi-structured interviews. Interviews were transcribed and analysis aided {{by the use of}} the Nud*ist 4 software package. The findings of this study support the need for the provision of alternative treatment options to drug misuser. In general, <b>lofexidine</b> was found to be suitable mainly for younger users with a short history of opiate dependence. Motivation, family and social supports together with the availability of counselling were identified as important factors in determining a positive outcome from <b>lofexidine</b> detoxification. The study recommends that a Community Detoxification Team, using <b>lofexidine,</b> be established on a pilot basis. The team should consist of a Co-ordinator, Drugs Worker, Nurse and General Practitioner. It is proposed that the community detoxification programme will take place over a four-week period and an integrated care pathway has been identified.

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comOBJECTIVES: This paper presents the main findings of a systematic (Cochrane) review {{of the effectiveness of}} α 2 -adrenergic agonists in managing opioid withdrawal. DESIGN: The original systematic review included controlled trials that compared α 2 -adrenergic agonists with another form of treatment (or placebo) in participants who were primarily opioid-dependent. MAIN FINDINGS: Ten studies compared a treatment regime based on an α 2 -adrenergic agonist with one based on reducing doses of methadone. Withdrawal intensity is similar to, or marginally greater with α 2 -adrenergic agonists, but signs and symptoms of withdrawal occur and resolve earlier in treatment. Participants stay in treatment longer with methadone. The likelihood of completing withdrawal is similar, or slightly less, with clonidine or <b>lofexidine.</b> Clonidine is associated with more adverse effects than reducing doses of methadone. Three studies compared the α 2 -adrenergic agonists, clonidine and <b>lofexidine.</b> <b>Lofexidine</b> does not reduce blood pressure to the same extent as clonidine, but is otherwise similar to clonidine. CONCLUSIONS: Participants stay in treatment longer with methadone regimes, which may provide greater opportunity for psychosocial intervention. Methadone regimes may be preferable for withdrawal in outpatient settings where the risk of relapse to heroin use is high. The use of methadone may also facilitate transfer to maintenance treatment should completion of withdrawal become unlikely. For those who are well prepared for withdrawal and seeking earlier resolution of withdrawal symptoms, α 2 -adrenergic agonist treatment may be preferred. Clonidine and <b>lofexidine</b> appear equally effective for inpatient settings, but the lower incidence of hypotension makes <b>lofexidine</b> more suited to use in outpatient settings. Linda R.

40|$|Some α-adrenoceptor-mediated {{cardiovascular}} {{activities and}} α-adrenoceptor binding affinities for (+) - and (-) -lofexidine (Dexlofexidine and Levlofexidine) {{have been studied}} in comparison with racemic <b>lofexidine.</b> In pithed normotensive rats, i. v. (-) -lofexidine elicited pressor effects at doses (0. 1 - 30 μg/kg), which were approximately 20 times {{lower than those of}} the (+) -isomer. Both yohimbine and prazosin in selective amounts of 1. 0 and 0. 1 mg/kg (i. v., - 15 min), respectively, attenuated the increase in diastolic pressure induced by (±) -, (+) - and (-) -lofexidine, showing the involvement of α 1 - as well as α 2 -adrenoceptors in the vasopressor responses. No differences were observed in the sensitivity of the pressor effects of the (+) - and (-) -enantiomers to blockade by either yohimbine or prazosin. Following i. v. administration to pentobarbitone-anaesthetized normotensive rats, (-) -lofexidine (0. 5 - 5. 0 μg/kg) was found about 20 times more effective than the dextrorotatory isomer in decreasing mean arterial pressure and heart rate. The increase in heart rate evoked by electrical stimulation in pithed rats was dose-dependently reduced by (±) -, (-) - and (+) -lofexidine, the (-) -isomer being about 30 times more potent than the (+) -isomer. Similarly, the electrical stimulation-induced increase in diastolic pressure was also most effectively impaired by the laevorotatory enantiomer of <b>lofexidine.</b> (-) -Lofexidine showed an approximately 9 -fold higher affinity than (+) -lofexidine for the α 2 -adrenoceptor-like binding sites in rat brain membranes identified by [3 H]-clonidine and was 4 times more potent at displacing [3 H]-prazosin from α 1 -adrenoceptors. It is concluded that the α-adrenoceptor activity of <b>lofexidine</b> resides predominantly in the (-) -isomer.

Thirteen studies compared a treatment regime based on an alpha 2 -adrenergic agonist with one based on reducing doses of methadone. Diversity in study design, assessment and reporting of outcomes limited the extent of quantitative analysis. Alpha 2 -adrenergic agonists are more effective than placebo in ameliorating withdrawal, and despite higher rates of adverse effects, are associated with significantly higher rates of completion of treatment. For the comparison of alpha 2 -adrenergic agonist regimes with reducing doses of methadone, there were insufficient data for statistical analysis, but withdrawal intensity appears similar to or marginally greater with alpha 2 -adrenergic agonists, while signs and symptoms of withdrawal occur and resolve earlier.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review {{summarizes}} {{current research}} on the management of opioid withdrawal and considers {{the selection of the}} approach in different situations. RECENT FINDINGS: The recent publication of three controlled trials makes firm conclusions about the relative effectiveness of newer approaches (antagonist-induced withdrawal under anaesthesia or with minimal sedation; buprenorphine) to the management of opioid withdrawal possible. SUMMARY: Antagonist-induced withdrawal under anaesthesia should not be pursued as it has an increased risk of life-threatening adverse events and has no additional benefits relative to antagonist-induced withdrawal under minimal sedation. Antagonist-induced withdrawal with minimal sedation is feasible and may be suitable for those who intend to enter antagonist-maintenance treatment with a clear commitment to abstinence and good support. Buprenorphine is suitable for quick withdrawal, supports transition to naltrexone maintenance treatment, is safe and effective in outpatient settings and can be extended into maintenance treatment if the detoxification attempt is unsuccessful. Adrenergic agonists (clonidine and <b>lofexidine)</b> remain an effective option {{for those who do not}} want to use an opioid and do not intend to transfer to naltrexone maintenance treatment, with <b>lofexidine</b> being preferable for outpatient settings.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of interventions involving the use of alpha 2 -adrenergic agonists compared with placebo, reducing doses of methadone, symptomatic medications or with comparison of different alpha 2 -adrenergic agonists, {{for the management of}} the acute phase of opioid withdrawal. Outcomes included the intensity of signs and symptoms and overall withdrawal syndrome experienced, duration of treatment, occurrence of adverse effects and completion of treatment. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 7, 2013), MEDLINE (1946 to July week 4, 2013), EMBASE (January 1985 to August week 1, 2013), PsycINFO (1806 to July week 5, 2013) and reference lists of articles. We also contacted manufacturers in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing alpha 2 -adrenergic agonists (clonidine, <b>lofexidine,</b> guanfacine, tizanidine) with reducing doses of methadone, symptomatic medications or placebo, or comparing different alpha 2 -adrenergic agonists to modify the signs and symptoms of withdrawal in participants who were opioid dependent. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One review author assessed studies for inclusion and undertook data extraction. All review authors decided on inclusion and confirmed the overall process. MAIN RESULTS: We included 25 randomised controlled trials, involving 1668 participants. Five studies compared a treatment regimen based on an alpha 2 -adrenergic agonist with placebo, 12 with a regimen based on reducing doses of methadone, four with symptomatic medications and five compared different alpha 2 -adrenergic agonists. Alpha 2 -adrenergic agonists were more effective than placebo in ameliorating withdrawal in terms of the likelihood of severe withdrawal (risk ratio (RR) 0. 32, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 18 to 0. 57, 3 studies, 148 participants). Completion of treatment was significantly more likely with alpha 2 -adrenergic agonists compared with placebo (RR 1. 95, 95 % CI 1. 34 to 2. 84, 3 studies, 148 participants). Alpha 2 -adrenergic agonists were somewhat less effective than reducing doses of methadone in ameliorating withdrawal symptoms, as measured by the likelihood of severe withdrawal (RR 1. 18, 95 % CI 0. 81 to 1. 73, 5 studies, 340 participants), peak withdrawal score (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0. 22, 95 % CI - 0. 02 to 0. 46, 2 studies, 263 participants) and overall withdrawal severity (SMD 0. 13, 95 % CI - 0. 24 to 0. 49, 3 studies, 119 participants). These differences were not statistically significant. The signs and symptoms of withdrawal occurred and resolved earlier with alpha 2 -adrenergic agonists. The duration of treatment was significantly longer with reducing doses of methadone (SMD - 1. 07, 95 % CI - 1. 31 to - 0. 83, 3 studies, 310 participants). Hypotensive or other adverse effects were significantly more likely with alpha 2 -adrenergic agonists (RR 1. 92, 95 % CI 1. 19 to 3. 10, 6 studies, 464 participants) but {{there was no significant difference}} in rates of completion of withdrawal treatment (RR 0. 85, 95 % CI 0. 69 to 1. 05, 9 studies, 659 participants). There were insufficient data for quantitative comparison of different alpha 2 -adrenergic agonists.

40|$|Buprenorphine/naloxone, {{methadone}} and <b>lofexidine</b> are medications with {{utility in}} the treatment of opiate withdrawal. We report the first randomised controlled trial to compare the effects of these two medications on withdrawal symptoms and outcome during opiate induction/stabilisation and detoxification. A double-blind randomised controlled trial was conducted in an outpatient satellite clinic of a specialist drug service. Eighty opiate dependent individuals meeting DSM-IV criteria for opiate dependence, using ⩽ ½ g heroin smoked/chased or ¼ g heroin injected or ⩽ 30 mg methadone, with ⩽ 3 years of opioid dependency, underwent a short-term opiate treatment programme involving induction/stabilisation on methadone 30 mg or buprenorphine/naloxone 4 mg/ 1 mg, followed by detoxification (where the methadone group was assisted by <b>lofexidine).</b> The main outcome measures were urine drug screens for opiates and withdrawal and craving questionnaires. There were no overall differences in positive urine drug screens and drop-outs during any phase of the study.

40|$|Managed {{withdrawal}} is {{a necessary}} step prior to drug-free treatment or as the end point of substitution treatment. To assess the effectiveness of interventions involving the use of buprenorphine to manage opioid withdrawal, for withdrawal signs and symptoms, completion of withdrawal and adverse effects. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2008), MEDLINE (January 1966 to July 2008), EMBASE (January 1985 to 2008 Week 31), PsycINFO (1967 to 7 August 2008) and reference lists of articles. Randomised controlled trials of interventions involving the use of buprenorphine to modify the {{signs and symptoms of}} withdrawal in participants who were primarily opioid dependent. Comparison interventions involved reducing doses of methadone, alpha(2) -adrenergic agonists, symptomatic medications or placebo, or different buprenorphine-based regimes. One author assessed studies for inclusion and methodological quality, and undertook data extraction. Inclusion decisions and the overall process was confirmed by consultation between all authors. Twenty-two studies involving 1736 participants were included. The major comparisons were with methadone (5 studies) and clonidine or <b>lofexidine</b> (12 studies). Five studies compared different rates of buprenorphine dose reduction. Severity of withdrawal is similar for withdrawal managed with buprenorphine and withdrawal managed with methadone, but withdrawal symptoms may resolve more quickly with buprenorphine. It appears that completion of withdrawal treatment may be more likely with buprenorphine relative to methadone (RR 1. 18; 95 % CI 0. 93 to 1. 49, P = 0. 18) but more studies are required to confirm this. Relative to clonidine or <b>lofexidine,</b> buprenorphine is more effective in ameliorating the symptoms of withdrawal, patients treated with buprenorphine stay in treatment for longer (SMD 0. 92, 95 % CI 0. 57 to 1. 27, P < 0. 001), {{and are more likely to}} complete withdrawal treatment (RR 1. 64; 95 % CI 1. 31 to 2. 06, P < 0. 001). At the same time there is no significant difference in the incidence of adverse effects, but drop-out due to adverse effects may be more likely with clonidine. Buprenorphine is more effective than clonidine or <b>lofexidine</b> for the management of opioid withdrawal. Buprenorphine may offer some advantages over methadone, at least in inpatient settings, in terms of quicker resolution of withdrawal symptoms and possibly slightly higher rates of completion of withdrawal.

In addition, two recently approved formulations of previously proven medications are in early phases of implementation. The sublingual film form of buprenorphine + naloxone (Suboxone&reg;) provides a less divertible, more quickly administered, more child-proof version than the buprenorphine + naloxone sublingual tablet. The injectable depot form of naltrexone (Vivitrol&reg;) ensures consistent opioid receptor blockade for one month between administrations, removing concerns about medication compliance. The clinical implications of these developments have attracted increasing attention from clinicians and policymakers in the US and around the world, especially given that human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and other infectious diseases are recognized as companions to opioid addiction, commanding more efforts to reduce opioid addiction.

40|$|The {{successor}} to Strain and Stitzer's Methadone Treatment for Opioid Dependence (Johns Hopkins, 1999), this expanded and updated volume reflects {{new developments in}} treatment protocols. Methadone {{is still the most}} widely used medication for the treatment of opioid dependence, and the authors provide an extensive section on methadone treatment. Three chapters cover the pharmacology and clinical use of buprenorphine as well as the latest research on Naltrexone, Clonidine, and <b>Lofexidine.</b> The volume also includes chapters on pain and prescription opioids as well as medication-free treatment and medically supervised alternatives to opioid substitute treatments, including withdrawal. The Treatment of Opioid Dependence will be a valuable resource for methadone counselors, psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, mental health nurses, and addiction counselors, as well as physicians interested in office-based buprenorphine treatment...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{numerous}} effective pharmacologic and behav-ioral therapies {{are available}} {{for the treatment of}} opioid ad-diction, and these two types of therapies often are combined to optimize patient management. Newer therapeutic op-tions may take various forms. For example, methadone maintenance is an established treatment modality, whereas the use of buprenorphine and naloxone in an office-based setting represents a new variation on that theme. Clonidine has been used extensively to ameliorate opioid withdrawal signs, whereas <b>lofexidine</b> is a structural analogue that ap-pears to have less hypotensive and sedating effects. The depot dosage form of naltrexone, currently under develop-ment, may increase compliance with a medication that has been an effective opioid antagonist but that has been un-derused secondary to patient nonacceptance. In almost every treatment episode using pharmacotherapy, it is com-bined with some type of psychosocial or behavioral treat-ment. Recent research has documented the value of these additional treatments and has provided insight into the ones that are the most effective. This chapter reviews current and experimental treatments for opioid addiction with an emphasis on some of the newer, more promising, and inter-esting therapies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Heroin is a {{synthetic}} opioid with an extensive illicit market leading to {{large numbers of}} people becoming addicted. Heroin users often present to community treatment services requesting detoxification and in the UK various agents are used to control symptoms of withdrawal. Dissatisfaction with methadone detoxification 8 has lead to the use of clonidine, <b>lofexidine,</b> buprenorphine and dihydrocodeine; however, there remains limited evaluative research. In Leeds, a city of 700, 000 people in the North of England, dihydrocodeine is the detoxification agent of choice. Sublingual buprenorphine, however, is being introduced. The comparative value of these two drugs for helping people successfully and comfortably withdraw from heroin has never been compared in a randomised trial. Additionally, there is a paucity of research evaluating interventions among drug users in the primary care setting. This study seeks to address this by randomising drug users presenting in primary care to receive either dihydrocodeine or buprenorphine. Methods/design The Leeds Evaluation of Efficacy of Detoxification Study (LEEDS) project is a pragmatic randomised trial which will compare the open use of buprenorphine with dihydrocodeine for illicit opiate detoxification, in the UK primary care setting. The LEEDS project will involve consenting adults and will be run in specialist general practice surgeries throughout Leeds. The primary outcome will be the results of a urine opiate screening {{at the end of the}} detoxification regimen. Adverse effects and limited data to three and six months will be acquired. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{wide range}} of {{commonly}} abused drugs have effects on the noradrenergic neurotransmitter system, including alterations during acute intoxication and chronic use of these drugs. It is not established, however, that individual differences in noradrenergic signaling, which may be present prior to use of drugs, predispose certain persons to substance abuse. This paper puts forth the novel hypothesis that elevated noradrenergic signaling, which may be raised largely due to genetics but also due to environmental factors, is an etiological factor in the abuse of a {{wide range of}} substances, including alcohol, nicotine, marijuana, heroin, cocaine, and caffeine. Data are reviewed for each of these drugs comprising their interaction with norepinephrine during acute intoxication, long-term use, subsequent withdrawal, and stress-induced relapse. In general, the data suggest that these drugs acutely boost noradrenergic signaling, whereas long-term use also affects this neurotransmitter system, possibly suppressing it. During acute withdrawal after chronic drug use, noradrenergic signaling tends to be elevated, consistent with the observation that norepinephrine lowering drugs such as clonidine reduce withdrawal symptoms. Since psychological stress can promote relapse of drug seeking in susceptible individuals and stress produces elevated norepinephrine release, this suggests that these drugs may be suppressing noradrenergic signaling during chronic use or instead elevating it only in reward circuits of the brain. If elevated noradrenergic signaling is an etiological factor in the abuse of a broad range of substances, then chronic use of pharmacological agents that reduce noradrenergic signaling, such as clonidine, guanfacine, <b>lofexidine,</b> propranolol, or prazosin, may help prevent or treat drug abuse in general...|$|E
40|$|Opioid addiction, {{termed a}} “chronic, {{relapsing}} disease”, {{is associated with}} a myriad of health and social problems and its management is an extremely important area of research. alpha- 2 -Adrenoreceptors (alpha- 2 -ARs), belonging to the superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors, have been demonstrated to be extremely sensitive to opioid exposure and to {{play a key role in}} opiate withdrawal symptoms. In detoxification alpha- 2 -AR agonists, such as clonidine and <b>lofexidine,</b> are often clinically used to reduce the intensity of withdrawal symptoms. However, the activation of the alpha- 2 A-AR subtype, triggered by these compounds, is responsible for evoked sedation and hypotension side effects. Therefore, selective alpha- 2 C-AR agonists, devoid of the side effects induced by the alpha- 2 A-AR stimulation, alone or in combination with opioids might represent an improvement over current therapies with clonidine-like drugs. Interestingly, depending on their preferred extended molecular conformation, allyphenyline (1) and its analogue cyclomethyline (2) behave as alpha- 2 C-AR agonists/alpha- 2 A-AR antagonists. 1 Due to such a biological profile, 12 and 2 prove to be devoid of sedative effect as well as to prevent and contrast morphine dependence at very low dose (0. 05 mg/Kg) in mice. Elevate comorbidity between opioid addiction and depression emerges from several clinical studies. It is noteworthy that, unlike the clinically used clonidine, 1 and 2 are able to provide alone and at the same low dose (0. 05 mg/Kg) both improvement of morphine withdrawal symptoms and potent antidepressant-like effect. The study of the enantiomers of 1 and 2 highlights that the antidepressant response {{is associated with a}}n additional 5 -HT 1 A receptor (5 -HT 1 A-R) activation. 1 and 2 display favourable in vitro ADME profiles and negligible activity on the hERG channel...|$|E
40|$|The physical, {{psychological}} and social implications of opiate dependency are well known. A variety of treatment approaches, including behavioural therapy, social skills and stress management have been used. The pharmacotherapeutic approach, using methadone maintenance therapy, has proved most beneficial to date and is the mainstay of treatment in the Irish setting. A systematic review was undertaken in order to evaluate the potential usefulness of buprenorphine as an intervention {{in the treatment of}} opiate dependency. All available data were retrieved by means of a comprehensive search of the published literature and clinical trials databases. Authors of pivotal studies were contacted for further information, for inclusion in a meta analysis. Contact was made with experts in the UK and France, to evaluate the practical issues associated with buprenorphine in a clinical setting. Pharmacoeconomic data were retrieved from the GMS, ERHA and the manufacturer for the purposes of analysis. The results of the clinical trials evaluation showed that buprenorphine appeared to have potential in the management of opiate dependence. It was shown to be at least as effective as other treatment regimens (clonidine and <b>lofexidine)</b> in treating managed opiate withdrawal (detoxification). Buprenorphine (at doses of > 8 mg/day) was as effective as methadone as a maintenance treatment option. It was not possible to define the optimal dosage regimen for either indication, but treatment appeared to be most effective when dosage was titrated to the individual's needs. Because of its pharmacological profile, less than daily dosing (e. g. thrice weekly) is a possible dosing option. Evaluation of its use in clinical practice showed that it was considered as effective as methadone for maintenance treatment, had a better safety profile but had more abuse potential. Accordingly, supervised dispensing was recommended by many experts, especially in the early months of treatment. Experience of its use in managed opiate withdrawal was more limited but was also favourable. The review suggests that buprenorphine may be viewed as an effective treatment option in the management of opiate dependence syndrome, with an acceptable safety profile...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of tapered methadone compared with other detoxification treatments and placebo in managing opioid withdrawal on completion of detoxification and relapse rate. Abuse of opioid drugs and dependence on them causes major health and social issues that include transmission of HIV and hepatitis C with injection, increased crime and costs for health care and law enforcement, family disruption and lost productivity. Addicts, particularly those aged 15 to 34 years, are also at higher risk of death. Managed withdrawal (or detoxification) is used as the first step in treatment. Withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, chills, muscle pain (myalgia) and weakness, tremor, lethargy and drowsiness, restlessness and irritability, nausea and vomiting and diarrhoea. Persisting sleep disturbances and drug craving can continue for weeks and months after detoxification and often lead to a return to opioid use. The number of addicts who complete detoxification tends to be low, and rates of relapse are high. For a tapered dose treatment to reduce withdrawal symptoms, illicit opioids are replaced by methadone or another agent using decreasing doses up to 30 days under medical supervision. The review authors searched the medical literature and identified 23 controlled trials involving 2467 adult opioid users in various countries. Trial participants were randomised to receive methadone or another pharmacological treatment. The other treatments were adrenergic agonists such as <b>lofexidine,</b> partial opioid agonists such as buprenorphine, opioid agonists such as LAAM (levo-α-acetyl-methadol) and the anxiolytics chlordiazepoxide and buspirone. In the two studies that compared methadone with placebo, withdrawal symptoms were more severe and more people dropped out in the placebo group. The studies included in this review confirmed that slow tapering with temporary substitution of long- acting opioids, could reduce withdrawal severity. Nevertheless, the majority of patients relapsed to heroin use. The medications used in the included studies were similar in terms of overall effectiveness, although symptoms experienced by participants differed according to the medication used and the program adopted. The programs varied widely with regard to the assessment of outcome measures. Seventeen of the included trials were conducted in inpatient settings...|$|E
40|$|Naloxone (NX) potentiated {{epinephrine}} (EPI) induced submaximal vasoconstriction in canine renal and {{skeletal muscle}} arterial segments, yet had no vasoconstrictor action alone. Developed tension generated in-vitro by 4 x 1 mm. O. D. rings from 1 st degree branches of canine femoral arteries was expressed as % of KCI induced maximum response. NX (10 ^- 5 M) potentiated EPI induced submaximal contractions (34. 2 %) {{significantly more than}} contractions induced by norepinephrine, phenylephrine, <b>lofexidine,</b> ADH, KCI and serotonin (13. 8, 13. 4, 4. 7, 13. 5, 14. 4 and 11. 4 % respectively). The NX response was unaffected by beta-adrenergic blockade and NX did not reverse an isoproterenol mediated vasodilation. Alphaadrenergic blockade with phentolamine completely eliminated EPI plus NX induced vasoconstriction. After washout, vessels exposed to EPI plus NX relaxed by 50 % significantly faster than vessels exposed to EPI alone (18. 5 and 27. 9 min respectively). EPI induced vasoconstrictions were potentiated by 10 ^- 5 M corticosterone (49. 0 %) which inhibits extraneuronal catecholamine uptake, but not by 10 ^- 7 M desipramine (1. 1 %) which inhibits neuronal uptake. EPI induced vasoconstrictions were also potentiated by 10 ^- 4 M pyrogallol (33. 0 %) which inhibits catechol-o-methyl transferase activity, but not by 10 ^- 5 M pargyline (- 1. 1 %) which inhibits monoamine oxidase activity. The NX effect was endothelium independent. The dose-response of various opioid receptor agonists and antagonists were compared to the NX response. A specific opioid receptor subclass could not be identified as the mediator of the NX effect. The ED_ 50 s for NX (3. 7 x^- 6 M) and (+) NX (8. 1 x^- 7 M) indicated a significant stereoselectivity for the (+) enantiomer. A variety of sigma receptor ligands, steroids and steroid metabolites were {{tested for the ability}} to augment EPI vasoconstrictions. Several of the opioid, sigma and steroid ligands, all with polycyclic structures, induced responses similarto those of NX. NX exerted its effect independent of traditional opiate receptors and may have influenced the cellular uptake or degradation of EPI. Endogenous compounds with sigma or steroid activity may modulate these processes in-vivo...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Managed {{withdrawal}} {{is necessary}} prior to drug-free treatment. It may also represent the end point of long-term opioid replacement treatment. OBJECTIVES: To assess {{the effectiveness of}} opioid antagonists in combination with minimal sedation to induce withdrawal, in terms of intensity of withdrawal, adverse effects and completion of treatment. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2005, which includes the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group register), MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2005), EMBASE (January 1985 to August 2005), PsycINFO (1967 to August 2005), and CINAHL (1982 to July 2005) and reference lists of articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Experimental interventions involved the use of opioid antagonists in combination with minimal sedation to manage withdrawal in opioid-dependent participants compared with other approaches or different opioid antagonist regime. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One reviewer assessed studies for inclusion and undertook data extraction and trial quality. Study authors were contacted for additional information. MAIN RESULTS: Nine studies (5 randomised controlled trials), involving 775 participants, met the inclusion criteria for the review. Withdrawal induced by opioid antagonists in combination with an adrenergic agonist is more intense than withdrawal managed with clonidine or <b>lofexidine</b> alone, but the overall severity is less. Limited data showed that antagonist-induced withdrawal may be more severe when the last opioid used was methadone rather than heroin or another short-acting opioid. Delirium may occur following the first dose of opioid antagonist, particularly with higher doses (> 25 mg naltrexone). The studies included suggest {{there is no significant}} difference in rates of completion of treatment for withdrawal induced by opioid antagonists, in combination with an adrenergic agonist, compared with adrenergic agonist alone. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The use of opioid antagonists combined with alpha 2 adrenergic agonists is a feasible approach to the management of opioid withdrawal. However, it is unclear whether this approach reduces the duration of withdrawal or facilitates transfer to naltrexone treatment {{to a greater extent than}} withdrawal managed primarily with an adrenergic agonist. A high level of monitoring and support is desirable for several hours following administration of opioid antagonists because of the possibility of vomiting, diarrhoea and delirium. Further research is required to confirm the relative effectiveness of antagonist-induced regimes, as well as variables influencing the severity of withdrawal, adverse effects, the most effective antagonist-based treatment regime, and approaches that might increase retention in subsequent naltrexone maintenance treatment...|$|E
