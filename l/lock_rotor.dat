40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to design identification methods for identifying a permanent magnet synchronous motor. The whole identification and motor control is carried out in d-q coordinates, and the program used for processing and control was the matlab simulink, together with the real time platform DSpace. The work focuses on two main areas of identification, off-line identification and on-line identification. For offline identification the frequency analysis was used with the <b>lock</b> <b>rotor</b> test to get three main parameters. They are the quadrature and direct inductances and stator resistance. In the online mode, the identified parameters were extended to magnet flux _f identified by MRAS method. The remaining parameters were again identified by frequency analysis, which was adapted into online mode, and simultaneously applied to the identification of several part in one time. The next method is Newton method, which is used for estimating stator resistance of the motor, without the need to apply any signal...|$|E

40|$|<b>Locked</b> <b>rotor</b> and “short circuit at the stator terminals” are two {{standard}} motor {{tests that}} provide operators with useful {{data about the}} electro-mechanical performance of rotating machines for installation. A programme of motor tests was performed on a novel machine with an HTS rotor winding and a conventional copper wound stator. The rotor winding was cooled down to 77 K. The differences when driving 0 and 190 A in the stator winding whilst ramping the field current in the <b>locked</b> <b>rotor</b> close to its critical current are discussed by interpreting small changes in the voltages measured at different locations in the winding. The perpendicular field generated by the stator produced {{the greatest impact on}} the HTS winding and its starting torque.

When the armature is not turning (called <b>locked</b> <b>rotor)</b> there is no Back-EMF and the motor's current draw is quite high. If the motor's starting current is high enough it will pull the line voltage down enough to notice the dimming of the light.|$|R

Unlike conventional characterization methods, where the <b>rotor</b> is <b>locked</b> {{at a fixed}} position, the current injection based method maintains the phase current constant while the machine is run at constant speed. The proposed constant current injection scheme yields the partial derivatives of the flux linkage characteristics directly, which can then be used in SRM controllers.

From this test, short circuit current at normal voltage, power factor on short circuit, total leakage reactance, and starting torque of the motor can be found. The test {{is conducted}} at low voltage because if the applied voltage was normal voltage then the current through the stator windings would be high enough to overheat the windings and damage them. The blocked rotor torque test is not performed on wound-rotor motors because the starting torque can be varied as desired. However, a blocked rotor current test is conducted on squirrel cage rotor motors.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe PWM-supplied {{permanent}} magnet synchronous machines {{are exposed to}} magnets' heating due to harmonic fields which rotate in relation to rotor. The corresponding losses can be calculated by FE simulation for each frequency, with superposition of all components of the losses. In certain conditions three dimensional modelling is required to get enough precision. However, time-stepping 3 D finite element methods coupled with motion equations can lead to excessive computational time. Then a <b>locked</b> <b>rotor</b> approach with current sheet rotating may be interesting. In this case however, the superposition doesn't really work unless special procedure is applied. Magnetic loss dissipation cannot be correctly calculated with simple superposition of individual fields, e. g. the 5 th and 7 th harmonic rotating in opposite direction. This is because the resulting field has an alternative component with dissipative effects depending on its position. They will be more important if the component oscillates {{in the middle of}} magnets and less important in the middle of gap between them...|$|R

40|$|Abstract An Investigation was {{conducted}} to determine electrical behavior when a dc-to-frame ground fault occurs on the secondary side of au AC/DC shuffle car which utilizes an auto-transformer fed SCR package and an SCR drive for the traction motors. Ten different ground wire devices from five manufacturers and eight sizes of neutral ground resistors were used during testing.

40|$|Purpose - The paper {{deals with}} the {{experimental}} validations of the corrective coefficient used {{to take into account}} the skin effect in the equivalent circuit rotor resistance of induction motors with squirrel cages. Design/methodology/approach - <b>Locked</b> <b>rotor</b> tests have been performed at several supply frequencies on different induction motors; the collected experimental data have been used to validate the rotor parameters analytical estimation obtained by means of a numerical procedure previously proposed by the authors. Findings - The reported analyses regard both open and closed rotor slots. For frequencies up to 80 - 100 ?Hz, the reported comparison between experimental and calculated skin effect corrective coefficients shows that the adopted model allows to get satisfactory results in terms of accuracy, lower than 3 percent for open rotor slot machines. The upper frequency limit has to be judged taking into account the objective difficulties to estimate accurate values of the rotor parameters from experimental tests. Practical implications - The proposed algorithm can be easily implemented and added to self-made induction motor design software tools. Originality/value - The proposed procedure allows the computation of the skin effect in induction motor squirrel cage without the use of finite element method approache...|$|R
40|$|As {{commonly}} used forced convection air cooling devices in electronics, cooling fans are crucial for guaranteeing {{the reliability of}} electronic systems. In a cooling fan assembly, fan bearing failure is a major failure mode that causes excessive vibration, noise, reduction in rotation speed, <b>locked</b> <b>rotor,</b> failure to start, and other problems; therefore, {{it is necessary to}} conduct research on the health assessment of cooling fan bearings. This paper presents a vibration-based fan bearing health evaluation method using comblet filtering and exponentially weighted moving average. A new health condition indicator (HCI) for fan bearing degradation assessment is proposed. In order to collect the vibration data for validation of the proposed method, a cooling fan accelerated life test was conducted to simulate the lubricant starvation of fan bearings. A comparison between the proposed method and methods in previous studies (i. e., root mean square, kurtosis, and fault growth parameter) was carried out to assess the performance of the HCI. The analysis results suggest that the HCI can identify incipient fan bearing failures and describe the bearing degradation process.

This has been necessitated by the strong effects that the non linear loads have on power system characteristics and therefore erroneous modeling of these devices {{continues to be an}} area of greater uncertainty. Though various methods of aggregations have been used, comparison on their suitablity and accuracy has not been extensively explored. Also investigated is the suitability of multi-band power system stabilizer (MB-PSS) on the aggregate motor under a fault. The accuracy of these methods is compared to dentify the most appropriate.

The braking performance using both AC and DC supplies is compared. A mathematical model is developed to predict both the transient and steady-state zero-sequence braking performance. To ensure accurate calculations, a model is constructed {{to allow for the}} variation of secondary parameters with frequency due to the skin effect. A method for determining the zero-sequence parameters using <b>locked</b> <b>rotor</b> variable frequency data is presented. To measure the transient acceleration torque of the machine, a rotational accelerometer is developed from a small single-phase induction motor. Good correlation between measured and calculated results is achieved during switching transients for both current and torque. The zero-sequence braking performance is analysed quantitatively and found to be an attractive alternative. When an AC zero-sequence supply is used, braking is suited to situations where it is not essential to brake to a standstill and minimising cost is an important consideration.
