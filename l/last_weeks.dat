5|$|From May 1945 No.75 Squadron {{participated in}} the Borneo Campaign. While the squadron's ground crew landed on Tarakan with the {{invasion}} force in early May 1945, delays with repairing the island's airfield meant that its aircraft could not be deployed there until mid-July rather than 3May as had been originally planned. During this period No.75 Squadron's pilots remained at Morotai but conducted little flying, causing their morale to decline. Once established at Tarakan the Kittyhawks attacked targets near Sandakan and supported Australian forces during the Battle of Balikpapan in the war's <b>last</b> <b>weeks.</b>|$|E

5|$|Schubert {{had been}} {{struggling}} with syphilis since 1822–23, and suffered from weakness, headaches and dizziness.

At this stage he moved from the Vienna home of his friend Franz von Schober to his brother Ferdinand's house in the suburbs, following the advice of his doctor; unfortunately, this may have actually worsened his condition. However, up until the <b>last</b> <b>weeks</b> of his life in November 1828, he continued to compose an extraordinary amount of music, including such masterpieces as the three last sonatas.|$|E

5|$|Three {{days later}} Edwards likely killed Günter Steinhausen, {{a friend of}} Marseille. The next day, 7 September 1942, another close friend Hans-Arnold Stahlschmidt was posted missing in action. These {{personal}} losses weighed heavily on Marseille's mind along with his family tragedy. It was noted he barely spoke and became more morose in the <b>last</b> <b>weeks</b> of his life. The strain of combat also induced consistent sleepwalking at night and other symptoms that {{could be construed as}} posttraumatic stress disorder. Marseille never remembered these events.|$|E
5|$|While U.S. {{support for}} China {{was a reason}} for the war, the U.S. Army did not deploy major ground forces there, {{although}} U.S. air and service units played a vital role. After being driven out of Burma in 1942, a provisional regiment of the U.S. Army (Merrill's Marauders) participated in the reconquest of Northern Burma in 1944, and two regiments took part in the Central Burma Campaign the following year before moving on into China. In response to U.S. Army Air Forces operations from China, the Japanese drove the Americans and Chinese from eastern China. Only in the <b>last</b> <b>weeks</b> of the war did the tide turn in favor of the Allies in China.|$|E

40|$|Background: To analyse the {{prevalence}} of seizures and use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in the end-of-life (EOL) phase of patients with high-grade glioma (HGG) and to identify patient characteristics associated with the occurrence of seizures in the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> of life. Methods: Patients were recruited from a cohort of adults with HGG diagnosed in 2005 and 2006 in three tertiary referral centres for patients with brain tumour. Physicians involved in the EOL care of patients who had HGG and had died were asked to fill in a questionnaire regarding seizures and antiepileptic treatment in the last 3 months and in the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> of life. Data on seizures and use of AEDs before the EOL phase were obtained from medical correspondence and hospital medical charts. Results: Out of 155 patients who had died, data for 92 patients were eligible for analysis. Twenty-nine percent of these 92 patients had seizures during the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> of life; 33 % of patients {{had a history of}} seizures and 22 % did not. Besides a history of status epilepticus (p= 0. 047), we identified no other significant risk factors for developing seizures in the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> of life. Seventy percent of all patients used AEDs before the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> of life. In 35 % of patients in whom AEDs were tapered, seizures occurred in the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> of life. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that seizures are a common symptom in patients with HGG during the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> of life and emphasise the importance of adequate AED treatment throughout the EOL phase...|$|R
