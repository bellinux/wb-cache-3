The result was a greater time to dig, resulting in a greater vulnerability to both <b>leakage</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> and tunnel collapse, and a higher loss of lives in the most hideous of circumstances: entombment, drowning, gassing or obliteration in cramped and claustrophobic galleries beneath no man's land.|$|E

Despite {{a number of}} novel, theoretical advances, it has been unclear if and how quantitative approaches to measuring <b>leakage</b> <b>of</b> confidential <b>information</b> {{could be applied to}} substantial, real-world programs.

Our technique is applied to a number <b>of</b> officially reported <b>information</b> leak vulnerabilities in the Linux Kernel. Additionally, we also analysed authentication routines in the Secure Remote Password suite and of a Internet Message Support Protocol implementation.

Trading suspicious of illegal insider trading and <b>leakage</b> <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> measured in terms of cumulative average abnormal returns and volumes for the 30 days prior to the news announcement, has significantly declined for small capitalization firms, for announcements containing information about alliances and mergers and acquisitions and for firms in the technology sector. ...|$|E
