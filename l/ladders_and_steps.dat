50|$|In {{order to}} enable walkers to {{experience}} this rock landscape at closer hand, {{in recent years}} a range of themed walks has been established. In the Wasgau these include the Dahn Rock Path (Dahner Felsenpfad), the Busenberg Clog Path (Busenberger Holzschuhpfad) the Hauenstein Cobbler Path (Hauensteiner Schusterpfad) and the Annweiler Red Sandstone Path (Annweilerer Buntsandsteinpfad). Whilst most rocks remain the province of professional climbers, certain rock terraces may be accessed on foot (e. g. the Buhlsteine, Heidenpfeiler and Rötzenstein) or may be climbed, with care, {{with the aid of}} <b>ladders</b> <b>and</b> <b>steps</b> (e. g.

50|$|There is {{evidence}} of mining with shafts on the cliffs nearby at Trenance Point, and adits above the beach at Carnewas. The National Trust shop was originally the count house (office) of Carnewas Mine and the cafe {{was one of the}} mine buildings. Between 1871 and 1874, 940 tons of brown haematite were produced and it is thought that the <b>ladders</b> <b>and</b> <b>steps</b> to the beach were needed to reach the mine workings. The name Bedruthan Steps is said to be taken from a mythological giant called 'Bedruthan' who used the rocks (stacks) on the beach as stepping stones, and seems to be a late nineteenth century invention for Victorian tourists. The first written record of the name is from the West Briton newspaper in February 1847 and is likely to refer to one of two cliff staircases used by miners to get to the mine workings and now refers to the whole beach.|$|E

It is wellknown that both lattice <b>and</b> <b>ladder</b> <b>steps</b> are powerful enough to generate all perfect reconstructing filter banks provided that the filter coefficients may take arbitrary values in a field.

INTRODUCTION Assume that a signal is given by {{an element of the}} Laurent polynomial ring A[z; z Γ 1], where A is either the field of real numbers A = R or the field of complex numbers A = C. Recall that a multirate filter bank basically computes the convolution of this signal with several analysis filters, and reduces the sampling rate, say, by dropping every other output coefficient.

50|$|As a {{consequence}} of its good long-distance views over the whole mountain massif, the mountain is a popular walking area. The mountains of Untersberg, Hoher Göll and Watzmann may be seen to the south, and the Zwiesel and Hochstaufen to the north. The summit may be ascended from various sides, e.g. via the Predigtstuhl or along the Törlschneid from Winkl. The ascent on the Alpgartensteig path has an easy klettersteig character with several <b>ladders,</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> cables as protection. The route is only suited to experienced mountain walkers, because {{you need to have}} a head for heights and sure-footedness.From the top, you can walk to the top station of the Predigtstuhl Cable Car and from there get to the Bad Reichenhall Cable Car. It is also possible to walk from the Steinerne Agnes rocks and to the Rotofen rock towers.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Chronic {{low back}} pain is an {{expensive}} and difficult condition to treat. One of the interventions widely used by physiotherapists {{in the treatment of}} chronic non-specific {{low back pain}} is exercise therapy based upon the Pilates principles. Pilates exercises can be performed with or without specific equipment. These two types of Pilates exercises have never been compared on a high-quality randomised controlled trial. Methods/design This randomised controlled trial with a blinded assessor will evaluate eighty six patients of both genders with chronic low back pain, aged between 18 and 60 years, from one Brazilian private physiotherapy clinic. The patients will be randomly allocated into two groups: Mat Group will perform the exercises on the ground while the Equipment-based Group will perform the Pilates method exercises on the following equipment: Cadillac, Reformer, <b>Ladder</b> Barrel, <b>and</b> <b>Step</b> Chair. The general and specific disability of the patient, kinesiophobia, pain intensity and global perceived effect will be evaluated by a blinded assessor before randomisation and at six weeks and six months after randomisation. In addition, the expectation of the participants and their confidence with the treatment will be evaluated before randomisation and after the first treatment session, respectively. Discussion This will be the first study aiming to compare the effectiveness of Mat and Equipment-based Pilates exercises in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain. The results may help health-care professionals in clinical decision-making and could potentially reduce the treatment costs of this condition.

5|$|The next {{match of}} the evening was the fourth-annual Money in the Bank ladder match, in which there were no {{disqualifications}} or countouts, {{and the only way}} to win the match was to climb a ladder in the ring and retrieve a contract briefcase hanging above. The match featured Chris Jericho, Mr. Kennedy, and Carlito from the Raw brand; CM Punk, Shelton Benjamin and John Morrison from the ECW brand; and Montel Vontavious Porter (M.V.P.) from the SmackDown brand. Jeff Hardy was supposed to be in the match, but he violated the wellness program and was taken out of the match. Early in the match, Morrison climbed a turnbuckle and performed a moonsault onto other competitors outside the ring while holding a ladder against his chest. Later, while Kennedy and Morrison were battling on top of a ladder, Benjamin climbed another ladder placed adjacent to the first one and performed a sunset flip powerbomb on Kennedy, who in turn superplexed Morrison from the top of the <b>ladder.</b> Later, Carlito <b>and</b> Kennedy flipped Benjamin off a ladder in the ring, sending him crashing through another ladder set-up between the barricade and the ring apron. When MVP was close to retrieving the contract briefcase, Matt Hardy (returning to action after suffering a legitimate injury), entered the ring from the crowd, climbed the <b>ladder,</b> <b>and</b> delivered a Twist of Fate to MVP off that ladder. As soon as Morrison started to climb a ladder, see-sawing with another ladder, Jericho flipped the other one and Morrison landed on the ring-ropes groin-first. Jericho even performed a Codebreaker on Punk using a ladder. In the end, Jericho and Punk fought each other on a ladder, but Punk trapped Jericho's one leg in the <b>ladder's</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> retrieved the briefcase to win the match. This was an interpromotional match.|$|R
