50|$|An {{electromagnetic}} reverberation chamber (also {{known as}} a reverb chamber (RVC) or mode-stirred chamber (MSC)) is an environment for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing and other electromagnetic investigations. Electromagnetic reverberation chambers have been introduced first by H.A. Mendes in 1968. A reverberation chamber is screened room {{with a minimum of}} absorption of electromagnetic energy. Due to the low absorption very high field strength can be achieved with moderate input power. A reverberation chamber is a cavity resonator with a high Q factor. Thus, the spatial distribution of the electrical and magnetic field strengths is strongly inhomogeneous (standing waves). To reduce this inhomogeneity, one or more tuners (stirrers) are used. A tuner is a construction with large metallic reflectors that can be moved to different orientations in order to achieve different boundary conditions. The <b>Lowest</b> <b>Usable</b> <b>Frequency</b> (LUF) of a reverberation chamber depends {{on the size of the}} chamber and the design of the tuner. Small chambers have a higher LUF than large chambers.|$|E
50|$|The maximum usable {{frequency}} regularly {{drops below}} 10 MHz in darkness during the winter months, while in summer during daylight it can easily surpass 30 MHz. It depends on the angle of incidence of the waves; it is lowest when the waves are directed straight upwards, and is higher with less acute angles. This means that at longer distances, where the waves graze the ionosphere at a very blunt angle, the MUF may be much higher. The <b>lowest</b> <b>usable</b> <b>frequency</b> depends on the absorption in the lower layer of the ionosphere (the D-layer). This absorption is stronger at low frequencies and is also stronger with increased solar activity (for example in daylight); total absorption often occurs at frequencies below 5 MHz during daytime. The result of these two factors is that the usable spectrum shifts towards the lower frequencies and into the Medium Frequency (MF) range during winter nights, while on a day in full summer the higher frequencies {{tend to be more}} usable, often into the lower VHF range.|$|E
40|$|To use a Reverberation Chamber (RC) {{below the}} <b>Lowest</b> <b>Usable</b> <b>Frequency,</b> this thesis applies: {{multiple}} receiving antennas; multiple EUT positions; and a modified validation procedure. Emission measurements are then possible {{down to the}} first cavity resonance. The design is based on theory and simulations, and validated by on a prototype. The longer measurement times, compare to conventional RCs are acceptable where sensitivity is of concern, e. g. in radio astronomy or defence applications...|$|E
50|$|The <b>lowest</b> <b>usable</b> high <b>{{frequency}}</b> (LUF), {{in radio}} transmission, is that frequency in the HF band {{at which the}} received field intensity is sufficient to provide the required signal-to-noise ratio for a specified time period, e.g., 0100 to 0200 UTC, on 90% of the undisturbed days of the month. The amount of energy absorbed by the lower regions of the ionosphere (D region, primarily) directly impacts the LUF.|$|R
40|$|A {{previous}} research on multivariate approach to the calculation of reverberation chamber correlation matrices {{is used to calculate}} the number of independent positions in a mode-stirred reverberation chamber. Anomalies and counterintuitive behavior are observed in terms of number of correlated matrix elements with respect to increasing frequency. This is ascribed to the regular geometry forming the baseline cavity (screened room) of a reverberation chamber, responsible for localizing energy and preserving regular modes (bouncing ball modes). Smooth wall deformations are introduced in order to create underlying Lyapunov instability of rays and then destroy survived regular modes. Numerical full-wave simulations are performed for a reverberation chamber with corner hemispheres and (off-) center wall spherical caps. Field sampling is performed by moving a mechanical carousel stirrer. It is found that wave-chaos inspired baseline geometries improve chamber performances in terms of <b>lowest</b> <b>usable</b> <b>frequencies</b> and number of independent cavity realizations of mechanical stirrers.

50|$|The {{ionization}} of {{the atmosphere}} varies with time of day and season {{as well as with}} solar conditions, so the upper frequency limit for skywave communication varies on an hourly basis. MUF is a median frequency, defined as the highest frequency at which skywave communication is possible 50% of the days in a month, as opposed to the <b>lowest</b> <b>usable</b> high <b>frequency</b> (LUF) which is the frequency at which communication is possible 90% of the days, and the Frequency of optimum transmission (FOT).|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{physical}} parameter well adapted {{to assess the}} degree of overmodedness of a reverberation chamber (RC) is the number $M_M$ of modes overlapping in a mode bandwidth. The <b>lowest</b> <b>usable</b> <b>frequency</b> of an RC often corresponds to a low modal overlap {{of one or two}} modes. Notwithstanding, in spite of this poor number of modes the RC still works. We show, using Monte Carlo simulation, that the number of modes must, in fact, not be restrained to $M_M$ and that the number of modes contributing to the field statistics can be, even at low modal overlap, somewhat larger than expected...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{ability of}} a {{metallic}} cavity to sustain an isotropic diffusive regime is a necessary condition {{in order to be}} used as a reverberation chamber (RC) in narrow-band settings, for which field samples are expected to behave as complex Gaussian random variables. Yet, no reliable method has been introduced so far that accurately predicts the <b>lowest</b> <b>usable</b> <b>frequency</b> (LUF), starting from which field samples are more likely to pass goodness-of-fit (GoF) tests, statistical tools that can measure how well field samples reproduce Gaussian variables. This letter presents Monte Carlo simulation results that prove that the likelihood of passing GoF tests can be accurately predicted by measuring power transmission through the RC, without any a priori information about its characteristics. These results allow to identify the LUF from which a cavity is fit to generate rich multipath environments, as ideally expected for RCs, e. g., for over-the-air tests of wireless devices, and EMC tests...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} devoted to the {{comparison}} between different criteria used to evaluate the functioning of a mechanically stirred reverberation chamber. Usual criteria based on power or electric fields are considered, and we also propose a criterion based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, called in this paper "success ratio to Kolmogorov-Smirnov test" (SRKS). The SRKS represents the acceptation ratio of this test applied at several points of the working volume, when considering a field component and its associated theoretical distribution. After a presentation of the criteria and of the studied chamber, data issued from 3 -D finite-difference time-domain simulations and measurements are used to analyze the chamber functioning by the use of these criteria. This study is performed on a large frequency band, in the lossless case as well as with a lossy chamber, and for several stirrer shapes, to emphasize the influence of these parameters. The comparison of the usual criteria with the SRKS shows the SKRS is an accurate test to estimate the <b>lowest</b> <b>usable</b> <b>frequency</b> of a given reverberation chamber...|$|E
40|$|High {{frequency}} (HF) radio frequencies {{are between}} 3 and 30 MHz. [1] Also {{known as the}} decameter band or decameter wave as the wavelengths range from one to ten decameters. Shortwave (2. 310 - 25. 820 MHz) [1] overlaps and is slightly lower than HF. Since the ionosphere often reflects HF radio waves quite well (a phenomenon known as skywave), this range is extensively used for medium and long range terrestrial radio communication. However, suitability of {{this portion of the}} spectrum for such communication varies greatly with a complex combination of factors[1]: • Sunlight/darkness at site of transmission and reception • Transmitter/receiver proximity to terminator • Season • Sunspot cycle • Solar activity • Polar aurora • Maximum <b>usable</b> <b>frequency</b> • <b>Lowest</b> <b>usable</b> high <b>frequency</b> • Frequency of operation within the HF rang...|$|R
40|$|The use of foot-mounted {{inertial}} {{measurement units}} (IMUs) has shown promising results in providing accurate human odometry {{as a component}} of accurate indoor pedestrian navigation. The specifications of these sensors, such as the sampling frequency have to meet requirements related to human motion. We investigate the <b>lowest</b> <b>usable</b> sampling frequency: To do so, we evaluate the frequency distribution of different human motion like crawling, jumping or walking in different scenarios such as escalators, lifts, on carpet or grass, and with different footwear. These measurements indicate that certain movement patterns, as for instance going downstairs, upstairs, running or jumping contain more high frequency components. When using only a low sampling rate this high frequency information is lost. Hence, it is important to identify the <b>lowest</b> <b>usable</b> sampling <b>frequency</b> and sample with it if possible. We have made a set of walks to illustrate the resulting odometries at different frequencies, after applying an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) using Zero Velocity Updates. The odometry error is highly dependent on the drift of the individual accelerometers and gyroscopes. In order to obtain better odometry it is necessary to perform a detailed analysis of the sensor noise processes. We resorted to computing the Allan variance for three different IMU chipsets of various quality specification. From this we have derived a bias model for the UKF and evaluated the benefit of applying this model to a set of real data from walk...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn the {{practice}} and research on reverberation chambers, the concept of unstirred field components have often been invoked as soon as empirical distributions fail to comply with goodness-of-fit tests applied to data collected at a frequency of operation far beyond the <b>lowest</b> <b>usable</b> <b>frequency.</b> The current explanation for this phenomenon is that under certain conditions, the field samples generated {{by means of a}} stirring procedure are not characterized by a zero average-value, but actually present a deterministic offset term that is linked to a line-of-sight contribution. In this paper, we prove that this practice is not sound, as it does not acknowledge the fact that even a very low but non-zero residual correlation between the samples is enough to put in jeopardy the validity of the limits imposed by most hypothesis-test statistics, and hence their ability in properly detecting any constant contribution. An alternative approach is here proposed, based on the analysis of the variability of the line-of-sight contribution estimate, capable of accounting for the residual correlation in a reverberation chamber. Experimental results are presented to support the validity of our approach, exposing the critical use of goodness-of-fit tests as currently applied...|$|E
40|$|A 5 x 4 m reverberating {{chamber of}} 3 m height has {{recently}} been installed in the group EES at Eindhoven University of Technology. The room is intended for EMC studies of emission and immunity of equipment and for the coupling of installation cables and shielding structures. Initially the room will be used up to 1 GHz; the final goal is 40 GHz. The <b>lowest</b> <b>usable</b> <b>frequency</b> depends on the room size. The quality factor and the electrical field strength related to the input power have been modeled to predict the chambers behavior. Model and the measurements match acceptably well. A simulation has been preformed as well with a Method of Moments model (FEKO) and indicates that the room fulfills the IEC requirements (less than 4 – 3 dB standard deviation) on statistical field uniformity starting at 200 MHz. Higher frequencies up to 1 GHz have been calculated as well, and agreement with IEC has been observed. The calibration results were not {{in line with the}} models and simulation.

40|$|Electrical and {{electronic}} equipment installed on military platforms must have very low electromagnetic emission and good immunity {{for the whole}} operational frequency range. Reverberation Chambers (RC) are tools for sensitive emission measurements and immunity tests against strong electromagnetic fields, {{at a lower cost}} than other techniques. Method of RC should be suitable for testing Military's electronic devices such as radio or radar system. However, RCs must be large for tests at low frequencies; for example, at 80 MHz are conventional RC must have dimensions up to 7 m by 15 m by 8 m. For military concern, the lowest operation frequency can be as low as 2 MHz (underwater communication can be lower). Conventional RCs can only be used above a certain frequency, the <b>lowest</b> <b>usable</b> <b>frequency</b> (LUF), as they require a minimum mode density (number of modes per frequency interval) in order for the stirrer to perform effectively and alter field distributions. Technique of MIMO RC [1, 2] can make RCs usable down to much lower frequencies; it can mean the dimensions of the chamber can be up to 6 times smaller. However, the composite Q-factor of RCs can be rather low at low frequencies, and this affects the sensitivity, and ultimately usability of an RC. This paper studies the possibility to increase composite Q-factor when RC is used at lower frequencies than conventional method...|$|E

40|$|The {{ionosphere}} is {{the part}} of the earth's atmosphere beginning at an altitude of about 30 miles and extending outward 1, 200 miles or more. This region consists of layers of free electrically charged particles that transmit, refract, and reflect radio waves, allowing those waves to be transmitted great distances around the earth. The interaction of the ionosphere on impinging electromagnetic radiation depends on the properties of the ionospheric layer, the geometry of transmission, and the frequency of the radiation. For any given signal path through the atmosphere, a range of workable frequency bands exists. This range, between the maximum usable frequency (MUF) and the <b>lowest</b> <b>usable</b> <b>frequency</b> (LUF), is where radio waves are reflected and refracted by the ionosphere much as a partial mirror may reflect or refract visible light. 56 The reflective and refractive properties of the ionosphere provide a means to transmit radio signals beyond direct "line-of-sight" transmission between a transmitter and receiver. Ionospheric reflection and refraction has therefore been used almost exclusively for long-range HF (from 3 to 30 MHz) communications. Radio waves with frequencies ranging from above 30 MHz to 300 GHz are usually used for communications requiring line-of-sight transmissions, such as satellite communications. At these higher frequencies, radio waves propagate through the ionosphere with {{only a small fraction of}} the wave scattering back in a pattern analogous to a sky wave. Communicators receive significant benefit from using these frequencies since they provide considerabl...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{results from}} the NONCENTRIC experiment, conducted by the University of Leicester, in which five trans-auroral and polar cap HF propagation paths were monitored during two one-month campaigns. Signal strength, noise level, Doppler spreading and signal recognition were determined each hour on fourteen frequencies in the range 3 to 23 MHz. The diurnal variations in signal recognition and signal strength {{are consistent with the}} ionospheric changes produced by solar illumination. This behaviour is modified by processes occurring within the auroral zone and polar cap during disturbed geomagnetic conditions. Electron densities within the auroral ionosphere increase as a consequence of particle precipitation during disturbed conditions. Auroral enhancement of the D region attenuates signals on trans-auroral paths. This occurs in bursts with durations of tens of minutes, simultaneous with the occurrence of substorms. The magnitude of the absorption can be correlated with changes in the geomagnetic field at geosynchronous orbit. In contrast, enhanced electron densities within the auroral zone E and F regions increase the maximum frequency of propagation, especially at night, thus extending the propagation bandwidth. Within the winter polar cap ionosphere, sporadic high frequency propagation becomes possible from ionization patches convected from the dayside ionosphere. Prolonged periods of geomagnetic disturbance result in global changes in F region electron density, known as ionospheric storms. Four storms studied produce a decrease in the maximum usable frequency, a degradation of propagation reliability and, within the polar cap, an increase in the <b>lowest</b> <b>usable</b> <b>frequency.</b> Such periods of propagation degradation typically have a duration of five days, even during mild storm conditions.

The upper <b>usable</b> <b>frequency</b> depends on the conductivity of the walls and it is at least 18 GHz. The introduction gives basic information and usage of the reverberation chamber, while the theory is explained in the next section. Unlike other facilities used in the testing of electromagnetic compatibility, the reverberation chamber works with many higher order modes. While other chambers or cells try to avoid the appearance of higher order modes, which tend to destroy a uniform electromagnetic field, the reverberation chamber takes full advantage thereof, creating a statistically homogenous electromagnetic field. After a theoretical overview, there follows the design for building the reverberation chamber, as well as the method of its control, especially the movement of mode stirrers necessary for the reverberation chamber to operate. The lower <b>usable</b> <b>frequency</b> of the chamber depends on the size.
