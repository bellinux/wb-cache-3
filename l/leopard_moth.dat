25|$|The Pobjoy Pirate was a three-seat, high-wing {{monoplane}} {{designed to}} compete with the de Havilland <b>Leopard</b> <b>Moth</b> using a low power but light Pobjoy radial engine. Flight tests showed the Pirate to be uncompetitive and its development was rapidly abandoned.|$|E
25|$|Marden {{remained}} in {{use as a}} civil Emergency Landing Ground. On 27 October 1919, a Handley Page O/400 of Handley Page Transport landed at Marden due to strong winds preventing it reaching Croydon. On 13 August 1923, de Havilland DH.34 G-EBBW of Instone Air Line landed at Marden due to a broken oil pipe. The aircraft was repaired and returned to Croydon. One Wednesday in September 1927, an Air Union aircraft on a flight from Paris to Croydon landed at Marden due to engine trouble. Another aircraft was sent from Croydon to collect the 11 passengers {{and take them to}} their destination. Marden was still in operation in 1934, when it was mentioned in Kelly's Directory for Kent. In August 1934, a de Havilland <b>Leopard</b> <b>Moth</b> on a flight from Heston to St Inglevert, France made a landing at Marden as a child passenger was suffering from airsickness. The flight was resumed after the child had recovered. Marden closed on 24 June 1935, and the land then reverted to farmland. A RAF wireless station was based on the site during the Second World War. The last aircraft to land at Marden was on 10 October 1940, during the Battle of Britain, when a Hawker Hurricane of 253 Squadron made a forced landing and overturned, the pilot escaping with a cut thumb.|$|E

Only a few managed to survive six years of hard usage although a small number were still airworthy seventy years after the last was completed. Six remained operational in the U.K. in 2009.|$|R
50|$|Sesioidea is the {{superfamily}} currently containing clearwing moths (Sesiidae), castniid moths (Castniidae) {{and little}} bear moths (Brachodidae). There is evidence from head and thoracic morphology {{that the first}} two families, internally feeding in plants as caterpillars, are sisters, whilst some brachodids are known to feed on leaf surfaces (Edwards et al., 1999).

500|$|In October 1932, a Spartan A.24 Mailplane (G-ABLI) left Lympne {{en route}} for Karachi from Blackpool. Karachi was reached {{in less than}} six days. On 14 November 1932, Amy Johnson left Lympne for Cape Town in DH.80a Puss Moth (G-ACAB). She beat her husband Jim Mollison's time by 10 hours and 28 minutes, setting a new UK-South Africa record. On the return she also set a new South Africa-UK record. On 11 April 1933, William Newton Lancaster {{departed}} Lympne in an Avro Avian V (G-ABLK) Southern Cross Minor to beat Amy Johnson's UK-South Africa record. The aircraft crashed in the Sahara next day and although Lancaster survived he died eight days later when his water ran out. On 2 November 1934, Owen Cathcart Jones and Ken Waller landed at Lympne in a de Havilland Comet (G-ACSR) after a record breaking flight from Australia to the United Kingdom. Harry Frank Broadbent landed at Lympne in a DH.85 <b>Leopard</b> <b>Moth</b> (VH-AHB) on arrival from Australia on 27 April 1937, filmed by Gaumont News, and an Australia-UK record was set. [...] On 24 October 1937 Jean Batten flew to Lympne in a Percival Gull Six (G-ADPR), having set a solo Australia-UK record and female Australia-UK record.|$|E

Until 1935 Pobjoy Airmotors Ltd had not previously built an aircraft, but concentrated successfully on engines. [...] In June 1935 the company name was changed to Pobjoy Airmotors and Aircraft Ltd and at the same moment they introduced their only original aircraft design, the Pobjoy Pirate, aimed at the <b>Leopard</b> <b>Moth</b> market. They naturally chose to power it with one of their own seven cylinder radial engines. [...] At the time, the most powerful variant was the 90hp (67kW) Niagara III, much less powerful than the 145hp (108kW) Gipsy Major 10 of the <b>Leopard</b> <b>Moth.</b> [...] The Pobjoy, though was less than half the weight of the de Havilland engine and Pobjoy believed that with the advantage of this weight saving (about 160lb or 73kg) they could build a lighter and smaller aircraft that would perform as well.|$|E

2500|$|The Tata Airmail Service, {{as it was}} called, {{continued}} on to Pune, Bellary, and Madras. This was the birth of Air India, which, in 1932, was based here out of a hut with a palm thatched roof and had 1 pilot and 2 apprentice mechanics with 2 piston engined aircraft, a Puss Moth and a <b>Leopard</b> <b>Moth.</b> Two bitumen runways - one aligned East-West and the other [...] North-NorthWest - South-SouthEast were laid in 1936. During the monsoons, operations had to be shifted to Poona due to water logging. A third runway was planned for construction in 1939 but this never occurred. It served as the city's airport up to and during World War II.|$|E
