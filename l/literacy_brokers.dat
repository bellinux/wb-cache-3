This paper presents the findings from a project that tracked the growth of L 2 English writing centers in German universities from 2013 - 2015, locating their emergence within changes in the German academic landscape. Using data taken from questionnaires and interviews, this paper locates and explores ten L 2 English writing centers in Germany, focusing on their aims; organizational models and teaching approaches; staffing and funding; key university partnerships; offers; and reflections on the future. It is hoped that these collated experiences could be of interest to other L 2 English centers developing in different countries and language contexts...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} a key {{aspect of}} Chinese scholars writing {{for publication in}} English: {{the role played by}} local English teachers as <b>literacy</b> <b>brokers</b> or “text mediators”. Increasingly, academics in China are required to publish their research in prestigious international journals to progress their careers, and are turning to local English teaching colleagues for assistance. The expense, uncertain competence and sometimes dubious ethical practices of professional editing services, combined with the co-present contact and personal relationships formed with local colleagues, mean that Chinese English teachers are rapidly becoming a valuable resource for turning the massive number of Chinese submissions into publishable papers. This relationship, however, is complicated by the lack of institutional funding for language mediation of this kind and by the uncertainties of appropriate reward for this work. This paper examines the kinds of cooperation and difficulties experienced between local English teachers and scientists in some Chinese universities...|$|E
40|$|This book puts {{writing at}} the centre of sociolinguistic inquiry drawing {{on a range of}} {{academic}} fields including New Literacy Studies, semiotics, genre studies, stylistics and new rhetoric. The key question the book explores is- what do we mean by ‘writing’ in the 21 century? Using examples from across a range of contexts the book argues that writing, involving both old and new technologies, is a pervasive and complex communicative feature of contemporary life. The book is organised around the following areas: •	The multimodal nature of writing •	The verbal dimension to writing •	Writing as everyday practice •	Writing as a differentiated semiotic and social resource •	Writing as the inscription of identity A range of analytic tools for analysing writing as text and practice are illustrated including genre, register, discourse and metaphor, as well as notions which emphasise the mobile potential of writing such as genre chains, networks, <b>literacy</b> <b>brokers</b> and text trajectories. This book seeks to redress the neglect of writing in the field of sociolinguistics by introducing readers to the nature and consequences {{of what it means to}} do writing in a globalised world. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{influx of}} {{international}} students to Malaysia {{in pursuance of}} tertiary education has created the urgency to ascertain the English literacy struggles faced by these students in the Malaysian classrooms {{as well as the}} suitability of the current pedagogical practices in addressing their existing literacy practices. Insights on the aforementioned aspects could be gained by examining the students’ <b>literacy</b> <b>brokering</b> engagements. <b>Literacy</b> <b>brokering</b> refers to an act of seeking informal help in various forms from fellow language users when facing unfamiliar texts or text-oriented practices and events. This case study therefore examined the <b>literacy</b> <b>brokering</b> phenomenon occurring within a Malaysian university’s intensive English Language class. The research participants consisted of 15 international students from five different countries. The specific objectives of the study were to: (i) identify the themes involved in <b>literacy</b> <b>brokering</b> interactions occurring in the Malaysian university English language classroom context; and (ii) describe the literacy practices of the international students in their English class. Through the methods of audio and video recording, 98433 words of transcribed data were collected. An in-depth analysis of the data revealed the primary brokering theme to be the English language system, specifically aspects of grammar and semantics. However culture and genre-based themes were also apparent. The brokerage of culture and genre stemmed from the mismatch between the participants’ existing literacy knowledge with those in their current context of living. The findings create an andragogic importance to include learners’ socio-cultural schemata in designing and carrying out nonnative language pedagogy. In the spirit of contextualising learning experience, future works could focus on analysing the <b>literacy</b> <b>brokering</b> occurrences in other non-native English Language classrooms such as Singapore and Hong Kong...|$|R
5000|$|By {{adopting}} the label language professional, those who offer writing support services emphasize {{that they are}} dedicated to running a service business (or, if employed, they adopt an entrepreneurial spirit) and that their conduct is guided by professional values and ethics. As professionals, they work with confidence and use specialized knowledge and skills to find tailored solutions for each client's request. Language professionals have also been called professional language consultants, as outlined by Mediterranean Editors and Translators: [...] "Professional language consultants distinguish themselves {{by the quality of}} their product, by a strong sense of business ethics, and by a high level of professional organization." [...] Another term sometimes used is language service provider, while the related, but broader <b>literacy</b> <b>broker</b> includes [...] "editors, reviewers, academic peers, and English-speaking friends and colleagues, who mediate text production in a number of ways".|$|R
40|$|Scholars {{around the}} world are under {{increasing}} pressure to publish their research in the medium of English. However, little empirical research has explored how the global premium of English influences the academic text production of scholars working outside of English-speaking countries. This article draws on a longitudinal text-oriented ethnographic study of psychology scholars in Hungary, Slovakia, Spain and Portugal to follow the trajectories of texts from local research and writing contexts to English-medium publications. Our findings indicate that a significant number of mediators, ‘literacy brokers’, who are involved in the production of such texts, influence the texts in different and important ways. We illustrate in broad terms {{the nature and extent of}} <b>literacy</b> <b>brokering</b> in English-medium publications and characterize and exemplify brokers’ different orientations. We explore what kind of brokering is evident in the production of a specific group of English-medium publications- articles written and published in English medium inyternational journals-by focising on three text histories. We conclude by discussing what a focus on brokering can tell us can tell us about practices surrounding academic knowledge production...|$|R
40|$|This thesis study {{followed}} six MA in English Language Teaching/Applied Linguistics {{students as}} they started out on their one-year programmes at the University of Reading, UK. They came from various academic, professional and national backgrounds. One was a native speaker of English; the other five were not. The study takes an ethnographic approach in exploring how these mature students learned to meet writing requirements in this context (which were within the essayist tradition of academic literacy), both as individual case studies and as a group. The focus was on three Terml writing assignments which all students had in common. However, the research sought to contextualise first term experiences {{in the framework of}} the whole year of study. I therefore interviewed these students about their writing five times in the year, including after submission of their year-end dissertations, and contacted them again a year later for post-course insights. The study explored how they responded to pre-submission advice from tutors and their reactions to and use of summative feedback provided. It also examined assignment briefings and documentation, students' meetings with personal tutors and my interviews with module tutors, as well as feedback on outlines and on the three assignments, and the assignments themselves. Although the students were, of course, six unique individual cases, themes emerged from this study of their development as academic writers in this context. These include the influence of background (such as academic, professional, discipline, linguistic), personal characteristics (eg expectations and approach to learning), and the role of <b>literacy</b> <b>brokers...</b>|$|E
40|$|Mexican {{temporary}} migrants in Canada: a sociolinguistic approach Canada is well recognized {{because of}} its immigration policies and settlement programs that include ESL classes that help newcomers in its adaptation and integration process, recognizing in this way that linguistic competence is crucial for the social inclusion and engagement of migrants. However, migratory laws do not contemplate these kinds of help for temporary migrants that come from Mexico and the Caribbean through the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Program (SWAP). The SWAP {{has been a source}} of relevant economical, political, and social research with important policy implications. Within the literature, language barriers have always been mentioned as a major problem of this population because it amplifies migrants’ challenges of social and work needs, relations and adaptation, but there is no evidence of sociolinguistic research. In my study, I pretend to study the sociolinguistic situation of the SAWP workers from Mexico through a sociolinguistic census that will be applied to one hundred participants along five chosen cities in two Canadian provinces, where I will compare language acquisition and/or attrition and it’s relationship to workers’ exclusion, linguistic adaptation, attitude, identity and vulnerability, considering social variables such as age, sex, place of origin, education, literacy level, income, social networks, ESL access, Spanish <b>literacy</b> access, language <b>brokers,</b> ITS access, etc. I assume that some of my findings will be that the deficient or inexistent linguistic competence of the language of the majority in an environment of language contact is a manifestation of exclusion and segregation of the Mexican seasonal agricultural workers in Canada...|$|R
