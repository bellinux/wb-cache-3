30|$|From {{the value}} of Table 5, all micro-structures of entirely di-block {{copolymers}} are ellipsoid in structure. The ellipsoid structures elongate {{with the increase of}} PE volume fraction. We use the ratio of Rg 12 /Rg 22 and Rg 12 /Rg 32 to compare their micro-structures. When the equilibrated structure is a perforated <b>lamellae</b> <b>structure,</b> the ratios are 0.38 and 0.32 at 10 / 10 / 1 volume fraction. When the equilibrated structure is tube-like, the ratios are about 0.8 at 2 / 18 / 1 and 6 / 14 / 1 volume fractions. This {{can be attributed to the}} different equilibrated structure at three volume fractions. The equilibrated structure at 10 / 10 / 1 volume fraction is perforated lamellae. The micro-structure of the entirely di-block copolymer is the longest and thinnest. In particular, this shape can arrange parallel to form the perforated <b>lamellae</b> <b>structure.</b> When the volume fraction of PE polymer increases, the equilibrated structure changes from perforated lamellae to the tube-like structure. If the micro-structure is thin and elongated, it is difficult for PLLA polymers to fill the spaces which are not occupied by the PE polymer and CNTs. Hence, it is easy for the shorter and wider ellipsoid structure to form the tube-like structure. Unlike the blend system, where no relationship exists between the micro-structure and the equilibrated structure, in the di-block copolymer system, the micro-structure and equilibrated structure have specific relationships such as the long and thin ellipsoid forming the perforated lamellae. It is difficult in the blend system to find the relationship between micro-structures and equilibrated structures due to the unrestricted conditions between PE and PLLA polymers.|$|R

The formation of high-symmetry networks from low-symmetry building blocks is a particularly important target. Alkylated isophthalic acid (ISA) derivatives are early test systems, and it was demonstrated that to produce a so-called porous hexagonal packing of plane group p 6, i. e., a regular array of nanowells, either short alkyl chains or the introduction of bulky groups within the chains were mandatory.
