40|$|Available from: [URL] a {{wide variety}} of {{industrial}} applications, an increasing demand exists to improve the reliability and availability of induction motor drives.

Mechanical faults are most commonly detected through vibration or noise monitoring, but stator current monitoring is an interesting alternative. Indeed, current sensors are cost-effective, easy to implement, and most drives already contain such sensors for protection and control purposes. However, the effects of mechanical faults on the stator currents are more indirect compared to vibration or noise analysis.

40|$|Introduction: The term Clinimetric was {{introduced}} by Feinstein in 1982, who first noticed that despite all the improvements in the assessment methods, a number of clinical phenomena were still unconsidered during the evaluation process. Yet today clinical phenomena, such as stress, relevant in diseases progression and course, are not completely evaluated. Only recently, according to the clinimetric approach, Fava and colleagues have introduced specific criteria for evaluating the allostatic overload in clinical setting.

40|$|Many {{decisions}} in the everyday work of the structural engineer are taken {{under the influence of}} uncertainties. The degree of uncertainty affects the quality and variability of the outcome of the structural design work. The effect of uncertainties related to knowledge and experience of the structural engineer was studied in a round robin investigation. Despite a relatively well defined task, the results varied considerably among the 16 participating Swedish structural engineers that performed this task; a structural check, load takedown and stability calculation for a five storey concrete building. The column load of a specific position differed by a factor of three between lowest and highest suggested value. For the stabilizing forces the values varied even more. The uncertainties connected to the structural engineer were estimated by introducing the term Engineering Modeling Uncertainty, divided into a structural model part and a <b>load</b> <b>part.</b> These uncertainties are shown to have a large effect on structural safety. The significant variability in results and the consequence on structural safety of this investigation emphasizes the importance of documentation and communication of all the assumptions made by the structural engineer - even the apparently obvious ones.

40|$|A {{description}} is given {{of the global}} atmospheric electric circuit operating between the Earth’s surface and the ionosphere. Attention is drawn to the huge range of horizontal and vertical spatial scales, ranging from 10 − 9 m to 1012 m, concerned with the many important processes at work. A similarly enormous range of time scales is involved from 10 − 6 s to 109 s, in the physical effects and different phenomena {{that need to be}} considered. The current flowing in the global circuit is generated by disturbed weather such as thunderstorms and electrified rain/shower clouds, mostly occurring over the Earth’s land surface. The profile of electrical conductivity up through the atmosphere, determined mainly by galactic cosmic ray ionization, is a crucial parameter of the circuit. Model simulation results on the variation of the ionospheric potential, ∼ 250 kV positive with respect to the Earth’s potential, following lightning discharges and sprites are summarized. Experimental results comparing global circuit variations with the neutron rate recorded at Climax, Colorado, are then discussed. Within the return (<b>load)</b> <b>part</b> of the circuit in the fair weather regions remote from the generators, charge layers exist on the upper and lower edges of extensive layer clouds; new experimental evidence for these charge layers is also reviewed. Finally, some directions for future research in the subject are suggested...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFatigue {{crack growth}} period in {{cylinder}} heads of A 356 -T 7 casting alloy {{has been found}} to constitute {{an important part of the}} structure's total life. Therefore, the fatigue model design should consider crack propagation life. Then, in order to find a new crack growth law, finite element simulations on a cylinder head 3 D model and fatigue crack tests have been conducted as to establish the contribution of each loading parameter in governing the crack propagation. SEM, optical microscopy and other metallographic techniques have been used to examine fracture surfaces and to analyze particles cracking. It has been found that the crack growth mechanism changes gradually at the microstructural scale with the increasing of Kmax value. Performing tests at variable frequencies has shown important crack growth time dependence. Negative load ratio tests have revealed a primordial importance of the compressive <b>load</b> <b>part</b> on the crack advance. Using experimental and numerical results, a new "damage tolerant" model design based on a non-isothermal crack growth prediction law has been introduced. The law is based on a corrected linear elastic fracture mechanics stress intensity factor Kp accounting for the cumulative crack tip plasticity. The law figures all of the purely fatigue effect, the crack growth under monotonic loading condition (time dependent parameter) and the effect of the compressive load on the global crack advance...|$|E

40|$|The {{idea behind}} the service life model {{presented}} in this report was published in 1979. It has thereafter been described and developed {{in a number of}} reports and papers. The basis of the model is the observation that a well-defined critical, or maximum allowable, moisture content exists, above which the material is severely damaged by frost, and below which it is unharmed also when freezing is repeated at numerous occasions. This means that there is an analogy between design with regard to frost resistance and design with regard to structural safety. The critical moisture condition corresponds to the fracture load at structural design, whilst the real moisture condition corresponds to the actual load in structural design - the load effect. This also means that design with regard to frost resistance is to a high extent a moisture mechanics problem - one must be able to predict the future moisture variation {{in all parts of the}} structure. The analogy with structural design means that the same theory can be used for calculation of the probability of frost damage as for the risk of structural failure. The report focuses on the moisture mechanics part of the problem - i. e. the <b>load</b> <b>part.</b> The possibility to predict moisture by theoretical calculation is evaluated, and found to be small...|$|E

These {{tests were conducted}} on CT 16 and SEN specimens for different positive and negative load ratios, temperatures, frequencies and stress intensity factor values {{in order to establish}} the contribution of each parameter governing the fatigue crack propagation. It was shown that the decrease of the frequency causes significant increase of the crack growth rate especially at high temperatures and load ratios. The performing of negative load ratio tests had shown a primordial importance of the compressive <b>load</b> <b>part</b> of fatigue on the crack advance. In addition, SEM, optical microscopy and other metallographic techniques were used to examine fracture surfaces and to analyze particles cracking. For positive load ratios tests, it was shown that in stage II (Paris regime) and stage III (high crack growth rates) the number of cracked particles increases with Kmax and gradual changes in fracture surface appearance occur. These changes were associated with different crack growth mechanisms at the microstructural scale. The amplitude of the inelastic deformations and the extent of the plastic zone ahead of the crack tip were used to explain the observed changes in crack growth mechanisms. The crack growth under negative load ratio loads is especially analyzed, and a way of deriving this rate is given and shown to be relevant even for nonisothermal loading...|$|E
