40|$|In {{this paper}} we study rankings induced by power indices of players in simple game models of {{bicameral}} legislatures, the US <b>legislative</b> <b>system,</b> and similar <b>legislative</b> <b>systems.</b> We {{show that a}} member of the smaller house of a bicameral legislature has more power than {{a member of the}} larger house, in almost all cases. Using a standard model of the US <b>legislative</b> <b>system</b> as a simple game, we look at rankings of the four types of players - the president, the vice president, senators, and representatives. We show that regardless of the power index used, the president is always ranked above the other players, and a senator is always ranked above a representative and ranked the same as or above the vice president. For most power index rankings, including the Banzhaf and Shapley-Shubik power indices, the vice president is ranked above a representative, however, there exist power indices ranking a representative above the vice president.

40|$|The PRC Law-making Law was promulgated {{to solve}} {{problems}} plaguing the Chinese <b>legislative</b> <b>system,</b> such as conflicts between laws, violation of legislative powers and procedures, and poor legislative quality. However, its role may be more symbolic than practical. Among the achievements of this new legislation, the division of legislative powers is most impressive. It signifies the institutionalization of China's <b>legislative</b> <b>system</b> and incorporation of federalist elements into the Chinese state system. On the other hand, the law itself contains serious problems, eg insufficient guarantees for local legislative powers, lack of an independent <b>legislative</b> supervision <b>system,</b> and omission of any powers for the courts to interpret laws. These problems render the prospects for using the law to solve legislative problems rather slim.

40|$|Since the Treaty of Lisbon, the <b>legislative</b> <b>system</b> of the European Union {{is based}} on a {{distinction}} between legislative acts and non-legislative acts as well as on a distinction between delegation and implementation. This system has brought about several issues that received a fair degree of scholarly attention prior to the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and in the initial years thereafter. The new Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law Making (IIA) has addressed some of these issues, but this still leaves the question open as to how this new <b>legislative</b> <b>system</b> is to be implemented in practice. This article reviews these issues, first, in light of the new IIA and, second, in light of the legislative practice that has emerged since then. The revision of the Directive on Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision is taken as the legislative case in this respect. This case includes political conflicts between mostly national and EU legislatures but also conflicts with regard to the substance of some EU provisions. It also evaluates the role of EU agencies – in this case the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) – within the rules of the EU’s <b>legislative</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R

40|$|Android allows {{applications}} {{to communicate with}} <b>system</b> <b>service</b> via <b>system</b> <b>service</b> helper so that applications can use various functions wrapped in the <b>system</b> <b>services.</b> Meanwhile, <b>system</b> <b>services</b> leverage the service helpers to enforce security mechanisms, e. g. input parameter validation, to protect themselves against attacks. However, service helpers can be easily bypassed, which poses severe security and privacy threats to <b>system</b> <b>services,</b> e. g., privilege escalation, function execution without users’ interactions, <b>system</b> <b>service</b> crash, and DoS attacks. In this paper, we perform the first systematic study on such vulnerabilities and investigate their impacts. We develop a tool to analyze all <b>system</b> <b>services</b> in the newly released Android system. Among the 104 <b>system</b> <b>services</b> and over 3, 400 <b>system</b> <b>service</b> methods in the system, we discover 22 vulnerable service interfaces that can be exploited to launch real-world attacks. Furthermore, we implement and construct attacks to demonstrate the impacts of these vulnerabilities. In particular, by utilizing these vulnerabilities, these attacks result in implicit user fingerprint authentication in background, NFC data retrieval in background, Bluetooth service crash, and Android system crash...|$|R

By using a dataset of 162 jurisdictions and dummy variables designed to capture the current stage of IFRSs adoption and, respectively, the taxonomy of their <b>legislative</b> <b>systems,</b> we find that a full IFRSs adoption is more likely to occur in countries which have principles-based on legislative mono-systems. In addition, we observe that a strong rule of law, with an effective mechanism of property rights reinforcement, as well as the pre-adoption existence of a pro-growth set of public policies can contribute to the encouragement of IFRSs adoption. ...|$|R

We also argue that this proposition should be tested solely on the population of countries with direct presidential elections.

This latter point applies to the debate about the determinants of the <b>legislative</b> party <b>system</b> but also to debates about the effect of presidential power more generally...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{important}} <b>system</b> <b>services,</b> particularly network <b>system</b> <b>services,</b> need strong scaling on multi-core systems, where a fixed workload is executed more quickly with increased core counts.

In this paper, we propose a replicated work approach to parallelizing network <b>system</b> <b>services</b> for multi-core <b>systems</b> based on a multiple-instruction/single-data (MISD) execution model. In particular, we discuss the advantages of this approach for scalable network <b>system</b> <b>services</b> and we compare past methods for addressing the challenges this approach presents.
