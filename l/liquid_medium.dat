There are many different electrolytes in use. Generally, the electrolytes will be distinguished into two species, non-solid and solid electrolytes.

25|$|Heat removal {{is done by}} {{internal}} cooling coils. The synthesis gas is bubbled through the waxy products and finely-divided catalyst which is suspended in the <b>liquid</b> <b>medium.</b> This also provides agitation {{of the contents of}} the reactor. The catalyst particle size reduces diffusional heat and mass transfer limitations. A lower temperature in the reactor leads to a more viscous product and a higher temperature (>nbsp&570nbsp&K) gives an undesirable product spectrum. Also, separation of the product from the catalyst is a problem.|$|E

As a <b>liquid</b> <b>medium</b> which has ion conductivity caused by moving ions, non-solid electrolytes can easily fit the rough structures.

25|$|Root exudates from AMF host plants {{grown in}} a <b>liquid</b> <b>medium</b> {{with and without}} {{phosphorus}} {{have been shown to}} affect hyphal growth. Spores of Gigaspora magarita were grown in host plant exudates. Hyphae of fungi grown in the exudates from roots starved of phosphorus grew more and produced tertiary branches compared to those grown in exudates from plants given adequate phosphorus. When the growth-promoting root exudates were added in low concentration, the AM fungi produced scattered long branches. As the concentration of exudates was increased, the fungi produced more tightly clustered branches. At the highest-concentration arbuscules, the AMF structures of phosphorus exchange were formed.|$|E
25|$|The term colloid is used {{primarily}} {{to describe a}} broad range of solid-liquid (and/or liquid-liquid) mixtures, all of which contain distinct solid (and/or liquid) particles which are dispersed to various degrees in a <b>liquid</b> <b>medium.</b> The term is specific {{to the size of the}} individual particles, which are larger than atomic dimensions but small enough to exhibit Brownian motion. If the particles are large enough, then their dynamic behavior in any given period of time in suspension would be governed by forces of gravity and sedimentation. But if they are small enough to be colloids, then their irregular motion in suspension can be attributed to the collective bombardment of a myriad of thermally agitated molecules in the liquid suspending medium, as described originally by Albert Einstein in his dissertation. Einstein concluded that this erratic behavior could adequately be described using the theory of Brownian motion, with sedimentation being a possible long-term result. This critical size range (or particle diameter) typically ranges from tens of angstroms (10−10m) to a few micrometres (10−6m).|$|E

2500|$|Michael Faraday began, in 1832, what {{promised to}} be a rather tedious attempt to prove that all electricities had {{precisely}} the same properties and caused precisely the same effects. The key effect was electrochemical decomposition. Voltaic and electromagnetic electricity posed no problems, but static electricity did. As Faraday delved deeper into the problem, he made two startling discoveries. First, electrical force did not, as had long been supposed, act at a distance upon molecules to cause them to dissociate. It was the passage of electricity through a conducting <b>liquid</b> <b>medium</b> that caused the molecules to dissociate, even when the electricity merely discharged {{into the air and}} did not pass through a [...] "pole" [...] or [...] "center of action" [...] in a voltaic cell. Second, the amount of the decomposition was found to be related directly to the amount of electricity passing through the solution.|$|E
