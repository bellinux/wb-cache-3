The tubes are available in various sizes, and also with a flat top, which is useful for signet rings.|$|E
50|$|The pole lathe's origin {{is lost in}} antiquity; we {{know that}} Vikings used them from the archaeological finds at Jórvík, the Viking {{settlement}} discovered beneath the modern city of York in England. The use of pole lathes died out in England after World War II. It has seen a return through the increased interest in green woodwork, {{although the majority of}} practitioners are at the hobby rather than professional level. Around Britain there are regular courses for learning the art of pole <b>lathe</b> <b>turning</b> and associated skills, culminating in making chairs or simpler items.|$|E

50|$|Friction {{between the}} {{segments}} and the brushes eventually causes wear to both surfaces. Carbon brushes, being {{made of a}} softer material, wear faster and may be designed to be replaced easily without dismantling the machine. Older copper brushes caused more wear to the commutator, causing deep grooving and notching of the surface over time. The commutator on small motors (say, less than a kilowatt rating) is not designed to be repaired through {{the life of the}} device. On large industrial equipment, the commutator may be re-surfaced with abrasives, or the rotor may be removed from the frame, mounted in a large metal lathe, and the commutator resurfaced by cutting it down to a smaller diameter. The largest of equipment can include a <b>lathe</b> <b>turning</b> attachment directly over the commutator.|$|E
40|$|An NC program {{simulator}} {{has been}} developed for evaluating productivity in NC <b>lathe</b> <b>turning.</b> Machining information about cutting parameters, tool paths and operating time are retrieved from an NC program by the simulator. These information are very useful in order to evaluate productivity in NC <b>lathe</b> <b>turning.</b> A total of 193 NC programs from 29 manufacturing companies are investigated their productivity by comparing the percentage of jog feeding time during turning operation. The result of the investigation shows that the jog feeding time occupies about 80 % of total operation time on an average of 193 examples. The simulation of the revised NC programs using the touch and cut method which eliminates an air-cut travel during jog feeding shows that the operation time of the NC program can be reduced about 6 % on an average. The cutting test for estimating tool life proved that the touch and cut method does not reduce the tool lifetime under the experimental cutting condition...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Grinding is {{the process}} of {{removing}} metal by the application of abrasives which are bonded to form a rotating wheel. When the moving abrasive particles contact the work piece, they act as tiny cutting tools, each particle cutting a tiny chip from the work piece. It is a common error to believe that grinding abrasive wheels remove material by a rubbing action; actually, the process is as much a cutting action as drilling, milling, and <b>lathe</b> <b>turning...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{suitable}} tool {{materials for}} <b>lathe</b> <b>turning</b> were M 20 and P 20 containing {{a considerable amount}} of TiC and TaC in 1 st report. As milling process is a discontinuous cutting, the impact forces act upon the cutting edges when they engage and disengage the workpiece. And the tools are also heated and cooled alternately by cutting and idle processes per one cycle. Therefore, the suitable tool material for face milling differs from one for <b>lathe</b> <b>turning.</b> The suitable tool material for face milling 18 - 8 stainless steel is selected among the same tools in 1 st report. The suitable nose radius and width of land of cutting edges are also selected in this experiment. 1. Suitable tool material differs for cutting speed range, that is, high speed steel tool SKH 4 and sintered carbide tool M 20 suit to face milling operation in low cutting speed and other cutting speed range respectively. 2. Remarkable separation of welds appears on face milling 18 - 8 stainless steel. If it appears near cutting edge, the cutting edge should fail at once. Because of suitable nose radius and width of land decreasing the appearance and separation of welds, tool life increases and useful cutting speed range expands...|$|E

The size of the micro cutting system is so small that the working situation must be observed under an optical microscope. Circular bar of 0. 3 mm in diameter is cramped and rotated with little eccentricity. Several materials such as copper, brass and Ti are cut into the minimum size of about 10 μ m in diameter. And also the influence that is given to cutting force under several cut conditions has been discussed. Especially, {{the influence of the}} depth of cut and the feed of cut on the cutting force and the specific cutting force has been investigated in the cutting process of each material...|$|E

40|$|The Primary {{objectives}} of this creative project were {{the exploration of}} well-known fairy tales (such as Snow White), {{and the process of}} creating interactive jewelry based on my own personal interpretation of these stories. I designed and constructed seven jewelry pieces using traditional metal working techniques along with innovative contemporary surface treatments such as etching, sandblasting and colored pencil decoration. Each piece contained a "surprise" interactive element - some pieces contain moving parts, while others contain small pieces of fabric tape on which sentences are written. These tapes are mechanized to wind up into the ring or pendant.

40|$|We review {{existing}} and develop new statistical techniques {{for the analysis}} of experiments where the response is the geometric shape of a manufactured part. The analysis of variance for shapes is discussed. An F test and a permutation test for detecting differences in shape are presented. It is shown how the permutation test provides higher power for 2 D circular profiles than the traditional methods used in manufacturing practice, which are based on the circularity form error. The proposed permutation test does not require the error assumptions needed in the F test, which may be restrictive in practice. New visualization tools, including main effect and interaction plots for shapes and deviation from nominal plots are presented to aid in the interpretation of the experimental results.

40|$|Abstract – In this {{research}} work, induced vibrations and surface roughness of a tool-work-piece {{system in a}} turning process and their effect on product quality are examined. Attempts {{have been made to}} use vibration signals in predicting surface quality of product from lathe machine operation using response surface methodology. The surface roughness of machined parts is also predicted using the response surface methodology. The data are generated by <b>lathe</b> <b>turning</b> of 41 Cr 4 Alloy steel samples at different levels of low, medium and high of selected machining parameters. Prediction equations for induced vibration and surface roughness for 41 Cr 4 alloy steel was generated. From the experimental results, it shows that increasing the acceleration of cutting tool with increase in the tool nose radius will cause an increase in surface roughness of work piece if induced vibration in the system is significant. This effect interacts with other independent variables such as depth of cut and cutting speed...|$|E
