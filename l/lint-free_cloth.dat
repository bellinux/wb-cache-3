5000|$|The wax is evenly {{and lightly}} applied over the surface, then lightly buffed {{with a smooth}} <b>lint-free</b> <b>cloth</b> to give a sheen. Where {{the shape of the}} item requires, a brush may be used instead. It is also used in jewelry making to {{preserve}} the patina of the metal.|$|E
50|$|After the {{identified}} dwell time has passed, penetrant {{on the outer}} surface of the material is then removed. This highly controlled process is {{necessary in order to}} ensure that the penetrant is removed only from the surface of the material and not from inside any identified flaws. Various chemicals can be used for such a process and vary by specific penetrant types. Typically, the cleaner is applied to a <b>lint-free</b> <b>cloth</b> that is used to carefully clean the surface.|$|E
50|$|The {{printing}} {{depends on}} the smooth flow of ink, which can be hindered if the ink begins to dry at the print head, as can happen when an ink level becomes low. Dried ink can be cleaned from a cartridge print head using isopropyl alcohol or water. Isopropyl alcohol will damage the printing head, melting the plastic at the connections and rubber gaskets. Tap water contains contaminants that may clog the print head, so distilled water and a <b>lint-free</b> <b>cloth</b> is recommended.|$|E
50|$|When {{objects are}} in good condition, normal surface dirt and grime is removed safely by a few {{different}} ways. One way is using a soft brush to lightly dust the object, dislodging dust and debris. To remove surface dust a variable speed vacuum, soft <b>lint-free</b> <b>cloths,</b> vinyl eraser crumbs, volcanized rubber sponges, and micro-attachments are also tools that can be utilized.|$|R
5000|$|Insert a {{piece of}} silver wire into {{concentrated}} HCl then allow the wire to dry on a <b>lint-free</b> cleaning <b>cloth.</b> This forms an insoluble layer of AgCl {{on the surface of}} the electrode and gives you an Ag/AgCl wire. Repeat dipping every few months or if the QRE starts to drift.|$|R
5000|$|In {{recent decades}} {{researchers}} have developed <b>lint-free</b> tack <b>cloths,</b> made from continuous filament (non-fibrous) synthetic yarns and finished edges (similar to electronics cleanroom wipers, this design is commonly required for paint process in automotive assembly plants). Another innovation has been modification of common tack cloths that are normally electrically resistive {{to perform at}} antistatic levels, defined by independent standards organizations (like ASTM, IEEE, MIL-SPEC, etc.).|$|R
5000|$|The excess {{penetrant}} is then {{removed from}} the surface. The removal method {{is controlled by the}} type of penetrant used. Water-washable, solvent-removable, lipophilic post-emulsifiable, or hydrophilic post-emulsifiable are the common choices. Emulsifiers represent the highest sensitivity level, and chemically interact with the oily penetrant to make it removable with a water spray. When using solvent remover and <b>lint-free</b> <b>cloth</b> it is important to not spray the solvent on the test surface directly, because this can remove the penetrant from the flaws. If excess penetrant is not properly removed, once the developer is applied, it may leave a background in the developed area that can mask indications or defects. In addition, this may also produce false indications severely hindering the ability to do a proper inspection. Also, the removal of excessive penetrant is done towards one direction either vertically or horizontally as the case may be.|$|E
50|$|Optical media disks {{often require}} {{professional}} preventative or routine cleaning to ensure data accuracy and accessibility; {{those with no}} professional experience may scratch the disk surface {{in their attempt to}} clean the disk. Build up of dust and oily contaminants on the disk surface, and fingerprints can typically impede the laser beam’s ability to penetrate the substrate to read the data layer, and more often impede writing. Minor interferences with reading is handled by error correction technology. If an audio CD (with a much lower accuracy threshold than a data disk) becomes dirty, it can be cleaned safely with a dry, soft <b>lint-free</b> <b>cloth,</b> holding the disc by the edges or by the center hole. Light dirt that is not removed by this method can be removed with a cloth dampened with water or a suitable optical disc-cleaning fluid. It has been advised that excess dust be blown off an optical disc before reading, to avoid buildup of dust in the reader, particularly on the laser.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{recommended}} that discs be cleaned before—and after—each playback, carbon-fibre brushes are quite effective. Records should be cleaned in a circular motion, {{in the direction of}} the grooves. Distilled water (not tap water as it will leave behind mineral deposits) and a soft, <b>lint-free</b> <b>cloth</b> is a common method of cleaning. Another method is to clean the LP on the turntable with a disc cleaning brush (the Discwasher system is frequently recommended by the audio press). A simple [...] "cleaning bath" [...] device called the Spin Clean gives good results, and there are also vacuum machines on the market such as the Nitty Gritty, Keith Monks, Clearaudio, and VPI, which are recommended for more a thorough cleaning. In recent years, ultrasonic cleaning machines from manufacturers such as Klaudio (Korea) and Audio Desk Systeme (Germany) have also been used with great success. The effectiveness of the ultrasonic machines coupled with their premium price tags (both $4,000 US in January 2015) has opened the door for companies to offer professional ultrasonic cleaning at an affordable cost of just a few dollars per record. Another cleaning product recently released called Record Revirginizer uses a polymer that is applied to record surface then left to dry, the polymer is then peeled from the surface taking the microscopic contaminants with it. Though in the past, using alcohol on vinyl LPs was considered safe, experts now caution against it unless absolutely necessary, as alcohol threatens the loss of the plasticizer or stabilizer. As vinyl is often prone to electrostatic charges that cause dust and debris to be attracted to its surface, anti-static products can be used if needed.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of their}} portability, laptops {{are subject to}} more wear and {{physical}} damage than desktops. Components such as screen hinges, latches, power jacks, and power cords deteriorate gradually from ordinary use, and {{may have to be}} replaced. A liquid spill onto the keyboard, a rather minor mishap with a desktop system (given that a basic keyboard costs about US$20), can damage the internals of a laptop and destroy the computer or result in a costly repair. One study found that a laptop is {{three times more likely to}} break during the first year of use than a desktop. To maintain a laptop, it is recommended to clean it every three months for dirt, debris, dust, and food particles. Most cleaning kits consist of a <b>lint-free</b> or Microfiber <b>cloth</b> for the LCD screen and keyboard, compressed air for getting dust out of the cooling fan, and cleaning solution. Harsh chemicals such as bleach should not be used to clean a laptop, as they can damage it.|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} is {{a process}} for cleaning a cathode tube and other subassemblies in a hollow cathode assembly. In the disclosed process, hand covering elastomer gloves are used for handling all cathode assembly parts. The cathode tube and other subassemblies are cleaned with a <b>lint-free</b> <b>cloth</b> damped with acetone, then wiped with alcohol, immersed in ethyl alcohol or acetone, and ultrasonic agitation is applied, heating to 60 C. for ethyl alcohol or 56 C. for acetone. The cathode tube and other subassemblies are dried by blowing with nitrogen gas...|$|E
30|$|The {{contamination}} by {{the hydraulic}} oil {{was carried out}} with a syringe; a drop {{was placed on the}} sample and was subsequently wiped off with a conventional <b>lint-free</b> <b>cloth.</b> This procedure was repeated until no residues were {{visible to the naked eye}} and only an oil film remained. In order to have different levels of concentration, two different methods of wiping the oil off were applied, based on scenarios likely to be encountered during production. In the first method, the oil was wiped off with a little pressure, and in the other method, the pressure applied to the cloth was increased.|$|E
