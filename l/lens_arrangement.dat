5000|$|Before mass separation, {{a beam of}} {{positive}} ions has to be extracted from the plasma and focused into the mass-analyzer. It is important to separate the ions from UV photons, energetic neutrals and from any solid particles {{that may have been}} carried into the instrument from the ICP. Traditionally, ICP-MS instruments have used transmitting ion <b>lens</b> <b>arrangements</b> for this purpose. Examples include the Einzel lens, the Barrel lens, Agilent's Omega Lens [...] and Perkin-Elmer's Shadow Stop. Another approach is to use ion guides (quadrupoles, hexapoles, or octopoles) to guide the ions into mass analyzer along a path away from the trajectory of photons or neutral particles. Yet another approach is Varian patented used by Analytik Jena ICP-MS 90 degrees reflecting parabolic [...] "Ion Mirror" [...] optics, which are claimed to provide more efficient ion transport into the mass-analyzer, resulting in better sensitivity and reduced background.

40|$|AbstractThis article exposes how we {{improved}} (by {{more than}} a factor of four) the green Lunar Laser Ranging instrumental sensitivity of the French telemetric station of the “Observatoire de la Côte d’Azur” in 2012. The primary reason for this success is the doubling of the pulse energy of our green Nd:YAG laser, reaching now 200 mJ at 10 Hz. This first gain {{is due to the}} replacement (inside our oscillator cavity) of the dye cell with a CR 4 +:YAG crystal saturable absorber. Complementary spatial beam profile improvements are also described, regarding polarisation, flashlamp geometry and specific <b>lens</b> <b>arrangements</b> (to exclude ghosts from focusing on the 8 m long amplification chain). Those combined laser enhancements pave the way to future science breakthrough linked to quasi-millimetric determination of the Earth–Moon dynamics (Murphy, 2013). Jointly, we propose an empirical thermal lensing model, varying with the cycle ratio of the flashlamps. Our model connects Koechner’s (1970) continuous pumping to our intermittent pumping case, with a “normalised heating coefficient” equalling 0. 05 only if the electrical lamp input power is equal to 6 kW and scaling as this [electrical input power into the lamps] to the power of [half the pumping cycle ratio]...|$|R

In comparison to SJ-231 radar used by the latest model of KS-1, HT-233 has a thousand more phase shifter on its antenna array, totaling four thousand, {{as opposed to the}} three thousand of SJ-231.

40|$|When {{rendering}} or capturing stereoscopic images, two {{arrangements of}} the cameras are possible: radial ("toed-in") and parallel. In the radial case all {{of the cameras}}' axes pass through a common point; in the parallel case these axes are parallel to one another. The radial configuration causes distortions in the viewed stereoscopic image, manifest as vertical misalignments between parts of the images seen by the viewer's two eyes. The parallel case does not su#er from this distortion, and is thus {{considered to be the}} more correct method of capturing stereoscopic imagery. The radial case is, however, simpler to implement than the parallel: standard cameras or renderers can be used with no modification. In the parallel case special <b>lens</b> <b>arrangements</b> or modified rendering software is required. If a pinhole camera is assumed it should be readily apparent that the same light rays pass through the pinhole in the same directions whether the camera is aligned radially to or parallel to the other cameras. The di#erence lies in how these light rays are sampled to produce an image. In the case of a non-pinhole (real) camera, objects in focus should behave as for the pinhole case, while objects out of focus may behave slightly di#erently. The geometry of both radial and parallel cases is described and it is shown how a geometrical transform of an image produced in one case can be used to generate the image which would have been produced in the other case. This geometric transform is achieved by a resampling operation and various resampling algorithms are discussed. The resampling process can result in a degradation in the quality of the image. An indication of the type and severity of this degradation is given...|$|R

It has been shown that with the residuals and the parameter values such as might be used in the type 111 triplet, this equation gives three positive roots of which only one leads to a practical solution. It was shown that if certain parameters which enter into the coefficients of Yob in this cubic equation are given values much greater than is usual in a type 111 objective, a second root of the equation leads to a practical solution. In this way, a new region of triplet solution has been opened - up characterised by low powers for the components in the initial thin <b>lens</b> <b>arrangement.</b> It was expected that this region would provide a basis for the development of high aperture objectives.

Model systems used in demonstrating the complementarity of the techniques and their merits included the nuclear excision repair (NER) system, transcription regulation by the androgen receptor (AR), and signal transduction by two membrane receptors, the EGF receptor and the IL 2 -receptor.

Such decomposition processes on the industrial scale is known as spray pyrolysis and is a common method for making metal and metal oxide particles. Metal nitrate aerosols were passed through a tube furnace to induce thermal decomposition and transformation into oxides, and were delivered with high efficiency into the vacuum system of the single particle mass spectrometer using an aerodynamics <b>lens</b> <b>arrangement.</b> The particles were ablated and torn down to atomic ions with a tightly focused, high-power pulsed laser in the extraction field of the time-of-flight mass spectrometer.
