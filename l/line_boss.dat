50|$|The updated game {{added to}} the amount of enemy bullets that were fired at the player, but gave the player the ability to hold down the shot button {{instantly}} changing the shot into a focused stream of power (to the detriment of the player's plane's movement speed), much like the laser in the Donpachi series, thus bringing the title more in line with other bullet hell shooters. A useful addition to Black Label is the inclusion of an on-screen meter to display just where the player's Rank currently resides. This was an unknown quantity in the previous release and made playing with the aim of achieving a top score more difficult as there was no definite way of telling whether the player's rank was being raised or lowered. Along similar <b>lines,</b> <b>bosses</b> were given their own visible lifebars to aid the player and to add a more tangible feeling to their impending defeat. The PlayStation 2 arrange mode also offered the option to alter the coloring of the enemy bullets in order to aid visibility, or instead to opt for the original arcade colors.|$|R

5000|$|During a 128-0 {{victory over}} Buffalo in 1901, Gregory {{reportedly}} {{asked for an}} opportunity to run the ball for a touchdown. In his history of the Michigan football program, Jim Cnockaert described the incident as follows:"Dad Gregory, the team's center, complained at one point that everyone on the team had scored a touchdown in the game except him. Later, as the Wolverines closed in again on the goal <b>line,</b> <b>Boss</b> Weeks signaled for Gregory to line up in the backfield and promised to hand him the ball. Gregory plowed through the line and dove into the end zone, yelling, 'I'm over! I'm over!' However, Weeks played a trick on the play, pulling the ball away at the last second so that Gregory was not awarded the touchdown."A profile of Gregory in the 1903 University of Michigan yearbook noted:"While not an exceptionally heavy man, his build attracted early in the fall of 1901 ... Yost tried him at center and he developed rapidly. His weight is low down, giving him stability for that position. ... In nearly all the games of the past two seasons he has played against men who have outweighed him, but he has never failed to hold his own. He is aggressive {{from the start of the}} game to the call of time, but his aggressiveness never occasions any undue roughness. ... He is hard and muscular and his build is well adapted to any kind of heavy athletic work. Perhaps the greatest thing about Gregory is his accuracy in passing the ball. He keeps his head well and never allows anxiety or excitement to cause a bad pass. Whether it is the short pass to the quarterback or the long one to the fullback he is absolutely sure. ... Gregory and Ellsworth of Chicago divided honors for the All-Western eleven this year, but there is a disposition among Michigan students, however, to consider Gregory as the superior of any Western center."Prior to the start of the 1903 season, press reports indicated that Gregory and halfback Willie Heston, both of whom had come to Michigan from California with Coach Yost in 1901, might not return to the team. The Detroit Free Press reported in early September 1903 that there was [...] "a business chance beckoning rather strongly to both" [...] and that the players were rumored to be in Detroit to meet with Coach Yost. [...] In 1903, Gregory was identified as the distributor of [...] "Hurry Up Yost Cigars" [...] in advertising published in various University of Michigan publications.|$|E

5000|$|Before {{the end of}} the conference, {{emphasis}} was laid on the fact that all of the future plans and operations had to be appropriated and administered peacefully among the country's bosses and criminal organizations, avoiding the sort of violent conflicts that had plagued the underworld in the past. The highly successful [...] "Big Seven Group" [...] was used as a model of future organization and peace for the new [...] "National Syndicate".

The two major underworld powers were ready to square off in a war, which was seen as running counter to the organizational plans for the future the Atlantic City delegates had agreed upon.

With modern cruise liners the shaft <b>line,</b> brackets, and <b>bossing</b> play a very important role, {{due to the fact that}} they have a major effect on appendage resistance, the wake field and propeller cavitation. The wake field is the most important source of propeller-hull excitations and noise. The advantages of POD propulsion are mainly caused by optimum hull lines, the best possible wake field and small appendage resistance. A wide range of wake measurements together with aft appendage alternatives are described to study carefully their effects to wake field and propulsion coefficients. The wake of conventional appendages is compared with the wake of a podded propulsor in order to get a good view of expectations.

5000|$|Extending from Confederation Hall is the Centre Block's {{north to}} south axis, running between the Library of Parliament and the Peace Tower, through the Hall of Honour, which serves as {{the route of the}} parades for both {{speakers}} of parliament, as well as where the lying in state segment of some state funerals takes place. It is a long, rib vaulted space of Tyndall limestone divided into five bays by superimposed double arcades of lancet arches atop clustered columns on pedestals. These bays are subdivided in half by single-story pointed arches on dark green syenite pillars, above which sit clerestory windows of cusped lights segmented by Missisquoi Black marble posts, though only those on the east of the hall are windows, while the others are blind.Running the length of the hall and resting on corbels carved into early English foliage and other customary symbols, is a ribbed vault ceiling rising to bosses carved with Tudor roses and fleur-de-lis. The hall is bisected by small, vaulted corridors, the east one leading to a committee room, and the west to the old reading room; the latter is known as the Correspondents' Entrance, as it is <b>lined</b> with <b>bosses</b> and label stops sculpted by Cléophas Soucy between 1949 and 1950 into the visages of ten notable parliamentary correspondents: Charles Bishop, Henri Bourassa, John Wesley Dafoe, Joseph Howe, Grattan O'Leary, Frank Oliver, John Ross Robertson, Philip Dansken Ross, Joseph Israël Tarte, and Robert S. White. The north end of the hall is crossed on both levels by the Centre Block's north corridor, with an overlooking gallery lined by iron railings by Paul Beau.The Hall of Honour was intended to be a gallery where statues of notable Canadians would be arranged in the niches along each side. That plan was later abandoned in favour of a more general purpose of commemorating the 1916 fire, as well as honouring those who participated in the Great War. The sculptures remain incomplete; only the north end, closest to the Library of Parliament, has completed carvings. The largest of these stone sculptures is a low relief memorial to nursing in Canada, depicting those care-givers who participated in World War I, while another work, Canada Remembers, pays tribute to those {{who were involved in the}} Second World War. Two other pieces mark the efforts of early nation-building, such as that donated by Canadians living in the United States and which celebrates the 60th anniversary of Confederation.|$|R
