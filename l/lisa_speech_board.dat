5000|$|Due to {{the removal}} of various {{anonymously}} created posters (some depicting members of the faculty and administration with electronically altered images; others unrelated), the Free <b>Speech</b> <b>board</b> {{continues to be a}} source of ongoing contention between LJHS administration, SDUSD legal counsel, and the local ACLU. In recent months, according to the Hi-Tide, posters on the Free <b>Speech</b> <b>board</b> have been removed before two-weeks have elapsed past the written date, which could construe a violation of the 2012 ACLU settlement. The controversy over these posters appears to stem from different perspectives over whether images of this nature constitute satire and [...] "fair comment" [...] in the public interest that bring attention to bear on issues relevant to the school; or whether these posters may be construed as evidence of willful intent to target and defame certain faculty and administrators.|$|R

500|$|While Homer and Bart the all-expense-paid {{perks of}} their trip, Lisa visits famous monuments for inspiration. At one {{particular}} monument, she overhears a corrupt congressman, Bob Arnold, taking a bribe from {{a representative of}} a logging industry to demolish Springfield Forest. Heartbroken and disillusioned by the dishonesty of government officials, Lisa tears up her essay and writes a more painful yet truthful essay to show the patriotic judges. The new essay, entitled [...] "Cesspool on the Potomac", disdains and condemns the government system of corruption and greed, and mentions {{the names of those}} involved in the bribery. Lisa's essay causes a ruckus and elicits a hostile reaction from the judges and audience. Messages are quickly sent around the capital regarding <b>Lisa's</b> <b>speech</b> and Arnold is expelled from his job, arrested and sent to prison. Lisa's essay does not win because of its content, but with the news of arresting the congressman and having become a born-again Christian while in prison, her faith in government is restored, while the contest winner commends Lisa for her courage and honesty. The episode ends with Bart slingshotting the annoying pianist that performed at the contest and he tells Lisa that {{she was the one who}} inspired him to stand up for what he believes in.|$|R
5000|$|Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a C, saying [...] "Going into tonight’s episode “You Don’t Have To Live Like A Referee,” {{there was a}} lot of {{potential}} comic ammo to go around. For one, it’s the Simpsons’ first trip back to Brazil since the infamous season 13 episode “Blame It on Lisa” which angered the Brazilian tourist board so badly that there was a lawsuit in the works. Throw in some of the old reliable Homer/Lisa relationship dynamic (ever the most dramatically evocative on the show), and all the pieces were there to assemble a memorable episode. That what eventually emerged was one of the most perfunctory of the season is genuinely a bummer." [...] Teresa Lopez of TV Fanatic gave the episode three out of five stars, saying [...] "Aside from a touching story, the episode featured some hilarious scenes and sight gags. For one, Kearney placing an [...] "admire me" [...] note on Homer's back (instead of the usual [...] "kick me" [...] sign) during <b>Lisa's</b> <b>speech</b> was nice touch. But that one paled in comparison to the montage of creative bribe offers in Brazil. It was an amusing way to make fun of the rampant corruption found in World Cup competitions." ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{implement}} {{the use of}} alternative communication boards in patients hospitalized and unable to communicate by speech. Methods: A descriptive study {{with a sample of}} 30 patients hospitalized and unable to communicate by <b>speech.</b> <b>Boards</b> were made with Boardmaker® Software that consists of a graphical database containing Pictorial Communication Symbols. To assess {{the quality of life of}} these patients, the Portuguese SF- 36, a translated version of the Medical Outcomes Study, was applied before and after the study. Results: We found that all domains of the SF- 36 showed changes after the application of communication boards. We observed that the minimum score was assigned to the mental health domain, whereas the most affected and with greatest involvement and least compromise was the overall health status. Conclusion: The quality of life assessment of patients showed improvement with the use of communication boards, demonstrating the importance and necessity of communication between the patient and staff and the patient and family members...|$|R
40|$|Distinguished Alumni Award Program author. RADM Michael A. LeFever, USN (Presented 30 May 06) Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. This thesis investigates speech recognition in a {{command and control}} workstation environment. It discusses the Navy's need for a command and control workstation (CCWS) {{and the importance of}} the human interface design. In particular, it evaluates the performance of Stanford Research Institute International (SRI's) 1000 word discrete speech recognizer. The <b>speech</b> <b>board</b> is intended {{to be used in the}} Command and Control Multi-Media workstation being developed by SRI. Additionally, it investigates a VOTAN continuous recognizer (currently for use by research and commercial vendors) in an interactive warfare simulation game. The results indicate that speech recognition systems could increase the capability of the commander to input and access information, provide more rapid response to information desired or displayed, and enhance human interaction in the man-machine interface.

5000|$|Between Friday, February 20, 2015, and Saturday, February 21, 2015, LJHS {{was subject}} to campus-wide {{vandalism}} {{in the form of}} graffiti. In addition to graffiti that was graphic and sexual in nature, the San Diego Union Tribune reported that it was being pursued as a hate crime, in part because the words [...] "White America" [...] and a swastika were a part of the graffiti.

The initial April 25 letter to Dr. Podhorsky took issue with modifications administrators made to the ACLU's original Free Speech policy by putting a new rule sheet on the Free <b>Speech</b> bulletin <b>board</b> on January 12, which ACLU lawyers argued violated the 2012 settlement.|$|R

40|$|Language {{interference}} is {{a phenomenon}} caused by bilingual or multilingual society. Language interference is common in the second language due {{to the influence of}} first language of speakers. In the islamic boarding school community, Javanese is often used by the community everyday. Additionally, Arabic is also quite dominant in daily for learning religious literature.

40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} the {{determinants}} of media coverage of Federal Reserve (Fed) communications. Our sample covers all 344 forward-looking communications made in the period May 1999 -May 2004. We find, first, {{that there is a}} higher likelihood of media coverage for monetary policy reports and speeches by Greenspan than for testimony and speeches by other Fed members. Furthermore, communications with an explicit monetary policy inclination or tone different from the current interest rate path are particularly likely to be covered. However, the release of important macroeconomic news reduces the likelihood of media coverage. Second, speeches by regional Fed presidents are relatively less likely to be reported than <b>speeches</b> by <b>Board</b> members. Nevertheless, media coverage of Fed president speeches is more likely if central bank communication is stale. Finally, our results indicate that Ben Bernanke played a distinguished role even before his chairmanship...|$|R
