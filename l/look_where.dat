What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff – I mean if they're running and they don't <b>look</b> <b>where</b> they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all.|$|E
500|$|... 1–4 months: Primary Circular Reactions – Babies notice {{objects and}} start {{following}} their movements. [...] They continue to <b>look</b> <b>where</b> an object was, but {{for only a}} few moments. They 'discover' their eyes, arms, hands and feet in the course of acting on objects. This stage is marked by responses to familiar images and sounds (including parent's face) and anticipatory responses to familiar events (such as opening the mouth for a spoon). The infant's actions become less reflexive and intentionality emerges.|$|E
500|$|This {{incident}} {{confirms the}} Centre's suspicions that the paratroopers were agents {{of a foreign}} power, but Tintin fears that efforts to trace any leaked information would be futile. The rocket is successfully launched and orbits the moon as planned, but on its return it is then intercepted by the aforementioned foreign power, who have used the leaked information concerning the rocket's radio control. However, Tintin had anticipated this and asked Calculus to rig a self-destruct mechanism for the rocket, and the Centre destroys the rocket {{to prevent it from}} falling into enemy hands. Tintin reasons that there must have been an inside spy who leaked information to the paratroopers, but no suspects are found. Preparations are made for the manned expedition to the moon, but after an argument with Haddock, in which Haddock accuses Calculus of [...] "acting the goat", Calculus becomes irate. Usually misunderstanding everything Haddock says, due to being hard of hearing, Calculus was wearing a hearing aid this time, and understood Haddock all too well. Implacable, Calculus angrily gives Haddock a forced tour of the moon rocket. However, in doing so, Calculus forgets to <b>look</b> <b>where</b> he is going, falls down a ladder and suffers amnesia.|$|E

500|$|More {{than one}} scene proved {{problematic}} for Breezy {{during the filming}} of the episode, as the decontamination room set was an enclosed four wall set, meaning that in the scene where Archer rubs down Porthos with decontamination gel, Breezy's trainer Scott Rowe couldn't be on the set with her. Normally {{he would have been}} behind the camera assisting the director by ensuring the dog is looking wherever the scene required. He hoped that with him off the set, that Breezy would <b>look</b> <b>where</b> required and not directly at the camera. In order to prepare for the scene where Porthos leaps out of an immersion tank and into Archer's arms, Rowe had a mock-up created so he could practice it with Breezy. He said that [...] "By the time we went into it on that one day to prep on set with Scott, she was jumping out of it into my arms, but I had to make sure that she's going to jump out and do it into Scott's arms." [...] In the final scene, not only did Breezy leap into Bakula's arms, but she also licked him repeatedly on the face. This wasn't due to training, but because they wiped food on Bakula's face.|$|E

Passive instruments sense only radiation emitted by the object being viewed or reflected by the object from a source other than the instrument. Active instruments emit energy and record what is reflected. Satellite imagery is an example of passive remote sensing. Here are two active remote sensing instruments: ...|$|E

2500|$|On December 19, the Pickering–Mullen Accountability Review Board {{report on}} the Benghazi matter was released. It was sharply {{critical}} of State Department officials in Washington for ignoring requests for more guards and safety upgrades, and for failing to adapt security procedures to a deteriorating security environment. It explicitly criticized the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs: [...] "Systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies at senior levels within two bureaus of the State Department ... resulted in a special mission security posture that was inadequate for Benghazi and grossly inadequate {{to deal with the}} attack that took place." [...] Four State Department officials were removed from their posts as a consequence, including Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security Eric J. Boswell (who resigned completely), a deputy assistant secretary for embassy security, Charlene R. Lamb, and a deputy assistant secretary for North Africa, Raymond Maxwell. The report did not criticize more senior officials in the department; Pickering said: [...] "We fixed it at the assistant secretary level, which is, in our view, the appropriate place to <b>look,</b> <b>where</b> the decision-making in fact takes place, where, if you like, the rubber hits the road." [...] Clinton said in a letter to Congress that she accepted the conclusions of the Pickering–Mullen report, and a State Department task force was formed to implement some sixty action items recommended by the report. On December 20, the Deputy Secretary of State, William J. Burns, and the Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources, Thomas R. Nides, testified in her place before two Congressional committees, and said that many of the report's recommendations would be in place before year-end. Clinton planned to testify herself in January.|$|E
2500|$|Production for {{the episode}} started {{after the first}} run of the series' fourth season, which {{consisted}} of four episodes. At {{the beginning of the}} second run of six episodes (which started broadcasting in June 2000), the episode was assigned a production code number of 405 (meaning the 5th episode of the 4th season), and it was planned to air in June or July that year. However, given the complicated nature of the episode's <b>look,</b> <b>where</b> a lot of things had to be designed from scratch, the studio did not have enough time to finish the episode that summer, and it was moved to the next batch of episodes. As it was already in production before the run, [...] "Pip" [...] was a [...] "banked" [...] episode of South Park, one of the first in the series' history. Whereas most episodes of South Park are done within a week, from scratch, the creators sometimes try to have one episode [...] "in the bank" [...] – meaning that they have [...] "at least half-start" [...] animating it. This way they can take off a few days at one point during the two-month-long, demanding run, and then go back and finish work on the banked show. After finishing the previous episode, [...] "Helen Keller! The Musical", which aired on November 22, 2000, the Wednesday before Thanksgiving (November 23), the creators went to spend time with their families for the holiday, and then came back on Sunday, November 26, to finish [...] "Pip". The episode aired the next Wednesday, on November 29, 2000 on Comedy Central in the United States, as the 14th episode of the season, and the fourth episode of the winter run. Since its original airing, it has been re-run infrequently on Comedy Central.|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} obvious {{recurring}} linguistic motif in the play is that of state power as specifically represented by the crown and the throne. Both words occur multiple times throughout the play. For example, in Act 1, Scene 1 (which is set in parliament, with York spending most of the scene sitting on the throne), Warwick introduces the imagery, saying to York [...] "Before I see thee seated in that throne,/Which now the House of Lancaster usurps,/I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close" [...] (ll.22–24). He then introduces the word [...] "crown"; [...] "Resolve thee Richard, claim the English crown" [...] (l.49). Immediately after York sits in the throne, Henry enters, exclaiming, [...] "My lords, <b>look</b> <b>where</b> the sturdy rebel sits,/Even in the chair of state. Belike he means,/Backed {{by the power of}} Warwick, that false peer,/To aspire unto the crown and reign as king" [...] (ll.50–54). During the subsequent debate over legitimacy, Exeter tells York [...] "Thy father was a traitor to the crown" [...] (l.80), to which York replies [...] "Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown" [...] (l.81). Also during the debate, Henry asks York, [...] "And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?" [...] (l.85). York next asks Henry, [...] "Will you we show our title to the crown? (l.103), to which Henry says [...] "What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?" [...] (l.105). As the debate reaches an impasse, Richard urges York, [...] "Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head" [...] (l.115). Henry refuses to yield however, declaring [...] "Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne?" [...] (l.125). Subsequently, during the debate about the conflict between Henry Bolingbrook and Richard II, York asks Exeter if Richard's abdication [...] "was prejudicial to his crown?" [...] (l.145) to which Exeter responds [...] "No, for he could not so resign his crown" [...] (l.146). York then demands that Henry [...] "Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs" [...] (l.173), to which Henry reluctantly agrees, [...] "I here entail/The crown to thee and to thine heirs forever" [...] (ll.195–196).|$|E
2500|$|A younger {{version of}} Jean, {{alongside}} teenage versions of Scott and Ororo, appears in [...] Now blue-eyed with long, loosely curled orange hair, this new variation of Jean had been located and enrolled sometime {{prior to the}} movie, as she, now in her mid-teens, is introduced as already being a student at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. When Alex Summers brings his younger brother to the school after his own optic laser blasts powers had manifested, Scott bumped into Jean, as he couldn't see due to being blindfolded. [...] Jean drops the many books, binders, and papers she held, but instantly we watch as this new incarnation of Jean telekinetically pulls them back into her hands, exhibiting seemingly little effort, which seems {{to imply that the}} Professor has left her mind unbarred. She gets mad at this, but apologizes as Scott explains he can't exactly <b>look</b> <b>where</b> he's going. Later, Jean is studying by a tree when Scott attempts to talk to her. Seeing the other students show fear, Jean explains that they're afraid of her because they are aware of her full powers, and therefore is treated as an outcast. Jean is affected by the energy wave released by an ancient, god-like mutant who had awakened that day. This causes Jean to have a nightmare of the world ending during which the entire school shakes, most of the students are awoken from sleep, and the Professor hurries to her room to find [...] that her telekinetic powers, already immensely strong, are quite literally burning the walls of her room. Telepathically reaching into Jean's mind to awaken her - an act that causes Charles a sizeable amount of pain - the wooden walls cease to burn and to emit smoke, and the Professor slumps back, substantially exhausted now. The powerful young psychic is reassured by Xavier that she is not losing control of her powers, despite her doubts. When the mansion is destroyed, she comforts Scott over the loss of his own brother and conceals herself, Scott, and Nightcrawler from Stryker's men. While in Stryker's base, she connects with Weapon X (Wolverine), and releases him from his cell. Before he, fearfully, leaves the complex Jean restores the few remaining memories of his that she can. She then joins the fight in Cairo. She telekinetically protects the group from Angel's metal wings. After Xavier is saved, he mentally links with her and reveals to Apocalypse that he is not the most powerful psychic, and convinces Jean to unleash the full extent of her powers. Her eyes glowing with an orangey-golden light, the powerful young Mutant's walks through midair and within a matter of seconds, a massive burst of telekinetic energy explodes outward from within Jean's body, almost instantaneously taking the shape of a great, fiery bird. With a single powerful scream that is as much verbal as it is mental, Jean Grey incinerates Apocalypse and helps to psychically restore and revive Professor Xavier. She is last seen helping to re-build the mansion, alongside Erik Lensherr, before joining Cyclops, Storm, Nightcrawler, Quicksilver, under the leadership of Hank and Raven, to become the new official team of X-Men and preparing to test her powers in her very first Danger Room session against a group of Mark I Sentinels.|$|E
