25|$|Port Chalmers was a port of {{call for}} several notable {{expedition}}s during the heroic era of Antarctic exploration. It was the <b>last</b> <b>port</b> <b>visited</b> by Robert Falcon Scott before heading south on his final expedition to Antarctica. A large stone monument now stands above the town dedicated to Scott's final expedition. Following the 1923 transfer of the Ross Dependency (Antarctica) to New Zealand, and the New Zealand Government's lease of rights, the giant Norwegian whaler, C.A. Larsen, became the largest vessel serviced in the Otago Dock, Port Chalmers, in April 1928.|$|E

After returning from her <b>last</b> <b>port</b> <b>visit</b> in Bermuda, the ship conducted two days sails for families and past crew members, on the 7 and 8 March 2017, respectively. The vessel conducted a final sail past of Halifax harbour on 10 March 2017, upon which she was paid off and the ships company reassigned to other units.|$|R

As the ships left port, it was quickly noticed that the ships were heading in the wrong direction. The 5th patrol off Libya now included Operation El Dorado Canyon, the aerial attacks on Tripoli and terrorist camps near Benghazi. Participating units were awarded the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal. There was an uneventful 6th patrol. Biddle arrived home to much fanfare at Norfolk, Virginia on Armed Forces Day, May 1986. For the entire period, Biddle and other participating units were awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal. Since most of the crew earned two different expeditionary medals, they were forced to choose which one to accept.|$|R
50|$|From 1979 to 1982, Charybdis {{underwent}} modernisation {{that included}} the fitting of Exocet and Sea Wolf missiles, {{and the removal of}} her twin 4.5-in guns. The refit was cut short and Charybdis was rushed back into service due to the Argentinean invasion of the Falkland Islands. In late 1982, {{in the aftermath of the}} Falklands War, Charybdis deployed on a Falkland Islands patrol, which at the time was still a tense region. Through the rest of the 1980s, Charybdis undertook duties in the West Indies, Mediterranean and in the Persian Gulf. In 1984 she was again deploying to the Falkland Islands as part of a task group, but was detached from the group whilst in Gibraltar and diverted to the Gulf region where she joined HM Ships Glasgow and Falmouth and RFA Orangeleaf. On the arrival of Charybdis, HMS Falmouth was detached to the Far East. A group call into Karachi by Charybdis, Glasgow and Orangeleaf for scheduled maintenance was the <b>last</b> <b>port</b> <b>visit</b> by the group as, due to rising tensions, all <b>port</b> <b>visits</b> were cancelled. In 1985 she deployed yet again to the Gulf as part of the Armilla Patrol protecting ships transiting the Straits of Hormuz, and also in 1988. In 1990, Charybdis was on Persian Gulf patrol, with several flying the flag visits in the Far East. She was due to visit America and the Falklands in 1991, but was retasked to return to the eastern Mediterranean to act as Sea Wolf protection for the flagship Ark Royal during the first Gulf War.|$|R

40|$|The United States Navy {{is seeking}} {{substantial}} cost savings {{in the operation}} of its aircraft carrier fleet, including the costs of <b>port</b> <b>visits.</b> This thesis analyzes data on aircraft carrier <b>port</b> <b>visits</b> from fiscal years 2002 through 2007 to develop statistical models for characterizing and predicting port-visit costs. The models account for explanatory factors that include the ship and port, whether the ship is moored pier side or at anchor, length of the <b>port</b> <b>visit,</b> and the arrival date. A total of 13 U. S. Navy Carrier Vessel (CV) and Carrier Vessel Nuclear (CVN) aircraft carriers made 118 <b>visits</b> to <b>ports</b> in 25 countries during the period under study. For each <b>port</b> <b>visit,</b> individual lineitem expenses are aggregated into four categories and by total cost. Regression modeling is then used to identify factors that explain these categorized and total costs. For total costs, the average regression prediction error is about 17 percent. Costs are found to vary across ships and, more substantially, across ports. These findings can be used in the formulation of initiatives aimed at reducing the costs of aircraft carrier <b>port</b> <b>visits.</b> An automated spreadsheet tool is developed to implement the model 1 ing techniques presented in the thesis.
