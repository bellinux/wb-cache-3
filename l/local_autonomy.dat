5|$|This turn {{of events}} proved highly unpopular with the local Greek population, and their representatives under Georgios Christakis-Zografos formed the Panepirotic Assembly in Gjirokastër in protest. The Assembly, short of {{incorporation}} with Greece, demanded either <b>local</b> <b>autonomy</b> or an international occupation by forces of the Great Powers for the districts of Gjirokastër, Sarandë, and Korçë.|$|E

However, the Declaration, {{contrary to the}} Protocol of Corfu, recognized minority rights only in a limited area (parts of Gjirokastër, Sarandë district and 3 villages in Himarë), without implementing any form of <b>local</b> <b>autonomy.</b> All Greek schools in the excluded area were forced to close until 1935, in violation of obligations accepted by the Albanian government at the League of Nations. In 1925, Albania's present borders were set, leading Greece to abandon its claims to Northern Epirus.|$|E

5|$|The {{reality of}} defeat for Austria caused a reevaluation of {{internal}} divisions, <b>local</b> <b>autonomy,</b> and liberalism. The new North German Confederation {{had its own}} constitution, flag, and governmental and administrative structures. Through military victory, Prussia under Bismarck's influence had overcome Austria's active resistance {{to the idea of}} a unified Germany. Austria's influence over the German states may have been broken, but the war also splintered the spirit of pan-German unity: most of the German states resented Prussian power politics.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts was {{a center}} of the {{movement}} for independence from Great Britain; colonists in Massachusetts had long uneasy relations with the British monarchy, including open rebellion under the Dominion of New England in the 1680s. Protests against British attempts to tax the colonies after the French and Indian War ended in 1763 led to the Boston Massacre in 1770, and the 1773 Boston Tea Party escalated tensions. In 1774, the Intolerable Acts targeted Massachusetts with punishments for the Boston Tea Party and further decreased <b>local</b> <b>autonomy,</b> increasing local dissent. Anti-Parliamentary activity by men such as Samuel Adams and John Hancock, followed by reprisals by the British government, were a primary reason for {{the unity of the}} Thirteen Colonies and the outbreak of the American Revolution in 1775.|$|E
5|$|Charles' abdication had {{far-reaching}} {{consequences in}} imperial {{diplomatic relations with}} France and the Netherlands, particularly in his allotment of the Spanish kingdom to Philip. In France, the kings and their ministers grew increasingly uneasy about Habsburg encirclement and sought allies against Habsburg hegemony from among the border German territories; they were even prepared to ally {{with some of the}} Protestant kings. In the Netherlands, Philip's ascension in Spain raised particular problems; for the sake of harmony, order, and prosperity, Charles had not oppressed the Reformation as harshly there as did Philip, and Charles had even had tolerated a high level of <b>local</b> <b>autonomy.</b> An ardent Catholic and rigidly autocratic prince, Philip pursued an aggressive political, economic and religious policy toward the Dutch, resulting in their rebellion shortly after he became king. Philip's militant response meant the occupation of much of the upper provinces by troops of, or hired by, Habsburg Spain and the constant ebb and flow of Spanish men and provisions over the Spanish road from northern Italy, through the Burgundian lands, into and from Flanders.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the Minimum Efficiency Scale (MES) for <b>local</b> <b>autonomies,</b> {{on the basis}} of the Hayashi 2012 model. We estimate the MES of <b>local</b> <b>autonomies</b> in Korea using panel data for 73 cities during the period 2002 - 2010. The main findings of the paper are as follows. First, we find that there are technical economies of scale in local public services as a whole. Second, classifying local public services into the four categories of general administration, economic development, social development, and civil defense, we find that there are technical economies of scale for all categories except civil defense. Third, we try to find the MES for <b>local</b> <b>autonomies</b> by estimating the average costs of local public services as linear and quadratic functions of the logarithm of population. We find that quadratic functions fit the data best and that there are U-shaped curves for all categories of local public services. More importantly, the MES for <b>local</b> <b>autonomies</b> is bigger than the actual size of <b>local</b> <b>autonomies</b> in Korea.

5|$|In the 18th century, the Holy Roman Empire {{consisted}} of approximately 1,800 territories. The elaborate legal system initiated {{by a series}} of Imperial Reforms (approximately 1450–1555) created the Imperial Estates and provided for considerable <b>local</b> <b>autonomy</b> among ecclesiastical, secular, and hereditary states, reflected in Imperial Diet. The House of Habsburg held the imperial crown from 1438 until the death of Charles VI in 1740. Having no male heirs, he had convinced the Electors to retain Habsburg hegemony {{in the office of the}} emperor by agreeing to the Pragmatic Sanction. This was finally settled through the War of Austrian Succession; in the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, Charles VI's daughter Maria Theresa ruled the Empire as Empress Consort when her husband, Francis I, became Holy Roman Emperor. From 1740, the dualism between the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy and the Kingdom of Prussia dominated the German history.|$|E
5|$|The combat that peasant men {{had engaged}} in prior to the revolt was {{restricted}} to the vicinity in which they lived. During armed conflicts, they would often fight for {{a short amount of}} days before returning to cultivate their lands, which remained their main preoccupation. When their service was needed, they were commanded by a local chief who in turn was subordinate to a regional leader. Most armed conflict revolved around the chiefs' bids for local influence and control or protection of villages from Bedouin plundering. There were also instances where peasant fighters would be assembled to back Ottoman authority in the face of local or external challengers, such as during the 1799 Napoleonic invasion, or against Ottoman authority when it interfered in the unofficial <b>local</b> <b>autonomy</b> that was enjoyed in the mountain regions. In most of the conflicts in which the peasant fighters participated, they fought alongside their kinsmen or neighbors.|$|E
5|$|The {{third group}} of {{requested}} amendments pertained to eastern Slavonia. Owen and Stoltenberg requested its status {{to be left}} unresolved, instead of gradually reverting to Croatian control {{over a five-year period}} and applying the postwar ethnic composition of the area as a formula for the ethnic mix of the local police and establishing a joint Croatian-Yugoslav company to extract crude oil in Đeletovci. The proposal was turned down, but it led to <b>local</b> <b>autonomy</b> for Serb villages in the area and reduced the transitional period to two years. The fourth group of proposed amendments, tabled by Owen, included a proposal for continued Serb armed presence in Krajina and additional authority for Krajina concerning mineral resources and international treaties. After the proposals, the text of the plan became the subject of lengthy discussions between the contact group countries, the EU and the ICFY co-chairs. The co-chairs began drafting their version of the plan; Stoltenberg stalled the plan through Norwegian diplomat (and ICFY ambassador) Kai Eide, creating a conflict between Eide and Galbraith.|$|E
40|$|The {{rationale}} for <b>local</b> fiscal <b>autonomy</b> suggests that <b>local</b> expenditure and local revenue generation {{should remain in}} close proximity. This is achieved through fiscal decentralisation to local government, to ensure efficient provision of local services that align with local needs, and to improve accountability to residents. Fiscal decentralisation has found resonance in developing countries through local government reforms, but in Africa fiscal decentralisation has been focussed mainly on revenue sharing, except {{in a few cases}} where some <b>local</b> fiscal <b>autonomy</b> has been achieved. Urbanisation in Africa is likely to continue (UN-Habitat, 2008), necessitating an increase in municipal service delivery which African cities must finance − hence the need for <b>local</b> fiscal <b>autonomy.</b> <b>Local</b> fiscal <b>autonomy</b> is arguably contentious for African cities, partly because provision of municipal services must be tempered with considerations of equity and redistribution to the poorer urban populations, and because inadequate welfare nets from national government do not subsidise the gap in municipal revenue. In the recent past, Kenya and South Africa adopted local government reforms in different forms that has yielded different forms of <b>local</b> fiscal <b>autonomy.</b> The paper conducts a comparative of <b>local</b> fiscal <b>autonomy</b> in municipal services provision in Nairobi and Johannesburg...|$|R

40|$|This thesis makes a {{comparative}} study of <b>local</b> government <b>autonomy</b> in Britain and Sweden within the local economic development policy area. It argues for <b>local</b> government <b>autonomy</b> to be viewed {{in terms of both}} a vertical dimension concerning <b>local</b> government's <b>autonomy</b> vis-à-vis national government (national context) and a horizontal dimension relating to its <b>autonomy</b> vis-à-vis <b>local</b> social and economic forces (local context). A policy area approach is advocated as the strength of, and the balance between, factors influencing <b>local</b> government <b>autonomy,</b> both vertically and horizontally, may be modified by the particular characteristics of the policy area. For example, the local economic development policy area is characterized as a grey zone respecting the intergovernmental relationship and a "mixed-economy" concerning the public-private sector relationship. The concept of autonomy is distinguished into policy-making independence (measured as local authority cooperation with other actors in economic development policies) and capacity for action (measured in terms of four local authority roles in the local economy). These are tested empirically regarding the influence of the local context and the relationship between them examined. The dominant trend in both countries is that the more local authorities intervene in the local economy (extend their capacity for action), the greater their cooperation with other actors (the more restricted their policy-making independence). digitalisering@um...|$|R
