50|$|The basic {{challenge}} facing WFP under P4P was to shape and manage {{a process that}} involved creating extra demand for staple food crops produced by smallholder farmers, reaching an appropriate <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> adapted to that demand, and ensuring that benefits accrued to the smallholder farmers. WFP succeeded in procuring over 367,000 metric tons (mt) of food over the five-year pilot, putting more than US$148 million more directly {{into the hands of}} smallholder farmers (US$30 million/year on average). Further, farmer organizations not previously selling collectively sold another US$60 million worth of quality food to buyers beyond WFP. Almost all P4P contracts were below import parity prices, therefore respecting WFP’s principle of “cost-efficient procurement” and realizing cost savings relative to importation. Compared to import parity, total savings {{over the course of the}} five years exceeded US$40 million. These outcomes hinged on several important investments. Novel partnerships and platforms was a necessity, along with a range of new products and services. In many important ways, therefore, WFP and its partners ventured into virgin territory under P4P. A core principal guiding the thoughts of the original designers was that the pilot’s “failures” would yield learnings and lessons at least as important as its “successes.” The charge to WFP was to think outside the box, innovate, and evolve, knowing that not everything attempted would work. This report provides a comprehensive view of key aspects of that experimentation and learning process, detailing the extraordinarily wide array of opportunities generated by the P4P approach, along with the correspondingly deep set of challenges addressed.|$|E

Therefore this thesis chose {{to focus on the}} <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> chain integration from manufacturing SMEs perspective. Nevertheless supply chain integration is not simple due to conflicting goal, which exists between supply chain partners. Based on previous knowledge, the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> chain integration is affected by conflicting goal, which exits between supply chain partners. We believe that this is based on how the conflicting goal has been managed. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to obtain an understanding if the level of integration in the automotive industry between the manufacturing SME and its customer is affected by how the conflicting has been managed. Method: This thesis is a multiple case study and was conducted with a deductive approach. The empirical findings were gathered through qualitative interviews with semi-structured interview guides. Conclusions: The conclusions of this thesis are that the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> chain integration, which exists between manufacturing SME and its customer, is low/medium. Furthermore, the conflicting goal, which exists between these partners, are that the demand of delivery and volume flexibility, storage flexibility, demand of quality level and the relatively high manufacturing complexity as well as downstream complexity. Finally, the result of this thesis shows that the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> chain integration is affected by how the conflicting goal has been managed...|$|E

To achieve this, {{it is suggested that}} Malaysian manufacturers especially SME should be involved in supply chain collaboration in their business operations. However, it is discovered that there are very few reported research on the supply chain collaboration activities among Malaysian SME manufacturers. The objective of this research is to uncover the supply chain collaboration activities among Malaysian SME manufacturers with their trading partners. This is to be done by determining the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> chain collaboration of Malaysian SME manufacturer and investigating the reason Malaysian SME manufacturers supply chain collaborations is at that level. In order to achieve the above objective, a mixed method of quantitative approach using survey method is employed to determine the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> chain collaboration and qualitative approach using personal interview method is employed to find out the reason for why Malaysian SME manufacturers’ supply chain collaboration is at that level. This research discovered that the supply chain collaboration of Malaysian SME manufactures with their trading partners is at minimal level.

On the other hand, Malaysian SME manufacturer are willing to have a high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> chain collaboration if long term business relationship could be established.
