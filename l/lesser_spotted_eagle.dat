40|$|ABSTRACT To date, {{most of the}} <b>Lesser</b> <b>Spotted</b> <b>Eagles</b> Aquila pomarina that we have {{tracked by}} {{satellite}} telemetry migrated in autumn along a direct route from Israel to Africa, via Suez (Egypt). In both 1997 and 1998, however, one adult female was tracked to {{the southern tip of}} the Sinai Peninsula, and from there flew north again to Suez. Only one other adult eagle is known to have flown south over the Sinai Peninsula, but from there crossed the Gulf of Suez. The possible reasons for this behaviour, involving a 500 -km detour and a flight of about three and a half days, are discussed. Satellite-tracked <b>Lesser</b> <b>Spotted</b> Eagl...|$|R
40|$|Greater and <b>lesser</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>eagles</b> (Aquila clanga, A. pomarina) are two {{closely related}} forest eagles {{overlapping}} in breeding range in east-central Europe. In recent years {{a number of}} mixed pairs have been observed, some of which fledged hybrid young. Here we use mitochondrial (control region) DNA sequences and AFLP markers to estimate genetic differentiation and possible gene flow between these species. In a sample of 83 individuals (61 pomarina, 20 clanga, 2 F 1 -hybrids) we found 30 mitochondrial haplotypes which, in a phylogenetic network, formed two distinct clusters differing on average by 3. 0 % sequence divergence. The two species were significantly differentiated both at the mitochondrial and nuclear (AFLP) genetic level. However, five individuals with pomarina phenotype possessed clanga-type mtDNA, suggesting occasional gene flow. Surprisingly, AFLP markers indicated that these "mismatched" birds (originating from Germany, E Poland and Latvia) were genetically intermediate between the samples of individuals in which mtDNA haplotype and phenotype agreed. This indicates that mismatched birds were either F 1 or recent back-cross hybrids. Mitochondrial introgression was asymmetrical (no pomarina haplotype found in clanga so far), which {{may be due to}} assortative mating by size. Gene flow of nuclear markers was estimated to be about ten times stronger than for mtDNA, indicating a sex-bias in hybrid fertility in accordance with Haldane's rule. Hybridization between the two species may be more frequent and may occur much further west than hitherto assumed. This is supported by the recent discovery of a mixed pair producing at least one fledgling in NE Germany...|$|R
40|$|Aims Different {{aspects of}} soaring-bird {{migration}} {{are influenced by}} weather. However, the relationship between weather and the onset of soaring-bird migration, particularly in autumn, is not clear. Although long-term migration counts are often unavailable near the breeding areas of many soaring birds in the western Palaearctic, soaring-bird migration has been systematically monitored in Israel, a region where populations from large geographical areas converge. This study tests several fundamental hypotheses regarding the onset of migration and explores the connection between weather, migration onset and arrival at a distant site. Location Globally gridded meteorological data from the breeding areas in north-eastern Europe were used as predictive variables {{in relation to the}} arrival of soaring migrants in Israel. Methods Inverse modelling was used to study the temporal and spatial influence of weather on initiation of migration based on autumn soaring-bird migration counts in Israel. Numerous combinations of migration duration and temporal influence of meteorological variables (temperature, sea-level pressure and precipitable water) were tested with different models for meteorological sensitivity. Results The day of arrival in Israel of white storks, honey buzzards, Levant sparrowhawks and <b>lesser</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>eagles</b> was significantly and strongly related to meteorological conditions in the breeding area days or even weeks before arrival in Israel. The cumulative number of days or cumulative value above or below a meteorological threshold performed significantly better than other models tested. Models provided reliable estimates of migration duration for each species. Main conclusions The meteorological triggers of migration at the breeding grounds differed between species and were related to deteriorating living conditions and deteriorating migratory flight conditions. Soaring birds are sensitive to meteorological triggers at the same period every year and their temporal response to weather appears to be constrained by their annual routine...|$|R
2500|$|Generally speaking, {{there appears}} to be rather {{strictly}} adhered size hierarchy among birds of prey and the very largest raptorial prey attacked by Eurasian eagle-owl tend to roughly equal to their own size. Larger raptors, such as eagles and vultures, seem to be largely invulnerable to eagle-owls. However, in Scandinavia, there are two cases of eagle-owls preying on “fairly large” nestlings of white-tailed eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla). Given the size, average adult weight of , and formidable character of this eagle, {{it is possible that the}} young of other raptors larger than themselves may too be attacked. Eastern imperial eagles (Aquila heliaca), which are nearly as large as the white-tailed eagle at an average weight of , have been killed by eagle-owls in Kazakhstan. Remarkable, considering the greater threat that the eagle normally poses to the eagle-owl than vica versa, it appeared a golden eagle was amongst the prey remains found around a nest in the French Pyrenees. Cases in Spain where large, formidable birds of prey, the Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) and Bonelli's eagle, that are roughly equal in size to the eagle-owls, both weighing just over , have been predated, these seem to be taken from the nest or shortly after independence and rare occurrences. However, in Turkey, the eagle-owl is apparently a regular and serious predator of Bonelli's eagles. The Eurasian eagle-owl predates the largest members of the most species-rich diurnal raptor genera: the [...] northern goshawks from the Accipiter genus, the [...] upland buzzards from the Buteo genus and the [...] gyrfalcons (F. rusticolus) of the Falco genus. Additional large raptors, i.e. those that can average [...] or more in body mass, taken as prey include [...] osprey (Pandion haliaetus), the [...] red kites (Milvus milvus), [...] short-toed eagles (Circaetus gallicus), the [...] greater spotted eagle (Clanga clanga), the [...] <b>lesser</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>eagle</b> (Clanga pomarina), and the rough-legged buzzards (Buteo lagopus) and saker falcons (Falco cherrug), in both of which females average more than [...] The taking of rough-legged buzzards and snowy owls must be confined to full-grown victims, since they nest further north than Eurasian eagle-owls. Eurasian eagle-owls also hunt the smallest raptors available, including those such as lesser kestrels (Falco naumanni) and Japanese sparrowhawks (Accipiter gularis) that weigh less than [...] Some of these are cases of eagle-owls killing nestlings or fledglings but they can easily overtake adult buzzards, goshawks and falcons of any size.|$|E
