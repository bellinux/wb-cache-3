As {{a part of this}} change, the Co-op was also the first to introduce a graphic on the front of all own-brand products which highlighted the key nutritional information. The choice of the word [...] "salt" [...] over [...] "sodium" [...] was made because their research suggested that most consumers did not understand {{the difference between the two}} words and hence significantly underestimated the salt content of processed foods. Because of this, the Co-op also called for the government to legislate so that salt rather than sodium should be displayed on the packing of products.|$|E

This cross-sectional, randomised and controlled parallel-group trial was conducted in Brazil in 2013. 313 university students were randomly assigned to one of three parallel groups with different menu labelling formats. Of these, data from 233 students were analysed. The others did not attend and were excluded. Intervention group 1 (n= 88) received information in the form of a traffic light system plus guideline daily amounts, while intervention group 2 (n= 74) was presented with an ingredients list plus highlighted symbols. The control group (n= 71) received a menu with no menu labelling. Data were collected on one weekday in a restaurant setting. Trial outcomes were assessed by healthy food choices. Healthy food choices were significantly higher among students who received the menu showing an ingredients list plus highlighted symbols. The same menu <b>labelling</b> <b>format</b> positively affected healthy food choices in women, not overweight participants and who often ate out more than twice a week.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate consumers’ knowledge of health risks of high salt intake and frequency of use and understanding of labelled salt information. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in shopping centres within Metropolitan Melbourne. A sample of 493 subjects was recruited. The questionnaire assessed salt related shopping behaviours, attitudes to salt intake and health and their ability to interpret labelled sodium information. Four hundred and seventy four valid surveys were collected (65 % female, 64 % being the main shopper). Most participants knew of the relationship between salt intake and high blood pressure (88 %). Sixty five percent of participants were unable to correctly identify the relationship between salt and sodium. Sixty nine percent reported reading the salt content of food products when shopping. Salt label usage was significantly related to shoppers concern about the amount of salt in their diet and the belief that their health could improve by lowering salt intake. Approximately half of the sample was unable to accurately use labelled sodium information to pick low salt options. Raising consumer awareness of the health risks associated with high salt consumption may increase salt label usage and purchases of low salt foods. However, for food labels to be effective in helping consumers select low salt foods a more ‘user friendly’ <b>labelling</b> <b>format</b> is needed. <br /...|$|E

This study examined changes to consumer food purchases after the introduction of traffic-light labels with the aim of assessing the impact of the labels on the ‘healthiness’ of foods purchased. The study examined sales data from a major UK retailer in 2007. We analysed products in two categories (‘ready meals’ and sandwiches), investigating the percentage change in sales 4 weeks before and after traffic-light labels were introduced, and taking into account seasonality, product promotions and product life-cycle. We investigated whether changes in sales were related to the healthiness of products. All products that were not new and not on promotion immediately before or after the introduction of traffic-light labels were selected for the analysis (n = 6 for ready meals and n = 12 for sandwiches). For the selected ready-meals, sales increased (by 2. 4 % of category sales) in the 4 weeks after the introduction of traffic-light labels, whereas sales of the selected sandwiches did not change significantly. Critically, there was no association between changes in product sales and the healthiness of the products.

40|$|The {{placement}} of nutrition {{information on the}} front of food packages has been proposed as a method of providing simplified and visible nutrition information. This study aimed to determine the most acceptable and effective front-of-pack food labelling system for Australian consumers. Consumers' preferences and ability to compare the healthiness of mock food products were assessed for different front-of-pack labelling systems. Four systems were tested, including two variations of the Percentage Daily Intake system (Monochrome %DI and Colour-Coded %DI), which displays the proportion of daily nutrient contribution that a serve of food provides; and two variations of the Traffic Light (TL) system (Traffic Light and Traffic Light + Overall Rating), which uses colour-coding to indicate nutrient levels. Intercept surveys with 790 consumers were conducted, where each participant was exposed to a single labelling system for performance testing. Participants indicated strong support for the inclusion of nutrient information on total fat, saturated fat, sugar and sodium {{on the front of}} packages, and a consistent <b>labelling</b> <b>format</b> across all products. Using the TL system, participants were five times more likely to identify healthier foods compared with the Monochrome %DI system [odds ratio (OR) = 5. 18; p < 0. 001], and three times more likely compared with the Colour-Coded %DI system (OR = 3. 01; p < 0. 05). Consumers supported the introduction of consistent front-of-pack food labelling. The TL system was the most effective in assisting consumers to identify healthier foods. Mandatory TL labelling regulations are recommended to assist consumers in making healthy food choices. © The Author (2009). Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

40|$|Background: In recent years, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has {{proposed}} implementing a standardized over-the-counter (OTC) medicine label. However, there were mixed consumer opinions regarding a label proposed in 2012 and limited evidence demonstrating the usability of the revised (2014) format. Objective: To develop {{and examine the}} usability of alternative OTC medicine <b>label</b> <b>formats</b> for standardization, and explore consumer perspectives on the labels. Materials and methods: Four alternative labels were developed for the exemplar medicine diclofenac. One {{was based on the}} Medicine Information label proposed by the TGA (‘Medicine Information’), one was based on the U. S. Drug Facts label (‘Drug Facts’), and two were based on suggestions proposed by consumers in the earlier needs analysis phase of this research (referred to as the ‘Medicine Facts’ and ‘Consumer Desires’ <b>label</b> <b>formats).</b> Five cohorts of 10 participants were recruited. Each cohort was assigned to user test one of the alternative labels or an existing label for a proprietary diclofenac product (which acted as a comparator) for diagnostic purposes. Each participant then provided feedback on all 5 labels. Each interview consisted of the administration of a user testing questionnaire, measuring consumers’ ability to find and understand key points of information, and a semi-structured interview exploring consumer perspectives. Results: Overall, all 4 alternative <b>label</b> <b>formats</b> supported consumers’ ability to find and understand key points. The existing comparator label was the poorer label with respect to participants’ ability to find and understand key points. Factors such as perceived usability, color, design, content, and/or content ordering impacted consumer preferences. The ‘Consumer Desires’ or ‘Drug Facts’ <b>label</b> <b>formats</b> were most often preferred by consumers for use as the standardized OTC label over the TGA proposed format. Conclusions: All alternative <b>label</b> <b>formats</b> demonstrated satisfactory usability and could be considered for use in OTC label standardization.

The difference was particularly evident when the data were analyzed for overall total correct responses. Participants who were high school graduates or had family incomes between $ 4, 000 - $ 7, 999 made more correct responses when utilizing the nutrient density format than when confronted with the other format.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Nutrition {{labels are}} a {{potentially}} valuable tool to assist consumers in making healthy food choices. Front-of-pack labels are {{a relatively new}} format and are now widely used across many European countries, but it is unclear which of the many formats in use are best understood by consumers. It is also unclear whether the existence of multiple formats impedes understanding and use. This article addresses this question with findings from a study commissioned by the UK Food Standards Agency to provide evidence to inform policy decisions in this area. METHODS: In-depth qualitative interviews were used to explore consumers' decision-making processes when using two different front-of-pack <b>label</b> <b>formats</b> to judge the relative healthiness {{of a pair of}} products. Participants were presented with product pairs differently labelled and a series of structured prompts were used to access their internal dialogues and to identify any difficulties encountered. RESULTS: The interviews revealed that making product comparisons using different <b>label</b> <b>formats</b> was challenging for participants and particularly for those product pairs where there was not an obvious answer. When the <b>label</b> <b>formats</b> on the product pairs lacked a common element, such as text, this also caused difficulties and misinterpretation. The comparisons also took time and effort that would be a deterrent in real-life situations. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the existence of multiple front-of-pack <b>label</b> <b>formats</b> in the marketplace may impede consumer comprehension and discourage use. They suggest that a single format may encourage consumers to use front-of-pack labels in making healthy food choices...|$|R

The 100 undergraduate students who participated in this study were {{randomly assigned to one of}} six conditions. The first independent variable was the healthiness of the snack, featuring a healthy snack or a less healthy snack. The second independent variable was the label type on the package, consisting of the dual-column label, single-column <b>label,</b> and no-label <b>formats.</b> The dual-column <b>label</b> <b>format</b> contains both single- serving nutritional information as well as entire-package nutritional information, while the single-column nutrition fact label contains only single-serving nutritional information. The study involved five dependent variables: 1) comprehension level; 2) characteristic awareness level; 3) level of motivation to process the labels in the single-column and dual-column label conditions; 4) nutrition fact <b>label</b> <b>format</b> favorability; and 5) dietary choice. Each participant received a bag containing a snack as well as a questionnaire that contained a copy of the nutrition fact label from the snack. In addition, the participants were given a series of questions regarding the snacks??? nutritional information presented on the labels, and they were instructed to pay attention to the nutrition fact labels to fill out the questionnaire. After this initial exercise, the participants watched a short comedy video clip and proceeded to answer the post-test questionnaire. As was hypothesized, the dual-column nutrition label performed significantly better in terms of accurately estimating calorie and protein counts compared to those with the single-column and the no-label formats. However, the use of dual-column labels was not effective in terms of helping the participants to estimate accurate serving sizes or fat and fiber counts; thus, these findings did not support the hypothesis. In addition, unlike the initial hypothesis, the dual-column arrangement did not have a significant effect in reference to increasing the level of motivation of participants to evaluate the labels. In addition, the participants who were given the dual-column label did not eat a significantly smaller amount of snacks compared to the participants with the other <b>label</b> <b>formats.</b> The results in the current study suggest that the dual-column <b>label</b> <b>format,</b> which supplies good situational cues, is partially effective in the estimation of nutritional content but failed to show effectiveness in other areas.
