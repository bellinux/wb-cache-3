40|$|Atmosphere <b>light</b> <b>value</b> is {{a highly}} {{critical}} parameter in defogging algorithms {{that are based on}} an atmosphere scattering model. Any error in atmosphere <b>light</b> <b>value</b> will produce a direct impact on the accuracy of scattering computation and thus bring chromatic distortion to restored images. To address this problem, this paper propose a method that relies on clustering statistics to estimate atmosphere <b>light</b> <b>value.</b> It starts by selecting in the original image some potential atmosphere light source points, which are grouped into point clusters by means of clustering technique. From these clusters, a number of clusters containing candidate atmosphere light source points are selected, the points are then analyzed statistically, and the cluster containing the most candidate points is used for estimating atmosphere <b>light</b> <b>value.</b> The mean brightness vector of the candidate atmosphere light points in the chosen point cluster is taken as the estimate of atmosphere <b>light</b> <b>value,</b> while their geometric center in the image is accepted as the location of atmosphere light. Experimental results suggest that this statistics clustering method produces more accurate atmosphere brightness vectors and light source locations. This accuracy translates to, from a subjective perspective, more natural defogging effect {{on the one hand and}} to the improvement in various objective image quality indicators on the other hand...|$|R

40|$|In this article, {{we discuss}} methods for {{analysis}} of distribution <b>valued</b> <b>data</b> {{as a kind of}} symbolic data. Most methods for data analysis assume that the data are sets of numbers with structure. For example, typical multivariate data are identified as a set of n vectors of real numbers and dissimilarity data on pairs of n objects are as matrix. However, requests {{for analysis of}} data with new models become higher, as the kind and quantity of the data is increased. In order to overcome this problem, Symbolic Data Analysis (SDA) supplies various <b>data</b> descriptions; interval <b>valued</b> <b>data,</b> modal interval data, categorical <b>data,</b> distribution <b>valued</b> <b>data,</b> etc. Distribution <b>valued</b> <b>data</b> is fruitful because of its ability of expression. An approach to analyze distribution <b>valued</b> <b>data</b> is the use of functions (density function, cumulative distribution function, quantile function etc.) We focus on quantile functions to describe the objects or data. Another great approach to deal with such complex data is Functional Data Analysis (FDA.) In FDA, the objects or data are described by functions. Then we can use techniques of FDA to analyze the quantile functions. We introduce methods of clustering and multidimensional scaling (MDS) for distribution <b>valued</b> <b>data</b> and related topics...|$|R

50|$|There are {{a number}} of shading {{algorithms}} for rasterizers. All shading algorithms need to account for distance from light and the normal vector of the shaded object with respect to the incident direction of light. The fastest algorithms simply shade all pixels on any given triangle with a single <b>lighting</b> <b>value,</b> also known as flat shading. There is no way to create the illusion of smooth surfaces this way, except by subdividing into many small triangles. Algorithms can also separately shade vertices, and interpolate the <b>lighting</b> <b>value</b> of the vertices when drawing pixels. This is known as Gouraud shading. The slowest and most realistic approach is to calculate lighting separately for each pixel, also known as Phong shading. This performs bilinear interpolation of the normal vectors and uses the result to do local lighting calculation.|$|R
