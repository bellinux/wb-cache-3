Research shows us that progressive sanctions in the form of demerit points systems have a positive road safety effect with a duration of up to 1. 5 years. The road safety effect of progressive (financial) fines has not as such been investigated in the Netherlands nor in other countries. A scenario analysis indicates that a <b>progressive</b> fines <b>system</b> could save 5 % of the road deaths per year. Research shows that there is considerable public support for the introduction of a general demerit points system; citizens and experts also seem to support a <b>progressive</b> fines <b>system.</b> On 20 June 2017 the Minister of of Security and Justice in the Netherlands has announced to investigate the possibility to introduce a <b>progressive</b> fines <b>system</b> on licence plate.

40|$|Progressive and {{approximate}} {{techniques are}} proposed here for ray-tracing systems {{used to predict}} ra-dio propagation. In a <b>progressive</b> prediction <b>system,</b> intermediate prediction results are fed back to users continuously. As more raypaths are processed, the accuracy of prediction results improves progressively. We consider how to construct a <b>progressive</b> <b>system</b> that satisfies the requirements of continuous observ-ability and controllability as well as faithfulness and fairness. Adding a workload estimator to such a <b>progressive</b> prediction <b>system</b> allows termination of the computation when a desired accuracy (mean and standard deviation of the error) is achieved without knowing the final result that would be obtained if the prediction system runs to completion. The sample generator {{is at the core}} of the <b>progressive</b> prediction <b>system</b> and serves to cluster and pri-oritize raypaths according to their expected contributions to prediction results. Two types of progressive approaches, source-group-raypath-permute and raypath-interleave, are proposed. The workload estima-tor determines the number of raypaths to be processed to achieve the specified requirement on prediction accuracy. Two approximate models are described that adjust the workload dynamically during the pre-diction process. Our experiments show that the proposed progressive and approximate methods provid...|$|R

40|$|Different tax systems, {{and their}} impact on work {{motivation}} and tax compliance are significant issues in contemporary political and economic debates. The proportional feature of a flat tax system is assumed to lead to higher performance, while the fairness of the redistributive <b>progressive</b> tax <b>system</b> is assumed to result in higher tax compliance. However, empirical findings on the topic are inconclusive. Both work performance and tax compliance under different tax systems were examined in an experiment, with special attention devoted to the effect of a change in tax systems. A flat tax system was supposed to induce greater work performance, whereas a <b>progressive</b> tax <b>system</b> was expected to increase tax compliance based on fairness perceptions, allowing for the opposite effect due to higher complexity. Furthermore, it was assumed that performance and tax payments would be influenced by motives of self-interest. The design included 20 rounds with a real-effort task in each round, determining participants' experimental income. Participants (N = 191) made decisions about their tax payments from round-to-round in four different experimental conditions: (1) a flat tax <b>system,</b> (2) a <b>progressive</b> tax <b>system,</b> (3) starting with a flat and changing to a progressive, and (4) starting with a progressive and changing to a flat tax system. Results indicate higher work performance in a <b>progressive</b> <b>system.</b> However, a change from a <b>progressive</b> tax <b>system</b> to a flat system led to increased tax compliance.
