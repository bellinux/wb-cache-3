When the battle commenced he insisted on making the charge with the rest, but collapsed within a short distance. His last words, according to Herodotus, were, [...] "I grieve not because I have to die for my country, but because I have not <b>lifted</b> <b>my</b> arm against the enemy." ...|$|E

Then something happened that to this day I still cannot get over. He asked me to bend down and touch my toes.

500|$|In December 1864, the {{dictator}} of Paraguay, Francisco Solano López, ordered {{an invasion of}} the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso (currently the state of Mato Grosso do Sul), triggering the Paraguayan War. Four months later, Paraguayan troops invaded Argentine territory in preparation for an attack on Rio Grande do Sul. The invasions resulted in an alliance between Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. Following the resignation of Caxias's government in 1862, successor cabinets were headed by the Progressive League, the rival of the Conservative Party. As a Conservative, Joaquim Inácio found himself largely sidelined. He humorously commented that the Progressives [...] "have not <b>lifted</b> <b>my</b> excommunication by giving me a better ration of soup , thus I shall remain on a diet". In October 1865, Joaquim Inácio {{was sent to the}} north of Brazil, charged with recruiting volunteers, but soon resigned that commission and opted to devote his time to the Holy House of Mercy.|$|E

2500|$|The motif {{was based}} on a statue of Isis in the Egyptian city of Sais {{mentioned}} by the Greco-Roman authors Plutarch and Proclus. They claimed the statue bore an inscription saying [...] "I am all that has been and is and shall be; and no mortal has ever <b>lifted</b> <b>my</b> mantle." [...] Illustrations of Isis with her veil being lifted were popular from the late 17th to the early 19th century, often as allegorical representations of Enlightenment science and philosophy uncovering nature's secrets. Authors {{at the end of the}} 18th century, foreshadowing the Romantic movement, began using the lifting of Isis's veil as a metaphor for revealing awe-inspiring truth. Helena Blavatsky, in Isis Unveiled in 1877, used the metaphor for the spiritual truths that her Theosophical belief system hoped to discover, and modern ceremonial magic includes a ritual called the Rending of the Veil to bring the magician to a higher state of spiritual awareness.|$|E

Kelly recalled seeing a Tendrils' gig when [...] "Charlie played a strange, harsh run of notes that seemed wrong to me at first. But when I heard them a second time, a verse or two later, they <b>lifted</b> <b>my</b> head clean off my shoulders". Kelly played the track for Owen backstage in Bendigo after a gig where Owen and Maurice Frawley had performed as a duo {{and they had been}} followed on stage by Kelly and Spencer P. Jones, also as a duo. While Kelly played the newly written song, Owen mistakenly believed they were [...] "just sitting around making up lyrics and stuff ... they're taking the piss out of me, the pricks". Days later Owen had the situation clarified and later acknowledged that he was [...] "flattered and touched" [...] by Kelly's tribute.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{mention of}} the veil of Isis appears in On Isis and Osiris, a {{philosophical}} interpretation of ancient Egyptian religion by Plutarch, a Greek writer in the late first and early second centuries CE. Plutarch wrote of a seated statue of a goddess in the Egyptian city of Sais that bore the inscription [...] "I am all that has been and is and shall be; and no mortal has ever <b>lifted</b> <b>my</b> mantle." [...] Plutarch identified the goddess as [...] "Athena, whom [...] consider to be Isis." [...] Sais was the cult center of the goddess Neith, whom the Greeks compared to their goddess Athena and was thus the goddess that Plutarch spoke of. In Plutarch's time Isis was the preeminent goddess in Egyptian religion and was frequently syncretized with Neith, which is why Plutarch equated the two. More than 300 years after Plutarch, the Neoplatonist philosopher Proclus wrote of the same statue in Book I of his Commentaries on Plato's [...] "Timaeus". In this version, [...] "no mortal" [...] is replaced by [...] "no one" [...] and a third statement is added: [...] "The fruit of my womb was the sun".|$|E
2500|$|Opas in {{defending}} Ryan {{put a lot}} of pressure on a warder who made conflicting statements, Paterson had made several mutually contradictory statements to police about what he saw, heard and did on that day. In his first statement given to Detective Sergeant Carton on 19 December 1965 Paterson said; [...] "I did not hear a shot fired other than the one I fired." [...] In a second statement given to Senior Detective Morrison on 12 January 1966 Paterson said; [...] "Just as I turned into the entrance to the garden I heard a shot." [...] In a third statement on 3 February 1966 Paterson said; [...] "I ran back inside and asked for a gun, I went to the main gate and I received a gun and ran back outside, as I was running on to the lawn I heard the crack of a shot." [...] Paterson changed his story, too, about who was in the line of fire when he aimed his rifle. In his first statement Paterson said; [...] "I sighted my rifle at Ryan and was about to fire when a woman walked into the line of fire and I <b>lifted</b> <b>my</b> rifle." [...] In his second statement Paterson said; [...] "I took aim at Ryan but two prison officers were in the line of fire so I dropped my rifle again." [...] In his third statement Paterson said; [...] "I took aim at Ryan and I found out I had to fire between two prison officers to get Ryan, so I lowered my gun again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Proclus {{said the}} statue {{was in the}} adyton of a temple at Sais, but the inner areas of Egyptian temples were not {{accessible}} to anyone but priests, and {{it is unlikely that}} a statue of a deity would have been permanently veiled; priests saw the cult image of the god every day when performing temple rites. However, a statue in a temple's courtyards or halls could have borne an inscription similar to the one Plutarch and Proclus related. The first part of the inscription—"I am all that has been and is and shall be"—means the goddess encompasses everything. This claim was commonly made of creator gods such as Ra or Amun in Egyptian religion; if the same was said about Isis, it reflected her increased status in Greco-Roman times, in which she was often said to be the creator of the world. The second part—"no one has ever <b>lifted</b> <b>my</b> mantle"—implies that the goddess was virginal, a claim that was occasionally made of Isis in Greco-Roman times but conflicted with the long-standing belief {{that she and her husband}} Osiris conceived their son Horus. Proclus's version suggests that the goddess conceived and gave birth to the sun without the participation of a male deity, which would reflect Egyptian myths about Neith as the mother of the sun god Ra. Another possible explanation, suggested by the Egyptologist Jan Assmann, is that the latter part of the Egyptian inscription said [...] "There is nobody except me", proclaiming that the all-encompassing goddess was unique, and was mistranslated into Greek as [...] "there is nobody who opened [...] my face." ...|$|E
