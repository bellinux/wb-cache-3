5|$|A {{study by}} Eric Snively and Anthony P. Russel {{published}} in 2003 {{also found that}} the tyrannosaurid arctometatarsals and elastic ligaments worked together in what he called a 'tensile keystone model' to strengthen the feet of Tyrannosaurus, increase the animal's stability and add greater resistance to dissociation over that of other theropod families; while still allowing resiliency that is otherwise reduced in ratites, horses, giraffids and other animals with metapodia to a single element. The study also pointed out that elastic ligaments in larger vertebrates could store and return relatively more elastic strain energy, which could have improved locomotor efficiency and decrease the strain energy transferred to the bones. The study suggested that this mechanism could have worked efficiently in tyrannosaurids as well. Hence, the study involved identifying the type of ligaments attached to the metatarsals, then how they functioned together and comparing it to those of other theropods and modern day analogs. The scientists found that arctometatarsals may have enabled tyrannosaurid feet to absorb forces such as linear deceleration, <b>lateral</b> <b>acceleration</b> and torsion more effectively than those of other theropods. It is also stated in their study that this may imply, though not demonstrate, that tyrannosaurids such as Tyrannosaurus had greater agility than other large theropods without an arctometatarsus.|$|E

40|$|A brief {{literature}} {{review of the}} general subject of projectile penetration into soil media is presented. Particular {{emphasis is placed on}} projectiles impacting soil targets at other than normal incidence and/or at an angle of attack, for which <b>lateral</b> <b>accelerations</b> exist and can dominate the structural response. Comparisons of predicted <b>lateral</b> <b>accelerations</b> with recent earth penetrator experiments are then made using a 3 degree-of-freedom rigid-body approach developed elsewhere to determine the external penetrator loading. Agreement between experimental and calculated accelerations is favorable, but the need to include flexible-body response is indicated. Finally a scheme to incorporate a spherical-cavity-expansion analytical procedure into a detailed finite element model of the penetrator is developed to account for flexible-body response...|$|R
30|$|As expected, due to {{the track}} {{stiffness}} variation, the vertical and <b>lateral</b> <b>accelerations</b> have been modified. However, this difference is lower than 9  % in all cases. These variations are considered perfectly acceptable, and therefore, the model is finally calibrated and validated.|$|R
30|$|Figure  9, {{for high}} {{curvature}} low speed scenarios, looks noticeably asymmetric, due to asymmetry {{of the test}} track and due {{to the presence of}} roundabouts. In Fig.  9, positive <b>lateral</b> <b>accelerations</b> mean leftwards curves, and roundabouts are all leftwards. In particular, the island {{in the middle of the}} right half of the chart centered at ~ 2.5  m/s 2 is caused by roundabouts.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{explains}} {{the effect of}} a motion platform for driving simulators on postural instability and head vibration exposure. The sensed head level-vehicle (visual cues) level longitudinal and <b>lateral</b> <b>accelerations</b> (ax,sensed=ax_head and ay,sensed=ay_head, ayv=ay_veh and ayv=ay_veh) were saved by using a motion tracking sensor and a simulation software respectively. Then, associated vibration dose values (VDVs) were computed at head level during the driving sessions. Furthermore, the postural instabilities of the participants were measured as longitudinal and lateral subject body centre of pressure (XCP and YCP, respectively) displacements just after each driving session via a balance platform. The results revealed that the optic-head inertial level longitudinal accelerations indicated a negative non-significant correlation (r=−. 203, p=. 154 >. 05) for the static case, whereas the optic-head inertial longitudinal accelerations depicted a so small negative non-significant correlation (r=−. 066, p=. 643 >. 05) that can be negligible for the dynamic condition. The XCP for the dynamic case indicated a significant higher value than the static situation (t(47), p<. 0001). The VDVx for the dynamic case yielded a significant higher value than the static situation (U(47), p<. 0001). The optic-head inertial <b>lateral</b> <b>accelerations</b> resulted a negative significant correlation (r=−. 376, p=. 007 <. 05) for the static platform, whereas the optic-head inertial <b>lateral</b> <b>accelerations</b> showed a positive significant correlation (r=. 418, p=. 002 <. 05) at dynamic platform condition. The VDVy for the static case indicated a significant higher value rather than the dynamic situation (U(47), p<. 0001). The YCP for the static case yielded significantly higher than the dynamic situation (t(47), p=. 001 < 0. 05) ...|$|R
30|$|The {{mushroom}} cap, from − 0.5  m/s 2 to 2  m/s 2 longitudinal acceleration, {{occurs when}} the accelerator is used and brake is not. In this modality, longitudinal accelerations are combined with much higher <b>lateral</b> <b>accelerations,</b> up to about 4  m/s 2, especially in roundabouts. During 99.9  % of driving in these conditions, accelerator is used in combination with steering, unlike braking, which as said occurs without significant steering.|$|R
50|$|Roller coaster design {{requires}} a {{working knowledge of}} basic physics to avoid uncomfortable, even potentially fatal, strain to the rider. Ride designers must carefully ensure the accelerations experienced throughout the ride do not subject the human body to more than it can handle. The human body needs time to detect changes in force {{in order to control}} muscle tension. Failure to take this into account can result in severe injuries such as whiplash. The accelerations accepted in roller coaster design are generally in the 4-6Gs (40-60 m s−2) range for positive vertical (pushing you into your seat), and 1.5-2Gs (15-20 m s−2) for the negative vertical (flying out of your seat as you crest a hill). This range safely ensures {{the majority of the population}} experiences no harmful side effects. <b>Lateral</b> <b>accelerations</b> are generally kept to a minimum by banking curves. The neck's inability to deal with high forces leads to <b>lateral</b> <b>accelerations</b> generally limited to under 1.8Gs. Sudden <b>accelerations</b> in the <b>lateral</b> plane result in a rough ride.|$|R
25|$|Patrick Depailler {{was killed}} in , {{probably}} due to high <b>lateral</b> <b>acceleration</b> causing a black out in Hockenheim's fast Ostkurve. The double blow struck to Ferrari in , {{of the death of}} Gilles Villeneuve and the crippling injury to teammate Didier Pironi only a few weeks later, helped bring this crisis into the spotlight, and helped both sides settle the dispute {{for the good of the}} sport.|$|E
25|$|On May 19, 2006, Disney began {{offering}} a less intense version of Mission: Space (called Green Team, {{also known as}} Less Intense training or no spinning), where the centrifuge does not spin, thus eliminating the forces of <b>lateral</b> <b>acceleration</b> for riders who choose the more tame experience. The cabs themselves still pitch and pivot, providing some motion. The normal ride is still available and is called Orange Team (also known as More Intense training or spinning).|$|E
25|$|ESC {{is built}} {{on top of an}} {{anti-lock}} brake system, and all ESC-equipped vehicles are fitted with traction control. The ESC components include a yaw rate sensor, a <b>lateral</b> <b>acceleration</b> sensor, a steering wheel sensor, and an upgraded integrated control unit. In the US, Federal regulations require that ESC be installed as a standard feature on all passenger cars and light trucks as of the 2012 model year. According to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration research, ABS in 2005 cost an estimated US$368; ESC cost a further US$111. The retail price of ESC varies; as a stand-alone option it retails for as little as $250 USD. ESC was once rarely offered as a sole option, and was generally not available for aftermarket installation. Instead, it was frequently bundled with other features or more expensive trims, so the cost of a package that included ESC was several thousand dollars. Nonetheless, ESC is considered highly cost-effective and it might pay for itself in reduced insurance premiums.|$|E

The trajectory planning is done with a third-order system of differential equations using the drag and <b>lateral</b> <b>accelerations</b> as intermediate controls. The reduced-order planning problem is solved as an optimal control problem. The state and control variables {{not involved in the}} planning are computed in a second step...|$|R

500|$|The {{cars were}} {{modified}} BT46s—chassis numbers BT46/4 and BT46/6. Modifications {{to implement the}} fan concept were quite extensive—involving sealing the engine bay as well as adding the clutch system and the fan. They were designed and tested in some secrecy. Brabham's lead driver, Niki Lauda, realised he had to adjust his driving style, mostly for cornering. He found that if he accelerated around corners, the car would [...] "stick" [...] to the road {{as if it were}} on rails. This had the side effect of exposing the driver to very high <b>lateral</b> <b>acceleration,</b> which would become a major problem in the ground effect era. In his autobiography, Lauda described the car as being unpleasant to drive due to the lateral loads and reliance on aerodynamics over driver skill. He realised early on that the rate of ground effect development meant that in the future, every driver would be exposed to such g-loading while behind the wheel of such a car, and the physical effort needed to drive the cars would leave the drivers exhausted {{by the end of the}} races.|$|E

The purpose of the Beta-vane system is to reduce acceleration levels at the dutch roll frequency whereas the function of the MSAS system is to reduce accelerations due to flexible body motions caused by turbulence.

40|$|Abstract: A {{new class}} of {{guidance}} laws is developed {{on the basis of}} the Lyapunov method. The proposed new guidance laws improve the effectiveness of the proportional navigation (PN) law against manoeuvring targets. They augment the PN law which is a part of these laws. Analytical expressions of the new guidance laws for the generalized three-dimensional engagement model are presented. By considering separately the missile longitudinal and lateral motions, the expressions for its radial and <b>lateral</b> <b>accelerations</b> are obtained. The new guidance laws can be utilized for missiles with thrust control as well as for many types of existing missile without throttlable engines...|$|R

2500|$|ARPA began researching such {{a system}} under the name Hardpoint. To ensure they shot only at valid targets, it had to {{generate}} very accurate tracks for the enemy warheads. They also had only seconds to develop that track and launch a missile, assuming that that air would be filled with nuclear explosions that would render higher altitudes opaque to radar, an effect known as nuclear blackout. They began {{development of a new}} radar known as the Hardpoint Demonstration Array Radar, or HAPDAR, and a new extremely high-speed missile known as HIBEX. The entire engagement would last just over two seconds, with the intercept taking place at about [...] altitude.

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to most other battery electric vehicles including the Roadster, the battery pack of the Model S forms {{the floor of}} the vehicle between the axles, providing the vehicle with several advantages. Most notably, since the battery pack is the heaviest component of the vehicle, the Model S has a center of gravity height of only [...] (about the same as a Lotus Elise), helping it to achieve a <b>lateral</b> <b>acceleration</b> of 0.9g and good protection against rollover. Secondly, the absence of a heavy engine between the front or rear axle allows the bulk of the mass to be centralized between the axles, lowering rotational inertia allowing it to turn more quickly for its weight. Thirdly, the placement of the battery pack increases the rigidity of the passenger compartment, improving the passive safety of the vehicle. Fourth, placing the battery pack under the vehicle makes it possible to remove or replace the entire unit in 90 seconds, either for maintenance or for Tesla's Battery Swap service.|$|E
