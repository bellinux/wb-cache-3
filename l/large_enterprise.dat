It suggests that regional collaboration (local buzz) in particular will induce value creation if combined with international collaboration (global pipelines). Here, we analyze national data from Norway {{and find that}} both regional and international collaboration can foster product innovation. However, for medium-sized enterprises, we only found a substitution effect from combining regional and international collaboration. For small enterprises, {{there was even a}} subtractive effect. For <b>large</b> <b>enterprises,</b> we found an additive effect, and for very <b>large</b> <b>enterprises,</b> there was a multiplicative effect. It thus appears that <b>large</b> <b>enterprises</b> have an increased absorptive capacity in handling both regional and international collaboration. We conclude that the local buzz and global pipelines proposition is rejected for small and medium-sized enterprises, and gains partial to full support for large and very <b>large</b> <b>enterprises...</b>|$|R

30|$|In a {{comparative}} study based in Tokyo, Yoshino and Taghizadeh-Hesary (2016) {{explained that the}} differences are mainly; higher transaction costs relative to <b>large</b> <b>enterprises,</b> inability to compete against larger firms in terms of R&D expenditure and innovation, increased market competition and concentration from <b>large</b> <b>enterprises</b> caused by globalization and economic integration, and access to finance. As stated earlier, many banks prefer to allocate their resources to <b>large</b> <b>enterprises</b> rather than to SMEs because <b>large</b> <b>enterprises</b> have a lower risk of default and their financial statements are clear. Similarly, Beck et al. (2006) and Beck (2007) found that small firms report significantly higher financing obstacles than medium firms, and both groups of firms report higher financing obstacles than large firms. It is also likely that SMEs are more vulnerable to credit crunches during economic downturns or financial crises than <b>larger</b> <b>enterprises</b> (European Central Bank 2016). Several studies in China (e.g. Shen et al. 2009; Ji 2011; and Yin 2012) concluded that large firms face much fewer obstacles, not only in finance, but also in sales and have greater growth compared with smaller businesses. Moreover, Wang (2016) found that SMEs {{are more likely to}} perceive finance, tax, competition, and electricity as significant constraints that impede their growth than large firm. These results are also aligned with the results of Ali (2016), in their study of 515 food and agribusiness firms in India, where he found that <b>large</b> <b>enterprises</b> perceive more challenges with telecommunication services, customs, trade regulations, and corruption; while small and medium firms face greater constraints in gaining access to land and finance.|$|R
