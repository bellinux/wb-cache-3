The lankford coefficient (r) is a specific material property indicating the ratio between width deformation and thickness deformation in the uniaxial tensile test. Materials with very good deep drawability have an r value of 2 or below.

50|$|In {{order to}} obtain a full forming <b>limit</b> <b>curve,</b> test pieces with {{different}} geometries are drawn by a punch (e. g. with a diameter of 100 mm) until fracture occurs. Friction is almost zero by using a complex tribo-system with foils and grease between sheet and tool. By use of an optical strain measurement system spatial strain paths areevaluated immediately before failure of the test piece. Using an interpolation method for the strain variation between the severely deformed and necked area - the limits of this area are computed by a sign change of the second derivative of the strain distribution - the major and minor strain values are obtained. Using an averaged value for several cross-section evaluations and 3 test samples for the same geometry a strain pair (one point in the forming limit diagram) as forming limit is identified.It is recognized by some authors {{that the nature of}} fracture and formability is intrinsically non-deterministic, since large variations might be observed even within a single experimental campaign.

50|$|Forming limit curves (FLC) {{for four}} steel sheet grades are {{displayed}} in the attached figure. All forming limit curves have essentially the same shape. A minimum of the curve exists at the intercept with the major strain axis or close thereby, the plane strain forming limit. With {{the definition of the}} onset of local necking (e. g. membrane force reaches an extreme value) and the assumption of a hardening law according to Hollomon (σ = K εn) it can be shown that the corresponding theoretical plane strain forming limit is identical with the strain hardening coefficient, n. There is no thickness effect. Taking into account the strain rate sensitivity of the material, which is obvious in steel, along with the sheet thickness, the fact can be explained that practical forming limits, obtained by the use of the above described method, lie well above theoretical forming limits. Thus the basic influence parameters for the forming limits are, the strain hardening exponent, n, the initial sheet thickness, t0 and the strain rate hardening coefficient, m. The lankford coefficient, r, which defines the plastic anisotropy of the material, has two effects on the forming <b>limit</b> <b>curve.</b> On the left side there is no influence except that the curve extends to larger values, on the right hand side increasing r values reduce the forming limits.|$|E

To this end, a model material consisting of a homogeneous zone and a zone that has voids (material inhomogeneity) is proposed and used to simulate necking under plane strain and uni-axial stress load paths. Results of the in-plane loading computations are used to construct a strain-based formability <b>limit</b> <b>curve</b> for the model material.

40|$|Abstract − Just by {{adjusting}} the control points iteratively, progressive iterative approximation (PIA) presents an intuitive and straightforward scheme such that the resulting <b>limit</b> <b>curve</b> (surface) can interpolate the original data points. In order to obtain more flexibility, adjusting only {{a subset of the}} control points, a new method called local progressive iterative approximation (LPIA) has also been proposed. But to this day, there are two problems about PIA and LPIA: (1) Only an approximation process is discussed, but the accurate convergence curves (surfaces) are not given. (2) In order to obtain an interpolating curve (surface) with high accuracy, recursion computations are needed time after time, which result in a large workload. To overcome these limitations, this paper gives an explicit matrix expression of the control points of the <b>limit</b> <b>curve</b> (surface) by the PIA or LPIA method, and proves that the column vector consisting of the control points of the PIA’s <b>limit</b> <b>curve</b> (or surface) can be obtained by multiplying the column vector consisting of the original data points on the left by the inverse matrix of the collocation matrix (or the Kronecker product of the collocation matrices in two direction) of the blending basis at the parametric values chosen by the original data points. Analogously, the control points of the LPIA’s <b>limit</b> <b>curve</b> (or surface) can also be calculated by one-step. Furthermore, the G 1 joining conditions between two adjacent limit curves obtained from two neighboring data points sets are derived.

40|$|Abstract. The {{evaluation}} of forming simulation {{by using the}} forming <b>limit</b> <b>curve</b> has only limited validity if it is applied on car body components with non-linear strain paths. If modern high strength materials are used, the forming limit criteria can also provide invalid predictions. Especially high strength multiphase steels show a specific behaviour in forming, necking and crack initiation. If bending loads are applied to these materials, the onset of cracking occurs partially not {{within the range of}} the forming <b>limit</b> <b>curve</b> (FLC). The stress limit indicates the failure beginning more accurate. It is independent of the forming history and should be less sensitive to the behaviour of high strength steels. In the post processing of a simulation it could be used similar to the forming limit. A <b>limit</b> <b>curve</b> applied on the in-plane-stress-diagram of an analysed component defines areas that are more vulnerable for cracking. The required stress <b>limit</b> <b>curve</b> will be obtained in this research by applying a stretch-bending-test. It is selected in order to reach loads, which are comparable to the forming process in the components ’ production. The forming state that is affecting the specimen is a combination of bending and stretching load. Different load conditions can be applied at the test by altering the stamp-radius and the specimen geometry. Since stresses cannot be measured directly in the experiment, the test is modelled in the simulation where the stresses can be calculated for a given material model. Finally the stress limit criterion was applied on the test parts ’ stress distribution diagram. Occurring stresses above the stress <b>limit</b> <b>curve</b> are displayed on the simulation. Thereby it is possible to show a good correlation in critical areas between the failure prediction in the simulation and occurring rupture on the test component...|$|E
