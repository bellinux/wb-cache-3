During this term he vetoed {{a bill that would}} have disbanded the state police, which were charged with the law's enforcement, and also vetoed a bill replacing prohibition with a <b>licensing</b> <b>scheme.</b> In the 1874 election, anti-prohibition Republicans joined with Democrats to elect William Gaston over Talbot by a narrow margin. The election marked a watershed in post-Civil War Massachusetts, since it was the first victory for a Democrat in that period, and exposed the state Republican Party's fractures on domestic affairs like prohibition. Talbot refused to run in 1875.|$|E
5|$|European {{exploration}} of the future site of Wagga Wagga began in 1829 {{with the arrival of}} Captain Charles Sturt during his expedition along the Murrumbidgee River. Settlers arrived shortly thereafter with Charles Tompson establishing the Eunonyhareenyha 'run' on the north bank of the river in 1832, and then in soon after George Best establishing the Wagga Wagga 'run' on the south bank. Other settlers followed, with all of them initially squatting on the land illegally but by 1836 the colonial government regulated the tenure of land and established a <b>licensing</b> <b>scheme.</b> Within a few years settlers numbers increased greatly and before 1850 a local bench of magistrates and a place for holding petty sessions was established. The beginnings of a village formed near the ford used by most traffic passing through the area and included a crude blacksmith's shop, a hotel, and a post office. By 1849 the town was marked out by surveyor Thomas Scott Townsend and formally gazetted as a village.|$|E
5|$|The first {{implementation}} {{of such a}} scheme was Singapore Area <b>Licensing</b> <b>Scheme</b> in 1975, together with a comprehensive package of road pricing measures, stringent car ownership rules and improvements in mass transit. Thanks to technological advances in electronic toll collection, electronic detection, and video surveillance technology, collecting congestion fees has become easier. Singapore upgraded its system in 1998, and similar pricing schemes were implemented in Rome in 2001, London in 2003 with extensions in 2007; Stockholm in 2006, as a seven-month trial, and then on a permanent basis. In January 2008 Milan began a one-year trial program called Ecopass, charging low emission standard vehicles and exempting cleaner and alternative fuel vehicles. The Ecopass program was extended until December 31, 2011, and on January 16, 2012 was replaced by Area C, a trial program that converted the scheme from a pollution-charge to a congestion charge. The Gothenburg congestion tax was implemented in January 2013 and it was modeled after the Stockholm scheme.|$|E

Sections two and three of the chapter provide a more detailed legal description of these alternative <b>licensing</b> <b>schemes</b> from the perspective of Dutch contract law and Dutch copyright law, respectively. Those aspects that have still not been construed by either common practice or Dutch courts are dealt with from a legislative and doctrinal point of view.

25|$|The Waite Court heard twenty-five {{criminal}} writs {{of error}} {{from the state}} courts (as authorized by § 25 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 and its progeny). Several of these cases involved the compatibility of state criminal laws with the Dormant Commerce Clause (and its counterweight, the police power). In Welton v. Missouri (1875), the Court reversed a conviction for selling goods without a license. In Turner v. Maryland (1883), the Court upheld a statute that required inspection of exported tobacco packed at a different place from where it is grown. Barbier v. Connolly (1884) upheld a ban on laundries. Presser v. Illinois (1886) upheld a ban on militias. Walling v. Michigan (1886) invalidated a tax on out-of-state liquor wholesalers (which {{did not apply to}} in-state liquor wholesalers). Smith v.

25|$|Medallions {{were first}} issued in 1937 {{when the city}} created a <b>licensing</b> <b>scheme,</b> setting the number of cabs at 11,787. This number {{remained}} fixed until 1996. Because the medallion system artificially restricts the number of cabs, it has been criticized as an entry barrier to the New York City taxi market which has in turn created a black market for illegal taxicab operation in areas underserved by medallion cabs. Because the cost of leasing a medallion is so high, the system may cut into the income of drivers and raise costs to passengers. On the other hand, some transportation analysts contend that cities with no barriers to entry to the taxi market end up {{with an abundance of}} poorly maintained taxis. They say that a medallion system helps the city to better regulate taxis and enables the city to raise the standards of all taxis.|$|E

25|$|In Singapore, a broad {{approach}} has been taken towards the determination of whether a decision-maker has exercised its power for an improper purpose. In Public Prosecutor v. Pillay M.M. (1977), the respondent was charged for having driven his car into a restricted zone established under the Singapore Area <b>Licensing</b> <b>Scheme</b> without having paid the requisite fee for doing so, contrary to the Motor Vehicles (Restricted Zone and Area Licences) Rules 1975 which had been issued by the Minister for Communications pursuant to the Road Traffic Act. The respondent argued that the Rules were invalid as the Act only empowered the Minister to make rules to regulate road traffic, and not to collect fees. The High Court held that the Minister had not exceeded the statutory power given {{to him as the}} main purpose of the rules he had imposed was consistent with the objective of the Act, that is, to regulate traffic on the roads. Collecting fees from drivers entering the restricted zone was merely incidental to this purpose. Hence, in Singapore it appears that a decision-maker does not act unlawfully if it exercises a statutory power for a purpose that is incidental to the legislative purpose.|$|E

500|$|After Adolf Hitler's rise {{to power}} in Germany in 1933, local ethnic German party {{established}} its own private security force.

The party's security force {{was transformed into a}} paramilitary organization called [...] "Sudetendeutsches Freikorps" [...] which started conducting terror operations agaist Czechoslovak state, Jews and ethnic Czechs. Especially snipers using scoped hunting rifles became particular concern. This led to adoption of Act No. 81/1938, on Firearms and Ammunition, which for the first time introduced licensing system not only for carrying of firearms, but also for firearms possession. Ministry of Interior was supposed to enact a regulation which would set rules for obtaining the licenses, however, this has not happened. Freikorps was receiving illegal shipments of firearms from Germany, making the envisioned <b>licensing</b> <b>scheme</b> useless. Thus, despite the new law, the enactment of 1852 still remained in force.|$|E
40|$|Effectively {{regulating}} {{the conduct of}} private investigators is a difficult task. The broad scope of their activities exposes them {{to a number of}} areas of common law and various statutes. Unfortunately, the State and Territory legislation relating to the licensing of investigation and commercial agents does not come close to a comprehensive code of conduct and there is little consistency across the different jurisdictions. The <b>licensing</b> <b>schemes</b> have contributed little to the effective regulation of private investigators, largely {{due to the lack of}} effective mechanisms to enforce accountability. The piecemeal regulation also leaves private investigators uncertain as to their rights and obligations under the law and members of the public unsure as to what to do when they are aggrieved by a private investigator's conduct.

[...] Easing of either the law's strict rules or their enforcement was regularly debated in the legislature. [...] Bullock, {{in contrast to the}} laissez-faire approach of Andrew before him, enforced the prohibition law more strictly than any other governor of the period. [...] This policy was probably responsible for the declining margins of victory in his three elections. [...] In 1868, legislative proponents of relaxed rules secured passage of a law abolishing the state police, who were tasked with the law's enforcement. [...] Bullock vetoed this bill, pointing out that the state police performed other vital functions.

500|$|In some instances, {{a statute}} does not clearly define {{what kinds of}} powers are conferred upon the {{relevant}} ministers and statutory bodies.

The Sixth Circuit in Craigmiles v. Giles and the Tenth Circuit case Powers v. Harris, are cases that revolve around similar facts but reach opposite outcomes.
