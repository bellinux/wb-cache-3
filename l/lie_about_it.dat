25|$|Socrates gets Hippias {{to agree}} that the more a man knows about a subject, the better {{position}} he will be in to <b>lie</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> He argues that the man who knows the subjects about which he tells lies, whether arithmetic, geometry, or astronomy, is twice as powerful as the man who does not know his subjects. Socrates never indicates what a man might stand to gain from lying about such matters, but brings the conversation back around to Achilles, and what kind of man Homer intended to portray.|$|E
25|$|Lisa Lepore, Fiore's mother, {{claims that}} the two fought {{frequently}} and that Jenkins had been jealous of Fiore's friendships with her ex-boyfriends. Dan Jenkins, Ryan Jenkins' father, said that Fiore was his son's only friend in California {{and that she would}} disappear {{for days at a time}} and <b>lie</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> to his son. In addition, Lepore told The Associated Press that her daughter had the marriage to Jenkins annulled in May 2009. However, there were no court records of an annulment in either Nevada, where the couple was married, or in Los Angeles County, where they'd most recently lived.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Henry's son Hal is joking, drinking, and thieving with Falstaff and his associates. He likes Falstaff {{but makes}} no pretense at being like him. He enjoys {{insulting}} his dissolute friend and makes sport of him by joining in Poins’ plot to disguise themselves and rob and terrify Falstaff and three friends of loot they have stolen in a highway robbery, purely {{for the fun of}} watching Falstaff <b>lie</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> later, after which Hal returns the stolen money. Rather early in the play, in fact, Hal informs us that his riotous time will soon come to a close, and he will re-assume his rightful high place in affairs by showing himself worthy to his father and others through some (unspecified) noble exploits. Hal believes that this sudden change of manner will amount to a greater reward and acknowledgment of prince-ship, and in turn earn him respect from the members of the court.|$|E

500|$|In October 1939 The Rules of the Game {{was officially}} banned in France for being [...] "depressing, morbid, immoral [...] having an {{undesirable}} {{influence over the}} young." [...] Other films that were similarly banned included Marcel Carné's Le Quai des brumes and Le Jour Se Lève. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated [...] "we are especially anxious to avoid representations of our country, our traditions, and our race that changes its character, <b>lie</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and deform it {{through the prism of}} an artistic individual who is often original but not always sound." [...] The Marriage of Figaro, one of the inspirations for the film, had also been banned for similar reasons. After the end of World War II the 85-minute version of the film was re-released in Paris on September 26, 1945, and it was again banned.|$|E

Ablett's faith was often highlighted in several tribunal appearances, in one case confessing and pleading guilty to striking Garry Lyon in a 1989 incident, declaring he [...] "wasn't prepared to <b>lie</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> or compromise the truth in [...] relationship with God". Ablett's public acknowledgement of his faith, in particular the influence of God in his life, during his acceptance speech for the Norm Smith Medal in the 1989 Grand Final, was also much publicised.|$|E

Leslie Powell and Will Cuddy (the Green team) won the first Magic Box in the episode [...] "Mana Kisi". Inside, the Magic Box contained one free round at the Temple of Fate, to be used before the Temple of Fate challenge begins. In addition to winning a Magic Box, teams are allowed {{to do what they want}} with the information given.

2500|$|Despite Carey's {{pledge to}} {{eliminate}} corruption {{and the influence}} of organized crime in the Teamsters, there were many who claimed that he did little in his first term to tackle the problem. Federal investigators accused Carey of engaging in [...] "halfhearted" [...] reforms, permitting a Teamster with known organized crime links to oversee a corrupt local, hindering court-appointed trustees reforming locals, and setting up an ethical practices committee which did nothing to stop corruption. One organized crime figure, Alphonse [...] "Little Al" [...] D'Arco, former acting boss of the Lucchese crime family, even said he had had a relationship with Carey in the 1960s and 1970s—statements Carey vigorously denied. U.S. Department of Justice officials began an investigation into the accusations in June 1994. There were also claims that Carey had improperly intervened in a jurisdictional dispute between two Teamster locals. Carey was also accused of a conflict of interest for not disclosing that he had received UPS stock from his deceased father's estate. [...] Joseph Carey bought eight shares of stock in 1935 for $320, which over the years (including stock splits) grew to 112,000 shares worth $1.9 million. The stock was sold back to the company by the estate in August 1992, and Carey was cleared of the charges. In May 1994, Carey was accused of corruption regarding a number of real estate deals. The Independent Review Board (IRB), a three-member panel created under a Federal court order in 1989 designed to help supervise the union's elections and rid it of corruption, began an investigation into how Carey was able to finance {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} in real estate investments and into who may have forged Carey's estranged wife's signature on several documents. Carey later admitted he had forged his wife's signature but claimed he did so with her permission. Carey said he financed all the investments though savings, loans from relatives, and his $1.9 million inheritance. Carey was cleared by the IRB of all charges in July 1994. The IRB said no fraudulent activity had occurred in the financing of the deals. Although Carey did forge his wife's signature and asked a union employee to <b>lie</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> the IRB concluded that Carey's wife had given him permission to sign her name and that the forgeries were unrelated to union activities.|$|E
