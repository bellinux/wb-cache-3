5|$|NY38 {{continues}} {{north as}} an unnamed highway to the hamlet of Conquest, {{a small community}} built up around the intersection of NY38 and Fuller and Slayton Roads. It continues on into the town of Victory, where the undeveloped fields give way to cultivated fields used as farmland. The route heads through mostly desolate surroundings to the hamlet of Victory, a slightly <b>larger</b> <b>community</b> centered on NY38. The route proceeds through the hamlet, passing by several homes {{on its way to}} a junction with NY370 just north of the community. Past this point, the homes cease again as NY38 presses on through more fields and forests to the town of Sterling.|$|E
5|$|This {{multi-storied}} ruin, {{the best-known}} cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde, {{is located in}} the largest alcove {{in the center of the}} Great Mesa. It was south- and southwest-facing, providing greater warmth from the sun in the winter. Dating back more than 700 years, the dwelling is constructed of sandstone, wooden beams, and mortar. Many of the rooms were brightly painted. Cliff Palace was home to approximately 125 people, but was likely an important part of a <b>larger</b> <b>community</b> of sixty nearby pueblos, which housed a combined six hundred or more people. With 23 kivas and 150 rooms, Cliff Palace is the largest cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde National Park.|$|E
5|$|Allen and {{his family}} moved to Burlington in 1787, which was no longer a small {{frontier}} settlement but a small town, and much more to Allen's liking than the <b>larger</b> <b>community</b> that Bennington had become. He frequented the tavern there, and began work on An Essay on the Universal Plenitude of Being, which he characterized as an appendix to Reason. This essay was less polemic than many of his earlier writings. He affirmed the perfection of God and His creation, and credited intuition as well as reason as a way to bring Man closer to the universe. The work was not published until long after his death, and is primarily of interest to students of Transcendentalism, a movement the work foreshadows.|$|E

25|$|Believing {{that the}} school needed {{the support of a}} <b>larger</b> <b>community,</b> the {{university}} moved in 1902 to Waxahachie, Texas. In 1906, the university, along with many Cumberland Presbyterian churches, affiliated with the United Presbyterian Church. The Stock Market Crash of 1929, however, severely hindered the university's growth. Enrollment declined sharply, indebtedness and faculty attrition mounted, and trustees began using endowment funds to maintain daily operations. Consequently, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools placed Trinity's accreditation status on probation in 1936, jeopardizing its future. Once again, its leaders began to consider relocation to a <b>larger</b> <b>community</b> to improve the university's viability.|$|E
25|$|Edward Winslow's {{list was}} similar. In {{addition}} to the economic worries and missionary possibilities, he stressed {{that it was important}} for the people to retain their English identity, culture, and language. They also believed that the English Church in Leiden could do little to benefit the <b>larger</b> <b>community</b> there.|$|E

30|$|Figure  20 c {{shows the}} number of authors over the years for the {{following}} groups of communities: all communities, 20, 10 and 5 <b>largest</b> <b>communities,</b> and the <b>largest</b> <b>community.</b> We observe that from 2004 to 2012 {{the number of}} authors per community increases considerably. As stated before, such increase {{is due to the}} growth of a few <b>communities</b> with a <b>large</b> number of authors. In this way, we observe that in 2004, the 5 <b>largest</b> <b>communities</b> represent approximately 64  % of the top 10 communities and approximately 48  % of the top 20 <b>largest</b> <b>communities.</b> Considering the year 2012, these values are 79 and 65  %, respectively. We also observe that the top 5 communities represent a significant amount (29  %) of all considered authors. This result indicates that authors in the <b>largest</b> <b>communities</b> interact with researchers outside their communities, thus increasing it over time.|$|R

25|$|In 1966, {{students}} {{established an}} Upward Bound program, {{funded by the}} Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, to help prepare students from lower-income and poverty areas for college. The Arts Castle, the Early Childhood Center, the Big Pal/Little Pal Program, the Andrews House, the Office of Community Service, and the International Ambassador High School Program are among the many programs founded since the 1970s to provide services to the <b>larger</b> <b>community</b> in Delaware.|$|E
25|$|As family {{responsibilities}} and vocational pressures lessen, friendships become more important. Among the elderly, friendships can provide {{links to the}} <b>larger</b> <b>community,</b> serve as a protective factor against depression and loneliness, and compensate for potential losses in social support previously given by family members. Especially for people who cannot go out as often, interactions with friends allow for continued societal interaction. Additionally, older adults in declining health who remain in contact with friends show improved psychological well-being.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability of}} women to utilize health care is also heavily {{influenced}} by other forms of structural gender inequalities. These include unequal restriction on one’s mobility and behavior, as well as unequal control over financial resources. Many of these social gender inequalities can impact the way women’s health is regarded, which can in turn determine the level of access women have to healthcare services and {{the extent by which}} households and the <b>larger</b> <b>community</b> are willing to invest in women’s health issues.|$|E

25|$|Increase in ghetto living {{has also}} shown a {{strengthening}} of stereotyping {{due to lack of}} cross-cultural interaction, and reduction in economic and educational opportunities at large. On the other hand, the <b>larger</b> <b>community</b> which for centuries had benefited from its interactions with Islamic traditions, to create a rich cultural and social fabric, formed through amalgamation of the two diverse traditions faces a danger of fast becoming insular. Secularism in India is being seen by some as a favour to the Muslims, and not an imperative for democracy.|$|E
25|$|As {{with any}} spoken language, sign {{languages}} are also vulnerable to becoming endangered. For example, a sign language {{used by a}} small community may be endangered and even abandoned as users shift to a sign language used by a <b>larger</b> <b>community,</b> as has happened with Hawai'i Sign Language, which is almost extinct {{except for a few}} elderly signers. Even national sign languages can be endangered; for example, New Zealand Sign Language is losing users. Methods are being developed to assess the language vitality of sign languages.|$|E
25|$|The William H. Roberts House {{was built}} in 1883 for Dr. William H. Roberts of Pecatonica for a cost of US$3,240. At the time, it was {{considered}} one of the finest homes in Pecatonica. The house is located on Main Street, on the edge of Pecatonica's downtown. The location made Roberts accessible to the townspeople and connected his work life as a physician and surgeon with the <b>larger</b> <b>community</b> in Pecatonica. Roberts died at age 33 on June 23, 1886, following an illness; when he died he had many friends and was respected within the village of Pecatonica.|$|E

25|$|SBML Level 2 was {{conceived}} at the 5th Workshop on Software Platforms for Systems Biology, held in July 2002, at the University of Hertfordshire, UK. By this time, far {{more people were}} involved than the original group of SBML collaborators and the continued evolution of SBML became a <b>larger</b> <b>community</b> effort, with many new tools having been enhanced to support SBML. The workshop participants in 2002 collectively decided to revise the form of SBML in Level2. The first draft of the Level2 Version1 specification was released in August 2002, and the final set of features was finalized in May 2003 at the 7th Workshop on Software Platforms for Systems Biology in Ft.Lauderdale, Florida.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though this}} solar {{technology}} {{may have a}} higher starting cost than that of conventional fossil fuel, the low maintenance and operation cost {{and the ability to}} operate without fuel makes the solar powered systems cheaper to keep running. A small rural community could use a system like this indefinitely, and it would provide clean drinking water at a negligible cost after the initial equipment purchase and setup. In a <b>larger</b> <b>community,</b> it could at least contribute to the water supply and reduce pressures of daily survival. This technology is capable of pumping hundreds of gallons of water per day, and is limited only by the amount of water available in the water table.|$|E

25|$|However, as Islam {{progresses}} with Science, {{there are}} rigorous scholarly debates among the Islamic School of Law (Fiqh) {{as to whether}} LGBT are define by genetic disorders and {{that it may be}} permissible or not for those who're scientifically-medically-proven {{to be part of the}} LGBT category as with hermaphrodite denoting whether a person is incline towards the naturality of female or male instinct.

25|$|Not {{far from}} the town line, all {{development}} along the road ceases as it enters the Cicero Swamp Wildlife Management Area, which covers part of a large, low-lying swamp known as Cicero Swamp. It heads across wooded swampland for about , becoming Minoa Road in the process. Homes begin to line the highway again {{just north of the}} marsh, where NY298 makes a slight turn to the north as it begins to parallel Chittenango Creek, here forming the boundary between Onondaga County and Madison County. The waterway leads the highway into the commercialized hamlet of Oneida Park, where NY298 ends at an intersection with NY31. On the opposite bank of the creek is the slightly <b>larger</b> <b>community</b> of Bridgeport, located just east of Oneida Park on NY31.|$|E
25|$|The United Nations has {{identified}} {{the enhancement of}} women's involvement as way to achieve gender equality {{in the realm of}} education, work, and health. This is because women play critical roles as caregivers, formally and informally, in both the household and the <b>larger</b> <b>community.</b> Within the United States, an estimated 66% of all caregivers are female, with one-third of all female caregivers taking care of two or more people According to the World Health Organization, it is important that approaches and frameworks that are being implemented to address gender disparities in health acknowledge the fact that majority of the care work is provided by women. A meta-analysis of 40 different women's empowerment projects found that increased female participation have led to a broad range of quality of life improvements. These improvements include increases in women's advocacy demands and organization strengths, women-centered policy and governmental changes, and improved economic conditions for lower class women.|$|E
