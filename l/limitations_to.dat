30|$|To {{clarify the}} spatiotemporal {{patterns}} {{on the basis of}} the above mapping, the hazards are characterized following the concepts developed by Egli (1996) and Bloetzer (1998), who define five natural hazard characteristics: <b>limitation</b> <b>to</b> specific locations; <b>limitation</b> <b>to</b> time; spontaneity; <b>limitation</b> <b>to</b> space; possibility to intervene.|$|R
30|$|The second characteristic, <b>limitation</b> <b>to</b> time, {{refers to}} {{specific}} temporal conditions that accompany {{the occurrence of}} hazards, such as seasons (Egli 1996).

Future changes of the precipitation regime due to climate change may increase the <b>limitation</b> <b>to</b> time.|$|R

5|$|Family members {{contribute}} to pragmatic development in different ways. Fathers often act as secondary caregivers, and may know the child less intimately. Older siblings may lack {{the capacity to}} acknowledge the child's needs. As a result, both fathers and siblings may pressure children to communicate more clearly. They often challenge children to improve their communication skills, therefore preparing them to communicate with strangers about unfamiliar topics. Fathers have more breakdowns when communicating with infants, and spend less time focused on the same objects or actions as infants. Siblings are more directive and less responsive to infants, which motivates infants to participate in conversations with their older siblings. There are <b>limitations</b> <b>to</b> studies {{that focus on the}} influences of fathers and siblings, as most research is descriptive and correlational. In reality, there are many variations of family configurations, and context influences parent behaviour more than parent gender does. The majority of research in this field is conducted with mother/child pairs.|$|E

The Court rejected {{the application of the}} basic features doctrine owing to the differences in the making of the Singapore Constitution and the Indian Constitution, {{and the fact that the}} framers of the Singapore Constitution had not expressly provided for <b>limitations</b> <b>to</b> be placed on Parliament's power of amendment. The Court also held that, in any case, there had been no violation of the Constitution's basic features on the facts of the case. On appeal, the Court of Appeal determined the case on other grounds, and thus found it unnecessary to decide conclusively if the basic features doctrine applies in Singapore.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{the fiscal}} {{pressure}} on the kingdom caused by Edward's expensive alliances led to discontent at home. The regency council at home was frustrated by the mounting national debt, while the king and his commanders on the Continent were angered {{by the failure of}} the government in England to provide sufficient funds. To deal with the situation, Edward himself returned to England, arriving in London unannounced on 30 November 1340. Finding the affairs of the realm in disorder, he purged the royal administration of a great number of ministers and judges. These measures did not bring domestic stability, and a stand-off ensued between the king and John de Stratford, Archbishop of Canterbury, during which Stratford's relatives Robert Stratford Bishop of Chichester and Henry de Stratford were temporarily stripped of title and imprisoned respectively. Stratford claimed that Edward had violated the laws of the land by arresting royal officers. A certain level of conciliation was reached at the parliament of April 1341. Here Edward was forced to accept severe <b>limitations</b> <b>to</b> his financial and administrative freedom, in return for a grant of taxation. Yet in October the same year, the king repudiated this statute and Archbishop Stratford was politically ostracised. The extraordinary circumstances of the April parliament had forced the king into submission, but under normal circumstances the powers of the king in medieval England were virtually unlimited, a fact that Edward was able to exploit.|$|E
5|$|Norway has {{a unified}} police, {{which means that}} there is a single police {{organization}} and that police power and prosecutor power is not granted to other agencies within Norway. The sole exception is the military police, albeit which only has jurisdiction over military personnel and on military installations, except during martial law. The police are decentralized and generalized to allow a more flexible resource allocation, while remaining under political control. This entails that police officers have no geographical or sector <b>limitations</b> <b>to</b> their powers. The Police Act and several special laws regulate the agencies and the officer's powers and responsibilities. The police are required to assist other public institutions, including the healthcare authorities, and can be asked by other agencies to assist when it is necessary to enact a decision by force. Conversely, the police can ask for assistance from the Coast Guard when necessary. The police are responsible for all responses against terrorism and sabotage unless Norway is under armed attack.|$|E
5|$|There are <b>limitations</b> <b>to</b> {{the use of}} {{bivalves}} as bioindicators. The {{level of}} pollutants found in the tissues varies with species, age, size, time of year and other factors. The quantities of pollutants in the water may vary and the molluscs may reflect past rather than present values. In a study of several bivalve species present in lagoons in Ghana {{it was found that}} the findings could be anomalous. Levels of zinc and iron tended to rise in the wet season due to run-off from the galvanized roofing sheets used in many of the houses. Cadmium levels were lower in young animals than in older ones because they were growing so fast that, despite the fact that their bodies were accumulating the metal, the concentration in their tissues reduced. In a study near Vladivostok {{it was found that the}} level of pollutants in the bivalve tissues did not always reflect the high levels in the surrounding sediment in such places as harbours. The reason for this was thought to be that the bivalves in these locations did not need to filter so much water as elsewhere because of the water's high nutritional content.|$|E
