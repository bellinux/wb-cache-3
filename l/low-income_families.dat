This study {{examined}} {{whether there was}} any difference {{in the relationship between}} cognitive strategies and academic achievement depending on middle school students’ family income status. Independent samples t-tests were conducted to examine whether there was any difference in the use of cognitive strategies and academic achievement between the adolescents of <b>low-income</b> <b>family</b> and normal income family. Also, {{to find out if the}} family income status x cognitive strategy interaction affected the adolescents&# 39; academic achievement, hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted. The main findings of the study are as follow. First, the adolescents from <b>low-income</b> <b>family</b> show lower average scores in the academic achievement and in the utilization of &# 39;elaboration strategy&# 39;, one of the cognitive strategies that requires deep information processing, compared to the adolescents from normal-income family. Second, the result of analysis of the family income level x elaboration interaction shows that there is a difference in the effect of cognitive strategy on the academic achievement depending on the adolescents‘ family income level. This study has an important implication as it explored the cognitive aspect of the adolescents of the <b>low-income</b> <b>family</b> by applying the information processing level theory...|$|R
5|$|The minimum {{statutory}} entitlement for {{paid holidays}} was increased from 4.8 to 5.6 weeks per annum, and Child Benefit was disregarded in calculating income for Housing and Council Tax Benefit {{as a means}} of improving work incentives and the incomes of many <b>low-income</b> <b>families.</b> Parents with children up to the age of 16 were given the statutory right to request flexible working arrangements.|$|E

5|$|Houses at Noel Park were {{deliberately}} {{designed to}} be relatively small, both for cheapness and to discourage tenants from taking on lodgers. Many of the larger houses at Shaftesbury Park had been sublet and split, and the practice went against {{the principles of the}} Artizans Company's founders. To discourage the practice at Queen's Park and Noel Park, cottage flats were built; these maintained the terraced façade, but split the house into upper and lower flats, each flat having a separate front door onto the street. Many properties, particularly on the central Gladstone Avenue, were built in this style; this maintained the unbroken façade of the first-class houses, but allowed large numbers of smaller and <b>low-income</b> <b>families</b> to be housed.|$|E

5|$|In the inter-war period, Sleaford's {{population}} remained static, but the Great Depression in the 1930s caused unemployment to rise.

In the post-war period, there were new housing developments at St Giles Avenue, the Hoplands, Russell Crescent, Jubilee Grove and Grantham Road. Parts of the town were redeveloped: in 1958, the Bristol Arms Arcade opened, the Corn Exchange was demolished in the 1960s and the Waterside Shopping Precinct opened in 1973, as did Flaxwell House, designed to house a department store, though later becoming the national headquarters for Interflora.|$|E
5|$|Overall, almost 36,000residences {{were damaged}} {{as a result}} of Catarina's onslaught; of those, 993 {{collapsed}} completely. The commercial sector fared slightly better, as only 2,274buildings were damaged and 472 collapsed. Finally, 397public buildings were damaged and three were destroyed. These account for 26% of the total buildings in the region, and property damage of $25.6million (2004 USD $ USD). Four-fifths of the damaged houses had some sort of roof failure or collapse. Most of the damage was blamed on the low quality of the construction; brick residences typically lacked plaster, beams, or columns, for example. The areas affected the most were those inhabited by <b>low-income</b> <b>families,</b> usually with annual family salaries of less than $400USD.|$|E
5|$|The General Assembly was {{controlled}} by Democrats, but Nunn was able to pass most of his agenda.

Nunn's budget focused on increased funding for education, mental health, and economic development. In the 1970 legislative session, the General Assembly enacted Nunn's proposals to eliminate taxes on prescription drugs and the use fee charged on vehicles transferred within families, but rejected his plans to reduce the income tax for <b>low-income</b> <b>families</b> and increase tax credits for the blind and the elderly.|$|E

5|$|Although she {{had long}} broken her formal ties with the British Communist Party, Wilkinson {{retained}} strong links with other communist organisations at home and abroad. Her association with leading communists such as Willi Münzenberg and Otto Katz is revealed in British intelligence files held on her. However, she {{was not prepared to}} risk losing her parliamentary seat, and thus kept her rebellious behaviour within bounds. In 1937 Wilkinson was {{one of a group of}} Labour figures—Aneurin Bevan, Harold Laski and Stafford Cripps were others—who founded the left-wing magazine Tribune; in the first issue she wrote of the need to fight unemployment, poverty, malnutrition and inadequate housing. Mindful of the dependence of many <b>low-income</b> <b>families</b> on credit, she introduced a bill to regulate hire purchase agreements, at the time a subject of frequent abuse, and with all-party support she secured the passage of the Hire Purchase Act 1938.|$|E
5|$|In 1936 the U.S. {{court ruled}} in U.S. v. One Package that {{medically}} prescribing contraception {{to save a}} persons life or well being was not illegal under the Comstock Law; following this decision, the American Medical Association Committee on Contraception revoked its 1936 statement condemning birth control. A national survey in 1937 showed 71 percent {{of the adult population}} supported the use of contraception. By 1938 347 birth control clinics were running in the United States despite their advertisement still being illegal. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt publicly supported birth control and family planning. In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson started endorsing public funding for family planning services, and the Federal Government began subsidizing birth control services for <b>low-income</b> <b>families.</b> The Affordable Care Act, passed into law on March 23, 2010 under President Barack Obama, requires all plans in the Health Insurance Marketplace to cover contraceptive methods. These include barrier methods, hormonal methods, implanted devices, emergency contraceptives, and sterilization procedures.|$|E

Four out of five children had watched it over a six-week period, and 90% of children from low-income inner-city homes regularly viewed the show. According to a 1993 survey conducted by the US Department of Education, out of the show's 6.6 million viewers, 2.4 million kindergartners regularly watched it. 77% of preschoolers watched it once a week, and 86% of kindergartners, first-, and second-grade students had watched it once a week before starting school. The show reached most young children in almost all demographic groups, most significantly economically disadvantaged children; 88% of children from <b>low-income</b> <b>families</b> and 90% of both African-American and Latino children watched the show before entering kindergarten. Over 80% of children from all minority language groups watched it before starting school. Children from the poorest communities were most likely to be regular viewers, as were younger children. Children whose parents did not read to them regularly were less likely to be regular viewers, and children of highly educated parents stopped viewing earlier than children from disadvantaged households.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} heterogeneous {{effects of}} uncertainty of the U. S. tax policies across income classes. We construct a multi-class general equilibrium stochastic OLG model with a stochastic process of effective tax rates. In accordance with empirical evidence, the model includes two types of families: a high-income family, whose members have bequest motives and share risks; and a <b>low-income</b> <b>family,</b> whose members do not. Some notable results are as follows: (i) under a CRRA preference the efficient allocation of resources within family generates the same proportional standard deviation of consumption and leisure among family members; (ii) the welfare cost of the uncertainty of a tax policy is higher for the <b>low-income</b> <b>family</b> than for the high-income family: the cost for the low-lifetime-income family is about 145 % of that for the high-lifetime-income family; Finally, (iii) the absolute level of the welfare cost for the whole population is shown to be about 0. 53 % of GNP, which {{is higher than the}} welfare cost measures by previous research such as Bizer and Judd (1989) and Skinner (1988).
