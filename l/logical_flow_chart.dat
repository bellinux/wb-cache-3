Among them: Total Design concept, Concurrent Engineering concept, Simultaneous Engineering concept, KANSEI Engineering concept and so on. In this paper the authors will examined the engineering design activity related to all aspects that take place for entire duration of Product Life Cycle (PLC). A new diagram is introduced in order to define Product Green Life Cycle (PGLC). The system or product {{that has to be}} designed will be split in two subsystems: one is related to the product functions and its components and the second one is related to the aspects of product manufacturing. There will be examined the transformations which are applied on the inputs in order to obtain the needed outputs. Due to the needed inputs and transformations, will result not only needed outputs, but many other secondary outputs. Part of the secondary outputs will claim other secondary inputs. All have to be pounted out with accuracy. The block diagrams will be the main instrument used in the proposed approach, for both subsystems. The presented methodoloty can be applied to any activity for the entire PGLC. A <b>logical</b> <b>flow</b> <b>chart</b> that can be used at any design stage is presented, also.

The protocol is called Advanced Multiple Access Protocol for Multimedia Transmission (AMAPMT) and {{is to be used}} in the Data Link Layer of the protocol stack. The principle of operation of the protocol is presented in a number of <b>logical</b> <b>flow</b> <b>charts.</b> The protocol grants permission to transmit to a source on the basis of a priority scheme that takes into account a time-to-live (TTL) parameter of all the transactions, selectable priorities assigned to all the sources and relevant channel state information (CSI) in this order. Performance of the protocol is evaluated in terms of quality of service parameters like packet loss ratio (PLR), mean packet transfer delay (MPTD) and throughput. Using a simulation model based on an OPNET simulation software package does the evaluation. Under various traffic loads with constant distributions with various mean arrival rates and transaction sizes results obtained show that the performance is improved when this priority scheme is used than when it is not used. The results for AMAPMT are compared with that of the best currently available multiple access protocol called Adaptive Request Channel Multiple Access (ARCMA).

40|$|There {{are more}} than 200 {{steganography}} tools have been developed by software developers for use in digital media. Multimedia technologies are readily available in the steganography field. They have complex encoding algorithms and compression methods to hide information. Audio is a common multimedia format that is widely used in the Internet. The uploading, downloading and transmission of audio files through the Internet is done through many different audio streams. Audio steganography activities could happen {{in any of those}} audio streams. The possibility puts challenges to traditional digital forensic investigation. In order to investigate audio streaming steganography, several steganography detection tools and network stream capture tools need to be involved and evaluated. The current academic literature has little support in this topic area for forensic investigation knowledge. Therefore, the main focus of the research project is to investigate steganography in audio streams as a forensic investigation. The research asked the question; What are the procedures and challenges when conducting digital forensic investigations for audio steganography? Five testing phases were designed. In phase 1, three audio steganography tools and two steganography detection tools were tested in order to determine suitable tools for conducting case scenario testing. Openpuff and StegAlyzerAS were found to be the best audio steganography embedding tool and detection tool respectively. WireShark was tested to evaluate audio streaming capture capability as well as packets analysis capability. Phase two involved conducting the case scenario simulating a criminal activity using audio steganography in which Openpuff was used to create four audio steganography files containing evidence. Phase 3 and phase 4 then used combinations of digital forensic tools and steganalysis tools to detect and extract the secret contents from audio streams using standard forensic procedures. The research findings showed that Openpuff was better than Mp 3 Stegz and S-Tools both in audio steganography embedding processes and audio steganography extraction processes. StegAlyzerAS was capable of detecting audio steganography tools after scanning while StegAlyzerSS was incapable of detection audio steganography contents during scanning. Additionally, WireShark successfully captured audio streaming packets. The analysis on these captured packets indicated that WireShark would not identify any steganography activities but the analysis could show information such as the type of files in the packet. This information was then used to reduce the scope of the forensic investigation and to better target audio steganography on a suspect’s hard drive. After comparative analysis on original evidence and extracted evidence, the extraction rate of audio steganography achieved 75 % in the case simulation. The research has provided knowledge on audio steganography investigation methods and indicates that current forensic tools could cause problems for investigation unless correctly applied. Current steganalysis tools are designed for looking at particular algorithms in steganography but there are other algorithms that are used in audio steganography. This is the challenge for forensic investigators. Therefore, a possible design of an audio steganography tool within a <b>logical</b> <b>flow</b> <b>chart</b> diagram was proposed for future research (see Figure 6. 1) ...|$|E

40|$|In any {{business}} process reengineering (BPR) project, {{a thorough understanding of}} various tasks and activities of the organization is required. Very often this idea is captured using a simple <b>flow</b> <b>chart</b> or static representation diagram. The weakness here is that the process design complexity is not adequately represented by the use of <b>flow</b> <b>charts,</b> and this allows for limited human-computer interaction during the process design and analysis. In this paper, we propose an enhanced <b>flow</b> <b>chart</b> approach; the concept of activity-section <b>flow</b> <b>chart</b> to support BPR, which is a combination of the existing activity <b>flow</b> <b>chart</b> and section <b>flow</b> <b>chart.</b> Using this approach, a human-computer interactive model for BPR is devoped. This model can identify the unreasonable activity loops and excessive business rounds between sections by the adjacent and reachable matrices. Via the human-computer interaction, the process can be revised by human experience. This approach provides an efficient tool for BPR of large-scale systems. It has been applied to the material supply management system of an iron and steel works, and satisfactory results have been achieved. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R
