50|$|Vehicle {{detection}} loops, called inductive-loop traffic detectors, {{can detect}} vehicles passing or {{arriving at a}} certain point, for instance approaching a traffic light or in motorway traffic. An insulated, electrically conducting loop is installed in the pavement. The electronics unit transmits energy into the wire loops at frequencies between 10 kHz to 200 kHz, depending on the model. The inductive-loop system behaves as a tuned electrical circuit in which the loop wire and <b>lead-in</b> <b>cable</b> are the inductive elements. When a vehicle passes over the loop or is stopped within the loop, the vehicle induces eddy currents in the wire loops, which decrease their inductance. The decreased inductance actuates the electronics unit output relay or solid-state optically isolated output, which sends a pulse to the traffic signal controller signifying the passage or presence of a vehicle. Parking structures for automobiles may use inductive loops to track traffic (occupancy) in and out or may be used by access gates or ticketing systems to detect vehicles while others use Parking guidance and information systems. Railways may use an induction loop to detect the passage of trains past a given point, as an electronic treadle.|$|E
30|$|To obtain {{high-quality}} MCS data, we shot an air gun array at a spacing of 37.5  m, which {{corresponds to}} a spacing of 20 to 30  s depending on the vessel speed (average of 4 kn). The tuned air gun array had a maximum capacity of 7, 800  in. 3 (approximately 130  l) and consisted of 32 air guns. The standard air pressure was 2, 000  psi (approximately 14  MPa). During the experiment, the air gun array depth was maintained at 6  m below the sea surface. During shooting, we towed a 360 -channel hydrophone streamer cable with a group interval of 12.5  m. The lengths of the total active section and <b>lead-in</b> <b>cable</b> were 4, 500 and 110  m, respectively. The towing depth of the streamer cable was maintained at 10  m below the sea surface by depth controllers. The sampling rate and record length were 2  ms and 15  s, respectively.|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to determine the noise characteristics of a hydrophone streamer that had incorporated a number of noise reduction features, In the original system, the channels to which the depth-controller birds were attached were 3 to 4 times noisier than nonbird channels. Fortunately, the bird noise is near-field and is eliminated simply by increasing bird/hydrophone separation to 9 ft. On this cable, no other discrete noise sources are evident. The boat, propulsion system, <b>lead-in</b> <b>cable,</b> tail buoy, and ambient sea conditions (moderate seas) do not generate sig-nificant noise at towing speeds above 5 knots. The noise on individual hydrophones not near birds is mainly random with only a small coherent component traveling horizontally through {{the water from the}} direction of the boat. However, since the 145 ft hydrophone arrays of 20 detectors are much more effective in reducing random noise than coherent noise, the array output consists of approximately equal portions of each. A twofold decrease in the total noise-to-signal ratio would result from doubling the array length (to 290 ft) while maintaining the same hydrophone density. This would result in a four to fivefold decrease in thecoherent noise-to-signal ratio and a 30 percent decrease in the random noise-to-signal ratio. Addi-tional noise reduction would result from in-creasing the hydrophone density- and decreasing the motion sensitivity of the hydrophones. (The streamer hydrophones are not the motion canccl-ing type.) At a towing speed of 5. 3 knots, the noise level recorded on an array (not near a bird) is equiva-lent to pressures of 1 pbar. In normal operations with an g-gun sleeve exploder source, a stacked section signal-to-towing noise ratio of 3 was ob-tained at 3. 0 sec. However, the towing noise increases as the cube of the boat speed, and the S/N ratio would decrease by a factor of 11 if the boat speed were doubled. Conversely, decreasing the boat speed by 18 percent would double the signal-to-towing noise ratio...|$|E
