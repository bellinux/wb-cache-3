2500|$|Often a {{commercial}} insured's liability insurance program consists of several layers. [...] The first layer of insurance generally consists of primary insurance, which provides first dollar indemnity for judgments and settlements {{up to the}} <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> liability of the primary policy. [...] Generally, primary insurance is subject to a deductible and obligates the insured to defend the insured against lawsuits, which is normally accomplished by assigning counsel to defend the insured. [...] In many instances, {{a commercial}} insured may elect to self-insure. [...] Above the primary insurance or self-insured retention, the insured may have one or more layers of excess insurance to provide coverage additional <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> protection. There {{are a variety of}} types of excess insurance, including [...] "stand-alone" [...] excess policies (policies that contain their own terms, conditions, and exclusions), [...] "follow form" [...] excess insurance (policies that follow the terms of the underlying policy except as specifically provided), and [...] "umbrella" [...] insurance policies (excess insurance that in some circumstances could provide coverage that is broader than the underlying insurance).|$|R

40|$|The {{principle}} <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> is well-accepted in {{the field}} of insurance and is also commonly assumed in the literature of optimal contract design. However, should this principle be imposed on all insurance contracts without exceptions? Does there exist an insurance contract that is optimal for both the insurer and the insured even as the principle <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> is violated? The answer is yes. This paper demonstrates that in the insurance market there do exist contracts in which optimality is accompanied by a violation <b>of</b> the <b>indemnity</b> principle if the insurer and insured have deviant beliefs in loss distribution. We further use retrospective rating as an example to explain why an insurance contract, violating the principle <b>of</b> <b>indemnity,</b> commonly exists in commercial insurance, especially where moral hazard and adverse selection is less severe...|$|R

5000|$|The Divine Principle goes on {{to explain}} three types <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> {{conditions}}. Equal conditions <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> pay back the full value of what was lost. The biblical verse [...] "life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth" [...] (Exod.21:23-24) is quoted as an example <b>of</b> an equal <b>indemnity</b> condition. Lesser conditions <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> provide a benefit greater than the price that is paid. Faith, baptism, and the eucharist are mentioned as examples <b>of</b> lesser <b>indemnity</b> conditions. Greater conditions <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> come about when a person fails in a lesser condition. In that case a greater price must be paid {{to make up for}} the earlier failure. Abraham's attempted sacrifice of his son Isaac (Gen. 22:1-18) and the Israelites' 40 years of wandering in the wilderness under Moses (Num.14:34) are mentioned as examples <b>of</b> greater <b>indemnity</b> conditions. The Divine Principle then explains that an indemnity condition must reverse the course by which the mistake or loss came about. Indemnity, at its core, is required of humans because God is pure, and purity cannot relate directly with impurity. Indemnification is the vehicle that allows a [...] "just and righteous" [...] God to work through mankind. Jesus' statement that God had forsaken him (Matt.27:46) and Christianity's history of martyrdom are mentioned as examples of this. The Divine Principle then states that human beings, not God or the angels, are the ones responsible for making indemnity conditions.|$|R
