40|$|Patients with parieto-occipital {{brain damage}} may show simultanagnosia, a {{selective}} impairment in the simultaneous perception {{and integration of}} multiple objects (global perception) with normal recognition of individual objects. Recent findings in patients with simultanagnosia indicate improved global perception at smaller spatial distances between <b>local</b> <b>elements</b> of hierarchical organized complex visual arrays. Global perception thus {{does not appear to}} be an all-or-nothing phenomenon but can be modified by the spatial relationship between <b>local</b> <b>elements.</b> The present study aimed to define characteristics of a general principle that accounts for improved global perception of hierarchically organized complex visual arrays in patients with simultanagnosia with respect to the spatial properties of <b>local</b> <b>elements.</b> In detail, we investigated the role of the number and size of the <b>local</b> <b>elements</b> as well as their relationship with each other for the global perception. The findings indicate that global perception increases independently of the size of the global object and depends on the spatial relationship between the <b>local</b> <b>elements</b> and the global object. The results further argue against the possibility of a restriction in the attended or perceived area in simultanagnosia, in the sense that the integration of <b>local</b> <b>elements</b> into a global scene is impaired if a certain spatial “field of view” is exceeded. A possible explanation for these observations might be a shift from global to local saliency in simultanagnosia...|$|R

However, precisely what scene information each region represents is not clear, {{especially for the}} least studied, more posterior OPA. Here we hypothesized that OPA represents <b>local</b> <b>elements</b> of scenes within two independent, yet complementary scene descriptors: spatial boundary (i. e., the layout of external surfaces) and scene content (e. g., internal objects). If OPA processes the <b>local</b> <b>elements</b> of spatial boundary information, then it should respond to these <b>local</b> <b>elements</b> (e. g., walls) themselves, regardless of their spatial arrangement. Indeed, we found that OPA, but not PPA or RSC, responded similarly to images of intact rooms and these same rooms in which the surfaces were fractured and rearranged, disrupting the spatial boundary. Next, if OPA represents the <b>local</b> <b>elements</b> of scene content information, then it should respond more when more such <b>local</b> <b>elements</b> (e. g., furniture) are present. Indeed, we found that OPA, but not PPA or RSC, responded more to multiple than single pieces of furniture.

40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of different grouping cues (item density, number and connectedness) on the ability of a patient with simultanagnosia (GK) to identify compound stimuli. In Experiment 1, the effects of density and connectedness on the recognition of global and local forms were examined. In Experiment 2, the spatial distance of <b>local</b> <b>elements</b> was manipulated by varying the size of the global forms and the number of <b>local</b> <b>elements,</b> to assess whether the distance between the <b>local</b> <b>elements</b> or their number determined the effects on global/local processing in disconnected patterns. The results showed that high item density and connectedness, each facilitates the grouping of <b>local</b> <b>elements</b> into global shapes, determined the explicit recognition of global stimuli in simultanagnosia. Moreover, in addition to any bias to attend to the local level, there was also evidence for attentional capture by stimuli at the global level. The data indicate that grouping processes still operate in simultanagnosia and can overcome biases to select at a local level. Any biases in selection can also be compounded by poor attentional disengagement...|$|R

Effects of item familiarity were tested by examining local capture from Hebrew letters on compound English letters. Prior to training with the Hebrew letters, G. K. was able to identify the global compounds (Experiment 3 a). In contrast, after training with the letters, there was a significant increase in local capture (Experiment 3 b). Two additional experiments examined effects of local grouping. Local capture was reduced when the <b>local</b> <b>elements</b> were rectangles or ellipses and grouped by closure of <b>local</b> <b>elements</b> (Experiment 4). Global discrimination also improved when local items were unfamiliar rectangular figure eights (Experiment 5 a). However, these grouping effects were counteracted by effects of familiarity when the <b>local</b> <b>elements</b> were changed slightly to become familiar number eights (Experiment 5 b). The data suggest that familiar local items are likely to capture spatial attention, whilst grouping by closure between <b>local</b> <b>elements</b> can help global shapes compete for spatial attention with <b>local</b> <b>elements</b> in such patients.

40|$|International audiencePurpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present eight local elasto-plastic beam element {{formulations}} incorporated into the corotational framework for two-noded three-dimensional beams. These formulations capture the warping torsional effects of open cross-sections and are suitable for the analysis of the nonlinear buckling and post-buckling of thin-walled frames with generic cross-sections. The paper highlights the similarities and discrepancies between the different <b>local</b> <b>element</b> formulations. The primary goal of this study is to compare all the <b>local</b> <b>element</b> formulations in terms of accuracy, efficiency and CPU-running time. Design/methodology/approach - The definition of the corotational framework for a two-noded three-dimensional beam element is presented, based upon the works of Battini. The definitions of the <b>local</b> <b>element</b> kinematics and displacements shape functions are developed based on both Timoshenko and Bernoulli assumptions, and considering low-order as well as higher-order terms in the second-order approximation of the Green-Lagrange strains. Element forces interpolations and generalized stress resultant vectors are then presented for both mixed-based Timoshenko and Bernoulli formulations. Subsequently, the local internal force vector and tangent stiffness matrix are derived using the principle of virtual work for displacement-based elements and the two-field Hellinger-Reissner assumed stress variational principle for mixed-based formulations, respectively. A full comparison and assessment of the different <b>local</b> <b>element</b> models are performed by means of several numerical examples. Findings - In this study, it is shown that the higher order elements are more accurate than the low-order ones, and that the use of the higher order mixed-based Bernoulli element seems to require the least number of FEs to accurately model the structural behavior, and therefore allows some reduction of the CPU time compared to the other converged solutions; where a larger number of elements are needed to efficiently discretize the structure. Originality/value - The paper reports computation times for each model in order to assess their relative efficiency. The effect of the numbers of Gauss points along the element length and within the cross-section are also investigated...|$|E

40|$|Accurate motion {{perception}} {{of self and}} object speed is crucial for successful interaction in the world. The context in which we make such speed judgments has {{a profound effect on}} their accuracy. Misperceptions of motion speed caused by the context can have drastic consequences in real world situations, but they also reveal much about the underlying mechanisms of motion perception. Here we show that motion signals suppressed from awareness can warp simultaneous conscious speed perception. In Experiment 1, we measured global speed discrimination thresholds using an annulus of 8 <b>local</b> Gabor <b>elements.</b> We show that physically removing <b>local</b> <b>elements</b> from the array attenuated global speed discrimination. However, removing awareness of the <b>local</b> <b>elements</b> only had a small effect on speed discrimination. That is, unconscious <b>local</b> motion <b>elements</b> contributed to global conscious speed perception. In Experiment 2 we measured the global speed of the moving Gabor patterns, when half the elements moved at different speeds. We show that global speed averaging occurred regardless of whether <b>local</b> <b>elements</b> were removed from awareness, such that the speed of invisible elements continued to be averaged together with the visible elements to determine the global speed. These data suggest that contextual motion signals outside of awareness can both boost and affect our experience of motion speed, and suggest that such pooling of motion signals occurs before the conscious extraction of the surround motion speed...|$|R
40|$|Grouping <b>local</b> <b>elements</b> into a {{holistic}} percept, {{also known as}} spatial binding, is crucial for meaningful perception. Previous {{studies have shown that}} neurons in early visual areas V 1 and V 2 can signal complex grouping-related information, such as illusory contours or object-border ownerships. However, relatively little is known about higher-level processes contributing to these signals and mediating global Gestalt perception. We used a novel bistable motion illusion that induced alternating and mutually exclusive vivid conscious experiences of either dynamic illusory contours forming a global Gestalt or moving ungrouped <b>local</b> <b>elements</b> while the visual stimulation remained the same. fMRI in healthy human volunteers revealed that activity fluctuations in two sites of the parietal cortex, the superior parietal lobe and the anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS), correlated specifically with the perception of the grouped illusory Gestalt as opposed to perception of ungrouped <b>local</b> <b>elements.</b> We then disturbed activity at these two sites in the same participants using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS over aIPS led to a selective shortening of the duration of the global Gestalt percept, with no effect on that of <b>local</b> <b>elements.</b> The results suggest that aIPS activity is directly involved in the process of spatial binding during effortless viewing in the healthy brain. Conscious perception of global Gestalt is therefore associated with aIPS function, similar to attention and perceptual selection...|$|R
40|$|Patients with Balint' s {{syndrome}} {{are typically}} impaired at perceiving multiple objects simultaneously, and at evaluating {{the relationship between}} multiple objects in a scene (simultanagnosia). These deficits may not only be observed in complex scenes, but also when <b>local</b> <b>elements</b> of individual objects must be integrated into a perceptual global whole. Thus, unlike normal observers, patients with simultanagnosia typically show a bias towards the local forms, even {{to the extent that}} they cannot identify the global stimuli. However, we have previously shown that global processing is still attainable in Balint patients in certain scenarios (e. g., when <b>local</b> <b>elements</b> are unfamiliar). This suggests that in addition to a possible perceptual deficit that favors the <b>local</b> <b>elements</b> in these patients, impaired attentional control may be at the core of their unique performance. To test this hypothesis we manipulated the perceptual saliency of the <b>local</b> and global <b>elements</b> in a compound letter task so that it included global-more-salient or local-more-salient displays. We show that a Balint patient was able to accurately identify both global and local targets as long as they were the salient aspect of the compound letter. However, substantial impairment was evident when either the global or <b>local</b> <b>elements</b> were the less salient aspect of the compound letter. We conclude that in Balint' s syndrome there is a failure of flexible top-down attention both in biasing attention away from salient irrelevant aspects of the display (salience-based-selection) and in impaired disengagement from irrelevant but salient items once they have been selected...|$|R
