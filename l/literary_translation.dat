500|$|Wanted was {{initially}} {{set to be}} released in cinemas on March 28, 2008. However, in December 2007, Universal Pictures announced that it would be pushing back the release date to June 27, 2008, as the studio considered that the film had the potential to stand among the blockbusters that would be released during the United States summer. The film's world premiere happened at the Los Angeles Film Festival on June 19, with Wanted acting as the festival opener. Given the Russian origin of the director, Universal released a specially localized version in Russia. The <b>literary</b> <b>translation</b> of the English dialog was written by the writer Sergey Lukyanenko. Several texts appearing on the screen and important for the plot were translated using CGI, without using subtitles or a voice-over translation. Several famous Russian actors, most of which were also in Bekmambetov's Night Watch and Day Watch, dubbed the main characters, and Konstantin Khabensky dubbed himself as The Exterminator. James McAvoy also provided some words in Russian for Wesley Gibson. Danny Elfman's song [...] "The Little Things" [...] received a version in Russian, performed by Elfman himself, and Bekmambetov also directed a music video for the band Delta as part of a viral marketing campaign in Russia.|$|E

[...] Jack Kerouac would describe his writing in On the Road as a <b>literary</b> <b>translation</b> of the improvisations of Charlie Parker and Lester Young. The [...] "beatnik" [...] stereotype borrowed heavily from the dress and mannerisms of bebop musicians and followers, {{in particular the}} beret and lip beard of Dizzy Gillespie and the patter and bongo drumming of guitarist Slim Gaillard. [...] The bebop subculture, defined as a non-conformist group expressing its values through musical communion, would echo in {{the attitude of the}} psychedelia-era hippies of the 1960s. Fans of bebop were not restricted to the United States; the music also gained cult status in France and Japan.|$|E
