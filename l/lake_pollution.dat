40|$|Lobelia dortmanna leads a {{group of}} small, highly-valued rosette species that grow on coarse, nutrient-poor soils in {{temperate}} soft-water lakes. They acquire most CO 2 for photosynthesis by root uptake and efficient gas transport in large air channels to the leaves. Lobelia is the only species that releases virtually all photosynthetic oxygen from the roots and generates profound day-night changes in oxygen and CO 2 in the sediment pore-water. While oxygen release from roots stimulates decomposition and supports VA-mycorrhiza fungi, the ready gas exchange presents a risk of insufficient oxygen supply to the distal root meristems as sediments accumulate organic matter from <b>lake</b> <b>pollution.</b> So the plant with the greatest oxygen release from roots {{is also the most}} sensitive to oxygen depletion in sediments and it dies or losses anchorage by shortening the roots from 10 to 2 cm at even modest contents (2. 4 %) of degradable organic matter. Coatings of oxidized iron on roots in organically enriched sediments reduce radial oxygen loss and, thereby, increase internal concentrations and supply of oxygen to root tips. Oxidized iron is also a redox buffer which may prevent the ingress of sulfides and other reduced toxic solutes during nights. Controlled experiments are under way to test if iron enrichment can help survival of rosette species threatened by <b>lake</b> <b>pollution</b> or whether removal of organic surface sediments is required...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{new methods}} to analyse non-convex discrete time optimal control problems. A distinctive feature of such problems is that indifference states may occur: these are initial states at which several optimising trajectories originate. In the thesis, the genesis of such points through indifference-attractor bifurcations is studied as system parameters are varied. This necessitates an analysis of heteroclinic bifurcation scenarios of the state-costate dynamics. In particular, {{it is found that}} infinitely many indifference points exist at certain parameter values, or, equivalently, that the associated value function is not differentiable at infinitely many points in state space. The results make it possible to analyse the bifurcation structure of the discrete-time <b>lake</b> <b>pollution</b> management problem...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Many lakes are {{receiving}} {{large volumes of}} contaminants from agricultural discharges, industrial emissions and municipal wastewater, which causes significant surface water pollution. The adverse environmental and health effects of lake contamination are a primary concern in environmental management. Water quality assessment methods and pollution control planning models are useful tools for researchers and decision-makers to protect ecological environments and develop local economies. Also spatial information technologies such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) {{make it possible to}} manage water bodies with more detailed location-based information. The goal of this thesis is to develop a GIS-based water quality assessment and pollution control planning approach for lake management (WQAPCP), which includes the following components: (1) evaluation of water quality based on four index methods with inter-comparisons; (2) pollution control planning for a lake system based on an integration of pollutant distribution simulation and optimization models along with water quality index measures; (3) GIS technology to help implementing water quality assessment and lake contamination control optimization by creating displayed maps of the study results to provide spatial support for decisions. Several water quality evaluation methods are first presented in this thesis within the GIS framework to examine water quality index models, including the US Oregon water quality index (OWQI), the Canadian water quality index (CWQI), the Chinese single-factor water quality index (CNWQI-S) and the Chinese comprehensive water quality index (CNWQI-C) methods. These index methods are applied to assess the water quality of a real case. The assessment results are presented in the form of GIS maps containing the spatial distribution of the water quality levels and their ranking. Through an example of sensitivity analysis and comparison of four sets of water quality assessment results, the parameters with the most significant influence on lake water quality are identified and the most suitable method of water quality evaluation is put forward to support future lake management. Subsequently, this thesis develops a simulation-optimization approach by integrating lake water quality simulation and <b>lake</b> <b>pollution</b> control optimization. A contaminant dispersion simulation is first conducted to provide input for the optimization study. Particularly, a single-objective programming (SOP) model and a multi-objective programming (MOP) model are developed, applied, and compared to support effective lake water contamination control planning under different lake management scenarios. Three periods and a set of significant levels are considered in the real case study to provide a comprehensive dynamic modeling and optimization analysis of <b>lake</b> <b>pollution</b> control through the simulation-optimization approach. Based on the developed optimization method and the case study results, the OWQI and CNWQI-C methods are utilized to help formulating the effective measures for lake water quality management. GIS technology is employed in this study to link the water quality assessment approaches and the <b>lake</b> <b>pollution</b> control optimization. By integrating the relevant data and creating visualized maps of the study results, GIS {{plays an important role in}} extending the modeling and assessment results for the lake water quality management with spatial geo-references...|$|E
40|$|Lake Washington {{is arguably}} the most famous case study of <b>lake</b> <b>pollution</b> and {{subsequent}} recovery, and the widely cited story implicates just a few major players in the lake’s food web transformations. ‘‘The Lake Washington story’ ’ historically highlights key players that negatively affect other taxa—filamentous cyanobacteria, the influential grazer Daphnia, and its predator Neomysis. This food web model has been based variously on experiments, observation, and educated inference. Here we tested the robustness of that historical conceptual model in a single multivariate analysis of long-term data. Most aspects of the historical model are supported, but the analysis also suggests key roles for food resources not previously considered—the nutritious cryptomonads and ubiquitous picoplankton. This cohesive analysis helps align the historical model with recent studies emphasizing ‘‘bottom-up’ ’ controls in Lake Washington and similar systems, and demonstrates the usefulness of using long-term data analysis to validate results from traditional ecological approaches...|$|E
