40|$|Temperature {{programmed}} {{gas chromatography}} (TPGC) {{is commonly used}} {{for the analysis of}} complex samples {{with a wide range of}} boiling points. It is estimated that 80 % of GC users implement TPGC on a regular basis. 1 In 1962, John Calvin Giddings was the first to publish a simple model for TPGC. 2 His theories concerning TPGC are still accepted as the benchmark for explaining the underlying theory. The purpose of this research was to investigate, as speculated by Giddings, if temperature programming rate (β) is the dominant contribution in determining fundamental chromatographic values, such as retention time, retention temperature and resolution. Comparison of these effects was made by studying column length and linear velocity in conjunction with temperature programming rates. Experimental determinations using a combination of three different column lengths, five linear velocities and three ramping rates on a three-component sample were investigated.

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the separation of}} the main component kanamycin A from its related substances using an improved liquid chromatographic method with pulsed electrochemical detection (LC-PED). Two methods, one using volatile ion pairing agents and the other using non-volatile ones were developed. Using volatile additives, the total run time was rather long with no possibility of developing gradient elution. The non-volatile method was found to be more performant and hence was selected for further quantitative work. This method employed gradient elution {{in order to reduce the}} analysis time and to improve the sensitivity of the <b>late</b> <b>eluting</b> <b>peaks.</b> Mobile phase A consisted of sodium sulphate (5. 0 g/l), sodium octanesulphonate (0. 5 g/l) and 0. 2 M phosphate buffer pH 3. 0 (50. 0 ml/l). Mobile phase B was the same as A except for the amount of sodium sulphate which was increased to 15 g/l. Using a Platinum EPS column (150 mm x 4. 6 mm ID, 3 mu m) kept at 45 degrees C, 22 components could be separated within 45 min indicating that this method is much more selective than other already published ones. Robustness of the method was examined by means of an experimental design. The limit of detection and limit of quantitation were found to be 1. 7 and 5 ng, respectively. The method was found to be linear in the range LOQ- 600 ng injected with a coefficient of determination equal to 0. 999. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Arachidonic acid (20 : 4 (n- 6)), {{which is}} {{released}} by cells {{responding to a}} wide range of stimuli, may play an important role in intracellular signaling. We now report that incubation of WB cells with 20 : 4 (n- 6) resulted in the appearance of several tyrosine-phosphorylated cytosolic proteins. Two of the phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, migrating in SDS-polyacrylamide gels of approximately 43 and 45 kDa, corresponded in mobility to phosphorylated species of the 42 - and 44 -kDa mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) isoforms. Immunoblots of soluble fractions from unstimulated WB cells with anti-MAPK antibodies revealed the presence of the 42 - and 44 -kDa isoforms of MAPK. Upon incubation with 20 : 4 (n- 6), the mobility of both isoforms was retarded, consistent with their activation by phosphorylation. Chromatography of soluble fractions from these cells on Mono Q columns revealed early and <b>late</b> <b>eluting</b> <b>peaks</b> of myelin basic protein kinase activity, which contained the 42 - and 44 -kDa MAPK isoforms, respectively. Activation of MAPK was transient, peaking at 5 min, and was detectable at 5 microM 20 : 4 (n- 6). Further studies into the mechanisms by which MAPK was activated by 20 : 4 (n- 6) strongly suggested the involvement of protein kinase C (PKC). Not only did incubation of WB cells with 20 : 4 (n- 6) result in the translocation of PKC alpha, delta, and epsilon to a particulate fraction, it was found that the fatty acid failed to activate MAPK in cells pretreated for 26 h with phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate, which depleted WB cells of PKC alpha, delta and epsilon. In addition, fatty acids of the n- 3 series were effective activators of MAPK. The present study, to our knowledge, is the first to report that polyunsaturated fatty acids can cause the activation of MAPK. Charles S. T. Hii, Antonio Ferrante, Yasmin S. Edwards, Zhi H.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{represents the}} study and integration of column switching {{in the analysis of}} biological and environmental compounds. Areas of study in this work include: the determination of MHPG in human urine, the determination of atrazine and its degradation products in water, studies of binding site heterogeneity in split-peak chromatography and chromatographic immunoassays, and optimization of a chemiluminescent reaction for use in HPLC post-column detection. ^ The studies with MHPG (3 -methoxy- 4 -hydroxyphenylethylene glycol) resulted in a method for determination of total and free MHPG in urine using reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) with electrochemical detection. The chromatographic separation was made faster by the using of column switching to remove any <b>late</b> <b>eluting</b> <b>peaks</b> that would increase analysis time significantly. ^ The determination of atrazine and its degradation products used of column switching to couple, high performance immunoaffinity chromatography (HPIAC) and RPLC. The results of the HPIAC/RPLC method agreed well with the results of a reference GC/MS method. In addition, the HPIAC/RPLC was shown to be able to quantitate these compounds at the parts-per-trillion range in water. ^ The theoretical studies of heterogeneity showed that binding site variations can affect split-peak adsorption behavior. Simulations suggested a linear equation describing such behavior. Simulations and experiments showed that the presence of a slow binding site decreases the amount of solute adsorbed to the column under all conditions. ^ For a sequential addition immunoassay (SAIA), computer simulations predicted that heterogeneity results in a larger dynamic range for sample quantitation. However, heterogeneity generally resulted in small changes in the assay results versus those obtained in homogeneous assays. Thus heterogeneity in the stationary phase, should not be a great hindrance in the use and performance of these assays. ^ The last topic, the optimization of the chemiluminescence reaction of acridinium esters for post-column determinations was performed for the detection of labeled compounds can be determined at sub-attomole levels. The optimal levels determined for phenyl acridinium esters were 1 M sodium hydroxide, 0. 02 % (w/v) hydrogen peroxide and 1 % (w/v) Triton X- 100. In addition, the post-column system gave optimal behavior if a total flow rate greater than 3. 0 mL/min was used for the post-column reaction mixture. ...|$|R

Lysyl-tRNA species from spores and the asporogenous mutant in stationary phase both exhibited altered chromatographic profiles {{compared to that of}} log-phase cells. The major peak in spore lysyl-tRNA species eluted later than that characteristic of vegetative cells, whereas the major peak of the lysyl-tRNA species from the asporogenous mutant in stationary phase eluted earlier. Although the early eluting lysyl-tRNA species was observable on methylated albumin columns, the <b>late</b> <b>eluting</b> <b>peak</b> was not detectable by that column technique. By using a shallower gradient on an RPC- 2 column, the resolution of all lysyl-tRNA species increased. Several subspecies were revealed. The chromatographic comparisons clearly show that both the spore-forming strain and the asporogenous mutant undergo relative increases in different lysyl-tRNA species when grown to late stationary phase. No new species seem to be involved but rather altered amounts of minor species existing in log-phase cells. The experiments also demonstrate the usefulness of reversed-phase columns for such comparisons...|$|E
40|$|When human, canine, or bovine factor VIII {{preparations}} are chromatographed on 4 % agarose at {{ionic strength}} 0. 2, the factor VIII activity elutes {{as a single}} peak in the void volume with slight tailing. Incubation of such preparations with dilute (0. 01 U/ml) highly purified thrombin results in some activation of factor VIII. Chromatography of such incubation mixtures, under the same conditions as before, results in elution of two peaks of factor VIII activity one in the void volume and one much later with marked tailing. The void volume peak has most of the protein and some factor VIII activity. These void volume fractions also contain all the von Willebrand factor activity of thrombin-treated bovine preparations. Longer treatment with thrombin, or treatment with stronger thrombin, appears to shift much more of the procoagulant activity to the later eluting peak. Also, when the peak of factor VIII activity, found in the void volume after thrombin treatment, was again incubated with dilute thrombin, an increase in factor VIII activity occurred. Chromatography of this incubation mixture demonstrated {{only a small amount}} of activity in the void volume, while the bulk of the activity was present in the second peak. On the other hand, thrombin treatment of factor VIII activity from peak 2 caused a rapid decline of activity instead of a further increase. It is proposed that the residual factor VIII activity found in the void volume represents unreacted factor VIII, while the <b>late</b> <b>eluting</b> <b>peak</b> represents thrombin-activated material that is of smaller apparent size. The <b>late</b> <b>eluting</b> <b>peak</b> differs from the small active factor VIII fragment obtained by Ca 2 + dissociation, as the latter can be activated by thrombin. A similar set of experiments was performed using ultracentifugation of bovine factor VIII preparations on sucrose density gradients. Results of these experiments agreed completely with those obtained with get chromatography. Preparations made from human hemophilic plasma, by the procudure employed in the purification of human factor VIII, were also incubated with thrombin and chromatographed. von Willebrand factor was again found only in the void volume fractions, but there was no factor VIII activity in any fractions eluted. In other control experiments, activated and unactivated factor VIII fractions did not clot fibrinogen and contained no assayable factor IX or X.

40|$|Environmental {{pollutants}} can {{be found}} in many ecosystems and cover many different compound classes. The Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for monitoring and regulating several of these classes of compounds which daily enter the environment. However, there are still hundreds, if not thousands, of compounds present in the environment which have yet to be regulated or even identified. The discovery and identification of these unknown emerging pollutants is crucial for the prevention of potential human health risks and irreversible ecological damage. The research presented is divided into two projects. The first part of this research investigates the disinfectant 3 -Bromo- 1 -chloro- 5, 5 -dimethylhydantoin, which is often used in the treatment of hot tubs. Treating the water with this chemical is intended to protect the swimmer from harmful bacteria that may be present in the water. However, the reaction of the disinfectant with other organic compounds found in the water can lead to the formation of potentially toxic disinfection by-products. The use of thermal desorption negative chemical ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry allows for a wider range of compounds to be ionized than conventional gas or liquid chromatography. The high resolution mass data were used to infer a molecular formula {{that could be used in}} database searches to find potential structural matches. The mass spectra indicated the presence of ions containing one and two bromine atoms. The second study investigated the oxidation of the prevalent environmental contaminant triclosan. Triclosan is known to oxidize to form 2, 4 -dichlorophenol, which is carcinogenic and displays some estrogenic activity. While other oxidation products have been hypothesized, such as other dichlorophenols, none have been positively identified. Analysis of reactions of triclosan and hydrogen peroxide at high pH indicate the presence of three compounds that appear to all be dichlorophenols. One compound has been identified as 2, 4 -dichlorophenol. Additionally, 2, 5 -dichlorophenol and 3, 4 -dichlorophenol have been identified. A <b>late</b> <b>eluting</b> <b>peak</b> has fragmentation consistent with the dichlorophenols. However, it does not coelute with the dichlorophenol standards. This compound is hypothesized to be a semi-quinone. The effects of pH on the oxidation product profile of triclosan are also presented...|$|E

Two strains of MDCK cells were used. MDCK I cells resemble distal tubule epithelial cells, and MDCK II cells share some characteristics with proximal tubule cells. Both strains were grown to confluency and labelled with [35 S]sulphate for 24 h. The apical and basolateral media and the cell fractions were harvested and analysed by DEAE ion-exchange chromatography. A {{large portion of the}} [35 S]sulphate-labelled macromolecules bound strongly to the ion-exchange columns, and could be eluted in three distinct <b>peaks.</b> The <b>latest</b> <b>eluting</b> <b>peak</b> was demonstrated to contain almost exclusively chondroitin sulphate, whereas peak 2 contained mostly heparan sulphate, demonstrated by using chondroitinase ABC and nitrous acid (pH 1. 5) respectively to depolymerize the [35 S]glycosaminoglycan chains. Peak 1 contained negligible amounts of proteoglycans. Large differences could be observed in proteoglycan sorting in MDCK I and II cells. Strain I secreted approx. 67 % of the proteoglycans to the apical side and 17 % to the basolateral side. The cell fraction contained 17 % of the proteoglycans after 24 h of labelling. In contrast, 19 % of the proteoglycans were sorted to the apical side of MDCK II cells and 61 % to the basolateral side, whereas the cell fraction contained 20 %. Furthermore, the level of [35 S]proteoglycan biosynthesis (apical and basolateral media and cell fraction total) was higher in MDCK I cells than in strain II. Based on the amount of material degraded by chondroitinase ABC and nitrous acid respectively, and the total amounts of [35 S]proteoglycans recovered from the cells, it was calculated that the MDCK I strain synthesized approx. 56 % chondroitin sulphate and 44 % heparan sulphate. In contrast, the MDCK II strain synthesized 69 % heparan sulphate and 31 % chondroitin sulphate. To further identify the [35 S]proteoglycans synthesized by MDCK I and II cells, antibodies against perlecan, versican and syndecan were used. The antibody against mouse syndecan did not cross-react with any of the proteoglycans produced in MDCK I or II cells. Both MDCK I and II cells expressed perlecan; 57 - 61 % could be recovered from the basolateral fractions and 18 - 34 % from the apical medium. Versican was also found in both MDCK I and II cells. Compared with perlecan, a larger percentage of versican (43 - 53 %) was found in the cell fractions...|$|R

40|$|Human {{haemoglobin}} (Hb) {{may appear}} {{in a number of}} glycated species. The glycation pattern of Hb using shielding boronate affinity chromatography (SBAC) has been studied in the present work. SBAC is a novel separation technique, which eliminates nonspecific boronate-protein interactions by introducing a so-called shielding reagent [1, 2]. Two samples from Bio-Rad (Lyphochek(R)) -one from normal persons' blood with relatively low HbA(1 c) level (HbL) and the other from diabetic patients' blood with an elevated HbA(1 c) level (HbH) -were used for the investigation. Glycated Hb (GHb) was separated from nonglycated Hb species using Tris as the shielding reagent. Two <b>eluted</b> <b>peaks,</b> <b>eluted</b> <b>peak</b> 1 (E 1) and <b>eluted</b> <b>peak</b> 2 (E 2), were obtained using a linear gradient elution with Tris. Several bands were observed on isoelectric focusing gel, which showed the same migration positions as Hb adducts, such as HbA(o), which is major Hb component containing two alpha chains and two beta chains; HbA(1 c) which is post-translational glycation on the N-terminus of the beta chains of HbA(o); Foetal Hb (HbF), consisting of two alpha chains and two gamma chains; and glutathione Hb (also called HbSSG), which is the result from thiol-disulphide interchain exchange during oxidation of the thiol groups of Hb. In both HbL and HbH samples, E 2 exhibited slightly higher amounts of HbF than E 1. Electrospray-ionisation mass spectrometry showed that: (1) HbL-E 1 was glycated with single glucose on both alpha and beta chains while no observable glycated chains were present in HbL-E 2; (2) both HbH-E 1 and HbH-E 2 were glycated with single glucoses on both alpha and beta chains, however, compared with HbH-E 1, HbH-E 2 showed a higher relative intensity of the glycated beta chain and lower relative intensity of the glycated alpha chain; and (3) the degree of glycation increased with increasing glycation level of the sample. The amount of HbA(1 c) presented in the <b>eluted</b> <b>peaks</b> was further determined using enzymatic digestion of glycated Hb by endoproteinase Glu-C and the subsequent separation and analysis of the digested peptides by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis.

Then, HPLC, capillary electrophoresis, peptide sequencing, and mass spectrometry were used to identify five peptides from αS 1 -casein (CN), one from β-CN, and one from αS 2 -CN that accumulated in 6 -mo-old cheeses. Most of the peptides derived from αS 1 -CN (f 1 – 23) accumulated {{in a manner that}} corresponded with starter proteinase specificity. All of the peptides identified in the study except αS 2 -CN (f 1 – 21) eluted in the O-P-Q region of micellar electrokinetic capillary electropherograms. The αS 1 -CN (f 1 – 16), αS 1 -CN (f 1 – 17) and β-CN (f 193 - 209) <b>eluted</b> in <b>peak</b> O, αS 1 -CN (f 1 – 13) and αS 1 -CN (f 1 – 14) <b>eluted</b> in <b>peak</b> P, and αS 1 -CN (f 1 – 9) <b>eluted</b> in <b>peak</b> Q...|$|R
30|$|To {{evaluate}} the robustness {{of the developed}} method, the chromatographic conditions were deliberately altered and the resolution between closely <b>eluting</b> <b>peak</b> pair i.e. Imp-D and Lafutidine was evaluated. The flow rate of the mobile phase was 0.5 mL min- 1. To study the effect of flow rate on the resolution, the same was altered by 0.1 units i.e. from 0.4 to 0.6 mL min- 1. The effect of column temperature on resolution was studied at 32 °C and 38 °C instead of 35 °. All the other mobile phase components were held constant as described above. In all the deliberate varied chromatographic conditions (flow rate and column temperature), the tailing factor of Lafutidine was less than 1.30 and the resolution between any two peaks was greater than 2.0. There was a very minor variation in the resolution and tailing factor results observed in all the robustness conditions illustrating the robustness of the method.|$|R
30|$|Recoveries {{obtained}} were in {{the range}} of 84 to 110  % for the chloride and sulphate spiked samples. These data were within the range EPA 314.0 [18] defined for the recovery acceptance criterion of 85 to 115  %. In contrast to the producer’s recommendation, the cartridges were applied to more than one sample. The criterion applied was the chromatographic resolution (R) between perchlorate and the next <b>eluting</b> <b>peak</b> (R ≥  1.3). As long as this criterion was fulfilled, the chromatogram was integrated and the cartridge was used. In case of lower resolution—an indirect indication of lower matrix ion removal due to the exhaustive use of the cartridge—the original sample was treated with a new cartridge. The effect of sample preparation can be seen in Fig.  1, comparing the chromatogram of an untreated and the one of a treated sample. The removal of matrix anions proved to be beneficial for both the chromatographic behaviour as well as the recovery (Table  3).|$|R
40|$|Vanadate ions {{are shown}} to inhibit horseradish, squash, and rat {{intestinal}} peroxidases {{by following the}} reaction spectrophotometrically {{in a wide range}} of vanadate concentrations. I 50 in phosphate buffer were 43, 9. 4, and 535 microM, respectively. No inhibitory effect was found on cow milk lactoperoxidase and beef liver catalase. Gel filtration of peroxidases in the presence of vanadate, as carried out by radioactive 48 V for horseradish peroxidases (either in aerobic or anoxic conditions) and neutron activation analysis (NAA) for squash peroxidase, demonstrated a binding of vanadium to these enzymes in stoichiometric amounts. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of the <b>eluted</b> <b>peaks</b> for the former peroxidase indicated that vanadium is in the + 5 oxidation state, but an equilibrium between V (V) and V (IV) in the assay conditions cannot be discarded. Although the inhibitory mechanism remains obscure, some hypotheses are considered. The potential implications that the inhibitory effect of vanadium might have on plant and animal metabolism are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using an {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometer as a muitieiement detector for flow injection analysis (FIA) and ion-pair reversed-phase liquid chromatography was investigated. Sample introduction was by uitrasonk nebulization with aerosol desolvation. Absolute detecton limits for FIA ranged from 0. 01 to 0. 1 ng for most elements using 10 -pL injections. Over 30 elements were surveyed for their response to both anionic and cationic ion pairing reagents. The separation and selective detection of various As and Se species were demonstrated, yielding detection limits near 0. 1 ng (as element) for ail six species present. Determination of 15 elements in a single injection with multiple ion monitoring produced shniiar detection limits. Isotope ratios were measured with sufficient precision (better than 2 %) and accuracy (about 1 %) on <b>eluting</b> <b>peaks</b> of Cd and Pb to demonstrate that liquid chromatographyhductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry should make speciation studies with stable tracer isotopes feasible...|$|R
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{for the evaluation}} of the stability of chlortetracycline (CTC) in granular premixes is described. This methodology is based on the monitoring of the conversion of CTC into its degradation products by an improved gradient liquid chromatography (LC) method, based on one previously described by our laboratory. Sample preparation involves the extraction of CTC and its degradation products prior to LC analysis, using acidified methanol as extraction solvent. The gradient elution LC method proved to be very sensitive, especially towards the <b>late</b> <b>eluting</b> anhydro derivatives. The use of a Hypersil C 8 BDS, 5 microm, 250 mm x 4. 6 mm i. d. column is recommended since this column allowed a complete separation of the different impurities from each other and from the main component CTC. The applicability of this approach was demonstrated by the analysis of stability samples. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Ionspray triple {{quadrupole}} {{mass spectrometry}} and {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} were used to investigate the products from the solid phase synthesis of (H) -Leu-Thr-Glu-Asn-(OH), a TNF-alpha active-site probe. The target sequence was assembled using tert. -butoxycarbonyl (Boc) chemistry in stepwise fashion from the C-terminal on an Boc-Asn-OCH 2 -Pam-copoly(styrene-divinylbenzene) resin [Pam= 4 -(carboxamidomethyl) benzyl ester]. The crude product was deprotected and cleaved from the resin by HF-p-cresol treatment for 1 h at 0 -degrees-C. HPLC analysis at 214 nm indicated two late-eluting major products and an early-eluting product. Preparative HPLC demonstrated that the early-eluting product contained ca. 80 % of the expected recovered sample mass. Each component was then directly analysed by mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry. The early <b>eluting</b> <b>peak</b> was confirmed as the desired LTEN sequence. Synthesis of the same sequence using 9 -fluorenyl methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry gave an identical product and confirmed the above analysis. The most significant by-product was derived from arylation of the glutamyl group by the quencher p-cresol. The likely origins of the by-products are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Benzodiazepines {{are among}} the most {{prescribed}} drugs for the treatment of a wide spectrum of clinical disorders. They have been used as anticonvulsants, anxiolytics, hypnotics or muscle relaxants with different durations of action. In this paper, the determination of six frequently used benzodiazepines and metabolites: flunitrazepam, oxazepam, alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and desmethyldiazepam in serum was developed by high-per-formance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with solid phase extraction (SPE). Quantification was performed with gradient elution of a C 8 reversed- phase column, with an alkaline water-acetonitrile-methanol eluent, free of buffer salts. Carbamazepine was detected as an internal standard by ultraviolet absorbance at 239 nm. The determination of flunitrazepam, oxazepam, alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, desmethyldiazepam and diazepam was possible in a concen-tration range of 250 - 4, 000 ng/mL, and the mean recovery by this analysis was 91, 91, 93, 84, 110 and 92 %, respectively. This method allows rapid detection, a purity check, identifica-tion, and quantitation of the <b>eluting</b> <b>peaks.</b> Sensitivity and specificity data are acceptable. The validated procedure has been applied routinely in forensic toxicological analysis. Chiang Mai Med J 2007; 46 (1) : 23 - 30...|$|R
40|$|Caseins {{and many}} other {{secretory}} proteins are phosphorylated during their transport through the secretory pathway by a protein kinase present within Golgi compartments. Molecular analysis of the Golgi casein kinase (GCK) has not been possible since {{it has not been}} purified to homogeneity or been cloned. Previous {{attempts have been made to}} purify GCK activity from mammary gland Golgi fractions, but these have not resulted in extensive purification of the enzyme. In the present study, we have demonstrated that substantial amounts of GCK activity, assayed using a specific peptide substrate, can be detected as a soluble form in bovine milk, and we have used milk as a source for purification. A purification protocol was established that allowed> 80000 -fold purification to a specific activity of GCK (approx. 700 nmoles/min per mg of protein) far higher than previously achieved. These findings cast doubts on previous claims for purification of GCK activity. In addition, ion-exchange chromatography resolved two closely <b>eluting</b> <b>peaks</b> of activity, suggesting the existence of two related, but distinct, GCK activities...|$|R
