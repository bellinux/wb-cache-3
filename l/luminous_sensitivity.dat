2500|$|GEN-III OMNI-V - VII devices can {{differ from}} {{standard}} Generation 3 {{in one or}} both of two important ways. First, an automatic gated power supply system regulates the photocathode voltage, allowing the NVD to instantaneously adapt to changing light conditions. The second is a removed or greatly thinned ion barrier, which decreases the number of electrons that are usually rejected by the Standard GEN III MCP, hence resulting in less image noise and the ability to operate with a <b>luminous</b> <b>sensitivity</b> at 2,850K of only 700, compared to operating with a <b>luminous</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of at least 1,800 for GEN III image intensifiers. [...] The disadvantage to a thin or removed ion barrier is the overall decrease in tube life from a theoretical 20,000 hrs mean time to failure (MTTF) for Gen III type, to 15,000 hrs MTTF for GEN IV type. However, this is largely negated by the low number of image intensifier tubes that reach 15,000 hrs of operation before replacement.|$|E
40|$|This note {{describe}} {{a method to}} estimate the R 5900 PMT's 480 nm quantum efficiency, using only measurements of "white" and "blue" photocathode <b>luminous</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> The method had been first tested on two PMT for which the full spectral characteristics are available. One of these PMT's corresponds to a "typical" R 5900, {{and the other to}} a non "typical" one in point of view of its characteristics. The method had been then applied to the set of 65 PMT's used in Module 0. Cross check of the 480 nm quantum efficiency estimation are performed using 480 nm DC light photocathode sensitivity already measured for these PMT's previously to their use in Module 0. 1.

40|$|The {{performance}} characteristics {{of an image}} dissector coupled to an echelle grating spectrometer for simulta-neous multielement determinations by atomic absorption are presented here. Because the image dissector and echelle grating spectrometer are not commonly used in clinical practice, the basic concepts and characteristics of these components are discussed. A comparison with a silicon target vidicon suggests that the image dissector has a <b>luminous</b> <b>sensitivity</b> that is 130 to 190 times {{greater than that of}} the vidicon. Multielement detection limits for Cu, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni with the image dissector/echelle spectrometer are lower than with the silicon vidicon by a factor ranging from four to 27, and are comparable to, or better than, single-element detection limits reported for a silicon vidicon and conventional optics.

40|$|The {{absolute}} light sensitivities, temporal properties, and spectral sensitivities of {{the visual}} systems of three mid-Atlantic temperate reef fishes (Atlantic spadefish [Ephippidae: Chaetodipterus faber], tautog [Labridae: Tautoga onitis], and black sea bass [Serranidae: Centropristis striata]) were studied via electroretinography (ERG). Pelagic Atlantic spadefish exhibited higher temporal resolution but a narrower dynamic range than the two more demersal foragers. The higher <b>luminous</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of tautog and black sea bass were similar to other benthic and demersal coastal mid-Atlantic fishes. Flicker fusion frequency experiments revealed significant interspecific differences at maximum intensities that correlated with lifestyle and habitat.

40|$|Summary The {{absolute}} light sensitivities, temporal properties, and spectral sensitivities of {{the visual}} systems of three mid-Atlantic temperate reef fishes (Atlantic spadefish [Ephippidae: Chaetodipterus faber], tautog [Labridae: Tautoga onitis], and black sea bass [Serranidae: Centropristis striata]) were studied via electroretinography (ERG). Pelagic Atlantic spadefish exhibited higher temporal resolution but a narrower dynamic range than the two more demersal foragers. The higher <b>luminous</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of tautog and black sea bass were similar to other benthic and demersal coastal mid-Atlantic fishes. Flicker fusion frequency experiments revealed significant interspecific differences at maximum intensities that correlated with lifestyle and habitat. Spectral responses of the three species spanned 400 – 610  nm, with high likelihood of cone dichromacy providing the basis for color and contrast discrimination. Significant day-night differences in spectral responses were evident in spadefish and black sea bass but not tautog, a labrid with characteristic structure-associated nocturnal torpor. Atlantic spadefish responded to {{a wider range of}} wavelengths than did deeper-dwelling tautog or black sea bass. Collectively, these results suggest that temperate reef-associated fishes are well-adapted to their gradient of brighter to dimmer photoclimates, representative of their unique ecologies and life histories. Continuing anthropogenic degradation of water quality in coastal environments, at a pace faster than the evolution of visual systems, may however impede visual foraging and reproductive signaling in temperate reef fishes...|$|R
40|$|A new {{approach}} to analog VLSI implementations of algorithms for visual cortical processing is presented. Specifically, we introduce a massively parallel architecture, organized as a planar resistive network with voltage controlled current generators locally connected to model interaction schemata responsible of specific sensitivities in cortical neurons. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by designing and simulating a 24 Θ 24 nodes analog module implementing Gaborlike oriented receptive fields, {{that can be used}} in machine vision real time systems to evidence texture differences. 1 Introduction Visual information is processed in a number of successive stages. In mammals, ascending the visual pathway, more and more complex functions are performed, going from <b>luminous</b> contrast <b>sensitivity,</b> in the retina, up to symbolic information extraction, in the visual cortex. Cortical neurons exhibit sharp sensitivity to microstructures in an image, such as simple oriented edges l [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We used {{electroretinography}} (ERG) {{to determine}} spectral and luminous sensitivities, and the temporal resolution (flicker fusion frequency, FFF) in three sympatric (but phylogenetically distant) coastal shark species: Carcharhinus plumbeus (sandbar shark), Mustelus canis (smooth dogfish), and Squalus acanthias (spiny dogfish). Spectral sensitivities were similar (range ~ 400 – 600 nm, peak sensitivity ~ 470 nm), {{with a high}} likelihood of rod/cone dichromacy enhancing contrast discrimination. Spiny dogfish were significantly less light sensitive than the other species, whereas their FFF was ~ 19 Hz at maximum intensities; a value {{equal to that of}} sandbar shark and significantly above that of smooth dogfish (~ 9 – 12 Hz). This occurred even though experiments on spiny dogfish were conducted at 12 versus 25 °C and 20 °C for experiments on sandbar shark and smooth dogfish, respectively. Although spiny dogfish have a rod-dominated retina (rod:cone ratio 50 : 1), their visual system appears to have evolved for a relatively high temporal resolution (i. e., high FFF) through a short integration time, with the requisite concomitant reduction in <b>luminous</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> Our results suggest adaptive plasticity in the temporal resolution of elasmobranch visual systems which reflects the importance of the ability to track moving objects such as mates, predators, or prey...|$|E
40|$|Designers {{are often}} asked {{to gauge the}} {{influence}} of an illuminant or a visual signal on the human eye in a particular application. It {{has long been known}} that physical measurement is insufficient for this purpose. This is, in part, because the human sense of vision is not equipped with a competent radiation detector that is independent of wavelength. "The ability to see is a partnership of light and sight [...] . " Photometry, a specification computed from a radiometric measurement, was developed as an attempt to capture what is human about human vision so that the sterile specifications of radiometry might be thus rendered more useful as a predictive tool. As it has developed and matured, photometry has become an exacting tool requiring sometimes extraordinary attention to detail that lies beyond the experience of many of us. But even with appropriate attention to detail, photometry takes account only of the spectral distribution of radiation in comparison to the spectral <b>sensitivity</b> (<b>luminous</b> efficiency) of the observer, {{and the size of the}} pupil. These characteristics of vision arise early in the perceptual chain. Other features of human vision, which vision science is beginning to systematically quantify, may be viewed as additional signposts pointing to the need for a more thorough humanization of radiometry. Visual illusions provide an example as do a variety of visual effects in which the percept is not veridical. This paper will review selected characteristics of human vision that point to the need for moving beyond photometry. Two examples, one involving the use of LED illuminants in traffic signals, and the other showing the theoretical advantages of a modified wing-tip strobe, will be used to illustrate the problem area. It is possible to foresee a future in which designers could use a photometric correction incorporating these additional factors...|$|R
