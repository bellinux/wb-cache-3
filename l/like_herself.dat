5|$|Alfre Woodard {{was cast}} as Lily Sloane, Cochrane's assistant. When Frakes {{first moved to}} Los Angeles, Woodard {{was one of the}} first people he met. During a {{conversation}} at a barbecue, Woodard said she would become Frakes' godmother, as he did not have one. Through this relationship, Frakes was able to cast Woodard in the film; he considered it a coup to land an Academy Award-nominated actress. Woodard considered Lily to be the character most <b>like</b> <b>herself</b> out of all the roles she has played.|$|E
5|$|Before Lauper {{covered the}} song, the band The Cars {{produced}} {{an early version}} of it that was not released. Shear's version was originally a folk rock song, but Lauper instead turned it into a pop ballad for her album, with a heavy emphasis on a synthesizer. According to Lauper, she wanted it to be just like Shear's version, with a bit more of an acoustic sound. However, she changed her mind, saying that she wanted to sing it <b>like</b> <b>herself.</b> Unlike her other singles from the album, this one did not have a music video released with it.|$|E

She also branded Bridget as a 'sporty tomboy'. During an interview, Mignon said that Bridget's relationship with Declan changes her and she feels more independent from her family. She also becomes more determined as a person.|$|E

5|$|During the Obama presidency, some {{progressive}} {{lawyers and}} activists called for Ginsburg to retire so Obama {{would be able}} to appoint a like-minded successor, particularly while the Democratic Party held control of the U.S. Senate. They pointed to Ginsburg's age and past health issues as factors making her longevity uncertain. Ginsburg rejected these pleas. She affirmed her wish to remain a justice as long as she was mentally sharp enough to perform her duties. Moreover, Ginsburg opined that the political climate would prevent Obama from appointing a jurist <b>like</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|E
5|$|The ballet {{has been}} {{variously}} interpreted and adapted. The 1917 Russian film The Dying Swan by director Yevgeni Bauer, for example, {{tells the story}} of an artist who strangles a ballerina. Maya Plisetskaya re-interpreted the swan simply as elderly and stubbornly resisting the effects of aging, much <b>like</b> <b>herself.</b> Eventually the piece came to be considered one of Pavlova's trademarks. More recently, Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo perform a parody version that emphasizes every excess dormant in the choreography, and, in 2000, street theatre artist Judith Lanigan created a hula hoop act based on the Fokine/Pavlova ballet divertissement that has been performed at international street theatre festivals, comedy and burlesque events, and in traditional and contemporary-style circuses.|$|E

25|$|Wendy Rose’s work {{is deeply}} rooted in {{ethnography}} and the living myths of Indian peoples. Noted for verse detailing her search for tribal and personal identity, much of Rose’s poetry examines the experiences of mixed-blood Native Americans estranged from both native and white societies. This stems from her own mixed heritage and search for identity. Rose herself has said, “Everything I write is fundamentally autobiographical, no mater what style or topic.” Yet unlike many current and conventional white poets, her poems go beyond self-analysis to focus on others caught between cultures <b>like</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|E

25|$|The way a DP can bind {{given this}} domain {{depends on the}} kind of that DP that is being bound. Anaphors (reflexives pronouns <b>like</b> <b>herself</b> and reciprocals like each other) must be bound in their domain, meaning they must have a c-commanding {{antecedent}} in their domain. Pronouns (such as she or he) must not be bound in their domain, meaning they cannot have a c-commanding antecedent in their domain. Finally, R-expressions (such as proper names, descriptions, or epithets) must not be bound, meaning they must not have a c-commanding antecedent at all.|$|E
25|$|Esther Stutzman, {{who works}} as a {{receptionist}} in a doctor's office, also experiences a close call with Nazi policies when her friends Richard and Maria Klein, closeted Jews <b>like</b> <b>herself,</b> bring their ailing eight-month-old baby, Paul, in for a checkup. The diagnosis, Tay-Sachs disease, is a disease known to be prevalent among Jews. A subsequent investigation into his family background would spell doom for his parents and any names they might be forced to reveal under torture. Although Esther's husband, Walther, is able to hack into the Reich's computer network and change the Klein's family history, it is the revelation that Reichsführer-SS Lothar Prützmann has a nephew with Tay-Sachs that brings the investigation to a halt.|$|E
25|$|Once {{a devoted}} and bright faerie, she {{questioned}} the King {{as to why}} a faerie <b>like</b> <b>herself</b> was not permitted to visit him as often and freely as Oran. The King responds by saying that she and Oran are different by birth, and faery as lowly as Seraphina can not possibly compare herself with Oran. This left Seraphina jealous and determine to best Oran, {{no matter what it}} took, and constantly strove towards what ever goal Oran was headed to. She tricks Oran into staying on Earth by ordering Goodfellow to lead Sindo to the bathing spring, then altering the barrier that was supposed to hide them from humans so that Oran's gown was exposed for stealing. Seraphina uses the opportunity to achieve her ambitions and become the Queen of Avalon. Unfortunately, she is rejected again and again by the King, who constantly reminds Seraphina that no matter how hard she works, even after she becomes a 1st class faerie, she will never compare to Oran because Seraphina simply tries too hard to be something Oran comes by naturally. When Pain and Fanta arrive in Avalon, Seraphina appears again to eliminate Pain only to find that he is powerful enough to detect her spells with ease. Oreadia eventually masterminds Seraphina's downfall by using Fanta, Pain, and Syndra; Seraphina is punished for her attempt to get rid of Oreadia and reborn as a human on earth who would remember her heavenly origins only when she turned fifteen.|$|E

5000|$|One {{other aspect}} of Jessica's life {{is that there were}} few {{involved}} projects she could do on her own. Despite complaining about being in Elizabeth's shadow, Jessica often relied on her sister to cover for her, pretend to be her, tie up lose ends, run a project itself, or bail her out of a sticky situation. Despite often vowing to make Jessica do things on her own, Elizabeth continually [...] "helped" [...] her sister, which was her weak spot. As a result, Jessica became rather spoiled and dependent. Despite her sister's help, she often manipulated Elizabeth or tried to corrupt Elizabeth's relationship with boys she <b>liked</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|R

500|$|... "God Help the Outcasts" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} {{composer}} Alan Menken and lyricist Stephen Schwartz for Walt Disney Pictures' 34th animated feature film The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996). A pop ballad, the song is performed by American singer Heidi Mollenhauer as the singing voice of Esmeralda on American actress Demi Moore's behalf, who provides the character's speaking voice. A prayer, [...] "God Help the Outcasts" [...] is a somber hymn in which a beset Esmeralda asks God to shield outcasts and Roma <b>like</b> <b>herself</b> against racism and discrimination {{at the hands of}} Paris and Judge Claude Frollo. The song also establishes Esmeralda as a selfless, empathetic character with whom Quasimodo falls in love.|$|E
500|$|Due to the high-pitch {{employed}} in the recording, Dickson reflected in later years that she [...] "never liked the original [...] for that reason.

While performing it later point of time on her concerts, Dickson sang it in her actual tone, saying that although the track [...] "might have been written for a teenage girl, but the experience of being abandoned by a man is one, women of all ages can relate to. I {{think you have to be}} honest with songs and with yourself." [...] The singer's music director Ian Lynn arranged the track differently which she performs currently.|$|E

500|$|Carey Mulligan {{was cast}} as Winnie Gekko, Gordon's estranged {{daughter}} and Jacob's fiancée. Winnie has not {{spoken to her}} father since his imprisonment; she blames Gordon for the suicide of her drugged-out brother, Rudy. The character has been {{said to be the}} [...] "moral center of the story" [...] and described as being liberal, and to some extent passive. Mulligan is British and had to speak with an American accent for her role. Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps was her first major studio film. When she first met Stone for the role she explained that she did not want her character to be a [...] "token girlfriend;" [...] both agreed to work to make sure that would not happen. During the same encounter Stone learned that she had short hair, and he initially discussed having her wear a wig, but Mulligan said she did not feel <b>like</b> <b>herself</b> when wearing the hairpiece. Stone trusted her and made an exception. According to Mulligan, Stone cast her in the Wall Street sequel based on her performance in An Education (2009).|$|E
500|$|Luis {{uses the}} term [...] "onomastic displacement" [...] with {{reference}} to the multiple nicknames that fragment Yolanda's concept of a whole and unified self. This continuous onomastic displacement incites in Yolanda the desire to question her divided identity, to seek unity, clarity and a coherent understanding of her circumstances. Yolanda achieves this clarity through the act of writing and even as a young girl she revels in the completion of her speech for the Teacher's Day address because [...] "she finally sound <b>like</b> <b>herself</b> in English!" [...] Unlike her sister Sandi, [...] "whose artistic predilections were crushed as a child, Yolanda faces and works through her identity problems in her writing". [...] Barak views Yolanda's writing as a process {{that can be used to}} reunite the fragments of her identity; as an aid in the acceptance of [...] "her own 'hybrid' nature... bringing both her worlds and all her selves into balance". It is thus only through writing, the expression of Yolanda's most intricately personal thoughts and revelations, that the protagonist can retain the hope of restoring her unified personal identity.|$|E
500|$|According to scholar Sondra O'Neale, Angelou's poetry can {{be placed}} within the African-American oral tradition, and her prose [...] "follows classic {{technique}} in nonpoetic Western forms". [...] O'Neale states that Angelou avoided using a [...] "monolithic black language", and accomplished, through direct dialogue, what O'Neale calls a [...] "more expected ghetto expressiveness". [...] McWhorter finds both the language Angelou used in her autobiographies and the people she depicted unrealistic, resulting in a separation {{between her and her}} audience. [...] As McWhorter states, [...] "I have never read autobiographical writing where I had such a hard time summoning a sense of how the subject talks, or a sense of who the subject really is". [...] McWhorter asserts, for example, that key figures in Angelou's books, <b>like</b> <b>herself,</b> her son Guy, and mother Vivian do not speak as one would expect, and that their speech is [...] "cleaned up" [...] for her readers. [...] Guy, for example, represents the young black male, while Vivian represents the idealized mother figure, and the stiff language they use, as well as the language in Angelou's text, is intended to prove that blacks can use standard English competently.|$|E
