The surface charge features of important <b>layered</b> <b>silicates</b> including mica, talc, and kaolinite are described from atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements, electrophoresis measurements, and/or results from potentiometric titration. In addition, the wetting characteristics of the silica tetrahedral surface which is common to all <b>layered</b> <b>silicates</b> are examined with different experimental techniques and results are discussed. The wettability of trilayer silicates and bilayer silicates is discussed, particularly the wettability of the silica tetrahedral face and alumina octahedral face of kaolinite based on MDS results as well as recent AFM results.

These <b>layer</b> <b>silicates</b> can be classified into two distinct crystallochemical groups: (1) fine-grained, polycrystalline smectite minerals; and (2) well-ordered, single crystals of kaolinite and Mg-poor talc. The <b>layer</b> <b>silicates</b> in this portion of sample W 7029 (asterisk) A are dissimilar to those described in other chondritic porous aggregates. The predominant <b>layer</b> <b>silicate</b> assemblage in W 7029 (asterisk) A indicates that heating of the aggregate during atmospheric entry was brief and probably to a temperature less than 300 C.

40|$|A {{series of}} TPU nanocomposites were {{prepared}} by incorporating organically modified <b>layered</b> <b>silicates</b> with controlled particle size. To our knowledge, {{this is the}} first study into the effects of layered silicate diameter in polymer nanocomposites utilizing the same mineral for each size fraction. The tensile properties of these materials were found to be highly dependent upon the size of the <b>layered</b> <b>silicates.</b> A decrease in disk diameter was associated with a sharp upturn in the stress-strain curve and a pronounced increase in tensile strength. Results from SAXS/SANS experiments showed that the <b>layered</b> <b>silicates</b> did not affect the bulk TPU microphase structure and the morphological response of the host TPU to deformation or promote/hinder strain-induced soft segment crystallization. The improved tensile properties of the nanocomposites containing the smaller nanofillers resulted from the <b>layered</b> <b>silicates</b> aligning in the direction of strain and interacting with the TPU sequences via secondary bonding. This phenomenon contributes predominantly above 400 % strain once the microdomain architecture has largely been disassembled. Large tactoids that are unable to align in the strain direction lead to concentrated tensile stresses between the polymer and filler, instead of desirable shear stresses, resulting in void formation and reduced tensile properties.

40|$|In this {{research}} work the morphology of polylactic acid (PLA) filled with {{various types of}} <b>layered</b> <b>silicates,</b> {{as well as its}} influence on the rheological properties regarding melt strength and complex viscosity, were investigated. Thereby the morphology of the produced nanocomposites were examined with small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements. For the determination of melt strength a Rheotens apparatus, fed by a bypass system during extrusion, was used. Complex viscosities were measured with a rotational rheometer with cone- plate setup. Results show that the different modifications of the <b>layered</b> <b>silicates</b> {{have a significant impact on}} the final morphology as well as on the rheological properties of the produced nanocomposites. Beside different achieved interlayer distances and grades of intercalation of the <b>layered</b> <b>silicates</b> inside the polymer matrix, also increased melt strength as well as increased complex viscosities were observed. Thereby a homogenous dispersion and high grade of exfoliation is also preferable for the production of thin products like films.

The <b>layered</b> <b>silicates</b> such as sodium bentonite and sodium fluorohectorite were the nanofillers used and the conventional micro fillers were clay and silica. Latex nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray diffraction technique. The dispersion of <b>layered</b> <b>silicates</b> in the polymer matrix was analysed using transmission electron microscopy. The fluorohectorite silicate showed excellent dispersion in natural rubber matrix. The effect of free volume on the gas barrier properties was investigated by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. It was observed that due to the platelet like morphology and high aspect ratio of <b>layered</b> <b>silicates,</b> the gas barrier properties of nano filled latex membranes were very high. The crosslink density values and extent of reinforcement were estimated in order to correlate with the gas barrier properties. The oxygen/nitrogen selectivity of these membranes were investigated.

40|$|The barrier {{properties}} {{and long term}} strength retention of polymers are of significant importance {{in a number of}} applications. Enhanced lifetime food packaging, substrates for OLED based flexible displays and long duration scientific balloons are among them. Higher material requirements in these applications drive the need for an accurate measurement system. Therefore, a new system was engineered with enhanced sensitivity and accuracy. Permeability of polymers is affected by permeant solubility and diffusion. One effort to decrease diffusion rates is via increasing the transport path length. We explore this through dispersion of <b>layered</b> <b>silicates</b> into polymers. <b>Layered</b> <b>silicates</b> with effective aspect ratio of 1000 : 1 have shown promise in improving the barrier and mechanical properties of polymers. The surface of these inorganic silicates was modified with surfactants to improve the interaction with organic polymers. The micro and nanoscale dispersion of the <b>layered</b> <b>silicates</b> was probed using optical and transmission microscopy as well as x-ray diffraction. Thermal transitions were analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry. Mechanical and permeability measurements were correlated to the dispersion and increased density. The essential structure-property relationships were established by comparing semicrystalline and amorphous polymers. Semicrystalline polymers selected were nylon- 6 and polyethylene terephthalate. The amorphous polymer was polyethylene terphthalate-glycol. Densification due to the layered silicate in both semicrystalline and amorphous polymers was associated with significant impact on barrier and long term creep behavior. The inferences were confirmed by investigating a semi-crystalline polymer - polyethylene - above and below the glass transition.

In both cases, the presence of the <b>layered</b> <b>silicate</b> remarkably improved the creep behaviour. The improvement of these properties can be assigned to the stiff fillers and the configurational linkage between the polymer and the <b>layered</b> <b>silicate</b> which are supported by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterisations by showing a distinct change in surface morphology associated with improved impact toughness and creep response...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} an {{organically}} surface modified <b>layered</b> <b>silicate</b> on the viscosity of various epoxy resins of different structures and different functionalities was investigated. Steady and dynamic shear viscosities of the epoxy resins containing 0 - 10 wt% of the organoclay were determined using parallel plate rheology. Viscosity results {{were compared with}} those achieved through addition of a commonly used micron-sized CaCO 3 filler. It was found that changes in viscosities due to the different fillers were of the same order, since the <b>layered</b> <b>silicate</b> was only dispersed on a micron-sized scale in the monomer (prior to reaction), as indicated by X-ray diffraction measurements. Flow activation energies at a low frequency were determined and did not show any significant changes due to the addition of organoclay or CaCO 3. Comparison between dynamic and steady shear experiments showed good agreement for low <b>layered</b> <b>silicate</b> concentrations below 7. 5 wt%, i. e. the Cox-Merz rule can be applied. Deviations from the Cox-Merz rule appeared at and above 10 wt%, although such deviations were only slightly above experimental error. Most resin organoclay blends were well predicted by the Power Law model, only concentrations of 10 wt% and above requiring the Herschel-Buckley (yield stress) model to achieve better fits. Wide-angle X-ray measurements {{have shown that the}} epoxy resin swells the <b>layered</b> <b>silicate</b> with an increase in the interlayer distance of approximately 15 Angstrom, and that the rheology behavior is due to the lateral, micron-size of these swollen tactoids...|$|R
