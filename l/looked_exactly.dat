500|$|Ian Hendry {{stars as}} Dr John Kane, British {{astrophysicist}} {{and head of}} the Phoenix project. Hendry, who had appeared in the television series The Avengers (1961â€“69) and, according to Anderson, [...] "was always drinking", performed the stunt sequence depicting the aftermath of the Dove crash while drunk: [...] "...he was pissed as a newt, and it was {{as much as he could}} do to stagger away. Despite all that, it <b>looked</b> <b>exactly</b> as it was supposed to on-screen!" [...] In the draft script, Kane's first name is Philip, and he has a wife called Susan. In scenes deleted from the completed film, a romance between Kane and Lise Hartman, a EUROSEC official portrayed by Austrian actress Loni von Friedl, is played out at Kane's villa and on a beach in Portugal.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{moved to}} Placer County, California, on September 13 and {{continued}} {{for less than}} a month. The Big Dipper Mine had been closed for ten years, so von Stroheim convinced the Goldwyn Company to lease and renovate it for filming. While first visiting Placer County during pre-production, von Stroheim had met Harold Henderson, a local resident and fan of Norris whose brother had worked in the mine in the 1890s. Von Stroheim hired Henderson to oversee the renovation of the mine and other locations in Iowa Hill. Von Stroheim also wanted to restore the local cemetery for a newly invented scene depicting McTeague's mother's funeral, but the Goldwyn Company turned down this proposal. Inside the mine, von Stroheim usually shot at night between 9pm and 6am. Cinematographer William H. Daniels later said that von Stroheim insisted on descending [...] underground for realism, even though the setting would have <b>looked</b> <b>exactly</b> the same at [...] Filming was completed on October 6, 1923, after 198 days. Despite his original contract stipulating that all films be under , von Stroheim shot a total of [...] of footage for the film, running approximately 85 hours.|$|E

500|$|Michael Pascua of The Huffington Post disliked Stevens' wig, writing: [...] "Izzie's wig looked horrible. She <b>looked</b> <b>exactly</b> {{like her}} mother Robbie and that's not a compliment. I loved Cristina's Stepford wife joke and how everyone, {{including}} Derek, couldn't help but stare at her hair. Yet, no one had the balls to tell her it was bad." [...] Pascua also enjoyed Leigh's performance as Lexie, commenting: [...] "This was one episode I felt that Lexie was a genuine character. She still maintained that book-smart ability to repeat facts (like the merger cases) and shows a command of medical situations." [...] He too found Oh's bear voice comical, adding: [...] "I laughed when Cristina attempted to do her voice for Mr. Bear because you knew that she didn't {{know what she was}} doing." [...] Pascua was shocked with the departure of Utterbacks' character, writing: [...] "I can't believe that they cut Nurse Olivia. I understand that she wasn't really around, but having her as a tertiary character was nice. It was kind of ass-y of the chief not to personally tell these people that they were being cut, but it made Derek look really chivalrous." ...|$|E
500|$|Dick became {{concerned}} {{that no one}} had informed him about the film's production, which added to his distrust of Hollywood. After Dick criticized an early version of Fancher's script in an article written for the Los Angeles Select TV Guide, the studio sent Dick the Peoples rewrite. Although Dick died shortly before the film's release, he was pleased with the rewritten script and with a 20-minute special effects test reel that was screened for him when he was invited to the studio. Despite his well-known skepticism of Hollywood in principle, Dick enthused to Scott that the world created for the film <b>looked</b> <b>exactly</b> as he had imagined it. He said, [...] "I saw a segment of Douglas Trumbull's special effects for Blade Runner on the KNBC-TV news. I recognized it immediately. It was my own interior world. They caught it perfectly." [...] He also approved of the film's script, saying, [...] "After I finished reading the screenplay, I got the novel out and looked through it. The two reinforce each other, so that someone who started with the novel would enjoy the movie and someone who started with the movie would enjoy the novel." [...] The motion picture was dedicated to Dick. Principal photography of Blade Runner began on March 9, 1981, and ended four months later.|$|E
500|$|Krusty's {{appearance}} and design is essentially that of Homer Simpson with clown makeup. Groening said that [...] "The satirical conceit that I {{was going for}} {{at the time was}} that The Simpsons was about a kid who had no respect for his father, but worshipped a clown who <b>looked</b> <b>exactly</b> like his father", a theme which became less important as the show developed. One concept initially saw Krusty being revealed as Homer's secret identity but the idea was dropped for being too complex and because the writers were too busy developing the series. There are two instances of the one assuming the identity of the other. In a (non-canonical) Butterfinger commercial, pertaining to a contest for $50,000 to find out who stole Bart's Butterfinger, a captured Homer appears to be the culprit until Maggie pulls off a mask, revealing Krusty. [...] In the episode [...] "Homie the Clown", Homer goes to Clown College and dresses up as and is confused with Krusty. Krusty was originally just a normal man wearing clown makeup, but David Silverman noted that [...] "at some point, we decided he looked [...] all the time." [...] The producers had long discussions about whether or not Krusty would always remain in his clown makeup but eventually decided that it did not matter. The writers had tried showing Krusty's real face a few times in early episodes, but decided that it did not look right, although his real face was seen in [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] and [...] "Like Father, Like Clown". Later episodes made jokes about Krusty's face. In [...] "Homer's Triple Bypass", Krusty reveals that his [...] "grotesque appearance" [...] is the result of multiple heart attacks. Homer remarks that he seems fine, and Krusty replies, [...] "This ain't makeup." [...] In [...] "Bart the Fink", [...] he abandons an idea to sail away with a new identity and swims towards shore, leaving a trail of yellow makeup in his wake and his natural white face underneath. On shore, he shakes off his black hair, revealing his natural green clown hair, and removes his normal-looking fake nose to reveal his natural red bulbous clown nose underneath.|$|E

2500|$|In 2007, Schillaci's {{activities}} under alias Dylan Thomas {{caught the}} attention of volunteers on Wikisposure, now , a project of Perverted-Justice, which builds databases on pedophilia activists. who began to investigate and monitor [...] "Thomas'" [...] activities on the Internet. Members of Wikisposure found a profile Thomas had posted on his website in 2003. In it, he discussed playing the piano to attract children's interest. A path of similar profiles was discovered across the Internet. Each profile had a different username or alias but listed something in common. Profile of Christopher D. Ahrens was discovered on an engineering website had a small photograph attached to it. A person in the photograph <b>looked</b> <b>exactly</b> like Jon Schillaci. Evidence indicated that online profiles of Dylan Thomas, Christopher Ahrens, among others, were all created by Schillaci. After Wikisposure gave the information to the FBI, authorities were able to track down the location of the computer being used by Schillaci. The FBI wouldn't comment on Wikisposure's role, citing its policy of not commenting on who provides information.|$|E
