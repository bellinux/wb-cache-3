These radio losses were {{calculated}} through simulations {{for a range}} of data rates. These simulations included both suppressed carrier modulation and residual carrier modulation cases. The radio losses were calculated for a frame error rate of 3 x 10 ^- 4 for (8920, 1 / 3) and (8920, 1 / 6) codes and 3 frame error rate of 6 x 10 ^- 5 for (1764, 1 / 3) and (1784, 1 / 6) codes. The simulations for the residual carrier case were run for <b>loop</b> <b>signal</b> to noise ratios of 13 dB, 15 dB and 17 dB with a loop bandwidth of 10 Hz. The simulations for the suppressed carrier case were run for a <b>loop</b> of <b>signal</b> to noise ratio of 17 dB. The results of these simulations indicate that the radio losses for turbo codes are low enough to warrant their use in deep space links (maximum of 1 dB loss at 17 dB <b>loop</b> <b>signal</b> to noise ratio for residual carrier and 1. 3 dB loss at 17 dB <b>loop</b> <b>signal</b> to noise ratio for suppressed carrier at high data rates). Furthermore, these results indicate that by normalizing the radio losses for frame size, loop bandwidth and the <b>loop</b> <b>signal</b> to noise ratio, a single curve could be used for calculating the radio loss for any given data rate at any given <b>loop</b> <b>signal</b> to noise ratio...|$|R

50|$|This {{deficit in}} {{activation}} also {{results in a}} decrease in activity of 5-HT1A receptors in the raphe nucleus.(Bantick, Deakin, Grasby 2001) This serves to increase global serotonin levels, as 5-HT1A serves as an autoreceptor. The 5-HT1B receptor, also acting as an autoreceptor, specifically within the striatum, but also parts of basal ganglia then will inhibit serotonin release. This disinhibits frontal dopamine release. The local deficit of 5-HT within the striatum, basal ganglia, and prefrontal cortex causes a deficit of excitatory 5-HT6 signalling. This receptor is primarily GABAergic, as such, it causes an excess of glutamatergic, noradrenergic, dopaminergic, and cholinergic activity within the prefrontal cortex and the striatum. An excess of 5-HT7 signaling within the thalamus also creates too much excitatory transmission to the prefrontal cortex. Combined with another critical abnormality observed in schizoid patients: 5-HT2A dysfunction, this altered signalling cascade creates cortical, thus cognitive abnormalities. 5-HT2A allows a link between cortical, thus conscious, and the basal ganglia, unconscious. Axons from 5-HT2A neurons in layer V of the cerebral cortex reach the basal ganglia, forming a feedback <b>loop.</b> <b>Signalling</b> from layer V of the cerebral cortex to the basal ganglia alters 5-HT2C signalling. This feedback loop with 5-HT2A/5-HT2C is how the outer cortex layers can exert some control over our neuropeptides, specifically opioid peptides, oxytocin and vasopressin. This alteration in this limbic-layer V axis may create the profound change in social cognition (and sometimes cognition as a whole) that is observed in schizoid patients. However, genesis of the actual alterations {{is a much more}} complex phenomena.|$|E
40|$|A phase {{relationship}} is identified between sequential edge localized modes (ELMs) occurrence {{times in a}} set of H-mode tokamak plasmas to the voltage measured in full flux azimuthal loops in the divertor region. We focus on plasmas in the Joint European Torus where a steady H-mode is sustained over several seconds, during which ELMs are observed in the Be II emission at the divertor. The ELMs analysed arise from intrinsic ELMing, in that there is no deliberate intent to control the ELMing process by external means. We use ELM timings derived from the Be II signal to perform direct time domain analysis of the full flux loop VLD 2 and VLD 3 signals, which provide a high cadence global measurement proportional to the voltage induced by changes in poloidal magnetic flux. Specifically, we examine how the time interval between pairs of successive ELMs is linked to the time-evolving phase of the full flux <b>loop</b> <b>signals.</b> Each ELM produces a clear early pulse in the full flux <b>loop</b> <b>signals,</b> whose peak time is used to condition our analysis. The arrival time of the following ELM, relative to this pulse, is found to fall into one of two categories: (i) prompt ELMs, which are directly paced by the initial response seen in the flux loop signals; and (ii) all other ELMs, which occur after the initial response of the full flux <b>loop</b> <b>signals</b> has decayed in amplitude. The times at which ELMs in category (ii) occur, relative to the first ELM of the pair, are clustered at times when the instantaneous phase of the full flux <b>loop</b> <b>signal</b> is close to its value {{at the time of the}} first ELM...|$|R

40|$|In modern music genres like Pop, Rap, Hip-Hop or Techno many {{songs are}} {{built in a}} way that a pool of small musical pieces, so called loops, are used as {{building}} blocks. These loops are usually one, two or four bars long and build the accompaniment for the lead melody or singing voice. Very often the accompanying loops can be heard solo in a song at least once. This can be used as a-priori knowledge for removing these loops from the mixture.

40|$|A global {{signature}} of the build-up to an intrinsic edge localized mode (ELM) {{is found in the}} temporal analytic phase of signals measured in full flux azimuthal loops in the divertor region of JET. Toroidally integrating, full flux <b>loop</b> <b>signals</b> provide a global measurement proportional to the voltage induced by changes in poloidal magnetic flux; they are electromagnetically induced by the dynamics of spatially integrated current density. We perform direct time-domain analysis of the high time-resolution full flux <b>loop</b> <b>signals</b> VLD 2 and VLD 3. We analyze plasmas where a steady H-mode is sustained over several seconds during which all the observed ELMs are intrinsic; there is no deliberate intent to pace the ELMing process by external means. ELM occurrence times are determined from the Be II emission at the divertor. We previously [Chapman et al., Phys. Plasmas 21, 062302 (2014); Chapman et al., in 41 st EPS Conference on Plasma Physics, Europhysics Conference Abstracts (European Physical Society, 2014), Vol. 38 F, ISBN 2 - 914771 - 90 - 8] found that the occurrence times of intrinsic ELMs correlate with specific temporal analytic phases of the VLD 2 and VLD 3 signals. Here, we investigate how the VLD 2 and VLD 3 temporal analytic phases vary with time in advance of the ELM occurrence time. We identify a build-up to the ELM in which the VLD 2 and VLD 3 signals progressively align to the temporal analytic phase at which ELMs preferentially occur, on a ∼ 2 − 5 ms timescale. At the same time, the VLD 2 and VLD 3 signals become temporally phase synchronized with each other, consistent with the emergence of coherent global dynamics in the integrated current density. In a plasma that remains close to a global magnetic equilibrium, this can reflect bulk displacement or motion of the plasma. This build-up signature to an intrinsic ELM can be extracted from a time interval of data that does not extend beyond the ELM occurrence time, so that these full flux <b>loop</b> <b>signals</b> could assist in ELM prediction or mitigation...|$|R
