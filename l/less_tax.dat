25|$|Although artisanal logging {{provides}} some {{income for the}} community in the short-run, it ultimately does not improve local living conditions. In the end, the communities receive payments which are not large {{enough to cover the}} loss of their natural resources. Since there is no monitoring mechanism, the loggers report lower harvested amounts than they actually do in order to pay <b>less</b> <b>tax</b> to the local government. Some loggers cut one tree within the woods and leave the rest intact to mimic natural disturbance. To improve the situation, the DRC government needs better monitoring and better forest code to manage the logging activities.|$|E
500|$|Small-scale farmers also {{protested that}} Hamilton's excise {{effectively}} gave unfair {{tax breaks to}} large distillers, {{most of whom were}} based in the east. There were two methods of paying the whiskey excise: paying a flat fee or paying by the gallon. Large distillers produced whiskey in volume and could afford the flat fee. The more efficient they became, the <b>less</b> <b>tax</b> per gallon they would pay (as low as 6cents, according to Hamilton). Western farmers who owned small stills did not usually operate them year-round at full capacity, so they ended up paying a higher tax per gallon (9cents), which made them less competitive. The regressive nature of the tax was further compounded by an additional factor: whiskey sold for considerably less on the cash-poor Western frontier than in the wealthier and more populous East. This meant that, even if all distillers had been required to pay the same amount of tax per gallon, the small-scale frontier distillers would still have to remit a considerably larger proportion of their product's value than larger Eastern distillers. Small-scale distillers believed that Hamilton deliberately designed the tax to ruin them and promote big business, a view endorsed by some historians. However, historian Thomas Slaughter argued that a [...] "conspiracy of this sort is difficult to document". Whether by design or not, large distillers recognized the advantage that the excise gave them and they supported it.|$|E

Governments of the poorer sample raise <b>less</b> <b>taxes</b> in the short run but more in the long run and spend more money on education when remittances come in; in the richer sample they raise <b>less</b> <b>taxes</b> and spend <b>less</b> on education in response to remittances but this is almost completely compensated by the positive response of expenditure on education to higher savings, which results from remittances as well. ...|$|R

2500|$|... the Government {{disclosed}} {{its full}} fiscal situation; {{it showed that}} it expected to take $3.1 billion <b>less</b> <b>tax</b> in 2009, forcing the government to borrow $5.9 billion in 2009, rising to $7.3 billion by 2013. This implied higher costs for KiwiSaver, Working For Families and the 20 hours subsidised early-childhood plan; and higher numbers of people forced onto benefits by any prospective economic downturn. Over the next fiscal year, Dr Cullen expected GDP to rise by just 0.1%, with median house prices dropping by an estimated 10–15%.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, tens of {{thousands}} of Asda workers across the UK were hit with a tax complication because of an anomaly in Asda's payroll system. Asda employees receive their pay every four weeks, which means that once every 20 years they are paid 14 times a year rather than 13. [...] Whilst most companies handle this properly, Asda's payroll system did not, which meant that workers had, through no fault of their own, paid <b>less</b> <b>tax</b> for the year than they should have. This resulted in most full-time and a small number of part-time workers receiving a demand from HM Revenue & Customs for between £72 to £160.|$|E
2500|$|Illicit {{capital flight}} from the {{developing}} world is estimated at ten {{times the size of}} aid it receives and twice the debt service it pays, with one estimate that most of Africa would be developed if the taxes owed were paid. About 60 per cent of illicit capital flight from Africa is from transfer mispricing, where a subsidiary in a developing nation sells to another subsidiary or shell company in a tax haven at an artificially low price to pay <b>less</b> <b>tax.</b> An African Union report estimates that about 30% of sub-Saharan Africa's GDP has been moved to tax havens. Solutions include corporate [...] "country-by-country reporting" [...] where corporations disclose activities in each country and thereby prohibit the use of tax havens where no effective economic activity occurs.|$|E
