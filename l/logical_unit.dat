25|$|Flash drives {{implement}} the USB mass storage device class so that most modern operating systems can {{read and write}} to them without installing device drivers. The flash drives present a simple block-structured <b>logical</b> <b>unit</b> to the host operating system, hiding the individual complex implementation details of the various underlying flash memory devices. The operating system can use any file system or block addressing scheme. Some computers can boot up from flash drives.|$|E
25|$|Hyper-V {{implements}} {{isolation of}} virtual machines {{in terms of}} a partition. A partition is a <b>logical</b> <b>unit</b> of isolation, supported by the hypervisor, in which each guest operating system executes. A hypervisor instance has to have at least one parent partition, running a supported version of Windows Server (2008 and later). The virtualization stack runs in the parent partition and has direct access to the hardware devices. The parent partition then creates the child partitions which host the guest OSs. A parent partition creates child partitions using the hypercall API, which is the application programming interface exposed by Hyper-V.|$|E
25|$|Some Portuguese {{family names}} {{are made of}} two words, most often not hyphenated, but are not {{composite}} names, as {{they were not the}} result of combining two family names in past generations; instead, the words constitute a single <b>logical</b> <b>unit.</b> These include toponyms (e.g. Castelo Branco), religious references (e.g. Espírito Santo, Santa Rita), or other expressions (e.g. Corte Real, Mil-Homens). In this case both words must be cited (e.g. writer Camilo Castelo Branco is never referred to as Camilo Branco, and in an alphabetical order list goes under 'C'), and they count as a single unit in what relates to the legal limit of four surnames.|$|E

50|$|Gendlin {{points out}} that the {{universe}} (and everything in it) is implicitly more intricate than concepts, because a) it includes them, and b) all concepts and <b>logical</b> <b>units</b> are generated in a wider, more than conceptual process (which Gendlin calls implicit intricacy). This wider process is more than logical, in a way that has a number of characteristic regularities. Gendlin has shown {{that it is possible to}} refer directly to this process in the context of a given problem or situation and systematically generate new concepts and more precise <b>logical</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R

Recent investigations revealed that bridging faults can be a major failure mode in IC's. Effects of bridging faults in BiCMOS circuits are presented. Bridging faults between <b>logical</b> <b>units</b> without feedback and <b>logical</b> <b>units</b> with feedback are considered. Several bridging faults can be detected by monitoring the power supply current (I(sub DDQ) monitoring). Effects of bridging faults and bridging resistance on output logic levels were examined along with their effects on noise immunity...|$|R

A parameterised problem is in the class Wi, if every instance [...] can be transformed (in fpt-time) to a combinatorial circuit that has weft at most i, such that [...] if and only if there is a satisfying assignment to the inputs, which assigns 1 to at most k inputs. The height thereby is the largest number of <b>logical</b> <b>units</b> with unbounded fan-in on any path from an input to the output. The number of <b>logical</b> <b>units</b> with bounded fan-in on the paths must be limited by a constant that holds for all instances of the problem.|$|R
50|$|LUN vs. SCSI Device ID: The LUN is not {{the only}} way to {{identify}} a <b>logical</b> <b>unit.</b> There is also the SCSI Device ID, which identifies a <b>logical</b> <b>unit</b> uniquely in the world. Labels or serial numbers stored in a logical unit's storage volume often serve to identify the <b>logical</b> <b>unit.</b> However, the LUN is the only way for an initiator to address a command to a particular <b>logical</b> <b>unit,</b> so initiators often create, via a discovery process, a mapping table of LUN to other identifiers.|$|E
50|$|Similar to 08h Busy status, this {{status code}} is {{returned}} when the <b>logical</b> <b>unit</b> lacks {{the resources to}} accept a received task from an I_T nexus. This status code implies that the <b>logical</b> <b>unit</b> already {{has at least one}} task from that I_T nexus, where the 08h Busy status code implies that the <b>logical</b> <b>unit</b> currently has no tasks from that I_T nexus.|$|E
