60|$|Both {{now turned}} their eyes again to leeward, the first direct {{rays of the}} sun {{beginning}} to illumine the surface of the ocean in that quarter. Something like a misty cloud had been settled on the water, rather less than a league from the ship, in the western board, and had hitherto prevented a close examination {{in that part of the}} horizon. The power of the sun, however, almost instantly dispersed it, and then, for the first time, Bob fancied he did discover something like <b>land.</b> <b>Mark,</b> however, could not make it out, until he had gone up into the cross-trees, when he, too, got a glimpse of what, under all the circumstances, he did not doubt was either a portion of the reef that rose above the water, or was what might be termed a low, straggling island. Its distance from the ship, they estimated at rather more than two leagues.|$|E

60|$|After we had sailed {{with them}} some days, we sent them five barrels of beef, one of pork, two hogsheads of biscuit, with peas, flour, and other things; taking three casks of sugar, some rum, and some pieces of eight as payment, we left them, but took the youth and maid with us, {{with all their}} goods. The lad was about {{seventeen}} years old, very handsome, modest, sensible, and well-bred, but mightily concerned {{for the loss of}} his honoured mother, having lost his father at Barbadoes but a few months before. He beseeched the surgeon to intercede with me to take him out of the ship; for that the sailors, not sparing a small sustenance, had starved his mother. But hunger has no bounds, no right, and consequently is incapable of any compassion. When the surgeon told him, our voyage might put him in bad circumstances, and farther from his friends, {{he said he did not}} care, if he was delivered from that terrible crew; that as the Captain (meaning me) had saved him from death, so he was sure he would do him no harm; and, as for the maid, when she was restored to her senses, she would be no less thankful, let us carry them where we would. And indeed the surgeon so represented their case to me, that I consented, and took them on board with all their goods, except eleven hogsheads of sugar; but the youth having a bill of lading, I made the commander oblige himself to deliver a letter and the deceased widow's goods to Mr. Rogers, a merchant in Bristol; but I believe the ship was lost at sea, for we never could hear what became of her afterwards. We were now in the latitude 19 deg. 32 min. having as yet a tolerable good voyage. But, passing by several little incidents relating to wind and weather, I shall relate what is most remarkable concerning my little kingdom, to which I was then drawing near. I had great difficulty in finding it, for as I came to, and went from it before, on the south and east side of the island, as coming from the Brazils, so now approaching between the main and the island, not having any chart for the coast, nor <b>land</b> <b>mark,</b> it obliged us to go on shore on several islands in the mouth of the river Oroonoko, but to the purpose. Thus I perceived, that what I thought was a continent before, was no such thing, but a long island, or rather a ridge of sands. On one of these islands I found some Spaniards, but they belonged to the isle of Trinidad, who came hither in a sloop to make salt, and try to find some pearl muscles. But at length I came fair on the south side of my island, and there I presently knew the countenance of my little kingdom; so we brought the ship safe to an anchor, broadside within the creek, where stood my ancient and venerable castle.|$|E

50|$|Starting in 1999, <b>Land</b> <b>Mark</b> is {{a series}} of {{projects}} that encompasses film, video, photography and performance pieces related to the Puerto Rican island of Vieques, which, for 60 years, was used by the United States for military operations, leading to a civil disobedience campaign waged by local residents. The works include <b>Land</b> <b>Mark</b> (1999/2003/2006), <b>Land</b> <b>Mark</b> (Footprints) (2001-02), Returning a Sound (2004), Under Discussion (2005) and Half Mast\Full Mast (2010). Allora & Calzadilla interrogate the economic, cultural, and political markers that differentiate one area of land from another, and the processes of colonization and gentrification that come to define its changing status. As a whole, these works connected performances typical of political activism to artistic traditions like engraving. <b>Land</b> <b>Mark</b> is explained semantically as an instrument for reading marks left on the territory (landmarks) instead of as a simple point of spatial orientation (landmark). The spatial investigations in Allora & Calzadilla's work are made {{in terms of what the}} artists call “the trace.” At once a poetic trope and a set of material operations, the trace links presence and absence, inscription and erasure, preservation and destruction, and appearance and disappearance.|$|E
