Germanium devices are temperature sensitive, and the effect responds to the incoming signal's amplitude (volume) consistently.

[...] The model was re-designated as the FZ-1a, keeping the same wedge shaped enclosure as the FZ-1. [...] In 1968, an updated model with a different look and sound was introduced, with a circuit designed by Robert Moog using a 9 volt power supply and alternatively 2 or 4 silicon transistors, and labelled the Maestro FZ-1B. It went through 3 circuit revisions. [...] In the 1970s Maestro came out with the The FZ-1S Super-Fuzz, which had a distinctly different look and sound than previous models.|$|E

5000|$|Carpenter {{bees are}} notorious for {{damaging}} man-made “wooden structures, <b>lead</b> <b>cables,</b> fiberglass insulation, and Styrofoam”. Despite their large size and widespread distribution they do not cause severe damage because of their slow development, reuse of nests, and preference of species to develop in trees rather than in structural timber. The carpenter bees are essential due to their pollination ability of various species of flowers. Their large body size makes them the natural pollinators of large flowers such as Passiflora and Luffa species and of other fruits and vegetables. In a Brazilian study, a single carpenter bee pollinated as many Passiflora flowers as an entire colony of honey bees. A major reason {{for the failure of}} attempted Xylocopa utilization in pollination has probably been that no food sources were available to the bees once the crop to be pollinated was no longer in bloom. [...] However, the large carpenter bees have the potential to become an important aid in agricultural systems, especially where honey bees are not as effective. Before agricultural benefits can be gained from carpenter bees the management of semi wild populations must first be achieved.|$|R

Hence, partial discharge needs to be detected and identified before it leads to supply interruptions due to cable insulation failure. In this work, PD diagnostic was carried out using the oscillating wave test system (OWTS). The measurement results together with the cable history data were then used to determine an index known as the severity index which can correctly characterise the cable health. Tests were carried out on 20 underground cables in the Temerloh region.

40|$|Self-equalizing cables using hollow {{conductors}} with {{wall thickness}} {{less than the}} skin depth were proposed in 1929. However, they do not appear ever to have been widely used, although the idea has resurfaced and been refined from time to time. In the early 2000 ’s, self-equalizing conductors consisting of solid magnetic steel cores coated with silver were developed by W. L. Gore, and used in their 2. 5 Gb/s “Eye-Opener” cables, although higher speed versions never appeared. We have revived the original 1929 idea, proposing to use glass as a solid insulating core. This technology can potentially work at frequencies of many 10 ’s of GHz. Possible uses include short range GHz links such as USB and Thunderbolt, and intra-rack interconnections in data centers. Our feasibility experiments have validated the principle. Copper coated glass fibers can, in principle, be manufactured, but in these tests, the conductors were capillaries internally coated with silver as these are easily obtainable, relatively inexpensive and serve to test the concept. The performance of these experimental twin <b>lead</b> <b>cables</b> corresponds to calculations, confirming the general principle. By calculation, we have compared the performance of cables made from copper-on-insulator conductors to that of similar cables made with solid copper conductors, and verified that copper-on-insulator cables have significantly less frequency dependent loss.
