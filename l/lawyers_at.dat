5|$|The Court's {{right to}} give damages was reiterated in Phelps v Prothero in 1855, where the Court of Appeal in Chancery held {{that if a}} {{plaintiff}} starts an action {{in a court of}} equity for specific performance and damages are also appropriate, the court of equity may choose to award damages. This authorisation was limited to certain circumstances, and was again not regularly used. Eventually, the Chancery Amendment Act 1858 gave the Court full jurisdiction to award damages; the situation before that was so limited that <b>lawyers</b> <b>at</b> the time commented as if the Court had not previously been able to do so.|$|E
5|$|Green {{worked as}} a solo {{practitioner}} until March 1952, when he entered into a partnership with Harvey Schmidt. The firm was known as Schmidt and Green until 1954, when Doris M. Harris and A. Leon Higginbotham joined as partners. In 1955 J. Austin Norris, a prominent African-American political figure, joined the firm, which was then known as Norris, Schmidt, Green, Harris, & Higginbotham. The firm was the first African-American law firm in Philadelphia. The firm, which never numbered {{more than a dozen}} <b>lawyers</b> <b>at</b> a given time, produced four federal judges; Higginbotham, Green, and Herbert Hutton all served on the District Court (Higginbotham was later elevated to the Third Circuit), and William Hall was the first African American appointed as a federal magistrate judge. In addition, two members of the firm, Dorris Harris and Harvey Schmidt, were elected judges of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, and William Brown was appointed by President Nixon to be chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.|$|E

25|$|Tribunals operate formal {{processes}} to adjudicate disputes {{in a similar}} way to courts of law, but have different rules and procedures; and only operate in a specialised area. In theory, their procedures may be better suited for particular types of disputes, cheaper to administer and require less-qualified officials. In the case of appeals, however, disputes will enter the conventional court system, possibly reaching the Court of Appeal and UK Supreme Court, so the judiciary still have oversight over the tribunals. Parties are sometimes represented by <b>lawyers</b> <b>at</b> tribunals.|$|E

25|$|Barbara and Mary Ellen {{attempted}} suicide in prison {{during the two}} years before their trial. Sobhraj, however, had entered with precious gems concealed in his body and was experienced in bribing captors and living comfortably in jail. Sobhraj turned his trial into a show, hiring and firing <b>lawyers</b> <b>at</b> whim, bringing in his recently paroled brother André to assist, and eventually going on a hunger strike. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison instead of the expected death penalty.

Livingstone, with assistance from <b>lawyers</b> <b>at</b> the firm Ralston, Siddons and Richardson. A year later the National Capital Area Council was formed. The oldest unit in the council is Troop 52, chartered to All Saints Episcopal Church in Chevy Chase. This unit dates back to 1913. When the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia decided that the security of suffrage marchers in 1916 was not their problem, the youth of Troop 52 took up that duty. Starting in 1996 the council annually sponsored the Commodore Henry I. Nygard Regatta along with the Friends of Sea Scouts of Maryland.|$|E
25|$|In December 1932, {{the general}} counsel of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) resigned, and Reed was {{appointed}} the agency's new general counsel. Since 1930, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Eugene Meyer, had pressed Hoover to take a more active approach to ameliorating the Great Depression. Hoover finally relented and submitted legislation. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation Act was signed into law on January 22, 1932, but its operations were kept secret for five months. Hoover feared both political attacks from Republicans and that publicity about which corporations were receiving RFC assistance might disrupt the agency's attempts to keep companies financially viable. When Congress passed legislation in July 1932 forcing the RFC to make public the companies that received loans, the resulting political embarrassment led to the resignation of the RFC's president and his successor as well as other staff turnover at the agency. Franklin D. Roosevelt's election as President in November 1932 led to further staff changes. On December 1, 1932, the RFC's general counsel resigned, and Hoover appointed Reed to the position. Roosevelt, impressed with Reed's work and needing someone who knew the agency, its staff and its operations, kept Reed on. Reed mentored and protected the careers of a number of young <b>lawyers</b> <b>at</b> RFC, many of whom became highly influential in the Roosevelt administration: Alger Hiss, Robert H. Jackson, Thomas Gardiner Corcoran, Charles Edward Wyzanski, Jr. (later an important federal district court judge), and David Cushman Coyle.|$|E

500|$|Sleep {{were ready}} to record the album in 1995 but did not record it until 1996 as the band was still {{contracted}} with Earache.

They chose to sign to London, as they were promised complete artistic freedom and more money, and since the label did not have any metal bands, Sleep felt they would receive special treatment. The members of Sleep were poor, and used the majority of money they received from London Records to cover for the debt they were in at that time.|$|E
500|$|On {{its release}} most critics {{agreed that the}} book was both scandalous and career-ending. [...] (Even with {{a quarter of the}} 1,000-page {{original}} manuscript excised, it took <b>lawyers</b> <b>at</b> Random House fourteen months to approve it for publication.) Lewis Cole, in The Nation, described it as being [...] " [...] written but spat out, a breakneck, formless performance piece...propelled by spite and vanity". Newsweek's review called it a [...] "573-page primal scream", while one Hollywood producer said it was [...] "the longest suicide note in history". In the 2003 documentary version of Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, based on Peter Biskind's 1998 anecdotal history of New Hollywood, Richard Dreyfuss recalled his initial fury at Phillips' revelations, before more circumspectly listening to [...] "a little voice inside my head [...] 'Richard, Richard, the truth was so much worse'." [...] Despite Phillips' criticisms of Steven Spielberg in the book, Spielberg nevertheless invited her to a 1997 screening of Close Encounters of the Third Kind as a way of [...] "keeping his friends close and his enemies closer."

500|$|Evans {{gradually}} {{withdrew from}} the operations of his workshops, with his son George managing operations in Pittsburgh and his sons-in-law James Rush and John Muhlenberg likewise in Philadelphia. The Mars Works was by now an established entity, receiving prestigious commissions such as the engines for the Philadelphia Mint in 1816. Records indicate the Mars Works would turn out {{more than one hundred}} steam engines by the time of Evans death. In retirement Evans became increasingly consumed with pursuing his patent dues from those using his technology, which was now widespread. In 1817 he stated that his time was [...] "wholly engrossed by law suits". Evans had become somewhat obsessed and took on a siege mentality, penning to his numerous <b>lawyers</b> (<b>at</b> its height he had fifteen working on his various cases across the United States) his final work, known as Oliver Evans to His Counsel: Who are Engaged in Defence of His Patent Rights, for the Improvements He Has Invented: Containing a Short Account of Two Out of Eighty of His Inventions, Their Rise and Progress in Despite of All Opposition and Difficulties, and Two of His Patents with Explanations. Evans undertook travel to distant areas of the country in order to find offenders. On a trip to Vermont, Evans visited various mills and then promptly engaged a lawyer there to press charges against twenty-two of them for perceived breaches of his patent rights.|$|E

500|$|The Litigators {{is said to}} be [...] "an amusing and appalling {{look into}} the machinations of a {{nationwide}} class-action suit," [...] according to Tobin Harshaw of Bloomberg L.P. [...] The Wall Street Journals Christopher John Farley noted that the book is lighter than Grisham's other works. Publishers Weekly called it a [...] "bitingly farcical look at <b>lawyers</b> <b>at</b> the bottom of the food chain". CNN described the book as an original perspective of [...] "the best and worst the American system of justice has to offer". Louis Bayard of The Washington Post, who described himself as someone who abandoned Grisham after his first three novels, noted that this book might be a good starting point for those who have tired of Grisham. [...] Andrea Simakis of The Plain Dealer describes the book as a [...] "heartier meal" [...] than Grisham's usual [...] "potato-chip fiction". Publishers Weekly also notes that the fairy tale ending is not really in keeping with the introduction's dark humor. Rick Arthur of The United Arab Emirates publication The National describes the book unfavorably as a cross between prior Grisham works The Street Lawyer and The King of Torts and similarly describes the protagonist unfavorably to those of The Firm and The Rainmaker. Geoffrey Wansell of the Daily Mail presented one of the more favorable reviews describing the book as [...] "a spectacular return to form, displaying the clarity and passion that were there in his first thrillers but seemed to ebb away." [...] Wansell notes that Grisham returned to one of his seminal themes of the idealistic young lawyer fighting with the realization that corporations only care about maximizing profits.|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} {{raises questions}} about the range to which copyright law can extend. Alex Chapman of Campbell Hooper solicitors, stated [...] "The Church will have an uphill battle in a legal claim against Sony, and indeed it is likely that there is no basis for a claim." [...] He cited a provision in the UK's 1988 Copyright Designs and Patents act that [...] "explicitly states that it is not copyright infringement to represent certain artistic works that are on public display". This includes sculptures and buildings which are [...] "permanently situated in a public place or in premises open to the public". Chapman also pointed out that, in the UK, copyright expires 70 years after the person who created the work dies. He went on to say, [...] "What all this means is that public buildings are generally fair game for inclusion in video games, films et cetera, and it is something that their owners just have to accept. What isn't fair game, however, is if the building is presented in a way that could be said to be defamatory in relation to those associated with it and this might be what the Church is more concerned about. Also if the representation of the building could be argued to have become so closely associated with a business that its representation amounts to a false endorsement of Sony or its products, or it is registered as a trademark, there may be issues. In each case however my impression is that the Church will have some difficulty in pursuing Sony. There is no law against insensitivity and as with many matters of this kind, it is the public reaction that might be more damaging than the legal one." [...] An unofficial review, by <b>lawyers</b> <b>at</b> Freeth Cartwright, of the rights that Sony might have infringed concluded that the Church of England did not have a case on either copyright or passing off grounds.|$|E
