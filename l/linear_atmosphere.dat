40|$|Dry summers {{over the}} eastern Mediterranean are {{characterized}} by strong descent anchored by long Rossby waves, which are forced by diabatic heating associated with summer monsoon rainfall over South Asia. The large-scale teleconnection between rising and subsiding air masses {{is referred to as}} the "monsoon-desert mechanism. '' This study evaluates the ability of the phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP 5) models in representing the physical processes involved in this mechanism. An evaluation of statistics between summer climatologies of monsoon diabatic heating and that of vertical velocity over the eastern Mediterranean suggests a linear relationship. Despite large spatial diversity in monsoon heating, descent over the Mediterranean is coherently located and realistic in intensity. To measure the sensitivity of descent to the diversity in the horizontal and vertical distribution of monsoon heating, a series of <b>linear</b> <b>atmosphere</b> model experiments are performed. It is shown that column-integrated heating over both the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea provides the largest descent with a more realistic spatial pattern. In the vertical, CMIP 5 models underestimate the diabatic heating at upper levels, while they overestimate it at lower levels, resulting in a weaker forced response and weaker associated descent over the Mediterranean. A moist static energy budget analysis applied to CMIP 5 suggests that most models capture the dominant role of horizontal temperature advection and radiative fluxes in balancing descent over the Mediterranean. Based on the objective analysis herein, a subset of models is identified that captures the teleconnection for reasons consistent with observations. The recognized processes vary at interannual time scales as well, with imprints of severe weak/strong monsoons noticeable over the Mediterranean...|$|E
40|$|Diagnostics {{performed}} with twentieth-century (1861 - 2000) ensemble integrations of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Climate Model, version 2. 1 (CM 2. 1) suggest that, during the developing phase, El Nino events that co-occur with the Indian Ocean Dipole Zonal Mode (IODZM; class 1) {{are stronger than}} those without (class 2). Also, during class 1 events coherent sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies develop in the Indonesian seas that closely follow {{the life cycle of}} IODZM. This study investigates the effect of these regional SST anomalies (equatorial Indian Ocean and Indonesian seas) on the amplitude of the developing El Nino. An examination of class 1 minus class 2 composites suggests two conditions {{that could lead to a}} strong El Nino in class 1 events: (i) during January, ocean-atmosphere conditions internal to the equatorial Pacific are favorable for the development of a stronger El Nino and (ii) during May-June, coinciding with the development of regional SST anomalies, an abrupt increase in westerly wind anomalies is noticeable over the equatorial western Pacific with a subsequent increase in thermocline and SST anomalies over the eastern equatorial Pacific. This paper posits the hypothesis that, under favorable conditions in the equatorial Pacific, regional SST anomalies may enable the development of a stronger El Nino. Owing to a wealth of feedbacks in CM 2. 1, solutions from a <b>linear</b> <b>atmosphere</b> model forced with May-June anomalous precipitation and anomalous SST from selected areas over the equatorial Indo-Pacific are examined. Consistent with our earlier study, the net Kelvin wave response to contrasting tropical Indian Ocean heating anomalies cancels over the equatorial western Pacific. In contrast, Indonesian seas SST anomalies account for about 60 %- 80 % of the westerly wind anomalies over the equatorial western Pacific and also induce anomalous precipitation over the equatorial central Pacific. It is argued that the feedback between the precipitation and circulation anomalies results in an abrupt increase in zonal wind anomalies over the equatorial western Pacific. Encouraged by these results, the authors further examined the processes that cause cold SST anomalies over the Indonesian seas using an ocean model. Sensitivity experiments suggest that local wind anomalies, through stronger surface heat loss and evaporation, and subsurface upwelling are the primary causes. The present results imply that in coupled models, a proper representation of regional air-sea interactions over the equatorial Indo-Pacific warm pool may be important to understand and predict the amplitude of El Nino...|$|E

40|$|A <b>linear,</b> equatorial, beta-plane <b>atmosphere</b> {{model with}} heating {{parameterized}} {{in terms of}} SST anomalies is developed and used to simulate surface wind anomalies in the equatorial Pacific during El Nino. The model results show some similarity to observations with respect to movement of the major convergence zones, and equatorial wind anomaly patterns in the central and western Pacific. There is considerable discrepancy between the model results and observations {{in much of the}} eastern Pacific, especially in the South Pacific high and southeast trades regions. The results suggest that some additional mechanisms may be responsible for these apparently sizeable and spatially coherent fluctuations, but that a direct link between wind anomalies and SST anomalies may indeed exist in much of the equatorial Pacific...|$|R
40|$|The {{nature of}} global-scale waves that can {{exist in the}} {{atmosphere}} of Venus is examined. A <b>linear</b> three-dimensional model <b>atmosphere</b> with spherical geometry is used to study large-scale forced and free waves. Solutions are obtained numerically with grid points in the vertical and a spherical harmonic expansion in the horizontal. Observations have shown a global-scale traveling wave with phase speed near the cloud-top wind velocity. Global-scale wave modes are found {{to exist in the}} model at this velocity. When a radiative-dynamic cloud feedback is added to the model, the most unstable wave mode is found to have the same phase speed as the observed wave. The horizontal structure of this wave is consistent with the observed horizontal structure of the 'Y' feature seen in ultraviolet images of the Venus cloud top...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: We have {{reported}} an interesting method, named reverse breath figure, for {{the preparation of}} polymeric microsphere patterns. By the same procedure as breath figure, instead of under a humid <b>atmosphere,</b> <b>linear</b> and star-shaped poly(styrene-block-butadiene) copolymers dissolved in solvents such as toluene, trichloroform, and dichloromethane were cast {{onto the surface of}} a glass substrate in methanol or ethanol vapor. After the complete evaporationof the solvent,microsphereswith thediameters ranging fromhundredsof nanometers to several micrometers were prepared. The microsphere patterns are the reverse of the honeycomb porous structure of breath figure. The mechanism of the microsphere formation has been studied to show that when the surface tension of the polymer solution is 1. 5 mN/m higher than that of the condensed liquid, microsphere patterns can be prepared,whereas a honeycombporous filmof breath figure can be obtainedwhen the surface tension of the polymer solution is lower than that of the condensed liquid. The viscosity of the polymer solution is also an important factor to influence the fabrication of the microsphere patterns. 1...|$|R
40|$|A 26 -year {{integration}} {{has been}} performed with a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model (CGCM). The oceanic part resolves all three oceans in the latitude band 70 °N– 70 °S but is dynamically active only between 30 °N and 30 °S. The atmosphere {{is represented by}} a global low-order spectral model. The coupled model was forced by seasonally varying insolation. Although the simulated time-averaged mean conditions in both atmosphere and ocean show significant deviations from the observed climatology, the CGCM realistically simulates the interannual variability in the tropical Pacific. In particular, the CGCM simulates an irregular ENSO with a preferred time scale of about 3 years. The mechanism for the simulated interannual variability in the tropical Pacific is related to both the “delayed action oscillator” and the “slow SST mode. ” It therefore appears likely that either both modes can coexist or they degenerate to one mode within certain locations of the parameter space. This hypothesis is also supported by calculations performed with simplified coupled models, in which the atmospheric GCM was replaced by <b>linear</b> steady-state <b>atmosphere</b> models. Further, evidence is found for an eastward migration of zonal wind anomalies over the western Pacific prior to the extremes of the simulated ENSO, indicating a link to circulation systems over Asia. Because {{an earlier version of}} the CGCM did not simulate interannual variability in the tropical Pacific, additional experiments with a simplified coupled model have been conducted to study the sensitivity of coupled systems to varying mean oceanic background conditions. It is shown that even modest changes in the background conditions can push the coupled system from one flow regime into another...|$|R
40|$|The space-time {{structure}} of interannual sea level variability simulated with two simplified coupled ocean-atmosphere models is investigated {{by means of}} Principal Oscillation Pattern (POP) analysis. Both coupled models consists of an Oceanic General Circulation Model (OGCM) of the tropical Pacific and linear atmospheric feedback. The first coupled model uses an empirical atmospheric feedback derived from data. It simulates low frequency oscillations with periods comparable to the ENSO period {{of a few years}} when driven with white noise. In the second coupled model we use a <b>linear</b> steady state <b>atmosphere</b> model. This coupled model shows quasiperodic oscillations with periods of about 16 months within a certain parameter range. It is shown that the coupling of ocean and atmosphere is an important contribution for the generation of interannual variability. In both coupled models the interannual variability appears to be linked to the propagation of equatorial waves. The results are compared to a run with the uncoupled OGCM driven with observed winds. The resulting variability patterns are similar to those in the coupled experiments. The implications of the results for ENSO prediction are discussed. Reference...|$|R
40|$|Average meteor heights {{have been}} {{continuously}} observed using a SKiYMET VHF radar at Collm (51. 3 ° N, 13. 0 ° E) since late summer of 2004. Initially, the daily mean meteor height was about 89. 4 km. Since that time, average meteor heights have decreased. This {{is consistent with}} earlier results on middle atmosphere temperature change from the literature and from earlier results of low-frequency reflection height changes measured at Kühlungsborn and Collm. During the recent solar minimum 2008 / 2009 the meteor heights further decreased. Linear fitting of a trend and a solar cycle to the heights reveals a linear decrease of about − 56 m year − 1 and a solar cycle effect of + 450 m per 100 sfu. Assuming that meteor heights, on a long-term average, approximately refer {{to a level of}} constant pressure, this decrease can be converted to a mean middle <b>atmosphere</b> <b>linear</b> temperature decrease of − 0. 23 K year − 1 and a solar cycle effect of + 1. 8 K per 100 sfu during the last decade, which is in the range of observed trends reported in the literature...|$|R
40|$|The {{long-term}} {{changes in}} stratospheric ozone in both Antarctic and Arctic regions {{during the period}} November 1978 to October 1986 exhibit significant interhemispheric differences {{in terms of time}} of onset, altitude, latitude, longitude, and phase. The 8 -year data set of stratospheric ozone derived from observations with the Nimbus 7 Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SBUV) spectrometer instrument were deseasonalized by subtracting monthly deviations from 6 -year monthly means for 10 degree bands centered at latitudes 80 S- 80 N and the 64 x 64 standard NMC grid at standard pressure levels in the <b>atmosphere.</b> <b>Linear</b> trends are derived from the linear regression of monthly deviations from long term monthly means in terms of annual and monthly trends for the latitude region 55 to 81 degrees in both hemispheres. An assessment has been made of the SBUV instrument drift from analyses of annual deviations from long term annual means of stratospheric ozone in north temperate regions from 25 N- 55 N with corresponding Umkehr observations from 5 stations at latitudes from 36 N- 52 N which have been corrected for stratospheric aerosols derived from 5 lidar stations (DeLuisi and Mateer, 1988) ...|$|R
40|$|The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) {{provides}} total {{precipitable water}} (TPW) data over land and ocean using near-infrared reflectance at {{a resolution of}} 1 km, which gives it the potential to significantly improve weather forecasts. This study determined the accuracy and biases associated with MODIS TPW data and investigated the impact of its assimilation into the Weather Research and Forecast Model (WRF). A comparison between MODIS TPW and Global Positioning System (GPS) TPW over the United States showed that the root mean square (RMS) differences between these two data sets was about 5. 2 and 3. 3 mm for infrared (IR) and near-infrared (nIR) TPW, respectively. The comparison also showed that there were biases for both retrieved IR and nIR TPW data. The MODIS IR TPW data were overestimated in a dry atmosphere but underestimated in a moist atmosphere. In contrast, the nIR values were slightly underestimated in a dry atmosphere but overestimated in a moist <b>atmosphere.</b> <b>Linear</b> relations were developed to correct the biases associated with these data. The bias correction of MODIS nIR TPW reduced the RMS difference to 2 mm. Comparisons with radiosondes in the US and Australia also showed a similar trend in the differences with MODIS TPW, but with a larger offset, which {{may be associated with}} the previously reported dry bias i...|$|R
40|$|Estimates of {{wave energy}} fluxes {{in the solar}} {{photosphere}} and chromosphere suggest that gravity waves carry more energy than co-spatial acoustic waves. This work presents {{an exploration of the}} upward propagation of gravity waves from the photosphere to the chromosphere, in a realistic model of the solar atmosphere. The purpose is to determine what happens to upward propagating gravity waves when they reach regions where the magnetic forces dominate. Wave motions are assumed <b>linear</b> and the <b>atmosphere</b> is static and horizontally invariant. Dispersion and ray diagrams provide insight into the mode con¬version mechanism. Numerical solution of the linear adiabatic wave equations quantify wave energy fluxes. The analysis shows that typically even weak magnetic fields cause the gravity wave to reflect back downwards as a slow magneto-acoustic wave well before the Alfven-acoustic equipartition level, and it fails to reach the chromosphere. However, highly inclined magnetic fields allow gravity waves to penetrate the equipartition level and experience substantial mode conversion to up-going Alfven waves, or field-guided acoustic waves. Wave energy fluxes are sensitive to the magnetic field orientation and short radiative damping times, but are insensitive to the magnetic field strengths over the range considered (lOG - 100 G). The mode conversion pathways found in adiabatic analyses are preserved in the presence of damping. Mode conversion of gravity waves to Alfven waves is a possible pathway to the upper atmosphere for wave energy. The cause of the high frequency enhancement (the acoustic glory) in seismic power surrounding large active regions with complex field structures is not yet understood. This work presents an investigation of the properties of the seismic emission power and acoustic power of large active regions that have acoustic glories. Helioseismic holography is used to create seismic emission power maps for six large active regions with complex magnetic field structures. Acoustic glories are visible in high-frequency seismic emission power maps (5. 0 mHz - 7. 0 mHz) for all active regions studied. The analysis of acoustic power about large active regions, in high and low frequency regimes, confirms behaviours that are consistent with the findings of previous analyses of smaller active regions. Several new properties of high frequency seismic emission power associated with large active regions are identified: The maximum enhancements in seismic emission and acoustic power occur at different spatial locations; acoustic glories are most prominent in seismic emission power maps in the 5. 0 mHz - 6. 0 mHz bandwidth; the radius of the acoustic glory reduces as frequency increases; and the mean value of high frequency (above 5. 0 mHz) seismic emission power for the active regions studied was enhanced at intermediate line-of-sight magnetic flux densities (50 G - 300 G) ...|$|R
