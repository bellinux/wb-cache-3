5000|$|It {{was around}} that time and {{at the request of}} Vollard that Maillol {{attempted}} to sculpt with Renoir. The old Master, urged on by Vollard, wished to explore sculpting. Handicapped by rheumatoid arthritis, he continued to paint, brushes slipped between his paralysed fingers, protected by narrow bandages. The dealer, who was admiring a medallion the painter had made of his youngest son Claude, took into his head to “find him a pair of hands”. Now Maillol was an accomplished artist, he could only do [...] "Maillol" [...] so... he presented Guino. Vollard, enthusiastic, arranged for him to meet with Renoir in 1913 and hired him at his own expense. An adventure began then between the young sculptor and the old painter, qualified as [...] "miraculous" [...] because of the communion of spirit and sensitivity which developed between the two artists. This collaboration lasted until 1918, in Essoyes first then at the “Collettes”, Renoir's villa in Cagnes-sur-Mer in Provence. This resulted in the creation of an ensemble of pieces considered at the zenith of modern sculpture: the Small Venus, the Venus victrix, the Judgement of Pâris, and the <b>Large</b> <b>Washer</b> Woman. When Renoir died in 1919, the sculptures were publicised and exploited as his alone by Vollard then by Renou.|$|E
50|$|Whirlpool {{produces}} <b>large</b> residential <b>washers</b> in the United States {{under the}} Whirlpool, Maytag, Roper, Estate, Admiral, Amana, and Crosley brands.|$|R
50|$|Three {{models were}} {{available}} in Canada: Base (cloth interior, no ABS, no moonroof, no cruise control, unpainted foglight cover, unpainted side skirt, 15-inch steel wheels with wheel covers, essentially an Integra iS.), Premium (Moonroof, 16-inch alloy wheels, heated seats) and Type-S. The A-Spec package was available to the Type-S models. Canadian RSX had a significantly <b>larger</b> <b>washer</b> sprayer bottle to deal with harsher weather. They were 4.5 litres vs. 2.5 litres for USDM cars.|$|R
25|$|Good {{practices}} in modern, earthquake-resistant structures dictate {{that there be}} good vertical connections throughout every component of the building, from undisturbed or engineered earth to foundation to sill plate to vertical studs to plate cap through each floor and continuing to the roof structure. Above the foundation and sill plate the connections are typically made using steel strap or sheet stampings, nailed to wood members using special hardened high-shear strength nails, and heavy angle stampings secured with through bolts, using <b>large</b> <b>washers</b> to prevent pull-through. Where inadequate bolts are provided between the sill plates and a foundation in existing construction (or are not trusted due to possible corrosion), special clamp plates may be added, {{each of which is}} secured to the foundation using expansion bolts inserted into holes drilled in an exposed face of concrete. Other members must then be secured to the sill plates with additional fittings.|$|R
50|$|Since 1989, Bauknecht Hausgeräte GmbH {{has been}} part of the American group Whirlpool Corporation. The Neunkirchen {{facility}} in Saarland developed and built dishwashers from 1971. In 1996, the European Technology Centre for dishwashers was also settled in Neunkirchen. The Global Development Center for washing machines and dryers, in which the <b>large</b> volume <b>washers</b> for the US market were produced was sited in Schorndorf.|$|R
50|$|A pin and hanger {{assembly}} {{is used to}} connect two plate girders of a bridge. These assemblies are used to provide an expansion joint in the bridge. One beam (the anchor span) is set on a pier with a short section cantilevered out toward the next pier. The other (the suspended span) begins underneath the anchor span, and has its far end resting on the next pier. The beams have holes directly above each other. The two holes are connected using hangers, a pair of connecting plates sandwiching the bridge girders. A pair of large steel pins through the plates and girder webbing provide the hinges, holding up the suspended span while allowing it to move longitudinally. <b>Large</b> <b>washers</b> are bolted to {{each end of the}} pin to retain the hangers. Exceptionally long spans may have two sets of girders cantilevered from opposite bridge piers with a third set of girders suspended by pin and hanger assemblies from both cantilevers.|$|R
2500|$|The second {{generation}} Umnumzaan saw numerous modifications that utilizes {{some of the}} newer technologies found on the Sebenza 25. The single-most visual change was replacing the oversized custom pivot with a more traditional (Sebenza-style) pivot brushing. This new pivot no longer requires the Umnumzaan Take-down Tool and instead a traditional hex wrench {{is all that is}} needed to disassemble and reassemble the knife. This pivot is larger than most blade pivot brushing systems and is identical to the one used on the newer Large Sebenza 25 (mid-2012 release and with a pivot that is significantly thicker than the pivot used on the previous Large Sebenza 21). This pivot also incorporates a newer generation <b>washer</b> system with <b>larger</b> <b>washer</b> perforations, which helps retain lubricating grease better than previous designs, while simultaneously keeping elements out of the pivot system to increase service intervals. The change in pivot and washers is complimented by the modifications made to the ceramic ball and detent system, in which a larger ceramic ball in a slightly different location is used to make opening smoother and reduce wear (although it is unclear as to exactly when this specific change began).|$|R
50|$|An {{anchor plate}} or wall <b>washer</b> is a <b>large</b> plate or <b>washer</b> {{connected}} to a tie rod or bolt. Anchor plates are used on exterior walls of masonry buildings, for structural reinforcement. Being visible, many anchor plates are made in a style that is decorative.|$|R
50|$|An aqueous-based parts washer is {{much like}} a <b>large</b> dish <b>washer.</b> It uses water and {{detergent}} combined with heat and mechanical energy to provide the cleaning action. There are two main process styles of aqueous parts washers, the jet spray process and the power wash process. In a cabinet parts washer, the parts are placed on a turntable and the door is closed. During the cleaning cycle heated solution is flooded or blasted on the parts as the turntable rotates. Many systems have a wash, rinse and dry cycle. When the cycle is complete the door is opened and the parts removed.|$|R

40|$|Electrical power {{generation}} {{is paid for}} {{on the basis of}} the marginal costs of generation, and supply is paid for at the marginal cost at the supply point. In the case where power lines form a loop and there is a limit on a line within the loop, the electrical requirements of providing supply force a reallocation of generation and a step change in the marginal costs. This is known as the spring washer effect. In some cases the cost of supply can reach extreme levels. Transpower and its customers are interested in obtaining a better understanding of these events. Simplified equations determining {{power generation}} and pricing are derived. So-lutions for the supply costs are obtained for several simple cases. Numerical exam-ples and a graphical representation demonstrate the spring washer effect and how a spring washer responds to changes. Several possible changes that reduce the cost of supply are demonstrated. When a spring washer comes active the marginal prices make a step change. This means that power costs can be be highly sensitive to the values of all the network parameters that affect the power flow in the power loop. Detecting when a <b>large</b> spring <b>washer</b> is likely to occur is of considerable interest. Suggestions on how this could be done are made. 1...|$|R
50|$|There {{were other}} factors easing the {{pressure}} on the student. One of the most important steps was to eliminate the complications of noise and recoil when the gun was fired, which the use of the BB gun as the training aid did. The second step was to make it as easy as possible for the student to begin hitting the target right away. To do that, McDaniel not only threw up a <b>large</b> flat <b>washer</b> for the student, but also lofted it straight up into the air, parallel to the ground, and gave it a spin for added stability. This presented the student with the easiest possible target. But if the student could not begin hitting that target quickly, then McDaniel would switch to a larger target. Occasionally, he would find it necessary to throw up an aluminum pie-plate right above the muzzle of the student's BB gun with the goal of getting the student to hit the target regularly, as it was then just a matter of shrinking the size of the target in small steps. The final factor here was that McDaniel was not a sadistic shooting instructor. He liked people and thoroughly enjoyed teaching them to shoot, and he let that show, nurturing his students and letting them know that he was on their side. All of those factors combined to give the student great confidence.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{development of}} a system based on a high-transition-temperature {{superconducting quantum interference device}} (high- T c SQUID) magnetometer. The system has been designed and used for magnetic field recordings from brain slices, i. e. magnetophysiology. Magnetophysiology is a complementary method to electrophysiology, which is routinely used today. One aim of magnetophysiology is to aid in the assessment of the full nature of the signals in magnetoencephalography (MEG), which is a method for multi-channel whole-head recordings of magnetic fields from the brain. Dipole models of post-synaptic currents have been used to determine the magnetic fields above hippocampal slices. These simulations indicate that a high- T c SQUID system with a sensor-to-sample separation as small as 65  µm would have superior signal-to-noise ratio compared with the low- T c SQUID systems previously used elsewhere. A directly-coupled magnetometer with a side length of 2 ~mm has been fabricated from a YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -δ thin film. The <b>large</b> input <b>washer</b> was composed of strips of 5  µm width in order to prevent flux-trapping. The magnetic field noise of the magnetometer was 0. 75  pT/Hz 1 / 2 and the effective area was 0. 071  mm 2. A successful method has been developed for the ∼ 20  min transportation of the slices to the measurement lab. Evoked magnetic fields from transverse hippocampal slices from rats have been recorded. The magnetic fields were ∼ 5  pT and showed a high correlation with the excitatory post-synaptic potential measured in close connection to the magnetic field recordings. With further development of the system, {{it may be possible to}} verify a higher signal-to-noise ratio than experienced in low- T c SQUID systems. This would enable fewer averages, resulting in shorter experiments. Magnetic field studies of less dense brain structures than the hippocampus could be possible...|$|R
