40|$|Numerical {{studies on}} a recent large {{high-rise}} building fire in Hong Kong are reported. Preliminary studies suggested that a <b>lift</b> <b>shaft</b> under refurbishment {{with all of its}} doors removed was the key factor in the fire spreading. This point is investigated in this paper by simulating the fire environment using a fire-zone model and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Different scenarios with a fire starting at the <b>lift</b> <b>shaft</b> and also starting at a higher level were considered. Five sets of zone-model simulations and three sets of CFD simulations were performed. The importance of providing a lift lobby was demonstrated. It is further confirmed that this <b>lift</b> <b>shaft</b> would create many problems. A <b>lift</b> <b>shaft,</b> even undergoing refurbishment, should not have its doors kept opened.

50|$|The {{station was}} {{constructed}} by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway and was built with two <b>lift</b> <b>shafts,</b> but only one was ever used for <b>lifts.</b> The second <b>shaft</b> {{was the site of}} an experimental spiral escalator which was built by the American inventor of escalators, Jesse W. Reno. The experiment was not successful and was never used by the public. In the 1990s, remains of the escalator equipment were excavated {{from the base of the}} <b>lift</b> <b>shaft</b> and stored at the London Transport Museum Depot in Acton. From the platforms, a second exit no longer in use is visible and leads to the back of the used <b>lift</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|R

40|$|Fires {{safety in}} older {{high-rise}} buildings {{is of great}} concern {{to the general public}} {{as a result of a}} large fire which recently occurred in an existing high-rise building in Hong Kong. Further to the preliminary analysis on three points identified earlier, another key point is the smoke movement in the <b>lift</b> <b>shaft.</b> This information is important as it would affect the fire safety requirements in these class of buildings. The smoke movement pattern in a <b>lift</b> <b>shaft</b> was studied with a scale model. Three cases were considered with the fire at the bottom of the lift shaft; in a compartment next to the lower part of the lift shaft; and in a compartment next to the upper part of the <b>lift</b> <b>shaft.</b> Empirical correlations of smoke travel time were derived from the results reported in this study.

50|$|Marriott {{sold the}} park to Six Flags, then owned by Bally Manufacturing, in 1984. Thus the Bally's Six Flags Great America era began. It started darkly when a {{software}} failure caused a car on the drop ride The Edge to be stalled {{at the top of}} the <b>lift</b> <b>shaft</b> before moving forward into its drop position. The car was stuck in this position for a short period of time before it dropped in the <b>lift</b> <b>shaft,</b> causing injuries to all three occupants. Despite many attempts to reopen The Edge with installation of anti-rollback devices by Intamin, the ride was never able to escape the stigma of its 1984 accident. The ride was removed in 1986 and sold to Rocky Point Amusement Park before reaching its final location at Geauga Lake as Mr. Hyde's Nasty Fall. The ride was dismantled and scrapped in 2005.|$|R
