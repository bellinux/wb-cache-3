50|$|As {{other members}} of the class were being put to the cutters torch, Eastleigh {{performed}} a <b>light</b> <b>overhaul</b> on 74010 and returned it to fully servicable condition. In 1978, it was towed to Derby depot for evaluation as a potential candidate for departmental use at the Railway Technical Centre and remained in the depot yard for some time. Despite being in fully working order with a mass of spares available (from sister locomotives now scrapped) it was eventually deemed unsuitable, towed to Doncaster and scrapped in 1979.|$|E
50|$|In 2012 the ex-Wrexham & Shropshire Mark 3s were {{overhauled}} {{fitted with}} sliding plug doors (similar to those fitted to South West Trains' Class 444 Desiros) and toilet retention tanks by Wabtec. Once this programme is complete, a further ten Mark 3s will be overhauled by Wabtec {{to create a}} fifth set and bring the existing sets up to six coaches. In 2012 the DB-Regio-owned Mark 3s used on the peak-hour Banbury service were given a <b>light</b> <b>overhaul</b> at LNWR, Bristol, and the Virgin-liveried examples repainted into British Rail blue/grey.|$|E
50|$|While {{they may}} have been {{considered}} the second worst operating revenue service car during the 1980s based on MDBF (Mean Distance Between Failures), doing better than only the R46s, many R10s outlasted the newer R16s {{as well as a number}} of R27s and R30s. There was a <b>light</b> <b>overhaul</b> program for 110 of the WH cars between December 1984 and February 1986 in an effort to get the entire fleet in a non-graffiti state. The rehabilitation of the select R10s was done in-house at a budgeted cost of $65,000 per car.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{acquisitions}} and projects include Mercato in Naples, Florida; The Wharf in Washington D.C. {{which will include}} a <b>lighting</b> <b>overhaul</b> of the Case Bridge; and the purchase of Pacific Place in Seattle, Washington. Recent repositioning of centers includes the rebranding of University Mall in Chapel Hill, North Carolina to University Place.|$|R

50|$|The Blue Streak line {{of premium}} impact parts was {{introduced}} in the 1930s. In 1947 Standard acquired Hygrade Products Co. The product line was expanded to include speedometer cables, carburetor repair parts, shock-absorber parts, and fuel pumps. In 1950 Standard introduced the Hygrade System, simplified carburetor kits for tune-ups and <b>light</b> <b>overhauls.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1926/7 the GWR sorted their RODs {{into two}} batches. The {{original}} 3000-19 and 3020-49 were considered good engines and given proper overhaul and Swindon fittings, including top feed and brass safety valve casing. The remainder were renumbered 3050-3099, given a <b>light</b> <b>overhaul</b> {{and then ran}} until they failed, when they were withdrawn [...] - [...] all were gone by 1930. There was some swapping of numbers, so that engines in better condition were given the lower numbers. The leading dimensions of the GWR 3000 Class {{were the same as}} the GCR Class 8K except that the GWR increased the boiler pressure to [...] which increased the tractive effort to 32,200 lb or [...]|$|E
50|$|Further {{modifications}} {{were made}} in the late 1950s. As the Standards were nearing the end of their useful service life, the New York City Transit Authority set up a plan to retire the cars {{by the end of the}} 1960s. Trailers were to be retired first, in the early part of the 1960s. This was a matter of practicality since all trailer cars in the New York City Subway were being phased out. Motor cars would be retired next, starting with the oldest cars (cars 2000-2299, along with a few 2300's). The rest of the fleet would need to serve longer until new car orders could replace them, so cars 2400-2799 were to receive a <b>light</b> <b>overhaul</b> to allow them to serve through the 1960s. Car 2899 was also overhauled, as it was part of a three-car set with two cars (2700's) that fell within the scope of the program. Cars 2800-2898 were not overhauled as they had a non-standard group box switch. The remaining 2300's and the 2800's were retired during the mid-1960s; and the overhauled cars continued in service until the last train operated on August 4, 1969, in Myrtle-Chambers service.. Overhauled cars received sealed beam headlights to illuminate tunnels. In addition, their interiors were revitalized with new light fixtures and seat cushions. Overhauled cars also received a more modern General Electric propulsion control package during this time, which was believed by the Transit Authority to be an upgrade over the older Westinghouse packages. About half the overhauled cars were so equipped.|$|E
50|$|The General Overhaul Program (GOH) was a mid-life {{overhaul}} {{program for}} neglected subway cars which involved thorough rebuilding of the fleet. Since {{the completion of}} the GOH program, the new Scheduled Maintenance System (SMS) program has replaced the GOH program by ensuring that trains do not reach a state in which they would need such an overhaul. The car types which were part of the MTA NYCT GOH program are the IRT Redbirds (R26, R28, R29, R33, R33 WF, R36, R36 WF), as well as IND/BMT cars (R30 GE, R32, R38, R40, R40A, R42, R44 and R46). These cars were rebuilt between 1985 and 1992. Some cars in various classes from R10 to R46 were also given <b>lighter</b> <b>overhauls</b> during this period.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, a major {{renovation}} {{took place in}} which the adjacent building was acquired and integrated into the existing facility. During that time, the stage <b>lighting</b> was <b>overhauled</b> to include low heat/power LED lighting, and the stage was enlarged to provide more area for touring bands.|$|R
50|$|In 2005 Ron Mitten {{was elected}} President of the Association of Electrical and Mechanical Trades (AEMT) an {{international}} association representing leading {{companies in the}} service and repair industry and a <b>light</b> traction motor <b>overhaul</b> facility was opened.|$|R
25|$|Renovations were {{completed}} in 2000 that cost {{approximately the same}} as the original construction price ($21 million in current currency). Renovations between 1999 and 2000 included the SkyCity restaurant, SpaceBase retail store, Skybeam installation, Observation Deck <b>overhaul,</b> <b>lighting</b> additions and repainting.|$|R
