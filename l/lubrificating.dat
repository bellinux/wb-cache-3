40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} for thin film coatings for dry machining technologies which display both high hardness and low friction properties. Ti-B-N coatings are multiphase coatings and can be deposited {{in such a way}} that they contain the two hard phases TiB 2 and TiN, and in addition the soft and <b>lubrificating</b> hexagonal BN phase. By a suitable choice of the relative content of these phases coating properties can be tailored. In this paper we examine two types of coatings: 1) homogeneous multiphase Yi-B-N coatings by reactive sputtering from a TiB 2 target; 2) coatings of the same type in which carbon ions have been implanted (Ti-B-N-C). Bonding type and phase composition were determined by photo electron spectroscopy and glancing angle X-ray diffractometry. Hardness measurements were performed by nanoindentation, and friction tests were carried out using both the pin-on-disk and pin on-flat geometry with a 100 Cr 6 steel ball as the counterface. Ultra hard coatings were obtained if the coatings were composed of the two hard phases TiB 2 and TiN, but the addition of the BN phase produced no lubricating effect. However, carbon implanted Ti-B-N layers showed a strong reduction of the friction coefficient. JRC. (IAM) -Institute For Advanced Material...|$|E

Desta forma, políticas ambientais são cada dia mais severas, com o intuito de diminuir a concentração deste componente nos derivados de petróleo, incorrendo assim em custos adicionais para a indústria do petróleo, objetivando a diminuição de compostos sulfurados em seus produtos. Estes compostos são geralmente retirados das correntes de destilados por processo catalítico de hidrogenação, sob condições de elevadas temperaturas e pressões, chamado de hidrotratamento (HDT), sendo assim, um processo de elevado custo operacional. A adsorção se mostra como um {{excelente}} processo de pré ou póstratamento das correntes de HDT, por operar em baixas pressões e temperaturas, diminuindo assim as condições severas de processamento e da mesma forma os custos de capital e operacional. A literatura já traz trabalhos relacionados à dessulfurização por adsorção de destilados leves que originam combustíveis tais como gasolina, óleo diesel e combustível de aviação. Porém, os destilados de petróleo mais pesados que originam óleos lubrificantes, ainda não foram abordados na literatura com relação à aplicação do método adsortivo para dessulfurização. Os lubrificantes possuem um valor agregado cerca de três vezes maior que os combustíveis convencionais, possuindo assim um grande atrativo econômico. Desta forma, no presente de trabalho foi estudada a adsorção de compostos orgânicos sulfurados em destilados pesados naftênicos industriais e sintéticos, utilizando carvão ativado como adsorvente. O carvão ativado foi escolhido devido à sua grande capacidade de adsorção a uma grande gama de compostos organo-sulfurados, reportadas em trabalhos científicos para combustíveis convencionais. O estudo adsortivo consistiu no levantamento de isotermas de equilíbrio, tanto para frações naftênicas de petróleo, como para compostos sintéticos, objetivando a determinação da capacidade e seletividade adsortiva do carvão; da mesma forma, houve o estudo de curvas cinéticas de adsorção, visando à determinação do comportamento difusivo do sistema em estudo. As influências da temperatura, da massa molecular, da presença de inibidores (água, fenol, naftaleno e carbazol) e da concentração inicial de compostos sulfurados usualmente presentes em destilados pesados foram determinadas em processo de batelada. Foram desenvolvidos modelos para representar o processo adsortivo em estudo e um algoritmo para a predição do comportamento cinético do sistema via simulação numérica. Os resultados encontrados mostraram que, de uma forma geral, o aumento da massa molecular das moléculas sulfuradas presentes nos destilados naftênicos, assim como, a presença de moléculas de outras classes orgânicas, atuando como inibidores, desfavoreceram o fenômeno adsortivo dos compostos sulfurados sobre o carvão ativado. Já o aumento da temperatura favoreceu a adsorção dos compostos sulfurados dos destilados de petróleo, devido a uma possível resistência difusional de acesso aos sítios ativos do carvão, a qual diminuiu com o aumento da temperatura, ou seja, o aumento da energia interna das moléculas. Sulfur is {{a component}} of the oil, {{which is one of the}} most dangerous pollutants that exist at the environmental. Therefore politics are harder to decrease the sulfur concentration in refined oils that increase the oil industry costs. This component is normally extracted by hydrogen catalytic processes of distilled streams, at high pressures and temperatures, called hydrotreatment (HDT). The adsorption is presented as an excellent treatment of the inner and outers HDT streams, decreasing their severity, capital and operation costs. The literature shows works which are related with distilled oils desulfurization by adsorption, that origin fuels like gasoline, óleo diesel and aviation fuel. However, the heavier distilled oils which originate <b>lubrificating</b> base oil were not studied yet about the use of adsorption methods to desulfurization. These <b>lubrificating</b> base oils have monetary values about two or three times higher than the conventional fossil fuels, having a great economic attractive. Therefore, the sulfur species adsorption in commercial and synthetic naphthenic heavy distilled oils, using activated carbon as adsorbent was studied in this work. The activated carbon was chosen due to its high capacities adsorption to great variety of sulfur compounds, reported in scientific works to conventional fossil fuels. The adsorption study was based on thermodynamic adsorption on synthetic and real distillates, getting adsorbent capacities and selectivities, and on kinetics adsorption determining diffusivity behavior of the systems. The temperature, molecular size, inhibitors presence (water, phenol, naphtalene and carbazole) and initial concentration influences of the common sulfur species encountered in heavy distillates were determine in batch experiments. Models were developed to represent de experimental data and a numeric algorithm was made to predict the kinetic behavior of the system. In general, the results showed that the sulfur molecular size increasing and the presence of molecules with other molecular composition, acting as inhibitors, decrease the adsorption of sulfur compounds on activated carbon. However, the temperature increasing gives a better sulfur compounds adsorption to petroleum distillates, due to a possible diffusional resistance of activated sites access, which is decreased to higher temperatures, due to molecular internal energy increasing.

40|$|Abstract The {{epithelial}} tissue is constitute of various columnar cell types that build the covering of the intestine. In {{the length of}} the intestine, and all mucosal tissues, are disperse some goblet cells. These cells are unicellular glands and they produce glycoproteins called mucins, which give mucus its specific viscoelastic physical and chemical properties. Mucins are a group of glycoproteins secreted from the respiratory epithelium, gastrointestinal and genital tract. The reason of development for an epithelial barrier is to separate metazoan from the external environment. This was necessitate by the evolution of defence mechanisms that implicate mucins. These are very important because they have the function to <b>lubrificate</b> the various organs and to protect them from the attack of chemical and bacterial agents. Mucus provides protective functions in the gastrointestinal tract and {{plays an important role in}} the adhesion of microorganisms to host surfaces, including families such as probiotic Lactobacillus strains. The mucus is mainly present in the colon, whereas the presence of bacteria in the digestive tract is greater. Some studies indicate that intestinal microbes and compound like polyphenol, or dairy products may influence goblet cell dynamics and the mucus layer. This happens or directly by the local release of bioactive factors or indirectly by activation of the host immune cells. The alteration of the gene expression of mucin appears to be correlate with the development of inflammatory diseases or tumors. The subject of these thesis is a genic expression analysis of four mucins (MUC 2, MUC 3 A, MUC 13 and MUC 17) related by probiotic bacteria, polyphenol and dairy products...|$|R
40|$|The {{procuticle}} of the Crustacea Decapoda {{is formed}} of stacked laminae composed of fibre beds {{in which the}} fibres run parallel {{to the surface and}} undergo a slight and progressive change in orientation from one bed to another. The basic structural unit of the procuticle is a microfibril made up of a core of chitin criystallite surrounded by a protein sheath. Microfibrils arise at the surface of plasmamembrane plaques which are concerned with their deposition and orientation. According to the degree of mineralization, microfibrils are either homogeneously distributed (membranous layer) or secondarily associated into reticulate structures (pigmented layer) or into macrofibres (principal layer). In the newly secreted procuticular sheets the chitin-proteic fibres are disposed around long vertical microvilli originating from the epidermis. The plasmamembrane of the microvilli appears to be closely concerned with the deposition of fibrous components running vertically. Progressively the microvilli degenerate and leave hollow twisted tubes, the cuticular canals (pore canals), delimited by a helical fibre sheath. These canals may project lateral connections and constitute routes through which material involved in cuticle hardening can gain access to the external laminae. The membranous layer, deposited a long time after ecdysis, is not mineralized and exhibits a peculiar chemical composition as well as hygroscopic properties. It keeps hydrolytic enzymes in store during the preecdysial period and plays the role of <b>lubrificating</b> agent at the critical moment of ecdydis. The enzymatic degradation of the old cuticle during the preecdysial period is characterized by an important decrease of chitin and soluble protein contents. In contrast, the cuticular calcium is not reabsorbed, at least in Cancer pagurus and Carcinus maenas. Peer reviewe...|$|E
