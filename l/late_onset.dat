5|$|The {{disorder}} {{has been}} reported in more than 100 families worldwide, though some sources cite up to 400 families, and it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. It is considered to be under-diagnosed because of the variability in its expression. The pattern of mutations and spectrum of symptoms are heterogeneous between individuals.

5|$|The <b>late</b> <b>onset</b> of Huntington's disease {{means it}} does not usually affect reproduction. The {{worldwide}} prevalence of HD is 5–10 cases per 100,000 persons, but varies greatly geographically {{as a result of}} ethnicity, local migration and past immigration patterns. Prevalence is similar for men and women. The rate of occurrence is highest in peoples of Western European descent, averaging around 7 per 100,000 people, and is lower {{in the rest of the}} world; e.g., one per million people of Asian and African descent. A 2013 epidemiological study of the prevalence of Huntington's disease in the UK between 1990 and 2010 found that the average prevalence for the UK was 12.3 per 100,000. Additionally, some localized areas have a much higher prevalence than their regional average. One of the highest incidences is in the isolated populations of the Lake Maracaibo region of Venezuela, where HD affects up to 700 per 100,000 persons. Other areas of high localization have been found in Tasmania and specific regions of Scotland, Wales and Sweden. Increased prevalence in some cases occurs due to a local founder effect, a historical migration of carriers into an area of geographic isolation. Some of these carriers have been traced back hundreds of years using genealogical studies. Genetic haplotypes can also give clues for the geographic variations of prevalence. Iceland, on the contrary, has a rather low prevalence of 1 per 100,000, despite the fact that Icelanders as a people are descended of the early Germanic tribes of Scandinavia which also gave rise to the Swedes; all cases with the exception of one going back nearly two centuries having derived from the offspring of a couple living early in the 19th century. Finland, as well, has a low incidence of only 2.2 per 100,000 people.|$|E

40|$|Ensembles of {{retrospective}} 2 -month dynamical forecasts {{initiated on}} 1 May {{are used to}} predict {{the onset of the}} Indian summer monsoon (ISM) for the period 1989 – 2005. The subseasonal predictions (SSPs) are based on a coupled general circulation model and recently they have been upgraded by the realistic initialization of the atmosphere with initial conditions taken from reanalysis. Two objective large-scale methods based on dynamical circulation and hydrological indices are applied to detect the ISM onset. The SSPs show some skill in forecasting earlier-than-normal ISM onsets, while they have difficulty in predicting <b>late</b> <b>onsets.</b> It is shown that significant contribution to the skill in forecasting early ISM onsets comes from the newly developed initialization of the atmosphere from reanalysis. On one hand, atmospheric initialization produces a better representation of the atmospheric mean state in the initial conditions, leading to a systematically improved monsoon onset sequence. On the other hand, the initialization of the atmosphere allows some skill in forecasting the northward propagating intraseasonal wind and precipitation anomalies over the tropical Indian Ocean. The northward propagating intraseasonal modes trigger the monsoon in some early-onset years. The realistic phase initialization of these modes improves the forecasts of the associated earlier-than-normal monsoon onsets. The prediction of <b>late</b> <b>onsets</b> is not noticeably improved by the initialization of the atmosphere. It is suggested that <b>late</b> <b>onsets</b> of the monsoon are too far away from the start date of the forecasts to conserve enough memory of the intraseasonal oscillation (ISO) anomalies and of the improved representation of the mean state in the initial conditions...|$|R

25|$|Another study {{compared}} nineteen {{children with}} a history of ADEM, of which 10 were five years of age or younger at the time (average age 3.8 years old, tested an average of 3.9 years later) and nine were older (mean age 7.7y at time of ADEM, tested an average of 2.2 years later) to nineteen matched controls. Scores on IQ tests and educational achievement were lower for the young onset ADEM group (average IQ 90) compared to the <b>late</b> <b>onset</b> (average IQ 100) and control groups (average IQ 106), while the <b>late</b> <b>onset</b> ADEM children scored lower on verbal processing speed. Again, all groups means were within one standard deviation of the controls, meaning that while effects were statistically reliable, the children were as a whole, still within the normal range. There were also more behavioural problems in the early onset group, although there is some suggestion that this may be due, at least in part, to the stress of hospitalization at a young age.|$|E

25|$|Different {{strains of}} Triticeae exist for {{different}} industrial applications; durum for pasta and food pastes, {{two types of}} barley for beer, bread wheats used in different areas with different growing conditions. Replacing these motifs is not a plausible task since a contamination of 0.02% wheat in a gluten-free diet {{is considered to be}} pathogenic and would require replacing the motifs in all known regional varieties—potentially thousands of genetic modifications. Class I and antibody responses are downstream of Class II recognition and are of little remedial value in change. The innate response peptide could be a silver bullet, assuming there is only one of these per protein and only a few genome loci with the protein. Unresolved questions relevant to a complete understanding of immune responses to gluten are: Why is the rate of <b>late</b> <b>onset</b> gluten sensitivity rapidly rising?

25|$|Compound {{heterozygosity}} ultimately {{explains the}} disease's variability, including the late-onset forms. The disease can potentially {{result from the}} inheritance of two unrelated mutations in the HEXA gene, one from each parent. Classic infantile Tay–Sachs disease results when a child has inherited mutations from both parents that completely stop the biodegradation of gangliosides. <b>Late</b> <b>onset</b> forms occur due to the diverse mutation basenbsp&– people with Tay–Sachs disease may technically be heterozygotes, with two differing HEXA mutations that both inactivate, alter, or inhibit enzyme activity.

25|$|GAPDH {{has been}} implicated in several {{neurodegenerative}} diseases and disorders, largely through interactions with other proteins specific to that disease or disorder. These interactions may affect not only energy metabolism but also other GAPDH functions. For example, GAPDH interactions with beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP) could interfere with its function regarding the cytoskeleton or membrane transport, while interactions with huntingtin could interfere with its function regarding apoptosis, nuclear tRNA transport, DNA replication, and DNA repair. In addition, nuclear translocation of GAPDH {{has been reported in}} Parkinson's disease (PD), and several anti-apoptotic PD drugs, such as rasagiline, function by preventing the nuclear translocation of GAPDH. It is proposed that hypometabolism may be one contributor to PD, but the exact mechanisms underlying GAPDH involvement in neurodegenerative disease remains to be clarified. The SNP rs3741916 in the 5' UTR of the GAPDH gene may be associated with <b>late</b> <b>onset</b> Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
25|$|There are {{no common}} {{mutations}} that cause disease, however 10 - 15% of disease causing mutations are deletions. It is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner, meaning males are more commonly affected than females. Females who carry a defective {{copy of the}} gene can be severely affected or asymptomatic, largely depending on the random nature of X-inactivation. There is some degree of genotype - phenotype correlation with OTC deficiency, but this depends {{on a number of}} situations. Individuals with milder mutations, often associated with <b>late</b> <b>onset</b> disease can still present with severe illness when exposed to sufficient metabolic stress. Correlations are more difficult to ascertain in females, since the residual activity of OTC in the liver is impacted not only {{by the nature of the}} mutation, but also by the random pattern of X-inactivation. OTC deficiency is estimated to be the most common urea cycle disorder. An exact incidence is difficult to calculate, due to the varying clinical presentations of later onset forms of the disease. Early estimates of the incidence were as high as 1:14,000 live births, however later studies have decreased these estimates to approximately 1:60,000 - 1:72,000.|$|E
