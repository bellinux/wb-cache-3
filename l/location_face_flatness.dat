40|$|Machining {{processes}} are met with dimensional and geometrical variations in a product during machining operation. The {{amount of variation}} {{needs to be more}} strictly defined for accurately machined parts. Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) definition provides the precision required for allowing manufacturing of most economical parts. Crankshaft flange is required to be machined with higher degree of precision. If geometrical accuracies are not met the crankshaft-flywheel assembly will cause wear, unbalance and vibration, leading to poor functionality. The face of crankshaft flange is evaluated for geometric tolerances- flatness and runout. A two level three factor factorial model is designed and analyzed on Minitab 16 software to identify the most affecting machining parameter among speed, feed and depth of cut on <b>face</b> <b>flatness</b> and <b>face</b> runout...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} solve the slowly {{processing}} speed, low precision problems in the <b>Face</b> <b>location</b> and detection, the comprehensive <b>face</b> <b>location</b> algorithm based on composite skin color was proposed in this paper. The YCrCb model algorithm and HSV model algorithm are skillfully applied to the comprehensive <b>face</b> <b>location</b> algorithm. The human body region and background region can be detected and judged by the color value of every pixel for image in the YCrCb and HSV space. Then, the connecting region can be screened and decided by the geometric features of human face, and the face can be accurately located and detected. The experimental results confirm that the algorithm can achieve the accuracy ratio of <b>face</b> <b>location</b> in three cases, such as simple, medium and complexity, are 99 %, 92 % and 85 %, respectively. Furthermore, the accuracy ratio of <b>face</b> <b>location</b> and detection speed was improved in this algorithm...|$|R
