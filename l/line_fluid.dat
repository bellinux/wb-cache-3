40|$|A {{moving contact}} {{line is the}} {{idealized}} line of intersection between two immiscible fluids as one displaces the other along a solid boundary. The displacement process {{has been the subject}} of a large amount of theoretical and experimental research; however, the fundamental processes that govern contact line motion are still unknown. The challenge from an experimental perspective is to make measurements with high enough resolution to validate competing theories. An experimental method has been developed to simultaneously measure interface motion, dynamic contact angles, and local fluid velocity fields using micron-resolution Particle Image Velocimetry (µPIV). Capillary numbers range from 1. 7 x 10 ^(⁻⁴) to 6. 2 x 10 ^(⁻⁴). Interface velocities were measured between 1. 7 µm/s and 33 µm/s. Dynamic contact angles were manually measured between 1. 1 µm and 120 µm from the contact line, and calculated from µPIV data to within several hundred nanometers from the contact <b>line.</b> <b>Fluid</b> velocities were measured over two orders of magnitude closer to the contact line than published values with an increase in resolution of over 3400 %. The appearance of a recirculation zone similar to controversial prediction below previously published limits demonstrates the power and significance of the method...|$|E
40|$|Design and {{analytical}} modeling considerations associated with recirculating flow in piping systems with tee and Y connections are presented. Flow recirculation, in many process piping networks, can produce nonsteady flow and associated thermal conditions. In the flow recirculation discussion, experimental data is presented for a 90 degree branch piping (tee connection) using four different branch pipe sizes {{over a wide}} velocity range [Coffield and Kolar (1990) ]. The discussion also includes recent test data for a 45 degree, Y connected, branch piping design. Designers can use this information by directly applying the limiting conditions that are presented at the design stage, or in evaluating the performance of existing systems. For example, although flow recirculation may result in complicated flow patterns, it often can have the beneficial effect of mixing low velocity branch <b>line</b> <b>fluid</b> with the primary system fluid as it approaches the intersection. In branch pipe systems where flows are at different temperatures this recirculation helps attenuate the potential for large thermal stresses. The recirculation flow patterns are strongly affected by the branch angle and thus they are presented {{as a function of}} the branch angle...|$|E
40|$|A new {{technique}} ("microlavage") {{was used to}} determine the volume of epithelial <b>lining</b> <b>fluid</b> recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage. A standard bronchial brush tube is used to lavage a peripheral lung subsegment rapidly with 20 ml of normal saline and the concentrations of urea and total protein are measured in the aspirated fluid. Using a very short dwell time for fluid (less than 20 seconds), this technique allows the urea dilution method to be used to quantify the epithelial <b>lining</b> <b>fluid</b> protein concentration, which is then used as an endogenous marker of the epithelial <b>lining</b> <b>fluid</b> in conventional bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The reproducibility of the calculation of the concentration of the <b>lining</b> <b>fluid</b> protein was assessed in 10 patients by performing the method in three separate lung subsegments. The mean coefficient of variation of the urea to protein ratio was 9. 0 %. A comparison of microlavage and conventional lavage was made in a further 28 patients. The differential cell counts were similar by the two methods, suggesting that similar epithelial <b>lining</b> <b>fluid</b> was sampled. The application of the microlavage technique to the calculation of epithelial <b>lining</b> <b>fluid</b> volume gave a lower value than the urea dilution method in association with conventional lavage. Microlavage should provide more accurate quantification of epithelial <b>lining</b> <b>fluid</b> volume and could be used in conjunction with conventional lavage, which is still required for an adequate harvest of alveolar cells...|$|R

The apparent volume of epithelial <b>lining</b> <b>fluid</b> recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage was determined by using urea as an endogenous marker. There was a significant relationship (r = 0. 75; P less than 0. 02) between roxithromycin levels in plasma and epithelial <b>lining</b> <b>fluid,</b> with a correlation whose slope suggested {{that the level of}} drug penetration into the <b>lining</b> <b>fluid</b> was 0. 2.

In this study the proteome and peptidome of the cephalic secretion was studied in parental and non-parental fish using capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry (CE-MS) and GeLC-MS/MS analyses. Multiple comparisons revealed 28 peptides were significantly different between males and parental males (PC-males), 126 between females and parental females (PC-females), 51 {{between males and females}} and 9 between PC-males and PC-females.

A total of 422 proteins were also identified and gene ontology analysis revealed 28 secreted extracellular proteins. From these, 2 hormones (prolactin and stanniocalcin) and 12 proteins associated to immunological processes (serotransferrin, α- 1 -antitrypsin homolog, apolipoprotein A-I, and others) were identified.

40|$|Apolipoprotein J (apoJ) is a sulfated {{secreted}} glycoprotein that exhibits ubiquitous expression, evolutionary conservation, {{and diverse}} tissue inducibility. It {{has been proposed}} to have roles in programmed cell death, sperm maturation, complement regulation, and lipid transport. To identify cell types that synthesize apoJ and to aid evaluation of its function, we screened mouse and human tissues by in situ hybridization. ApoJ was expressed at high levels {{in an array of}} specialized cell types of adult and fetal mouse tissues and in similar cell types of human tissues. Most of these cell types are highly secretory and form the cellular interfaces of many fluid compartments. This group includes epithelial boundary cells of the esophagus, biliary ducts, gallbladder, urinary bladder, ureter, kidney distal convoluted tubules, gastric glands, Brunner's glands, choroid plexus, ependyma, ocular ciliary body, endometrium, cervix, vagina, testis, epididymus, and visceral yolk sac.

40|$|Introduction: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the thermal injury fluid resuscitation protocols at intensive care units (ICUs) in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Materials and methods: A telephone questionnaire was designed to survey the fluid resuscitation protocols of ICUs at all hospitals with plastic/burn surgery departments in the British Isles in 2010. The feedback from the questionnaire was from the senior nurse in charge of the ICUs. Results: 32 / 64 (50 %) of these ICUs had provided care to burns patients. A 100 % response from these 32 units was obtained. 71. 4 % commence fluid resuscitation at 15 % total body surface area burn (TBSA), 21. 4 % at 20 % TBSA and 7. 1 % at 10 % TBSA in adults. The estimated resuscitation volume was most often calculated using the Parkland/Modified Parkland formula (87. 5 %) or the Muir and Barclay formula (12. 5 %). Interestingly, of the ICUs using formulae, two had recently moved from using the Muir and Barclay formula to Parkland formula and one had recently moved from using the Parkland formula to Muir and Barclay formula. Despite this, 37. 5 % of ICUs using a formula did not rigidly follow it exactly. The most commonly used resuscitation fluid was Ringer’s lactate solution (46. 9 %) and Human Albumin Solution was used in 12. 5 %. No ICU used red cell concentrate as a first <b>line</b> <b>fluid.</b> 18. 8 % used a central line. 40. 6 % ICUs considered changing the IV solution during resuscitation. 78. 1 % ICUs consider urine output to be the most important factor in modifying resuscitation volumes. 59. 4 % ICUs calculate a maintenance fluid rate after completion of resuscitation. The endpoint for resuscitation was at 24 h in 46. 9 % ICUs and at 36 h in 9. 4 %. 5 / 32 (16 %) felt their protocol gave too little and 6 / 32 (19 %) felt their protocol gave too much. 59. 3 % ICUs gave oral/enteral fluids by naso-gastric or naso-jejenal tubes. 21. 9 % felt that oral/enteral resuscitation worked. Exactly half of the units believed that the formula that they used provided approximately the right amount of fluid, with 25 % believing that it provided too much and 21. 9 % that it provided too little. Discussion and conclusion: There is substantial variation in the fluid resuscitation protocols for burns of ICUs in the British Isles. The different practices demonstrated in this survey may have important consequences as inadequate fluid resuscitation can limit perfusion to potentially recoverable burns, grafted tissue and body organs not directly injured...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Concentrations of glutathione, a {{ubiquitous}} tripeptide with immune enhancing and antioxidant properties, are {{decreased in}} the blood and lung epithelial <b>lining</b> <b>fluid</b> of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositive individuals. Since the lung {{is the most common}} site of infection in those who progress to AIDS it is rational to consider whether it is possible to safely augment glutathione levels in the epithelial <b>lining</b> <b>fluid</b> of HIV seropositive individuals, thus potentially improving local host defence. METHODS [...] Purified reduced glutathione was delivered by aerosol to HIV seropositive individuals (n = 14) and the glutathione levels in lung epithelial <b>lining</b> <b>fluid</b> were compared before and at one, two, and three hours after aerosol administration. RESULTS [...] Before treatment total glutathione concentrations in the epithelial <b>lining</b> <b>fluid</b> were approximately 60 % of controls. After three days of twice daily doses each of 600 mg reduced glutathione, total glutathione levels in the epithelial <b>lining</b> <b>fluid</b> increased and remained in the normal range for at least three hours after treatment. Strikingly, even though > 95 % of the glutathione in the aerosol was in its reduced form, the percentage of oxidised glutathione in epithelial <b>lining</b> <b>fluid</b> increased from 5 % before treatment to about 40 % three hours after treatment, probably reflecting the use of glutathione as an antioxidant in vivo. No adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS [...] It is feasible and safe to use aerosolised reduced glutathione to augment the deficient glutathione levels of the lower respiratory tract of HIV seropositive individuals.

MethodsIn 15 patients, epithelial <b>lining</b> <b>fluid</b> was collected in triplicate from subsegmental bronchi close to the pulmonary nodules and from contralateral lungs. Diagnosis was confirmed by transbronchial biopsy or surgery (non–small cell lung cancer, n = 11; benign or other lesions, n = 4). Total RNA was isolated from the samples and evaluated concerning quantity and quality. The complementary DNA was generated and analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for potential lung cancer associated genes like matrix metalloprotinase (MMP 9). ResultsTotal RNA of adequate amount (> 0. 8 μg) and sufficient quality was obtained in 13 (86 %) of the 15 patients. In patients with lung cancer, normalized MMP 9 gene expression levels in endobronchial <b>lining</b> <b>fluid</b> samples collected close to the lesions were in median 12 times higher than levels in the matching contralateral samples.

With the knowledge that VEGF can function to induce vascular leak, we hypothesized that to protect the lung from pulmonary edema, the VEGF produced in the lung must be compartmentalized from the pulmonary endothelium, and thus must be compartmentalized {{to the surface of}} the respiratory epithelium. Material and Methods: To assess this hypothesis, we quantified the levels of VEGF in human respiratory epithelial <b>lining</b> <b>fluid</b> recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage from normal individuals. Results: Strikingly, human respiratory epithelial <b>lining</b> <b>fluid</b> contains 11 � 5 ng/mL as quantified by ELISA, a 500 -fold greater concentration than plasma (22 � 10 pg/mL, p � 0. 0005).

40|$|The main aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} and understand the determinants that influence drug absorption across the lung epithelium by focusing on different formulations of ciprofloxacin as a potential inhaled treatment for respiratory tract infections. The transport of inhaled therapeutics follows a series of processes whereby following deposition, aerosol drug particles are wetted, dissolve and diffuse into the apical surface liquid for subsequent absorption across the lung epithelium. To mimic the bolus inhalation in vivo, the twin stage impinger was used in vitro to deposit formulations onto air interface Calu- 3 bronchial epithelial cells. In this thesis, the dissolution of ciprofloxacin in the epithelial <b>lining</b> <b>fluid</b> was influenced {{by a number of}} factors including drug crystalinity, timing and sequence of drug administration, salt selection, formulation properties, solubility and pH in the epithelial <b>lining</b> <b>fluid.</b> In general, the rate of the overall transport process was governed by the rate of particles dissolution/drug release into the apical <b>lining</b> <b>fluid</b> and subsequent permeability across the pulmonary epithelial cells. These studies have provided an insight into the different factors that could influence drug absorption and reinforce the potential of using in vitro cell culture models as a platform to elucidate the interactions and mechanisms of transepithelial transport, enabling the development of safe and effective inhaled therapeutics.
