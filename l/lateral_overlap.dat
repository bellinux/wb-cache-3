After entering the 21 st century, aerial photogrammetry technology has fully entered the digital age, and the quality of digital aerial photography results will directly affect the quality and accuracy of results of surveying and mapping. Therefore, it is necessary to inspect the quality of digital aerial photography results. In the process of digital aerial photography, flight quality directly affects the quality of the results.

Decorrelation of sequentially acquired ultrasound signals resulting from the deformation imposes a limitation on the precision (elastographic signal-to-noise ratio; SNRe) of estimating these deformations; this is presented as the lateral shear strain filter. In this paper, we explore the effect of a 2 -D-window-based strain estimation approach on the lateral shear strain filter and propose an extension of the 1 -D theoretical lateral shear strain filter to 2 -D. We compared the performance of the 2 -D approach in simulated ultrasound data and a tissue-mimicking phantom with that of the 2 -D lateral shear strain filter. In simulations, the 2 -D-window-based approach shows an effect in the axial direction similar to the 2 -D prediction. In simulations and experiments, increasing the window size in the lateral direction shows an increase in the maximum SNRe of the lateral shear strain filter. Increasing the <b>lateral</b> <b>overlap</b> has no effect on the estimation of lateral shear strain. These results were confirmed in the tissue-mimicking phantom experiments.

Method: The fractures were classified based on the age of the patient, unilateral/bilateral, location on the condyle, presence of displacement and dislocation, for those displaced, whether there was medial or <b>lateral</b> <b>overlap,</b> and features presented. Treatment done for each patient was documented. Both clinical and radiological assessments were done to ascertain the outcome of treatment. Result: 11 patients presented with 14 condyle fractures, 3 patients with bi lateral and 8 with unilateral condyle fractures out of which 5 cases were on the right side. Age range of patients was between 13 and 44 years with a mean (SD) of 25. 3 (10. 7) years. Nine (81. 8 %) of the patients were males and 2 (18. 2 %) were females. Eight (72. 7 %) of the patients with condyle fracture had associated fractures affecting other sites of the mandible while 3 (27. 3 %) patients had isolated condyle fractures. Intracapusular fractures recorded were 2 (14. 2 %), while extracapsular accounted for 12 (85. 8 %) cases.

40|$|A main {{parameter}} for {{the collision}} risk is the Passing Frequency. The collision risk model, originally developed by P. R. Reich for air routes uses besides other parameters the so-called probability of <b>lateral</b> <b>overlap</b> (Py). This parameter {{depends on the}} navigation behavior of aircraft. For estimating the collision risk due to loss of vertical separation a method is proposed which estimates directly the probability of occurances of horizontal overlaps. This method has the following advantages: 1. The estimated overlap frequencies are nearly independent {{of the behavior of}} aircraft concerning navigation on air routes. 2. The proposed method is suited for a system which determines automatically the overlap frequencies similar to a short term conflict probe. Using the proposed method overlap frequencies for northern and southern Germany were determined. For doing this radar data were available for one week separately for both parts of Germany. A main result of the study is that 88 % of the observed passing events are crossing events. But one has to consider the definition for crossings which was utilized. A great part of crossings occured on air routes possibly {{due to the fact that}} aircraft were not advised to fly accurately on centerlines. Concerning the collision risk the results are given in table 3. Only with MASPS certified aircraft the collision risk is well below the TLS in a future 1000 ft vertical seperation environment. This is also true for high density areas like the airspace around Frankfurt. The results of the study permit no clear answer about the necessity of using offsets when flying on air routes. It depends on navigation systems and procedures which will be used in the future. (orig.)

40|$|Abstract Laser {{additive}} manufacturing (LAM) is a near-net-shape production technique {{by which a}} part can be built up from 3 D CAD model data, without material removal. Recently, these production processes gained attention due to the spreading of polymer-based processes in private and commercial applications. However, due to the insufficient development of metal producing processes regarding design, process information and qualification, resistance on producing functional components with this technology is still present. To overcome this restriction further studies have to be undertaken. The present research proposes a parametric study of {{additive manufacturing}} of hot work tool steel, H 11. The selected LAM process is wire-based laser metal deposition (LMD-W).

3000|$|A MATLAB {{code was}} written to {{simulate}} a 7 -m-wide two-lane road of length 5, 000  m and four vehicle types namely HMVs, LMVs, 3 Ws and 2 Ws. As mentioned earlier, in CA models, {{the road is}} represented by a lattice of uniformly sized cells {{and the size of}} cells affects the computational time and accuracy of the model. Finer cell sizes result in higher accuracy as vehicular gaps and dimensions can be represented more accurately but it is believed that this also increases computational time as there are now more cells in lattice that needs to needs to be processed by computer at every time-step. However, authors believe that computational time is more dependent on the density of vehicles on road, number of lanes and length of road to be simulated, whereas cell size has less effect on computational time. Hence, it was decided to adopt a size that can accurately represent the smallest vehicular gap and dimension observed in study. Since, in mixed traffic, the space headway could be as little as 0.5  m during queues in jam conditions and 2 Ws are the smallest vehicles in the study with a maximum width of 0.7  m, a lattice with a periodic boundary condition consisting of 10, 000 cells of size 0.5  m ×  0.7  m was used for simulation. The open boundaries are usually not preferred as longer lattices are required for various simulation phases. Further, as the length of lattice increases, the [...] number of vehicles to be processed at each time-step also increases for a given density. This increases computational time and still does not guarantee a steady state before measurements. All road links were simulated using their traffic composition and densities per kilometer as input. Measurements were taken through a virtual detector of length 60  m in the middle of lattice to replicate 60  m camera trap used in field and then results were averaged at different occupancies. A total of 10 simulation runs were carried out with each run simulating for 3, 600  s using a resolution of 8 time-steps per second. Hence, there were a total 28, 800 (3, 600  ×  8) time-steps in each simulation run. For each simulation run, the first 800 time-steps were discarded as a warm-up to eliminate the initial noise. The simulated vehicular trajectories were created to obtain characteristics such as individual speeds, stream speeds, gaps, occupancies, proportion of a vehicle type in car-following or overtaking. Vehicles do not necessarily continue in the same lane, so in this study car-following does not only represent vehicles in perfect car-following, but also those having staggered car-following [22] with some degree of <b>lateral</b> <b>overlapping</b> (> 50 %) in the direction of travel as shown in Fig.  7. Since all eight roads had the similar geometry, results can be attributed to traffic flow characteristics.|$|R

The area is covered also at 60 % <b>lateral</b> <b>overlap.</b> 44 targeted ground control points {{with a standard deviation of}} the coordinate components of 1. 5 cm and better are available in the 210 used images. An automatic aerial triangulation with LPS has been made. Detailed analysis with the Hannover program for bundle block adjustment BLUH showed systematic image errors requiring an improvement of the UltraCam-specific additional parameters. Finally by bundle adjustment with self calibration a standard deviation of the horizontal check point coordinates of approximately 14 mm corresponding to 0. 6 GSD and in Z up to 26 mm corresponding to 1. 2 GSD has been reached for the check points measured in the average in 6 images. This extreme accuracy is limited by the identification and the accuracy of the ground control and check points. The TDI was able to compensate the very fast forward motion; no obvious reduced image quality in flight direction could be seen. Radiometric image quality for these high resolution images were also conducted by assessing the image quality in terms of edge analysis.

40|$|Acceleration is an {{important}} driving manoeuvre that has been modelled for decades as a critical element of the microscopic traffic simulation tools. The state-of-the art acceleration models have however primarily focused on lane based traffic. In lane based traffic, every driver has a single distinct lead vehicle {{in the front and}} the acceleration of the driver is typically modelled {{as a function of the}} relative speed, position and/or type of the corresponding leader. On the contrary, in a traffic stream with weak lane discipline, the subject driver may have multiple vehicles in the front. The subject driver is therefore subjected to multiple sources of stimulus for acceleration and reacts to the stimulus from the governing leader. However, only the applied accelerations are observed in the trajectory data, and the governing leader is unobserved or latent. The state-of-the-art models therefore cannot be directly applied to traffic streams with weak lane discipline. This prompts the current research where we present a latent leader acceleration model. The model has two components: a random utility based dynamic class membership model (latent leader component) and a class-specific acceleration model (acceleration component). The parameters of the model have been calibrated using detailed trajectory data collected from Dhaka, Bangladesh. Results indicate that the probability of a given front vehicle of being the governing leader can depend on the type of the lead vehicle and the extent of <b>lateral</b> <b>overlap</b> with the subject driver. The estimation results are compared against a simpler acceleration model (where the leader is determined deterministically) and a significant improvement in the goodness-of-fit is observed.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{influence}} of the roll-up of a wake on the benefits in induced drag and rolling moment experienced by a close formation of two elliptically loaded wings. The roll-up of the leading wake is computed in the Trefftz plane using a linear vorticity panel method. A smoothing parameter as well as a truncation of the vortex sheet in the highly rolled-up areas are introduced in order to stabilize the computations. The trailing wing is simply modeled as a lifting line, and its induced drag is computed thanks to a near-field analysis. The results are compared to computations using simple horseshoe-vortex methods, either with or without a viscous core. Maximum induced drag benefits comprised between 60 % and 70 % are observed for a <b>lateral</b> <b>overlap</b> of both wings of about 5 % to 10 % of the span. The maximum rolling moment is in average attained for 1. 5 % of the span less overlap. It is found that a horseshoe vortex with a viscous core of radius over semi-span ratio (2 r[c]) /b = 0. 12 modeled according to Burnham can account well for the effects of the roll-up of the wake on the benefits in induced drag that can be gained from formation flight. Actually, the difference between both results is mainly confined in a small region around the maximum and the relative error is generally low. Taking the vertical drift of the whole wake into account is not found to be beneficial to the agreement between the results around the maximum. In the case of the rolling moment, the predictions given by simple horseshoe vortex models do not agree very well with the predictions given by the rolled-up sheet model, the relative error between both predictions being very high in many areas. by Amandine Denis.

After equilibration at a suction pressure of 3. 2 kPa before and after desiccation, TEM observations showed large differences between abeidellite and both a low and high charge montmorillonite. Monolayers were rare; individual ayers were instead organized in particles with larger interparticle distances. This has implication for theories relating swelling pressures to interlayer distances or surface areas and implies the need for a geometrical pproach to the study of swelling in smectites. Location of isomorphous substitution i the tetrahedral sheet of smectites results in an increased <b>lateral</b> extension of <b>overlapping</b> layers.

40|$|The downstructure {{of viewing}} {{geologic}} maps, balanced and cross sections, and hanging-wall-sequence diagrams {{are applied to}} produce the first comprehensive synthesis of the structure below the willard thrust sheet. Development of the duplex beneath the Willard thrust may be explained with a 2 ̆ 2 piggyback 2 ̆ 2 thrust model where younger thrust slices form below and fold an older, overlying thrust sheet. Progressive failure of the footwall ramp of the Willard thrust sheet extended the sole thrust eastward and produced a duplex consisting of thrust slices (horses) which adhered to the overriding thrust sheet where it ramped from a lower sole thrust to an upper decollement horizon. The resulting structural culmination produced a distinct antiform in the Willard thrust sheet. The duplex is here named the Ogden duplex. Frontal folds (formed at ramps perpendicular to transport) and lateral folds (formed at ramps parallel to transport) mark the margin of Individual horses within the duplex. Folded thrusts, thrust-splay relationships, and <b>lateral</b> <b>overlap</b> of horses help determine the sequence of thrusting. The involvement of cratonic foreland basement rocks (Farmington Canyon Complex) in thrust slices within the Ogden duplex {{is similar to the}} Moine thrust belt in northern Scotland and pinpoints this area within zone III of Boyer and Elliott 2 ̆ 7 s (1982) model of a thrust system dominated by a major thrust sheet.

Semiquinone-bridged bis- 1, 2, 3 -dithiazolyl radicals (R = Cl, Ph, Me and the MeCN adduct of R = Cl) represent a new family of resonance stabilized neutral radical {{for use in the}} design of single-component conductive materials were prepared and fully characterized. In solid state these radicals remain as unassociated (monomers) in the solid state and typically form superimposed alternating π-stacks or slipped π-stacks, arranged in several different space groups. The predominate intermolecular interactions are S•••N′ and / or S•••O′ contacts, which increase the dimensionality from one dimensional π-stacked systems (i. e., poor <b>lateral</b> <b>overlap)</b> to two dimensional systems in the solid state. Thus the semiquinone-bridged bis-dithiazolyl radicals exhibit a significant decrease in activation energy (ca. 0. 1 – 0. 2 eV) and the conductivity is two to three orders of magnitude (ca. σ ≈ 1 E- 5 – 1 E- 2 S / cm) higher in comparison to the previously reported pyridine based systems. This high conductivity is attributed to the low on-site Coulomb repulsion energies (U) which were estimated from the solution cell potentials (EPC) obtained from CV measurements and improved bandwidth (W) from the S•••N′ and / or S•••O′ interactions. Furthermore, the all sulphur containing semiquinone-bridged bis-dithiazolyls have the lowest activation energies and the highest conductivity under ambient conditions compared with other all sulfur nitrogen based radicals known to date. 	The semiquinone-bridged bis-dithiazolyl (R = Cl) orderes as spin-canted antiferromagnets, TN = 8 K, and displayed large coercivity (80 Oe). The ZFC-FC measurement at low field (i. e., H = 100 Oe) established the phase transition temperatures and the spontaneous magnetization was used to estimate the spin canting angles (~ 0. 14 °). In the case of R = Ph, the antiparallel alignment of the ferromagnetic coupled chains leads to a spin-canted antiferromagnet (TN = 4. 5 K), which undergo a unique field induced spin flop transition. The MeCN solvated of R = Cl behaves as a simple paramagnet at room temperature with bulk antiferromagnetic interactions, but no observed magnetic ordering from 2 - 300 K...|$|E
30|$|Most {{major oil}} zones in the Daqing Oilfield {{have reached a}} later, high water cut stage, but oil {{recovery}} is still only approximately 35  %, and 50  % of reserves remain to be recovered. The remaining oil is primarily distributed {{at the edge of}} faults, in poor sand bodies, and in insufficiently injected and produced areas. Therefore, the edge of faults is a major target for remaining oil enrichment and potential tapping. Based on the dynamic change of production from development wells determined by the injection–recovery relationship at the edge of faults, we analyzed the control of structural features of faults on remaining oil enrichment at the edge. Our results show that the macroscopic structural features and their geometric relationship with sand bodies controlled remaining oil enrichment zones like the edges of NNE-striking faults, the footwalls of antithetic faults, the hard linkage segments (two faults had linked together with each other to form a bigger through-going fault), the tips of faults, and the oblique anticlines of soft linkages. Fault edges formed two types of forward micro-amplitude structures: (1) the tilted uplift of footwalls controlled by inverse fault sections and (2) the hanging-wall horizontal anticlines controlled by synthetic fault points. The remaining oil distribution was controlled by micro-amplitude structures. Consequently, such zones as the tilted uplift of the footwall of the NNW-striking antithetic faults with a fault throw larger than 40  m, the hard linkage segments, the tips of faults, and the oblique anticlines of soft linkage were favorable for tapping the remaining oil potential. Multi-target directional drilling was used for remaining oil development at fault edges. Reasonable fault spacing was determined on the basis of fault combinations and width of the shattered zone. Well core and log data revealed that the width of the shattered zone {{on the side of the}} fault core was less than 15  m in general; therefore, the distance from a fault to the development target should be larger than 15  m. Vertically segmented growth faults should take the separation of the <b>lateral</b> <b>overlap</b> of faults into account. Therefore, the safe distance of remaining oil well deployment at the fault edge should be larger than the sum of the width of shattered zone in faults and the separation of growth faults by vertical segmentation.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundWhen the infarct {{border zone}} is stimulated prematurely, a {{unidirectional}} block line (UBL) can form {{and lead to}} double-loop (figure-of-eight) reentrant ventricular tachycardia (VT) with a central isthmus. The isthmus is composed of an entrance, center, and exit. It was hypothesized that for certain stimulus site locations and coupling intervals, the UBL would coincide with the isthmus entrance boundary, where infarct border zone thickness changes from thin-to-thick in the travel direction of the premature stimulus wavefront. MethodA quantitative model was developed to describe how thin-to-thick changes in the border zone result in critically convex wavefront curvature leading to conduction block, which is dependent upon coupling interval. The model was tested in 12 retrospectively analyzed postinfarction canine experiments. Electrical activation was mapped for premature stimulation {{and for the first}} reentrant VT cycle. The relationship of functional conduction block forming during premature stimulation to functional block during reentrant VT was quantified. ResultsFor an appropriately placed stimulus, in accord with model predictions: (1) The UBL and reentrant VT isthmus <b>lateral</b> boundaries <b>overlapped</b> (error: 4. 8 ± 5. 7 mm). (2) The UBL leading edge coincided with the distal isthmus where the center-entrance boundary would be expected to occur. (3) The mean coupling interval was 164. 6 ± 11. 0 ms during premature stimulation and 190. 7 ± 20. 4 ms during the first reentrant VT cycle, in accord with model calculations, which resulted in critically convex wavefront curvature with functional conduction block, respectively, at the location of the isthmus entrance boundary and at the lateral isthmus edges. DiscussionReentrant VT onset following premature stimulation {{can be explained by the}} presence of critically convex wavefront curvature and unidirectional block at the isthmus entrance boundary when the premature stimulation interval is sufficiently short. The double-loop reentrant circuit pattern is a consequence of wavefront bifurcation around this UBL followed by coalescence, and then impulse propagation through the isthmus. The wavefront is blocked from propagating laterally away from the isthmus by sharp increases in border zone thickness, which results in critically convex wavefront curvature at VT cycle lengths...|$|R
40|$|Fli- 1 is an ETS-domain {{transcription}} factor whose locus is disrupted in Ewing's Sarcoma and F-MuLV induced erythroleukaemia. To {{gain a better}} understanding of its normal function, we have isolated the zebrafish homologue. Similarities with other vertebrates, in the amino acid sequence and DNA binding properties of Fli- 1 from zebrafish, suggest that its function has been conserved during vertebrate evolution. The initial expression of zebrafish fli- 1 in the posterior <b>lateral</b> mesoderm <b>overlaps</b> with that of gata 2 in a potential haemangioblast population which likely contains precursors of blood and endothelium. Subsequently, fli- 1 and gata 2 expression patterns diverge, with separate fli- 1 and gata 2 expression domains arising in the developing vasculature and in sites of blood formation respectively. Elsewhere in the embryo, fli- 1 is expressed in sites of vasculogenesis. The expression of fli- 1 was investigated in a number of zebrafish mutants, which affect the circulatory system. In cloche, endothelium is absent and blood is drastically reduced. In contrast to the blood and endothelial markers that have been studied previously, fli- 1 expression was initiated normally in cloche embryos, indicating that induction of fli- 1 is one of the earliest indicators of haemangioblast formation. Furthermore, although fli- 1 expression in the trunk was not maintained, the normal expression pattern in the anterior half of the embryo was retained. These anterior cells did not, however, condense to form blood vessels. These data indicate that cloche has previously unsuspected roles at multiple stages in the formation of the vasculature. Analysis of fli- 1 expression in midline patterning mutants floating head and squint, confirms a requirement for the notochord in the formation of the dorsal-aorta. The formation of endothelium in one-eyed pinhead, cyclops and squint embryos indicates a novel role for the endoderm in the formation of the axial vein. The phenotype of sonic-you mutants implies a likely role for Sonic Hedgehog in mediating these processes. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge on how {{an insect}} s {{behavior}} changes {{in response to}} chemical substances in the environment can ultimately {{contribute to the development}} of biologically harmless pest controls. One of the links between sensory processing systems in the brain and motoric output is thought to be the neurons mediating the pre-processed information from the brain to act on motor circuits in the ganglia of insects. In the present study, the noctuid moth Heliothis virescens was the insect of study, and the thoracic ganglion of in total 88 preparations was stained with fluorescent dye to systematically study the descending neurons mediating information out of their brains. Performing mass-staining of the thoracic ganglion have contributed to knowledge on the areas where these neurons originates or projects. Visualizing the stained neurons in a confocal microscope showed condensed staining of dendrites of descending neurons in the anterior-ventral part of the lateral protocerebrum and in the lateral accessory lobes. Knowing that processing of chemosensory information might result in activities of behavioral relevance, it was especially interesting to see whether projection neurons making up the olfactory axis in the <b>lateral</b> protocerebrum <b>overlapped</b> spatially with dendrites of descending neurons eventually terminating in motor systems in the thoracic ganglia. Double staining of both the antennal lobe and the thoracic ganglion were therefore performed in the same individual, in 31 preparations. Three dimensional reconstruction and registration of descending neurons into the digital standard brain atlas (SBA) of H. virescens supported the spatial position of descending neurons in the anterior-ventral part of the lateral protocerebrum. The SBA containing the descending neurons was visually compared to a separate SBA containing the olfactory axis in the lateral protocerebrum, indicating no or minimal spatial overlap between the olfactory axis and the dendrites of descending neurons. This highlights the need for a detailed examination to discover if sensory information can be transferred to motor systems via 3 rd order neurons local to the protocerebrum...|$|R
