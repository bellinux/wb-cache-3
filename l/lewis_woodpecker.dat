40|$|This Habitat Evaluation Procedure {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine baseline habitat units (HUs) on the Scotch Creek, Mineral Hill, Pogue Mountain, Chesaw and Tunk Valley Habitat Areas (collectively known as the Scotch Creek Wildlife Area) in Okanogan County, Sagebrush Flat and the Dormaler property in Douglas County, and the Berg Brothers ranch located in Okanogan County within the Colville Reservation. A HEP team comprised of individuals from the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (Appendix A) conducted baseline habitat surveys using the following HEP evaluation species: mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), sharp-tailed grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus), pygmy rabbit (Brachylagus idahoensis), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginiana), mink (Mustela vison), Canada goose (Branta canadensis), downy woodpecker (Picoides pubescens), <b>Lewis</b> <b>woodpecker</b> (Melanerpes lewis), and Yellow warbler (Dendroica petechia). Results of the HEP analysis are listed below. General ratings (poor, marginal, fair, etc.,) are described in Appendix B. Mule deer habitat was marginal lacking diversity and quantify of suitable browse species. Sharp-tailed grouse habitat was marginal lacking residual nesting cover and suitable winter habitat Pygmy rabbit habitat was in fair condition except for the Dormaier property which was rated marginal due to excessive shrub canopy closure at some sites. This report is an analysis of baseline habitat conditions on mitigation project lands and provides estimated habitat units for mitigation crediting purposes. In addition, information from this document could be used by wildlife habitat managers to develop management strategies for specific project sites...|$|E
40|$|CALIFORNIA HOUSE FINCH Carpodacus mexicanus frontalis: Depredations. In California the linnet is an {{abundant}} resident throughout the State wherever {{food and water}} are available. It is most numerous on the valley floors and in the foothills where man 2 ̆ 7 s development has created an extensive favorable habitat. The linnet is primarily a seed eater and before the introduction of domestic fruits into California probably lived largely on weed seeds. Linnets attack the ripening fruit of the apricot, cherry, peach, pear, nectarine, plum, prune, avocado, grape, apple, fig, strawberry, blackberry, raspberry and many others. They disbud almond, apricot, pear, peach, plum, prune and nectarine. They also attack milo maize, sunflower, lettuce seed, broccoli seed, flax seed, miscellaneous vegetable and flower seeds, ornamental fruits and berries and tomato plantlets. HORNED IARKS Otocoris alpestris, subspecies: Depredations. In certain parts of California the horned lark is a serious crop destroyer. The damage occurs mostly in the interior valleys from Sacramento south to the Imperial Valley and along the coastal strip from San Francisco south to San Diego. Horned larks are given great opportunity for damage by the widespread abundance of cultivated products attractive to them. Among the crops severely damaged are plantlets of lettuce, carrots, beets, spinach, turnips, peas, beans, sugar beets, alfalfa, cantaloupes, watermelons, tomatoes and lettuce. Flower plantlets of any variety in commercial seed plantings are frequently devoured. Damage by horned larks usually begins after the first plants break through {{the surface of the}} soil and it may continue until the plants reach a height of several inches. CROWNED SEHRROWS Zonotrichia species and subspecies: Depredations. Direct opposites as to preference of habitat to the horned larks, crowned sparrows are birds of deep brush, river bottom jungles, dense weed fields, fence rows, brush piles or rubbish heaps. The dense hedges and thick plantings of shrubbery commonly found about many rural and suburban homes are much to their liking. Crop depredations in California by crowned sparrows can be laid to three subspecies—Gambel 2 ̆ 7 s, Nuttall 2 ̆ 7 s and Golden Crown. Due to its very wide range in the State and to the immense numbers which concentrate here, Gambel 2 ̆ 7 s sparrow must be considered by far the most important. WOODPECKERS: Depredations. In addition to the pecking of holes in buildings and poles, the California woodpecker frequently becomes a serious pest about almond or walnut orchards. The <b>Lewis</b> <b>woodpecker</b> has occasionally caused some damage to apples in certain areas of California...|$|E
40|$|<b>Lewis’s</b> <b>Woodpeckers</b> (Melanerpes <b>lewis)</b> are Threatened in Canada {{and rely}} on {{pre-existing}} cavities for nesting. I studied how cavity density, competition, and predators influence <b>Lewis’s</b> <b>Woodpecker</b> breeding performance across three habitats in British Columbia, and investigated the broad-scale patterns of nest tree persistence and reuse over time. I found that <b>Lewis’s</b> <b>Woodpecker</b> breeding performance was high in riparian cottonwood habitat, moderate in live pine, and lowest in crown-burned pine habitat. Cavity density explained habitat-based breeding performance. Nest tree persistence was generally high, but declined over time, and while nest tree reuse varied dramatically across years, there was no consistent temporal pattern. Our results suggest that 1) resource managers should use regionally-specific data for managing <b>Lewis’s</b> <b>Woodpecker</b> populations, and 2) cavities may be a limiting factor for the recovery of <b>Lewis’s</b> <b>Woodpecker</b> populations in Canada, particularly in regions where nest tree persistence is lower and may not support recruitment...|$|R
30|$|<b>Lewis’s</b> <b>woodpecker</b> is a patchily {{distributed}} {{but often}} locally abundant species that nests primarily in ponderosa pine and cottonwood (Populus spp.) riparian forests throughout the western United States (Tobalske 1997). The breeding distribution of <b>Lewis’s</b> <b>woodpecker</b> closely follows {{the range of}} ponderosa pine, suggesting that this species may have evolved in ponderosa pine systems (Saab and Vierling 2001). Unlike most woodpeckers that bore for bark- and wood-dwelling insects, <b>Lewis’s</b> <b>woodpecker</b> is an aerial forager that requires open habitats for aerial maneuvers involved in flycatching.|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the use of}} snag stands by seven species of cavity-nesting birds from 1994 - 1998. Selection of snags was studied in logged and unlogged burned forests at two spatial scales: microhabitat (local vegetation characteristics) and landscape (composition and patterning of surrounding vegetation types). We modeled nest occurrence at the landscape scale by using Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery. At both spatial scales, we observed a continuum in habitat use with the extremes represented by black-backed and <b>Lewis’s</b> <b>woodpeckers.</b> A range of habitat conditions characteristic of black-backed and <b>Lewis’s</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> would likely incorporate habitat features necessary for nest occurrence of other members in the cavitynesting bird community...|$|R
50|$|<b>Lewis's</b> <b>woodpecker</b> {{engages in}} some rather un-woodpecker-like {{behavior}} in its gregarious feeding habits. Although it does forage for insects by boring into trees with its chisel-like bill, the bird also catches insects {{in the air}} during flight, (typical insect hawking), a habit {{that only a few}} other woodpeckers, such as the Acorn woodpecker, the red-headed woodpecker and the northern flicker, engage in. <b>Lewis's</b> <b>woodpecker</b> also feeds on berries and nuts, and will even shell and store nuts in cracks and holes in wood to store until winter. It will also feed at flat, open bird feeders where it might act aggressively toward other birds.|$|R
25|$|These {{areas of}} {{relatively}} similar climate have many distinctive native {{plants and animals}} in common, such as ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), prickly pear cactus (Opuntia fragilis in this case), rattlesnakes, black widow spiders and <b>Lewis's</b> <b>woodpecker.</b>|$|R
30|$|Saab et al. (2002) {{examined}} {{stand and}} landscape conditions selected by birds in burned forests at two spatial scales in southeastern Idaho. The nests of two woodpecker species, the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) and the <b>Lewis’s</b> <b>woodpecker</b> (Melanerpes <b>lewis),</b> {{were found at}} two ends {{of a range of}} habitat conditions. Compared to random sites and other cavity nesting bird species, <b>Lewis’s</b> <b>woodpecker</b> nests were found in stands that had relatively low snag density with relatively large diameter snags. The black-backed woodpecker tended to occur in stands with a high density of relatively small diameter snags. Saab et al. (2002) related the relative occurrence of these two species to food preferences. Black-backed woodpeckers forage on bark beetles (Scolyitidae) and wood-boring beetles (Cerambycidae) that may be abundant following fire. <b>Lewis’s</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> are primarily aerial flycatchers during the breeding season that sally from perches in relatively open conditions. First-order fire-effect models that could predict tree mortality according to stand crown closure characteristics could be used to predict post-fire snag densities that would serve as an index for woodpecker habitat suitability over a 3 yr to 5 yr post-fire period.|$|R

30|$|This {{species is}} {{considered}} a burn specialist due to its relatively high nesting success and high breeding densities in burned ponderosa pine forests (Saab and Vierling 2001, Gentry and Vierling 2007, Saab et al. 2007). Conditions created after moderate- to high-severity crown fires in ponderosa pine forests are known to provide ideal breeding habitat throughout the range of <b>Lewis’s</b> <b>woodpecker</b> {{for at least a}} dozen years following fire (e.g., Raphael and White 1984, Haggard and Gaines 2001, Bock and Block 2005, Saab et al. 2007). Burned ponderosa pine forests likely provide a suitable breeding and foraging environment for <b>Lewis’s</b> <b>woodpecker</b> because of the high snag abundance therein, and because of the relatively open canopy that allows for shrub development and associated arthropod prey (Bock 1970), good visibility, and perch sites for foraging, and space for foraging maneuvers (Saab and Vierling 2001).|$|R

50|$|<b>Lewis's</b> <b>woodpecker</b> is locally common, {{dwelling}} {{mostly in}} open pine woodlands, {{and other areas}} with scattered trees and snags. Unlike other American woodpeckers, it enjoys sitting in the open as opposed to sitting in heavy tree cover.

It has been seen in three Midwestern states: Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the largest}} species of American <b>woodpeckers,</b> <b>Lewis's</b> <b>woodpecker</b> can measure up to 10 - 11 inches in length. It is mainly reddish-breasted, blackish-green in color with a black rump. It has a gray collar and upper breast, with a pinkish belly, and a red face.

30|$|The {{death of}} large ponderosa pine trees, in particular, {{appears to be}} a {{necessary}} requisite for <b>Lewis’s</b> <b>woodpecker.</b> This species differs from other woodpeckers in that it lacks several anatomical adaptations that facilitate wood excavation (i.e., fused vertebrae, thickened skull; Goodge 1972). Perhaps due to these characteristics, it nests primarily in snags or soft-wooded trees, such as heavily decayed conifers and cottonwoods. Ponderosa pines are more readily excavated than other conifer tree species because they contain a relatively thick layer of sapwood with a hardened exterior shell. Ponderosa pine is also more easily excavated by cavity-nesting birds if the sapwood has decayed (Bull et al. 1997). Importantly, the sapwood of fire-killed ponderosa pine begins to soften in the third year after death, allowing for easier cavity excavation after that time. Thus, nesting densities of <b>Lewis’s</b> <b>woodpecker</b> tend to increase from 5 yr to 12 yr after fire (Saab et al. 2007). Taken together, the distribution and ecology of all of these bird species suggest that high-severity fires were prehistorically more common across the variety of ponderosa pine systems than what conventional tree-ring records from the past several hundred years have led us to believe (see also Schoennagel et al. 2004, Baker et al. 2007, Sherriff and Veblen 2007).|$|R
