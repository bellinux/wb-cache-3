50|$|A basic {{acceptance}} {{of the meaning of}} a specific text tends to occur when a group of readers have a <b>shared</b> cultural <b>background</b> and interpret the text in similar ways. It is likely that the <b>less</b> <b>shared</b> heritage a reader has with the artist, the less he or she will be able to recognise the artist's intended meaning, and it follows that if two readers have vastly different cultural and personal experiences, their reading of a text will vary greatly. Umberto Eco coined the term aberrant decoding to describe the case when the reader's interpretation differs from what the artist intended.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role and}} estimates the economic value of social networks tied to academic institutions in the venture capital industry. I show that having a <b>shared</b> acad-emic <b>background</b> {{increases the likelihood of}} matching between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists by 57 %. Similarly, a <b>shared</b> academic <b>background</b> increases the likelihood of matching between di¤erent venture capitalists by 42 % when they syndicate portfolio company investments. Finally, a <b>shared</b> academic <b>background</b> improves portfolio com-pany performance. For example, when an entrepreneur and a venture capitalist attended the same Top 3 academic institution, the likelihood that the investment will result in an initial public o¤ering or acquisition increases by 42 %. This is the incremental e¤ect of having attended the same Top 3 academic institution. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence that <b>shared</b> academic <b>backgrounds</b> help reduce information gaps in the venture capital industry...|$|R

5000|$|Reception theory {{emphasizes}} the reader's reception {{of a literary}} text or media. This approach to textual analysis focuses on the scope for negotiation and opposition {{on the part of}} the audience. This means that a [...] "text"—be it a book, movie, or other creative work—is not simply passively accepted by the audience, but that the reader / viewer interprets the meanings of the text based on their individual cultural background and life experiences. In essence, the meaning of a text is not inherent within the text itself, but is created within the relationship between the text and the reader. A basic acceptance of the meaning of a specific text tends to occur when a group of readers have a <b>shared</b> cultural <b>background</b> and interpret the text in similar ways. It is likely that the <b>less</b> <b>shared</b> heritage a reader has with the artist, the less he/she will be able to recognize the artist's intended meaning, and it follows that if two readers have vastly different cultural and personal experiences, their reading of a text will vary greatly.|$|R

METHOD: For this purpose, we studied a group of 6 SD patients {{and a group of}} 12 matched controls using a sentence verification task in which we orthogonally manipulated feature sharedness (more vs. <b>less</b> <b>shared)</b> and concept level (basic level vs. superordinate). RESULTS: Main results showed that the superordinate advantage in SD patients was observed for more shared features but not for <b>less</b> <b>shared</b> features (p <. 05, η(p) 2 =. 36). CONCLUSION: These results directly support the role of feature sharedness in explaining the hierarchical organization of semantic knowledge and the specific to general pattern of knowledge deterioration in SD in particular...|$|R

40|$|This study compares between {{firms in}} the US mature market economy and in the Polish {{transitional}} economy. The study found that Poland's past as a planned economy may continue to hinder interdepartmental connectedness and act {{as an obstacle to}} firms in adopting a market orientation. According to the study, for Polish firms, there is <b>less</b> <b>shared</b> information and cooperation across departments, and <b>less</b> <b>shared</b> responsibility for departmental tasks, compared to US firms. The status of marketing in Poland remains that of a junior department, subordinate to influences from functional areas such as finance and accounting, which directed production in the former planned economy. The study supports the hypothesis that Polish firms have lower interdepartmental connectedness than US firms and finds strong support for the relationship between interdepartmental connectedness and firm performance.
