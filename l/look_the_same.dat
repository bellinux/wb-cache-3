The {{portion of the}} user capacity which is free from user data (either already TRIMed or never written in the first place) will <b>look</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as over-provisioning space (until the user saves new data to the SSD). If the user saves data consuming {{only half of the}} total user capacity of the drive, {{the other half of the}} user capacity will look like additional over-provisioning (as long as the TRIM command is supported in the system).|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{conceptual}} clarity of this Feynman approach to QED, almost no early textbooks follow {{him in their}} presentation. When performing calculations {{it is much easier}} to work with the Fourier transforms of the propagators. Experimental tests of quantum electrodynamics are typically scattering experiments. In scattering theory, particles' momenta rather than their positions are considered, and it is convenient to think of particles as being created or annihilated when they interact. Feynman diagrams then <b>look</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> but the lines have different interpretations. The electron line represents an electron with a given energy and momentum, with a similar interpretation of the photon line. A vertex diagram represents the annihilation of one electron and the creation of another together with the absorption or creation of a photon, each having specified energies and momenta.|$|E

5|$|In each level, {{the player}} may come across one other player {{temporarily}} connected to their game. When players approach each other they charge one another's scarves. They cannot {{communicate with each}} other beyond patterns of singing. Players can help each other by activating strips of cloth or showing paths, but cannot hinder each other and are not necessary for completing any level. When two players finish a section {{at the same time they}} remain together into the next one; otherwise they are connected to new players when they move on. While all of the figures generally <b>look</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> without distinguishing characteristics, individual players can be told apart by unique symbols which are shown floating in the air when they sing and are displayed on their robes at all times. The entire game takes about two to three hours to complete.|$|E

25|$|Using a flag unconventionally, such as hanging it {{upside down}} or reversed, may be {{regarded}} as desecration. Flying a flag at half-mast is considered desecration in Saudi Arabia.

Moreover, some flags (such as the flag of Austria) when hung upside down and/or reversed <b>look</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> because they are vertically and/or horizontally symmetrical.|$|E

Thredson believes Kit could not function in society while secretly being married to a black woman. The killer skinned all of his victims, even Alma, so all would <b>look</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> in death.

25|$|Any {{principle}} of relativity prescribes a symmetry in natural law: that is, the laws must <b>look</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> to one observer {{as they do}} to another. According to a theoretical result called Noether's theorem, any such symmetry will also imply a conservation law alongside. For example, if two observers at different times see the same laws, then a quantity called energy will be conserved. In this light, relativity principles make testable predictions about how nature behaves, and are not just statements about how scientists should write laws.|$|E
25|$|During filming, {{considerable}} publicity {{was given}} to health-conscious Gloria Swanson's youthful appearance, which made her <b>look</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> age as Holden. Wilder insisted that the age difference between the characters be delineated, and instructed makeup supervisor Wally Westmore to make Swanson look older. Swanson argued that a woman of Norma Desmond's age, with her considerable wealth and devotion to self, would not necessarily look old, and suggested Holden {{be made up to}} appear younger. Wilder agreed, and Westmore was assigned this task, which allowed Swanson to portray Norma Desmond as more glamorous a figure than Wilder had originally imagined.|$|E

25|$|A 2-story {{building}} with a new cafeteria was planned {{on the site of}} the other 1936 addition. Students were expected to move in by Fall 2004 and the construction costs were anticipated at $6.8 to $7.3 million. The $7.9 million cost of the project was $1.2 million more than expected. Work began in October 2003 and students were to move in by January 2005. The existing building was designed to <b>look</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> on the outside with a mostly new interior and a 25,000-square-foot addition. The addition was later increased to 37,000 square feet, with an exterior appearance matching the 1925 building.|$|E
25|$|For instance, {{breast cancer}} cells <b>look</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{whether they are}} found in the breast or have spread {{to another part of the}} body. So, if a tissue sample taken from a tumor in the lung {{contains}} cells that look like breast cells, the doctor determines that the lung tumor is a secondary tumor. Still, the determination of the primary tumor can often be very difficult, and the pathologist may have to use several adjuvant techniques, such as immunohistochemistry, FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization), and others. Despite the use of techniques, in some cases the primary tumor remains unidentified.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes the {{appearance}} of floaters has to be attributed to dark specks in the tear film of the eye. Technically, these are not floaters, but they do <b>look</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{from the viewpoint of}} the patient. Persons with blepharitis or a dysfunctional meibomian gland are especially prone to this cause, but ocular allergies can also cause the problem. To differentiate between material in the vitreous humour of the eye and debris in the tear film, one can look at the effect of blinking: debris in the tear film will move quickly with a blink, while floaters are largely unresponsive to it. Tear film debris is diagnosed by eliminating the possibility of true floaters and macular degeneration.|$|E
