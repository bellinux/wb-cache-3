5|$|In a medium, light {{usually does}} not {{propagate}} {{at a speed}} equal to c; further, different types of <b>light</b> <b>wave</b> will travel at different speeds. The speed at which the individual crests and troughs of a plane wave (a wave filling the whole space, with only one frequency) propagate is called the phase velocityvp. An actual physical signal with a finite extent (a pulse of light) travels at a different speed. The largest part of the pulse travels at the group velocityvg, and its earliest part travels at the front velocityvf.|$|E
5|$|In most {{theories}} up to {{the eighteenth}} century, light was pictured as being made up of particles. Since particle models cannot easily account for the refraction, diffraction and birefringence of <b>light,</b> <b>wave</b> theories of light were proposed by René Descartes (1637), Robert Hooke (1665), and Christiaan Huygens (1678); however, particle models remained dominant, chiefly due {{to the influence of}} Isaac Newton. In the early nineteenth century, Thomas Young and August Fresnel clearly demonstrated the interference and diffraction of light and by 1850 wave models were generally accepted. In 1865, James Clerk Maxwell's prediction that light was an electromagnetic wave—which was confirmed experimentally in 1888 by Heinrich Hertz's detection of radio waves—seemed to be the final blow to particle models of light.|$|E
5|$|Since the Maxwell {{theory of}} light allows for all {{possible}} energies of electromagnetic radiation, most physicists assumed initially {{that the energy}} quantization resulted from some unknown constraint on the matter that absorbs or emits the radiation. In 1905, Einstein {{was the first to}} propose that energy quantization was a property of electromagnetic radiation itself. Although he accepted the validity of Maxwell's theory, Einstein pointed out that many anomalous experiments could be explained if the energy of a Maxwellian <b>light</b> <b>wave</b> were localized into point-like quanta that move independently of one another, even if the wave itself is spread continuously over space. In 1909 and 1916, Einstein showed that, if Planck's law of black-body radiation is accepted, the energy quanta must also carry momentum , making them full-fledged particles. This photon momentum was observed experimentally by Arthur Compton, for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1927. The pivotal question was then: how to unify Maxwell's wave theory of light with its experimentally observed particle nature? The answer to this question occupied Albert Einstein {{for the rest of his}} life, and was solved in quantum electrodynamics and its successor, the Standard Model (see Second quantization and The photon as a gauge boson, below).|$|E

50|$|If {{the object}} is transparent, then the <b>light</b> <b>waves</b> are passed on to {{neighboring}} atoms through {{the bulk of the}} material and re-emitted {{on the opposite side of}} the object. Such frequencies of <b>light</b> <b>waves</b> are said to be transmitted.|$|R
5|$|Light that {{travels through}} {{transparent}} matter does so {{at a lower}} speed than c, {{the speed of light}} in a vacuum. For example, photons engage in so many collisions on the way from the core of the sun that radiant energy can take about a million years to reach the surface; however, once in open space, a photon takes only 8.3 minutes to reach Earth. The factor by which the speed is decreased is called the refractive index of the material. In a classical wave picture, the slowing {{can be explained by the}} light inducing electric polarization in the matter, the polarized matter radiating new light, and that new light interfering with the original <b>light</b> <b>wave</b> to form a delayed wave. In a particle picture, the slowing can instead be described as a blending of the photon with quantum excitations of the matter to produce quasi-particles known as polariton (other quasi-particles are phonons and excitons); this polariton has a nonzero effective mass, which means that it cannot travel at c. Light of different frequencies may travel through matter at different speeds; this is called dispersion (not to be confused with scattering). In some cases, it can result in extremely slow speeds of light in matter. The effects of photon interactions with other quasi-particles may be observed directly in Raman scattering and Brillouin scattering.|$|E
25|$|More {{rigorous}} models, {{involving the}} modelling of both electric and magnetic {{fields of the}} <b>light</b> <b>wave,</b> are required when dealing with the detailed interaction of light with materials where the interaction depends on their electric and magnetic properties. For instance, the behaviour of a <b>light</b> <b>wave</b> interacting with a metal surface {{is quite different from}} what happens when it interacts with a dielectric material. A vector model must also be used to model polarised light.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, Snell's law can {{be derived}} using {{interference}} of all possible paths of <b>light</b> <b>wave</b> from source to observer—it results in destructive interference everywhere except extrema of phase (where interference is constructive)—which become actual paths.|$|E

25|$|Many {{simplified}} approximations {{are available}} for analysing and designing optical systems. Most of these use a single scalar quantity to represent the electric field of the <b>light</b> <b>wave,</b> rather than using a vector model with orthogonal electric and magnetic vectors.|$|E
25|$|The speed, wavelength, and {{frequency}} of a gravitational wave are related by the equation c = λ f, just like the equation for a <b>light</b> <b>wave.</b> For example, the animations shown here oscillate roughly once every two seconds.

25|$|A {{waveplate}} or retarder is {{an optical}} device that alters the polarization state of a <b>light</b> <b>wave</b> travelling through it. Two common types of waveplates are the half-wave plate, which shifts the polarization direction of linearly polarized light, and the quarter-wave plate, which converts linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light and vice versa. A quarter-wave plate {{can be used}} to produce elliptical polarization as well.|$|E

25|$|The {{selective}} absorption of infrared (IR) light {{by a particular}} material occurs because the selected frequency of the <b>light</b> <b>wave</b> matches the frequency (or an integer multiple of the frequency) at which the particles of that material vibrate. Since different atoms and molecules have different natural frequencies of vibration, they will selectively absorb different frequencies (or portions of the spectrum) of infrared (IR) light.|$|E
25|$|In the leftmost figure above, the x and y {{components}} of the <b>light</b> <b>wave</b> are in phase. In this case, the ratio of their strengths is constant, so {{the direction of the}} electric vector (the vector sum of these two components) is constant. Since the tip of the vector traces out a single line in the plane, this special case is called linear polarization. The direction of this line depends on the relative amplitudes of the two components.|$|E
25|$|A {{waveplate}} {{works by}} shifting the phase between two perpendicular polarization {{components of the}} <b>light</b> <b>wave.</b> A typical waveplate is simply a birefringent crystal with a carefully chosen orientation and thickness. The crystal is cut into a plate, with {{the orientation of the}} cut chosen so that the optic axis of the crystal is parallel to the surfaces of the plate. This results in two axes in the plane of the cut: the ordinary axis, with index of refraction no, and the extraordinary axis, with index of refraction ne. The ordinary axis is perpendicular to the optic axis. The extraordinary axis is parallel to the optic axis. For a <b>light</b> <b>wave</b> normally incident upon the plate, polarization component along the ordinary axis travels through the crystal with a speed vo = c/no, while the polarization component along the extraordinary axis travels with a speed ve = c/ne. This leads to a phase difference between the two components as they exit the crystal. When ne< no, as in calcite, the extraordinary axis is called the fast axis and the ordinary axis is called the slow axis. For nenbsp&> no the situation is reversed.|$|E

25|$|The {{design of}} any {{optically}} transparent device requires {{the selection of}} materials based upon knowledge of its properties and limitations. The Lattice absorption characteristics observed at the lower frequency regions (mid IR to far-infrared wavelength range) define the long-wavelength transparency limit of the material. They {{are the result of}} the interactive coupling between the motions of thermally induced vibrations of the constituent atoms and molecules of the solid lattice and the incident <b>light</b> <b>wave</b> radiation. Hence, all materials are bounded by limiting regions of absorption caused by atomic and molecular vibrations (bond-stretching)in the far-infrared (>10µm).|$|E
25|$|Waveplates are {{constructed}} {{out of a}} birefringent material (such as quartz or mica), for which the index of refraction is different for different orientations of light passing through it. The behavior of a waveplate (that is, {{whether it is a}} half-wave plate, a quarter-wave plate, etc.) depends on the thickness of the crystal, the wavelength of light, and the variation of the index of refraction. By appropriate choice of the relationship between these parameters, it is possible to introduce a controlled phase shift between the two polarization components of a <b>light</b> <b>wave,</b> thereby altering its polarization.|$|E
25|$|In the {{photoelectric}} effect, it {{was observed}} that shining a light on certain metals would lead to an electric current in a circuit. Presumably, the light was knocking electrons out of the metal, causing current to flow. However, using the case of potassium as an example, it was also observed that while a dim blue light was enough to cause a current, even the strongest, brightest red light available with the technology of the time caused no current at all. According to the classical theory of light and matter, the strength or amplitude of a <b>light</b> <b>wave</b> was in proportion to its brightness: a bright light should have been easily strong enough to create a large current. Yet, oddly, this was not so.|$|E

25|$|Diffraction {{refers to}} various {{phenomena}} that occur when a wave encounters an obstacle or a slit. It {{is defined as}} the bending of light around the corners of an obstacle or aperture into the region of geometrical shadow of the obstacle. In classical physics, the diffraction phenomenon is described as the interference of waves according to the Huygens–Fresnel principle. These characteristic behaviors are exhibited when a wave encounters an obstacle or a slit that is comparable in size to its wavelength. Similar effects occur when a <b>light</b> <b>wave</b> travels through a medium with a varying refractive index, or when a sound wave travels through a medium with varying acoustic impedance. Diffraction occurs with all waves, including sound waves, water waves, and electromagnetic waves such as visible light, X-rays and radio waves.|$|E
25|$|For {{cavities}} {{much larger}} than the wavelength of the light they contain, cavities with very high Q factors have already been realized (~125,000,000). However, high Q cavities on the order of {{the same size as the}} optical wavelength have been difficult to produce due to the inverse relationship between radiation losses and cavity size. When dealing with a cavity {{much larger than}} the optical wavelength, it is simple to design interfaces such that light ray paths fulfill total internal reflection conditions or Bragg reflection conditions. For light confined within much smaller cavities near the size of the optical wavelength, deviations from ray optics approximations become severe and it becomes infeasible, if not impossible to design a cavity which fulfills optimum reflection conditions for all three spatial components of the propagating <b>light</b> <b>wave</b> vectors.|$|E
