40|$|The {{lubrication}} {{theory is}} mostly {{concerned with the}} behavior of a <b>lubricant</b> <b>flowing</b> through a narrow gap. Motivated by the experimental findings from the tribology literature, we take the lubricant to be micropolar fluid and study its behavior in a thin domain with rough boundary. Instead of considering (commonly used) simple zero boundary condition, we impose physically relevant (nonzero) boundary condition for microrotation and perform asymptotic analysis of the corresponding 3 D boundary value problem. We formally derive a simplified mathematical model acknowledging the roughness-induced effects and the effects of the nonzero boundary conditions on the macroscopic flow. Using the obtained asymptotic model, we study numerically the influence of the specific rugosity profile on the performance of a linear slider bearing. The numerical results clearly indicate that the use of the rough surfaces may contribute to enhance the mechanical performance of such device...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical investigation of microscopic lubricant {{flows from the}} cavities to the plateaus of the surface roughness of metal sheets during forming processes. This phenomenon, called micro-plastohydrodynamic lubrication, was observed experimentally in various situations such as compression sliding tests, strip drawing and cold rolling. It leads to local friction drop and wear reduction. It is therefore critical to achieve {{a good understanding of}} this phenomenon. As to move towards that goal, a multiscale fluid–structure interaction model is developed to model lubricant flows at the microscopic scale. These simulations are made possible through the use of the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formalism. In this paper, this methodology is used to study plane strip drawing. The numerical model is able to predict the onset of lubricant escape and the amount of <b>lubricant</b> <b>flowing</b> on the plateaus.

40|$|Most of {{physical}} and engineering problems are described by mathematical models that involves partial differential equations PDE's. Because {{of the structure of}} materials involved in this problems, some PDE's presents rapidly oscillating coeffcients that makes them not easy to solve even numerically. Homogenization a technique used to transform this type of problems in ano- ther problems easily solvable and that present a solution which is very close to solution from original problem. Since the fifties a very rapid progress in the development of numerical me- thods has taken place within the engineering sciences in cooperation with numerical analysts and mathematicians. In the light of this, homogeniza- tion theory provides a good example of modern mathematics development by mathematicians aware of recent numerical methods and with an interest in questions in fields where classical mathematical methods have not been successful in formulating problems in a form that suits existing numerical techniques. In this thesis we consider homogenization theory, and the way it can be applied to solve problems from Tribology. This Master thesis is composed by five chapters: in the first chapter we make an brief introduction of homogenization theory. The second chapter we motivate the Reynolds equations by using notions of fluid motion. In the chapter three we present the homogenization procedure for the case where the fluid is incomprehensible considering the presence and absence of surface roughness effect. Numerical methods to compare and show the behavior of our solutions and compare the solutions from real problem with the solu- tions from the homogenized problem are developed in chapter four. In the chapter five we motivate the expression which describe the friction force and we evaluate the effect of hydrodynamic pressure built from <b>lubricant</b> <b>flowing</b> between two thin surfaces into the friction force.

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} effective slip arising from pressure-driven flow through a slit channel bounded by lubricant-impregnated grooved surfaces. The problem for flow over longitudinal grooves is solved analytically using {{the methods of}} domain decomposition and eigenfunction expansion, while that for flow over transverse grooves is solved numerically using the front tracking method. It is found that the effective slip length and the <b>lubricant</b> <b>flow</b> rate can depend strongly on the geometry of the microstructure, the direction of <b>flow,</b> and the <b>lubricant</b> viscosity. In particular, the effective slip can be effectively enhanced by increasing the thickness of a lubricating film atop the ribs. Under the same conditions, a flow that {{is parallel to the}} lubricant-impregnated grooves will have a larger effective slip, but also a larger <b>lubricant</b> <b>flow</b> rate, when compared with the case of flow normal to the grooves.

Considerably less is known, however, about the <b>flow</b> of <b>lubricant</b> through such contacts. Information about <b>lubricant</b> <b>flow</b> would greatly benefit the prediction of friction in machine components.

The entrained lubricant was dyed using a fluorescent species, so that when illuminated with laser light, a fluorescence intensity map could be viewed. When the contact was fully flooded with dyed lubricant, the fluorescence intensity within the contact correlated well with optical interferometric film thickness measurements under the same conditions. This suggests useful possibilities for mapping film thickness in contacts where conventional optical methods are impractical, such as between rough surfaces and within soft contacts. In order to observe how <b>lubricant</b> <b>flows</b> in an EHL contact, fluorescer-containing lubricant was placed on the out-of-contact track.

At a Reynolds numbers of order 1000 {{a transition from}} laminar to unsteady flow is observed by an increase of the roughness height from about 10 % to about 25 % of the channel width. At lower Reynolds numbers (where the flow is laminar in both channels), the transition is observed when increasing the wall roughness further. In other words, the critical Reynolds number for the transition from laminar toward unsteady flow decreases at higher wall roughness.
