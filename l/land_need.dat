The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) said on 23 April 2016 that it is prepared to return the land occupied by the hot spring to the Singapore Land Authority.

The ministry added that putting the place under a public agency means the <b>land</b> <b>need</b> not be tendered out {{to the highest bidder}} and become commercialised.|$|E
60|$|Now {{if these}} {{channels}} {{have ever been}} rivers they must have flowed from some higher regions, and {{this must have been}} to the east, because on the north and west the sea-bottom sinks down at a short distance from the shore to an unfathomable depth; whereas on the east, a shallow sea, nowhere exceeding fifty fathoms, extends quite across to New Guinea, a distance of about a hundred and fifty miles. An elevation of only three hundred feet would convert the whole of this sea into moderately high land, and make the Aru Islands a portion of New Guinea; and the rivers which have their mouths at Utanata and Wamuka, might then have flowed on across Aru, in the channels which are now occupied by salt water. Then the intervening land sunk down, we must suppose the land that now constitutes Aru to have remained nearly stationary, a not very improbable supposition, when we consider the great extent of the shallow sea, and the very small amount of depression the <b>land</b> <b>need</b> have undergone to produce it.|$|E

"Yet, my child, {{what could}} Grant or Sherman have done, {{if it had}} not been for the {{thousands}} of brave privates who were content to do each their imperceptible little,--{{if it had not}} been for the poor, unnoticed, faithful, never-failing common soldiers, who did the work and bore the suffering? No one man saved our country, or could save it; nor could the men have saved it without the women. Every mother that said to her son, Go; every wife that strengthened the hands of her husband; every girl who sent courageous letters to her betrothed; every woman who worked for a fair; every grandam whose trembling hands knit stockings and scraped lint; every little maiden who hemmed shirts and made comfort-bags for soldiers,--each and all have been the joint doers of a great heroic work, the doing of which has been the regeneration of our era. A whole generation has learned the luxury of thinking heroic thoughts and being conversant with heroic deeds, and I have faith to believe that all this is not to go out in a mere crush of fashionable luxury and folly and frivolous emptiness,--but that our girls are going to merit the high praise given us by De Tocqueville, when he placed first among the causes of our prosperity the noble character of American women. Because foolish female persons in New York are striving to outdo the demi-monde of Paris in extravagance, it must not follow that every sensible and patriotic matron, and every nice, modest young girl, must forthwith and without inquiry rush as far after them as they possibly can. Because Mrs. Shoddy opens a ball in a two-thousand-dollar lace dress, every girl in the <b>land</b> <b>need</b> not look with shame on her modest white muslin.

5000|$|Austin {{does not}} make {{explicit}} political statements in The Land of Little Rain. With her voice marginalized by the male-dominated nature movement at the time, Austin's politics work instead through the aesthetics of representation; The Land of Little Rain is itself a critique of patriarchal conventions of nature writing. It speaks to what Heike Schafer calls an [...] "aesthetic political agenda". Austin's vivid descriptions {{of the land in}} the novel are intended to suggest a sort of [...] "regionalized utopia" [...] that requires an intimate understanding of the land. Austin feels that in order to achieve social harmony, humanity has to work with nature, not against it. The stories in The Land of Little Rain feature the deleterious influences of man on nature, including the wasting of pastures by grazing domesticated herds and the ceaseless mining of resources, which destroy the land, though not irreparably. This suggests that just as the land of the Southwest needs to be rejuvenated, the cultures of the Southwest region, inherently tied to the <b>land,</b> <b>need</b> a cultural regeneration.|$|E
5000|$|The Oak Bay Green Committee (OBGC) is a {{community}} grassroots volunteer organization in Oak Bay, British Columbia. It was formed in early 2005 after a developer cut down a venerable beech tree in South Oak Bay. Neighbors were so upset {{by the loss of}} the tree and the lack of comprehensive tree protection bylaws in the municipality that they lobbied Oak Bay Mayor and Council members to create better tree protection bylaws. The OBGC's initial activism stemmed from the belief that mature trees of all species, on public and private <b>land,</b> <b>need</b> better stewardship from the community. After almost two years of community groups, individuals, the mayor, and council working together, Oak Bay Municipality adopted Tree Protection Bylaw 4326 on August 21, 2006. The OBGC continues to promote awareness of the importance of having an urban forest in the community. Although the OBGC formed as an ad hoc committee working for better tree protection bylaws, the OBGC decided to continue on as a local environmental group and work on other community-based environmental initiatives. Other OBGC projects include community school visits, Oak Bay Library environmental displays, a sewage treatment alliance, a soft plastic recycling depot, community climate change awareness, and a [...] "no engine idling" [...] campaign. OBGC works in conjunction with St. Philip's Anglican Church and Pacific Mobile Depots.|$|E
5000|$|Though {{some small}} farms were owned by lower class {{citizens}} and soldiers, {{much of the}} land was controlled by the noble class of Rome. Land ownership {{was just one of}} many distinctions that set the aristocracy apart from the lower classes. Aristocracy would [...] "reorganize small holdings into larger more profitable farms in order to compete with other nobles." [...] It was considered a point of pride to own not just the largest piece of land, but also to have land that grew high quality produce. As Marcus Cato wrote [...] "when they would praise a worthy man their praise took this form: 'Good husband good farmer'; it is from the farming class that the bravest men and the sturdiest soldiers come." [...] The farms would produce a variety of crops depending on the season, and focused on trying to acquire the best possible farm under the best possible conditions. Cato discusses many of the primary focuses of the farmer and how to distinguish a great piece of land. He notes that a good farmer must take precious time to examine the land, looking over every detail. Not only did the <b>land</b> <b>need</b> to be perfect for purchase, but the neighbors must maintain their farms as well because [...] "if the district was good, they should be well kept." [...] Individuals looking to buy a piece of land had to also take into consideration the weather of the area, the condition of the soil, and how close the farm would be to a town or port. Careful planning went into every detail of owning and maintaining a farm in Roman culture.|$|E

40|$|While {{the last}} 50 years of {{agriculture}} {{have focused on}} meeting the food, feed, and fiber needs of humans, the challenges for the next 50 years go far beyond simply {{addressing the needs of}} an ever-growing global population.

Biotechnology and other emerging life sciences technologies offer valuable tools to help meet these multidimensional challenges. This paper explores the possibilities afforded through biotechnology in providing improved agronomic “input” traits, differentiated crops that impart more desirable “output” traits, and using plants as green factories to fortify foods with valuable nutrients naturally rather than externally during food processing. The concept of leveraging agriculture as green factories is expected to have tremendous positive implications for harnessing solar energy to meet fiber and fuel needs as well. Widespread adaptation of biotech-derived products of agriculture should lay the foundation for transformation of our society from a production-driven system to a quality and utility-enhanced system...|$|E

30|$|Since the Malay reserve {{lands are}} {{situated}} within the town boundaries, local planning authorities should have prepared development plans encompassing {{the area in}} which development policies have been outlined (Morshidi 2000). In addition, the development plan preparation report mentions that most of states in Peninsular Malaysia have had their structure plans and some local plans are deposited (Mitchell and Joseph 2010). However, a glance observation portrayed that the progress of physical development in Malay reserve lands is really slow (City Hall Kuala Lumpur 2000). The key questions are: what policies have been carried out by the responsible local authorities and agencies and what obstacles are faced during policy implementation. Besides the local authority’s responsibilities, land owners are also required to devote more efforts in developing their land of at least equivalent to their neighbor’s achievements. Financial aids have been arranged by the government. Therefore, the land owners’ attitudes are questionable. The underlying factors that are influencing Malay reserve land owners against developing the <b>land</b> <b>need</b> to be further studied. This is the main motivator for the research; while existing barriers have been closely examined, {{it is clear that the}} attitudes and desires of the land owners has been neglected, even though this may represent a significant barrier.|$|E
40|$|Although {{making up}} about 1 % {{of the total}} world ocean surface, the Mediterranean Sea is often used as a {{representative}} model of the world's oceans. Due to its practically enclosed character, it is also often {{used to assess the}} global change of the environment. Anthropogenic activities have contributed significantly to the existing nutrient enrichment and consequent eutrophication problems in the Mediterranean Sea. At the present, however, mainly due to the favourable circumstances regarding the hydrology, morphology as well as absence of significant upwelling of the Mediterranean basin as a whole, severe eutrophication cases are limited to specific coastal areas (UNEP 2003).

At the same time farmers and other managers of rural <b>land</b> <b>need</b> access to increasingly complex and varied information and advice when making land use and business decisions. This paper reviews the range of ways in which advisory services are provided in developed countries. Research findings • Governments have a legitimate need to influence land use in the wider public and environmental interest. But design and delivery of advisory services must be based on a coherent understanding of how and why land managers make decisions, particularly those that involve substantial or complex change in management strategy. • Land managers benefit from having an array of diverse services and providers, but may require professional support to identify those most appropriate to their circumstances. • Electronic information and communication technologies (ICTs) can provide cost-effective interactive tools to complement advisory schemes. However the internet is not yet a cost-effective way of distributing information widely: for most land managers it is not a natural choice of information source. • Land managers develop new knowledge through a learning process, not by simple ‘knowledge transfer’.
