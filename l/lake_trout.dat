5|$|Fishing is {{a popular}} {{activity}} in the BWCAW. Game species include northern pike, muskellunge, walleye, largemouth and smallmouth bass, and panfish. Trout including brook trout, brown trout, <b>lake</b> <b>trout,</b> rainbow trout and splake are also found. Limited stocking of walleye, brown trout and <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> is done on some lakes.|$|E
5|$|Whitefish and vendace are {{the most}} common fish species in Lake Inari, the latter having been accidentally naturalized. <b>Lake</b> <b>trout</b> can be caught in creeks. Other fish found in the park include Arctic char, grayling, pike, perch, burbot, three-spined stickleback, ninespine stickleback and minnow. Stocking with fish has {{resulted}} in the introduction of Atlantic salmon, vendace and <b>lake</b> <b>trout.</b>|$|E
5|$|Eighteen {{species of}} fish live in Yellowstone, {{including}} the core range of the Yellowstone cutthroat trout—a fish highly sought by anglers. The Yellowstone cutthroat trout has faced several threats since the 1980s, including the suspected illegal introduction into Yellowstone Lake of <b>lake</b> <b>trout,</b> an invasive species which consume the smaller cutthroat trout. Although <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> were established in Shoshone and Lewis lakes in the Snake River drainage from U.S. Government stocking operations in 1890, it was never officially introduced into the Yellowstone River drainage. The cutthroat trout has also faced an ongoing drought, {{as well as the}} accidental introduction of a parasite—whirling disease—which causes a terminal nervous system disease in younger fish. Since 2001, all native sport fish species caught in Yellowstone waterways are subject to a catch and release law. Yellowstone is also home to six species of reptiles, such as the painted turtle and Prairie rattlesnake, and four species of amphibians, including the Boreal Chorus Frog.|$|E

5|$|John Jacob Astor's American Fur Company was {{centered}} on Mackinac Island after the War of 1812 and exported beaver pelts for thirty years. By {{the middle of}} the 19th century, commercial fishing for common whitefish and <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> began to replace the fur trade as the island's primary industry. As sport fishing became more popular in the 1880s, hotels and restaurants accommodated tourists coming by train or lake boat from Detroit.|$|E
5|$|Presque Isle State Park has two {{distinct}} fishing zones. Lake Erie {{is home to}} perch, trout, walleye, bass, and steelhead. Presque Isle Bay {{is the home of}} muskellunge, northern pike, crappie, smelt, as well as other fish that swim in from the <b>lake.</b> <b>Trout</b> fishing is also allowed in the two waterworks basins, which are stocked by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. Hunting is prohibited at Presque Isle State Park with the exception of controlled duck and goose hunting seasons in designated blinds.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of bull trout and other native {{species of fish}} in Banff's lakes has also dwindled, {{with the introduction of}} non-native species including brook trout, and rainbow trout. <b>Lake</b> <b>trout,</b> westslope cutthroat trout, and Chiselmouth are rare native species, while chinook salmon, White sturgeon, Pacific lamprey, and Banff longnose dace are likely extirpated locally. The Banff longnose dace, once only found in Banff, is now an extinct species.|$|E
50|$|The {{highway is}} {{a gravel road}} between Meadow Creek {{at the north end}} of Kootenay <b>Lake</b> and <b>Trout</b> <b>Lake.</b> Care should be taken when driving the route as it is narrow and has drop offs into <b>Trout</b> <b>Lake</b> north of Gerrard.|$|R
50|$|<b>Trout</b> <b>Lake,</b> {{also known}} as <b>Trout</b> <b>Lake</b> City, is an unincorporated rural {{community}} and former mining and railway-speculation boomtown located {{at the north end}} of <b>Trout</b> <b>Lake</b> in the West Kootenay district of southeastern British Columbia, Canada. The Lardeau River runs into <b>Trout</b> <b>Lake</b> (the lake) and exits at the south end of the lake. It then runs as does the lake on a southeastern course to the community of Lardeau {{at the north end of}} Kootenay Lake, while beyond it and the townsite of <b>Trout</b> <b>Lake</b> at its northwestern end is a low pass to the Beaton Arm of Upper Arrow Lake at Galena Bay. Speculation on railway development through this pass promoted a great amount of speculation at <b>Trout</b> <b>Lake,</b> or <b>Trout</b> <b>Lake</b> City as it soon was proclaimed to be, as well as at Lardeau and other potential townsites along the rail line's route.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} lakes: Forcats (the pitchforks lake), Montmantell, Estany Negre (the black lake), and Les Truites <b>Lake</b> (the <b>trout</b> <b>lake).</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{total of}} 23 {{species of fish}} reside in park waters and native game fish species found in the lakes and streams include the westslope {{cutthroat}} trout, northern pike, mountain whitefish, kokanee salmon and Arctic grayling. Glacier {{is also home to}} the threatened bull trout, which is illegal to possess and must be returned to the water if caught inadvertently. Introduction in previous decades of <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> and other non-native fish species has greatly impacted some native fish populations, especially the bull trout and west slope cutthroat trout.|$|E
5|$|Fish in the Willamette basin include 31 native species, {{among them}} cutthroat, bull, and rainbow trout, {{several species of}} salmon, sucker, minnow, sculpin, and lamprey, as well as sturgeon, stickleback, and others. Among the 29 {{non-native}} species in the basin, there are brook, brown, and <b>lake</b> <b>trout,</b> largemouth and smallmouth bass, walleye, carp, bluegill, and others. In addition to fish, the basin supports 18 species of amphibians, such as the Pacific giant salamander. Beaver and river otter are among 69 mammal species living in the watershed, also frequented by 154 bird species, such as the American dipper, osprey, and harlequin duck. Garter snakes are among the 15 species of reptiles found in the basin.|$|E
5|$|The Snake River fine-spotted {{cutthroat}} trout (or Snake River {{cutthroat trout}}) {{is the only}} native trout species in Grand Teton National Park. It is also the only subspecies of cutthroat trout that is exclusively native to large streams and rivers. Various researchers {{have not been able}} to identify any genetic differences between the Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout and the Yellowstone cutthroat trout, though in terms of appearances, the Snake River subspecies has much smaller spots which cover a greater portion of the body, and the two subspecies inhabit different ecological niches. The Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout was identified by some researchers as a separate subspecies by the mid-1990s, and is managed as a distinct subspecies by the state of Wyoming, but is not yet recognized as such by the neighboring states of Idaho and Montana. Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout is found only in the Snake River and tributaries below the Jackson Lake dam to the Palisades Reservoir in Idaho. Other non-native species of trout such as the rainbow trout and <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> were introduced by the Wyoming Fish and Game Department or migrated out of Yellowstone. Today five trout species inhabit park waters. Native species of fish include the mountain whitefish, longnose dace, mountain sucker and non-native species include the Utah chub and Arctic grayling.|$|E
50|$|This is disputed however, as the {{demarcation}} line that is referenced in provincial documents is the Nipissing Passageway, originally an Indian trail between Georgian Bay and the Ottawa River. The trail follows the French River from Georgian Bay to Lake Nipissing.

25|$|Biologists {{have been}} trying to control {{lampreys}} in the lake since 1985 or earlier. Lampreys are native to the area but have expanded in population {{to such an extent that}} they wounded nearly all <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> in 2006 and 70–80% of salmon. The use of pesticides against the lamprey has reduced their casualties of other fish to 35% of salmon and 31% of <b>lake</b> <b>trout.</b> The goal was 15% of salmon and 25% of <b>lake</b> <b>trout.</b>|$|E

25|$|Yellowstone {{cutthroat}} trout (Oncorhynchus clarki bouvieri) have suffered considerable declines since European settlement, but recently began flourishing in some areas. Especially in Yellowstone Lake itself, long-term records indicate an almost remarkable restoration of robust populations from only {{three decades ago}} when the numbers of this fish were depleted because of excessive harvest. Its current recovery, though a significant management achievement, does not begin to restore the species' historical abundance. Also, they declined because of invasive <b>lake</b> <b>trout.</b> An aggressive <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> removal program has caused the cutthroats to rebound.|$|E
25|$|Yellowstone {{cutthroat}} trout generally {{declined in the}} second half of the 20th century due to angler overharvest, competition with exotic fishes, and overzealous egg collection. Populations rebounded in the park after the advent of catch-and-release-only fishing rules in the 1970s, but new and aggressive invaders are causing an increasing threat to these native fish and alarming park fisheries biologists. Nonnative <b>lake</b> <b>trout,</b> an effective fish predator, were discovered in Yellowstone Lake in 1994. Throughout the west {{cutthroat trout}} populations preyed upon by introduced <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> have typically declined, exhibited lower growth, or have disappeared. Aggressive <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> control efforts by the National Park Service and no harvest limits have resulted in removing thousands of <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> from Yellowstone Lake since 1994, including more than 12,000 in 2000. Still, the number of Yellowstone cutthroat trout monitored during the annual fall count in Yellowstone Lake was lower in recent years than at any other time in the 25-year history of the monitoring effort. Whirling disease, which has been implicated in recent years in the decline of trout populations in many western states, was discovered in Yellowstone Lake in 1998. So far, it is unclear which of these two nonnative invaders has been the greater factor in the decline of Yellowstone cutthroat trout, but there is no question they are causing it.|$|E
