40|$|Abstract. This {{paper has}} the {{objective}} {{to evaluate the}} technical feasibility of incorporation of <b>leather</b> <b>powder</b> in mortars. First a physical characterization of aggregate was carried and then preceded to {{the dissolution of the}} <b>leather</b> <b>powder</b> in alkaline solution, in the proportion of 1 : 1 : 1 of waste, alkaline solution and water respectively, obtaining the processed waste. In the next step, it has been molded specimen using two reference recipes in terms of mass, 1 : 3 of cement and sand, and 1 : 1 : 6 of cement, hydrated lime and sand respectively, keeping constant the flow table consistency of 130 ± 10 mm and 220 ± 10 mm, for each respectively recipe. Two groups of mortars were produced: one without processed waste, one with 5 % and one with 10 % in ratio to the cement mass. Tests had been carried such as compressive strength to axial compression, tensile strength to diametrical compression, and adherence strength on surfaces. The resistance tests performed; also the analyses of the leachate and solubilized extracts confirmed the feasibility of incorporation of <b>leather</b> <b>powder</b> in mortars...|$|E
50|$|Bark mills were water, steam, horse, ox or {{wind-powered}} edge mills used {{to process}} the bark, roots, and branches of various tree species into a fine powder known as tanbark, used for tanning <b>leather.</b> This <b>powdering</b> allowed the tannin to be extracted more efficiently from its woody source material. A barker would strip the bark from trees so {{that it might be}} ground in such mills, and the dried bark was often stored in bark houses.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to obtain certain PVC films with {{improved}} hygienic properties, with applications both in the artificial leather industry and in other domains. This was done by introducing certain hydrophilic auxiliaries with free chemical functions into the chemical structure of the PVC films, such as: collagen hydrolysates (CH), hydroxyl-terminated polydimethylsiloxane (HTPDMS) and nonylphenol ethoxylate (NPE). The use of these hydrophilic auxiliaries combined with the action of the high frequency electric fields (H. F. E. F.) allows the attainment of cellular structures where the walls of the cells obtained from the expanding process display an enhanced humidity absorption. The collagen hydrolysates used to obtain the plasticized PVC porous films was obtained by electrolytic hydrolysis starting from Chamois <b>leather</b> <b>powder</b> waste resulting from buffing operation, according to a methodology described in a previous paper. The first part of this study was concerned with the influence of the addition of hydrophilic agents upon the moisture sorption of the plasticized PVC porous films. In this paper, there was investigated the water vapour and air permeability as well as the water vapour absorption of the porous films expanded in the H. F. E. F. in correlation with the nature and the recipe variant of the hydrophilic auxiliaries. The results highlighted the fact that the use of certain combinations of hydrophilic agents led to obtaining materials with adequate hygienic properties. ...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{powder coating}} binder {{system based on}} UV-curable, semi-crystalline {{polyurethane}} acrylates has been developed for heat-sensitive and highly flexible substrates, such as <b>leather.</b> The developed <b>powder</b> coating film had good abrasion and adhesion properties. The concepts applied in this work {{were based on the}} adjustment and control of the degree of crystallinity of hinders by three ways: (i) formulating different molecular weight monomers for random copolymerization, (ii) introducing functional monomer with pendant groups and (iii) cross-linking during curing. Amongst the three approaches explored in this work, a combination of branching and cross-linking was found most successful. A crystalline binder with cross-linkable pendant groups was employed as the powder coating main binder; this is the major difference from other work on powder coatings where amorphous resin alone or partially blended with a crystalline component are used as binders. The preparation of UV curable powder coating binder resins and their properties, such as crystallinity, viscosity and tensile modulus and elongation to break have been studied by DSC, SEM, FTIR-ATR and DMTA methods. It was found that the polyurethane acrylate binders (made from DHBA, BEP, DEG and HDI etc.) are potentially useful for formulating novel powder coatings. The properties of the developed <b>powder</b> coating finished <b>leather</b> have been tested. Hot plating processes and an EMB application method for leather finishing have been discussed as well. Nano-scale silica particles surface modified with acrylate has been studied, and their properties or properties of powder coatings formulated with the particles have been characterized. The powder coating rub fastness was improved by formulation with surface modified nano-scale silica particles...|$|R
40|$|Inspired by an {{interest}} in finding both a natural material alternative {{as well as a}} successful treatment approach to <b>powdering</b> <b>leather</b> surfaces on a Native American object, a comparative study of two novel treatment materials and two established consolidants for leather with red rot was undertaken. Natural material consolidants have been demonstrated to be preferred by tribal members for use on materials other than leather. One of the materials tested as a potential consolidant was neri, an aqueous mucilage most commonly extracted from the roots of the aibika plant that is used in the traditional production of Japanese paper. The other material selected was chitosan, the main derivative of the natural polymer chitin, which has recently been applied in treatments of archaeological silk and paper. The performance of these potential materials as leather consolidants was compared against the performance of established modified organic consolidants, i. e. mixtures of Cellugel and Klucel G with the acrylic wax SC 6000. The study focused on evaluating each material's consolidation performance, the visual and physical changes observed on the leather, and the chemical stability of the consolidant following heat and light aging. Although neri proved to have excellent chemical stability, it is not recommended for leather due to unavoidable water content and unsatisfactory working properties. Though chitosan had no adverse effects towards the appearance and feel of the leather, it is not recommended as a consolidant until further research is conducted on its chemical stability. The Klucel G with SC 6000 mixture had great application properties but the wax component is questionable due to the opacity change of the aged wax. Cellugel demonstrated the most desirable properties in performance and chemical stability; therefore it was selected as the consolidant for the treatment on the Native American object. Experimental results indicate that the natural materials evaluated may be recommended as alternatives to synthetic consolidants following additional research...|$|R
