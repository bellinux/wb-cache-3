5|$|Die casting {{equipment}} {{was invented in}} 1838 {{for the purpose of}} producing movable type for the printing industry. The first die casting-related patent was granted in 1849 for a small hand-operated machine for the purpose of mechanized printing type production. In 1885 Otto Mergenthaler invented the <b>linotype</b> <b>machine,</b> an automated type-casting device which became the prominent type of equipment in the publishing industry. The Soss die-casting machine, manufactured in Brooklyn, NY, was the first machine to be sold in the open market in North America. Other applications grew rapidly, with die casting facilitating the growth of consumer goods and appliances by making affordable the production of intricate parts in high volumes. In 1966, General Motors released the Acurad process.|$|E
25|$|Some {{linotype}} machines {{included a}} paper tape reader. This allowed {{the text to}} be typeset to be supplied over a telegraph line (TeleTypeSetter). It also allowed for several tape perforator operators to prepare paper tape to be processed by a single <b>linotype</b> <b>machine,</b> essentially decoupling the typing speed of the operators from the operating speed of the <b>linotype</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1910, the Mokarzel {{brothers}} {{decided to}} adapt the <b>linotype</b> <b>machine</b> to Arabic script to mitigate the expensive cost and tedious task of manual typesetting. Naoum Mokarzel imported Arabic type letters from Egypt and acquired the first such machine for Al-Hoda from the Mergenthaler company. While the <b>linotype</b> <b>machine</b> made printing cheaper, there was significant competition for readership since New York's Arabic-speaking community did not exceed 10,000 before World War II.|$|E

25|$|The most {{significant}} {{innovation in the}} <b>linotype</b> <b>machine</b> was that it automated the distribution step; i.e.,returning the matrices and space bands back to the correct place in their respective magazines. This {{is done by the}} distributor.|$|E

25|$|The Mergenthaler <b>Linotype</b> <b>machine</b> {{was used}} by {{newspaper}} printers from the 1880s to the 1970s. Technological progress again confronted the ITU in the post-war period. A number of new advances—including offset lithography, flexography, relief print, screen printing, rotogravure, and digital printing—greatly {{reduced the number of}} workers needed in the modern printshop and newspaper composing room.|$|E

25|$|The casting section {{receives}} completed {{lines from}} the assembler, and uses these to cast the type slugs that {{are the product of}} the <b>linotype</b> <b>machine.</b> The casting section is automatic: once it is activated by the operator sending a completed line by raising the casting lever, a series of cams and levers move the matrices through the casting section and control the sequence of steps that produce the slug.|$|E
25|$|Type {{foundries}} {{have cast}} fonts in lead alloys from the 1450s until the present, although wood {{served as the}} material for some large fonts called wood type during the 19th century, particularly in the United States. In the 1890s the mechanization of typesetting allowed automated casting of fonts on the fly as lines of type in the size and length needed. This was known as continuous casting, and remained profitable and widespread until its demise in the 1970s. The first machine of this type was the <b>Linotype</b> <b>machine,</b> invented by Ottmar Mergenthaler.|$|E
25|$|The <b>linotype</b> <b>machine</b> {{operator}} enters text on a 90-character keyboard. The machine assembles matrices, {{which are}} molds for the letter forms, in a line. The assembled line is then {{cast as a}} single piece, called a slug, of type metal in {{a process known as}} hot metal typesetting. The matrices are then returned to the type magazine from which they came, to be reused later. This allows much faster typesetting and composition than original hand composition in which operators place down one pre-cast glyph (metal letter, punctuation mark or space) at a time.|$|E
50|$|The {{capital letters}} in HoTMetaL spell HTML. The term comes from hot metal {{typesetting}} which involves melting alloys {{into the shape}} of letters so they can be used by <b>Linotype</b> <b>machines</b> to print words on paper.|$|R

25|$|Frederic F. Heath {{was born}} September 6, 1864 to a Republican family in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. As a young man, Heath worked {{variously}} as a teacher, a printer, a wood engraver, and an artist for wood engravers, the latter trades rendered largely obsolete by {{the invention of}} the <b>linotype</b> <b>machine</b> and the half-tone printing process. He moved to Chicago in 1886, moving to Florida in 1887 to publish a magazine called the Florida Fruit Grower. In 1888 he returned to his native Milwaukee, where he drew portraits and wrote editorials for the Milwaukee Daily Sentinel.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} 1914, both editors {{were seeking}} change. Planning his retirement, Bratlie invited Ralph J. Benjamin to edit and invest into The Concrete Herald with an option to {{purchase}} the controlling stake in the paper. On March 9, 1915, however, the newspaper's three-story wooden building {{and most of its}} equipment were destroyed by a fire, and Benjamin had to abandon the paper, losing his investment. Bratlie suffered a loss that according to different accounts amounted from $7,000 to $9,000, but saved the paper, salvaged one <b>Linotype</b> <b>machine</b> that survived the fire, and continued publishing, installing W.J.S. Gordon (and later M.G. Flower) as temporary editors.|$|E
25|$|The {{magazine}} holds {{a particular}} font of type; i.e., {{a particular type}} design in a particular size. If a different size or style was needed, the operator would switch to a different magazine. Many models of the <b>Linotype</b> <b>machine</b> could keep several magazines (as many as four) available at a time. In some of these, the operator could shift to a different magazine by raising or lowering the stack of magazines with a crank. Such machines would not allow mixing fonts within a single line. Others, such as the Model 9, allowed arbitrary mixing of text from up to four magazines within a single line.|$|E
50|$|Everything {{originally}} was handset, but, within four years, Lee had moved the newspaper to larger quarters and eventually acquired three <b>linotype</b> <b>machines.</b> During its 10th anniversary in September 1921, the newspaper went to twice-a-week publication, {{and three years}} later went to five days a week, Monday through Friday.|$|R
25|$|Gill was {{commissioned}} {{to develop a}} typeface {{with the number of}} allographs limited to what could be used on Monotype or <b>Linotype</b> <b>machines.</b> The typeface was loosely based on the Arabic Naskh style but was considered unacceptably far from the norms of Arabic script. It was rejected and never cut into type.|$|R
5000|$|... "My dad {{was doing}} {{more of the}} journalistic side of art direction, for newspapers, and I was really {{intrigued}} by the machine of it all, the pace. There were no computers at the time, just huge <b>linotype</b> <b>machines</b> that weighed tons and used metal plates. There was an adrenaline rush about it all." ...|$|R
25|$|Matrices {{released}} from the magazine, and spacebands {{released from}} the spaceband box, drop down into the assembler. This is a rail that holds the matrices and spacebands, with a jaw on the left end set to the desired line width. When the operator judges that the line is close enough to full, he raises the casting lever {{on the bottom of}} the keyboard to send the line to the casting section of the <b>linotype</b> <b>machine.</b> The remaining processing for that line is automatic; as soon as the finished line has been transferred to the casting section, the operator can begin composing the next line of text.|$|E
25|$|Clemens {{invested}} heavily in the typesetting machine invented by James W. Paige. He also formed the firm Charles L. Webster & Company which published his writings, along with Ulysses S. Grant's memoirs. Its first publication was Adventures of Huckleberry Finn in 1884. The company went bankrupt in 1894, leaving Twain with {{a large amount of}} debt; Paige's typesetting machine never functioned properly and was overcome by competition from the <b>linotype</b> <b>machine</b> developed by Whitlaw Reid. The losses from these investments as well as several bank panics led the Clemens family to move to Europe in 1891 where the cost of living was more affordable. He began lecturing across the continent to recoup some money for their family.|$|E
25|$|Supporters {{with limited}} budgets {{were allowed to}} pay in four instalments, but when a reader of the weekly newspaper, writing {{in the name of}} low-paid workers with large families, {{suggested}} the creation of savings clubs, Griffith encouraged the idea enthusiastically. The public response was more enthusiastic this time and by 7 May 1909, the Board had already received 3,386 applications. Ó Ceallaigh's minutes for this period reflect an atmosphere of general optimism: the SFPP was in contact with several suppliers of printing equipment, was recruiting personnel, and was actively looking for a new publishing office and a location for its printshop. Griffith was a prudent businessman, however, and the SFPP negotiated simultaneously with the <b>Linotype</b> <b>Machine</b> Co. for the purchase of a Cox Duplex printing press, and the manager of the Ireland's Own Publishing Co., Mr. Walsh, for the printing of the newspaper. If the printshop failed once again to materialise, the SFPP would still have the option of subcontracting to Walsh.|$|E
50|$|The paper's {{very first}} edition was misprinted, with Page 1 {{being on the}} back and Page 2 on the front. Adonis Kyrou I. decided to keep {{printing}} the paper the same way, and the tradition continued to 1997, when it was abandoned because of technical difficulties arising from the change from <b>linotype</b> <b>machines</b> to computer-editing.|$|R
5000|$|Printers Row Lit Fest is {{an annual}} book fair and {{literary}} festival held in Chicago, Illinois. The fair's literary [...] "tableau [...] [...] [...] fills a downtown district where <b>linotype</b> <b>machines</b> and printing presses once whirred." [...] The neighborhood {{was an early}} book making hub. [...] It is held in early summer in June.|$|R
25|$|The company's {{first major}} project was the Linasec in 1964. It was an {{electronic}} special purpose computer, designed to justify papertape {{for use on}} automated <b>Linotype</b> <b>machines.</b> It was developed under contract to Compugraphic, who manufactured phototypesetters. Compugraphic retained the rights to manufacture the Linasec without royalty. They exercised these rights, effectively forcing Wang out of the market.|$|R
500|$|Whitelaw Reid, who won {{control of}} the Tribune {{in part due to}} the likely {{assistance}} of financier Jay Gould, turned the newspaper into an orthodox Republican organ, wearing [...] "its stubborn editorial and typographical conservatism…as a badge of honor". Reid's hostility to labor led him to bankroll Ottmar Mergenthaler's development of the <b>linotype</b> <b>machine</b> in 1886, which quickly spread throughout the industry. However, his day-to-day involvement in the operations of the Tribune declined after 1888, when he was appointed Minister to France and largely focused on his political career; Reid even missed a large-scale 50th anniversary party for the Tribune in 1891. Despite this, the paper remained profitable due to an educated and wealthy readership that attracted advertisers.|$|E
500|$|Tides 5–6ft (1.5–2m) {{above normal}} and storm surge in St. Petersburg damaged or {{destroyed}} all four fishing piers. Many ships and boats of all sizes capsized or were beached, including the trawler Hypnotist, which ejected the crew of seven into the water, {{all of whom were}} rescued. The St. Petersburg Beach Hotel was destroyed, after employees swam through the lobby for safety. At the office of the St. Petersburg Times, then located at Fifth Street and First Avenue South, the loss of electricity resulted in staff working overnight with lanterns. With no power to operate the typesetting machine, the employees connected their <b>linotype</b> <b>machine</b> to a two-cylinder motorcycle to publish the [...] "Motorcycle Extra". Two deaths occurred in St. Petersburg, one from a heart attack during preparations for the storm and the other from a man being crushed by a falling roof.|$|E
500|$|In October 1928, the News-Miner {{cut costs}} by {{moving to a}} new office. This allowed the {{purchase}} of a new <b>Linotype</b> <b>machine,</b> and further upgrades were promised when on November 8, 1929, the News-Miner was purchased by Austin E. Lathrop, an Alaska industrialist. [...] Though Lathrop promised to inject money into the News-Miner, his strong Republican leanings opposed those of Nordale, a confirmed Democrat. Nordale resigned in April 1930 and was replaced by Bernard Stone. Stone and Lathrop turned the News-Miner profitable before Stone was replaced by Charles R. Settlemier in 1936. In 1935, the News-Miner purchased two cylinder presses to replace the old flatbed press still in use. Owing to shipping difficulties, however, the presses and the new crew needed to operate them did not arrive until 1936. By that time, the News-Miner was preparing to move into the new Lathrop Building, built by and named after the newspaper's owner.|$|E
50|$|Dodsworth {{was born}} in England in 1827 and emigrated to the United States as a young man. Together with Newton F. Whiting he bought the Daily Commercial Bulletin in 1870, buying out his partner in 1881. He modernized the plant with <b>linotype</b> <b>machines</b> and in 1893 {{acquired}} the Journal of Commerce, consolidating the two papers under a joint title.|$|R
50|$|He envisioned that Oakland and Alameda County {{would grow}} {{in the future and}} that the Oakland Tribune would be the major {{newspaper}} to serve the new populace.
