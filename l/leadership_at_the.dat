5|$|At the May 1925 election, Bruxner {{retained}} {{his seat}} {{with an increased}} margin of 41%, while the Nationalist/Progressive Government lost office to Jack Lang and the Labor Party. After the election, the Progressive party renamed themselves the Country Party, reflecting the electoral base of the party. Bruxner resigned the <b>leadership</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of 1925, citing the difficulty in balancing the needs of his family with the commitments of his political career, and was succeeded by Ernest Buttenshaw.|$|E
5|$|Confusion is a 1975 studio album by Nigerian Afrobeat {{musician}} Fela Kuti and his Africa 70 band. It was arranged, composed, {{and produced}} by Kuti, who recorded the album after choosing to emphasize his African heritage and nationalism in his music. Confusion is {{a commentary on}} the confused state of post-colonial Lagos and its lack of infrastructure and proper <b>leadership</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. Kuti's pidgin English lyrics depict difficult conditions in the city, including a frenetic, multilingual trading market and inextricable traffic jams in Lagos' major intersections.|$|E

5|$|John {{initially}} {{adopted a}} defensive posture {{similar to that}} of 1199: avoiding open battle and carefully defending his key castles. John's operations became more chaotic as the campaign progressed, and Philip began to make steady progress in the east. John became aware in July that Arthur's forces were threatening his mother, Eleanor, at Mirebeau Castle. Accompanied by William de Roches, his seneschal in Anjou, he swung his mercenary army rapidly south to protect her. His forces caught Arthur by surprise and captured the entire rebel <b>leadership</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> battle of Mirebeau. With his southern flank weakening, Philip was forced to withdraw in the east and turn south himself to contain John's army.|$|E
5|$|In 1444, Skanderbeg {{had managed}} to unite the major Albanian princes under his <b>leadership</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> League of Lezhë, where a {{confederation}} of all the Albanian Principalities was created. Stresses within the alliance were felt, when Nicholas Dukagjini, {{a member of the}} Dukagjini family, a powerful family in northern Albania, ambushed and killed Lekë Zaharia Altisferi, prince of Dagnum and also League member. Since Zaharia had no children, he organized the killing to more easily gain Dagnum. The year in which Zaharia was killed is not recorded. A Venetian document dated to 4 January 1445, mentions Zaharia as the once lord of Dagnum which was given to Boxia, Zaharia's mother. The Venetian chronicler Stefano Magno says that Zaharia was killed close to the advent of the year 1445.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} the 1956–57 season, the {{selectors}} met {{to choose}} a team for a short non-Test tour of New Zealand. The leading contender for the captaincy was 28-year-old Victorian Neil Harvey, who had been a regular member of the team for eight years and was the senior batsman. However, both Harvey and Miller had been criticised for their attitude towards Johnson in an official report to the board about the 1956 tour. The selectors thus thrust Craig into the <b>leadership</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> age of 21 and a half. He was a young player leading an inexperienced team—the youngest cricket team from any country to be sent overseas, with no players older than 30. It was seen as a bold move, as Craig had only played six Tests, was far from being a regular member of the team and had only a year of captaincy at first-class level.|$|E
