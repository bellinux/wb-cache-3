500|$|The navy {{decided to}} convert Asahi into a {{submarine}} salvage ship {{and she began}} {{the first stage of}} her conversion with the installation of specialized salvage equipment from February to August 1925. From 1926 to October 1927, the ship's 25 Belleville boilers were replaced with four Kanpon Type RO boilers at Kure Naval Arsenal. One of her two funnels was also removed, and two large <b>lifting</b> <b>frames</b> were installed as part of the second stage of her conversion. The ship conducted experiments in submarine rescue using the old German submarine 0-1 (ex-). In May 1928, Asahi was fitted with a [...] compressed-air aircraft catapult on her forecastle and successfully launched an E2N1 Type 15 seaplane. After repeated accidents, the catapult was replaced by one powered by gunpowder. On the completion of testing in 1928, Asahi was placed in reserve.|$|E

50|$|Acting as gantry, the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> {{included}} {{a number of}} work platforms from which crewmen serviced the rocket. Three (later two) platforms folded flat against the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame,</b> and could be folded out from the elevated <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> {{with the use of}} a hand winch. Each folding platform {{included a}} safety rail of folding posts and chains.|$|R
50|$|A-Stoff: Liquid oxygen {{equipment}} {{consists of a}} pipe, which follows a circuitous route along the centreline of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame’s</b> lower half. The pipe is fixed on the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> by brackets, and closed at each end by cast ramp-and-claw seals.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> {{included}} two accommodations for the rocket, a nose clamp around the warhead and a pivoting clamp around the rocket midsection. Both accommodations included a saddle, and various mechanisms to assist dismount of the rocket onto its launch table. The mechanisms were operated with two drive shafts {{running up the}} port <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> beam. The drive shafts ran within the integral rungs, and were operated by a crewman with a ratchet hand tool.The two drive shafts comprised a short shaft and a long shaft; both starting at the trunnion end of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame,</b> one running half {{the length of the}} <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> while the other ran the full length.|$|R
50|$|Oil under {{pressure}} flowed from the hydraulic pump {{to the control}} valve group consisting of three valves in a common housing, manipulated via one large cross-handle and two small hand taps. The large cross-handle regulated the speed of raising or lowering the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame.</b> One hand tap selected direction to either raise or lower the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame.</b> The second hand tap controlled oil flow to the lowering piston (see below), to begin lowering of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> from its vertical position.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> was {{constructed}} of two formed I-beams, with tubular and box transverse braces. The <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> was fitted with plumbing for fuelling the rocket; wiring for powering and monitoring the rocket and for field telephones; accommodations for carrying and dismounting the rocket; and folding platforms {{to service the}} rocket with rungs to access them.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> {{was fitted}} with outlet sockets and wiring for field telephones. A main {{connection}} from the armoured launch vehicle switchboard to inlet sockets on the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> provided circuits for four field phone stations at the Meillerwagen - one each {{at the upper}} and lower folding work platforms and two at the launch table.|$|R
50|$|The rocket was {{provided}} with ejecting umbilical connectors, although their precise deployment evolved. Initially these 'Stotz plugs' travelled as Meillerwagen accessories, stowed on the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> {{along with their}} cables. Later, the Stotz plugs were stowed in the cable box, and a ten metre cable mast was stowed on the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> for ultimate erection on the launch table at the launch site.|$|R

40|$|The diploma {{thesis is}} focused on the {{construction}} design of elevator for pallets with car seats weighing 200 kg. This device is proposed for vertical transport of the load between two working positions which are separated by 6 m. Part of the pallet hoist is a roller conveyor attached on a <b>lifting</b> <b>frame.</b> The roller conveyor allows loading and unloading pallets from the fixed roller conveyors in the lower and upper station. There are the functional calculations of important parts, strength control of traction belt and shaft of driving pulley drum. By FEM (Finite Element Method) is detected stress distribution of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame.</b> Parts of the annex are the manufacturing drawings of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame,</b> shaft of driving drum, the driving station and drawing of the whole assembly vertical conveyor. Furthermore, the timing diagram function for one cycle, risk analysis and FMEA...|$|R
50|$|The port beam of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> {{was fitted}} with around 40 rungs along its full length, with which crewmen {{climbed to the}} working platforms.|$|R
50|$|An early {{configuration}} of the Meillerwagen included hard-wiring of two electrical power circuits and two FLAK-plug circuits for the power and control needs of the rocket. The system included four sockets at the upper and {{at the lower end}} of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame,</b> and the connective wiring fixed along the starboard beam. The four circuits were connected to two Stotz ejecting plugs, stowed with their cables along the side of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame.</b> All of this wiring had become redundant by the time the rocket attacks began, but was not removed from the Meillerwagen.|$|R
50|$|B-Stoff: Ethyl alcohol {{equipment}} {{consists of}} a pipe which runs along {{the full length of}} the starboard beam of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame.</b> The pipe is slung from the underside on straps, and closed at each end by threaded seals.|$|R

50|$|The <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> erected {{the rocket}} from {{horizontal}} to vertical, using hydraulic power. The hydraulic lifting equipment {{consisted of a}} hydraulic pump and its drive motor, a hydraulic fluid tank, a control valve group with manometers, and the lifting pistons themselves.|$|R
50|$|The {{long drive}} shaft {{ran along the}} full length of the port beam of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame.</b> It entered a worm gear at the pivot clamp, then {{continued}} to the nose clamp where it entered another worm gear. A shift lever at the nose clamp disengaged the drive shaft to allow either simultaneous or independent operation of the two worm gears. The worm gear at the pivot clamp operated a pair of scissor arms, one {{on each side of the}} <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> to insert or extract the trunnion pins from the rocket. The worm gear at the nose clamp operated the jaws of the nose clamp to either open or close, thus enclosing or releasing the rocket.|$|R
50|$|Two side {{platforms}} or catwalks were {{inserted into}} holders for deployment {{on each side}} of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame,</b> otherwise stowed together on brackets near the turntable. A rotating platform could be suspended from the rocket nose, to provide access to the rocket control compartments on the far side of the rocket.|$|R
50|$|Each {{front corner}} of the chassis was fitted with a swing-out A-frame boom {{equipped}} with a screw jack and foot plate. The booms enlarged the Meillerwagen footprint to stabilise it during erection of the rocket, and provided a means of adjusting the Meillerwagen transverse level. The booms deployed outward and forward of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> trunnion axis to prevent it toppling forward or to either side.|$|R
50|$|The bridge had a {{total length}} of 360 metres; {{the length of the}} <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> is 51.7 metres and its height 35 metres. The centre pier of the old swing bridge was left in place as an {{additional}} abutment for the lifting section; that and a lightweight design of the actual lifting section resulted in considerable savings in the weight of the moving part of the bridge.|$|R

50|$|The two {{hydraulic}} lifting pistons each {{consisted of}} one stationary cylinder and four extending telescopic cylinders. The largest extending cylinder included a flange halfway along its length, against which hydraulic pressure could be selectively applied from either above or below; {{it was used}} during raising to delay its extension until all other cylinders had extended, and also to begin the lowering process when the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> was vertical (once lowering had thus been initiated, gravity finished the job).|$|R
5000|$|P-Stoff: Compressed {{nitrogen}} (or compressed air) {{equipment to}} service the rocket consists of several batteries of compressed air tanks carried on the chassis frame, and a pipe fixed to {{the full length of}} the starboard beam of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame.</b> The P-stoff batteries consist of one bank of six fixed tanks, and two banks of two removable tanks. (compressed air for the Meillerwagen pneumatic brakes was sourced from a separate set of two tanks across the front of the chassis frame) ...|$|R
50|$|Now rarely used, but {{for many}} years {{the only way to}} move a {{disabled}} vehicle without using a low loader or trailer. Chains were attached, usually around the casualty's suspension, and some form of packing (often a seat squab or tyre) was inserted between the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> and the casualty. This <b>frame</b> was <b>lifted</b> by means of a pulley until the casualty’s wheels were clear of the ground. An 'A' frame was normally used to keep the casualty from running into the tow vehicle on braking.|$|R
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1982, after three intense seasons of archaeological {{underwater}} work, preparations began for raising the ship. The operation soon ran into problems: early on there were difficulties with the custom-made lifting equipment; divers on the project belonging to the Royal Engineers had to be pulled because of {{the outbreak of the}} Falklands War; and the method of lifting the hull had to be considerably altered as late as June. After the frame was properly attached to the hull it was slowly jacked up on four legs straddling the wreck site to pull the ship off the seabed. The massive crane of the barge Tog Mor was then used to <b>lift</b> the <b>frame</b> and hull on to the specially designed cradle which was padded with water-filled bags. On the morning of [...] 1982, the final lift of the entire package of cradle, hull and <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> began. At 9:03 the first timbers of the Mary Rose broke the surface {{in the presence of the}} team, Prince Charles and curious spectators on boats circling the site. A second set of bags under the hull was inflated with air to cushion the waterlogged wood and finally the whole package was transferred to the barge that would take the hull ashore. Though eventually successful, the operation was close to floundering on two occasions; first when one of the supporting legs of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> was bent and had to be removed and later when a corner of the frame, with [...] "an unforgettable crunch", slipped more than a metre (3feet) and came close to crushing part of the hull.|$|R
50|$|The Meillerwagen {{carried a}} number of {{accessories}} on the chassis and <b>lifting</b> <b>frame,</b> both for itself and the rocket. A toolbox fixed on the chassis carried snow chains, a tyre pump, and assorted tools for the Meillerwagen and KdF motor. The chassis was equipped {{with a pair of}} blast shields, entrenching tools, a hand-steering A-frame, two jacks, a spare tyre and a folding ladder. Special trays were fixed on the chassis to carry the transport cases which held various rocket accessories such as the graphite steering vanes, the nose fuse, and the Z-stoff (permanganate) flask.|$|R
50|$|The rocket {{was raised}} via the Meillerwagen <b>lift</b> <b>frame</b> and hydraulics. When vertical, the rocket was {{suspended}} above the firing stand, which {{was raised to}} touch the rocket fins. Clamping collars were used to connect the rocket to the firing stand, and the Meillerwagen was withdrawn less than a meter and the rocket was turned a quarter turn for the fuel connections to face the Meillerwagen platforms, which were lowered into position for standing. A separate three-section extendable ladder, the Magirus ladder, was used for areas of an erected rocket not accessible via the Meillerwagen.|$|R

50|$|The {{short drive}} shaft {{operated}} the pivot clamp around the rocket midsection, which could move the rocket 28 mm (~1") forward or backward along its centreline. The rocket midsection was {{fitted with a}} band which included trunnion pins placed in opposition; the pivot clamp held the rocket by the trunnion pins. The pivot clamp was able to rock on a transverse shaft, thus causing the rocket to move along its centreline. After erection of the rocket to a vertical position, it was held suspended above the launch table; by use of the pivot clamp, {{the weight of the}} rocket could be gently lowered onto the launch table until fully taken up, allowing the rocket to be unsecured from the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame,</b> thus dismounting it from the Meillerwagen.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} two digital filters {{are applied to}} {{elaborate}} acceleration data acquired from two accelerometers fixed in a <b>lift</b> <b>frame</b> during safety gears tests. The experimental tests consist in free falls of a test lift car and the subsequent gripping phases initiated by the safety gears activation due to over-speed condition. Unfortunately, the reliability of acceleration data is heavily impaired by measurement noise, which needs to be suppressed to the largest extent possible {{in order to use}} the data for comfort evaluation. To this end, two classes of digital filters are tested: the Savitzky–Golay and the Butterworth filters. This choice is motivated by the key features of these filters, including their computational simplicity and high suitability to represent time varying features in acceleration measurements. A tuning procedure is proposed for these filters, such that the measurement noise corrupting the experimental data is maximally dumped...|$|R
50|$|T-Stoff: High test {{peroxide}} equipment {{consists of}} a pipe which runs along the starboard beam of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> from the trunnion end to the halfway point. The pipe is fitted at the upper end to the triple valve assembly, consisting of two flow valves and a three-way valve. The triple valve assembly connects to two tanks, a large measuring tank and a smaller overflow tank. The measuring tank can be filled to the rocket's required amount of T-stoff, after which any excess flows down a stand pipe to the overflow tank. The measuring tank is fitted with a ventilation stud, which vents displaced air as the tank is filled. The ventilation stud includes a ball cock fixed to a frustum stopper, which blocks the vent stud in case of accidental overfilling so that T-Stoff does not spray from the air vent. Both T-Stoff tanks are fitted with an inspection window.|$|R
