5000|$|The computer, in 1993, was run via Speed Density, which {{measured}} {{engine speed}} (RPM) and <b>load</b> (<b>MAP</b> in kPa) to compute airflow requirements {{and then use}} that against the VE table to get the proper fueling for conditions. An IAT (Intake Air Temperature sensor) was also used as air density changes with temperature. In 1994 however, the computer logic was changed over to a Mass Air Flow system. This system uses a Mass Air Flow Sensor {{placed in front of}} the throttle body to measure the incoming airflow into the motor. This is measured by using a heated wire in the sensor in the airstream path which has heat pulled away from it via the incoming air. This reduced heat is converted into a voltage signal which is sent to the PCM which then converts that voltage signal into mass flow. The computer uses engine sensors to judge engine conditions and provide the proper fueling off of this mass airflow reading. This {{was one of the main}} differences between the 93 and 94+ F-Body cars (and 92-93 Vette's compared to 94-96) and one of the items that makes a 93 model unique. Another prominent difference between the [...] "Speed Density" [...] 93's and the 94+ cars is how the programming (or custom tuning) of the computer takes place. In 1993, the stock computer uses a Memcal chip, which is a removable chip from the computer. Contained in this chip is the program for the car to run. In the 1994+ cars, this was swapped to a non-removable reflashable chip, which could be reprogrammed via the Assembly Line Diagnostic Link, or ALDL, located underneath the driver side of the dash, next to the center console. Many people view this as a more user-friendly and easier way to tune the vehicle.|$|E

30|$|Quantifying {{wildland}} fire emissions {{is a critical}} step in evaluating smoke impacts. Smoke emissions estimates {{require the use of}} modeling pathways that combine multiple sources of data and the linking of scientific models in a logical, progressive sequence. Fire emissions are typically modeled using information on fire size and location, coupled with fuel <b>loading</b> <b>maps,</b> which are then processed through consumption models capable of producing emissions estimates. In a complex modeling process, numerous options are available, and managers, scientists, and others who model fire emissions need to understand the uncertainties and differences in this process. Intercomparisons, such as the one conducted here, provide insights into the sensitivity of smoke emissions estimates to the variability present at each step in a modeling pathway. Use of accurate fire information and local fuels data is critical to reducing the amount of uncertainty in the overall modeling chain. The first step to providing better estimates of smoke emissions is to provide better estimates of the fuels available to burn. Under-or over-estimating fire size can lead to inaccurate representations of the amount of fuel available to burn, the amount of fuel consumed during a fire, and subsequently unrepresentative estimates of smoke emissions. Additional uncertainty when modeling smoke emissions can be introduced by the available fuel <b>loading</b> <b>maps.</b> For example, we found that all modeled fuel <b>loading</b> <b>maps</b> studied underestimated total woody fuel loading when directly compared with field-sampled fuel loading data. Locally produced fuel <b>loading</b> <b>maps</b> such as the OkWen custom FCCS fuel <b>loading</b> <b>map</b> can reduce some of the uncertainty due to fuel loading inaccuracies; however, our results suggest that fuel loading, and subsequent smoke emissions, are commonly underestimated on wildfire in the Pacific Northwest. Examination of other fires as part of SEMIP (N. Larkin, unpublished data) shows similar results, suggesting that the uncertainties identified here are important areas for future research and development.|$|R

While this problem has been (partly) addressed early for the specific case of terrain rendering, there is no generic texture management system for arbitrary meshes. We propose such a system, implemented on today’s GPUs, which unifies classical solutions aimed at reducing memory transfer: progressive loading, texture compression, and caching strategies.

However, while this mechanism could be relevant in causing iron load in Thalassemia Intermedia and Sickle-Cell Anemia, its role in Thalassemia Major (TM) is marginal. This is mainly due to the high impact of transfusional requirement into the severe increase of body iron. Moreover, the damage of iron load may be worsened by infections, as HCV hepatitis, or liver and endocrinological damage. One of the most relevant associations was found between splenectomy and increase of risk for mortality due,probably, to more severe iron load.

40|$|It is {{expected}} that the global warming will reduce {{the frequency of the}} snow events. On the other hand, the intensity of extreme snow events may increase, since the capacity of the atmosphere to hold moisture increases with temperature. This may lead to the increase of both snow density and occurrence of extreme snowfalls in regions where temperatures still may happen to be below freezing level during precipitation events. To assess the evolution of the snow load and its impact on design of new buildings and on reliability of existing ones, a comparison of future trends, in both intensity and frequency of future precipitation in cold areas with current versions of snow load maps for structural design should be performed. The European Snow Loads Research Project was carried out under contracts with the European Commission DG III – D 3 in the period 1996 - 1999 with the aim to provide scientific basis for harmonized definition of models for determining the actions of snow applied to the structural parts of construction works. The project was led by Pisa University. The snow load design map produced by this project is incorporated in Annex C of EN 1991 - 1 - 3 with the aim to help National Competent Authorities to redraft their national snow maps and to establish harmonized procedures to produce such maps.

40|$|Research into fire ecology has {{culminated in}} ‘the patchiness paradigm’. This {{is the view}} that {{numerous}} small fires, with variety in fire timing, frequency and intensity, will lead to habitat diversity across the landscape, thereby benefiting species conservation. The paradigm recognises that fire is instrumental in shaping the Australian environment, and that no single fire regime will suit all species. As a result, land holders wanting to adopt ecologically sustainable fire management practices are advised to develop and maintain fine-grained landscape patchiness using fire. However, there is no guidance on optimal fire size, level of internal fire patchiness or desirable fire frequency. Having ill-defined objectives is incompatible with ‘adaptive management’, the approach espoused for managing {{in the face of}} inadequate information and uncertainty. Adaptive management, or learning by doing, requires clear management objectives and careful monitoring. When, how often, and how much should manager’s burn, and how should they evaluate success? Although adaptive management accommodates uncertainty, the scale and internal patchiness of proposed fire operations need to be articulated in order to commence the cycle with a ‘best guess’ management target. Addressing this issue and bridging the gap between ecological understanding and applied land management is the critical next step in fire ecology. This thesis focuses on this concern. The case study area was the Mount Isa Inlier, a semi-arid bioregion in northwest Queensland, Australia. The study concentrated on the fire ecology of spinifex/snappy gum woodlands, the dominant vegetation type in the bioregion. Remote sensing technology was used to examine landscape fire patterns and to identify key drivers of these patterns. Field surveys were undertaken to determine regenerative responses of the vegetation and to investigate spatial variability between and within fires. To investigate the potential effects on fauna, a fauna fire response database was compiled using expert opinion. Species were then classified according to their fire sensitivity based on species’ refugium requirements during a fire and vegetation maturation stage requirements after a fire. The predicted response of fauna was tested in the field using birds as a sub-group. The results were interpreted in terms of setting objectives for adaptive management, with recommendations on a target fire size and associated monitoring. The Mount Isa Inlier was found to have greater affinity with arid Australian landscapes than mesic savannas. Fire scars mapped over a six-year period (1998 - 2003) showed that the total area burnt per year was related to the strength of the preceding wet season. Post-fire changes in the vegetation were highly predictable. There was a flush of annual and ephemeral species after the first rain. The abundance of these species decreased over time, while the cover of perennial species increased. There was insufficient fuel for fire to spread {{for at least three years}} from the previous fire. By then, most ephemeral species have set seed, and perennial species have started to produce seeds. Resilience to fire was enhanced by the inherent variability within burnt areas. Vegetation at early recovery stages co-existed with patches of vegetation at later recovery stages. Mature plants in unburnt patches provide reproductive material that ensures individual species remain in the system. Collectively, these data provided an understanding of firemediated vegetation dynamics in spinifex/snappy gum communities. When the fire-sensitivity of fauna species was tested, birds relying on long unburnt spinifex during and after fire were more vulnerable than generalist species. Additional field studies were undertaken to investigate the internal fire-patchiness requirements of fire-sensitive species. The ideal characteristics for unburnt patches within fire scars could not be defined. Nonetheless the approach provided sufficient insight for a target fire size to be proposed. Restricting fire size to around 100 ha was considered acceptable to conserve birds in the bioregion. It is recommended that a suite of fire-sensitive species be used for ecological monitoring, based on the objective process used in this study. Fine-scale satellite imagery (IKONOS, 1 -m 2 – 4 -m 2 pixel resolution) was investigated as a tool for quantifying fire patchiness. If fuel load or fire severity could be mapped, this would provide the initial step. Mapping fuel loads at this scale would also give accurate and spatially explicit fire histories for different areas. This would benefit researchers interested in characterising fire regimes as it would allow for successive monitoring. Field data on fuel load and fire severity were compared to reflectance values recorded by the IKONOS satellite. A fuel <b>load</b> <b>map</b> was produced, but the inherent uncertainty in remote sensing processes meant that results were generalised to areas with high, medium or low fuel load. Although this can assist managers to identify areas of high fire hazard, its day-to-day use for monitoring fire patchiness is questionable. Mapping fire severity was not successful and remains the key fire regime variable not yet captured by remote sensing. The fine-scale mapping components of this study supported the notion that restricting fire size should be emphasised as a management goal in northwest Queensland. Internal fire-patchiness was inherent and difficult to specifically plan for. Fire size can be readily monitored using existing remote sensing techniques. The major contribution of this work is that it provides a way to mesh the patchiness paradigm with practical land management. By tailoring fire size to the needs of the most fire sensitive species, the remainder are likely to be catered for, by default. Fire-sensitive species can be identified by classifying species according to their requirements during, and immediately after, fire. The method tested here proved to be useful and can be applied in different environments and at different scales. This is one of the few studies that endeavours to quantify the level of patchiness to which managers might aspire. It demonstrates a strategic approach that integrates well with adaptive management. Thus, the findings provide a way to progress from setting management goals based on ecological principles, such as ‘a fine scale mosaic’, to setting more specific targets based on ecological understanding and a coherent process. Further, the thesis provides important information on the fire ecology of spinifex/snappy gum woodlands in the Mount Isa Inlier. Fire-related research is scant for this area, so this information provides a starting point for ecological fire management in the region...|$|E

The current generation of fuel <b>loading</b> <b>maps</b> (FCCS 2, OkWen, LANDFIRE FLM; McKenzie et al. 2007, Lutes et al. 2009, French et al. 2011) has become increasingly comprehensive since {{the creation of the}} NFDRS as a tool for fire danger rating (Burgan et al. 1997 a, Burgan et al. 1998). Much of the resulting variability in the mapped fuel loadings we observed was due to the omission of specific fuels strata such as canopy, shrubs, litter, or duff layers in the older fuel maps (NFDRS, Hardy 98). Use of the current generation of fuel <b>loading</b> <b>maps</b> resolves these issues, as these fuels maps were specifically created to model fuel consumption and smoke emissions and now include canopy fuels and improved modeling of litter and duff.|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} paper [Bellei, Gentile and Papola, 2002] we have {{proposed}} a new continuous implicit path formulation of Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA), where a user equilibrium is expressed as a fixed point problem in terms of arc flow temporal profiles. There, it is shown that, by extending to the dynamic case the concept of Network <b>Loading</b> <b>Map,</b> is no more needed to introduce th...|$|R
30|$|Fuel {{consumption}} modeling systems estimate {{fuel consumption}} {{on the level}} of tree stands (Reinhardt and Dickinson 2010). Spatial assessments of fuel consumption during a single large wildfire event can be estimated using the fuel <b>loading</b> <b>maps</b> discussed previously. In addition to total fuel consumption, a time profile estimate of fuel consumption by phase (flaming, smoldering, and residual) is also considered because the quantity and mixture of emissions varies by phase.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} the traffic emission computing, mapping and its monitoring in rela-tion to {{the system of the}} highway toll gates. The construction of an own mathematical model, built on secondarily used data variables of the toll gate system, is presented. The model construction allows describing a simple method for the estimation of traffic intensities and finally for modelling the emis-sion <b>load</b> <b>maps</b> of the mobile sources...|$|R
