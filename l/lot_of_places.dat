25|$|Today, Thebes is {{a bustling}} market town, {{known for its}} many {{products}} and wares. Until the 1980s, it had a flourishing agrarian production with some industrial complexes. However, during the late 1980s and 1990s the bulk of industry moved further south, closer to Athens. Tourism in the area is based mainly in Thebes and the surrounding villages, where a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>places</b> of interest related to antiquity exist such as the battlefield where the Battle of Plataea took place. The proximity to other, more famous travel destinations, like Athens and Chalkis, and the undeveloped archaeological sites have kept the tourist numbers low.|$|E

As Meyer recalled: [...] "I think in the end the feel was that we wound up using a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>places</b> or exteriors that just felt too Western and we didn't necessarily want to go that way; but at some point, it just became the lesser of two evils—what could we actually create in three days?" ...|$|E

O'Brien had the band members set up {{much as they do}} live, and most of the songs were developed out of jam sessions. Guitarist Stone Gossard said, [...] "I think we allowed things to develop in a more natural, band-oriented sort of way, rather than me bringing in a bunch of stuff that was already arranged." [...] Gossard added that most of the songs were arranged once Vedder joined in and started singing, elaborating, [...] "You could tell when the music wanted to change just by the way he was singing." [...] In a 2009 interview, Gossard stated, [...] " [...] was probably where it felt better recording wise. I saw how it could change and evolve which gave me a lot of inspiration to go we can do ballads, we can do fast stuff, we can do slow stuff, we can do punk stuff. That was where I realized there were gonna be a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>places</b> to go with Ed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nine Inch Nails' second {{full-length}} album, The Downward Spiral, {{entered the}} Billboard 200 chart in 1994 at number two, and remains the highest-selling Nine Inch Nails release in America. To record the album, Reznor rented {{and moved into}} the 10050 Cielo Drive mansion, where the 1969 Manson Family murders took place. He built a studio space in the house, which he renamed Le Pig, after the word that was scrawled {{on the front door}} in Sharon Tate's blood by her murderers. Reznor told Entertainment Weekly that, despite the notoriety attached to the house, he chose to record there because he [...] "looked at a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>places,</b> and this just happened to be the one I liked most". He has also explained that he was fascinated by the house due to his interest in [...] "American folklore," [...] but has stated that he does not [...] "want to support serial-killer bullshit." ...|$|E

[...] James Rocchi of The Wrap gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "As animated sci-fi for small fry, it's a success whose modest but well-executed ambitions are no small part of its charm." [...] Stephen Whitty gave the film two out of five stars, saying [...] "The Gummi-colored animation is imaginative, but director Tim Johnson's ho-hum 3D cartoon remains strictly 1D." [...] Rafer Guzman of Newsday gave the film two out of four stars, saying [...] "The film moves quickly and keeps the jokes coming, which only means that Home would rather keep young viewers occupied than give them something to think about." [...] Ben Sachs of the Chicago Reader gave the film a negative review, saying [...] "Aggressive and cynical approach to children's entertainment, pummeling viewers with mechanical-looking action sequences (which suggest video game demos), unfunny one-liners, and overly loud pop songs and sound effects." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film two out of five stars, saying [...] "Key characters are admirably diverse, but the fast-paced tale is thoroughly predictable." ...|$|E

2500|$|Vrelo Ibra ( [...] ; [...] ) is {{the spring}} of the River Ibar located in the {{north-east}} region of Montenegro in Rožaje. [...] It {{is one of the}} top natural landmarks in Rožaje. It is located 10km away from the city center on the northern side at the foot of the mountain Hajla in a dense conifer forest. Rožaje has a big amount of springs, but the strongest one is {{the spring of}} the river Ibar [...] which is also the longest Montenegrin river. The road to the spring has beautiful landscapes with a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>places</b> suitable for picnic or sport activities (such as mountain biking) or other recreation. The road which needs only to be followed to the spring is located in Suho Polje a few kilometers from the city center of Rožaje on Ibarska magistrala in the direction to Berane, on the left side over the bridge next to the hotel Aldi. The road to the Vrelo Ibra is suitable for going by foot or by any vehicle. The strongest recommendation of the turistic organization of Rožaje is to go with a bike. Near the spring is located the main turistic mountain house in Bandžov. The length of the road to Vrelo Ibra is 12km from the place Suho Polje in Rožaje. In the upper course of the river Ibar, which can be followed on the main road to the spring, can be found a lot of brown trout, and in the downstream part of the present chub, carp and whitefish. Vrelo Ibra is a very romantic place which potentials are still not fully valorized.|$|E
2500|$|Debney called Iron Man 2 [...] "odd in {{that there}} were not a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>places</b> where a true superhero theme could be played. Tony Stark is uber cool even as Iron Man, so, musically, we couldn’t state a {{full-blown}} superhero theme. The strains of Iron Man’s theme are heard only in a few spots by design. I’m hoping with future films, Iron Man might get his full-blown theme played aggressively." [...] For instance, Debney recorded several {{different versions of the}} score for scenes where Stark puts on the Iron Man suit, each with [...] "different portions of the theme fleshed out or left out". What was ultimately chosen [...] "was less thematic. It was sort of a groove {{with a little bit of}} French horn. Maybe that was the right choice, but it was a difficult decision. It was difficult to find the areas in the movie where we could let Tony be a superhero." [...] He continued, [...] "There were moments where I wanted to play a scene broadly or make a love scene out of it but we were never able to go there", such as for the end of the film where [...] "Tony finally kisses Pepper ... there were a couple of versions I did that were really gorgeous and lush but it just didn't fit. It's a different kind of movie because they kiss and then all of a sudden the mood is broken. It's just the nature of this character." [...] Debney felt that this process led to the score being [...] "watered down and mashed up a little bit" [...] from what he originally intended. However, Debney did not feel the same about his music for the villain, Ivan Vanko, which he described as a personal [...] "joy". He said that Favreau [...] "gave me a great opportunity to get into [...] scene and learn 's circumstances and to play sincerely sad music for him and the relationship he had with his father. Jon gave me the opportunity to morph that and turn it into something really dark and twisted. For me that was the most satisfactory part of the score and the film". For Vanko's theme, the choir sang in Russian to [...] "capture the dark Russian soul" [...] of the character.|$|E

6000|$|And {{now about}} Rupert. As I have said, {{he ran away}} {{when he was about}} fourteen, and we did not hear about him for years. When we--or, rather, my father--did hear of him, it was no good that he heard. He had gone as a cabin-boy on a sailing ship round the Horn. Then he joined an {{exploring}} party through the centre of Patagonia, and then another up in Alaska, and a third to the Aleutian Islands. After that he went through Central America, and then to Western Africa, the Pacific Islands, India, and a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>places.</b> We all know the wisdom of the adage that [...] "A rolling stone gathers no moss"; and certainly, if there be any value in moss, Cousin Rupert will die a poor man. Indeed, nothing will stand his idiotic, boastful wastefulness. Look at the way in which, when he came of age, he made over all his mother's little fortune to the MacSkelpie! I am sure that, though Uncle Roger made no comment to my father, who, as Head of our House, should, of course, have been informed, he was not pleased. My mother, who has a good fortune in her own right, and has had the sense to keep it in her own control--as I am to inherit it, and it is not in the entail, I am therefore quite impartial--I can approve of her spirited conduct in the matter. We never did think much of Rupert, anyhow; but now, since he is in the way to be a pauper, and therefore a dangerous nuisance, we look on him as quite an outsider. We know what he really is. For my own part, I loathe and despise him. Just now we are irritated with him, for we are all kept on tenterhooks regarding my dear Uncle Roger's Will. For Mr. Trent, the attorney who regulated my dear uncle's affairs and has possession of the Will, says it is necessary to know where every possible beneficiary is to be found before making the Will public, so we all have to wait. It is especially hard on me, who am the natural heir. It is very thoughtless indeed of Rupert to keep away like that. I wrote to old MacSkelpie about it, but he didn't seem to understand or to be at all anxious--he is not the heir! He said that probably Rupert Sent Leger--he, too, keeps to the old spelling--did not know of his uncle's death, or he would have taken steps to relieve our anxiety. Our anxiety, forsooth! We are not anxious; we only wish to know. And if we--and especially me--who have all the annoyance of thinking of the detestable and unfair death-duties, are anxious, we should be so. Well, anyhow, he'll get a properly bitter disappointment and set down when he does turn up and discovers that he is a pauper without hope! ...|$|E
