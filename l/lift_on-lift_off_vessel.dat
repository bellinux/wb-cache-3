A covered terminal was opened in 1997, initially built for steel handling for British Steel Corporation; the terminal was renamed Hull All-Weather Terminal in 2009, and the facilities expanded to allow the handling of other weather sensitive goods, including dry bulks, paper, and agribulks (fertiliser). A covered shed for paper products (Finland Terminal), opened in 2000, had by 2006 expanded to 70000 sq ft.|$|R

40|$|Capstone Design and Manufacturing Experience: Fall 2006 Monopolar {{surgical}} dissecting uses {{a pencil}} like device and electrical current {{to cut through}} fibrous tissue and seal <b>off</b> <b>vessels.</b> During surgery, heat is applied for coagulation, which creates collateral damage to adjacent nerves that are heat sensitive. This project is expected to develop a surgical thermal management system to protect the nerve from thermal damage during monopolar surgical dissecting in both open and laparoscopic procedures. Because of {{the widespread use of}} monopolar energy, a main goal of this thermal management system is to eliminate thermal damage to surrounding nerves, improving post-operation quality of life for patients...|$|R

25|$|The {{original}} strategic sealift vessel {{project was}} based on a proposal to acquire a converted Ro-Ro (Roll On - Roll <b>Off)</b> <b>vessel</b> from Japan as recommended by the Center of Naval Leadership & Excellence in 2009. Purchase and technical assistance was to be provided by the DBP Maritime Leasing Corporation Inc. (DMLC). It was one of the priority items in the wish list for purchase between 2012 and 2016 presented by the armed forces to the House of Representatives' committee on national defense and security on 26 January 2011. But this project did not push through due to delays in budget allocation and with the ship being offered and sold to another buyer.|$|R
50|$|Safety was a {{constant}} issue for steamboats. Some vessels, particularly the later steel-hulled ones, had perfect safety records.

In 1957, Fikentscher, Semm and three other physicians founded of the Deutsche Gesellschaft zum Studium der Fertilität und Sterilität, renamed Deutsche Gesellschaft für Reproduktionsmedizin in 1998. In the 1960s Semm started to use laparoscopy - he named it ‘’pelviscopy’’ - for gynecologic indications, initially as a diagnostic tool, but soon realizing that the laparoscopic approach had potential for interventive surgery. His experience as toolmaker let him to found the WISAP medical instrument company in 1959 allowing him to developed numerous instruments among them an automated electronic CO2 insufflator, uterine manipulators, thermocoagulators to stop bleeding, and extra- and intracorporeal endocopic knotting devices to tie <b>off</b> <b>vessels</b> or remove organs.|$|R
