40|$|The {{distribution}} of log counts {{at a given}} time during the exponential growth phase of Listeria innocua measured in food samples inoculated with one cell each was applied to estimate the {{distribution of}} the single-cell lag times. Three replicate experiments in broth showed that the distribution of the log counts is a linear mapping of the distribution of the detection times measured by optical density. The detection time distribution reflects the lag time distribution but is shifted in time. The log count distribution was applied to estimate the distributions of the lag times in a <b>liquid</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>product</b> and in liver paté after different heat treatments. Two batches of ca. 100 samples of the dairy product were inoculated and heated at 55 °C for 45 min or at 62 °C for 2 min, and an unheated batch was incubated at 4 °C. The final concentration of surviving bacteria was ca. 1 cell per sample. The unheated cells showed the shortest lag times with the smallest variance. The mean and the variance of the lag times of the surviving cells at 62 °C were greater than those of the cells treated at 55 °C. Three batches of paté samples were heated at 55 °C for 25 min, 62 °C for 81 s, or 65 °C for 20 s. A control batch was inoculated but not heated. All paté samples were incubated at 15 °C.

40|$|This degree {{project was}} carried out at Tetra Pak Research &amp;amp; Development AB in Lund, a unit within Tetra Pak with 250 employees. Tetra Pak develops, {{produces}} and markets complete processing, packaging and distribution systems within the food sector. Tetra Pak Research &amp;amp; Development AB is a unit that supports all business areas within Tetra Pak. In 2003, the unit started {{the development of a}} new package with specific characteristics. The package is a 1000 ml aseptic package, which packs milk for long shelf life. It is called PLDP – Package for <b>Liquid</b> <b>Dairy</b> <b>Product.</b> The main purpose of this study is to evaluate different measuring instruments and test methods concerning appearance aspects of the PLDP at Tetra Pak Research &amp;amp; Development AB. Furthermore, the purpose is to give recommendations on what actions need to be taken to work efficiently with the area of package appearance. To attain the purpose a case study with values, methodologies and tools from the Total Quality Management system was conducted. A range of operations was made to gain an understanding of the PLDP project and its connections to appearance aspects of the package. For instance, a careful mapping of the current way of working with appearance at Tetra Pak Research & Development AB was made. Moreover, a suggestion of an improved partition of the appearance of PLDP was made. This was the starting-point for the identification and prioritisation of practicable features for this study to continue with. Also it facilitated the evaluation regarding measuring instruments and test methods, by viewing the partition in a new and organised way. The features evaluated in this study are Bulging and Visual Damages. In addition, several interviews with strategically selected employees within Tetra Pak were conducted. These interviews formed a basis for defining the conception of Package Appearance, which the area is called. The definition of Package Appearance was crucial to help the author to keep the red thread throughout the entire study. The evaluation of Bulging and Visual Damages was made in different ways. First, available instruments to measure Bulging of the PLDP were listed. Two instruments were decided to go through a further investigation by means of a Measurement System Analysis (Gauge R&R). Such an analysis determines whether variation comes from the packages being measured, differences in operator measurements or the measuring instrument. The results show that a higher precision and a faster measuring procedure, almost without any influence of different operators can be obtained with a laser instrument. The second instrument to be analysed in a Measurement System Analysis was a calliper. According to Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), this instrument was not a proper measuring instrument for this purpose. However, a laser instrument and a calliper are associated with different costs and these need to be taken into account in an investment situation. The second feature, Visual Damages, was investigated by first determining which sub features to include in this feature. These sub features formed the input in the conduction of a test method consisting of photo references to compare with the actual defects of the packages. To reduce misconceptions when testing different features of a package, the author suggests working in accordance with such a method which puts references together of what is right and what is wrong among machine operators, laboratory personnel and project leader.

Related applications include some forms of mud flows and debris flows, pasty sewage sludges and some wastewater treatment residues. Thixotropy is the characteristic of a fluid to form a gelled structure over time when it is not subjected to shearing and to liquefy when agitated. A thixotropic fluid is a non-Newtonian fluid with a viscosity that is a function of both shear rate ∂V/∂y and instantaneous state(s) of structure of the material. Such a fluid exhibits a reversible time-dependent decrease in apparent viscosity under shear rate and a gradual recovery when the shear stress is removed.

40|$|Background/Objectives: Food portion sizes {{have been}} {{increasing}} in industrialized countries {{and this is}} thought {{to be one of the}} risk factors of overweight. France is also facing the development of adiposity, particularly in its child population, where overweight rates are rising faster than in adults. Given this background, the objectives of the present study were, for each food category, to describe dietary intake in French children aged 3 - 11 years, and to assess the relationship between childhood overweight and portion size, adjusting for dietary energy density, physical activity and sedentary behaviour. Subjects/Methods: A representative sample of 748 French children aged 3 - 11 years was taken from the 1998 - 1999 crosssectional French INCA 1 (Enquete Individuelle et Nationale sur les Consommations Alimentaires) food consumption survey. Dietary intake was assessed using a 7 -day food record. Portion sizes were estimated for 23 food categories. Weight and height, physical activity and sedentary behaviour were reported by parents or children in questionnaires. Results: In multivariate logistic regression adjusted models, overweight in children aged 3 - 6 years was positively correlated to portion sizes of croissant-like pastries and other sweetened pastries. Conversely, portion sizes of <b>liquid</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> were inversely associated with overweight in children aged 7 - 11 years.

Industrial egg products, obtained after egg breaking, recovery and pasteurisation {{of the internal}} egg components, are used {{in a wide range}} of food, including chilled egg- and milk-based food particularly susceptible to microbial spoilage due to their low cooking temperatures. One of the main bacteria involved in the spoilage of pasteurized egg and <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> belongs to the spore-former B. cereus group. Several members of this group may lead to food spoilage due to their enzymatic activities, even at low temperatures.

In order to consider more accurately the food spoilage issue at both optimal and low temperatures, this work proposes to characterize the enzymatic potential of a collection of 68 strains of the B. cereus group, coming from pasteurized liquid egg products collected in the French egg breaking industry at two consecutive seasons. An egg-based medium was designed, allowing the kinetic characterisation of bacterial lipases and proteases at optimal and refrigeration temperatures. The results contribute to further investigate a comprehensive bacterial collection that was already characterised for its cold adaptation, its ability to grow in whole egg at higher levels than in optimum laboratory medium, to colonize the industrial surfaces, and to induce phase, texture and colour shifts of whole egg.

Related applications include some forms of mud flows and debris flows, pasty sewage sludges and some wastewater treatment residues. Thixotropy is the characteristic of a fluid to form a gelled structure over time when it is not subjected to shearing and to liquefy when agitated. A thixotropic fluid is a non-Newtonian fluid with a viscosity that is a function of both shear rate y and instantaneous state(s) of structure of the material. Such a fluid exhibits a reversible time-dependent decrease in apparent viscosity under shear rate and a gradual recovery when the shear stress is removed. This report describes a basic study of dam break wave with thixotropic fluid. A dam break wave is a sudden release of a mass of fluid in a channel. This type of flows has not been studied to date with thixotropic fluid, despite its practical applications : e. g., mudflow release, concrete tests including L-Box and J-Ring for self-consolidating concrete testing, paint applications. Theoretical considerations were developed based upon a kinematic wave approximation of the Saint-Venant equations for a thixotropic fluid down a prismatic sloping channel. The thixotropic fluid model of COUSSOT et al. (2002 a) was used since it describes the instantaneous state of fluid structure by a single parameter. The analytical solution of the basic flow motion and rheology equations predict three basic flow regimes depending upon the fluid properties and flow conditions, including the initial degree of jamming of the fluid : (1) a short motion with relatively-rapid flow stoppage for relatively small mass of fluid, (2) a fast flow motion for a large mass of fluid, or (3) an intermediate motion initially rapid before final fluid stoppage for intermediate mass of fluid and intermediate initial rest period To. Physical experiments were performed with bentonite suspensions. Systematic experiments showed four types of flows. For small bentonite mass concentrations and short relaxation times To, the fluid flowed rapidly down the slope and spilled into the overflow container (Flow Type I). For intermediate concentrations and rest periods, the suspension flowed rapidly initially, decelerated relatively suddenly, continued to flow slowly for sometimes before complete stoppage (Flow Type II). For large mass concentrations and long rest periods, the mass of fluid stretched down the slope, until the head separated from the tail (Flow Type III). The last flow pattern (Type IV) corresponded to an absence of flow for large bentonite concentrations and long rest times. Quantitative informations were documented in terms of the final fluid thickness, wave front position, wave front curvature, side profile of the wave front during motion and after stoppage, as well as the flow motion immediately after gate opening. Some freesurface instabilities are also discussed and illustrated. It is believed that the present study is the first theoretical analysis combining successfully the basic principles of unsteady flow motion (i. e. Saint-Venant equations) with a thixotropic fluid model, which was validated with large-size systematic laboratory experiments. It is the belief of the writers that, for such complex systems this kind of approach, combining both rheology and fluid dynamics, is necessary to gain new insights of these complicated flow motions...|$|R

He {{testified to the}} disappearance of many ailments upon the exclusion of <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> He explained that pathogenic organisms find an ideal breeding ground in the excess mucus that <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> generate. He cited the following diseases as being aggravated or caused by mucus conditions in which <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> are the major offender: undulant fever, colds, flu, bronchial troubles, tuberculosis, asthma, hay fever, sinus trouble, pneumonia and certain types of arthritis.|$|R
40|$|Thai dairy {{industry}} is heavily intervened {{by the government}} and depended on a large proportion of <b>dairy</b> <b>product</b> imports. New Zealand and Australia are the most important suppliers to Thailand dairy import market. Both countries together contribute more than 50 percent to Thailand total dairy import market. In 2005, Thailand signed free trade agreements with Australia (Thailand-Australia Free Trade Agreement: TAFTA) and New Zealand (Thailand-New Zealand Closer Economic Partnership: THNZCEP). Both agreements include tariff liberalisation in <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> which directly affect Thai {{dairy industry}}. It is debatable whether both agreements create or divert resource allocation efficiency for Thailand dairy production. This study assessed the welfare impacts of the implementation of THNZCEP and TAFTA. The modified gravity model was employed to assess trade creation and trade diversion effects of both agreements in seven <b>dairy</b> <b>product</b> categories: non-concentrated milk and cream, concentrated milk and cream, buttermilk and yogurt, whey, butter, cheese and curd and total <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> The modified gravity model for each <b>dairy</b> <b>product</b> was estimated by pooling the data from 1991 :Q 1 - 2009 :Q 4 across Thailand top five trading partners using Time Series and Cross Sections (TSCS) estimation. In addition, the study employed the import price model to examine effects of the Thailand tariff reduction for New Zealand and Australian <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> on the prices of New Zealand and Australian <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> and the relative price of non-FTA member to New Zealand (Australian) <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> in Thailand market. The results show that the implementation of THNZCEP and TAFTA leads to net positive trade creation in most <b>dairy</b> <b>product</b> categories which indicates their members’ welfare improvement, except in whey for THNZCEP and concentrated milk and cream for TAFTA. In addition, it is found that the reduction in tariffs for <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> from New Zealand and Australia has negligible effects on the Thailand import prices of <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> from both countries while other factors such as exchange rate, competitor price, and drought have significantly larger effects. Furthermore, the reduction in tariffs for <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> from New Zealand and Australia significantly increases the ratio of non-FTA member to New Zealand (Australian) prices in some <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> in Thailand market. This finding indicates that the <b>dairy</b> <b>product</b> prices of non-FTA members are relatively high in Thailand market after the implementation of THNZCEP and TAFTA...|$|R
40|$|China {{has been}} rapidly {{increasing}} its consumption and imports of <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> in recent years. A two-stage demand system was estimated for livestock product consumption in urban China over the 1990 s. Total expenditure elasticities for the livestock commodity group and expenditure elasticities for <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> within the livestock commodity group were calculated. The {{results suggest that}} <b>dairy</b> <b>products,</b> even in urban areas, remain luxury goods because of a high expenditure elasticity (1. 26). Due to rapidly increasing consumption {{and the likelihood of}} inadequate supply growth, China will continue to increase its imports of <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> to meet its domestic demand. Projections imply that China’s imports of <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> may approach 30 percent of its total domestic consumption by 2005. Due to differences in regional income and population growth rates, increases in <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> consumption may occur especially in central and coastal areas, where potential trade opportunities may exist. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{estimate}} {{the consumption of}} <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> in the Brazilian population. Methods: Data from two non-consecutive food records from 34, 003 individuals (aged ³ 10 years) in the first Brazilian nationally representative dietary survey (2008 - 2009) were used to {{estimate the}} <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> intake. <b>Dairy</b> <b>products</b> were divided into four major subgroups: cow's milk, cheese, yogurt and other <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> Absolute and relative frequencies of individuals in the population who reported consumption of <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> {{in at least one}} of the two-day food record according to sex, age, geographic region and levels of per capita monthly family income were calculated. Moreover, the mean consumption of <b>dairy</b> <b>products,</b> as well as their nutritional contribution in total energy, protein, calcium, phosphorus and magnesium intake was estimated. Results: It was observed that only 43. 0 % of the population reported consuming <b>dairy</b> <b>products,</b> being the milk subgroup the most frequently consumed (21. 1 %). The prevalence of consumption was higher among females, elderly, residents of the South region, and among individuals from higher per capita monthly family income. The nutritional contribution of <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> was less than 10. 0 % of total energy intake and for most nutrients and the mean daily consumption are justified was 101. 8 g. Conclusion: Therefore, in view of the low intake of <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> by Brazilian population and the nutritional benefits associated with this food group, public health strategies to increase dairy consumption are justified...|$|R
