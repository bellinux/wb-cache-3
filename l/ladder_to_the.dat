5|$|There is a clifftop {{walk from}} Jacob's Ladder along {{the crest of}} the gorge and back to the road, with views of the gorge. A caving {{experience}} is offered within Gough's Cave. There is a path of 275steps, built {{up the side of the}} gorge, known as Jacob's Ladder after the Biblical description of a <b>ladder</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heavens. A watchtower at the top provides a 360–degree view of the entire area and village. An open-top bus tour operates during the summer. Cheddar cheese is made in the lower part of the gorge.|$|E
5|$|While {{working on}} an oil rig, Lenny and Homer accidentally set fire to an ant, who in turn sets fire to all her ant companions, who jump in a puddle of oil to {{extinguish}} the flames. Their brief sighs of relief are replaced with screams as the whole rig catches fire. Marge goes with Artie along with Carl to West Springfield to save Homer and Lenny. At first, they are reluctant, as Homer still thinks that Marge and Artie are having an affair, and Lenny feels {{that there is nothing}} for him in Artie's helicopter. However, Artie finally admits defeat to Homer, saying that winning Marge's love was something that he could never accomplish, even with his billions, and Homer jumps on the <b>ladder</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> helicopter. Carl reveals that he is in the helicopter, and Lenny also jumps on to be saved, just before the rig collapses. Homer and Marge's marriage is also apparently saved when Artie offers a solution to Homer's snoring problem, a device which converts snoring to music. However, Artie's voice is soon heard through the device's speaker, giving Marge anti-Homer subliminal messages and eventually saying that he is watching her through a camera.|$|E
5|$|For the Ladder match, the Intercontinental belts {{belonging}} to Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels were both hanging above the ring, {{and the first}} wrestler to use the ladder to reach both belts would be declared the winner. Ramon began the match by chokeslamming Michaels. Michaels recovered, however, and performed a neckbreaker on Ramon. Michaels then threw Ramon out to the ringside, where Michaels' bodyguard Diesel clotheslined Ramon. Referee Earl Hebner responded by ordering Diesel {{to return to the}} dressing rooms. Ramon pulled up the padding from the concrete floor, but he was later thrown onto it after Michaels reversed Ramon's attempt to perform the Razor's Edge. While Ramon was lying on the floor, Michaels brought the <b>ladder</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ring and used it to hit Ramon in the stomach, chest and back. Michaels tried to retrieve the belts, but Ramon stopped him from climbing the ladder. Michaels then set the ladder up {{in the corner of the}} ring and performed a splash onto Ramon. Ramon recovered and Irish whipped Michaels into the ladder. He then hit Michaels with the ladder several times before both men tried to climb up to get the belts. Ramon suplexed Michaels off the ladder and tried to reach the belts. Michaels dropkicked the ladder, which caused Ramon to fall off. Michaels performed a superkick and a piledriver on Ramon and then propped the ladder up in the corner of the ring. Michaels climbed the turnbuckles, jumped onto the ladder, and used his weight to push it down across Ramon's chest. Michaels tried to retrieve the belts again, but Ramon pushed him off. Michaels fell into the ropes and got tangled up, allowing Ramon to get the belts and win the undisputed Intercontinental championship.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after losing}} the Atómicos Championship Charly Manson left Los Vatos Locos to create his own stable called the Black Family. The Black Family {{initially}} featured Chessman, Escoria and Cuervo and was soon joined by Ozz, all of whom shared Manson's Goth-inspired look. On March 30, 2001 Manson suffered a career threatening injury that almost took his life. during a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match Manson was pushed off a <b>ladder</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> floor. The plan {{was that he would}} have his fall broken by a stack of tables but unfortunately the tables were not close enough and Manson dropped directly onto the concrete floor. The impact broke his femur and gave him a hard blow to the head. The Femur had to be strengthened by a surgical steel plate. In late 2001 Charly Manson returned to the promotion, while still not fully recovered, and began a war of words with the Black Family as Chessman had taken over his leadership role in Manson's absence. Manson displayed a much more cautious ring style upon his return.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} bout was {{the last}} match in the Terri Invitational Tournament, contested between The New Brood (Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy) and Edge and Christian in a tag team ladder match. For the match, a bag with 100,000 dollars was hung from the ceiling, and {{the goal of the}} match was to use one of the two ladders in the ring to climb and retrieve the bag. The first team to retrieve the bag would win the match. The manager of The New Brood, Gangrel brought a <b>ladder</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ring, but as a result, he got ejected from ringside by the referee. During the match, the ladders were set up so that one was on top of the other, resembling a Seesaw, Jeff jumped on one side so that the other side jutted upwards, knocking down both Matt and Christian. Later in the match, all four men were on the ladders and after Edge pushed Matt off of the ladder they were both on, he fell into the other ladder, knocking Christian to the mat. Jeff however, jumped onto the other ladder to continue to battle with Edge. As Jeff and Edge climbed the ladder, Jeff pushed Edge to the ground and grabbed the bag of money to win the match. As a result of winning the match, The New Brood won $100,000 and the managerial services of Terri Runnels. Backstage, the trio celebrated the win and their new partnership with a bottle of champagne.|$|E

The team then added their first round of foreign players Felix Aboagye and James Dissiramah. The club then began their grassroots project in November 2007 with Aqueel Ansari being the head coach. Mumbai FC then participated in their first tournament, the Mumbai Football League Elite Division in 2007. Mumbai FC lost their match in the Mumbai Football League to RCF 2–1 with Dane Pereira scoring the first goal. Mumbai FC then won the first match in their history against Bengal Mumbai; in their second match, won 7–0 with Abhishek Yadav scoring four goals.
