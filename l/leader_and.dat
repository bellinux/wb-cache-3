5|$|While the {{committees}} are established by formal Senate rules, {{there are a}} number of caucuses that exercise significant influence over the legislative process. The most powerful of these are the Democratic Caucus and the Republican Caucus, each of which has a <b>leader</b> <b>and</b> a whip, referred to as a majority and minority <b>leader</b> <b>and</b> whip. As Democrats currently control a majority of seats in the Senate, their leader is referred to as the Majority <b>Leader,</b> <b>and</b> their caucus is able to influence legislation to a greater extent than the Republican caucus. The Majority <b>Leader</b> <b>and</b> Minority leader are responsible for managing their party's participation in debate on the floor. Party caucuses also raise and distribute campaign money to assist their candidates. The Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland and Women Legislators of Maryland, caucuses of African-American and female Senators respectively, also play prominent roles in the Senate.|$|E

Because survey results for <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> nonleaders differed, results could not be combined into a sin-gle data set for analysis.

A 44 -item, six-factor scale resulted for <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> a 38 -item, five-factor scale resulted for nonleaders. The high degree of overlap (22 items) between the two scales resulted in a combined 60 -item instrument that can be administered to both <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> nonleaders but analyzed separately...|$|R
40|$|Political <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> poets are {{important}} figures of societies.

Tribal <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> poets have high-status. However, the principles of Islam took the various privileges of the Arab political <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> poets from their hands. Therefore, first strongest reactions to the Prophet’s message were given by the political <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> poets. The Qur’an and the Prophet took various measures and respond to them. Over time, the position and value of both <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> poets have been revealed with their true nature in terms of Islam.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the prominence of}} 'traditional' <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> institutions in the Somaliland's "success-story" of political reconstruction after a violent conflict. Can the Somaliland experience be replicated {{and serve as a}} model for other cases of problematic statehood? Through an analysis of the Somaliland case, the article shows that one can not simply 'use' traditional <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> institutions. They are not a-political entities or concepts. They are adaptable and have a dynamic of their own. The 'traditional' order is profoundly connected with 'non-traditional' orders i. e. 'modern' political <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> institutions. How both develop and interact is contingent upon an aggregate of factors which develop over a long period of time. This set of factors include so-called 'structural' ones as well as ones that are more 'agency'-related. This aggregation of factors makes the Somaliland experience difficult to replicate. 'Traditional' <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> institutions are not magic bullets, not a onefits-all in cases of problematic statehood. They should not be viewed as a-political components of some 'appropriate governance technology' that will provide <b>leaders</b> <b>and</b> institutions supposedly adapted to a timeless 'African situation and culture'...|$|R
