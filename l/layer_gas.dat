50|$|Ion <b>layer</b> <b>gas</b> {{reaction}} (ILGAR®) is a non-vacuum, thin-film deposition technique {{developed and}} patented {{by the group}} of Professor Dr. Christian-Herbert Fischer at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin for materials and energy in Berlin, Germany. It is a sequential and cyclic process that enables the deposition of semiconductor thin films, mainly for (although not restricted to) photovoltaic applications, specially chalcopyrite absorber layers and buffer layers. The ILGAR technique was awarded as German High Tech Champion 2011 by the Fraunhofer Society.|$|E
50|$|In MOCVD, group III alkyls {{are already}} {{partially}} dissociated {{in the gas}} stream. These diffuse through a stagnant boundary layer that exists over the heated substrate, after which they dissociate into the atomic group III elements. These atoms then migrate to the appropriate lattice site and deposit epitaxially by associating with a group V atom that {{was derived from the}} thermal decomposition of the hydrides. The growth rate here is usually limited by the diffusion rate of the group III alkyls through the boundary <b>layer.</b> <b>Gas</b> phase reactions between the reactants have also been observed in this process.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn the Yingdong Oil/Gas Field of the Qaidam Basin, {{multiple}} suites of oil-gas-water systems overlie {{each other}} vertically, {{making it difficult}} to accurately identify oil <b>layers</b> from <b>gas</b> <b>layers</b> and calculate gas-oil ratio (GOR). Therefore, formation testing and production data, together with conventional logging, NMR and mud logging data were integrated to quantitatively calculate GOR. To tell oil <b>layers</b> from <b>gas</b> <b>layers,</b> conventional logging makes use of the excavation effect of compensated neutron log, NMR makes use of the different relaxation mechanisms of light oil and natural gas in large pores, while mud logging makes use of star chart of gas components established based on available charts and mathematical statistics. In terms of the quantitative calculation of GOR, the area ratio of the star chart of gas components was first used in GOR calculation. The study shows that: (1) conventional logging data has a modest performance in distinguishing oil <b>layers</b> from <b>gas</b> <b>layers</b> due to the impacts of formation pressure, hydrogen index (HI), shale content, borehole conditions and invasion of drilling mud; (2) NMR is quite effective in telling oil <b>layers</b> from <b>gas</b> <b>layers,</b> but cannot be widely used due to its high cost; (3) by contrast, the star chart of gas components is the most effective in differentiating oil <b>layers</b> from <b>gas</b> layers; and (4) the GOR calculated by using the area ratio of star chart has been verified by various data such as formation testing data, production data and liquid production profile...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In oil {{production}} engineering, <b>layered</b> <b>gas</b> production {{is an important}} mining technology. While the interlayer pressure of natural gas well differs big, the interlayer interference forms. It is difficult to exploit the low pressure layer and control the high pressure layer. Developing a technical pipe string with integrating <b>layered</b> <b>gas</b> production can solve the above problems. This technical pipe string changes throttling area by striking, solves the conflicts between each layer, mines each layer uniformly and enhances recovery. It applied to Tai 4 - 28 gas well in Sebei-gas-field which is located in east of Qaidam basin perfects the 4 th department of shallow layer well pattern, forms new capacity, controls each layer pressure and capacity smoothly, protects the reservoirs effectively, achieves good effect in practice...|$|R
5000|$|The {{ablative}} {{heat shield}} functions by lifting the hot shock <b>layer</b> <b>gas</b> {{away from the}} heat shield's outer wall (creating a cooler boundary layer). The boundary layer comes from blowing of gaseous reaction products from the heat shield material and provides protection against all forms of heat flux. The overall process of reducing the heat flux experienced by the heat shield's outer wall {{by way of a}} boundary layer is called blockage. Ablation occurs at two levels in an ablative TPS: the outer surface of the TPS material chars, melts, and sublimes, while the bulk of the TPS material undergoes pyrolysis and expels product gases. The gas produced by pyrolysis is what drives blowing and causes blockage of convective and catalytic heat flux. Pyrolysis can be measured in real time using thermogravimetric analysis, so that the ablative performance can be evaluated. [...] Ablation can also provide blockage against radiative heat flux by introducing carbon into the shock layer thus making it optically opaque. Radiative heat flux blockage was the primary thermal protection mechanism of the Galileo Probe TPS material (carbon phenolic). Carbon phenolic was originally developed as a rocket nozzle throat material (used in the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster) and for re-entry vehicle nose tips.|$|E
50|$|An {{equilibrium}} real-gas model {{assumes that}} a gas is chemically reactive, but also assumes all chemical reactions have {{had time to}} complete and all components of the gas have the same temperature (this is called thermodynamic equilibrium). When air is processed by a shock wave, it is superheated by compression and chemically dissociates through many different reactions. Direct friction upon the reentry object is not the main cause of shock-layer heating. It is caused mainly from isentropic heating of the air molecules within the compression wave. Friction based entropy increases of the molecules within the wave also account for some heating. The distance from the shock wave to the stagnation point on the entry vehicle's leading edge is called shock wave stand off. An approximate rule of thumb for shock wave standoff distance is 0.14 times the nose radius. One can estimate the time of travel for a gas molecule from the shock wave to the stagnation point by assuming a free stream velocity of 7.8 km/s and a nose radius of 1 meter, i.e., time of travel is about 18 microseconds. This is roughly the time required for shock-wave-initiated chemical dissociation to approach chemical equilibrium in a shock layer for a 7.8 km/s entry into air during peak heat flux. Consequently, as air approaches the entry vehicle's stagnation point, the air effectively reaches chemical equilibrium thus enabling an equilibrium model to be usable. For this case, most of the shock layer between the shock wave and leading edge of an entry vehicle is chemically reacting and not in a state of equilibrium. The , which is of extreme importance towards modeling heat flux, owes its validity to the stagnation point being in chemical equilibrium. The time required for the shock <b>layer</b> <b>gas</b> to reach equilibrium is strongly dependent upon the shock layer's pressure. For example, {{in the case of the}} Galileo Probe's entry into Jupiter's atmosphere, the shock layer was mostly in equilibrium during peak heat flux due to the very high pressures experienced (this is counterintuitive given the free stream velocity was 39 km/s during peak heat flux).|$|E

40|$|Analytic {{results are}} derived for the {{apparent}} slip length, {{the change in}} drag and the optimum air layer thickness of laminar channel and pipe flow over an idealised superhydrophobic surface, i. e.  a <b>gas</b> <b>layer</b> of constant thickness retained on a wall. For a simple Couette flow the <b>gas</b> <b>layer</b> always has a drag reducing effect, and the apparent slip length is positive, assuming {{that there is a}} favourable viscosity contrast between liquid and gas. In pressure-driven pipe and channel flow blockage limits the drag reduction caused by the lubricating effects of the gas layer; thus an optimum <b>gas</b> <b>layer</b> thickness can be derived. The values for the change in drag and the apparent slip length are strongly affected by the assumptions made for the flow in the gas phase. The standard assumptions of a constant shear rate in the <b>gas</b> <b>layer</b> or an equal pressure gradient in the <b>gas</b> <b>layer</b> and liquid layer give considerably higher values for the drag reduction and the apparent slip length than an alternative assumption of a vanishing mass flow rate in the <b>gas</b> <b>layer.</b> Similarly, a minimum viscosity contrast of four must be exceeded to achieve drag reduction under the zero mass flow rate assumption whereas the drag can be reduced for a viscosity contrast greater than unity under the conventional assumptions. Thus, traditional formulae from lubrication theory lead to an overestimation of the optimum slip length and drag reduction when applied to superhydrophobic surfaces, where the gas is trapped...|$|R
