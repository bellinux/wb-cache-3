40|$|The article aims at {{examining}} how {{the main character}} Snowman’s image is constructed by applying an abundant number of deictic expressions in the Lithuanian, Russian and English versions of the cartoon Snow Postman. The research was based on M. Consten’s conception of direct and indirect reference and the model of visual-verbal cohesion proposed by N. Baumgarten. The study has revealed that in both, Russian and <b>Lithuanian</b> <b>versions</b> of the cartoon, the main character’s dialogues are loaded with deictic expressions which mark the same referents. In this way, the main character is shaped as a dull, forgetful being, unable to store and process {{a huge amount of}} information in his head. In the English version, deictic instances are sparsely used, thus the character image is quite different here: the snowman is less absent-minded and fuzzy...|$|R

The aim of our research is to evaluate the effect of retrospectively perceived parental bonding on adult resilience and its change in adulthood; we aim to study parental care, authoritarianism and behavioral control as the dimensions of parental bonding. A total of 745 adults from 18 to 81 years of age (M= 44. 54, SD= 17. 96) completed <b>Lithuanian</b> <b>versions</b> of the abbreviated Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI) and the 14 -Item Resilience Scale (RS- 14).

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to analyse Apple and Microsoft {{websites}} localised into Lithuanian. In order to achieve the aim, the following objectives have been set: 1. To overview the theoretical issues related to localisation in general and website localisation in particular; 2. To compose the scheme which would fit to the empirical analysis of the localised websites; 3. To analyse and compare <b>Lithuanian</b> and English <b>versions</b> of Apple and Microsoft websites. The object of this thesis is two localised IT websites (Apple and Microsoft). The material for the empirical part of this research is taken from IT websites: Apple and Microsoft. <b>Lithuanian</b> <b>versions</b> of these websites will be analysed in order to compare how these IT websites are localised into the Lithuanian language. The scope of the research is 495 screenshots: 289 cases are selected from the Apple website and 206 cases from the Microsoft website. The selected screenshots have been classified according to 3 major layers (the media environment, the textual environment, textuality) and eight elements of the website localisation: the cultural layer, the social and communicational layer, the graphic and iconic representation layer, the semantic layer, the grammatical layer, the technological infrastructure layer, hypertext and moving illustrations. The structure of this research includes introduction, the body consisting of theoretical and empirical parts, conclusions, list of references, websites and appendices. The introduction presents the aim, the objectives, the object and the methods of research.

40|$|Tikslas: sukurti Lietuvoje gyvenančių žmonių duomenų bazę antropologiniams genetiniams tyrimams atlikti ir išanalizuoti seksualumo ryšį su genais bei hormonais. Išvados: 1) Panaudojant dvigubą (iš anglų į rusų ir atgal iš rusų į anglų) vertimo metodą drauge su ekspertų vertinimu, buvo sukurtas tikslus ir suprantamas rusakalbiams EVAVT SFK. 2) Rusiška EVAVT SFK versija buvo patikrinta ir patvirtinta, ištyrus įvairius seksualinės funkcijos aspektus 122 vyrams, sergantiems 1 -o tipo cukriniu diabetu, palyginus su 81 sveiku vyru (abiejų grupių vyrų amžius buvo 26 - 36 metai). 3) Rusiška EVAVT SFK versija yra naujausias šiuolaikinis vyrų seksualinių funkcijų tyrimo instrumentas vyrų seksualinės veiklos ypatumų tyrimams (alfa Cronbach αst = 0, 8). The male {{sexuality}} {{should be}} assessed using the native language instruments to improve patients’ answer quality. The European Male Ageing Study (EMAS) Sexual Functioning Questionnaire (SFQ) {{was translated into}} Russian and Ukrainian languages in addition to <b>Lithuanian</b> and Polish <b>versions</b> previously available. Translation – back translation work together with expert evaluation resulted in optimal Russian and Ukrainian versions of EMAS-SFQ. Specialists’ evaluation of the Department of International Cooperation of Federal State Budget Ministry of Healthcare of the Russian Federation confirmed the accuracy and high quality of the translation of the questionnaire. The male sexual function {{of a group of}} 26 - 36 -year-old patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T 1 D) compares with earlier published results of the sexual function of healthy men (HM) from a general population. We correlated the sexual activity of men older than 40 years from the EMAS using the SFQ and 122 T 1 D patients with variable duration of disease. Eighty-one 26 – 36 -year-aged participants in the project “The reproductive function of Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian Young men (2003 - 2004) ” were recaptured from the list of participants in a 2003 - 2004 study and completed EMAS – SFQ. Their anthropometric characteristics, scores of sexuality (22 parameters from EMAS – SFQ, 3 calculated parameters and 2 parameters consisting of answers to the only question - masturbation and erectile function for each participant) were analysed, in conjunction with anthropometric, sperm quality and hormone levels of 2003 - 2004 18 – 25 -year-old general population. Results of HM of 26 - 36 -year-old were found to be comparable with EMAS 40 - 49 -year-old men. Results of T 1 D of 26 - 36 -year-old were similar to the EMAS 50 - 59 -year-old men. The masturbatory activity of all HM was statistically higher than in all T 1 D males (p< 0. 05), with p< 0. 01 difference comparing T 1 D during {{the first five years of}} diagnosed disease. Sexual function distress was higher in T 1 D men regardless of their duration of illness. Adverse changes in sexual functioning during one year in T 1 D men were significantly more pronounced when compared with HM and EMAS 40 - 49 -year-old men. A low incidence of erectile dysfunction was evident when comparing HM with all the other investigated groups. Our study confirms that the EMAS-SFQ is a sensitive instrument for the identification of early changes in male sexuality. Multiple parameters of EMAS-SFQ play an advantageous role, but the use of single items (masturbatory activity and erectile disorders) may be equally important. The masturbatory activity of T 1 D men is lower compared to HM even in the first years of diabetes onset...|$|R
