500|$|In July 2015, Greg Berlanti, {{creator and}} {{executive}} producer on both series, said: We've just been breaking into it over the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> so actually ... so we're, really, excited about it. We've got a great story lined up for {{towards the end of}} the fall, early winter. This year our real hope is to make a crossover that's even bigger, and even more rewarding for the audience than the last years. The scripts for the [...] "Heroes Join Forces" [...] crossover were written in September 2015. Berlanti created the story for the event, and Kreisberg and Guggenheim helped to craft the story of The Flash and Arrow episodes, respectively. The teleplay for The Flash was written by showrunners Aaron and Todd Helbing; Arrows was written by Brian Ford Sullivan and Guggenheim.|$|E
500|$|Buddy TV {{senior writer}} Oscar Dahl remarked, [...] "It didn't {{make me laugh}} out loud and, yet, I still loved it." [...] He shed a {{negative}} light on Andy's behavior towards Dwight, calling it [...] "annoying and not that funny." [...] Dahl hoped Dwight would be reappearing soon, and concluded [...] "Overall, a crucial story episode with a nice cliffhanger. Even if wasn't as funny as <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> even most episodes this season, The Office still entertains." [...] AOL TV's Michael Sciannamea lauded the episode, writing [...] "I cannot remember ever guffawing over every single line in a single sitcom episode as I did watching this one. If the performances in this particular one don't garner the actors in this show a plethora of Emmys, {{there ought to be}} an investigation." [...] Sciannamea continued that he believed it was Steve Carell's best series performance thus far because he [...] "displayed the full range of his personality—jokester, arrogant jerk, charming salesman, sensitive soul, and added a new one—anger." ...|$|E
500|$|Jeremy Egner of The New York Times {{wrote in}} his review of the episode; [...] "As with many epic sagas, the story and action in “Game of Thrones” are driven largely by {{characters}} moving toward and eventually becoming the people {{they are supposed to}} be. While we tend to focus on the big-ticket destinies, whether it’s Daenerys Targaryen emerging triumphantly from the flames <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> Jon Snow rising from the dead to fight again, the smaller figures have their own slots to fill." [...] James Hunt of What Culture noted, [...] "The Door ... delivered not only the best episode of the season to date, but one that is likely to go down as an all-time favourite." [...] Tim Surette of TV.com {{wrote in his}} review, [...] "The Door was BRUTAL in its final minutes, and you're still crying over it, admit it." [...] Lauren O'Callaghan of SFX Magazine wrote in her review, [...] "The Door, was the midseason episode. No way we were getting through that without taking some serious damage to our delicate hope-filled hearts." [...] She gave the episode a 4.5 out of 5.|$|E

50|$|Medicine {{has changed}} and {{developed}} beyond recognition over the centuries. After World War II, fundamental research became an increasingly important task of Leiden University’s Faculty of Medicine. The Biomedical Science study programme {{is an expression of}} this.

2500|$|On 16 October 2015 Oldfield tweeted, via his {{official}} Twitter account [...] "I am continuing {{to work on}} ideas for [...] "A New Ommadawn" [...] for the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> so to see if [...] the idea actually works." [...] On 8 May 2016, Oldfield announced via his Facebook group page that the new Ommadawn project with the tentative title of Return to Ommadawn is finished, and he is awaiting a release date from the record company. He also suggested that he may soon be starting work on a possible fourth Tubular Bells album.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1995, {{there was}} a {{leadership}} election for the Conservative Party, in which Major resigned {{as leader of the}} party and stood in the election. Powell wrote, [...] "He says to the Sovereign: I no longer am leader of the majority party in the House of Commons; but I am carrying on as your Prime Minister. Now I don't think anybody can say that—at least without inflicting damage on the constitution". To seek to offer advice to the Queen whilst unable to feel they could command a majority in the Commons was [...] "tantamount to treating the monarch herself with disrespect and denying the very principle in which our parliamentary democracy is founded". After Major's challenger, John Redwood, was defeated, Powell wrote to him, [...] "Dear Redwood, you will never regret the events of the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> two. Patience will evidently have to be exercised—and patience is the greatest of the political virtues—by those of us who want to keep Britain independent and self-governed".|$|E

40|$|Faults at {{subduction}} zones—regions {{where one}} tectonic plate dives beneath another—generate the world 2 ̆ 7 s largest earthquakes, which rapidly release strain over {{large areas of}} the plate interface. In recent years, a much slower form of strain release has been detected in many subduction zones throughout the world. It involves episodes of fault slip that resemble conventional earthquakes, except that faulting occurs slowly, often <b>lasting</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> months...|$|R

5000|$|After {{a vessel}} has been floated (in {{contemporary}} shipbuilding) or launched (in traditional shipbuilding), {{it is then}} towed out of its drydock and moored at a fitting-out berth. While still afloat, its construction is then continued. Depending {{on the type of}} vessel, fitting-out can <b>last</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> many months. Vessels with comparatively little space for human occupation, such as oil tankers, bulk carriers and container ships, can take the least time for fitting. Conversely, passenger ships take the longest. The process can include: ...|$|R
50|$|Prior to December 2010, WGMU-CA {{experienced}} {{long term}} black outs (i.e. dead air; static/snow), <b>lasting</b> several <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> months, and only broadcast sporadically. There {{had been no}} signal since, with the station now silent.|$|R

500|$|Boone {{supported}} his growing family {{in these years}} as a market hunter and trapper, collecting pelts for the fur trade. Almost every autumn, Boone would go on [...] "long hunts", extended expeditions into the wilderness <b>lasting</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> months. Boone went alone or {{with a small group}} of men, accumulating hundreds of deer skins in the autumn, and trapping beaver and otter over the winter. The hunt followed a network of bison migration trails, known as the Medicine Trails. When the long hunters returned in the spring, they sold their take to commercial fur traders.|$|R

50|$|Apart {{from various}} sieges, {{during the early}} part of the {{conflict}} Erard and his rebel barons attacked merchant caravans traveling to the Champagne fairs at Troyes and Bar-sur-Aube. However, each side soon realized that they did not want to disrupt this vital source of monetary income. During the later years of the war, therefore, Erard would agree to truces with Blanche that would <b>last</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> months at a time, in order for the trade fairs to occur unmolested. In return, Blanche would pay off Erard with a large fraction of the revenue from the comital taxes exacted from the trade fairs.|$|R
50|$|Adult D. opalescens {{move off}} the {{continental}} shelf {{by day and}} can be found to depths of 500 m. Adult shoals return to the surface at night to hunt. At some point these shoals move on shore to spawn where aggregations can reach million of individuals. Originally it was thought that the adults died after spawning, as the egg beds were often littered with dead squid. Now there is debate as to how long adults live after their first egg deposition and whether they can spawn repeatedly over the <b>last</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> months of their lives.|$|R
