5|$|The {{last four}} wheeled open wagons {{were built in}} 1958, but were not {{scrapped}} in large numbers until the 1980s when new bogie wagons replaced them. In 1987 the bogie wagon fleet numbered 5000, with approximately 700 grain hoppers, 800 container flats, 1000 <b>louvred</b> vans, 700 open wagons, 400 tank cars, and 300 flat wagons. Today the broad gauge intrastate fleet numbers 2600, {{with large numbers of}} <b>louvred</b> vans, open and flat wagons, and tank cars stored or scrapped due to the transfer of traffic to road following years of apathy by Governments.|$|E
5|$|The tower has {{numerous}} put-log holes, and {{is supported}} on four massive columns and surmounted by a nineteenth century low octagonal broached short slated recessed slated spire with fish-scale slates and weathercock. There are nineteenth century <b>louvred</b> paired cusped bell-lights and a corbelled embattled parapet. The tower contains a fine peal of bells, with {{the oldest of}} the original set of six being cast in 1749 by Rudhall bell foundry. Two were added in 1886, when the bell chamber was renovated. Two more were added to mark the new millennium in 2000, when some of the others were recast or tuned. The work was completed by Spring 2001. The tower presents one of the more noticeable views in Aberystwyth. It also contains a south side clock dated 1859.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower is}} {{in three stages}} and is {{supported}} by buttresses. In the lowest stage, on the west side, is a doorway in Romanesque style, {{on the north side}} is an ogee-headed lancet window. On the left of the east side is a Perpendicular-style porch. The middle stage has a two-light window on the west side, above which is a circular clock face, and on the north and east sides are lancet windows. The top stage contains a two-light <b>louvred</b> bell opening on each side. The parapet is plain, and projecting from it on the west side is a gargoyle. The spire is octagonal, with two tiers of lucarnes (dormer windows). The north side of the church is divided by buttresses into four bays. The second bay from the east contains a priest's door, above which is a lancet window. To the right of the door is a small trefoil-headed window. The other bays contain two-light windows with Early English tracery. Battlemented parapets run around the walls of the aisle walls and the clerestory. The clerestory has seven bays on either side, each containing a four-light Perpendicular window. At the east end are three windows. The central window, {{at the end of the}} chancel, is Perpendicular with seven lights. This is flanked by two aisle windows with plate tracery, the one to the right having four lights, and that to the left five lights.|$|E

The large pyramid serves as the main entrance to the <b>Louvre</b> Museum. Completed in 1989, {{it has become a}} landmark of the city of Paris.|$|R
25|$|A <b>louvred</b> door has {{fixed or}} movable wooden fins (often called slats or louvers) which permit open {{ventilation}} while preserving privacy and preventing {{the passage of}} light to the interior. Being relatively weak structures, they are most commonly used for wardrobes and drying rooms, where security is of less importance than good ventilation, although a very similar structure is commonly used to form window shutters. Double <b>louvred</b> doors were introduced into Seagate, built in Florida in 1929 by Gwendolyn and Powel Crosley, that provided the desired circulation of air with an added degree of privacy {{in that it is}} impossible to see through the fins in any direction.|$|E
25|$|The {{western end}} has {{weatherboard}} cladding {{with a single}} large doorway for freight access. This end originally faced the runway apron (straight six) and consisted of a central wide doorway with folding doors and high-level glazing. The high level glazing now has aluminium <b>louvred</b> infill, and a covered walkway linking the adjacent hangar 10 is used for covered car parking.|$|E
25|$|There is a s {{toilet block}} between {{the gate to}} O'Connell Terrace and the Stock Pavilion. It is {{constructed}} of brick and concrete and has a rough stucco finish in places.

50|$|<b>Louvre</b> station (known since 1989 as <b>Louvre</b> - Rivoli) was {{the first}} station to receive such a makeover, on the {{initiative}} of culture minister André Malraux in 1968. The platforms feature stonework, statues and other replica museum pieces, under subtle lighting, which together make the station into an antechamber of the Musée du <b>Louvre.</b> Until {{the reconstruction of the}} <b>Louvre</b> in the late 1980s, this station was the closest to the museum's entrance. When I. M. Pei's pyramid was added to the <b>Louvre</b> and made the central entrance {{at the end of the}} 1980s, the neighboring metro station Palais-Royal became the closest to the museum entrance; so close, in fact, that a subterranean corridor was constructed leading directly from the museum to the Palais-Royal station, which was renamed Palais-Royal - Musée du <b>Louvre.</b> As part of the change, <b>Louvre</b> station took on the name <b>Louvre</b> - Rivoli. Nevertheless, the resulting configuration—with the specially decorated <b>Louvre</b> station at a further distance from the museum—is confusing.|$|R

25|$|Kiln roofs, {{where the}} kiln was external, were {{generally}} built of a timber frame {{and covered in}} either peg tiles or slate. Some oasts had conical kiln roofs built of brick, these were covered in tar or pitch to keep them weatherproof. A few oasts had square kilns with brick roofs, again covered in tar or pitch. The top of the roof was open, and carried a cowl or <b>louvred</b> vent.|$|E
25|$|The eight {{large windows}} at the nave {{together}} with the other six at the transept and two at the sacristy are arched. There were originally eight large {{windows at the}} transept until the walling up of the two fronting Victoria Street. The original timber <b>louvred</b> casements of the windows were replaced by glass shutters with green glass in 1937. The stained glass windows in the lunettes of the nave and transept windows were presented to the cathedral by Bishop Charles Arsène Bourdon.|$|E
25|$|The Istana {{is similar}} to many 18th-century neo-Palladian style {{buildings}} designed by British military engineers in India. It has a tropical layout like a Malay house, surrounded by statuesque columns, deep verandahs, <b>louvred</b> windows and panelled doors to promote cross-ventilation. The central three-storey 28-metre-high tower block dominates the building. The reasonably well-proportioned two-storey side wings feature Ionic, Doric and Corinthian orders with Ionic colonnades at the second storey and Doric colonnades at the first storey. The building sits in the its elevated position overlooking its stately grounds, the Domain, reminiscent of the great gardens of England.|$|E

25|$|The {{church is}} built in red {{sandstone}} with a slate roof. Its plan {{consists of a}} west tower, a five-bay nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, a south transept, north and south porches, and a chancel which is narrower and less lofty than the nave. The north aisle is almost fully occupied by the Bold chapel. To {{the north of the}} chancel are two vestries. The tower has corner buttresses, a curvilinear west window and smaller <b>louvred</b> windows on all faces at the bell-stage. A clock face is on the south side. The clerestory windows are pitched dormers. The tower, chancel and transept are crenellated and the chancel has crocketted finials.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} surviving oast {{house is}} at Golford, Cranbrook near Tunbridge Wells. It dates from {{sometime in the}} 17th Century and closely mirrors the first documentary evidence on oasts soon after their introduction of hops into England in the mid 16th century. Early oast houses were simply adapted barns but, by the 18th Century, the distinctive tall buildings with conical roofs had been developed to increase the draught. At first these were square but around 1800 roundel kilns were developed {{in the belief that}} they were more efficient. Square kilns remained more popular in Hereford and Worcester and came back into fashion in the south east in the later 19th Century. In the 1930s, the cowls were replaced by <b>louvred</b> openings as electric fans and diesel oil ovens were employed.|$|E
25|$|The {{bell tower}} is embattled at its parapet and of three stages. The highest, the belfry stage, {{dating from the}} 15th century, {{contains}} <b>louvred</b> bell openings and is drained by gargoyles. At {{the base of the}} west buttress at the south side of tower is an inscription naming the mason Thomas de Somersby. The late 13th-century north aisle contains a single-chamfered pointed doorway at the west, and three windows, each with three lights, two of which were added during the 15th-century extension. The windows are traceried, with two incorporating quatrefoils. The nave Late Perpendicular clerestory windows are similar in style to those of the north aisle. The south aisle is Decorated, as is its south doorway, with its windows, one at the east and three at the south, 15th-century Late Perpendicular. The 14th-century south porch, too, is Perpendicular. It is two-storeyed and gabled, with a pointed-arch entrance opening, and surmounted by a parapet with pinnacles, and lit at its east and west sides by one small two-light window each. The upper level was a priest's room. Within the porch are stone benches, one on each side.|$|E

25|$|St Andrew's {{is built}} of {{sandstone}} with tiled roofs. It has a nave, south porch, chancel, south vestry, and west tower. The tower is divided by string courses into three stages. It has a plinth, diagonal buttresses, a battlemented parapet with gargoyles, and a pyramidal cap with a weathervane. On its northeast is an octagonal stair turret, {{also with a}} pyramidal cap. In the upper stages on the north, west and east fronts are carved fragments which {{are said to have}} come from Haughmond Abbey; these include canopied niches, some containing sculpted figures, and ceiling bosses. In the bottom stage is a three-light west window, there are rectangular openings in the middle stage, and the top stage contains two-light <b>louvred</b> bell openings. The north wall of the nave is Anglo-Saxon and contains blocks from former Roman buildings. These blocks have Lewis holes. This wall has a triple lancet window and a three-light arched window. In the south wall are two-three light windows and a porch containing a doorway. The porch has a parapeted gabled double lancet window, and a carved frieze. Set into the top of the south wall is a fragment of a 7th-century Anglo-Saxon cross-shaft. On each side of this is a carved block of similar date, one depicting a beast and the other a bird. The chancel also incorporates some re-used Roman masonry in its north wall, which contains two narrow round-headed windows and a triple lancet window. In the south wall is a blocked Norman priest's doorway. The east window has five lights, and around it are portions of blocked former windows. The vestry has two square windows, one on each side of a round-arched doorway.|$|E
500|$|The {{polygonal}} eastern tower {{has stepped}} buttresses at its corners and <b>louvred</b> belfry windows {{just below the}} parapet. Its origins are not entirely clear, but it was possibly originally a turret for stairs leading to a room over the chancel, later extended upwards as an aesthetic enhancement and {{to act as a}} beacon for mariners. Its date is uncertain, but it is much later than the chancel. Although its lack of height compared to the west tower has led to some questioning of its suitability as a beacon, {{it has been suggested that}} lining up the two towers guided ships into the navigable channel between the inlet's sandbanks; this is the [...] "leading light" [...] practice later achieved using pairs of lighthouses at different levels.|$|E

At the corners of the nave and the chancel are buttresses that rise up as spirelets. On the gables of the chancel and the nave are cross finials and pinnacles. There is an organ chamber at the east end of the north aisle, and a war memorial chapel at the east end of the south aisle. The windows along the clerestory are round with inset quatrefoils; all the other windows are lancets.|$|E
