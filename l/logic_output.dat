5000|$|Fan-out, {{a related}} concept, {{which is the}} number of logic inputs that a given <b>logic</b> <b>output</b> drives.|$|E
50|$|A {{molecular}} {{logic gate}} is a molecule that performs a logical operation on one or more logic inputs and produces a single <b>logic</b> <b>output.</b> Unlike a molecular sensor, the {{molecular logic gate}} will only output when a particular combination of inputs are present.|$|E
5000|$|Fanout {{describes}} how many logic inputs {{can be controlled}} by a single <b>logic</b> <b>output</b> without exceeding the electrical current ratings of the gate outputs. [...] The minimum practical fanout is about five. Modern electronic logic gates using CMOS transistors for switches have fanouts near fifty, and can sometimes go much higher.|$|E

5000|$|With active low open {{collector}} <b>logic</b> <b>outputs,</b> as used for control signals in many circuits, an OR function {{can be produced}} by wiring together several outputs. This arrangement is called a wired OR. This implementation of an OR function typically {{is also found in}} integrated circuits of N or P-type only transistor processes.|$|R
5000|$|The p-type MOSFETs are {{arranged}} in a so-called [...] "pull-up network" [...] (PUN) between the <b>logic</b> gate <b>output</b> and positive supply voltage, while a resistor is placed between the <b>logic</b> gate <b>output</b> and the negative supply voltage. The circuit is designed such that if the desired output is high, then the PUN will be active, creating a current path between the positive supply and the output.|$|R
5000|$|Commonly {{referred}} to as tristate [...] logic (a trademark of National Semiconductor), it comprises the usual true and false states, with a third transparent high impedance state (or 'off-state') which effectively disconnects the <b>logic</b> <b>output.</b> This provides {{an effective way to}} connect several logic outputs to a single input, where all but one are put into the high impedance state, allowing the remaining output to operate in the normal binary sense. This is commonly used to connect banks of computer memory and other similar devices to a common data bus; a large number of devices can communicate over the same channel simply by ensuring only one is enabled at a time.|$|E
50|$|Some {{systems that}} use tone {{signaling}} require higher reliability and less probability of falsing. One method of reducing falsing uses formats with simultaneous, paired tones. In decoding dual tones such as ICAO's SelCall, Quik Call I, MF, or DTMF, pairs of decoders are used and their outputs {{are connected to}} logical and circuitry. When tones are decoded, they are submitted to the and logic. If both are decoded at the same time, the and <b>logic</b> <b>output</b> shows a decoded pair of tones is present. To false in a dual-tone system, both decoders would have to false at the same moment. Two-out-of-five code and similar methods provide an additional check in some applications.|$|E
50|$|A {{voltage divider}} {{can be used}} as a crude logic level shifter to {{interface}} two circuits that use different operating voltages. For example, some logic circuits operate at 5V whereas others operate at 3.3V. Directly interfacing a 5V <b>logic</b> <b>output</b> to a 3.3V input may cause permanent damage to the 3.3V circuit. In this case, a voltage divider with an output ratio of 3.3/5 might be used to reduce the 5V signal to 3.3V, to allow the circuits to interoperate without damaging the 3.3V circuit. For this to be feasible, the 5V source impedance and 3.3V input impedance must be negligible, or they must be constant and the divider resistor values must account for their impedances. If the input impedance is capacitive, a purely resistive divider will limit the data rate. This can be roughly overcome by adding a capacitor in series with the top resistor, to make both legs of the divider capacitive as well as resistive.|$|E

40|$|The {{integration}} of biomolecular logic gates with field-effect devices the basic element of conventional electronic logic gates and computing - {{is one of}} the most attractive and promising approaches for the transformation of biomolecular logic principles into macroscopically useable electrical output signals. In this work, capacitive field-effect EIS (electrolyte-insulator-semiconductor) sensors based on a p-Si-SiO 2 -Ta 2 O 5 structure modified with a multi-enzyme membrane have been used for electronic transduction of biochemical signals processed by enzyme-based OR and AND logic gates. The realised OR logic gate composes of two enzymes (glucose oxidase and esterase) and was activated by ethyl butyrate or/and glucose. The AND logic gate composes of three enzymes (invertase, mutarotase and glucose oxidase) and was activated by two chemical input signals: sucrose and dissolved oxygen. The developed integrated enzyme logic gates produce local pH changes at the EIS sensor surface as a result of biochemical reactions activated by different combinations of chemical input signals, while the pH value of the bulk solution remains unchanged. The pH-induced charge changes at the gate-insulator (Ta 2 O 5) surface of the EIS transducer result in an electronic signal corresponding to the <b>logic</b> <b>output</b> produced by the immobilised enzymes. The <b>logic</b> <b>output</b> signals have been read out by means of a constant-capacitance method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
