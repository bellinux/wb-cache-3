5|$|Following {{the closure}} of the {{short-lived}} Oxford University Poohsticks Society, Poohsticks was brought to a larger audience by the annual World Poohsticks Championships. Originally these took place at Day's <b>Lock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> River Thames near Dorchester-on-Thames, Oxfordshire but were later moved to Langle Common in Witney also in Oxfordshire and has attracted over 1,500 visitors to the event, including many international visitors.|$|E
5|$|Near to the {{settlement}} is Southcote Junction, where the Great Western Main Line diverges into the Reading to Taunton {{line and the}} Reading to Basingstoke line. The railways were preceded by the Kennet and Avon Canal, which passes south of {{the settlement}}. Southcote lends {{its name to the}} 104th <b>lock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> canal.|$|E
5|$|The {{village of}} Woolhampton and the canal {{settlement}} of Aldermaston Wharf {{are the only}} significant settlements until the river enters the built-up area of Reading at Sheffield Lock in Theale. Even after this, the river is isolated from Reading's suburbs by a wide floodplain surrounding the river. In this stretch is Garston Lock, the other turf-sided <b>lock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> navigation.|$|E

5|$|For her thirteenth {{birthday}} on 12 June 1942, Frank {{received a}} book she had shown {{her father in}} a shop window a few days earlier. Although it was an autograph book, bound with red-and-white checkered cloth and with a small <b>lock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front, Frank decided she would {{use it as a}} diary, and she began writing in it almost immediately. In her entry dated 20 June 1942, she lists many of the restrictions placed upon the lives of the Dutch Jewish population.|$|E
5|$|Keynsham {{is located}} where the River Chew meets the River Avon. Fishing {{rights for the}} Millground and Chewton {{sections}} of the Chew are owned by Keynsham Angling Club. The Mill Ground stretch of the River Chew consists of the six fields on the western bank from Chewton Place at Chewton Keynsham to the Albert Mill. The water is home to Chub, Roach, European perch and Rudd, along with good numbers of Gudgeon, Dace and Trout. Keynsham <b>Lock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Avon opened in 1727. Just above the lock are some visitor moorings and a pub, on an island between the lock and the weir. The weir {{side of the island}} is also the mouth of the River Chew.|$|E
5|$|Launched in 1991, Japan's Yohkoh (Sunbeam) {{satellite}} observed solar flares at X-ray wavelengths. Mission data allowed {{scientists to}} identify several {{different types of}} flares, and demonstrated that the corona away from regions of peak activity was much more dynamic and active than had previously been supposed. Yohkoh observed an entire solar cycle but went into standby mode when an annular eclipse in 2001 caused it to lose its <b>lock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Sun. It was destroyed by atmospheric re-entry in 2005.|$|E

5|$|Poohsticks is a sport first {{mentioned}} in The House at Pooh Corner, a Winnie-the-Pooh book by A. A. Milne. It {{is a simple}} sport which may be played on any bridge over running water; each player drops a stick on the upstream side of a bridge and the one whose stick first appears on the downstream side is the winner. The annual World Poohsticks Championships have been held at Day's <b>Lock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> River Thames in the UK since 1984.|$|E
5|$|Six-year-old Maisie (Onata Aprile) {{lives in}} a New York {{apartment}} with her parents, Susanna (Julianne Moore), a singer in a rock band, and Beale (Steve Coogan), an international art dealer. Susanna and Beale argue with each other viciously and constantly, often ignoring Maisie and leaving her {{in the care of}} their nanny, Margo (Joanna Vanderham). Maisie does not always understand her parents' actions, such as when Susanna hires a locksmith to change the <b>lock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> apartment's front door to keep Beale out. When they decide to separate, both parents are granted joint custody of Maisie.|$|E
5|$|After launch, {{the missile}} was guided towards the target {{location}} {{as determined by}} the ship using a three-axis Attitude Reference Assembly (ATA) in an AN/DSQ-44 guidance section. The ATA was less accurate than a full-fledged inertial system, but good enough for Harpoon's range. For stabilization and control, the AGM-84A had four fixed cruciform wings (3x BSU-42/B, 1x BSU-43/B) and four movable BSU-44/B tail fins. The missile flew at a low cruise altitude and at a predetermined distance from the expected target position, its AN/DSQ-28 J-band active radar seeker in the nose was activated to acquire and <b>lock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> target. The radar switch-on distance could be set to lower or higher values, the former requiring a more precisely-known target location but reducing the risk to be defeated by enemy Electronic Counter Measures (ECM).|$|E

5|$|During the inter-war {{years the}} {{navigation}} struggled {{to hold its}} own against competition from the railways and later the roads, and was affected by miners' strikes in the coal industry. Traffic was spasmodic, rising from 381,727 tonnes in 1926, {{the year of the}} general strike, to 815,329 tonnes in 1937, but much of the latter was short-haul traffic, rather than long-haul, and the revenues did not increase correspondingly. In an agreement with Hatfield Main Colliery and the Aire and Calder, Bramwith <b>Lock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Stainforth and Keadby Canal was lengthened in 1932, to allow compartment boats to be used for the coal traffic, while straightening of a stretch near Doncaster and {{the construction of a new}} warehouse and wharf were largely funded by Doncaster Corporation in 1934.|$|E
5|$|Homer, Bart and {{the group}} arrive at Miami's Pro Player Stadium for pre-game festivities, but the ticket agent reveals the tickets Wally had bought were counterfeit. Attempting to sneak into the stadium, the group is locked up in the {{detention}} center and vents their frustration on Homer. They are freed when Kogen's friend Dolly Parton uses her extra-strength makeup remover to dissolve the <b>lock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door. They run into a skybox suite and get {{a view of the}} game until the owner Rupert Murdoch arrives and confronts them. Homer's posse flee to the field, chased by Murdoch's security, until they get lost in the sea of victorious players. The group ends up in the locker room where they share the celebration, and everyone has a Super Bowl ring on one of their hands at game's end.|$|E
5|$|In 1723, the Commissioners of the Kent and Sussex Rother Levels {{employed}} the civil engineering contractor John Reynolds to make repairs to Scots Float Sluice, a timber <b>lock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower river. He built a dovetailed {{sheet pile wall}} below the foundations, and the Commissioners offered him the job of maintaining the levels in 1725, for which he would be paid Â£65 per year. He moved to Iden and held the post for fourteen years. Silting of the river estuary caused mounting problems with the drainage of the levels during the 1720s. Reynolds carried out further work on the sluice in 1729, and in 1732 reconstructed it to provide an extra outlet. Several new channels were excavated through the levels in the early 1730s, {{so that all the}} runoff passed through Scots Float. Reynolds resigned his post in 1739 as he was too busy with other engineering projects.|$|E

5|$|In 1794, a basin {{was built}} above Framilode lock, so that vessels could wait {{there until the}} tide in the Severn was at a {{suitable}} level. This had been requested by the Thames and Severn Canal company, but requests for a horse towing path in 1799 and 1812 were dismissed as too expensive. They eventually provided one after the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal had been built, and the canal was {{the only part of}} the waterway from Shrewsbury on the Severn to Teddington on the Thames that did not have one. It was completed in August 1827. The opening of the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal in 1825 required a slight diversion where they crossed at Saul, and the levels were adjusted by building a new <b>lock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Stroudwater below the junction, to ensure neither company lost water to the other. The new company paid for its construction.> After the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal opened to Sharpness in 1827, the link between Saul and the Severn at Framilode was used much less, although coal from the Forest of Dean still used that route.|$|E
5|$|In {{the city}} centre of Bath it passes under various bridges {{including}} the Midland Bridge which was originally {{built by the}} Midland Railway Company to allow the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway access to and from its Green Park Terminus Station. In November 2011 the navigation between Bath and Bristol was closed because of safety concerns about Victoria Bridge. Weston <b>Lock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outskirts of Bath is in what now forms the Newbridge. Weston Cut is a man made channel, opened in 1727, for boats to approach and pass through Weston Lock, which created an island between the cut and the river weir, which became known as Dutch Island after {{the owner of the}} brass mill established on the riverside in the early 18th century.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the main}} matches on the undercard was between Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels. At {{the start of the}} year, Angle and Michaels both participated in the Royal Rumble match at the 2005 Royal Rumble {{pay-per-view}} event. During the match, Michaels eliminated Angle. In retaliation, Angle returned to the match and eliminated Michaels and then attacked him outside the ring. The two engaged in a feud, which led to an Interpromotional match at WrestleMania 21, as Angle was part of the SmackDown! roster and Michaels belonged to the Raw roster. At WrestleMania 21, Angle got the win over Michaels by forcing him to submit to the Ankle <b>Lock.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> June 13 episode of Raw, Angle was revealed to be the second draft pick for the Raw brand. That same evening, Michaels challenged Angle to a rematch at Vengeance, which Angle accepted.|$|E

5|$|The rivers {{were run}} {{down by the}} 1920s and, with high {{unemployment}} in the area, West Ham Corporation and the Lee Conservancy Board applied for a government unemployment relief grant, with which to fund major improvements. In addition {{to work on the}} channels, Bow Tidal Lock was duplicated, Marshgate Lock was rebuilt further east as City Mill Lock, and a second new lock at Carpenters Road was constructed. It used up-and-over radial gates operated by winches, rather than the traditional mitre gates used at City Mill Lock. The gates were quadrant-shaped, and were raised out of the river to allow boats to enter or leave the lock. An Act of Parliament was obtained in 1930 to authorise the work, called the River Lee (Flood Relief) Act, and work began the following year. The project was completed in 1935. Before the work, there had been a floodgate on the Waterworks River above its junction with the Three Mills Wall River, and a large pool, the City Mill Pool, connecting to the City Mills River and Saint Thomas Creek. Marshgate Lock was situated {{to the west of the}} junction between the Pudding Mill River and Saint Thomas Creek. It was originally built in 1864, by adding a second set of gates to Hunters Gates, a floodgate which had been built around 1847. The reconstructed lock was built on the site of the City Mill Pool, and had two sets of gates at its eastern end, to prevent high tidal levels in Waterworks River flooding the waterways to the west. It was labelled Marshgate Lane <b>Lock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 1948 map, but was called Ward Lock, after a local councillor, and is now known as City Mills Lock. The course of the Saint Thomas Creek was then straightened, and the original Marshgate Lock was bypassed. Pudding Mill River became a dead end when the lower section was filled in, as was most of the Three Mills Back River, and the floodgate on Waterworks River was also removed. Reconstruction of the channels included widening City Mill River to , while Three Mills Wall River and Waterworks River were made twice that width.|$|E
