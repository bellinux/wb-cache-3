40|$|Solid state {{lighting}} technology has achieved great progress especially in white light emittingdiodes (LEDs). The LEDs exhibit many advantages such as long lifetime and high light efficiency. Moreover, they are environmental friendly {{compared to the}} conventional light sources. However, the key issue in widespread application of white <b>LEDs</b> is <b>packaging</b> technology. High light efficiency requires the white LEDs endure a high working temperature which will accelerate the thermal aging of packaging materials. Traditionally, epoxy resins are used in white <b>LED</b> <b>packaging.</b> However, under long time exposing to high temperature, epoxy resin will result in an obvious discoloration and yellowing phenomenon which will adversely affect the light efficiency of white LEDs. So the rapid development of white LED technology requires the packaging materials with better performance in thermal resistance and optical transmission. Compared to epoxy resin, silicone {{is a kind of}} novel packaging material for white LEDs. Its excellent performances including high light transmittance, low water absorption and non-discoloring behavior attract numerous attentions of white LED manufactures. What's more, the good thermal stability property makes it suitable even in high-power LED application. However, there are still some reliability issues of silicone application in white <b>LED</b> <b>packaging,</b> such as fracture, delamination and chemical corrosion. Thus the evaluation and selection of silicone for <b>LED</b> <b>packaging</b> are very important. In this study, some major failure modes of silicone in white <b>LED</b> <b>packaging</b> are discussed. To better understand the performance of silicone, a series of test methods are set up to evaluate its mechanical, thermal and chemical properties. Corresponding simulation models are used to verify the test results. Some common properties such as transmittance and infrared spectrum are also demonstrated and studied in this paper. Finally, a practical methodology has been proposed to serve as guideline for silicon selection in white <b>LED</b> <b>packaging...</b>|$|R

Thermal contact {{resistance}} {{is one of}} key technologies for heat transfer of high power light emitting diodes (<b>LED)</b> <b>packaging.</b> In this paper, based on the resistance network model of <b>LED</b> <b>packaging,</b> a 3 -D finite element simulation model (FEM) is established and thermal transient testing experiments are also performed by Thermal Transient tester (T 3 Ster).

To the resistance of TIM layer, the result of experiment is only a 1 % error compared to the result of FEM simulation. Therefore, The FEM simulation and experiment are mutually validated. In order to thoroughly study on thermal contact resistance, {{based on the principle}} of structure function, thermal resistance of three different types of TIM layer between metal core printed circuit board (MCPCB) and aluminum heat sink are measured and compared. Experiment results indicate that the quality of interface affects the thermal contact resistance to a great extent...|$|R

5000|$|Temperature dependence: LED {{performance}} largely {{depends on}} the ambient temperature of the operating environment - or thermal management properties. Overdriving an LED in high ambient temperatures may result in overheating the <b>LED</b> <b>package,</b> eventually leading to device failure. An adequate heat sink is needed to maintain long life. This is especially important in automotive, medical, and military uses where devices must operate {{over a wide range}} of temperatures, which require low failure rates. Toshiba has produced LEDs with an operating temperature range of −40 to 100 °C, which suits the LEDs for both indoor and outdoor use in applications such as lamps, ceiling lighting, street lights, and floodlights.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a simple}} <b>LED</b> <b>package,</b> {{typically}} {{all of the}} cathodes (negative terminals) {{or all of the}} anodes (positive terminals) of the segment LEDs are connected and brought out to a common pin; this is referred to as a [...] "common cathode" [...] or [...] "common anode" [...] device. Hence a 7 segment plus decimal point package will only require nine pins, though commercial products typically contain more pins, and/or spaces where pins would go, in order to match standard IC sockets. Integrated displays also exist, with single or multiple digits. Some of these integrated displays incorporate their own internal decoder, though most do not: each individual LED is brought out to a connecting pin as described.Multiple-digit LED displays as used in pocket calculators and similar devices used multiplexed displays {{to reduce the number of}} I/O pins required to control the display. For example, all the anodes of the A segments of each digit position would be connected together and to a driver circuit pin, while the cathodes of all segments for each digit would be connected. To operate any particular segment of any digit, the controlling integrated circuit would turn on the cathode driver for the selected digit, and the anode drivers for the desired segments; then after a short blanking interval the next digit would be selected and new segments lit, in a sequential fashion. In this manner an eight digit display with seven segments and a decimal point would require only 8 cathode drivers and 8 anode drivers, instead of sixty-four drivers and IC pins. Often in pocket calculators the digit drive lines would be used to scan the keyboard as well, providing further savings; however, pressing multiple keys at once would produce odd results on the multiplexed display.|$|E

30|$|In the <b>LED</b> <b>packaging</b> {{shown in}} Figure[*] 1, {{phosphor}} particles are usually mixed with silicone matrix material, and then dispensed onto LED chips directly [4]. Since {{the arrangement of}} phosphor particles {{plays an important role}} in determining the optical performances of white LEDs, the concentration of phosphor particles should be as uniform as possible. However, the density of phosphor particles (about 4800 [*]kg/m 3) is bigger than that of silicone (about 1120 [*]kg/m 3). Phosphor particles would settle in silicone matrix because of the gravity during dispensing and curing processes as a consequence. With the settling of phosphor particles, the luminous efficiency would decrease and so did the homogeneity of the color. Thus, it is a serious problem in the <b>LED</b> <b>packaging.</b>|$|R
