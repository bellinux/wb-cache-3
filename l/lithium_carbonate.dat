Despite many studies and tentative interpretations, {{the origin of}} this extra-capacity is not assessed yet.

In this work, we combine high resolution soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy with tunable probing depth and photoemission spectroscopy to obtain profiles of the surface evolution of a well-known prototype conversion-alloying type mixed metal oxide (carbon coated ZnFe 2 O 4) electrode. We show that a partially reversible layer of alkyl <b>lithium</b> <b>carbonates</b> is formed (∼ 5 - 7 nm) at the SEI surface when reaching higher Li storage levels.

In addition, the following compositions were also destroyed: Comp B, LX- IO, LX- 1 6, LX- 17, PBX- 9404, and XM 46 (liquid gun propellant).
