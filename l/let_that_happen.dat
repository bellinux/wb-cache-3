5|$|A year passes, with Amy and Rory {{periodically}} travelling {{with the}} Doctor. Brian, after observing Amy and Rory returning from one trip, asks the Doctor {{what has happened}} to his past companions. The Doctor tells some had met a sad fate but he will not <b>let</b> <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> to Amy or Rory. Humanity forgets about the cubes, using them as paperweights or other functions.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, Ungdomshuset was {{ravaged by}} fire {{destroying}} {{much of the}} interior. The city council used this opportunity {{as an excuse for}} closing down the house claiming that the building were no longer fit for human use. But the users were not going to <b>let</b> <b>that</b> <b>happen.</b> They started renovating the house themselves and after six months the house was reopened for the public. The city counsel protested about this but after the city building inspectors had inspected the house they found the house in an even better state of repair than before the fire. The city counsel then had to withdraw their protest.|$|E
25|$|During {{the climb}} of the Col de Marie-Blanque, Dessel and Mercado again {{proved to be}} the strongest with Dessel coming through first as he had done on the two earlier climbs already: the polka dot jersey was his. Landaluze came closest to coming back as he was about 50 meters behind {{at some point during the}} descent, but the two leaders worked {{together}} not to <b>let</b> <b>that</b> <b>happen.</b> However, about 15 kilometres before the finish line, Mercado was hoping to make a deal with Dessel: since Dessel was going to be winning the yellow and polka dot jersey, he was hoping to be getting the stage win from Dessel in return for helping him. However Dessel wanted it all, so Mercado stopped helping and Dessel had to maintain the lead by himself to prevent Landaluze from coming back. In the end, Mercado sprinted past Dessel about 300 metres from the finish and won the stage. Landaluze finished third about a minute behind. Moreni, Rinero, Isasi and Vasseur also managed to stay in front of the pelont, the others were caught.|$|E
60|$|To go {{into the}} other room would be to drop the conversation. I was {{determined}} not to <b>let</b> <b>that</b> catastrophe <b>happen.</b> It was just possible that Mrs. Beauly's maid might have quitted her service, or might have been left behind in England. My information would not be complete until I knew what had become of the maid. I pushed my chair back a little from the fire-place, and took a hand-screen from a table near me; it might be made useful in hiding my face, if any more disappointments were in store for me.|$|R
60|$|A {{moment before}} the {{hillside}} had appeared utterly lifeless, so still and rugged and desolate {{that one must}} notice and welcome the stir of a mouse or ground squirrel in the moss, speaking of life that is glad and free and vigorous even in the deepest solitudes; yet now, so quietly did the old wolf appear, so perfectly did her rough gray coat blend with the rough gray rocks, that the hillside seemed just as tenantless as before. A stray wind seemed to move the mosses, that was all. Only where the mountains once slept now they seemed wide-awake. Keen eyes saw every moving thing, from the bees in the bluebells to the slow fishing-boats far out at sea; sharp ears that were cocked like a collie's heard every chirp and trill and rustle, and a nose that understood everything was holding up every vagrant breeze and searching it for its message. For the cubs were coming {{out for the first}} time to play in the big world, and no wild mother ever <b>lets</b> <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> without first taking infinite precautions that her little ones be not molested nor made afraid.|$|R
50|$|Sammi instructs Eddie {{on how to}} {{go about}} getting revenge on a group of bullies who make his school life a torment, since Sammi himself was bullied {{constantly}} in high school and he wants to now take the revenge on Eddie's bullies that he never got to take on his own. Eddie explains the situation to his best friend Roger (Glen Morgan), who is highly skeptical of the whole thing. At first the revenge is innocent enough, but before long the plans start to become more sinister, with the potential to cause real physical harm and eventually building towards murder. Having no desire to take things so far, Eddie determines to sever ties with the dead rocker, but Sammi has no intention of <b>letting</b> <b>that</b> <b>happen.</b> When Eddie is alone in his room, Sammi causes some soda to spill on the record, initiating an electrical surge that gives him just the amount of energy he needs to escape out of the record and become able to carry out his murderous plans without the help of another. Eddie smashes his record player and stereo system after a personal, face-to-face visit from Sammi, hoping to make sure he never sees the dead rocker in his room again.|$|R
500|$|Contrary to his {{statements}} to Patton, Eisenhower never seriously considered removing the general from {{duty in the}} European Theater. Writing of the incident before the media attention, he said, [...] "If this thing ever gets out, they'll be howling for Patton's scalp, {{and that will be}} the end of Georgie's service in this war. I simply cannot <b>let</b> <b>that</b> <b>happen.</b> Patton is indispensable to the war effort– one of the guarantors of our victory." [...] Still, following the capture of Messina in August 1943, Patton did not command a force in combat for 11 months.|$|E
500|$|Chandler's {{budget was}} limited, so {{in an effort}} to reduce {{expenditures}} he and Hendrix completed much of the album's pre-production work at their shared apartment. From the start, Chandler intentionally minimized the creative input of Mitchell and Redding. He later explained: [...] "I wasn't concerned that Mitch or Noel might feel that they weren't having enough—or any—say... I had been touring and recording in a band for years, and I'd seen everything end as a compromise. Nobody ended up doing what they really wanted to do. I was not going to <b>let</b> <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> with Jimi." [...] When the Experience began studio rehearsals, Hendrix already had the chord sequences and tempos worked out for Mitchell, and Chandler would direct Redding's bass parts.|$|E
2500|$|After {{hearing a}} news {{report of the}} {{attempted}} murder of James Meredith, the defendant, Sidney Street, took a 48-star U.S. flag and burned it. Upon being questioned by police, he said, [...] "Yes; that is my flag; I burned it. If they <b>let</b> <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> to Meredith, we don't need an American flag." ...|$|E
5000|$|Although {{difficult}} to quantify, growing skepticism toward authority in mainland China {{appears to be}} spurring public support for media criticism (often indirect and carefully couched) of the State and slowly diluting {{the legitimacy of the}} party [...] This rise in skepticism is reported by informed observers to be occurring all across East Asia. Such observers point to increased publicity given to cases of official corruption, malfeasance, and ineptness—along with broader declines in social values such as civility and respect—as at least partly responsible for greater media and popular doubts about elected and appointed officials as compared to the past. At the same time, public skepticism of authority can and often does include skepticism toward the media themselves. Journalists, like individuals in other sectors of the mainland Chinese society, are far less willing than in the past to submit blindly to authority. Journalists were active participants in the 1989 demonstrations that culminated in the events at Tiananmen Square. The Tiananmen episode made it all but impossible to reconcile the growing desire of mainland Chinese journalists for control over their own profession with the party's interest in not <b>letting</b> <b>that</b> <b>happen.</b> There have even been occasional acts of open, outright defiance of the party, though these acts remain rare.|$|R
5000|$|Wesley had {{a lifelong}} {{complicated}} {{relationship with her}} family and especially with her mother, who had a sharp tongue. Following {{the death of her}} father in 1961, her mother said: [...] "I'm not going to <b>let</b> <b>that</b> lingering death <b>happen</b> to me. When the time comes I'm going to crawl to the Solent and swim out." [...] Wesley replied with feeling: [...] "I'll help you".|$|R
50|$|At work, Buffy {{talks with}} Xander {{on the phone}} until a student, Amanda, comes in for counseling. The girl asks about liking a boy who picks on her and seeks Buffy's advice, but Buffy gets a bit distracted with her own similar {{situation}} with Spike and rambles about how she's not going to <b>let</b> <b>that</b> problem <b>happen</b> again. Buffy returns home to bickering amongst the Potential Slayers and news from Willow that another Potential Slayer has been found, already in Sunnydale. The Potentials examine weapons and Dawn tries {{to fit into the}} group's conversation, but it's a struggle. Spike arrives and then leaves with Buffy and the other girls for some training. Andrew pouts because he's not invited and although silent, Dawn feels left out as well.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the bronze}} medal game, Lithuanians faced the Unified Team {{for the third}} time that year, with each team winning once. Captain Valdemaras Chomičius felt that [...] "We lost to them once already, we couldn't <b>let</b> <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> again. The final had to be ours", while Šarūnas Marčiulionis added that [...] "We didn't have any choice, we {{absolutely}} had to win at any cost". Head coach Vladas Garastas briefed the team saying [...] "Men, you're playing for the people of Lithuania. Forget about your personal ambitions. People are watching you, losing sleep over you". Šarūnas Marčiulionis: [...] "Some were listening on radios, others were watching on television. All of Lithuania was stopped. Everyone was watching that game". In a close match, the Lithuanians kept the lead all times for an 82–78 victory, that felt inexpressibly remarkable for a tiny country which regained its independence just two years and was playing the remains of its former colonizer. Marčiulionis played 40 minutes during that match and scored 29 points, while Sabonis added 27. Donnie Nelson described the locker room as [...] "like winning the NBA championship times five". After the bronze medal victory, de jure Head of State Vytautas Landsbergis visited the team at the locker room, and they all sung the national anthem.|$|E
2500|$|The tour's {{rendition}} of [...] "Rope Burn" [...] was considered [...] "incredibly sexy" [...] and [...] "what everyone was talking about", becoming its most controversial performance. During the act, Jackson [...] "plucks a male fan {{out of the}} crowd and ties his hands to the arms of a chair on stage while she gyrates around him and eventually kisses him." [...] The selected fan was required to be strapped into the chair due to safety concerns from Jackson's previous tour, after the participant had forcefully grabbed and fondled her while onstage. Jackson said, [...] "Everyone thinks it's this kinky thing. But the reason he gets strapped in is on this last tour, this guy grabbed my crotch. I sat on his lap and then I stood up and he grabbed my crotch, and I was trying to move his hand and he was too strong for me and he was just rubbing on my crotch. There was nothing I could do, so I said to myself I would never <b>let</b> <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> again." [...] Jackson's performance of [...] "What About" [...] is also infamous for its portrayal of domestic violence and abuse. The tour's [...] "racy" [...] costumes were designed by fashion designer David Cardona, who commented [...] "All her life it's been about Janet being cute. Now it's about Janet being sexy." ...|$|E

6000|$|Please {{understand}} I do {{not consider}} this concentration of activity and these vast [...] "artificialisations" [...] {{of the human body}} as attractive or desirable things. At the first proposal much of this tampering with the natural stuff of life will strike anyone, I think, as ugly and horrible, just as seeing a little child, green-white and still under an anaesthetic, gripped my heart much more dreadfully than the sight of the same child actively bawling with pain. But the business {{of this paper is to}} discuss things that may happen, and not to evolve dreams of loveliness. Perhaps things of this kind will be manageable without dreadfulness. Perhaps man will come to such wisdom that neither the knife nor the drugs nor any of the powers which science thrusts into his hand will slay the beauty of life for him.
