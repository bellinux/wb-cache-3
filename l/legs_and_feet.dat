5|$|Like other New World vultures, the Andean condor has {{the unusual}} habit of urohidrosis: it often empties its cloaca onto its <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet.</b> A cooling effect through {{evaporation}} {{has been proposed}} {{as a reason for}} this behavior, but it does not make any sense in the cold Andean habitat of the bird. Because of this habit, their legs are often streaked with a white buildup of uric acid.|$|E

5|$|The African crake {{is smaller}} than the corn crake, which also has darker upperparts, a plain grey face and {{different}} underparts barring pattern. In flight, the African species has shorter, blunter wings with a less prominent white leading edge, and deeper wingbeats than its relative. Other sympatric crakes are smaller with white markings on the upperparts, different underparts patterns and a shorter bill. The African rail has dark brown upperparts, a long red bill and red <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E
5|$|The adult California condor is {{a uniform}} black with the {{exception}} of large triangular patches or bands of white {{on the underside of the}} wings. It has gray <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet,</b> an ivory-colored bill, a frill of black feathers surrounding the base of the neck, and brownish red eyes. The juvenile is mostly a mottled dark brown with blackish coloration on the head. It has mottled gray instead of white on the underside of its flight feathers.|$|E
5|$|The blades are transtibial prostheses, {{meaning they}} replace <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet</b> that are amputated {{below the knee}} (BK).

On physical examination, two dimple-like, old operation scars were observed in the right buttock (Fig. 1 A). A moderate atro-phy of right gluteal and harmstring muscles was observed and the circumferential diameter of right thigh decreased compared to the left side. Deep compression in his right lower buttock prom-ptly elicited a cramping pain in the right buttock which radiated in the distal <b>leg</b> <b>and,</b> more excruciating pain, in dorsum and sole of the foot.

5|$|Females {{are easily}} {{distinguished}} from males {{as they have}} a narrower and less domed head, narrower and proportionally longer beak, smaller cere and nostrils, more slender and pinkish grey <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet,</b> and proportionally longer tail. While their plumage colour is not {{very different from that}} of the male, the toning is more subtle, with less yellow and mottling. They tend to resist more and be more aggressive than the male when handled. Nesting females also have a brood patch on the bare skin of the belly.|$|E

5|$|The Aylesbury duck is a {{breed of}} domesticated duck, bred mainly for its meat and appearance. It {{is a large}} duck with pure white plumage, a pink bill, orange <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet,</b> an unusually large keel, and a {{horizontal}} stance with its body parallel to the ground. The precise origins of the breed are unclear, but raising white ducks became popular in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England, in the 18th century owing to the demand for white feathers as a filler for quilts. Over the 19th century selective breeding for size, shape and colour led to the Aylesbury duck.|$|E
5|$|The {{adult male}} has a dark grey beak and pink eye-rings. The adult female has a bone-coloured beak, grey eye-rings and ear patches that are whiter and more {{distinctive}} {{than those of}} the male. The feathers of its underparts and underwing coverts have larger white margins {{than those of the}} male, leading to a more barred or scalloped pattern to its plumage. Its <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet</b> are a little lighter than those of the male. Moulting appears to take place in stages in late summer—some time between January or February and April or May, and is poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|The {{song thrush}} (as {{represented}} by the nominate subspecies T. p. philomelos) is 20 to 23.5centimetres (8 to 9.25in) in length and weighs 50–107grammes (1.8 to 3.8oz). The sexes are similar, with plain brown backs and neatly black-spotted cream or yellow-buff underparts, becoming paler on the belly. The underwing is warm yellow, the bill is yellowish and the <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet</b> are pink. The upperparts of this species become colder in tone from west to east across the breeding range from Sweden to Siberia. The juvenile resembles the adult, but has buff or orange streaks {{on the back and}} wing coverts.|$|E
50|$|Recently, {{vestibular}} reflexes {{have been}} investigated using leg rotation experiments. A <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> rotation test {{can be used to}} investigate changes in neuron activity within the labyrinth, or the inner ear. When the head is rotated while the <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> are rotated 90 degrees, the vestibular signals cause the brain to inhibit movement {{in the direction of the}} rotation. At the same time, it activates the muscles on the opposite side in an attempt to correct for the displacement.|$|R

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{consider}} the functional characteristics of a five segment lower <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> model during gait, using the application of elementary kinematics to measure, analyse <b>and</b> describe lower <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> motion <b>and</b> compare these parameters between two subject groups with plantar pathological hyperkeratosis (PPH); PPH group one having callus under metatarsal heads 2, 3 and 4, and PPH group two having callus under metatarsal heads 1 and 5. Root's elegant theory of foot function (Root et al. 1966; Root et al. 1977) has become widely accepted in podiatry. This theory suggests {{the orientation of the}} subtalar joint axis influences the amount of motion in all the cardinal body planes. Therefore, a foot which has a joint axis which is highly inclined will exhibit more transverse plane lower leg rotation than frontal plane calcaneal motion; will be a less mobile foot; and tend to present with callus under metatarsal heads 1 and 5. Conversely, a foot with a lower inclined subtalar joint axis will exhibit more frontal plane calcaneal motion than transverse plane leg rotation; will be more mobile; and tend to have callus under the 2, 3 and 4 metatarsal heads. A non-invasive in vivo kinematic method was developed to collect three dimensional coordinates of markers attached to a novel five segment model of the lower <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> in order to estimate the angular displacement and motion between the lower <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> segments. The results have shown that there are statistically significant differences in the lower <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> kinematics between the PPH groups (p < 0. 05) during various periods within the stance phase. These differences suggest that the motions of the lower <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> are similar to those proposed by the podiatric theory. However the findings contradict Root's theory within the latter stages of midstance and propulsive periods of gait. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
5|$|This {{is a large}} duck, and the male's long central tail {{feathers}} {{give rise}} to the species' English and scientific names. Both sexes have blue-grey bills and grey <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet.</b> The drake is more striking, having a thin white stripe running {{from the back of}} its chocolate-coloured head down its neck to its mostly white undercarriage. The drake also has attractive grey, brown, and black patterning on its back and sides. The hen's plumage is more subtle and subdued, with drab brown feathers similar to those of other female dabbling ducks. Hens make a coarse quack and the drakes a flute-like whistle.|$|E
5|$|Venous {{insufficiency}} {{results when}} the vein dilates secondary to a vein wall disease or when normal {{functioning of the}} valves, which serve to keep blood flowing to the heart and to prevent reflux, become damaged and/or incompetent (the dilation of a vein will prevent valves to close properly). This incompetence will result in an reversed blood flow through the affected vein or veins. In varicose veins the valves are damaged, disfunction or missing and the insufficiency will be chronic. The reversed blood pools in the low third of <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} few hours after the mudflow hit, she was covered by {{concrete}} but got her hand {{through a crack in}} the debris. After a rescuer noticed her hand protruding from a pile of debris, he and others cleared tiles and wood {{over the course of a}} day. Once the girl was freed from the waist up, her rescuers attempted to pull her out, but found the task impossible without breaking her legs in the process. Each time a person pulled her, the water pooled around her, rising so that it seemed she would drown if they let her go, so rescue workers placed a tire around her body to keep her afloat. Divers discovered that Sánchez's legs were caught under a door made of bricks, with her aunt's arms clutched tightly around her <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E

In keeping with the show's general design scheme, Perry is constructed of geometric shapes in a style reminiscent of deceased Looney Tunes animator Tex Avery. Povenmire uses different design styles for drawing Perry depending on how he is portrayed. When Perry is portrayed as a domesticated and mindless pet, Povenmire begins with a square shaped like a loaf of bread. He then draws his front <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet</b> before drawing his bill, which is set at a certain angle. Povenmire then draws his eyeballs, which are never focused and look in opposing directions in a daze. He concludes the figure by adding his hind legs, tail, hair, and finally color.|$|E
5|$|Nuthatches forage along {{tree trunks}} and {{branches}} and {{are members of}} the same feeding guild as woodpeckers. Unlike woodpeckers and treecreepers, however, they do not use their tails for additional support, relying instead on their strong <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet</b> to progress in jerky hops. They are able to descend head-first and hang upside-down beneath twigs and branches. Krüper's nuthatch can even stretch downward from an upside-down position to drink water from leaves without touching the ground. Rock nuthatches forage with a similar technique to the woodland species, but seek food on rock faces and sometimes buildings. When breeding, a pair of nuthatches will only feed within their territory, but at other times will associate with passing tits or join mixed-species feeding flocks.|$|E
5|$|The Fiji parrotfinch {{is a small}} finch, 10cm (4in) in length. The {{adult male}} has a bright green body and wings, red head, and scarlet rump and tail. The blackish {{feathering}} of the chin becomes dark blue on the lower throat and turquoise on the upper breast before fading into the green of the underparts. The stubby bill is blackish-grey, the eyes are reddish-brown and the <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> <b>feet</b> are pinkish-brown. The female {{is very similar to}} the male, but possibly slightly duller and with paler flanks. Young birds have a dark-tipped yellow bill and sometimes a bluish face which gradually turns red, {{but the rest of the}} plumage is like the adult. Full mature plumage is achieved at about 20 months. Some rare individuals of this parrotfinch have the entire head and face blue, apparently due to a natural mutation.|$|E
40|$|Peripheral {{circulation}} {{is severely}} compromised in the advanced stages of peripheral arterial disease. Recently, {{it was shown}} that the application of − 40 mmHg intermittent negative pressure (INP) to the lower <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> enhances macro‐ <b>and</b> microcirculation in healthy volunteers. In this case report, we describe the effects of INP treatment on four patients with lower limb ischemia <b>and</b> hard‐to‐heal <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> ulcers. We hypothesized that INP therapy may have beneficial hemodynamic and clinical effects in the patients. Four patients (age range: 61 – 79 years) with hard‐to‐heal <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> ulcers (6 – 24 months) and ankle‐brachial pressure indices of ≤ 0. 60 on the affected side were included. They were treated with an 8 ‐week intervention period of − 40 mmHg INP (10 sec negative pressure and 7 sec atmospheric pressure) on the lower limbs. A custom‐made vacuum chamber was used to apply INP to the affected lower <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> <b>foot</b> for 2 h per day. After 8 weeks of INP therapy, one ulcer healed completely, while the other three ulcers were almost completely healed. These cases suggest that INP may facilitate wound healing. The theoretical foundation is that INP assists wound healing by improving {{blood flow to the}} small blood vessels in the affected limb, increasing the flow of oxygen and nutrients to the cells...|$|R
