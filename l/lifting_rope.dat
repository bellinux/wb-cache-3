With the pulley attached to ceiling of the chamber, the <b>lifting</b> <b>rope</b> was tied to the wrist of the victim, whose hands were tied behind their back. Subsequently, the victim was raised to the ceiling and then lowered using a jerking motion causing dislocation of the shoulder joints.

An attempt made by Pisces V failed to find the crashed Pisces III and returned to the surface after it ran out of power. Relaunching Pisces V had more success and found the crew at 12:44 P.M. However, an attempt to attach a rope failed. Pisces V now remained with the stricken Pisces III. An attempt to send Pisces II down again had to be called off when it suffered a leak.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the ability, {{mechanism}} and problems for controlling the depth of a towed net using a canvas kite, a model test {{was carried out in}} a flume tank. The changes of the depth and attack angle of the model netting mouth, which depended on the pulling length of the <b>lifting</b> <b>rope,</b> were measured under two conditions, one in which a <b>lifting</b> <b>rope</b> was connected to a model kite (W/K) and another in which a <b>lifting</b> <b>rope</b> was directly connected {{to the top of the}} netting mouth (W/O) for purposes of comparison. The results obtained in this study were as follows. The depth decreased monotonously depending on the pulling length under the W/O condition, but it changed by decreasing or increasing under the W/K condition. The range of attack angle was from 15 to - 10 degrees in the pulling length for the effective control of the W/K condition, while in the W/O condition, the attack angle of netting mouth decreased monotonously. The primary factor of the depth control using a kite seemed to be a direction of hydraulic forces by kite on the net mouth, and a relationship between the depth and angle of net mouth was shown, but there was a negligible influence on the projected area of netting mouth in the effective control. The effective ability and mechanism of depth control using a canvas kite were also discussed with the necessity of more basic data for the development and design of the depth control system. ...|$|E
50|$|Tub boat lifts {{consisted}} of a moveable hoist travelling on four toothed wheels engaging with two toothed wooden rails, one mounted on each supporting wall. The hoist possessed two drums around which the lifting cables were wound. The <b>lifting</b> <b>ropes</b> passed through pulley blocks before being attached to lifting eyes on the boats to make the lift easier. Four men would wind the hoist when lifting a full 2.5 to 3 tonne tub boat until it was high enough to pass over the dam of the upper canal.|$|R
50|$|The {{ride was}} based on {{functional}} parachutes which were held open by metal rings throughout the ascent and descent. Twelve cantilevered steel arms sprout {{from the top of}} the tower, each of which supported a parachute attached to a <b>lift</b> <b>rope</b> and a set of surrounding guide cables. Riders were belted into a two-person canvas seat hanging below the closed chute, then hoisted to the top, where a release mechanism would drop them, the descent slowed only by the parachute. Shock absorbers at the bottom, consisting of pole-mounted springs, cushioned the landing. Each parachute required three cable operators, keeping labor expenses high.|$|R
50|$|While a pitch {{refers to}} a drop that can be descended, the term Aven is {{used to refer to}} a pitch when {{discovered}} from below. If not free-climbable, avens can be ascended by means of a bolt climb, where a caver places an ascending series of bolts in the walls and gradually ascends to the top. A rope can then be rigged to the bottom allowing following cavers to pass the obstacle. Some avens have been tackled by <b>lifting</b> <b>ropes</b> or ladders using long poles (Maypoling). Narrow avens can be climbed by pushing against opposite walls (Chimneying).|$|R
40|$|To {{suppress}} {{the swing of}} the payload, a kind of sling tray anti-swing device was designed, which reduced {{the length of the}} <b>lifting</b> <b>rope</b> to reduce the swing of payload. The kinematic equations of the payload were established under the condition of whether anti-swing device was provided, and the dynamic was carried out in Mat lab/Simulink environment. The swing of the payload under different rolling angles was analysed in a comparative manner. The results showed that the in-plane angle reduced 60 % and out -plane angle reduced 55 % of the payload {{in the case of the}} anti-swing device. The simulation results verified the effectiveness of the sling tray anti-swing device...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{reliable}} and safe use of wire rope {{is crucial for}} crane operations. Wire rope is a very useful and long lasting structural element when properly used and maintained. Therefore, wire rope safety is (or should be) a constant concern of wire rope operators and safety authorities. Safe use of the crane wire ropes depends directly on the rope condition, and on the in-time and reliable rope inspection. This study {{is focused on the}} failure analysis of crane wire ropes in service in Morocco. Wire defects and condition of a <b>lifting</b> <b>rope</b> have been studied and presented in this paper. Special attention is given to conditions that can lead to internal damage such as broken wires, wear as well as corrosion. Various nondestructive tests methods have been used in this application for wire ropes control such as visual inspection, radiographic and electromagnetic. The results of the nondestructive testing have made it possible to determine the safety status of a rope and establish preventive maintenance procedures to extend the useful life of a rope. It is concluded that maintenance, inspection and discard policy must be determined in recognition of the degradation mechanisms that operate in different rope applications.

The 20 large monasteries also had gateways, however.

These systems were built on mighty rock towers; so they were not classic elevated entrances.

40|$|To {{maintain}} {{safe operation}} of the tower crane, {{it is important to}} monitor the activities of the hook system. Visual monitoring and image recognition are the optimum methods for crane hook tracking and precision hoisting. High real-time performance and low computation requirements are required for tower crane hook capturing and tracking system which is implemented on the embedded Advanced RISC Machines (ARM) processor or Microcontrol Unit (MCU). Using the <b>lift</b> <b>rope</b> of a tower crane as the target object, a new high-performance hook tracking method suitble for ARM processor or MCU applications is presented. The features of the lifting process are analyzed, and an improved progressive probabilistic Hough transform (IPPHT) algorithm is proposed which canreduce capturing time by up to 80 %. Combining color histogram with a binary search algorithm, an adaptive zooming method for precise hoisting is presented. Using this method the optimum zoom scale can be achieved within a few iterations...|$|R
