40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{the authors}} present a noble {{heuristic}} reading machine <b>for</b> <b>blind</b> <b>people.</b> The {{goal of this}} paper is to use intelligent-control method to settle down the reading machine by a touch-pat device <b>for</b> <b>blind</b> <b>people.</b> The proposed “A noble heuristic reading device <b>for</b> <b>blind</b> people”can efficiently help <b>blind</b> <b>people</b> <b>for</b> reading and train the <b>blind</b> <b>people</b> learning the dot-touched words as well. First of all, the feedback control theorem associated with some sensors is used to accomplish the action of automatic fixed position of the reading machine. Second, a heuristic program used to analyze a certain word by converting dot-touched signals into meaningful code will transfer word-code into phonetic signals and speak out <b>for</b> <b>blind</b> <b>people</b> effectively and precisely through personal computer interface. There are three units in the proposed design, which includes the hardware structure, the analysis for certain word-meaning and the phonetic output of the specified words. The test results show that the proposed smart reading machine can effectively prompt learning and reading effects <b>for</b> <b>blind</b> <b>people.</b> Key-Words: Intelligent control method, touch-pat, heuristic program, feedback control theorem and phonetic signal, programming...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Mobile devices provide {{opportunities}} beyond communication and productivity. Particularly, they are increasingly used {{to entertain the}} nomadic user. Mobile casual games are increasingly popular as their simplicity, lack of commitment required and neglect for particular special skills goes hand-in-hand with the reduced and partitioned time spans associated with daily contexts. Gaming possibilities <b>for</b> <b>blind</b> <b>people</b> are scarce. The extra demands imposed by mobile interfaces and contexts augments this exclusion. Given the paucity of mobile games <b>for</b> <b>blind</b> <b>people</b> along with the recognized benefits of such gaming experiences, we present an audio-based puzzle game <b>for</b> <b>blind</b> <b>people.</b> In this paper, we depict the iterative (participatory) design of the game along with a preliminary evaluation with 13 blind participants. Results show that the game is fun and challenging and suggest that playable counterparts of visual-based games are feasible even in restrictive contexts as is the mobile one...|$|R
