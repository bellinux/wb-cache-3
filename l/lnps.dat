30|$|Our {{results also}} {{indicate}} that some ATL family members can interact with <b>Lnp</b> in yet to be discovered ways. For example, ATL 1 and ATL 2 bind <b>Lnp</b> much better when <b>Lnp</b> is incapable of N-myristoylation, but ATL 3 is insensitive to the G 2 A mutation. However, all these ATLs can be inhibited by <b>Lnp,</b> suggesting that the alternative ATL-Lnp interactions are likely inhibitory for ATL activity. Such interactions may explain why <b>Lnp</b> is still functional in cells that only express ATL 1, even though the characteristic puncta pattern of <b>Lnp</b> is lost in these conditions. In addition, the N-myristoylation site in <b>Lnp</b> of high eukaryotes is not conserved in yeast <b>Lnp</b> 1 p, even though the junctional targeting of <b>Lnp</b> 1 p depends on Sey 1 p. It is proposed that <b>Lnp</b> 1 p antagonizes Sey 1 p activity. If a direct impact does exist, it would occur when the NT of <b>Lnp</b> 1 p is free from membrane anchoring, thus the “NT-up” state. It is possible that <b>Lnp</b> switches between {{the up and down}} conformation; some ATLs may rely on just one mode of <b>Lnp</b> engagement, whereas other ATLs are regulated by <b>Lnp</b> in at least two ways.|$|R
30|$|Here, we {{elucidate}} {{the mechanism of}} junctional targeting of <b>Lnp.</b> We show that the NT of <b>Lnp</b> plays a key role, particularly when pairing with junctional enriched ATLs. The proposed mechanism involves recruitment of <b>Lnp</b> by ATL and inhibition of ATL by <b>Lnp.</b>|$|R

30|$|Notably, the {{regulatory}} role of <b>Lnp</b> in ER morphogenesis {{was supported by}} the expression of <b>Lnp</b> not being able to fix ER defects in DKO cells (Fig.  1 A and 1 D). Similarly, <b>Lnp</b> expression in DKO cells failed to restore amounts of junctions in a given area (Fig.  1 E). In contrast, reintroduction of ATLs into DKO cells substantially increased junction counts in cell periphery (Fig.  1 E). However, when <b>Lnp</b> was co-transfected, junction number was once again dramatically reduced (Fig.  1 E). These results confirm that <b>Lnp</b> is not capable of generating junctions, even though it is known to stabilize junctions (Chen et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016). In cases where <b>Lnp</b> becomes excessive, it might even prevent junction formation.|$|R

30|$|Three-way {{junctions}} {{are characteristic}} {{structures of the}} tubular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network. Junctions are formed through atlastin (ATL)-mediated membrane fusion and stabilized by lunapark (<b>Lnp).</b> However, how <b>Lnp</b> is preferentially enriched at three-way junctions remains elusive. Here, we showed that <b>Lnp</b> loses its junction localization when ATLs are deleted. Reintroduction of ATL 1 R 77 A and ATL 3, which {{have been shown to}} cluster at the junctions, but not wild-type ATL 1, relocates <b>Lnp</b> to the junctions. Mutations in the N-myristoylation site or hydrophobic residues in the coiled coil (CC 1) of <b>Lnp</b> N-terminus (NT) cause mis-targeting of <b>Lnp.</b> Conversely, deletion of the lunapark motif in the C-terminal zinc finger domain, which affects the homo-oligomerization of <b>Lnp,</b> does not alter its localization. Purified Lnp-NT attaches to the membrane in a myristoylation-dependent manner. The mutation of hydrophobic residues in CC 1 does not affect membrane association, but compromises ATL interactions. In addition, Lnp-NT inhibits ATL-mediated vesicle fusion in vitro. These results suggest that CC 1 in Lnp-NT contacts junction-enriched ATLs for proper localization; subsequently, further ATL activity is limited by <b>Lnp</b> after the junction is formed. The proposed mechanism ensures coordinated actions of ATL and <b>Lnp</b> in generating and maintaining three-way junctions.|$|R

Lipid nanoparticles (<b>LNPs)</b> are the leading systems for the delivery of siRNA in vivo. Limit size <b>LNPs</b> were successfully synthesized using a microfluidic mixing technique. However, the physicochemical properties and potential for in vivo siRNA delivery of the limit-size <b>LNPs</b> have not been examined in detail. In the present study, we prepared <b>LNPs</b> with different diameters from 32 to 67 nm using a microfluidic mixing devise and examined the physicochemical properties of the particles and the potential for their use in delivering siRNA in vitro and in vivo to liver. Reducing the size of the <b>LNPs</b> causes poor-packing and an increased surface area, which result in their instability in serum. Moreover, it was revealed that the ability of endosomal escape (cytosolic siRNA release) of the smaller <b>LNPs</b> is subject to inhibition by serum compared to that of larger counterparts. Taken together, an increase in packing and avoiding the adsorption of serum components are key strategies for the development of next-generation highly potent and small-sized <b>LNPs.</b> (C) 2016 Elsevier B.

40|$|A {{limited number}} of siRNA and mRNA based {{therapeutics}} have been developed {{largely due to the}} difficulties of efficaciously delivering RNA to cells in vivo. Liposomal nanoparticles (<b>LNPs)</b> have shown some success, but their design is limited by both a lack of information concerning the optimal lipid composition and insufficient data regarding the LNPs' interaction with their environment. Further elucidation of the physical properties of <b>LNPs</b> as well as their mechanisms of action will improve future development of RNA therapeutics. Using a combinatorial lipid library, we identified four design criteria that are required for efficacious LNP delivery of siRNA: the presence of a tertiary amine, having lipid tails that are 13 carbons long, having three or more lipid tails, and having an LNP pKa of 5. 4 or more. <b>LNPs</b> meeting all four of these conditions demonstrated 100 % probability of efficaciously delivering siRNA to hepatocytes in vivo. While numerous <b>LNPs</b> have been developed for siRNA delivery, few have been developed for mRNA delivery. Utilizing <b>LNPs</b> optimized for siRNA to deliver mRNA instead could rapidly reduce development time and cost for mRNA therapeutics. Here, we demonstrate that the relative efficacy of 48 different ionizable lipids were comparable for both siRNA and mRNA delivery, but that several formulation parameters must be modified for optimal mRNA delivery. These include a lower molar percent of the ionizable lipid, having a higher total lipid to RNA weight ratio, and containing conical phospholipids instead of cylindrical phospholipids. Using <b>LNPs</b> to deliver RNA to cells other than hepatocytes has proven difficult. By incorporating a positive surface charge on the <b>LNPs</b> we redirected liver targeted liposomes to lung endothelial cells. Examination of the plasma proteins bound to the <b>LNPs</b> revealed apolipoprotein (Apo) B and ApoE attached to the hepatocellular targeted <b>LNPs,</b> with serum albumin and fibrinogen were bound to the lung targeted <b>LNPs,</b> and ApoAl found on both types of <b>LNPs.</b> Subsequent in vitro experiments demonstrated that VLDL and HDL are important for hepatocellular and lung endothelial cell delivery, respectively.

30|$|To {{assess the}} {{involvement}} of the CT in <b>Lnp</b> localization, we transfected various CT mutants into COS- 7 cells and monitored their localization. Deletion of the entire ZnF or just the LNPARK motif did not change the junction enrichment of <b>Lnp</b> (Fig.  4 C), suggesting that self-oligomerization is dispensable for <b>Lnp</b> localization. Consistent with these findings, substitution of the four conserved cysteines in the ZnF domain with serines had little impact on <b>Lnp</b> localization (Fig.  4 C). We also tested whether CT-mediated oligomerization is important for ER morphogenesis. When three CT mutants were transfected individually into Lnp-deleted cells, none of them were able to generate the proper shape of the tubular ER network (Fig.  4 D and 4 E; see Fig. S 5 C for expression levels). Consistently, these <b>Lnp</b> mutants failed to reduce ER expansion caused by <b>Lnp</b> deletion (Fig.  4 F).|$|R
30|$|Proper {{localization}} of <b>Lnp</b> may {{be critical}} for its regulation of ER morphology. Previous conventional confocal imaging showed that deletion of <b>Lnp</b> in mammalian cells induces sheet expansion (Wang et al., 2016), whereas deletion of <b>Lnp</b> 1 p in yeast causes {{the accumulation of}} junctions (Chen et al., 2012). In light of recent observations made by super resolution microscopy, which suggest that some ER sheets are actually tubular junction clusters (Nixon-Abell et al., 2016), we suspected that the peripheral sheets observed in mammalian <b>Lnp</b> deletion may be clusters of junctions. To this end, we generated Lnp-deleted COS- 7 cells using the CRISPR/Cas 9 system (Fig. S 4 A) and performed gazing incidence structural illumination microscopy (GI-SIM). Loss of <b>Lnp</b> led to sheets with uniform signals (Fig. S 4 B), confirming that <b>Lnp</b> deletion increases peripheral sheets.|$|R
