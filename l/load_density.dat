No differences in the relative growth rates and food conversion were found between fish reared at the high (2. 6 kg l(- 1) min) and low loading rates (0. 6 kg l(- 1) min).

50|$|Density of loading {{refers to}} the mass of an {{explosive}} per unit volume. Several methods of loading are available, including pellet loading, cast loading, and press loading, the choice being determined by {{the characteristics of the}} explosive. Dependent upon the method employed, an average density of the loaded charge can be obtained that is within 80-99% of the theoretical maximum density of the explosive. High <b>load</b> <b>density</b> can reduce sensitivity by making the mass more resistant to internal friction. However, if density is increased to the extent that individual crystals are crushed, the explosive may become more sensitive. Increased <b>load</b> <b>density</b> also permits the use of more explosive, thereby increasing the power of the warhead. It is possible to compress an explosive beyond a point of sensitivity, known also as dead-pressing, in which the material is no longer capable of being reliably initiated, if at all.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Load</b> <b>density</b> is the {{percentage}} of the space in the cartridge case that is filled with powder. In general, loads close to 100% density (or even loads where seating the bullet in the case, compresses the powder) ignite and burn more consistently than lower-density loads. In cartridges surviving from the black-powder era (examples being [...]45 Colt, [...]45-70 Government), the case is much larger than is needed to hold the maximum charge of high-density smokeless powder. This extra room allows the powder to shift in the case, piling up near the front or back of the case and potentially causing significant variations in burning rate, as powder near the rear of the case will ignite rapidly but powder near the front of the case will ignite later. This change has less impact with fast powders. Such high-capacity, low-density cartridges generally deliver best accuracy with the fastest appropriate powder, although this keeps the total energy low due to the sharp high-pressure peak.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{results of}} a fire <b>load</b> <b>density</b> survey carried out in Ouro Preto {{in the state of}} Minas Gerais, Brazil are presented. The {{inventory}} method is used and details of the survey methodology and processing are given. Forty-three buildings are surveyed and the determination of fire <b>load</b> <b>density</b> is made for 39 occupancies, each occupancy comprising one or more rooms, or even an entire building. The average fire <b>load</b> <b>density</b> is 2989 MJ/m 2 and the standard deviation is 2833 MJ/m 2. Commercial stores are found to be the most heavily loaded but a single maximum fire <b>load</b> <b>density</b> of 14, 560 MJ/m 2 is found in a drugstore. Because of new extensions of old buildings, some rooms have relatively low fire loads. It is observed that wood contributes a substantial portion of fire load, being 35 % of movable fire load and 37 % of fixed fire load. Comparison of the results, with those established by Brazilian standard NBR 14432, indicate that measured values could exceed standard values by up to a factor of 10.

Water samples were collected before and after transport to measure dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH and ammonia levels. Blood samples were taken at departure and arrival, as well as at 24 and 96 hours after transport to monitor cortisol, glucose, ammonia, chloride and hematocrit levels. Water ammonia levels were found to increase gradually as <b>loading</b> <b>densities</b> increased. Plasma ammonia was higher after transport in fish from all treatments. Compared to initial values, substantial increases in plasma cortisol and ammonia levels were detected mainly in those fish submitted to the highest <b>loading</b> <b>density.</b> Blood glucose appeared to be positively influenced by the increase of transport densities. No statistical differences were observed in any of the other blood parameters. The costs in fish culture, as in other animal production systems, must be minimized and fish producers depend on optimal techniques to ensure better profit.

40|$|Methods {{to control}} the {{development}} of toxic by-products in the water were evaluated for various pet-fish species enclosed in polyethylene bags overlayed with oxygen. A formula of three components was developed that decreased the concentration of ammonia and carbon dioxide, controlled bacterial growth, and maintained a higher pH compared with untreated controls held under similar conditions. Clinoptilolite at 14 g/liter controlled the ammonia accumulation, tris buffer (0. 017 M) at pH 8. 0 controlled the accumulation of free CO 2, and neomycin sulfate at 20 mg/liter prevented bacterial blooms. Fish were held up to 48 hours and at <b>loading</b> <b>densities</b> up to 180 g/liter with favorable results. Field tests of the formulation were conducted by air-transporting several species of pet fish from either Florida or east Asia to Seattle, Washington at <b>loading</b> <b>densities</b> that averaged 102 and 87 g/liter, respectively. The average transit time from Asia was longer than shipments from Florida, 36 hours compared to 22 hours.

However, better control occurred in the Florida tests when the transit time was shorter. In addition, mortality was reduced.

Prolonged shaking simulating extended periods of egg transport also resulted in low egg survival and hatching rates compared to fertilized eggs not subjected to simulated transport. Egg survival after simulated transport at 20 Â°C was lower than at 28 Â°C, except at 20 ppt salinity, where survival was equal. Egg survival at 20 Â°C progressively increased with declining salinity levels whereas high egg survival rates were observed after 2 h of simulated egg transport at 28 Â°C and at the three salinities tested. Hatching rates of fertilized eggs after simulated transport were higher at 28 Â°C than at 20 Â°C regardless of salinity. Neither salinity nor its interaction with temperature affected hatching rates of eggs after simulated transport.

The overall desirability was 0. 78. Keywords- Multi layer-cum-microwave drying, optimization, {{oyster mushroom}}, quality. I...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} some key {{parameters}} in design of lithium sulfur batteries with high energy density, in particular carbon/sulfur ratio, sulfur <b>loading</b> <b>density,</b> electrolyte volume and electrode deformability, which directly impact the battery performance in terms of capacity, cycleability, and processibilities, etc. We find that a carbon to sulfur ratio of 1 : 2 (w/w) in the electrode is good for high specific capacity, giving a capacity of 538 mA h g- 1 which is 3 times as high as that of LiCoO 2 cathode. The issue of fragileness for electrode at high sulfur <b>loading</b> <b>density</b> is mitigated by replacing carbon black with fine graphite powders. With these optimizations the carbon-sulfur electrode gives an energy density of 5. 88 mW h cm- 2 which corresponds to 60 % of that of the commercial LiCoO 2 electrode. © 2014 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|To use {{peptides}} as synthetic vaccines, {{they have}} to be coupled to a carrier protein to make them more immunogenic. Coupling efficiency between a carrier protein and a peptide, however, is difficult to control with respect to <b>loading</b> <b>density</b> of the peptide. This makes these carrier proteins poorly suitable for practicle use. Attempts have been reported to find carrier molecules or delivery systems which allow easy coupling or incorporation of peptides, reproducible <b>loading</b> <b>densities</b> and well defined products. We compared several promising constructs or delivery systems by immunization of male pigs using a tandem GnRH peptide as a branched polylysine construct, a lipo-thioester, a lipo-amide or a KLH conjugate in CFA, and the lipoamide peptide in an immuno-stimulating complex (ISCOM). We found the lipo-thioester and the branched polylysine constructs to be the most effective carrier molecules for the induction of antibodies against GnRH and immunocastration of pigs...|$|R
