40|$|Decision {{making is}} an {{important}} function of management and to facilitate decision making that is relevant to any organisation, {{it is imperative that}} managers have the correct information at the right time. Since the 1990 ?s, the Transport Systems and Operations research group at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) started developing a Management Information System to assist road traffic authorities and vehicle <b>load</b> <b>control</b> <b>centres</b> in decision making. A management information system is a combination of devices, software, data and procedures designed to address the collection and processing of information with the aim of providing management with relevant information for decision making purposes. This paper describes a management information system (MIS) developed and implemented in the Western Cape Province since 2006 and recently in KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa, to assist road authorities with heavy vehicle <b>load</b> <b>control.</b> Since its implementation in the Western Cape average overloads has shown reduction from 755 kg in 2006 to 529 kg in 2015, part of the reduction in average overloads can be credited {{to the use of the}} MIS. The benefits gained by the road authorities are many and includes the ability to identify operational problems in near real time; monitor scale operator?s performance; to identify problematic hauliers who overload vehicles deliberately; to monitor operational performance and schedule shifts accordingly. The management information system has proved to be successful and useful, as management is able to track irregularities and reduce corruption. Operational performance has improved as underlined by management increasingly requesting training of scale operators to bridge the gaps identified by the system.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to assess a new method of <b>controlling</b> <b>load</b> in Intelligent Networks (INs). This will be done through the {{analysis}} of experimentation results and comparison with existing methods of IN <b>load</b> <b>control.</b> This exercise {{will result in the}} investigation and validation of the proposed benefits being offered by this new methodology and the unveiling of its disadvantages. The methodology is known as network-orientated <b>load</b> <b>control</b> for the IN. Network-orientated <b>load</b> <b>control</b> is demonstrated using the MARINER Service Traffic <b>Load</b> <b>Control</b> System developed by the European Commission’s Advanced Communication, Technologies and Services (ACTS) Multi-Agent Architecture for Distributed Intelligent Network <b>Load</b> <b>Control</b> and Overload Protection (MARINER) Project. This system is shown to be a network-orientated <b>load</b> <b>control</b> application operating at the service level, built specifically for Intelligent Networks. Network-orientated <b>load</b> <b>control</b> is then assessed by deploying the MARINER System on a model of the IN, and running an exhaustive series of experiments. These experiments are structured to test the proposed benefits, limitations and disadvantages of networkorientated <b>load</b> <b>control.</b> The conclusions drawn from the results of these trials are then compared with existing IN <b>load</b> <b>control</b> characteristics, and used to make an assessment of network-orientated <b>load</b> <b>control</b> for the Intelligent Network...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} a design of pilot-assisted <b>load</b> <b>control</b> valve with <b>load</b> velocity <b>control</b> ability and fast opening feature based on static and dynamic modeling. Traditional <b>load</b> <b>control</b> valves {{do not have}} the <b>load</b> velocity <b>control</b> ability and its opening feature is very poor because the high spring stiffness comes along with the pressure–spring balance–based principle. Some improvement has been done by employing a two-stage pressure–pressure balance principle to make a <b>load</b> <b>control</b> valve to achieve <b>load</b> velocity <b>control</b> ability while the opening feature was not improved much. In this design, another pressure–pressure balance principle is proposed to make the <b>load</b> <b>control</b> valve achieve <b>load</b> velocity <b>control</b> ability and fast opening closing feature at the same time. Static modeling method based on force balance and Bernoulli orifice pressure-flow equation is used to design the <b>load</b> velocity <b>control</b> ability of the valve. Dynamic modeling method based on Newton’s second law and fluid continuity equation is used to optimize the parameters to give the proposed <b>load</b> <b>control</b> valve a fast opening feature. An actual <b>load</b> <b>control</b> valve was developed according to the above methods and the test results show both good <b>load</b> velocity <b>control</b> ability and fast opening feature of the design, which validates the potentiality of the proposed design in many applications...|$|R

40|$|Frequency {{regulation}} and generation-load balancing are key issues in power transmission networks. Complementary to generation <b>control,</b> <b>loads</b> provide flexible and fast responsive sources for frequency regulation, and local frequency measurement capability of loads offers {{the opportunity of}} decentralized control. In this paper, we propose an optimal <b>load</b> <b>control</b> problem, which balances the load reduction (or increase) with the generation shortfall (or surplus), resynchronizes the bus frequencies, and minimizes a measure of aggregate disutility of participation in such a <b>load</b> <b>control.</b> We find that, a frequency-based <b>load</b> <b>control</b> coupled with the dynamics of swing equations and branch power flows serve as a distributed primal-dual algorithm to solve the optimal <b>load</b> <b>control</b> problem and its dual. Simulation shows that the proposed mechanism can restore frequency, balance load with generation and achieve the optimum of the <b>load</b> <b>control</b> problem within several seconds after a disturbance in generation. Through simulation, we also compare the performance of optimal <b>load</b> <b>control</b> with automatic generation control (AGC), and discuss the effect of their incorporation...|$|R
