We abstracted HIV viral loads for HIV-infected males aged 24 years or younger with {{a diagnosis of}} early syphilis (ES) in Maricopa County, Arizona, in order to evaluate HIV infectivity. During 2009 to 2012, there were 56 HIV-infected, ES cases meet-ing the age criteria, of whom 32 (57 %) had a detectable viral load performed within 1 year of syphilis diagnosis (median 21 000 copies/mL, range 130 - 302 844 copies/mL). Only 4 (7 %) of the 56 patients had an undetectable viral load (< 100 copies/mL) reported {{within a year of}} syphilis diagnosis. Twenty (36 %) had no reported viral load or a viral <b>load</b> <b>collected</b> after 1 year of syphilis diagnosis.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the last}} few years, many studies have used {{airborne}} pollen to record the flowering season of plants. However, the airborne pollen found in traps does not always originate from or reflect the flowering period of the taxa from the studied surroundings.

40|$|To {{investigate}} how bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) learn the complex motor skills involved in pollen foraging, we observed naÃ¯ve workers foraging on arrays of nectarless poppy flowers (Papaver rhoeas) in a greenhouse. Foraging skills were quantified {{by measuring the}} pollen <b>load</b> <b>collected</b> during each foraging bout and relating this {{to the number of}} flowers visited and bout duration on two consecutive days. The pollen standing crop (PSC) in each flower decreased drastically from 0530 to 0900 hours. Therefore, we related foraging performance to the changing levels of pollen available (per flower) and found that collection rate increased over the course of four consecutive foraging bouts (comprising between 277 and 354 individual flower visits), suggesting that learning to forage for pollen represents a substantial time investment for individual foragers. The pollen collection rate and size of pollen <b>loads</b> <b>collected</b> at the start of day 2 were markedly lower than at the end of day 1, suggesting that components of pollen foraging behaviour could be subject to imperfect overnight retention. Our results suggest that learning the necessary motor skills to collect pollen effectively from morphologically simple flowers takes three times as many visits as learning how to handle the most morphologically complex flowers to extract nectar, potentially explaining why bees are more specialised in their choice of pollen flowers...|$|R

This perception of Calhoun changed under the popular Master Charles Schroeder, who once remarked that if the despicable trolley service were ever removed he would purchase a trolley car, put it in the courtyard, and hold a celebration to commemorate the event. The trolley system was indeed removed in 1949, and though a whole car proved unfeasible, Master Schroder secured the fare <b>collecting</b> <b>machine</b> from a trolley and made good on his promise to celebrate.

30|$|Additionally, cow manure is a {{potential}} feedstock {{for the production of}} lignocellulosic ethanol not only because of its high lignocellulosic content but also because of its growing volume and convenient collection (Diaz et al. 2016). Compared with periodical corn stover collection, daily regular solid waste collection is more cost effective using an automated <b>collecting</b> <b>machine</b> of manure at its source. However, the distributed nature of corn stover has caused the substrate costs in ethanol production to average at $ 60 per ton (Johnson et al. 2016). Therefore, the easy and regular collection and abundant sources of cow manure could reduce the cost of bioethanol production and ultimately maintain high process stability and favorable conditions for rapid bioethanol production.|$|R
