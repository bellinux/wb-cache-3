5|$|The North Korean People's Army {{was able}} to {{maintain}} transport to its front lines over <b>long</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> communications despite heavy and constant air attacks. The United Nations air effort failed to halt military rail transport. Ammunition and motor fuel, which took precedence over all other types of supply, continued {{to arrive at the}} front, though in smaller amounts than before. There was still a considerable resupply of heavy weapons, such as tanks, artillery, and mortars, at the front in early September, although a steady decline in artillery can be traced from the middle of August. There was a sufficient supply of small arms ammunition, but a shortage of small arms themselves became apparent by mid-August and continued to worsen with each passing week. Rear areas were able to fill only about one third of the requisitions from the front for small arms in mid-August and resupply ceased entirely about the middle of September. New trucks were almost impossible to obtain. There was no resupply of clothing. At best there were rations for only one or two meals a day. Most units had to live at least partially off the South Korean populace, scavenging for food and supplies at night. By September 1 the food situation was so bad in the North Korean Army at the front that most of the soldiers showed a loss of stamina with resulting impaired combat effectiveness. At the same time, seriously wounded North Korean soldiers were often not transported to the rear for medical services, and many died while stranded on the front line.|$|E
5|$|The {{supremacy}} of the Fifth Air Force {{in the skies}} over Korea forced the North Koreans {{in the first month}} of the war to resort to night movement of supplies to the battle area. They relied primarily on railroads to move supplies to the front, however a shortage of trucks posed the most serious problem of getting supplies from the trains to individual units, forcing them to rely on carts and pack animals.

25|$|By mid-century, Henderson County {{had become}} a major {{producer}} of tobacco, much of which was exported to Great Britain. The area {{was reported to be}} the largest dark tobacco producer in the world; large tobacco warehouses and stemmeries dotted the downtown Henderson area. Postcards from the era show <b>long</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> horse- and mule-drawn wagons piled high with tobacco, waiting their turn to unload for shipment downriver.

25|$|During 1990, in {{the capital}} city of Mogadishu, the {{residents}} were prohibited from gathering publicly in groups greater than three or four. Fuel shortages caused <b>long</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> cars at petrol stations. Inflation had driven the price of pasta (ordinary dry Italian noodles, a staple at that time) to five U.S. dollars per kilogram. The price of khat, imported daily from Kenya, was also five U.S. dollars per standard bunch. Paper currency notes were of such low value that several bundles were needed to pay for simple restaurant meals.|$|E
25|$|In December 1942 Dempsey was {{promoted}} to lieutenant general to command XIII Corps of the British Eighth Army in North Africa. Montgomery, the Eighth Army commander, had first spotted Dempsey's potential {{when he had been}} one of his students at the Staff College. On arrival in Cairo, Egypt, Dempsey found his corps HQ in reserve because the <b>long</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> communication to Eighth Army's spearhead could only sustain two corps (XXX Corps and X Corps).

25|$|The Olympic Park stadium, {{home to the}} Melbourne Storm in the {{national}} rugby league, was once the precinct of the Friendly Society Gardens.

Birrarung Marr has been designed to incorporate <b>long</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> sight towards various, such as the spire at the Victorian Arts Centre and the towers of St Paul's Cathedral.

25|$|Taco Bell {{was founded}} by Glen Bell, who first opened a hot dog stand called Bell's Drive-In in San Bernardino, California in 1946 when he was 23 years old. In 1950, he opened Bell's Hamburgers and Hot Dogs in San Bernardino's West Side barrio. According to Gustavo Arellano, author of Taco USA: How Mexican Food Conquered America, Bell watched <b>long</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> {{customers}} at a Mexican restaurant called the Mitla Cafe, located across the street, which attracted a dedicated customer base for its hard-shelled tacos. Bell began eating there regularly, attempting to reverse-engineer the recipe, and eventually won {{the confidence of the}} proprietors such that they allowed him to see how the tacos and other foods were prepared. In late 1951 or early 1952, he took what he had learned and opened a new stand, this time selling tacos under the name of Taco-Tia.|$|E

500|$|The most {{controversial}} move was Hitchcock's [...] "no late admission" [...] {{policy for the}} film, which was unusual for the time. It was not entirely original as Clouzot {{had done the same}} in France for Diabolique. Hitchcock thought that if people entered the theater late and never saw the star actress Janet Leigh, they would feel cheated. At first theater owners opposed the idea, claiming that they would lose business. However, after the first day, the owners enjoyed <b>long</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> people waiting to see the film.|$|E

500|$|... "Cry" [...] was {{promoted}} by a music video, or [...] "short film," [...] as Jackson would refer to it.

The video was filmed in six different locations, all were filmed in California. People featured in the video included members of a real life gospel group. The video begins with dozens of people of different ages, ethnicities and races holding hands. <b>Long</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> people were stretched over mountains, across highways, in a forest and on the beach. Everyone stands in silence for a majority of the video. Following the bridge, everyone begins singing the chorus.

500|$|The video used soft focus, gentle {{lighting}} and airbrushing looks on Madonna. It starts with Timbaland chanting the opening line {{in front of}} a giant timer screen that counts down from four minutes. As he sings, a black geometric patterned screen comes from behind and engulfs all of the musical devices present. Madonna and Timberlake enter a house but run away from it after finding the screen there, which starts eating the hands and legs of the inhabitants of the house, thus showing their insides. After a number of shots showing Madonna and Timberlake jumping on and over cars to escape from the screen, they finally move into a supermarket. The screen follows them, consuming the <b>long</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> stalls and the people present there. As the second chorus starts, they arrive in front of the screen where Timbaland is singing. After choreographed dancing, Madonna performs a back arch as the timer reaches zero time. The last [...] "tick-tock, tick-tock" [...] sound is heard, Madonna and Timberlake dance again on a long stage; the black screen approaches them from both sides. The video ends with both of them kissing, and the black screen devouring them. Timberlake's bones and ribs, and Madonna's cheeks are seen in the last shot.|$|E
500|$|Writer John Shiban was {{inspired}} to write the episode after noticing the <b>long</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> migrant workers he would often see at his job when working as a computer programmer in the Los Angeles area. He combined it with an idea he had about a contagious fungus. Shiban originally intended to have the fungal infection spread by a schoolkid, but later changed it to a trucker in the second draft. In the finalized script, it was changed to Eladio once the storylines were combined. Executive producer and series creator Chris Carter was attracted to the soap opera-like aspects of the episode, and {{the title of the}} episode means [...] "The World Turns" [...] in Spanish, a reference to the popular American television soap opera As the World Turns. The Chupacabra is a Latin American folk myth that Shiban originally heard about in an article in The Los Angeles Times about a year prior. To research the episode, Shiban spent time observing the processing of illegal aliens at an INS facility in San Pedro, California. The usage of fake names by the detained immigrants in the episode {{was inspired}} by his experiences at the facility. Lozano was portrayed by popular Panamanian salsa singer and actor Ruben Blades. Chris Carter had been looking to use him in an episode for a while. The actors who portrayed Eladio and Gabrielle were a couple at the time.|$|E
