25|$|On February 16, 1970, Frazier faced WBA Champion Jimmy Ellis at Madison Square Garden. Ellis had outpointed Jerry Quarry in {{the final}} bout of the WBA {{elimination}} tournament for Ali's vacated belt. Frazier had himself declined {{to participate in the}} WBA tournament to protest their decision to strip Ali. Ellis held an impressive win over Oscar Bonavena among others. Beforehand, Ali had announced his retirement and relinquished the Heavyweight title, allowing Ellis and Frazier to fight for the undisputed title. Frazier won by a TKO when Ellis's trainer Angelo Dundee would not <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>come</b> out for the 5th round following two 4th round knockdowns (the first knockdowns of Ellis's career). Frazier's decisive win over Ellis was a frightening display of power and tenacity.|$|E
500|$|... "Amor Puro" [...] (Pure Love) is {{in a minor}} key with romantic lyrics, {{a string}} {{ensemble}} and techno synthesizers. Its lyrics focus {{on the meaning of}} true love. Queen sings: [...] "Pure love does not fight, it does not hurt you, love that is pure does not cause you to fall", and described the song as [...] "an honest statement of what love is". [...] "I Do" [...] is a minor-key, mid-tempo pop and R power ballad built on a handclapped rhythm and piano. Lyrically, the song is a message to men and women; Queen sings: [...] "My ladies, if you know better, if he loves you, <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>come</b> back. My fellas, if you love her, don't let nothing hold you back, run out and look for her". Queen recorded the song in English because she felt the language worked well with the beat. According to an editor for iTunes, the song [...] "puts her message of female empowerment into a glossy pop ballad, complete with English lyrics and Auto-Tuned vocal." [...] The minor-key [...] "Acércate" [...] (Get Closer) features vocals by Wisin & Yandel and synthesizers; it has been described as [...] "pure reggaeton". The song was praised for the presence of Wisin & Yandel and its hook. Queen previously collaborated with Wisin & Yandel on their seventh studio album, La Revolución (2009), with [...] "Perfecto" [...] (which also featured Yaviah).|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} no other people sent to perform a {{religious}} duty and risk their lives on a mission could compare with the two spies whom Joshua sent. The Rabbis taught that the two were Phinehas and Caleb. The Midrash noted that [...] says, [...] "Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two spies secretly" [...] ( [...] , cheresh). The Midrash read the word , cheresh ("secretly"), as , chares, [...] "earthenware", to teach that the two spies took with them earthenware pots and cried, [...] "Here are pots! Whoever wishes, <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>come</b> and buy!" [...] {{so that no one}} might detect them or say that they were spies.|$|E

2500|$|Finally, Senzô arrives {{to reclaim}} his wife. [...] Makoto is {{surprised}} when Shizuko moves to her husband's side eagerly.

[...] However, she offers to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>come</b> with the two of them, and though hesitant, Makoto agrees. [...] Miyo begs her son not to go, but the three pile into Senzô's vehicle and leave, a distraught Miyo running after the vehicle in vain.

2500|$|The band's second single, [...] "People Say", {{which was}} {{recorded}} in May 1979, was produced by The Go-Betweens with Mustapha on drums and Malcolm Kelly on piano and organ. The B-side, [...] "Don't <b>Let</b> <b>Him</b> <b>Come</b> Back", is a farewell to Walsh, who remained friends with Forster and McLennan. From May 1978 to May 1979, the group recorded some tracks live in Forster's bedroom using McLennan's two-track tape deck—they were not released until 1999 as 78 'Til 79: The Lost Album, which also includes {{both sides of the}} first two singles. These songs were simple pop tunes with a rough new wave edge, an obvious blend of pure pop influences such as The Monkees with the gritty simplicity of The Velvet Underground.|$|E
2500|$|Thérèse {{entered the}} Carmel of Lisieux with the {{determination}} to become a saint. But, {{by the end of}} 1894, six full calendar years as a Carmelite made her realize how small and insignificant she was. She saw the limitations of all her efforts. She remained small and very far off from the unfailing love that she would wish to practice. [...] She understood then that it was on this very littleness that she must learn to ask God's help. [...] Along with her camera, Céline had brought notebooks with her, passages from the Old Testament, which Thérèse did not have in Carmel. (The Louvain Bible, the translation authorized for French Catholics, did not include an Old Testament). In the notebooks Thérèse found a passage from Proverbs that struck her with particular force: [...] "Whosoever is a little one, <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>come</b> to me" [...] (...) [...]|$|E

2500|$|The {{broader context}} of the talks {{remained}} confused. The government of Southern Sudan views the talks {{as a means of}} ridding itself of a foreign army that is complicating their delicate relationship with the Khartoum government. The request by the Ugandan Government for ICC to suspend war crimes indictments against leaders of the LRA, condemned by international human rights groups but largely supported by leaders and civilians within northern Uganda, led some political analysts to see Ugandan Government's request as a ploy to gain local support. [...] The comment of a George Olara, an IDP living in a camp in Pader, was fairly typical: [...] "He [...] should not be taken to The Hague. <b>Let</b> <b>him</b> <b>come</b> back and live with the community because this is how reconciliation will be achieved. ... Peace will come if the talks succeed, but there is the potential that they may also fail like they have done before".|$|E

2500|$|Small in stature, {{he lacked}} the overall power of his larger {{competitors}} such as Don Budge and Kramer but made up for it with brains, ball control, and speed. A master court strategist and tactician, he worked his opponent out of position and scored points with the game's best drop shot and lob as well as punishing ground strokes that <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>come</b> to the net for put-away shots. [...] Kramer, {{one of the very}} few players who was undeniably better than Riggs, writes that there is a major [...] "misconception" [...] about Riggs. [...] "He didn't play some rinky-dink Harold Solomon style, pitty-pattying the ball around on dirt. [...] He didn't have the big serve, but he made up for it with some sneaky first serves and as fine a second serve as I had seen at that time. [...] When you talk about depth and accuracy both, Riggs' second serve ranks with the other three best that I ever saw: von Cramm's, Gonzales's, and Newcombe's." [...] In his own autobiography, Riggs wrote, [...] "In the 1946 match with Budge , I charged the net at every opportunity. [...] Employing what I called my secret weapon, a hard first serve, I attacked constantly during my 6–3, 6–1, 6–1 victory." ...|$|E

2500|$|He also {{furnished}} {{his voice}} in The Guess Who's 1974 tribute, the top 40 hit single, [...] "Clap for the Wolfman". A few years earlier, Todd Rundgren recorded a similar tribute, [...] "Wolfman Jack", on the album Something/Anything?; the single version of the track includes a shouted talk-over intro by the Wolfman but on the album version Rundgren performs that part himself. Canadian band The Stampeders also released a cover of [...] "Hit the Road Jack" [...] in 1975 featuring Wolfman Jack; the storyline of the song involved a man named [...] "Cornelius" [...] calling Jack on the phone, telling him {{the story of how}} his girlfriend had thrown him out of the house, and trying to persuade Jack to <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>come</b> and stay with him (at this point, Jack ended the call). His voice is also featured in the song [...] "Did You Boogie (With Your Baby)" [...] by Flash Cadillac & the Continental Kids (Billboard HOT 100 peak #29 in October 1976) and an imitation of him is featured as a cameo in [...] "Don't Call Us, We'll Call You" [...] by Sugarloaf (Billboard HOT 100 peak #9 in March 1975). In September 1975, Wolfman Jack appeared on stage with the Stampeders (singing [...] "Hit the Road Jack") as a warm-up act for the Beach Boys at the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto, Canada and that same year he also performed [...] "Don't Call Us, We'll Call You" [...] with Sugarloaf on The Midnight Special.

2500|$|Following {{the close}} of {{probation}} will be a [...] "time of trouble", which will be a period of intense conflict and persecution for God's people (Revelation 13:15-17; 7:14). Shortly afterward, Christ will return in glory (1 Thessalonians 4:15-17; 2 Thessalonians 1:7-10) and raise the righteous dead (the [...] "first resurrection", Revelation 20:4-5), whom he will take to heaven together with the righteous living to share his millennial reign (Revelation 20:6). Just who these [...] "righteous" [...] are will, of course, have been revealed {{during the course of}} the Investigative Judgment. [...] During the millennium, Satan will be imprisoned on earth alone with his demons (Revelation 20:1-3). [...] During this period God's redeemed will be in heaven, having 1000 years to examine the books of Judgment for themselves, ensuring that God has acted fairly in His dealings with humanity. [...] Judgment is committed to those who have walked in human shoes to ensure that the lost have indeed rejected God (Revelation 20:4). [...] At the end of the millennium, Christ will again return to earth with His redeemed to raise the wicked (the [...] "second resurrection", Revelation 20:5). [...] Satan will then deceive the wicked into attacking God's people (Revelation 20:7-9). [...] At this time, Christ will sit down in final Executive Judgment and the books will be open for all (sinner and saved alike) to see and judge (Revelation 20:11-13). Once all have acknowledged the justice and love of God, the execution of the judgment proceeds. [...] Having already thrown Satan and his demonic henchmen into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:10), God now consigns those who have rejected forgiveness to incineration and eternal death (Revelation 20:15). [...] Those who have accepted forgiveness inherit a recreated, perfect, new earth. (Revelation 21:1-5). [...] Adventists feel that their eschatological message is to sound the cry of Revelation 22:17: [...] "The Spirit and the bride say, 'Come.' [...] And let him who hears say, 'Come.'
