40|$|The El Teniente Cu-Mo {{porphyry}} deposit, Chile, {{is one of}} the world’s {{largest and}} most complex porphyry ore systems, containing an estimated premining resource of approximately 95 Mt Cu and 2. 5 Mt Mo. Although Cu mineralization at the deposit is quite well studied, little work has focused specifically on the distribution and timing of Mo mineralization. Combined grade, vein, and breccia distribution analysis reveals that deposit-wide Mo grades of 0. 01 to 0. 06 wt % are strongly controlled by the abundance of main mineralization (type 6 a) quartz ± molybdenite veins. These show a clear spatial relationship with several felsic-intermediate intrusions and appear to develop outward and upward into Cu-rich (type 6 b– 7 b) quartz-chalcopyrite veins and (type 8) chalcopyrite-anhydrite ± bornite veins with sericitic alteration halos. High-precision Re-Os molybdenite dating reveals that these <b>linked</b> <b>vein</b> types did not develop in a single, deposit-wide evolution, but are diachronous, related to distinct episodes of hydrothermal activity associated with the emplacement of diorite finger porphy-ries and the composite Teniente Dacite Porphyry. These units acted as effective, short-lived (< 100, 000 years) conduits for pulses of Mo- and Cu-bearing hydrothermal fluids between 6. 3 and 4. 6 Ma. The rapid thermal contraction of each system during mineralization led to extensive overprinting of Mo-rich veins by their lower-temperature, Cu-rich equivalents.

Gold values become of economic interest, especially along a 2 meter thick lowermost part of the placers. Amount of gold increases parallel to the heavy mineral content of the placers, reaching a maximum in 0. 63 mm. - 0. 315 mm. size fraction where heavy mineral content (3 %) shows a four-fold increment comparing to its average value in whole placers. Heavy mineral types identified in the placers are in well agree-ment with those of rocks exposed in the immediate vicinity. Chemical and physical nature of detrital gold is very similar to that of gold in quartz veins.

40|$|Producing {{leaves with}} closely spaced veins {{is a key}} {{innovation}} linked to high rates of photosynthesis in angiosperms. A close geometric <b>link</b> between <b>veins</b> and stomata in angiosperms ensures that investment in enhanced venous water transport provides the strongest net carbon return to the plant. This link is underpinned by "passive dilution" via expansion of surrounding cells. However, {{it is not known}} whether this 'passive dilution' mechanism is present in plant lineages other than angiosperms and is another key feature of the angiosperms' evolutionary success. Consequently, we sought to determine whether the 'passive dilution' mechanism is; (i) exclusive to the angiosperms, (ii) a conserved mechanism that evolved in the common ancestor of ferns and angiosperms, or (iii) has evolved continuously over time. To do this we first we assessed the plasticity of vein and stomatal density and epidermal cell size in ferns in response to light environment. We then compared the relationships between these traits found among ferns with modelled relationships that assume vein and stomatal density respond passively to epidermal cell expansion, and with those previously observed in angiosperms. Vein density, stomatal density and epidermal cell size were linked in ferns with remarkably similar relationships to those observed in angiosperms, except that fern leaves had fewer veins per stomata. However, plasticity was limited in ferns and stomatal spacing was dependent on active stomatal differentiation as well as passive cell expansion. Thus, ferns (like angiosperms) appear to coordinate vein and stomatal density with epidermal cell expansion to some extent to maintain a constant ratio between veins and stomata in the leaf. The different general relationships between vein density and stomatal density in ferns and angiosperms suggests the groups have different optimum balances between the production of vein tissue dedicated to water supply and stomatal tissue for gas exchange...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundDecreased venous {{tone and}} vein wall {{dilation}} {{may contribute to}} varicose vein formation. We have shown that prolonged vein wall stretch is associated with upregulation of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) and decreased contraction. Because hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) expression also increases with mechanical stretch, this study tested whether upregulation of HIFs is an intermediary mechanism <b>linking</b> prolonged <b>vein</b> wall stretch to the changes in MMP expression and venous contraction. MethodsSegments of rat inferior vena cava (IVC) were suspended in tissue bath under 0. 5 -g basal tension for 1 hour, and a control contraction to phenylephrine (PHE, 10 – 5 M) and KCl (96 mM) was elicited. The veins were then exposed to prolonged 18 hours of tension at 0. 5 g, 2 g, 2 g plus HIF inhibitor U 0126 (10 – 5 M), 17 -[2 -(dimethylamino) ethyl] amino- 17 -desmethoxygeldanamycin (17 -DMAG, 10 – 5 M), or echinomycin (10 – 6 M), or 2 g plus dimethyloxallyl glycine (DMOG; 10 – 4 M), a prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitor that stabilizes HIF. The fold-change in PHE and KCl contraction was compared with the control contraction at 0. 5 -g tension for 1 hour. Vein tissue homogenates were analyzed for HIF- 1 α, HIF- 2 α, MMP- 2, and MMP- 9 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein amount using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blots. ResultsCompared with control IVC contraction at 0. 5 -g tension for 1 hour, the PHE and KCl contraction after prolonged 0. 5 -g tension was 2. 0 ± 0. 35 and 1. 1 ± 0. 06, respectively. Vein contraction to PHE and KCl after prolonged 2 -g tension was significantly reduced (0. 87 ± 0. 13 and 0. 72 ± 0. 05, respectively). PHE-induced contraction was restored in IVC exposed to prolonged 2 -g tension plus the HIF inhibitor U 0126 (1. 38 ± 0. 15) or echinomycin (1. 99 ± 0. 40). U 0126 and echinomycin also restored KCl-induced contraction in IVC exposed to prolonged 2 -g tension (1. 14 ± 0. 05 and 1. 11 ± 0. 15, respectively). Treatment with DMOG further reduced PHE- and KCl-induced contraction in veins subjected to prolonged 2 -g tension (0. 47 ± 0. 06 and 0. 57 ± 0. 01, respectively). HIF- 1 α and HIF- 2 α mRNA were overexpressed in IVC exposed to prolonged 2 -g tension, and the overexpression was reversed by U 0126. The overexpression of HIF- 1 α and HIF- 2 α in stretched IVC was associated with increased MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 mRNA. The protein amount of HIF- 1 α, HIF- 2 α, MMP- 2, and MMP- 9 was also increased in IVC exposed to prolonged 2 -g wall tension. ConclusionsProlonged increases in vein wall tension are associated with overexpression of HIF- 1 α and HIF- 2 α, increased MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 expression, and reduced venous contraction in rat IVC. Together with our report that MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 inhibit IVC contraction, the data suggest that increased vein wall tension induces HIF overexpression and causes an increase in MMP expression and reduction of venous contraction, leading to progressive venous dilation and varicose vein formation. Clinical RelevanceVaricose veins are a major disease characterized by venous dilation and tortuosity and involve structural changes in the vein wall, including fragmentation of elastin and disorganized venous smooth muscle. Venous hypertension {{is often associated with}} varicose veins and chronic venous insufficiency. Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) are overexpressed in the varicose vein wall and have been shown to promote venous dilation. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) also increase with mechanical stretch. The present study examined whether upregulation of HIFs is an intermediary mechanism linking the increases in vein wall tension to the increases in MMP expression and venous dilation. The results suggest that protracted elevation in venous pressure and vein wall stretch induce HIF overexpression and cause an increase in the expression of MMPs, which in turn produce venous dilation and cause further increases in venous pressure, leading to a recalcitrant cycle and resulting in progressive venous dilation and varicose vein formation. Specific HIF inhibitors and MMP antagonists could be useful tools in disrupting the <b>link</b> between mechanical <b>vein</b> wall stretch and venous dilation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives: Diminished {{production}} of nitric oxide has been <b>linked</b> to saphenous <b>vein</b> endothelial dysfunction. Tetrahydrobiopterin is an obligate cofactor for the oxidation of L -arginine by {{nitric oxide synthase}} in the {{production of}} nitric oxide by endothelial cells. The objective {{of the present study was}} to examine whether the exogenous addition of tetrahydrobiopterin improves endothelial function in saphenous veins from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft operations. Methods: Vascular segments of saphenous veins were obtained from 17 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting, and in vitro endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent responses to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside were assessed. Isometric dose-response curves were constructed in precontracted rings in the presence and absence of tetrahydrobiopterin (0. 1 mmol/L) with the use of the organ bath apparatus. The percentages of maximum relaxation and sensitivity were compared between interventions. Results: Acetylcholine caused dose-dependent endothelium-mediated relaxation in saphenous veins. In the presence of tetrahydrobiopterin, acetylcholine-induced relaxation was significantly augmented (percentage maximum relaxation, 16. 8 % ± 2. 9 % vs control 7. 5 % ± 1. 8 %; P =. 003) without an effect on agonist sensitivity. These effects were endothelium-specific because endothelium-independent responses to sodium nitroprusside were preserved. Conclusions: These data uncover beneficial effects of acute tetrahydrobiopterin addition on endothelial function in human vessels. Because endothelial dysfunction has been implicated in the development of graft failure, studies aimed at chronic delivery of tetrahydrobiopterin would be useful in determining the contribution of this cofactor toward saphenous vein atherosclerosis.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} recognition {{of an important}} contribution of chemokines and their receptors in the pathology of atherosclerosis and related cardiovascular disease. The chemokine receptor CCR 5 was initially known for {{its role as a}} co-receptor for HIV infection of macrophages and is the target of the recently approved CCR 5 antagonist maraviroc. However, evidence is now emerging supporting a role for CCR 5 and its ligands CCL 3 (MIP- 1 α), CCL 4 (MIP- 1 β) and CCL 5 (RANTES) in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Specifically, the CCR 5 deletion polymorphism CCR 5 delta 32, which confers resistance to HIV infection, has been associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and both CCR 5 antagonism and gene deletion reduce atherosclerosis in mouse models of the disease. Antagonism of CCL 5 has also been shown to reduce atherosclerotic burden in these animal models. Crucially, CCR 5 and its ligands CCL 3, CCL 4 and CCL 5 have been identified in human and mouse vasculature and have been detected in human atherosclerotic plaque. Not unexpectedly, CC chemokines have also been <b>linked</b> to saphenous <b>vein</b> graft disease, which shares similarity to native vessel atherosclerosis. Distinct roles for chemokine–receptor systems in atherogenesis have been proposed, with CCR 5 likely to be critical in recruitment of monocytes to developing plaques. With an increased burden of cardiovascular disease observed in HIV-infected individuals, the potential cardiovascular-protective effects of drugs that target the CCR 5 receptor warrant greater attention. The availability of clinically validated antagonists such as maraviroc currently provides an advantage for targeting of CCR 5 over other chemokine receptors...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackground: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} a modification of the composite sequential femorocrural bypass graft that we adopted in 1985, a retrospective case-note study was undertaken. The grafts combined a prosthetic femoropopliteal section with a popliteal to crural section with autologous <b>vein,</b> <b>linked</b> via a common intermediate anastomosis sited on the above-knee popliteal artery. Patients and Methods: Between 1985 and 2000, 68 grafts of this type were constructed in 65 patients with critical ischemia of the lower limb and insufficient autologous vein for construction of an all venous bypass. Reasons for insufficient long saphenous vein included previous lower limb bypass in 33 cases, phlebitis in 16 cases, venous hypoplasia in eight cases, and previous varicose vein surgery in seven cases. Distal anastomoses were carried out to the peroneal artery in 26 cases, the anterior tibial artery in 17 cases, the posterior tibial artery in 17 cases, and the pedal arteries in eight cases. Sources of vein included the long saphenous vein in 26 cases, the arm vein in 38 cases, and the short saphenous vein in two cases. In 22 limbs (32 %), angiography had shown an occluded segment of above-knee popliteal artery, and in these cases, local popliteal disobliteration was performed to receive the composite anastomosis and to provide additional outflow. Results: The 2 -year cumulative primary patency, secondary patency, and limb salvage rates were 68 %, 73 %, and 75 %, respectively. Localized popliteal disobliteration did not compromise graft patency (P =. 07, with log-rank test). Conclusion: In the absence of sufficient autologous vein, patients needing bypass to crural arteries can be offered reconstruction with composite sequential grafting with satisfactory results. Furthermore, an occluded above-knee popliteal segment is not a contraindication for composite sequential bypass reconstruction. (J Vasc Surg 2002; 36 : 772 - 8. ...|$|R
