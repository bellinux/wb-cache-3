Equipped with a glowing letter of endorsement from Emperor Francis II to the Russian Infantry General Mikhail Illarionovich Kutuzov (1745–1813), Schmitt {{arrived at the}} Russian headquarters and was appointed Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Allied Army. Schmitt met with the Russian forces at the great abbey by Melk, on the Danube, and he and the commanders concocted a plan to encircle Édouard Mortier's French force near Dürenstein. To do so, they drew not only on their own military experience, but called upon a captain from the region, to use his geographic and <b>local</b> <b>knowledge.</b>|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{environmental}} {{learning is}} the first step to constructing successful environmental education programs. Little research has addressed the relation between the environmental knowledge learned inside and outside schools. Environmental educators and ethnobiologists have worked independently, without assessing how school and <b>local</b> environmental <b>knowledge</b> relate to each other. This research examines school and <b>local</b> environmental <b>knowledge</b> acquisition of 95 Mexican indigenous adolescents. Multivariate regression analysis was used to assess (1) school and <b>local</b> environmental <b>knowledge</b> overlap and (2) the association between individual environmental knowledge and socio-demographic characteristics. Data show that school and <b>local</b> environmental <b>knowledge</b> are not associated in a statistically significant way. A possible explanation for the finding is that the two forms of knowledge are complementary because they exist in parallel. Adolescents’ school and <b>local</b> environmental <b>knowledge</b> is associated with their level of schooling, but not with parental occupation in community forestry. The use of traditional pedagogical practices at school and the loss of traditional culture at home might hamper indigenous adolescents’ environmental learning. <br /...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{increasing}} loss of <b>local</b> ecological <b>knowledge</b> {{may have}} negative {{impacts on the}} resilience of socio-ecological systems and may also negatively impact bioprospecting efforts, since <b>local</b> ecological <b>knowledge</b> is {{an important source of}} information for searching new drugs. Recent studies try to evaluate whether communities are experiencing loss of <b>local</b> ecological <b>knowledge.</b> However, some of them make conclusions which are erroneously based on specific analyses of a single indicator. We propose an integrative analysis of three indicators, namely: number of plants cited by young people and elders, therapeutic choices and people's connectance in terms of medicinal plant learning. The study was carried out in the community of Sucruiuzinho (Bahia, Brazil). We conducted semistructured interviews and a therapeutic recall with 24 local dwellers. We did not find evidence of <b>local</b> ecological <b>knowledge</b> loss in the studied community. Although younger people know fewer plants, they are well connected in terms of knowledge transmission. Moreover, in illness events, young people and adults have similar proportions of choice for plants when compared to allopathy. Concomitant use of the three indicators leads to a more realistic scenario of <b>local</b> ecological <b>knowledge</b> loss than the use of only one of them...|$|R

Being adept at exploiting their environment, they have <b>local</b> <b>knowledge</b> of their mountains and are {{left to their own}} devices, being gathered once or twice a year. Originally often horned, and various shades of brown or black, they were often of poor conformation and bedraggled appearance. More recently, scientific breeding has improved them and they have been exported to many parts of the world. They form part of the ancestry of various local breeds of sheep in Wales, the Llanwenog, the Lleyn sheep, the Kerry Hill, the badger-faced, the Welsh mule and the Beulah speckle-faced. In rural areas, sheep are still an important part of life with local livestock shows and sheep dog trials taking place annually.|$|E
5|$|At 22:00 on 12 November Amazone and Elisa sailed from Le Havre {{to unite}} {{with the force}} at Cherbourg, hoping to evade the {{blockade}} in the darkness. They successfully passed the patrolling Diana and Niobe but were spotted sailing northwest at 00:30 by the British ships which gave chase, Niobe turning inshore {{in an attempt to}} cut off the French line of advance. With the wind in the northeast, the French frigates were unable to pass Cape Barfleur under pursuit, and Rosseau instead turned his squadron towards the Iles Saint-Marcouf at 04:00, using superior <b>local</b> <b>knowledge</b> to bypass the pursuing British ships. The heavily fortified islands had been under British control during the French Revolutionary Wars, but reverted to the French at the Peace of Amiens in 1802. Diana and Niobe attempted to intercept the French frigates before they came under the shelter of the guns, but were only able to fire two long-distance broadsides at the trailing Elisa.|$|E

The 12thCavalry was ordered to follow the 2ndSquadron, 7thCavalry in its advance to the north, and to capture the Salami Plantation.

40|$|It is well {{recognised}} that <b>local</b> ecological <b>knowledge</b> is {{an important}} facet of natural resource management in rural regions of the developing world. However, techniques to assess levels and to integrate it into formal or informal management approaches require further development. In particular, quantitative tools are missing, which would allow more robust analysis {{of the factors that}} positively or negatively affect <b>local</b> ecological <b>knowledge</b> and vice versa. This paper reports on a quick assessment approach that provides a quantitative score of generalist <b>local</b> ecological <b>knowledge</b> at the household level. It does so by comparing responses to the <b>knowledge</b> of <b>local</b> people identified as experts within the community. In this way it is both locally constructed and contextualized, and thereby avoids pitfalls of trying to score <b>local</b> ecological <b>knowledge</b> relative to conventional scientific knowledge which frequently cannot account for local constructs.

5|$|He {{later became}} a steam enthusiast, befriending many of the engine drivers and firemen {{who worked on the}} nearby railway. As a {{teenager}} he met a driver who invited him onto the footplate of his locomotive and who asked him to keep the boiler supplied with fuel. Dibnah became so enamoured with steam engines that he eventually looked for one he could buy. He learnt of a steamroller kept in a barn near Warrington and which the owners had bought from Flintshire County Council. He had the boiler pressure-tested and, despite its being in poor condition, bought it for £175. He towed it to a friend's house, spent a fortnight making various repairs, and drove it to his mother's house in Bolton. After he married and bought his own property on Radcliffe New Road, he cut an access road to the garden of his new house and moved the steamroller there. Restoring the engine took many years, as Dibnah had to create his own replacement parts, using Victorian engineering techniques and equipment he built in his garden. The boiler was in poor condition and needed serious work, but Dibnah fell back on <b>local</b> <b>knowledge</b> and was eventually able to build a new boiler. Once it was restored, he used the 1910 Aveling and Porter steamroller together with a living van he bought and restored, to take his family around the local steam fairs. While driving the vehicle was relatively safe, Dibnah had experienced several mishaps, including one instance when he lost control while descending a steep hill and was forced to drive the engine into a concrete barrier to bring it to a halt, smashing the front fork in the process.|$|E

25|$|The {{establishment}} of relayed VHF stations proved {{the reliability of}} unmanned stations, and the Telecommunications Administration started a process to unman the least trafficked coast radio stations. Proposals of remote controlling stations often resulted in a heated local debate, in part caused by the press claiming that the stations would be closed instead of simply moving the employees. One {{of the advantages of}} remote controlling was that instead of having one person on duty, there would be two, of which one person would be a dedicated emergency transmission listener and one would handle other correspondence. In smaller stations there was only one employee for both tasks. An often-used argument against unmanning was that the operators had <b>local</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Operators were often {{from other parts of the}} country and typically did not have sufficient <b>local</b> <b>knowledge</b> for their section of the coastline for it to make a difference.
