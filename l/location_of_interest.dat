2500|$|By the 1970s, the Triboro Hospital transitioned into {{a normal}} {{hospital}} within the Queens Hospital complex. At this time, Queens Hospital Center was considered antiquated, with over 90 {{percent of the}} hospital beds below state health standards, along with overcrowding of hospital wards and shortages of equipment. The large and open hospital wards with dozens of beds that Queens General and Triboro Hospital were built with were now in violation of modern health codes. In addition, private hospitals often sent unwanted patients to Queens Hospital, which as a municipal hospital could not refuse them. The medical center {{was referred to as}} a [...] "snake pit" [...] by city councilman Matthew J. Troy, Jr., in reference to its condition and code violations. Because of this, the city began looking for a site further south, in Jamaica or South Jamaica, to construct a replacement for Queens Hospital Center. The primary <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> was a site on Liberty Avenue adjacent {{to the west of the}} future York College campus between Jamaica and South Jamaica, just south of the Long Island Rail Road Main Line and abutting its Atlantic Branch. Relocation to this area would bring the hospital closer to the majority of its patient population. A new hospital at this site would be served by extensions of New York City Subway lines along Archer Avenue, then being built, and planned further extensions into Southeast Queens. This hospital along with York College and the subway lines would be built as part of the renewal of the downtown Jamaica area during that time, which would create Jamaica Center. Other plans included building on an alternate South Jamaica site, and rebuilding the hospital on its current property. The city also evaluated creating a medical school for the new hospital, to be affiliated with York College, Queens College, or the Stony Brook University School of Medicine then under construction.|$|E

50|$|This {{was also}} tested with natural lncRNA domains by {{building}} Pol II-driven TOP1 and INT constructs fused with human lncRNA domains. lncRNAs used had lengths between ~90-4800 nt, and included the NoRC-binding pRNA, three enhancer-transcribed RNAs (eRNAs) FALEC, TRERNA1 and ncRNA-a3), Xist A-repeat (RepA),and the 4,799-nt transcriptional activator HOTTIP. While all the constructs showed significant direct activation, it decreased with increasing lncRNA-sgRNA length. These lncRNA domains could regulate the reporters independent of dCas9 with pRNA and RepA repressing the GLuc reporter expression (repressors) and TRERNA1, ncRNA-a3 and HOTTIP inducing activation (activators), but were properly targeted to an ectopic <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> {{by using the}} CRISP-Disp system.|$|E

50|$|There {{are a few}} key {{locations}} on the M-y diagram which are labeled in Figure 6 above developed {{based on the information}} in Example 1. The first <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> is the critical point labeled with yc and Mc in Figure 6. The critical point represents the minimum value of the momentum function available for that particular flow per unit width, q. An increase in q would cause the M function to move to the right and slightly up, giving the flow access to more momentum at its critical point. It follows that a decrease in the q value would move the M function down and to the left, decreasing the momentum available to the flow at its critical value. This is shown graphically Figure 7 below.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} (UAV) ice tracking framework for use in sea ice management applications. The framework {{is intended to be}} used in an ice management scenario where the UAV should detect and track the movement of icebergs and ice floes in an Arctic environment, and seeks to enable the UAV to do so autonomously. This is achieved by using an occupancy grid map algorithm and a <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> generator coupled with a Model Predictive Control (MPC) UAV path planner. The main contribution of this paper is interfacing the occupancy grid map algorithm with a machine vision object detection module in order to enable the UAV to generate an occupancy grid map of a pre-defined search area in real-time using on-board processing of UAV sensor data. Further, the paper presents a <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> generator module which generates locations that the UAV should investigate based on the generated occupancy grid map. These <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> are then used by an MPC path planner {{in order to make the}} UAV autonomously investigate and track ice features at said locations. Furthermore, the paper verifies the use of the developed ice tracking framework for autonomously detecting and tracking ice features based on thermal images captured with a UAV, as well as verifying the usefulness and role of UAVs in ice management scenarios by conducting two flight experiments...|$|R
