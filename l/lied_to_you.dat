6000|$|... 'Men have <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about Him, mother: but has He ever <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about Himself? He did not {{lie to me}} when He sent me {{out into}} the world to find a man, and sent me back again to you with the good news that The Man is born into the world.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "People {{talked to}} you in Paris about us," [...] she continued, [...] "about Anna the virtuous and Annabel the rake. You were accused of having been seen with the latter. You denied it, remembering that I had called myself Anna. You went even to our rooms and saw my sister. Anna <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> I <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> I was Annabel the rake, 'Alcide' of the music halls. My name is Annabel, not Anna. Do you understand?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not one {{has ever}} heard it. It was not <b>to</b> them I <b>lied,</b> but <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and <b>to</b> Grey. D---- the creditors! What do I care for them, though they be all ruined?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{sounds very}} picturesque," [...] Maggie said coldly, [...] "but I {{do not follow}} your allegory. What I {{want to know is}} why <b>you</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> me, why <b>you</b> sent me <b>to</b> that house to meet Prince Shan?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{have broken}} your faith; <b>you</b> have <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> me; <b>you</b> have {{forgotten}} your wrongs and mine; {{but you have}} not yet forgotten my parting words when I left you last night! I told you {{that she should be}} slain, and now that <b>you</b> have refused <b>to</b> avenge me, I will make good my words by killing her with my own hand! If you would defend her, you must murder me. You must shed her blood or mine!' ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Oh, it's infamous!' {{she cried}} suddenly. 'She's <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> she's been odiously deceitful. She must be vile and heartless. She must be rotten {{to the very}} soul.' ...|$|E

50|$|His {{earliest}} {{work was}} with the band Wig, and it is his voice that you hear on the <b>Lying</b> Next <b>to</b> <b>You</b> record. Sometime in the early 1990s, Long began a side project with the Laughing Hyenas' rhythm section, Kevin Munro and Jim Kimball. They put together a concoction of field hollers, backwoods legends, hellbilly canon and mixed it with a semi-punk, semi-metallic musical assault that was best described as northern redneck, but intelligent, clamor.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't believe you!" [...] cried Lapham brutally, but a wild predatory hope {{made his}} heart leap {{so that it}} seemed to turn over in his breast. [...] "I don't believe there are any such parties to begin with; and in the next place, I don't believe they would buy at any such figure; unless--unless you've <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> them, as you've <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> me.

6000|$|... "Lassiter, I <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> But I beg of you--don't you lie to me. I've {{great respect}} for you. I believe you're {{softened}} toward most, perhaps all, my people except--But when I speak of your purpose, your hate, your guns, I have only him in mind. I don't believe you've changed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is my wife,' he cried, {{springing}} {{to where}} she sat with the sleeping child in her lap. 'They have <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> me, and <b>you</b> are not dead after all, nor the boy either! But what has happened? Why did they lie to me? {{and why did you}} leave my house where you were safe?' And he turned and looked fiercely at his father.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] {{he said in}} a low voice, and {{a manner}} quite free from any {{personal}} annoyance,--"perhaps it's just as well that <b>you</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> her as <b>you</b> did. You can say now that the pick-pocket was arrested the other day, and you got your money back." [...] Mr. Oakhurst quietly slipped four twenty-dollar gold-pieces into the broad hand of the bewildered Mr. Decker. [...] "Say that--or any thing you like--but the truth. Promise me you won't say that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] went on his father, {{standing}} before him, his tall frame swaying backwards and forwards with excitement; [...] "no, do not curse her, she, like your other poor dupe, is an honest woman; on yourself be the damnation, you living fraud, you outcast from all honour, who have brought shame and reproach upon our honest name, on you be it; may every curse attend you, and may remorse torture <b>you.</b> Listen: <b>you</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> me, <b>you</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> your wife, trebly did <b>you</b> lie <b>to</b> the unfortunate girl you have deceived; but, {{if you will}} not speak it, for once hear the truth, and remember that <b>you</b> have <b>to</b> deal with one so relentless, that fools, mistaking justice for oppression, call him 'devil.' I, 'Devil Caresfoot,' tell you that I will disinherit you of every stick, stone, and stiver that the law allows me, and start you in the enjoyment of the rest with my bitterest curse. This I will do now whilst I am alive; when I am dead, by Heaven, I will haunt you if I can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Judge," [...] he said slowly, with {{an attempt}} to control his voice, [...] "wouldn't it have been fairer to wait awhile, before you made a remark like that?

6000|$|MURRAY (desperately {{striving to}} {{convince}} her). Yes. I saw Stanton. I <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> before--about that.

5000|$|In 1998 Neuborne won a $1.25 billion {{settlement}} for Jewish Holocaust {{survivors in}} a lawsuit against Swiss banks who helped the Nazis steal money from Jewish victims. [...] After undertaking the initial litigation pro bono, Neuborne gave notice {{that he intended to}} be paid for his work on the settlement. He applied for $4.1 million in fees for [...] "8,000 hours over the past seven years" [...] of work he did in the settlement against the banks. Some Holocaust survivor organizations in the United States filed an objection to Neuborne's claim. The editorial board of the New York Times admonished Neuborne, stating, [...] "The dollar amounts are troubling and so are the slipshod hourly records that Mr. Neuborne submitted," [...] and criticizing his $700 hourly rate as [...] "unseemly" [...] and more suited to corporate clients. [...] The Times also criticized the survivors for expecting [...] "arduous, complicated legal work without pay." [...] When asked about the controversy, Neuborne said, [...] "At the end of my career, to have to listen to people say, 'You <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> us, <b>you</b> cheated, <b>you</b> did this <b>to</b> us!'...it hurts, especially since they are survivors." ...|$|R
5000|$|As a teenager, Dessen {{was very}} shy and quiet. She became {{involved}} with a 21-year-old when she was 15 but cut all contact with him shortly after. She has admitted {{in an interview that}} [...] "for many years afterward, I took total blame for everything that happened between me and T. After all, I was a bad kid. I'd did drugs, I <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> my mom. <b>You</b> can't just hang out with a guy and not expect him to get ideas, I told myself. You should have known better. But maybe he should have. When I turned 21, I remember making a point, regularly, to look at teens and ask myself whether I'd want to hang out with them, much less date one. The answer was always a flat, immediate no. They were kids. I was an adult. End of story." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You've <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> me," [...] he said, {{turning and}} {{speaking}} with the bluntness of a boy without subtlety of speech. [...] "I never'll speak <b>to</b> <b>you</b> again; good-by." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot stay. You will acknowledge, Violet, that I {{have never}} <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> I am {{thinking}} of you day and night. The more indifferent you show yourself to me, the more I love you. Violet, try to love me." [...] He came up to her, and took her by both her hands, and tears were in his eyes. [...] "Say you will try to love me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you are wise, you'll {{keep your}} distance. Hardy Baker {{brought you here}} to insult honest people who would scorn to have {{dealings}} with informers, {{even though they do}} chance to be of the same family. He <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and you should let him attend to his own affairs. It is an even-handed battle, and both shall have fair play so far as I am concerned." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Since you laid me {{low in the}} hut of {{the good}} priest, I have served you well, Norman of Torn. You should know my loyalty by this time and that never have I <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> No man of yours has done this thing, nor is {{it the first time}} that vile scoundrels have placed your mark upon their dead that they might thus escape suspicion, themselves." ...|$|E

40|$|It is {{no doubt}} wrong to conflate promise {{breaking}} and lying. What parent has not heard a child say with no small degree of indignation, 2 Ì† 2 <b>You</b> <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> me; <b>you</b> promised you would.... 2 Ì† 2 Accusations of this kind can be evidence of conceptual confusion: You might be a scoundrel for breaking your promise, {{but you are not}} thereby a liarâ€”someone who knowingly misrepresents an existing fact. The act of promising to do, or to refrain from doing, something in the future does not, by itself, give the promisor even the opportunity to lie. But the action for promissory fraud suggests that our impulse to call certain promise-breakers 2 Ì† 2 liars 2 Ì† 2 is often correct. Promising is a single act with multiple meanings. According to the literal meaning, the speaker of the words 2 Ì† 2 I promise to... 2 Ì† 2 puts herself under a certain obligationâ€”an obligation to do the act promised. In many contexts, however, a promise to do something also represents an intent to do it. And as Lord Bowen stated in an early promissory fraud case, 2 Ì† 2 the state of a man 2 Ì† 7 s mind is as much a fact as the state of his digestion. 2 Ì† 2 By saying something about the promisor 2 Ì† 7 s present intent, the act of promising creates the opportunity to lie...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Horncastle {{went on with}} dogged bitterness, [...] "Yes, my husband. I went to him to beg and bribe him to let me see my child. Yes, MY child," [...] {{she said}} frantically, {{tightening}} her hold upon his hand, [...] "for I <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> when I once told you I had none. I had a child, and, more than that, a child who at his birth I did not dare to openly claim." ...|$|E
6000|$|She withdrew {{her hand}} and passed it over her eyes. After a moment she caught his hand again, and, holding it tightly as if she feared he might fly from her, bit her lip, and then slowly, without looking at him, said, [...] "I <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about myself and Kitty that night; I did not come with her. I came alone and {{secretly}} to Boomville to see--to see {{the man who is}} my husband." ...|$|E
6000|$|Forgive me, my brother. I knew not--I {{know not}} now--what I say. Yes, I <b>lied</b> <b>to</b> <b>you!</b> I will put dust on my head--and I am an Afridi!
