60|$|The place Margery {{had chosen}} {{was a nice}} little nook for a nice <b>little</b> <b>hermit.</b> It {{was a bit of}} low beach, very narrow, and flanked on the shore side by a row of bushes, which soon turned and grew down to the water's edge, thus {{completely}} cutting off one end of the beach. At the other end the distance between the shrubbery and the water was but a few feet, so that Margery could eat her breakfast without being disturbed {{by the rest of the}} world.|$|E

She has got the nicest garden in the world, and a greenhouse, and a great squirt-syringe, I mean, to water it; and we always used to get it, till once, without meaning it, I {{squirted}} right through the drawing-room window, and made such a puddle; and Mrs. Brown thought it was Charlie, only I ran in and told of myself, and Mrs. Brown said it was very generous, {{and gave me a}} Venetian weight with a <b>little</b> <b>hermit</b> in a snow-storm; only it is worn out now, and won't snow, so I gave it to little Lily when we had the whooping-cough." ...|$|E
50|$|The Tapajós hermit {{was first}} {{described}} in 1950 as a subspecies of the <b>little</b> <b>hermit.</b> At that time many small hermits now treated as separate species were considered subspecies of the <b>little</b> <b>hermit,</b> and the Tapajós hermit {{was believed to}} be most closely related to the black-throated hermit. In 1996 it was suggested that the Tapajós hermit was entirely invalid, and actually represented hybrids between the reddish and streak-throated hermits. In 2009 this hypothesis was shown to be incorrect, and the Tapajós hermit was instated as a valid species.|$|E

5000|$|Bresdin's 'Comedy of Death' was one, {{where an}} {{impossible}} landscape bristling with trees, coppices and thickets taking {{the shape of}} demons and phantoms, swarming with birds having rat's heads and tails of vegetables, from a soil littered with human bones, vertebrae, ribs and skulls, spring willows, knotted and gnarled, surmounted by skeletons tossing their arms in unison and chanting a hymn of victory, while a Christ flies away to a sky dappled with <b>little</b> clouds; a <b>hermit</b> sits pondering, his head between his hands, in the recesses of a grotto; a beggar dies, worn out with privations, exhausted with hunger, stretched on his back, his feet extended towards a stagnant pool." ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>little</b> <b>hermit</b> lays two {{eggs in a}} conical nest {{suspended}} under a large leaf. Incubation and fledging period not reported, {{but probably}} as relatives where incubations is 14-16 days, and fledging another 20-23 days.|$|E
50|$|Previously, {{several other}} small hermits were {{considered}} subspecies of this species. This includes the stripe-throated hermit (P. striigularis) of Central America and north-western South America, the minute hermit (P. idaliae) of south-eastern Brazil, the Tapajós hermit (P. aethopyga) of south-eastern Amazonia, and the black-throated hermit (P. atrimentalis) of western Amazonia. As presently defined, the <b>little</b> <b>hermit</b> is monotypic.|$|E
50|$|The <b>little</b> <b>hermit</b> (Phaethornis longuemareus) is a hummingbird {{that is a}} {{resident}} breeder in north-eastern Venezuela, northern Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana and Trinidad. This lowland species occurs in various semi-open wooded habitats, e.g. mangrove, secondary forest, plantations and scrub. In Trinidad it also occurs in rainforest. It is fairly common in most of its range, and therefore listed as Least Concern by BirdLife International.|$|E
50|$|The film {{takes many}} of its {{elements}} and main characters from the Third Crusade, which was prompted by the Saracen capture of Jerusalem and the crusader states in the Holy Land in A.D. 1187. The character of King Richard the Lionheart is established early {{as a man of}} action but <b>little</b> thought. A <b>hermit</b> arrives preaching a great Crusade to bring Jerusalem back into Christian hands. Richard enlists in order, cynically, to get out of an arranged betrothal to Princess Alice of France. A plot is laid against Richard's life by his brother Prince John and Conrad, Marquis of Montferrat. En route to the war, Richard meets Berengaria, Princess of Navarre and—again cynically—marries her in exchange for food for his men. Berengaria accompanies Richard to the Holy Land.|$|R
50|$|The stripe-throated hermit has, {{together}} {{with several other}} small hermits, often been considered a subspecies of the <b>little</b> <b>hermit</b> (P. longuemareus), but morphological data suggest it may {{be closer to the}} grey-chinned hermit (P. griseolaris). At present most, if not all, major authorities accept the split (SACC, the Clements check list, the Howard & Moore check list, etc.). It has been suggested that the mainly Central American taxon saturatus, which typically is considered a subspecies of P. striigularis, may deserve species status, in which case it would become the dusky hermit or Boucard's hermit (P. saturatus). The taxon adolphi is considered a junior synonym of saturatus by most authorities.|$|E
40|$|Hummingbirds, {{such as the}} <b>Little</b> <b>Hermit</b> (Phaethornis longuemareus) and the Green-Crowned Brilliant (Heliodoxa jacula) {{apparently}} are attracted to the hidden flowers of Columnea florida Morton (Gesneriaceae) by two conspicuous red spots located on the upper surface near {{the apex of the}} large leaves. This extrafloral attraction mechanism, in which the attracting unit, or leaf, does not simply simulate a portion of the flower, seems to be a new and unique type of hummingbird pollination system...|$|E
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I {{examine the}} functional significance of microgeographic dialects in a lek-mating hummingbird, in four parts. First, I develop a novel song analysis tool, based upon techniques first developed for human speech recognition, to enable rapid, quantitative, unbiased, and repeatable measurement and description of vocal dialects. Then, using this tool, I analyze {{the songs of}} lekking little hermits (Phaethornis longuemareus) to quantify dialectal variation in this species. Second, I examine the potential role of male-male competition in structuring the dialects described in the previous chapter. Specifically, I use an experimental playback procedure to test predictions of the hypothesis that males recruiting to leks may use vocal mimicry to deceive territory holders about their residency status (i. e. the deceptive mimicry hypothesis). Males responding to playbacks 1) showed reduced aggression to neighbors' songs than to strangers (i. e. they showed a "dear enemy" response), 2) {{did not appear to}} recognize individuals based on their songs, and 3) responded less quickly, but not less aggressively to unfamiliar "mimic" songs. Together, these results support the deceptive mimicry hypothesis, and provide evidence that dialects on <b>little</b> <b>hermit</b> leks may form through the widespread use of song mimicry. Third, I test three hypotheses explaining the role of female-choice in the formation of song dialects on hermit leks: females use dialects 1) to facilitate comparisons between males, 2) to assess dialect-level phenotypes, and 3) to reveal male dominance patterns. I also test a fourth hypothesis that females use song to re-locate preferred males (i. e. "hotshots") and lower quality males deceptively mimic the song of these preferred males to deceive mate faithful females into mating with the mimic. I found no support for the first three female choice hypotheses, but tentative support for the fourth. Females mated with different males within the same dialect at a rate greater than expected by chance, suggesting the possibility that females use song to re-locate males, and song sharing allows mimics the opportunity to intercept these females. Fourth, I describe a novel marking technique essential for the study of individual behavior in little hermits and other small hummingbirds. 2021 - 02 - 0...|$|E
