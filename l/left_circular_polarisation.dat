40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the optical spectroscopic measurements of III-V semiconductors used {{to investigate a}} number of issues related to the development of integrated quantum optical circuits. The disorder-limited propagation of photons in photonic crystal waveguides in the slow-light regime is investigated. The analysis of Fabry-Perot resonances is used to map the mode dispersion and extract the photon localisation length. Andersonlocalised modes are observed at high group indices, when the localisation lengths are shorter than the waveguide lengths, consistent with the Fabry-Perot analysis. A spin-photon interface based on two orthogonal waveguides is introduced, where the polarisation emitted by a quantum dot is mapped to a path-encoded photon. Operation is demonstrated by deducing the spin using the interference of in-plane photons. A second device directly maps right and <b>left</b> <b>circular</b> <b>polarisations</b> to anti-parallel waveguides, surprising for a non-chiral structure but consistent with an off-centre dot. Two dimensional photonic crystal cavities in GaInP and full control over the spontaneous emission rate of InP quantum dots is demonstrated by spectrally tuning the exciton emission energy into resonance with the fundamental cavity mode. Fourier transform spectroscopy is used to investigate the short coherence times of InP quantum dots in GaInP photonic crystal cavities. Additional technological developments are also presented including a quantum dot registration technique, electrical tuning of quantum dot emission and uniaxial strain tuning of H 1 cavity modes...|$|R

I further compare detections and limits of <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> and circular-to-linear polarisation ratios in other X-ray binaries.

40|$|<b>Circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> is {{commonly}} induced through the multiple scattering of light by aerosols in a planetary atmosphere and the multiple reflection of light by a rough surface. More interestingly, light reflected by organisms displays unique spectral <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> behaviour, presenting {{the possibility of}} circular polarimetry {{for the detection of}} life. It has previously been neglected due its relatively small signal and the need for advanced instrumentation in its measurement. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> that can be induced by the atmosphere of an exoplanet and the impact it would have on the measurement of surface features. This was done through the modelling of the multiple scattering of light by aerosols for varying aerosol and atmospheric conditions. The influence of partial cloud cover was also modelled. A degree of <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> between 10 - 3 or 10 - 5 was typically observed. The maximum values were found at phase angles of 30 ° to 70 °, with an additional peak at 110 ° to 140 ° and near-zero values around 90 °. The particle size, real refractive index and cloud and gas optical thickness values were the most significant parameters. The introduction of partial cloud cover increased the variability of <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> values and high cloud symmetry with respect to the equator led to a decrease in the <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation.</b> The modelled <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> may be measurable for some cases but not all. The best phase angles for observation are around 40 ° and 140 °, where the <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> is near peak value and the linear polarisation is relatively small. The symmetry of the clouds is advantageous for the observation of surface features, as <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> values cancel out due to having opposite sign. However, a fully cloudy planet would make surface observations very challenging. This work can be built upon with the modelling of surface and biological <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation.</b> Most importantly, observations of organism-dense areas are required to determine the potential of circular polarimetry for the detection of life.

40|$|Noctilucent {{clouds are}} very tenuous clouds {{that appear in}} the high {{latitude}} mesosphere during the summer 1. They are seen by scattering of sunlight from cloud particles near the mesopause. They {{are known to be}} at altitudes of ~ 82 km, more than 50 km higher than the next highest clouds in the atmosphere, the nacreous or mother-of-pearl clouds. They are usually seen after midnight in June and July in the north-east twilight arch at latitudes of 55 – 65 ° and appear silvery-blue 2 in the red twilight glow. Observations have been made from ground level 3, 4, rocket 5 and satellites 6, 7. Studies of sunlight scattered from the clouds have concentrated on measurements of polarisation of the scattered light to allow estimates of the size distribution of the cloud particles to be made. These estimates agree in that only submicron particles with an upper radius limit in the range 0. 05 – 0. 3 µm are present. Recent measurements 4 of scattered light have shown the presence of a small proportion of <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation,</b> indicating that the cloud particles are probably non-spherical, and estimates of the particle size, being {{based on the assumption that}} scattering is from homogeneous spheres (Mie scattering), may need revision. The revision might be enough to force reappraisal of the amount of water condensed to form the clouds and consequent reappraisal of the relative humidity in this part of the atmosphere. A small amount of <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> can be produced in the scattering of natural (unpolarised) light from elongated particles 8 but a greater proportion of <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> will arise if the incident light is partly polarised and if the axes of the elongated particles show some directional preference. However, light scattered from spherical particles will also show some small amount of <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation,</b> if the incident light were to be linearly polarised in a direction skewed with respect to the plane of scattering. If the <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> is produced by elongated cloud particles, it is possible that polarisation of the scattered light will show marked differences from place to place due to different proportions and directions of alignment of particles being caused by updraughts or vertical wind shears present in different parts of the cloud region. This would not be expected if the <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> was due to scattering of linearly polarised light from spherical particles.

Following a radio flare in 2001 January, significant and variable <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation,</b> at a fractional level of 0. 2 - 0. 4 %, was measured with ATCA at four frequencies between 1 - 9 GHz. Following an additional outburst 65 days later in 2001 March, further ATCA observations measured a comparable sign and level of <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> at two frequencies. At this second epoch, contemporaneous MERLIN observations directly imaged a relativistic ejection event and allowed us to confidently associate both the circularly and linearly polarised emission with the relativistic ejecta, allowing a detailed measurement of the full polarisation properties in the optically thin phase. The fractional <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> spectrum appears to flatten at higher frequencies in 2001 January, when there is strong evidence for multiple components at different optical depths.
