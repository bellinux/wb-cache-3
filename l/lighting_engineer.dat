500|$|After Echo & the Bunnymen had {{finished}} recording Porcupine {{they played a}} free show in early November 1982 for [...] people at Sefton Park in Liverpool. Following this, WEA asked for three music videos and album art for the new album. The band's <b>lighting</b> <b>engineer</b> Bill Butt was chosen to direct the videos and Brian Griffin was chosen to take the photographs for the album's cover– {{as he had done}} for the band's two previous albums. With a budget of £ Butt decided that {{it would be possible to}} get the photographs for the album cover and also to produce a half-hour film. Deciding that he wanted the videos to reflect the frigid feel of the music on the album, Butt chose to shoot the videos in Scotland. However, it was not certain that there would be enough snow in Scotland during November so Iceland was chosen as the location to shoot the videos.|$|E
500|$|Bush's {{first tour}} took place 2 April – 13 May 1979; 35 {{years later she}} {{embarked}} {{on a series of}} 22 concerts at the Hammersmith Apollo, London, beginning 26 August 2014. Apart from these two concert series, she has given only occasional live performances. Several reasons have been suggested as to why she abandoned touring, among them her reputed need to be in total control of the final product, which is incompatible with live stage performance; a rumour of a crippling fear of flying; and the suggestion that the death of 21-year-old Bill Duffield severely affected her. Duffield, her <b>lighting</b> <b>engineer,</b> was killed in an accident during her concert of 2 April 1979 at Poole Arts Centre. Bush held a benefit concert on 12 May 1979, with Peter Gabriel and Steve Harley at London's Hammersmith Odeon for his family. Duffield would be honoured in two later songs: [...] "Blow Away" [...] on Never for Ever and [...] "Moments of Pleasure" [...] on The Red Shoes. Bush explained in a BBC Radio 2 interview with Mark Radcliffe that she actually enjoyed the tour but was consumed with producing her subsequent records. A BBC film crew followed the preparation for the tour which was shown as a 30-minute special on the Nationwide programme.|$|E
500|$|The tour {{played at}} large-capacity venues, and in Europe the tour alternated between indoor and outdoor, open-field venues. Michael Clark, a <b>lighting</b> <b>engineer</b> for the tour, {{died at the}} Stadio Comunale in Florence, Italy on 9 June after falling from the {{scaffolding}} before the show commenced. The following day on 10 June, another worker fell (without lethal injury) while helping build the set in Milan. Mobs of fans, some who had camped out overnight {{to get into the}} venue, rioted and had to be controlled by police. Both shows in Rome (on 15 and 16 June) saw similar rioting as fans who could not get tickets to the shows clashed with police. On the second night, Bowie had to sing through tear gas as 50 people were arrested and 15 policemen were injured in the rioting. As the band's plane was leaving Rome after their show on 16 June, a bomb scare forced the plane to return to the airport, only to discover that the local chief of police had used it as a ruse to get Bowie's autograph. Said Bowie of the incident, [...] "I was not so much annoyed as stunned – that could only happen in Italy!" [...] The 27 June concert, originally scheduled to be performed at Ullevi, Gothenburg, Sweden had to be moved to nearby Eriksberg in Hisingen because a previous concert by Bruce Springsteen held at Ullevi Stadium incurred £2.7m (or about £m today) in damages. A fan trying to enter the Slane Castle backstage area by swimming the River Boyne drowned just before the show on 11 July.|$|E

2500|$|As part of {{the ongoing}} post-IRA bomb {{regeneration}} of the city centre, the city council had set up an international competition for the redesign of Piccadilly Gardens. The winners – announced in 1998 from a short-list that had been whittled down to six – were the landscape architects EDAW and its partners, consisting of: the engineers Arup; renowned Japanese architect Tadao Ando; local architects Chapman Robinson; and <b>lighting</b> <b>engineer,</b> Peter Fink. [...] The square was finally revamped in 2001–02, to include new green space and fountains (by EDAW), and a pavilion (by Tadao Ando) which partially functions to shield the gardens from the transport interchange. [...] At the same time One Piccadilly Gardens was constructed on {{the eastern edge of}} the square. The resulting space was radically different from the old gardens, and the only links to the past that remained were the original statues. The redesign was {{part of the}} massive construction process that covered Manchester in the buildup to the city hosting the 2002 Commonwealth Games. Previously the square was becoming increasingly run down and was considered unsafe. [...] At a contract cost of around £10 million Piccadilly Gardens was renovated and ended up being shortlisted in 2003 for the Better Public Building Award. Part of the area was built on to help fund the redevelopment.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the band}} settled into Morgan Studios, Lane and Anderson {{proceeded}} {{to decorate the}} studio like a farmyard. Squire believed Lane did so as a joke on Anderson as he wished to record in the country. Anderson brought in flowers, pots of greenery, and cut out cows and sheep to make the studio resemble a garden as a typical studio did not [...] "push the envelope about what you're trying to create musically". Wakeman recalled the addition of white picket fences and his keyboards and amplifiers placed on stacks of hay. At the time of recording, heavy metal group Black Sabbath were recording Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (1973) in the adjacent studio. Singer Ozzy Osbourne recalled the Yes studio also had a model cow with electronic udders fitted and a small barn to give the room an [...] "earthy" [...] feel. [...] "About halfway through the album", said Offord, [...] "The cows were covered in graffiti and all the plants had died. That just kind of sums up that whole album". At one point during the recording stage, Anderson wished for a [...] "bathroom sound" [...] effect on his vocals and asked the band's <b>lighting</b> <b>engineer,</b> Michael Tait, to build him a plywood box with tiles stuck onto it. After Tait explained to Anderson that the idea would not work, Tait [...] "built it anyway". Sound engineer Nigel Luby recalled that tiles would fall off the box during recording takes.|$|E
