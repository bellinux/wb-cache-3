50|$|Street fights that ensued {{after the}} storm of the party’s office lasted until 21:00.

50|$|The {{issue is}} that DIFC {{domiciled}} REITs cannot acquire non-Freezone assets within the Emirate of Dubai. The only federally approved Freezone within the UAE is the DIFC itself so therefore any properties outside this zone are purchasable by <b>local</b> Gulf (GCC) <b>passport</b> holders only. However, through a collaboration with local authorities, Emirates REIT {{has been able to}} establish a platform enabling it to purchase properties anywhere in Dubai given a minimum of 51% of local ownership of its shares. This allows the company to diversify its portfolio with an efficient revenue generating mix of properties in the prime locations of Dubai. Emirates REIT is the first REIT established within the United Arab Emirates. It is also the first REIT listed on NASDAQ Dubai and one of the five Shari'a compliant REIT in the world with a focus on Income-producing assets.|$|R
