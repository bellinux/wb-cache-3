40|$|Effects of {{freezing}} and frozen storage on pH, titratable acidity and non-volatile organic acids of two pineapple fruit cultivars, Smooth Cayenne and Red Spanish, were studied. Pineapple fruit was frozen as slices {{in a cold}} room at - 18 °C and stored at this temperature for a 12 month period. A negative correlation was found between pH and titratable acidity in the two cultivars throughout frozen storage (r = - 0. 67 for Smooth Cayenne and r = - 0. 71 for Red Spanish).

2500|$|All {{lactic acid}} {{bacteria}} (LAB) involved in winemaking, whether as a positive contributor or {{as a source for}} potential faults, have the ability to produce lactic acid through the metabolism of a sugar source, as well as the metabolism of <b>L-malic</b> <b>acid.</b> Species differ in how they metabolise the available sugars in wine (both glucose and fructose, as well as the unfermentable pentoses that wine yeasts do not consume).

40|$|Background and Aims:  The {{majority}} of the acidity of a grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) berry {{is a result of}} the accumulation of l-tartaric (TA) and <b>l-malic</b> <b>acids</b> (MA). TA is synthesised from l-ascorbic acid (Asc, vitamin C), the metabolism of which is poorly characterised in grapevines. In a distinct pathway, oxalic acid (OA) is also formed from Asc degradation. The aim of this study was to develop a single method whereby the distribution of Asc and its catabolites from fruit and vegetative sources could be determined. Methods and Results:  Effective recoveries of total Asc, TA, OA and MA were achieved with this extraction method, while chromatographic separation was accomplished with reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). These results demonstrate that Asc and its catabolites TA and OA rapidly accumulate in immature berries, and that the Asc to dehydroascorbate ratio increases with berry maturity. Conclusions:  A method for the simultaneous analysis of Asc, TA, OA and MA in fruits is provided; moreover, we have demonstrated its use to study their distribution in fruits, rachis, leaves and roots. Significance of the Study:  This method enables accurate monitoring of the accumulation of Asc, permitting further research towards understanding acid metabolism during berry ripening. V. J.

40|$|Electroanalytical methods {{based on}} {{biosensor}} technology and differential PH measurement for the determination Pf L-lactic and <b>L-malic</b> <b>acids</b> in wine were developed. Lactic acid was determined {{according to two}} procedures consisting {{of the use of}} two lactate electrochemical biosensors, one based on a Clark 02 probe and the other based on the H 2 O 2 probe. The two probes were assembled employing a polymeric membrane where the enzyme lactate oxidase was previously immobilized. Both sensors exhibited high storage and operational stabilities, and good reproducibility when used in wine matrix. Measurement of lactate was carried out using two different flow-through cells assembled with the lactate probes. The low detection limit of these probes and the relatively high concentration of lactate in wine samples required a serial dilution in the range 1 : 100 to 1 : 200, thus eliminating all potential electrochemical or enzyme interferences present in the sample. Malic acid was determined using a differential commercially available pH-meter and an enzymatic procedure. For this analysis, we employed the malic enzyme (EC 1. 1. 1. 40) and the NADP+ cofactor. The pH variation due to the action of this enzyme on malic acid was found to be proportional to the malic acid present in the sample. Experimental parameters such as pH, temperature, and co-factor concentration were optimized, resulting in malate determination in less than 1 min with good reproducibility. Various samples of wine and wine musts were assayed for lactate with the two biosensor procedures, and for malate with differential pH-metry. The results when compared with those obtained with the commonly used spectrophotometric procedure correlated well. [ [...] . ...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{a growing}} {{attention}} to the dissolved organic matter (DOM) in terrestrial ecosystems and evidence {{of the fact that}} vegetation affects the quality of both undissolved and dissolved organic matter in soil, the role of DOM as a biological indicator is still poorly understood. In this work, the fertility of 59 sites, divided into eight key alliances of the order Fagetalia sylvaticae Pawl., was studied considering chemical and biological parameters such as soil DOM, hormone-like activity, low-molecular-weight (LMW) aliphatic and phenolic acids, and floristic data. Both non-parametric tests and principal component analysis (PCA) revealed differences between silver fir and beech forests and within each type of forest. There were also differences between neutrophilous and acidophilous types. What’s more, PCA reveals the dominance of the auxin (IAA) -like activity, and of some phenolic acids in distinguishing the acidophilous beeches (ACI) form the other types, whereas the gibberellin (GA) -like activity is more relevant in neutrophilous conditions such as thermophilous (THE) and mesophilous (MESO) beeches and montane (MO), high montane (HMA), high montane (HMC) silver fir forests. The GA-like activity is also related to the succinic, fumaric, malonic, and <b>L-malic</b> <b>acids</b> in the MO, HMA and HMC silver fir forests. Moreover, the role of LMW aliphatic acids in mobilizing the hormone-like activity, which improves forest growth, is stressed.

At concentrations between 1 and 100 lM, phenylacetic and protocatechuic acids inhibited root growth to the same extent as indoleacetic acid, while p-hydroxybenzoic acid had a stimulating effect comparable to that of gibberellic acid. The aliphatic and phenolic acids appear to be related to plant strategies that influence soil fertility affecting plant growth through rhizodeposition.

30|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} (LAB) {{contribute to}} taste and texture {{of a wide range}} of fermented products and inhibit the growth of spoilage bacteria (Mozzi et al. 2010). This includes the application of LAB in winemaking to increase the stability of wines that undergo barrel or bottle-ageing. This process, the malolactic fermentation (MLF), normally occurs after the alcoholic fermentation (AF). Apart from the decarboxylation of <b>L-malic</b> into L-lactic <b>acid,</b> MLF removes carbon sources of other microorganisms and bestows sensory changes to the wine (Bartowsky 2005). The genera mainly found during MLF are Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus and Oenococcus. Due to its high tolerance to low pH and higher amounts of SO 2 and ethanol, Oenococcos oeni is the primary species encountered during spontaneous MLF (Capozzi et al. 2010). Furthermore, O. oeni is the preferred organism for malolactic starter cultures, since the presence of Lactobacillus sp. and Pediococcus sp. during MLF can lead to development of spoilage aroma and off-flavours (Moreno-Arribas and Polo 2005). However, also O. oeni is able to generate for example acetic acid, diacetyl (buttery flavour), mannitol (viscous, sweet) and mousy off-flavour (Bartowsky 2009). Additionally, O. oeni needs several weeks to degrade malic acid completely, and growth of LAB is often delayed or can even fail (Zhang and Lovitt 2005). Consequently, innovations are desirable to reduce malic acid in a faster and more efficient way.|$|R
40|$|Malolactic {{fermentation}} (MLF), {{also known}} as the secondary fermentation in winemaking, involves the enzymatic decarboxylation of <b>L-malic</b> to L-lactic <b>acid,</b> by lactic acid bacteria, usually Oenococcus oeni. This conversion improves the organoleptic properties of wine and also decreases the risk of microbial spoilage. O. oeni is a notoriously fastidious microbe prone to slow growth, especially in the harsh physiochemical environment of wine: high ethanol, presence of sulfur dioxide, low pH and low temperature. Each of these factors influences the growth rate and metabolism, including MLF, of this organism. This study aimed to generate an improved strain of O. oeni with the ability to withstand the environmental pressures of wine, particularly high ethanol, using directed evolution (DE). Directed evolution is a non-recombinant method of generating improved strains. The process involves an organism mutating and potentially adapting to a high stress environment, in this case a high ethanol environment, over several hundred generations. This method has been used successfully to generate improved strains of other lactic acid bacteria and its efficacy as a method for the production of bacterial strains for the wine industry is detailed here. A continuous culture of O. oeni was established in MRS supplemented with 20 % (v/v) apple juice medium at 30 °C and 5 % (v/v) ethanol. Over the next 290 days and approximately 260 generations the ethanol concentration in the medium was gradually increased to 15 % (v/v) ethanol. A sample of this culture was screened for malic acid consumption (MLF) compared to the original parent. With proof of concept achieved, individual isolates from the DE culture were obtained in order to identify clones that demonstrated the ethanol tolerant phenotype to the greatest degree. An individual isolate, strain 90, was selected and its fermentation performance was characterised under a range of different ethanol (13, 15, 17 and 19 % (v/v)) concentrations and temperatures (15, 22 and 30 °C). This strain also retained viability for 48 hours in a medium supplemented with 22 % (v/v) ethanol, a condition that lead to an almost total loss of viability in the parent strain after only one hour. Finally the parent and two evolved strains (90 and 89) were sequenced using whole genome sequencing. 32 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were discovered in the evolved strains compared to the parent. Twenty of these are non-synonymous mutations located in nineteen different genes; five of these are located in both strains. None of the mutations appear in known O. oeni ethanol stress response genes. GO analysis, BLAST and current literature were used to analyse these changes and propose possible reasons for the new phenotype. This study is the first known use of DE for O. oeni strain improvement and results have confirmed DE can be successfully used as a technique for developing new strains. Furthermore these findings form the basis of exciting new studies further exploring the genetic basis for tolerance to ethanol stress. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Equilibrium constants K 1 for lactic, 2 -methyllactic, methoxyacetic, oxydiacetic, and citric acid reactions calculated from spectrophotometric equilibrium measurements and from kinetics (K 1 = k 1 /k- 1) are in good agreement. There is a linear correlation between the stability constants β 1 of the carboxylato complexes and the first dissociation constants Ka 1 of the carboxylic acids as expressed by log β 1 = (0. 48 ± 0. 03) pKa 1 + (2. 1 ± 0. 1). The formation rate constants k 1 are insensitive to the basicity and steric properties of the carboxylic acids at 25 °C, due to an excellent isokinetic relationship between ΔH 1 ⧧ and ΔS 1 ⧧ with an isokinetic temperature of 292 K, suggesting also that all of the carboxylic acids react via the same mechanism. Rate constants k- 1 are correlated with pKa 1 of the entering carboxylic acids according to log k- 1 = (0. 47 ± 0. 06) pKa 1 − (0. 7 ± 0. 2), indicating that the weaker the carboxylic acid, the larger k- 1. These facts together with the observation that a weak carboxylic acid is prone to form a strong complex as shown by the correlation between log β 1 and pKa 1 are interpreted in terms of a proton-assisted reaction mechanism which is further supported by the ionic strength dependence of the rate constant k- 1, consistent with a direct attack of an oxonium ion on Pd(H 2 O) 3 OOCR+ for the reverse reaction. High-pressure stopped-flow measurements at 25 °C give activation volumes ΔV 1 ⧧ = − 4. 9 ± 0. 2 cm 3 mol- 1, ΔV- 1 ⧧ = − 2. 7 ± 0. 5 cm 3 mol- 1 for malonic acid, and ΔV 1 ⧧ = − 3. 5 ± 0. 2 cm 3 mol- 1, ΔV- 1 ⧧ = − 1. 9 ± 0. 4 cm 3 mol- 1 for citric acid, respectively. Existing data so far for Pd(H 2 O) 42 + complex formation reactions obey a linear correlation between ΔV 1 ⧧ and partial molar reaction volumes ΔV 1 ° according to ΔV 1 ⧧ = (0. 92 ± 0. 04) ΔV 1 ° − (2. 2 ± 0. 2) cm 3 mol- 1, the slope of 0. 92 indicating that bond-making between palladium and the entering ligands largely dominates the formation of the transition state. There are no linear correlations between ΔV 1 ⧧ and partial molar volumes VL of the entering ligands, as has been claimed in previous literature for related reactions, or between ΔV 1 ⧧ and ΔS 1 ⧧...|$|R
40|$|In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, <b>l-malic</b> <b>acid</b> {{transport}} is not carrier mediated and {{is limited}} to slow, simple diffusion of the undissociated acid. Expression in S. cerevisiae of the MAE 1 gene, encoding Schizosaccharomyces pombe malate permease, markedly increased <b>l-malic</b> <b>acid</b> uptake in this yeast. In this strain, at pH 3. 5 (encountered in industrial processes), <b>l-malic</b> <b>acid</b> uptake involves Mae 1 p-mediated transport of the monoanionic form of the acid (apparent kinetic parameters: Vmax = 8. 7 nmol/mg/min; Km = 1. 6 mM) and some simple diffusion of the undissociated <b>l-malic</b> <b>acid</b> (Kd = 0. 057 min− 1). As total <b>l-malic</b> <b>acid</b> transport involved only low levels of diffusion, the Mae 1 p permease was further characterized in the recombinant strain. <b>l-Malic</b> <b>acid</b> transport was reversible and accumulative and depended on both the transmembrane gradient of the monoanionic acid form and the ΔpH component of the proton motive force. Dicarboxylic acids with stearic occupation closely related to <b>l-malic</b> <b>acid,</b> such as maleic, oxaloacetic, malonic, succinic and fumaric acids, inhibited <b>l-malic</b> <b>acid</b> uptake, suggesting that these compounds use the same carrier. We found that increasing external pH directly inhibited malate uptake, resulting in a lower initial rate of uptake and {{a lower level of}} substrate accumulation. In S. pombe, proton movements, as shown by internal acidification, accompanied malate uptake, consistent with the proton/dicarboxylate mechanism previously proposed. Surprisingly, no proton fluxes were observed during Mae 1 p-mediated <b>l-malic</b> <b>acid</b> import in S. cerevisiae, and intracellular pH remained constant. This suggests that, in S. cerevisiae, either there is a proton counterflow or the Mae 1 p permease functions differently from a proton/dicarboxylate symport...|$|E
40|$|Insufficient wine acidity {{can affect}} wine quality and stability. To {{overcome}} this problem, DL-malic acid {{can be added}} to the grape juice prior to fermentation. We have investigated the effect of DL-malic acid on wine fermentations and its influence on the final concentration of <b>L-malic</b> <b>acid,</b> naturally present in grape juice. To this end yeast strains that metabolise <b>L-malic</b> <b>acid</b> in different ways were tested and compared; namely, Schizosaccharomyces pombe (efficient <b>L-malic</b> <b>acid</b> degrader), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (non-degrader), hybrid strain S. cerevisiae x S. uvarum (intermediate degrader) and Saccharomyces uvarum (promoting <b>L-malic</b> <b>acid</b> synthesis). In all cases, D-malic acid passively entered the yeast cells and did not undergo malo-alcoholic fermentation. However, its presence in the juice, as a component of the mixture of D- and L- malic acid (DL-malic acid), reduced the amount of <b>L-malic</b> <b>acid</b> that can be degraded or synthesised by yeasts during malo-alcoholic fermentation...|$|E

40|$|Recombinant {{strains of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{with the ability}} to reduce wine acidity could have a {{significant}} influence on the future production of quality wines, especially in cool climate regions. <b>L-Malic</b> <b>acid</b> and L-tartaric acid contribute largely to the acid content of grapes and wine. The wine yeast S. cerevisiae is unable to effectively degrade <b>L-malic</b> <b>acid,</b> whereas the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe efficiently degrades high concentrations of <b>L-malic</b> <b>acid</b> by means of a malo-ethanolic fermentation. However, strains of Sz. pombe are not suitable for vinification due to the production of undesirable off-flavours. Heterologous expression of the Sz. pombe malate permease (mae 1) and malic enzyme (mae 2) genes on plasmids in S. cerevisiae resulted in a recombinant strain of S. cerevisiae that efficiently degraded up to 8 g/I <b>L-malic</b> <b>acid</b> in synthetic grape must and 6. 75 g/I <b>L-malic</b> <b>acid</b> in Chardonnay grape must. Furthermore, a strain of S. cerevisiae containing the mae 1 and mae 2 genes integrated in the genome efficiently degraded 5 g/I of <b>L-malic</b> <b>acid</b> in synthetic and Chenin Blanc grape musts. Furthermore, the malo-alcoholic strains produced higher levels of ethanol during fermentation, which is important for the production of distilled beverages. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

40|$|Lactobacillus casei can metabolize <b>l-malic</b> <b>acid</b> via malolactic enzyme (malolactic {{fermentation}} [MLF]) or malic enzyme (ME). Whereas {{utilization of}} <b>l-malic</b> <b>acid</b> via MLF {{does not support}} growth, the ME pathway enables L. casei to grow on <b>l-malic</b> <b>acid.</b> In this work, we have identified in the genomes of L. casei strains BL 23 and ATCC 334 a cluster consisting of two diverging operons, maePE and maeKR, encoding a putative malate transporter (maeP), an ME (maeE), and a two-component (TC) system belonging to the citrate family (maeK and maeR). Homologous clusters were identified in Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus uberis. Our results show that ME is essential for <b>l-malic</b> <b>acid</b> utilization in L. casei. Furthermore, deletion of either the gene encoding the histidine kinase or the response regulator of the TC system resulted {{in the loss of}} the ability to grow on <b>l-malic</b> <b>acid,</b> thus indicating that the cognate TC system regulates and is essential for the expression of ME. Transcriptional analyses showed that expression of maeE is induced in the presence of <b>l-malic</b> <b>acid</b> and repressed by glucose, whereas TC system expression was induced by <b>l-malic</b> <b>acid</b> and was not repressed by glucose. DNase I footprinting analysis showed that MaeR binds specifically to a set of direct repeats [5 ′-TTATT(A/T) AA- 3 ′] in the mae promoter region. The location of the repeats strongly suggests that MaeR activates the expression of the diverging operons maePE and maeKR where the first one is also subjected to carbon catabolite repression...|$|E
30|$|The induced {{recombinant}} cells, pre-cultured without <b>L-malic</b> <b>acid,</b> {{were not}} able to convert <b>L-malic</b> <b>acid</b> in malolactic test solution, although significant intracellular MLE activity was detected.

40|$|Continuous {{production}} of <b>L-malic</b> <b>acid</b> {{will be presented}} in this paper. The fumarase isolated from porcine heart, fumarase in the permeabilized non-growing cells of baker’s yeast and Saccharomyces bayanus (UVAFERM BC) were used as biocatalysts. In the {{production of}} <b>L-malic</b> <b>acid</b> with fumarase isolated from porcine hearts, there was no enzyme deactivation {{for a period of}} two days. At the average residence time of 4 hours, the conversion of about 80 % was achieved. Inactivation of the enzyme was observed using permeabilized cells. Thi s inactivation is described as a reversible process. C onversion of about 50 % was achieved with the remaining enzyme activity. A mathematical model that describes the production of <b>L-malic</b> <b>acid,</b> which contains the enzyme inactivation rate, was developed. Based on simulations, the used biocatalysts were compared. The results show that in the continuous production of <b>L-malic</b> <b>acid,</b> one milligram of purified enzyme corresponds to 68 g (wet weight) cells of Saccharomyces bayanus or 120 g (wet weight) cells of baker’s yeast...|$|E
