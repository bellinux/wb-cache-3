2500|$|Salvia expert Daniel Siebert has said, [...] "He {{must have}} already had some {{thoughts}} about suicide. I don't think salvia's just going to put thoughts into peoples' heads. Mentally healthy people don't decide to take such a drastic action based on [...] they had during a drug state. Psychedelics basically amplify a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> own internal stuff. If you're already having some kind of dark thoughts, a psychedelic experience could amplify that, and {{it could lead to}} a problem for some people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Neither {{the quality}} of Bow's voice nor her Brooklyn accent was an issue to Bow, her fans, or Paramount. However, Bow, like Charlie Chaplin, Louise Brooks, and most other silent film stars, did not embrace the novelty: [...] "I hate talkies ... they're stiff and limiting. You lose a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> cuteness, because there's no chance for action, and action is the most {{important}} thing to me." [...] A visibly nervous Bow had to do a number of retakes in The Wild Party because her eyes kept wandering up to the microphone overhead. [...] "I can't buck progress [...]. I have to do the best I can," [...] she said. In October 1929, Bow described her nerves as [...] "all shot", saying that she had reached [...] "the breaking point", and Photoplay cited reports of [...] "rows of bottles of sedatives" [...] by her bed.|$|E

6000|$|... "I know. That's the odd part of it, for I feel {{as though}} I had seen you {{for years and years}} and knew {{everything}} about you that one human being can know of another. Of course, too, I do know a good <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> life through George and Harût." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's bad news, old chap; fire in {{your office}} last evening. I'm afraid a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> private papers were burned. Robinson--that's your senior clerk, isn't it?--seems to {{have been on the}} spot trying to save things. He's badly singed about the face and hands. I'm afraid you must go at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're a fair spieler, child. But, by golly, I'd {{like to see}} you try {{to design}} a new manifold, or run a factory and keep a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> fellow reds from Czech-slovenski-magyar-godknowswheria on the job! You'd drop your {{theories}} so darn quick! I'm not any defender of things as they are. Sure. They're rotten. Only I'm sensible." ...|$|E

[...] "Of course we know you're a fairy, and can't be killed or hurt, and we know you've a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> magic <b>of</b> <b>your</b> own to help you. But, Ozma dear, {{in spite of all}} this you've been in trouble before, on account of wicked enemies, and it isn't right for the Ruler of all Oz to put herself in danger." ...|$|R

6000|$|In {{the first}} place, [...] "Wherever the <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> {{ministry}} shall fall, {{be mindful of}} baptising infants newly born, and perform it yourselves, without trusting the care of it to any other person: there is nothing at present of more importance. Do not wait till the parents bid you come; as they may easily neglect it, it behoves you to run through all the villages, {{to enter into the}} houses, and to christen all the infants you can find.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, hasn't it been beautiful?" [...] said Ludlow, with an {{involuntary}} lapse into earnestness. [...] "I {{was in the}} Park to-day for a little effect I wanted to get, and it was heartbreaking to leave the woods. I was away up in those forest depths that look wild {{in spite of the}} asphalt. If you haven't been there, you must go some day while the autumn color lasts. I saw a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> Synthesis ladies painting there. I didn't know but I might see you." ...|$|E

[...] He was {{efficiently}} working himself into a rage. [...] "Who you calling destitute? All I wanted was an advance till pay day! Got a check coming.

6000|$|... "I am {{sure you}} can tell me {{anything}} I may be ignorant of in that subject. You must have learnt a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> everything from <b>your</b> dear dead friend!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I don't," [...] Nat said, testily; [...] "there {{has been}} a deal too much {{fighting}} already. I understand holding out till the last, when there's a hope of somebody coming to relieve you; but what's the use of fighting, and getting a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> men killed, and raising the blood of those redskin devils to boiling point? If the colonel had given up the place at once, we should have saved a loss of 300 men, and Montcalm would have been glad enough to let us march off to Fort Edward." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, an old English book--one {{that you}} like; and I will choose {{a part of}} it that is toned quite in harmony with {{something}} in you. It shall waken your nature, fill your mind with music; it shall pass like a skilful hand over your heart, and make its strings sound. Your heart is a lyre, Robert; but the <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> life has not been a minstrel to sweep it, and it is often silent. Let glorious William come near and touch it. You will see how he will draw the English power and melody out of its chords." ...|$|E
6000|$|MAN (cunningly). Ah; {{but suppose}} I don't shoot you, {{what will happen}} then? Why, a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> cavalry--the {{greatest}} blackguards in your army--will burst into this pretty room of yours and slaughter me here like a pig; for I'll fight like a demon: they shan't get me into the street to amuse themselves with: I know what they are. Are you prepared to receive that sort of company in your present undress? (Raina, suddenly conscious of her nightgown, instinctively shrinks and gathers it more closely about her. He watches her, and adds, pitilessly) It's rather scanty, eh? (She turns to the ottoman. He raises his pistol instantly, and cries) Stop! (She stops.) Where are you going? ...|$|E

40|$|Getting mentored consumes <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> time, energy, and thought. Accordingly, every clinician-trialist {{needs to}} start by {{deciding}} whether it’s worth diverting these limited resources from their research, writing, clinical practice, teaching, and other academic and personal pursuits {{in order to get}} mentored. This first of a quartet of Rounds will sum-marize the evidence on whether and how getting mentored affects academic success, career satisfac-tion, and happiness. Then, if you find this evidence convincing, the second and third Rounds will take you through the structure and function of effec-tive mentoring, and the fourth will help you decide whether you would make a good mentor.

6000|$|... "We don't know," [...] said Abdul, testily. [...] "They {{wrote to}} us. They seem all right. Haven't {{you got a}} <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> people in <b>your</b> league that you never heard of?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I dunno. I just go by what folks say. I don't give {{it for a}} fact. But {{it would}} be a good thing. Rosemary West'd make you toe the mark if she came here, I'll bet a cent, for all she's so sweet and smiley on the face of her. They're always that way till they've caught them. But you need some one to bring you up. You're disgracing your pa and I feel for him. I've always thought an awful <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> pa ever since that night he talked to me so nice. I've never said a single swear word since, or told a lie. And I'd like to see him happy and comfortable, with his buttons on and his meals decent, and you young ones licked into shape, and that old cat of a Martha put in HER proper place. The way she looked at the eggs I brought her to-night. 'I hope they're fresh,' says she. I just wished they WAS rotten. But you just mind that she gives you all one for breakfast, {{including}} your pa. Make a fuss if she doesn't. That was what they was sent up for--but I don't trust old Martha. She's quite capable of feeding 'em to her cat." ...|$|E
60|$|Still, however, {{you must}} remember, that the tale told by one friend, {{and listened to}} by another, loses half its charms when {{committed}} to paper; and that the narratives to which you have attended with interest, as heard from the voice of him to whom they occurred, will appear less deserving of attention when perused in the seclusion of your study. But your greener age and robust constitution promise longer life than will, in all human probability, be the <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> friend. Throw, then, these sheets into some secret drawer of your escritoire till we are separated from each other's society by an event which may happen at any moment, and which must happen within {{the course of a}} few--a very few years. When we are parted in this world, to meet, I hope, in a better, you will, I am well aware, cherish more than it deserves the memory of your departed friend, and will find in those details which I am now to commit to paper, matter for melancholy, but not unpleasing reflection. Others bequeath to the confidants of their bosom portraits of their external features--I put into your hands a faithful transcript of my thoughts and feelings, of my virtues and of my failings, with the assured hope, that the follies and headstrong impetuosity of my youth will meet the same kind construction and forgiveness which have so often attended the faults of my matured age.|$|E
5000|$|President Barack Obama has {{praised the}} {{rejuvenation}} of Orleans Parish schools {{as a model}} for the rest of the country, stating: [...] "And because a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> public schools opened themselves up to new ideas and innovative reforms, we're actually seeing an improvement in overall achievement that is making the city a model for reform nationwide." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well, mademoiselle, it is a pity {{that they}} don’t {{exchange}} us. We give a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> trouble to <b>your</b> people, and the French prisoners give a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> trouble to ours, {{so it would}} be much better to restore us to our friends.” ...|$|R
