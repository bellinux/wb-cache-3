25|$|Although {{the railway}} was {{successful}} in technical and service terms, it is doubtful whether the shareholders got any of their money back and Brogdens had invested a <b>lot.</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> 8,678 shares issued (as of August 1866), Alexander had taken 792. By November 1867 £150,000 had been raised by shares and only £2,600 by debentures. In October 1868, shareholders funds were unchanged but debentures stood at £180,000, loans £17,500 and creditors at £65,000. It follows that Alexander's share investment, now lost, had been about £13,700, plus one share of £1,000 in the Mont Cenis Concessionary Company which had been formed earlier to negotiate concessions from the two governments.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} first {{broadcast}} in Australia on the Seven Network on 6 June 2002. Robin Oliver for The Sydney Morning Herald wrote [...] "Unlike {{any of the}} other seemingly compulsory Oz adventures to which British TV panders, this one presents a superior storyline while soaking up the views." [...] Oliver complimented the performances of Gary Sweet and Kimberley Joseph, and Ciaran Donnelly's direction. The Ages Debi Enker was critical, decrying the plot as [...] "fairly creaky" [...] and the locations as [...] "a very glossy ad for the sights of Sydney". She also thought Gary Sweet and James Nesbitt looked bored in their roles. In New Zealand, the episode was broadcast on TV ONE on 17 September 2002. The New Zealand Heralds reviewer Michele Hewitson was critical of the clichés in the script, particularly the stereotypical characterisation of Rod Ellison, who she described as [...] "a bit of a bastard". Hewitson was also critical of Karen's reaction to David's attempts to repair their relationship, and concluded by writing, [...] "God only knows why they had to drag the entire cast all the way to Australia.

On the first play of the drive, wide receiver Bryan Still {{broke away from the}} Tennessee defense and was wide open for a pass. Maurice DeShazo threw the ball to Still, but Still dropped the pass after it bounced off his chest, thus denying the Hokies a touchdown. Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer later cited the dropped pass as a critical turning point in the game, saying, [...] "I think if he could have made that catch, we could have gotten back in the game." [...] Tech player Torrian Gray agreed, saying, [...] "When he dropped the ball, that took a <b>lot</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> us." [...] After Still's dropped pass, DeShazo threw two incomplete passes and Virginia Tech punted back to Tennessee.

40|$|Abstract Background In November 2009, Sierra Leone {{conducted}} a preventive yellow fever (YF) vaccination campaign targeting individuals aged nine months and older in six health districts. The campaign was integrated with a measles follow-up campaign {{throughout the country}} targeting children aged 9 – 59 months. For both campaigns, the operational objective was to reach 95 % of the target population. During the campaign, we used clustered lot quality assurance sampling (C-LQAS) to identify areas of low coverage to recommend timely mop-up actions. Methods We divided the country in 20 non-overlapping lots. Twelve lots were targeted by both vaccinations, while eight only by measles. In each lot, five clusters of ten eligible individuals were selected for each vaccine. The upper threshold (UT) was set at 90 % and the lower threshold (LT) at 75 %. A lot was rejected for low vaccination coverage if more than 7 unvaccinated individuals (not presenting vaccination card) were found. After the campaign, we plotted the C-LQAS results against the post-campaign coverage estimations to assess if early interventions were successful enough to increase coverage in the lots that were {{at the level of}} rejection {{before the end of the}} campaign. Results During the last two days of campaign, based on card-confirmed vaccination status, five <b>lots</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 20 (25. 0 %) failed for having low measles vaccination coverage and three <b>lots</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 12 (25. 0 %) for low YF coverage. In one district, estimated post-campaign vaccination coverage for both vaccines was still not significantly above the minimum acceptable level (LT[*]=[*] 75 %) even after vaccination mop-up activities. Conclusion C-LQAS during the vaccination campaign was informative to identify areas requiring mop-up activities to reach the coverage target prior to leaving the region. The only district where mop-up activities seemed to be unsuccessful might have had logistical difficulties that should be further investigated and resolved. </p...|$|R

50|$|On the {{recommendation}} of Colonel Richard Moody, the Royal Engineers constructed a trail linking colonial capital New Westminster and False Creek to facilitate troop movement between the two points. The trail (which later became Kingsway) opened in 1860, and cut diagonally across Burrard Peninsula; land was set aside as a military reserve at a plateau along {{the road in the}} area of modern-day Metrotown. The road was improved following Burnaby's municipal incorporation in 1892, and the parallel Central Park interurban line connecting Vancouver and New Westminster opened the previous year, making the area increasingly favourable for settlement. Consequently, the provincial government established a series <b>of</b> holding <b>lots</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the military reserve in the 1890s to accommodate working class residents. The lots were drawn at right angles to the interurban line, which ran from the northwest to the southeast, accounting for Metrotown's street orientation.|$|R
