5|$|As a lawyer, Sawyer {{focused on}} civil <b>litigation</b> <b>in</b> {{corporate}} law, {{at which he}} excelled. He also {{spent much of his}} time in the field of civil liberties, for which he became more well-known but less well-compensated. In 1953, he was one of several defense attorneys in the case of United States v. Kuzma, a prosecution of Communist sympathizers under the Smith Act, which barred anyone from advocating for the overthrow of the American government. The defendants were found guilty, but their convictions were reversed in 1957 after the United States Supreme Court overturned the Smith Act in Yates v. United States.|$|E
5|$|The Clause {{has led to}} {{very little}} <b>litigation,</b> <b>in</b> part because of its overlap (as a {{practical}} matter) with the venue provision of Article Three and Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Further, {{with the exception of}} the District of Wyoming, which includes the portions of Yellowstone National Park in Idaho and Montana, no federal judicial district includes the territory of two or more states (although the short-lived District of Potomac once did).|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{road with}} a similar routing to SR54 was mentioned in newspapers in 1908, and was paved by 1935. The South Bay Freeway was constructed next as an expressway from National City to Spring Valley. The freeway west to I-5 and the Sweetwater River flood channel were built at the same time, although both were delayed due to environmental concerns and <b>litigation.</b> <b>In</b> the late 1990s and the 2000s, {{the entirety of the}} western portion of SR54 was converted to a freeway, while the entire portion inside the El Cajon city limits was returned to that city.|$|E
5|$|A {{key element}} to Colt's success was {{vigorous}} protection of his patent rights. Even though he lawfully held the only patent on a revolver, scores of imitators copied {{his work and}} Colt found himself constantly in <b>litigation.</b> <b>In</b> {{each one of these}} cases, Colt's lawyer, Edward N. Dickerson, deftly exploited the patent system and successfully shut down Colt's competitors. However, Colt's zealous protection of his patents greatly impeded firearms development as a whole in the United States. His preoccupation with patent infringement suits slowed his own company's transition to the cartridge system and blocked other firms from pursuing revolver designs. At the same time, Colt's policies forced some competing inventors to greater innovation by denying them key features of his mechanism; as a result they created their own.|$|E
5|$|After briefly reading law in Columbus, Ohio, Hayes moved east {{to attend}} Harvard Law School in 1843. Graduating with an LL.B, he was {{admitted}} to the Ohio bar in 1845 and opened his own law office in Lower Sandusky (now Fremont). Business was slow at first, but he gradually attracted a few clients and also represented his uncle Sardis in real estate <b>litigation.</b> <b>In</b> 1847, Hayes became ill with what his doctor thought to be tuberculosis. Thinking a change in climate would help, he considered enlisting in the Mexican–American War, but on his doctor's advice he instead visited family in New England. Returning from there, Hayes and his uncle Sardis made a long journey to Texas, where Hayes visited with Guy M. Bryan, a Kenyon classmate and distant relative. Business remained meager on his return to Lower Sandusky, and Hayes decided to move to Cincinnati.|$|E

5|$|Apple's {{litigation}} over {{object code}} {{contributed to the}} development of contemporary copyright law because the company's object code cases brought different results in different courts, creating a conflict of laws that resulted in international <b>litigation.</b> <b>In</b> the 1980s, Apple litigated two copyright cases with central issues that included the question of whether object code (as contrasted with source code) of a computer program is subject to copyright laws. A third case in which Apple was not a party but that involved the Apple decisions followed in New Zealand. The specific cases were Computer Edge Pty. Ltd. v Apple Computer Inc. (1986, Australia) ("Computer Edge"), Apple Computer Inc. v Mackintosh Computers Ltd., (Canada, 1987) ("Apple v. Mackintosh"), and IBM v. Computer Imports Ltd. ("IBM v. Computer Imports"), (New Zealand, 1989).|$|E
5|$|Besides {{being criticized}} for its limited powers, {{there is also}} some concern that the Council's {{responsibilities}} may go too far. By taking up the function of scrutinizing existing and prospective legislation for differentiating measures and inconsistencies with fundamental liberties, the Council may be encroaching on the functions of constitutional interpretation, which is traditionally the function of courts. Even though the Council has the additional advantage of identifying potentially unconstitutional legislation at an early stage, thereby preventing unnecessary <b>litigation</b> <b>in</b> the future, there is doubt as to the ability of the Council to take on such a task. Given that constitutional interpretation is traditionally the function of lawyers and the courts, the task may be best carried out by the legally trained members of the PCMR.|$|E
5|$|Monsanto {{stated that}} he was {{infringing}} its patents because the soybeans he bought from the elevator were products that he purchased for use as seeds without a license from Monsanto; Bowman {{stated that he}} had not infringed due to patent exhaustion on the first sale of seed to whatever farmers had produced the crops that he bought from the elevator, on the grounds that for seed, all future generations are embodied in the first generation that was originally sold. Bowman had previously purchased and planted Monsanto seeds under a license agreement promising not to save seeds from the resulting crop, but that agreement was not relevant to his purchase of soybean seed from the grain elevator nor to the <b>litigation.</b> <b>In</b> 2007, Monsanto sued Bowman for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.|$|E
