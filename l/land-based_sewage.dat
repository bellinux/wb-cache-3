50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that <b>land-based</b> <b>sewage</b> {{wastewater}} entering the Lagoon has resulted in bacterial levels far exceeding acceptable norms. Research by Environmental Protection in the Caribbean (EPIC) on lagoon and watershed water quality has shown that enterococci bacterial levels exceeded allowable levels in 96% (n=26) of samples. Land-based sites {{were found to be}} more polluted than the Lagoon, indicating that a significant portion of contamination originates from the land and not just from boats.|$|E
40|$|<b>Land-based</b> <b>sewage</b> {{pollution}} {{is a major}} threat to the health of near-shore coral reefs. Macroalgal delta N- 15 -values are useful indicators for tracking nitrogen sources and sewage input; however, the direct link between delta N- 15 -values of macroalgae and the coral condition, including live coral cover, species richness, and juvenile coral density, is unclear. Macroalgal delta N- 15 -values of two species, Lobophora variegata and Tricleocarpa oblongata, were measured in Wenchang (northeast Hainan Island, South China Sea) in both the dry and wet seasons, to assess the influence of nitrogen sources and nutrient stress resulting from sewage input or upwelling on the condition of corals. Macroalgal delta N- 15 -values showed that shallow stations between the reef and the coast were severely affected by sewage input (e. g., river discharges and aquaculture ponds), whereas deep stations {{on the outside of the}} reef were influenced by upwelling-based nutrients. Correlation and redundancy analysis demonstrated that delta N- 15 -values of L. variegata had a stronger relation with coral condition than any other environmental parameter (e. g., water quality index, turbidity, and dissolved nutrients), with significant negative correlations in both the dry and wet seasons. Thus, macroalgal delta N- 15 -values can be used to determine where nutrient stress is negatively affecting corals, highlighting the links of human activities and coastal upwelling with marine ecosystems.

Mätningarna har utförts på respektive anläggnings biologiska steg där de organiska {{material}} och ämnen bryts ner. De faktorer som har granskats är vilka metoder som används för att syresätta avloppsvattnet, vilken syrehalt som uppnås och hur mycket energi syresättningen förbrukar. Ett test gjordes också på Marinflocs egna anläggning där vi undersökte om det är någon skillnad i tid att syresätta rent vatten kontra obehandlat avloppsvatten. Undersökningarna visade att de 4 landbaserade reningsverken som besöktes syresätter avloppsvattnet efter samma princip, genom bottenluftning, och att de samtliga ligger på en syrehalt mellan 1, 8 – 5, 9 mg syre {{per liter}} vatten. Marinflocs nuvarande anläggning använder sig av en annan metod än de övriga och ligger på en syrehalt om cirka 12 mg/l. De visade sig att det tar längre tid att syresätta obehandlat avloppsvatten än rent vatten på deras anläggning.  This essay {{has been done}} {{at the request of}} Marinfloc AB. It consists of various measurements and experiments investigating the sewage water treatment on a number of different plants. The measurements were executed in the part of the plants called secondary treatment. The objective with secondary treatment is to let micro-organisms remove dissolved and suspended biological and organic matter. The factors which were investigated were which methods are used to oxygenate the sewage water, what level of oxygen saturation is obtained with each method and the power consumption required oxygenating the sewage water. An experiment was carried out on Marinflocs’ own sewage treatment plant with the objective to determine if there is any time difference in oxygenating pure water versus unprocessed sewage water. The conclusion reached was that the four <b>land-based</b> <b>sewage</b> treatment plants that were investigated oxygenate by the same principle. The oxygenation is done by aeration from the bottom in respective aeration tank. The level of oxygen saturation was between 1, 8 – 5, 9 mg oxygen per liter sewage water in all plants. Marinflocs’ current sewage treatment plant uses another principle to oxygenate and its oxygen saturation was measured to a level of 12 mg/l. The experiment on Marinflocs’ own sewage treatment plant concluded that there is a time difference in oxygenating pure water versus unprocessed sewage water. The pure water gets oxygenated faster. ...|$|E

40|$|Species-area curves {{calculated}} from line-intercept transect surveys on 15 reefs in three regions of Indonesia allow {{estimation of the}} relative decrease in within-habitat coral species diversity associated with different types of reef degradation. Reefs subject to <b>land-based</b> pollution (<b>sewage,</b> sedimentation, and/or industrial pollution) show 30 – 50 % reduced diversity at 3 m, and 40 – 60 % reduced diversity at 10 m depth relative to unpolluted comparison reefs in each region. Bombed or anchor damaged reefs are ca 50 % less diverse in shallow water (3 m depth) than are undamaged reefs in the same region, but at 10 m depth the relative decrease is only 10 %. Comparison reefs in the Java Sea are ca 20 % less diverse {{than their counterparts in}} Ambon, Maluku. The results, compared with a previous survey in the Spermonde Archipelago found a 25 % decrease in generic diversity of corals on two reefs resampled after 15 years. The decreased diversity on reefs subject to land-based pollution implies a dramatic, rapid decrease in Indonesian reef-based fisheries resources...|$|R
