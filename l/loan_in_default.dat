The developer, Shelbourne Development Group, Inc., began construction in 2007 using its own funds. It also obtained “starter” funds from Bank of America via a loan agreement that required Shelbourne to demonstrate proof of a construction loan by November 1, 2008. Although Shelbourne sold thirty percent of the building, it could not obtain construction financing due to the worsening global financial and credit crisis. Bank of America declared the <b>loan</b> <b>in</b> <b>default</b> and sued Shelbourne for the outstanding principal, interest, and fees. As part of its defense, Shelbourne argued that the court should excuse it (temporarily) from providing proof of a construction loan, due to the ‘unforeseeable and unprecedented economic downturn and recession, particularly in the real estate market. ’...|$|E

40|$|A mother, her daughter, and her {{son-in-law}} received {{title to}} a North Carolina home as joint tenants with right of survivorship. Little did the mother {{know that she}} was almost instantly destroying the newborn joint tenancy when, in order to finance the purchase price, she alone executed a mortgage note and deed of trust at the closing. When she died several years later with that mortgage <b>loan</b> <b>in</b> <b>default,</b> a legal dispute arose centered on whether 2 ̆ 2 severance 2 ̆ 2 of the joint tenancy had occurred. Following traditional joint tenancy law theory, the Court of Appeals decided somewhat reluctantly that the joint tenancy was indeed severed at the very closing during which it was successfully created; for by executing the deed of trust, the mother had conveyed 2 ̆ 2 title 2 ̆ 2 according to North Carolina 2 ̆ 7 s title theory of mortgage law. Under a common law 2 ̆ 2 four unities 2 ̆ 2 analysis, her execution of the deed of trust unilaterally destroyed the unity of title required for a joint tenancy and automatically converted it into a tenancy in common. Contrary to what was most likely intended as part of an informal family estate and eldercare plan, her fifty percent undivided interest in the home remained in her estate at her death and did not pass by survivorship to her daughter and son-in-law. 2 ̆ 7 This article addresses key real property and public policy issues triggered by the 1990 legislative reincarnation of the joint tenancy with right of survivorship in North Carolina with a special emphasis on creation and severance issues. It also focuses on piecemeal statutory amendments and revisions to North Carolina joint tenancy law since 1990. The authors 2 ̆ 7 analysis leads to the following conclusions: First, because joint tenancy creation is now intent-based, not unities-based, joint tenancy termination should likewise be intent-based, not unities-destruction-based. Second, unilateral 2 ̆ 2 stealth 2 ̆ 2 severances of joint tenancies are contrary to public policy, unless accompanied by effective prior notice to the other joint tenant or tenants. Third, North Carolina General Statute section 41 - 2 requires substantial and comprehensive revision to further clarify the contemporary law of joint tenancy in North Carolina. Fourth, substantial improvement in the law 2 ̆ 7 s transparency is required in the legislative process if all interested parties, including consumers, are to have a meaningful opportunity to provide input when important real property laws are added, revised, or deleted from the General Statutes...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{two aspects}} of banking crises: the choices that banks make to passively roll over <b>loans</b> <b>in</b> <b>default</b> versus actively pursuing their claims; and choices by regulators to ‘punish’ passive and insolvent banks versus rescuing them. Banks may choose to roll over <b>loans</b> <b>in</b> order to hide their poor financial conditions or to gamble for resurrection. Regulators can reduce creditor passivity through their ex-ante choice of monitoring capability and their ex-post choice of policy for distressed banks. Yet, if too many banks are discovered to be passive or insolvent, a situation labelled ‘too-many-to-fail’ (TMTF) may arise, whereby it is less costly to rescue than to close large numbers of banks. Banks may implicitly collude through their choice of actions in order to trigger TMTF. A principal result of the analysis {{is that when the}} regulator reacts to the threat of banks triggering TMTF, it is by ‘softening’. One form of softening involves lowering the ex-ante monitoring capacity and ‘punishing’ a smaller number of banks ex post. More undetected passivity will thus exist in equilibrium than if TMTF could not be triggered. Banking; Bankruptcy; economies in transition; prudential regulation...|$|R
5000|$|As {{with other}} {{insurance}}, {{an insurance policy}} {{is part of the}} insurance transaction. In mortgage insurance, a master policy issued to a bank or other mortgage-holding entity (the policyholder) lays out the terms and conditions of the coverage under insurance certificates. The certificates document the particular characteristics and conditions of each individual loan. The master policy includes various conditions including exclusions (conditions for denying coverage), conditions for notification of <b>loans</b> <b>in</b> <b>default,</b> and claims settlement. The contractual provisions in the master policy have received increased scrutiny since the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States. Master policies generally require timely notice of default include provisions on monthly reports, time to file suit limitations, arbitration agreements, and exclusions for negligence, misrepresentation, and other conditions such as pre-existing environmental contaminants. The exclusions sometimes have [...] "incontestability provisions" [...] which limit the ability of the mortgage insurer to deny coverage for misrepresentations attributed to the policyholder if twelve consecutive payments are made, although these incontestability provisions generally don't apply to outright fraud.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MDF) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2011. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: A {{sound and}} {{favourable}} financial climate {{is necessary for}} any forward-looking economy to thrive. This, amongst others, includes {{the extent to which}} the commercial banks are able to discharge their intermediating role in the demand and supply of credit necessary to sustain commercial businesses. Indeed, in the last decade, the Nigerian banking industry has witnessed swings with the attendant effects on the business community. One of the downsides has been the incidence of loan default which led to many banks recording astronomical levels of bad <b>loans</b> <b>in</b> their 2008 financial reports. The drastic measures taken by the Central Bank of Nigeria of relieving eight CEOs of their jobs in September 2009 further highlights the import of this subject matter. This paper gives an overview of the concept of <b>loan</b> <b>default</b> <b>in</b> Nigerian commercial banks ranging from the causes to the remedies currently in place to checkmate it. A field survey on loan officers, credit analysts and credit risk managers in some select banks was carried out. The findings reveal that the banks have a rather cautious approach to lending with certain classes of loans classified. Causal factors leading to loan delinquencies categorised into environmental, bank specific and borrower specific factors were analysed to have contributed equally to causing <b>loan</b> <b>default</b> <b>in</b> Nigeria. Lastly, the regression results indicated that there was a significant relationship between measures adopted by the banks in the face of incre...|$|R
