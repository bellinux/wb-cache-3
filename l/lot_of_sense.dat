I think this position is the one on which the social scientists are basing their position. … If {{you look at the}} genes that do make a difference, selected genes, which are a tiny handful of the whole, you do find a number of differences, not very many, but a number of interesting differences between races as to which genes have been selected. This, of course, makes a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>sense,</b> because once the human family dispersed from its homeland in Africa, people faced different environments on each continent, different climates, different evolutionary challenges, and each group adapted to its environment in its own way.|$|E

Human grasping integrates a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> different <b>senses.</b> In particular, the tactile sensing is very important for a stable grasping motion.

In this paper we present an adaptive controlling mechanism which enables a robot to grasp objects of different weights. Thereby, we only use the proprioceptive sensors like positions and electric current at the joints and force sensors at the end-effectors providing the robot with tactile feedback. We implemented and tested our approach on a humanoid robot. ...|$|R

In the early 1920s, his painting still shows the influence of the Spring Salon, with rounded forms in more muted colours. However, inspired by the scenes of his native Dalmatia, and driven by his own personal demons, Job went on to become one of the most expressive painters in the Croatian modern art scene of the 1920s and 30s. In his later works he demonstrated fauvism techniques and strong, expressive use of colour. Job saw landscape as a symbol, and used colour as an expression of his emotions, his personal experience of life and his reaction to the environment and its native people. His art was grounded in the earthy island lifestyle, and he pursued his own personal vision. As the critic Igor Zidić says [...] "All of the content in Job's work, from 1928 to his death, are locally and regionally marked, always concrete, borrowed from the real world and the little towns of Dalmatia in which he scrimped and lived, full of ambiental tone and colour, melodies, events and figures...

2500|$|Early Anglo-Saxon society {{attached}} great {{significance to}} the horse; a horse {{may have been an}} acquaintance of the god Wodan, and/or they may have been (according to Tacitus) confidants of the gods. Horses were closely associated with gods, especially Odin and Freyr. Horses {{played a central role in}} funerary practices as well as in other rituals. Horses were prominent symbols of fertility, and there were many horse fertility cults. The rituals associated with these include horse fights, burials, consumption of horse meat, and horse sacrifice. Hengist and Horsa, the mythical ancestors of the Anglo-Saxons, were associated with horses, and references to horses are found throughout Anglo-Saxon literature. Actual horse burials in England are relatively rare and [...] "may point to influence from the continent". A well-known Anglo-Saxon horse burial (from the sixth/seventh century) is Mound 17 at Sutton Hoo, a few yards from the more famous ship burial in Mound 1. A sixth-century grave near Lakenheath, Suffolk, yielded the body of a man next to that of a [...] "complete horse in harness, with a bucket of food by its head." [...] Pagan Anglo-Saxons worshipped at a variety of different sites across their landscape, some of which were apparently specially built temples and others that were natural geographical features such as sacred trees, hilltops or wells. According to place name evidence, these sites of worship were known alternately as either hearg or as wēoh. Almost no poem from before the Norman Conquest, no matter how Christian its theme, is not steeped in pagan symbolism and their integration into the new faith goes beyond the literary sources. Thus, as Lethbridge reminds us, [...] "to say, 'this is a monument erected in Christian times and therefore the symbolism on it must be Christian,' is an unrealistic approach.

50|$|The opening twenty {{pages of}} Blast 1 contain the Vorticist manifesto, written by Lewis with {{assistance}} from Pound {{and signed by}} Lewis, Wadsworth, Pound, William Roberts, Helen Saunders, Lawrence Atkinson, Jessica Dismorr, and Gaudier-Brzeska. Epstein chose not to sign the manifesto, although his work was featured. There is also a (positive) critique of Kandinsky's Concerning the Spiritual In Art, a faintly patronising exhortation to suffragettes not to destroy works of art, a review of a London exhibition of Expressionist woodcuts, and a last dig at Marinetti by Wyndham Lewis:Futurism, as preached by Marinetti, is largely Impressionism up-to-date.To this is added his Automobilism and Nietzsche stunt, With a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> good <b>sense</b> and vitality at his disposal, he hammers away in the blatant mechanism of his Manifestos, at his idee fixe of Modernity.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} impact of the First World War on English Cathedral music, both during the long four years and in its aftermath. Throughout this study, {{reference}} will be made specifically to three English cathedrals: York Minster, Durham and St Paul’s. The examination will be carried out chronologically, in three parts: before the war (part one), during the war (part two) and after the war (part three). Each of these three parts consists of two chapters. Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 help to set the scene and offer context. In chapters 2 - 5 there is a more focused and systematic investigation into the day-to-day administrative challenges that the Cathedrals faced, followed in each chapter by an assessment of the musical programme. Chapter 6 examines the long-term impact of the war on British cathedral music, especially in the centenary anniversary years. The Great War is often perceived as a complete break with the past, yet it also represented an imaginative continuity of sorts. As such, 1914 - 18 {{can be seen as a}} period of twilight in a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>senses.</b> The war managed to bring the flirtation with modernism, which was undoubtedly happening at the beginning of the century, to at least a temporary halt. Through the examination of the archives of the three cathedrals, this thesis investigates how the world war left its mark on the musical life of this portion of English religious and music life, during and after the war, drawing national comparisons as well as showing the particulars of each cathedral...|$|R
50|$|He later {{stated in}} another address;I think Bush Administration {{has stated that}} Iraq has weapons of mass destruction, and that's as simple as {{they want to keep}} it. They don't {{want to get into the}} nitty-gritty things such as if you bury a Scud missile to hide it from detection, there is a little thing called corrosion. Where do you hide the fuel, how do you make this stuff up, how do you align it. Because when you {{disassemble}} it, there is a process called re-alignment. There is a factory involved in that. And then you have to test launch it to make sure that the alignment works, and that's detectable, and they haven't done that. There is a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> common <b>sense</b> things that go into consideration of whether or not Iraq has a operational weapons of mass destruction capability.|$|R
