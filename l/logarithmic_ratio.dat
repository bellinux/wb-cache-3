5000|$|Another type of {{curve is}} called the <b>logarithmic</b> <b>ratio</b> (also known as [...] "audio taper", or an inverse-logarithmic ratio. [...] the log/audio-taper more closely matches human hearing, with finer control at lower levels, {{increasing}} dramatically past the 50% point. Here {{it is important to}} remember that the perceived volume of a sound has a logarithmic relationship with its level in decibels. A fade that works on a logarithmic scale would thus counteract the curve of a linear fade. In fade-ins the shape of the perceived volume curve looks like the level in decibels pulled towards the middle part of the line to the bottom right corner. The fade-out in turn looks like it has been pulled toward the bottom-left corner. A logarithmic fade takes a line that has already been curved and straightens it out 15. The logarithmic fade sounds consistent and smooth since the perceived volume is increased over the whole duration of the fade. This makes this curve very handy for fading standard pieces of music. It is best used on a long fade-out since the fade has a perceived linear nature. Also a fade-out sounds very neutral when incorporated to parts of music with natural ambience. In cross-fades this type of curve sounds very natural. When this curve is applied the perceived volume of the fade’s midpoint is at about 50% of the maximum - when the two sections are summed the output volume is fairly constant.|$|E

40|$|The {{relative}} fitness of viral variants {{has previously}} been defined as {{the slope of the}} <b>logarithmic</b> <b>ratio</b> of the genotype or phenotype frequencies in time plots of pairwise competition experiments. Developing mathematical models for such experiments by employing the conventional coefficient of selection s, we demonstrate that this <b>logarithmic</b> <b>ratio</b> gives the fitness difference, rather than the relative fitness. This fitness difference remains proportional to the actual replication rate realized in the particular experimental setup and hence cannot be extrapolated to other situations. Conversely, the conventional relative fitness (1 � s) should be more generic. We develop an approach to compute the generic relative fitness in conventional competition experiments. This involves an estimation of the total viral replication during the experiment and requires an estimate of the average lifetime of productively infected cells. The novel approach is illustrated by estimating the relative fitness, i. e., the relative replication rate, of a set of zidovudine-resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 variants. A tool for calculating the relative fitness from observed changes in viral load and genotype (or phenotype) frequencies is publically available on the website a...|$|E

So far, it has been tackled in two ways: by modeling neurons or small circuits in great detail, and through large-scale models representing each area with {{a small number of}} differential equations. To bridge the gap between these two approaches, we construct a spiking network model extending earlier work on the cortical microcircuit by Potjans & Diesmann (2014) to all 32 areas of the macaque visual cortex in the parcellation of Felleman & Van Essen (1991).
