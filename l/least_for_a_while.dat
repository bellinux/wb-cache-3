5|$|The {{foggy weather}} made it {{difficult}} to see positions from either side, but Frederick and his commanders used the fog to their advantage. Leaving a cavalry unit and a cluster of infantry in front of the northernmost end of the Austrian line (the Austrian right), Frederick deployed the remainder (and bulk) of his forces toward Leuthen itself; Charles saw them start their redeployment, and may have interpreted the maneuver as withdrawal, at <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b>|$|E

Jaroslaw Engel, from Poland, managed to use builders' scaffolding {{to get out of the}} school, but he was caught in the street by some police drivers who smashed him over the head, laid him on the ground and stood over him smoking while his blood ran out across the tarmac.|$|E

The team not only worked for Stampede Wrestling while in Canada, but also worked for NWA All-Star Wrestling based in Vancouver, British Columbia. The Fabulous Kangaroos’ 1965 run in NWA All-Star Wrestling {{turned out to be}} the last time the original Kangaroos teamed together. In June 1965, the Kangaroos lost to Don Leo Jonathan and Jim Hardy and then split up. Heffernan left Australia to tour the world in 1953 and wanted to return to his homeland, while Costello was determined to remain in the United States at <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> longer.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} stem the turmoil, Crispi offered Colajanni the Ministry of Agriculture, which he refused. When riots on the island got out of hand, Crispi asked Colajanni to {{undertake}} a mission of appeasement on Sicily. On January 3, 1894, only four days after Crispi had promised Colajanni {{there would be no}} state of siege, martial law was declared in the island. General Roberto Morra di Lavriano was dispatched with 40,000 troops to restore order. Colajanni condemned the Fasci leaders for lacking to keep the peace. After conferring with general Morra he issued a manifesto in which he urged the people to restore order. He argued that the government was engaged in bettering the working conditions and deserved their confidence, at <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> People breaking the peace he called fools and traitors.|$|E
25|$|Russkaya Mysl {{released}} The Family Idyll (Semeynaya idillia, 1890), a {{year later}} another symbolic poem Death (Smert) appeared in Severny Vestnik. In 1891 Merezhkovsky and Gippius made their first journey to Europe, staying mostly in Italy and France; the poem End of the Century (Konetz Veka) inspired by the European trip, came out two years later. On their return home the couple stayed {{for a while in}} Guppius' dacha at Vyshny Volochyok; it was here that Merezhkovsky started working on his first novel, The Death of the Gods. Julian the Apostate. A year later it was finished, but by this time the situation with Severny Vestnik has changed: outraged by Akim Volynsky's intrusive editorial methods, Merezhkovsky severed ties with the magazine, at <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> In the late 1891 he published his translation of Sophocles' Antigona in Vestnik Evropy, part of Goethe's Faustus (in Russkoye Obozrenye) and Euripides' Hyppolite (in Vestnik Evropy again). The latter came out in 1893, after the couple's second trip to Europe where their first encounter with Dmitry Filosofov occurred. Merezhkovsky's vivid impressions of Greece and the subsequent spurt of the new ideas provided the foundation for his second novel.|$|E

500|$|Stephen hired mercenaries to man his forts, which {{diminished the}} {{military}} {{role of the}} boyars' retinues within the Moldavian military forces. He also set up a personal guard 3,000 strong and, at <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> an Armenian-only unit. To strengthen the defence of Moldavia, he obliged the peasantry to bear arms. Moldavian chronicles recorded that if [...] "he found a peasant lacking arrows, bow or sword, or coming to the army without spurs for the horse, he mercilessly put that man to death." [...] The military reforms increased Moldavia's military potential, enabling Stephen to muster an army of more than 40,000 strong.|$|E

Iwens reported {{a number of}} instances of kind treatment from, among others, a German airman, who was shocked by the suffering {{of the children in the}} ghetto. His brother (later among the murdered), similarly was well-treated by a German unit where he worked in the kitchen. On another occasion, two German soldiers, aware that the SD was selecting for execution Jews who had no work, pretended they were needed for work with their unit, thus saving, at <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> a group of about 30 people.

40|$|Does the {{president}} {{have the ability to}} set the congressional agenda? Agenda setting is <b>a</b> prerequisite <b>for</b> influence, so this is an important element in understanding presidential–legislative relations. We focus on the State of the Union address and show that popular presidents can, indeed, cause Congress to shift attention to those topics most emphasized. The impact is tempered by divided government and time, however. No matter the state of divided government, however, popular presidents can direct congressional attention, at <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while.</b> Unpopular presidents, by contrast, are irrelevant...|$|R
5000|$|P-Funk somehow became {{related with}} space disco, at <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> short <b>while.</b> The {{main reason for}} this could be that during the very early 1980s, the discothèques in France used to market P-Funk as the {{continuation}} of American disco after the Disco Demolition Night {{that took place in}} the United States on 1979. Also, the disco band Chic produced Sheila B. Devotion's biggest hit, [...] "Spacer", which was a milestone of the Space Disco style, so it was natural to tell to the euro disco fans that P-Funk was Space Disco Related. The stage (and first video) appearances of the P-Funk artists, helped a lot in that direction.|$|R

The race's contract was due to expire in 2018, but its future had been under threat due to rising hosting fees and declining ticket sales. Malaysia's youth and sports minister at the time Khairy Jamaluddin said on Twitter: [...] "I think we should stop hosting the F1. At <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> Cost too high, returns limited. When we first hosted the F1 it was a big deal. First in Asia outside Japan. Now so many venues.

40|$|With {{the release}} of Theodor Herzl s The Jewish State in 1896, Zionism became a {{political}} movement with a clear goal; a Jewish homeland. The desire first arose in Europe, but soon American Jews followed suit. The American Zionist movement was riddled with internal strife from the get-go, and it took {{the involvement of the}} People s Attorney, Louis D. Brandeis, and his friendship with the American President, Woodrow Wilson, to unite the American Zionists, at <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while.</b> President Wilson quickly endorsed the Balfour Declaration, largely because of his friendship with Brandeis. This thesis is about the period between 1897 and 1930, and the main focus is on Louis D. Brandeis and the impact his leadership and his friendship with President Wilson had on the American Zionist movement...|$|R

Leah returns covered in white feathers and Marion recognizes this as a warning from the Shawnee Indians to other members of the Shawnee tribe not to enter a nearby valley. Realizing that the Shawnee have superstitions about the valley, Marion leads the group into the valley, knowing that if the Shawnee were to return, they would not follow the pioneers into the valley because of various Native American superstitions some of the tribes have in regards to this particular valley.|$|R

50|$|Lieutenant John Bell Hood, {{a future}} Confederate general left Fort Mason on July 5 of 1857 {{to patrol the}} desert with twenty-five men of the 2nd Cavalry.

The trail led straight through a wasteland but Hood believed his men could survive in the desert, at <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> short <b>while,</b> if the Comanches could. After 150 miles {{with only a few}} sources of water, Hood began to think that catching the enemy would be impossible but still he pushed on.

50|$|The {{earliest}} document attesting to {{the monastery}} {{dates from the}} 10th century and describes {{the foundation of the}} monastery by three nobles from Anagni. A series of very interesting charters and trials from the eleventh through 13th century speak to a small rural monastery with properties {{in the area of the}} original fundus, which despite its meagre size and income managed to become embroiled in regional and papal politics of the central Middle Ages, culminating in the suppression of the monastery in 1297 by Pope Boniface VIII. After the death of the monastery, the village remained at <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while,</b> however, as it is referred to as a castrum in 1301 and 1333, and a castrum dirutum in 1478.

25|$|Although {{investigations}} of higher cognitive processes, such as navigation and mental rotation are limited, the astronauts frequently {{report that the}} spacecraft interiors look longer and higher than they actually are, {{and a reduction in}} the perceived height of three-dimensional objects is observed in-flight compared with pre-flight, suggesting an alteration in the mental representation of three-dimensional cues in weightlessness. Perception is a model of the brain, a hypothesis about the world that presupposes the Newton's laws of motion. These laws change in weightlessness and, therefore, one could expect changes in the mental representation of objects’ shape and distance during spaceflight. The rare investigations carried out in space so far have not demonstrated drastic changes, probably because the CNS continues to use an internal model of gravity, at <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> short <b>while.</b> It can be speculated that the way of processing three dimensions will be more developed after a long absence of a gravitational reference.|$|R
50|$|Through the 1970s and 1980s, Hwa Rang Do grew {{throughout}} California and {{the adjacent}} {{states as well}} as making its mark on the international martial art scene. Both Joo Bang Lee and Joo Sang Lee performed in expo style demonstrations in the south west United States, particularity in California and Arizona, as well as on TV shows including “That's Incredible!” and “Unknown Powers”. Notably, Hwa Rang Do students who trained under the Lee brothers such as Michael Echanis (1950-1978), a Vietnam vet and special forces officer who was fundamental with Hwa Rang Do's involvement with the US Army Rangers and Special Forces brought additional credibility to Hwa Rang Do's martial art training. Because of what was being offered, many martial artist during this time became interested in Hwa Rang Do and started training in the art, at <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while.</b> Notable names included Graciela Casillas, who later through her involvement with Kempo-Karate, became the first female World Champion of professional full-contact Karate.|$|R
