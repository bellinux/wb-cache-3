25|$|Proxy {{data from}} one of the studied sites show rapid +8°C {{temperature}} rise, in accordance with existing regional records of marine and terrestrial environments. Notable is the absence of documented greater warming in polar regions. This implies a non existing ice-albedo feedback, hence suggest no sea or <b>land</b> <b>ice</b> was present in the late Paleocene.|$|E
25|$|Two main {{mechanisms}} {{contribute to}} observed sea level rise: (1) thermal expansion: {{because of the}} increase in ocean heat content (ocean water expands as it warms); and (2) the melting of major stores of <b>land</b> <b>ice</b> like ice sheets and glaciers. Based on figures from between 1993–2008 two thirds (68%) of recent sea level rise has been attributed by melting ice, and roughly one third has come from thermal expansion.|$|E

25|$|A giant {{impact crater}} beneath the Wilkes <b>Land</b> <b>ice</b> sheet was first {{proposed}} by R. A.

25|$|During the Quaternary Period, {{the total}} volume of <b>land</b> <b>ice,</b> sea level, and global {{temperature}} has fluctuated initially on 41,000- and more recently on 100,000-year time scales, as evidenced most clearly by ice cores for the past 800,000 years and marine sediment cores for the earlier period. Over the past 740,000 years there have been eight glacial cycles. The entire Quaternary Period, starting 2.58 Ma, {{is referred to as}} an ice age because at least one permanent large ice sheet—the Antarctic ice sheet—has existed continuously. There is uncertainty over how much of Greenland was covered by ice during the previous and earlier interglacials. During the colder episodes—referred to as glacial periods—large ice sheets at least 4km thick at their maximum also existed in Europe, North America, and Siberia. The shorter and warmer intervals between glacials are referred to as interglacials.|$|E
25|$|During glaciation, {{water was}} taken from the oceans to form the ice at high latitudes, thus global sea level dropped by about 110 meters, exposing the {{continental}} shelves and forming land-bridges between land-masses for animals to migrate. During deglaciation, the melted ice-water returned to the oceans, causing sea level to rise. This process can cause sudden shifts in coastlines and hydration systems resulting in newly submerged lands, emerging lands, collapsed ice dams resulting in salination of lakes, new ice dams creating vast areas of freshwater, and a general alteration in regional weather patterns on a large but temporary scale. It can even cause temporary reglaciation. This type of chaotic pattern of rapidly changing <b>land,</b> <b>ice,</b> saltwater and freshwater has been proposed as the likely model for the Baltic and Scandinavian regions, as well as much of central North America {{at the end of the}} last glacial maximum, with the present-day coastlines only being achieved in the last few millennia of prehistory. Also, the effect of elevation on Scandinavia submerged a vast continental plain that had existed under much of what is now the North Sea, connecting the British Isles to Continental Europe.|$|E

Glaciers in the Canadian Arctic were near equilibrium between 1960 and 2000, losing 23 Gt of ice per year between 1995 and 2000. Since this time, Canadian Arctic glaciers have experienced a sharp increase in mass loss in response to warmer summer temperature, losing 92 Gt per year between 2007 and 2009 [...]|$|E

These are based on applying the Scatterometer Image Reconstruction (SIR) algorithm to produce enhanced resolution no images.
